2,worked for less than a month,"Three weeks after inserting, the fridge light said needs replacement. Called the company (Whirlpool had a phone number with their literature) and they said sorry they can't verify the water quality, did I want a service call? My water provider services 10,000 people and noone complained about the water filter in their refrigerator. I consider the agent on the phone to be arrogant and the product obviously inferior or defective."
4,Sears Side by Side Filters,"There seems to be a little confusion about the filters for Side by side refrigerators. I found these on line at amazon for $55.00 for a 2 pack and you can buy them at Sears for $50.00 each! No brainer, they are the exact same thing only for another $5.00 you get 2 filters. I changed the filter in like 2 minutes and it is working great."
4,Works fine,"It's a decent filter. The water tastes fine and clean, though sometimes it seems like there's an extra shot of chlorine - but that could be the provider instead of the filter."
3,Product Works,"I purchased this product to replace the factory installed filter, i got it for half the price of the replacement filter at sears and it seems to be working well so far."
4,Great product,"These filters look industrial in nature, and are supposed to last for 6 months. As it was my first time installing this product, I had no prior experience other than pitcher water filters that would be stored inside the refrigerator.I had some trouble removing the old filter from the bottom of the fridge. There is a cap that goes on the filter when it's loaded into the fridge(comes with the fridge) and it needs to stay on the filter when you press the filter ejection button. I had taken off the cap beforehand and it didn't work. Lesson learned.You need to run gallons of water through the filter after installation to allow settling of the material and remove any loose particles in the filter. The great thing is the filter puts water out much faster now with this filter. Maybe because it's new or maybe a new design. Either way I am very pleased with the results."
5,fantastic find!!,We checked at many sites for these filters and by far Amazon had the best deal as far as price and shipping. We received them in a short period of time also. Will definitely buy these again from Amazon. Would not hesitate to recommend Amazon to my friends and family.
5,Good products,Good product with no problems and at a highly competitive prices. Came as promised and you have got to have these with ice and water through door.
3,Its a filter...,"Its a filter, what else to say? I do like Amazons auto resend feature for this product, its discounted and automatic."
5,Works great,"Have had fridge for 4 years using these and they work awesome. We use water a lot and also uses filter for ice. Our fridge tells us every six months to replace it like clock work so that's about the life expectancy of these if you use water and ice daily. Haven't had any issues. Water tastes great! Just be careful, when replacing these you will wind up with air in the lines for a bit so run the water through the fridge a bit to get the air out(It splashes!!) and also the water will look a bit cloudy first glass or two until the air is out. Nothing to worry about though."
5,"Great Value, works well!",Works well with my Kenmore Frig. I was a little skeptical with the low price but our water tastes much better than before with this filter!
3,"Good price, questionable quality","These water filters fit just as well as the ones sold at the Sears store, for a fraction of the price. But after a while they get a little bit of a strange aftertaste if you don't change it AS SOON as the ""change me now"" light goes on. So I think they are not as high quality/value as the originals."
2,item looks old and used,"item looks old and used and has finger prints all over, the old one i was throwing away looked shinier and newer then this one, that why online shoping is risky, cant trust and cant see the product u r buying until u get it... a used filter is worse then not having a filter i think..."
4,Good but Pricey,Pros: The item (s) works just fine.Cons: I personally feel that these companies that produce these filters charge the consumers way too much for the filters.
5,Great,"Fits great on my refrigerator, much cheaper than if I would have purchased it from Sears. Works great for less money"
5,Cheaper than big box stores,I have used these filters for several years and I am pleased with their performance. I don't always follow the filter percentage on the fridge. The two pack is only slightly more than a single at big box stores. Love the savings.
4,PUR refrigerator water filter,"This item is user friendly when installing and I can only guess the filter is working well by tasting the water and ice.I have taste tested this filter and as instructed, the filter should be changed every six months."
5,Works Great,"This is exact replacement, ships on time, a little pricy but better than the store i bought the fridge from!"
4,Replaced my Kenmore Filter,This is the second time I've purchased one of these filters. Pleased then and pleased now. Less expensive than the Kenmore version.
5,"Works great, water tastes great!","I don't know what I can say about this purchase. The water tastes great, so it must work great. I just have to have faith that it is filtering out what it says it does, as I don't have the capacity to test the water coming out of it. Some reviewers said the water coming out of it was slow, but I haven't had any issues with restricted water flow with this device."
5,Excellent buy!,Can't beat the price. These are OE cartridges. Wonder why the OE price is so much higher? Love this bargin.
4,Back To Great Memories Of RUSH Shows,"""Replay x3"" is an awesome DVD box set of RUSH concerts from the 80's. When I watched the Exit Stage Left and the Grace Under Pressure discs, the best memories of seeing RUSH during that time period all came flooding back to me. I did not see the Hold Your Fire tour, however the third DVD A Show Of Hands made me wish I had. Even though the video quality of these discs is not that of R30, they are still enjoyable to watch. I selected DTS mode for all 3 DVD's and thought the audio quality was very good. I would highly recommend this box set to any avid RUSH fan such as myself."
2,ATTENTION!! Keep your VHS and or Laserdisc versions!!,Horrible compresssed mix just like the other reviews have said. And not up to today standard video. All of the great subtleties of the VHS/Laserdisc versions audio wise are gone. My advice would be to purchase a good DVD Recorder and make your own copies from your originals and keep this new version for the day that those wear out. Sorry guys-I wish I could say I'm happy with this but like a previous reviewer said...refer to the Led Zep DVD.
4,Great resource,"This book is very useful and moves one beyond a pure rote method of memorization. I've always had difficulty remembering the verse reference that should be associated with the text, especially in passages that I don't know well.As an aside: I highly recommend using Memverse.com to memorize your verses rather than writing them out on flash cards. It's far easier to keep track of your progress and does a good job of focusing you on the verses you don't know well."
5,Yes is works.,i purchased with the idea that this was another one of those things threw together. i was surprised to see how well it really works. I would recommend to my friends. Very nice product. Thank you Amazon.
3,stays on,Like the textured of gloss for everyday and work...I like the way it stays on....great for day and over another lipstick at night.
5,HUSSEIN FATAL-AN OUTLAW CLASSIC,"this album is an example of a street classic.it didnt get tha promotion it deserves but i know 1 thing,2pac and kadafi would be very proud of fatal with this masterpiece.go get this album if you dont got it because its well worth your money.no bull****."
4,Belkin Pure AV Digital Coaxial Audio Cable,The Belkin Digital Coaxial Cable fits and works well on my Blu-ray Disc player. Met my expectations for the product.
4,Serves it's purpose!,"I bought this sometime last year for an older sound system/dvd player combo but could not use it as the older system did not have a digital in on the audio receiver/dvd player. I recently bought a stand alone audio receiver and use this to transfer all audio from the TV to the receiver as the receiver was purchased used and doesn't have HDMI in on the receiver itself. It works great to send the audio from the TV to the receiver. No problems, great product!"
4,Good coax cable,"It is sturdy, with very solid connections. Not very flexible. It has straight connections. Consider whether your application needs L-shaped connections."
2,A digital cable is a digital cable.,"If it's digital, it doesn't matter how ""nice"" the cable is. It makes no difference to the digits; it either works, or it doesn't. It's analog cables that you need to worry about quality with.5 star product, minus 3 stars for misleading marketing and an inane ""list price"" near $45."
5,Great sampling of Weller's offerings,"Paul Weller is for the most part unknown in America, which of course is a shame. I have been fortunate enough to have a British friend who introduced me to a wide variety of British artists I would have otherwise missed - Weller included.I think this CD is a great starter for anyone curious about Weller's music - it has a good variety of songs from loud rockers to soulful ballads.I especially recommend this if you are a fan of blue-eyed soul - Weller is at the top of his game belting out soul."
5,Cold And Scary,"I just read The Long Winter written by Laura Ingalls Wilder. The main characters are Ma, Pa, Mary, Laura, Carrie, and Grace. This story mostly takes place on the prarie. A lot of blizards and storms happen. I mean ALOT! Laura and Carrie go to school but, guess what happens there. It is 20 to 50 degrees below 0.Will Carrie be able to make it home, with her thin bones? Will they get lost? Their town is running out of food. People are worried. Two people go to get food. But do they get back in time? Do they make it back at all? Do they even make it there? Find out by reading this book!"
4,The long winter...,"This is the most intense of the Little House books, in my opinion. I finished it with a greater appreciation of Laura, and her strength in the face of adversity. It was Laura who sat with her father twisting sticks of hay until her fingers were so swollen and sore she could barely move them. The moment when Pa stood up from his chair, shook his fist and screamed defiance at the blizzard was a powerful moment for me. And at last, it ends with the Chinook blowing and a long-delayed Christmas feast. It was the perfect ending."
4,You should try this book!!!!!!!!,"if you like reading books about animals and people who work hard to get what they want,then you will like this book. I like this story,personally, because it tells a story about a family caught in a blizzard with little food and no places to go to get food because there are no trains and there is hardly anything for them to do but wait. You should try this book because you will love the story about a family who is fighting to save their lives. I guarantee you will enjoy reading ""The Long Winter""."
5,Great family listening.,"This CD and the other Little house CD's are great to listen to as a family, we have all enjoyed them."
2,Audio version,"I love this story. I love all the Little House stories and I wanted to share them with my children. We have so many books at home and too many to read, so I thought I'd share my favorites from my childhood on CD with them in the car. We are loving the story, but it is soooooo hard to listen to this narrator. She pronounces Laura as ""Lar-a"" as in star-a, instead of Lore-a. I've tried to get past it, but it sort of starts to grate on you. And when she tries to do Carrie's voice, or the girls laughing, it is like nails on a chalk board. And oh, when she tries to sing Pa's songs with the fiddle I have to turn it off. She hits the notes and is in tune, but the texture of her voice is infuriating. She is a talented reader, and I appreciate her efforts, but, oh my... it is a bit hard to listen to. Not at all soothing."
1,it doesnt work..........period,"I bought this as a gift for my wife for Christmas.......its a replacement for a VERY similar cuisinart coffee maker(without the programability feature)that worked just fine. The first time we tried it, it steamed up made a lot of noise and then shut down.........no coffee........i tried it again, now it simply shuts off after a minute, once again no coffee.....Cuisinart's phone is busy, busy, busy......I sent an email, let's see if i get a response......"
3,Rubber tips stain butcher block counters,"We bought the Cuisinart to replace another similar coffeemaker that finally died. The Cuisinart is a fine coffeemaker and we like its programmable feature. The only problem we have had is with the four rubber tips on the base. We recently had butcher block counters installed in our kitchen and the rubber tips left brown spots on our counter-top that we have not been able to remove. I wrote to Cuisinart about this problem and am still waiting for an answer. For now, we have the coffeemaker sitting on a metal sheet."
5,Makes great coffee,-Makes great coffee-very easy to use-Makes HOT coffe and keeps it HOT for a long time
4,Waiting for the unexpected?,Have read most of the pros and cons in the buyers review section and felt the thermal coffeemaker was worth a try. I was tired of transferring fresh coffee to two thermos bottles.I love this product. I agree the cap can be cantankerous to line up. But the coffee it makes is excellent and retains its heat for a long time. I will keep in mind the review about the button under the filter to prevent overflowing. I like the longer pouring lip versus that found on other carafes.
1,Shocked Cuisinart Would Put Their Name On This,"As the owner of several Cuisinart products, I was surprised when this product arrived up on my doorstep. And not pleasantly surprised. Everything about it indicated that this was not the same quality Cuisinart that I had come to expect. It was flimsy, the filter holder did not line up when shut, and it took several attempts to get the lid to align properly on the carafe. But it was a Cuisinart after all so I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately my first impressions held true. After three uses, the spring mechanism in the filter holder came apart. Also, pouring coffee out of the carafe is a time consuming activity - the coffee dribbles out when set to ""pour"". When the carafe is almost empty, the coffee splashes out, making a mess if you are not ready for it. At twice the cost of several other insulated carafe models, it is time for me to try another brand."
5,Adam Frey is amazing!,"I play tuba and I recently had a workshop and a private lesson with Adam where he played Flight of the Bumblebee at top speed, all 12 major scales in less than 30 seconds, and a song using multiphonics (playing and humming a different note at the same time) that sounded impossible! I'd never imagined someone could be this amazing at a low brass instrument but he is. He's really amazing and he deserves all the fame and recognition that he gets."
5,This is a book is filled with the creatvity of music,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old son who loves music. I found myself reading and making music based on the flow of the words. Everytime we read we create different music. This is his favorite relaxtion book. We went to a music feast and he yelled out ""Pluck a fat bass. Play me a ace."" to the bass player. Who smiled and proceeded to do just that... This is a rich and well written book."
2,So So Product,It left too much of the tortilla around the circumference with no filling and the whole outcome was so so at best. I will try a time or twoagain but I'd say save your money.
5,Quesadilla Fun,"What a fun gadget! It is easy enough for kids to use with little supervision. It works great as long as you follow the instructions and don't over fill it. If you like super cheesy quesadillas this probably isn't for you, 1/4 cup of cheese isn't alot."
1,Leaky and Messy!,"The quesadilla maker is a great idea, unless you like tomatos and lots of cheese, in which case you have a big mess every time. The tomatos and salsa leak and leave a not too bad mess. If you use velvetta instead of small amounts of real cheese, then the tomatos and cheese combine to make one giant mess. If you are light on your ingredients, then this machine is for you, if you like a jam packed quesadilla then stick with the frying pan."
4,Best Quesadilla Maker out there,"I am on a gluten free diet and the only tortillas they sells coming 8-10 inch size. We had owned one of these Quesadilla makers for a few years but it was getting kind of dirty so I asked for a new one on my wedding registry. The quesadilla maker they got us would not fit the gluten free tortillas, so I took it back and bought another one of these quesadilla makers. I make pretty thick quesdillas so I have to put some to weigh down the front. It would be nice if this quesadilla maker had a dual hinge but it still makes a great quesadilla. I took one star off because its a pain to clean."
4,worth it for the price,"We got this for our wedding 6.5 years ago and it has been used a gazillion times. The front handle cracked and eventually broke off so we just had to throw it out - but for the price, it gave us lots of delicious quesadillas. I will be ordering the same one to replace it."
5,Quesadilla maker,"I like this product. I am still playing around with different tortillas, as being gluten intolerant, I can only have 100% corn tortillas. Corn tortillas in this size are hard to find, but I have seen lots of the flour ones in this size. So far, though, stuff has turned out pretty darned good with this maker."
3,"okay, but light duty only","this is designed for 10 inch tortilla shells, which are hard to find where we live, the construction is very light weight as are the plastic handles used to clamp the lid shut during heating, and the machine gets very hot in use, even the plastic 'cool pads' are not sufficient to move the machine around once it heats up. All in all I can make comparable quesos in a microwave with a ceramic plate, and a lot less fuss."
2,Very tricky,"I don't know about anyone else, but I can't ever find perfectly round tortillas. And I certainly can't find them perfectly round and the exact diameter of this quesadilla maker. But if your tortillas are very far off the mark, you're looking at an ungodly mess. Cheese, oil, or salsa is going to be coming out the edges of your quesadilla. If the tortilla is a bit short, the mess is inside the machine. If the tortilla is a bit too large, it's all over the counter and the outside of the machine. If you have to do tortilla surgery in order to get the dang quesadilla made, you might as well just make it in a skillet on your stovetop. I can guarantee you that a skillet is going to be way easier to clean than this machine."
4,Nice Product,Nice product for the price. Great for throwing in left over meats and veggies for a quick meal.
3,"Plodding survey, now outdated","It's pretty much of a trot. One vampire film after another. On the plus side, the author summarizes other critics' ideas so you can avoid getting too entangled with academic stuff. On the minus, the book is outdated (pub'd in the 90's). David Skal's ""Hollywood Gothic"" is much better and more fun. Another book co-written by Alain Silver is also more useful and has been updated."
4,Very nice but not every song in the movie,"Of course, Sammy Davis Jr. can sing 100 times better than Rex Harrison. It's a very nice album and good interpretations of each song by SDJ. BUT, I was a bit disappointed that the song about being a vegetarian was not included."
3,It works,"I dont know what the difference between the 9080A and the B, the 9080B is hard to get in the battery slot but it will go. Talked to Panasonic about this, and the B is the correct battery. Maybe I've dropped my drill to many times."
5,A classic,"This is one of the best album of warrant, great cd, included the great song cherry pie, recomended for fans of glam and hard rock"
3,3 and a half stars,"Nowadays it's not ""cool"" to say that warrant was a great band!!. However this was a really cool band when ""cherry pie"" went out. This album has some really good songs and it reminds me when I was a teenager. I really love the song ""blind faith"""
3,Clean,"They had two double-platinum albums and three Top Ten singles, one of the most popular late 80s metal bands. This album Cherry Pie, clean or not, is one of their best, even though it came in 1990. Later albums failed to chart, outiside of one gold album. Key tracks are: Cherry Pie, Uncle Tom's Cabin and I Saw Red. Not a bad group nor a bad album."
1,what the hell happened,"The entire article is one page, almost 400 words. No way to contact the seller, what a joke."
1,some monster movies are so bad that not even I can like them,"This is a lousy formula film: scientists finds mysterious monster, it escapes, then, well, you can guess. This is so bad that it is not even good for laughs. The acting is wooden, and even the Tibetans are speaking in Japanese! There are no good characters, and plots twists are thrown in haphazardly for deus ex machina purposes. Not recommended. I am an old monster movie connoisseur, but some are so poor that nothing much good can be found in them."
2,Lee Wilder turns in a borefest this time around,"I kind of dig the other two Lee Wilder movies I've seen, Killers From Space with Peter Graves, and Phantom From Outer Space. The actor who played the professor in PFOS has a small role here. Snow Creature, however, is a pretty boring King Kong rip about a botanical expedition in the Himalayas that turns into a Yeti hunt when the wife of the American's guide is whisked off by one of them. A Yeti is captured after a cave in that kills his mate and cub, and gets shipped back to the good 'ol USA for exhibition. Amusingly, things get held up at customs by immigration when it can't be determined wether Yeti is man or beast. The creature escapes to the sewers of Los Angeles, occasionally popping out of a manhole to kill or terrify someone. Wouldn't you be agitated if your family was murdered and you were kidnapped, held in a refrigerator, and dumped in a strange city? Pity the Yeti, children, pity the Yeti. Not much to waste your time on here."
5,Very Happy,"My first impression was fantastic when I lifted it off the shelf at UPS. 20lbs. ""Wonderful!"", I thought. I got it home, packed up my old 17"" HP CRT (heavy/bulky) and pulled out the VX900 and all of it's cables (kind of intimidating at first). The setup instructions were clear in the booklet, but they failed to mention some simple steps (removing the panels from the back of the monitor to hook up the cables). After I stared at it for a few minutes, I mananged to get the panels off and plug it all in. I didn't even hook up the speaker/microphone cables based on other reviews on the speakers. The image is big, flat, and wonderful.My only other complaint (besides the hook-up issue) is the annoying chirp/squeak the screen control buttons make when you use them. I haven't checked on if I can mute them or if there's actually just something wrong with my monitor.Overall, I'm very happy with it. It's my first non-CRT monitor, so I can't compare it to anything else. It's definitely a good buy."
2,Only for Diehard Anderson Fans,"This is an insubstantial little novella or novellete which is probably not worth paying the cover price for. It belongs more in a short works collection. I actually enjoyed this more than the long and ponderous Harvest of Stars (I haven't read the second book in the series because of it.) It seemed obvious to me that Nicol was being manipulated by the Lunarians all along so it was no big surprise. I didn't find the ending very satisfying either. The illustrations didn't seem to complement the storyline very well, except for the one with the robot at the end which is a scene which does appear in the book. The illustration of Falaire isn't how I pictured her as described in the book."
2,The longest outline of a story I ever read.,"This is about the worst fiction book, of any type, that I have ever read.He never fleshed out any of the background scenery at all. What little background was provided never had anything more than the bare basics. And those seemed more like he had written an outline and published it.This also followed on to the characters. Very one dimensional. One guy was a confused poet, who never seemed to be unconfused, and he was the main character. The rest of the characters were just as bad.There was absolutely no foreshadowing of any of the events. And it seem very disjointed with no indication which events happened before, after or concurrently with one another.And there was no interaction with any characters that did not pertain to the story. Think of one of those crappy British SF series. That's what it read like.In other words - Save your money!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Harvest the Fire is a fairly short book. It is part of a series, and I have not read any of the rest of them, this one being part of a SFBC deal I think.A future poet becomes involved with some revolutionaries that don't like machine intelligences being in charge of things. A pretty unmemorable novel."
3,Fast-paced hard sf,"The storylines here develop from a strong focus on detailed technology that seems completely real-even if the characters seem slightly less real. I wouldn't call it one of my favorite sf books, but I liked it, even without reading the first two books in the trilogy. I also liked the artwork and the book's fast pace."
2,100% Failure Rate,"I have owned four of these units over the last 5 years. Every single one has died with the exact same issue. Store bought DVDs will attempt to spin-up several times and then display the ""no disc"" error. Computer-generated DVD discs (avi, mpg, divx) will continue to play normally.The company has been helpful in repairing them which is why I give 2/5 instead of 1/5.While they worked they were great. Functional, affordable. It is a shame that every single one broke within 2 years of purchasing it."
4,Failures are probably power related,"I bought a Philips DVP642 which failed after 4 months. The warranty was only 3 months. So I picked up a DXP1000. It failed after 16 months with a ""no disk"" error. But I think this was because of my erratic power. It failed right after my UPS failed. At the same time 2 DVD drives on my PC failed without the protection of the ups. It appears DVD drives and players are particularly sensitive to power irregularity. I bet many of the reviewers failures were caused by not using a UPS. I will order another Avayon. One advantage of the Avayon over the Philips is the switch in the back to disconnect the power. When my Philips failed they told me I should have been unplugging it when not in use."
4,Avayon DivX player,"So far plays all DivX files, MP3s, and some XviD files.The interface could be a bit better, but not bad.The quality is excellent. Very easy to use.For VCD and SVCD the searching causes the audio to be out of synch."
2,Not believable or true to life and hard to follow the point,"I found this book a little common place and not up to her standards. An aritcle about her life after her mother's death in a magazine was much better. This book had children burning down houses in a development and was hard to follow the point of the whole thing. It didn't mirror any family with which I'm familiar. She can do better, and maybe should stick with subjects she has experienced."
1,"If there was a zero stars, we would have picked that.","This was an awful video. At the same time I purchased this video, I also purchased four other baseball videos, made by other people. They were informative, with a lot of detail. This tape however, was nothing I would want anyone who was learning about baseball, or teaching the game of baseball to see. Dick Williams should refund everyone who actually bought this garbage. Buy Jerry Kindall, or Play Ball the Major League Way instead. They are well worth it!"
1,Expensive and limited,"This might seem like it would be a great item; however, you cannot put any memory cards into it. You are FORCED to pay for the service plan in order to have it only display a maximum of 30 photos a day. Music isn't supported, let along videos. REALLY bad gift choice."
2,had hopes!,"I had high hopes for this version, but it let me down greatly! Don't mess with success, accept no substitutes!"
4,Use with a BOOM!,"I've had this microphone for over a year and I can definitely say that this is better than an on-board mike. However, it doesn't have a long audio range, which forces you to get closer than usual. We made a boom pole and tested it to pleasant results...the audio was nice, clear, and understandable. So if you plan to use this microphone, I recommend you get or make a boom pole. If you're serious about filmmaking you should have a boom pole anyway. There is a BIG difference between recording audio from camera mount and recording audio with a boom, you'll be satisfied."
2,Disappointing,"I have played rugby for many years. I was excited when I saw this game, but am very disappointed by the performance. The camera angles make it very difficult to tell when you have the ball. One second you're running back on defense and the next you have the ball and are running backward. The graphics are very poor, not anywhere near PS2 quality. More control of how the backline is set up and being able to reposition players waiting for the kick off would be handy.On the other hand my son who has never played rugby loves the game.I echo the advice of the people who say rent this game, unfortunately it appears to have disappeared from rental places and toy stores alike. Good luck trying to find it."
4,It's not Madden,"If you know little about the sport, then the game's appeal can only be so strong. Although it's not as flashy as Madden Football, any rugby geek will view this game as an essential. I view this game as an essential.All of the EA time and effort is there, but the direction pad tapping becomes tedious in those scrums, mauls, and rucks. With a little joypad adjustment the scrums are mustard. The rest of the game is great! Beautiful tackles and exciting runs!Cheers"
3,Is this a joke??,I can't believe the company that makes Madden put this out. The graphics are terrible. It looks like either PS1 or N64. The camera is far away and the words are very hard to read. It is entertaining if you are a rugby fan but not for anyone else. The graphics are a disgrace I cant believe EA Sports put this out with a clear conscience.
3,Pretty good...,"This is a helpful tool, except fot the fact that some of the inforamtion is not up to date, i.e. hotels/restaurants closed, hotel name changes. I realize that bewteen the time of print and sell is a couple months, but wouldn't it make sense to add a notes page of any changes before putting out for sale. Also some pictures of locations would be good to help in directing someone to the locations listed. Condsidering they have never been before."
3,Very Tasty,"I found this product to be very tasty, but due to my age, a little hard on my brittle teeth."
2,Logo peeling off,"After about a year, the whole white sticker with the logo began to peel off and was unable re-secure with glue. Have since found markers that are embossed or molded the loco."
1,dont waste your money,spend a little more an buy something really good. this tools are gonna break in the first use.
3,Not what I expected,"Don't buy this book expecting to learn all about fan collecting. There is virtually no introductory information other than how old fans are graded. Lot's of detail about certain brands (Westinghouse, Emerson and GE) but not much on other manufacturers. Also, level of detail very inconsistent - almost seems like pages are missing. Little black and white photos also leave a lot to be desired. Probably a good reference to have, but didn't really fit my need."
4,3 cards (not a pad),"You might be confused (as I was) by the description referring to ""a pad of 15 QPcards"" but it's actually only 3 cards. That said, the cards are a good size for carrying in the camera bag, and come in a resealable envelope."
3,Recent Artifact,"It's rather late to be commenting on this well-intentioned 2002 anthology. However, researchers into post-soviet, anti-capitalist thinking may find the publication helpful. On one hand, there's really little here in the way of lasting political or theoretical value. On the other, the 300 pages do provide the reader with a good idea of just how dispersed and inchoate most anti-capitalist thinking is in the wake of the soviet demise. The shadow of Marx still looms large over the rebellious landscape suggesting that some 21st century reckoning amounts to a major order of business. However, don't look for anything on Iraq or the brutal resurgence of Western imperialism. Were the book updated, I suspect the contents would be meatier. All in all, a minor book on a major subject."
1,Spare me,Couldn't get past the sarcastic spoiled wealth to be entertained or care about these people. To be fare however it was made clear these people only cared about getting high and their own needs. Trying to be a kinder bigger person let me say I hope everything works out for them anyway. Just not going to watch this any further to find out!
5,It's all one piece,"This is a wonderful resource for anyone with the intuition that spirituality is a seamless garment that necessarily respects all life. World peace isn't just the cessation of humans warring against other humans; it's also the end of human deprecations against animals. In this cleverly titled work, Judy McCoy Carman helps us come to a better appreciation of that truth by reminding us in beautiful reflections and heartfelt prayers that all life is sacred. Highly recommended as a book to meditate on."
2,Oh Please,"i love mr.mister and richard page!, when i got this cd i was Very dissapointed! pure glam music which for the most part is weak.the so called ""good"" songs are not even that, who's wrong, who's right (kenny loggins duet) is a failed attempt, sailors song is decent and track 1 is awful, avoid steve george singing.... LEAD on 1 track.yea yea aor, but bad aor.and ""pages"" 1980 is not much better, although ""pages"" 1st cd (japan) is only good for philip bailey appearence.unless your a completist, AVOID!"
1,Dont Waste Your Money,"Im 13 and just got this game. total waste of money. Sure, there are lots of questions and the use of the remote makes it a little more interesting. Other than that, its an annoying piece of scrap metal. It asks a question and the person holding the main peice records if its right or wrong. The person who gets the most points at the end wins. Nothing but answering questions. If you ask me, i would recomend a much more fun Monopoly or The Game Of Life becuase this game is just plain Boring."
3,An interesting angle for a true crime book,"Unlike the recent books by Jack Douglas, this book takes the side of the defense, arguing that serial murderers are victims of their deplorable upbringing and brain damage from abuse. However, it also seems to be implying that there are no serial murderers that aren't deranged, so all of them should be innocent by reason of insanity."
3,Flawed but worth reading,"There is much useful information in this book. The relationship between neurological defects, mental illness and child abuse as precursors to violent behavior seems irrefutable. I thought Dr. Lewis' train-of-thought, meandering writing style detracted from her message, however. While she made the point several times that her practice was not a celebrity practice, her wide-eyed reaction to celebrity killers made me wonder whether this was by choice. Specifically, Dr. Lewis' need to report 3 times, I believe, that she was the last woman to kiss Ted Bundy was disconcerting to say the least. That said, this is an important book for those involved or interested in criminal law, forensic psychology, or social services. I would suggest reading it in conjunction with Base Instincts by Dr. Pincus, who figures heavily in Dr. Lewis' book."
2,Ughh... so so... I guess,"Well you gotta give the game some credit, for its orginality at least. I've never seen a game like this before with a sim city view as you rescue innocent victims or chase down criminals. Now for the negatives. The game has terrible sound. The same music plays repeatedly over and over again throughout every single mission and that ""accident"" voice gets really annoying (u'd know if you played the game). Next, on to graphics. YUCK! C'mon, the city looks like a mess of jagged lines. What a terrible sim. Then, the controls: HARD!!! Don't think you'll ever get passed the first mission. Overall, a good rental but nothing more!"
3,A Challenge But Not Brilliant,"City Crisis when you first play it seems to be a brilliant game, but eventually it seems that that this game has no staying power. In the game you take the role of a pilot who helps to assist the police in chasing criminals, or you could be puting out fires and saving people from high-rise buildings. Yes this is an original style of game and it is fun to play but its not a game that i would go back to in a hurry"
1,Give me a break with the sept 11th review(it still sucks),"The concept was very original and when I saw it, it seemed like a good rent. I rented it and the graphics were terrible. It reminded me of the Super Nintendo days. Despite this games originality, it was terrible. You won't get used to the controls for a while, and by the time you do you'll be tired of this stupid game."
2,1 star is even to much for this game,"this game sucked. No matter how good i did i couldn't get past the first level. i got perfect scores and perfect ratings and still stuck on the first level.so gameplay-1. Controls on the other hand were pretty good. it was similar to a real one with the joystick and all. the graphics were also good. so these categories-4. many more choppers would have been greatly appreciated. three is not a good selection. so overall, this game was a wasted 5 bucks, and i dont recomend it to anyone else."
1,a gamer from New Haven,This is THE WORST PS2 game ever to infiltrate the market. It is worse than Tiger-Heli for the NES. Don't waste your money with this piece of garbage. Buy GTA3 or Metal Gear Solid 2.
1,not appropriate for family; excessive profanity,Several uses of the F word in a short time along with milder (but still unacceptable) profanity make this movie unsuitable for family viewing. If a rating or a warning was present indicating the presence of foul language I would simply have turned it off. Since I wasted my money and time on a movie of this nature I feel cheated. I stopped it after playing only a short time. It's a shame but this is just another movie with great acting and a real message that's trashed up and it had real potential.
3,Nice item But........,This is an attractive well made tailgate protecter but mine came with no attachment tape or screws. I had to buy adhesive to put it on my truck so it will cost you 3 or 4 bucks more.
1,lacking....,"I did not enjoy this book. The main character, David, is so shallow and dim, it was very difficult to muster any compassion for his struggles. The writing style was hard to read as well. The author uses a lot of short choppy sentences which made me feel like I was reading a telegraph! It was really depressing to think that a human could actually exist in the main character's condition; there was no depth to this man (or anyone other character in the book for that matter)! Get a life, get a real job, a real brain and a real heart, a strong does of integrity, then maybe the book would have been an interesting read."
1,Dreadful just dreadful !,"This book was appalling , it was profoundly unfunny and dull prehaps the author should keep his day job at MTV"
4,Laugh out loud funny!!,"I loved Booty Nomad. It reminded me of many interesting situations with women in my own life, and the one-liners were hilarious. I can't wait to read it again. It's mainly a book for guys. I think that most girls would find it completely chauvinistic. Trust me guys, you'll love it. You'll support him, and feel sorry for him at times. You'll totally relate to all of his problems, especially how to deal with 10 different types of women at the same time. A highly reccommended read."
3,"Same age and same city as David, the main character.","A story about love, with many cliches and stale jokes littered throughout. The first three quaters of the story are rather emotionless. If you havn't heard the jokes before you must be living in a bubble of sorts. Seems as Scott Mebus is upset about being dumped by a girl in much the same fashion David, the main character, dumped the Eater of Souls.The highpoint of the book was the ending, mostly because the dumb jokes faded and I finally felt an ounce of compassion for Daivd.Overall it's a quick easy read that deals with a man breaking up with his semi-psycho girlfriend."
5,Amazing. Just Amazing.,"I liked ""Enjoy The Melodic Sushine"", and was bummed when I heard the band would go on without their singer and primary songwriter. It turns out, this band is miles beyond what they were with Daniel Wiley. Now the songs are no longer frivilous faux hippy pop, which was entertaining, but not something I ever took very seriously.This album is utterly fantastic. ""When You Come Around"" is mind-blowing and with the exception of ""Just A Satelite"" which is not that great, every track is amazing. It's like the Oasis album I've always been waiting for, with hints of Americana (ie. Wilco, Jayhawks, Bob Dylan). The songs a precisely written, with some of the most outstanding melodys and chord structures I've heard in a long time. These are songs that you'll want to listen to over and over. Buy it, even at the import price."
2,Not willing to invest time and money with this,"I finished the first bottle which went pretty quick with all they tell you to take. I am not sure what I was looking to find, I thought it would last longer to see better results. This would get real expensive to stick with it, and no way to tell if it is any better than just Saw Palmetto alone."
2,Nothin' happenin' at the Hotel du Lac,"This is yet another excercise in semi-autobiographical snoring by an otherwise capable writer.Why do they DO this? Yeah, yeah, the writer's life is a lonely one, full of self-doubt, sackcloth and ashes.Our hero, Edith, is in a self-imposed exile at some stuffy old hotel, doing penance for an errant love affair. She takes long walks, broods, takes more long walks, broods some more. Meanwhile, the only diversion for the hapless reader is a collection of societal parasites killing time at the same hotel.Give this one a wide berth."
3,Slow moving read,It was a bit of a disappointing read to me. Slow in places. Lacking in color. In the end I didn't feel that I really knew who Edith Hope was. Strange irony in her last name as there seemed to be very little hope in this book. Sadness prevails.
4,Is Nearsightedness Fatal?,"I saw a film version of Hotel du Lac on TV one night and was absolutely hooked. I found the book and read it right away.I love the fact that the narrator can't be trusted. Actually she does not trust her own judgement either so we can't laugh at her behind her back.Not much plot: a not so young woman who writes romance novels is banished to the Hotel du Lac for one month for the horrendous crime of not showing up to her own wedding.At the hotel, she meets a cast of characters who keep her and us guessing.What I think is really funny is that despite her mild mannered exterior, the main character is as selfish and cruel in her own way as any one else at the hotel. We overlook it or misinterpret it because she is so colorless."
4,Decent beach read,"I really enjoyed the book. had it with me on a recent get-a-way on the beach, and I couldn't put it down.Quite a bit jammed into 400 pages, but for that matter, its a book that keeps you on your toes.I absolutely pissed myself over the Daytona chapter. It was some of the funniest work that I have ever read."
2,As flawed as Kundera can be.,"I feel like a fool admitting it but I must...Life is Elsewhere although deeply interesting was not deeply satisfying. Kundera does not quite pull off his ideas in his usual breathtaking manner, I mean it is almost there but it is the almost that rips my heart out because it lets me feel like all those philistines I know who disdain Kundera for his arrogance and pompousity. So because I respect Milan too much I refrain from rereading this work which is something I cannot say about every other title of his."
4,An enchanting book,This is one of the amazing novels by Milan Kundera...his lighthearted spirit never abandones while you read. If you enjoy Kundera's novels you will definitely enjoy this one...
1,Spend your time elsewhere.,"I bought the book after reading the 1st chapter where ""the Poet is conceived"". Unfortunately, it was downhill from there.This book tired me out so much with the way it rambled on and on. It seemed far too self righteousness and preachy; it was almost pretentious. It was also difficult to empathize with it's main character who was a pathetic, untalented, mama's boy poet.Having read and enjoyed a few other Kundera books, I really tried to give this a chance. It was a struggle to finish it. If you don't like ending up hating the protagonist, your time is better spent reading something else."
5,"Writing Against Poetry (and Socialism, Too)","This is Kundera's most harrowing book because his hero is a monster. He doesn't mean to be a monster, of course. He is Jaromil, a dreamy young man who only wants to write lyric poetry. But this is Czechoslovakia, 1948 and the Communists are about to seize power. And they know how to make use of a well-meaning young naif like Jaromil who will end up writing propaganda and betraying his friends to the secret police. Kundera is ruthlessly funny about the kind of sentimentality that ends up serving totalitarian ends. A French critic wrote that ""Life is Elsewhere"" is ""the strongest work ever written against poetry."" I would amend that to say it's the one of the strongest books ever written against *Romanticism*. Kundera is completely unenthralled by Utopia. He's seen too many people sent to the gulag in the name of the perfect society. A thrilling, essential novel."
5,A novel approach to poetry.,"Kundera's study of a young poet is both funny and deeplyjarring as he turns his insightful eye against myths whichnot only his characters hold to be true, but most of usoutside the book as well. Following the poet fromconception to death, Kundera weaves a narrative that beginsin comedy and ends in tragedy. He also cleverly weaves instories of other lyric poets, including Shelley, Rimbaud,and the Czech poet Jiri Orten. This is a wonderful storythat is about poetry, but also about changing in a changingworld as well."
2,Boney B one's Not as sharp as you would hope,"T-Bone's back, this time with something a little more funky than before. A very consistent record, seeing as he works with his production partner ""Chase"" for most of the record. Unfortunately, alot of the record is far too monotonous to be fully appreciated. His decision to perform his own BGV's for most of the record really hurts him, esp on ""Can't See Us"", ""Still Preachin'"", ""Rhyme Skillz"" and worst case on ""Our History"". Though a few West Coast classics are delivered - ""Dippin"", ""Pop ya collar"" and ""Welcome to California"". His decision to work with KRS-1 on the title cut is no doubt the low point on the record. The cut ""Our History"" gives props to christian rap's elders (Steven Wiley, SFC, PID, JC crew, D-Boy, IDOL King etc). Wish he included ETW, Transformation Crusade, Washington, Tru $ U, JC & The Boyz etc, still, a decent track. Overall: DISSAPOINTING FOR A TRUE VET LIKE THE BONEY BONE."
1,Gospel rap...huh...I don't get it..is this a joke??,"This CD has few words about Christ...a whole lot of words about his car(s)...I guess with the Holy Spirit chillin with him in the front. Words about how HE and some other cats started the gospel rap game and cats comin out now need to recognize(sounds like boasting to me) and calling people ""busters""..What?? What sets gospel apart whether it's rap, hip-hop country, rock, contemporart etc...is our love for Christ and the love we have for Christ showing through for other people to see. What makes his lyrics or sounds any differnt than puffy, Jay-Z or any other rapper out there...because he say's Jesus every once and a while in his music...PLEASE!! Quit tryin so hard to fit in on secular and Christian. Just let GOD give you a new sound and people will accept. He say's ""if I be lifted up, I will draw all men unto me""...I don't know what T-Bone tryin to draw..."
4,If you want to look at the big picture...,"This is a well crafted overview of the major events of the Vietnam War. It is fairly balanced, and is quite readable. If you are more interested in reading about combat, then I would recommend the works of Keith Nolan."
3,Alpha training mannual,"Not a bad training tool, but if it was KGB/Spetznaz i think there would be more to it.It reads like a basic training handbook....sorry, but disinformation is good except when you offer to sell it to someone.....no cold war......should have covered more CNCTEMA"
4,Cryptograms to Keep You Sharp,A good cryptogram book for folks that like them. Spiralbound makes it very user friendly. Wish the author had published a second volume.
4,Pleased with book,"I'm enjoying this cryptogram book much more than the last one I purchased. The puzzles are not too easy or too hard. The book is a good size, so the puzzles are also."
2,Disappointed,"Please refer to richard's review of this TV (under reviews of the TXM3296HF 32"" DynaFlat HDTV TV), my opinion is frighteningly similar. Not a technophile, but did ample research, read largely positive reviews of Samsung products. Receiving standard digital cable signal, picture was fuzzy, grainy--after much adjustment, no improvement. Also purchased at Best Buy. Returned to BB the next day to exchange for the Sony WEGA 32"" HDTV. Will receive TV tomorrow, hope I'm as pleased at richard."
4,"A latter-day ""Catch-22""","Though it is not as good as ""Catch-22"", this novel sparkles with sassy dialogue, military argot and flashy gadgets, becoming, in the process, an authentic account of the technologised conflict which was the Gulf War. It implies how, in the light of how life today is dominated by digital satellite technology, camcorders and computers, everyone has assumed the role of voyeur. The anonymous narrator is a recruit enlisted to fight in the ""hyperral"" Gulf War crisis, in which, by virtue of the hi-tech surveillance equipment employed, the perception of a thing becomes a way of ""manipulating"" it. The book is stuffed with borrowings from such postmodern epigones as Baudrillard, and is far more philosophically complex than one might expect, though redeemed also by its irreverent humour."
2,"More sexual fantasy than shamanism, oh and the poor bees!","The story was up to something, until Buxton's weird sexual fantasy took over the book halfway through and it became pure gibberish. This is not about female sacred sexuality, it is about desire. Note to self: No one is as interested in your own sexual fantasy as you are.Now, I am off to read some books that are really about bees!"
5,Follow the Bee,"This fascinating book will surprise, and might even shake a few people. It's often what happens before some kind of awakening. An adventurer of the mind, sincere and determined,will recognise the taste of a truth and wisdom coming from a very remote past, our common legacy. A reader with an enquiring mind will appreciate the savour of extraordinary adventures.After reading this story, you will never again eat honey in the same way. Follow the bee !"
5,Nice stand!,"I have been using this stand for more than five years. Amazon just reminded me about reviewing! This stand is great. Figuring your best way to mount your specific saw to it in the fashion that will suit you the best is your task. I mounted my 10"" Hitachi Sliding Dual Compound saw on a piece of plywood and then to the mounts that came with this stand. I can use the saw on the floor by itself if I want to or quickly mount to the stand.I do think the wheel design could be a bit better but I just carry it over to where I'm going to work anyway! It's light enough to do that but sets up very sturdy with adjustment on one leg for out-of-level situations.Also has a repetitive cut stop but won't work for all applications of course."
2,Nice Stand,"I think they've listened to everyone about the assembly problems. It now comes assembled except for the saw mount section. But the instructions for what's left are totally incoherent. If you have an outhouse you'll know what to do with them. A good picture is your best bet and then it goes pretty well. As noted by others it is important to balance the saw. I centered the saw fence front with the center of the stand and that worked well; you can fine tune from there if you wish. Aligning the fence parallel with the stand is not easy. My Bosch 5412 has extention bars so I aligned with them using a straight edge and that worked, you can fine tune from there if necessary.When UPS delivered this the box fell completely apart and scattered everything on my porch. I think that's the norm, not the exception. I'd give this 4 stars if TracRac was capable of writing an instruction manual and providing a decent box, and it comes with Bosch's name on it so they are culpable."
2,No sympathy for Mark Jantzen.,"Jim's review was spot on. This story could maybe have worked at about half the length, but with all of the padding, I was beginning to wish that something would fall on the main character's head and get it over with.There are approximately thirty reminders through the book that Jantzen used to be a cop. The author is only slightly subtler--the equivalent of getting bludgeoned with a Wiffle bat instead of a baseball bat--is that SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED IN THE PAST TO HIS FAMILY.Jantzen is a self-absorbed man (another thing you hear again and again) and, because of this, isn't a very sympathetic character. This isn't necessarily a bad thing if the character changes or grows through the course of adventures. Jantzen doesn't. He's still a self-absorbed man at the (very abrupt) end.Usually, when I finish a book, I lend or give it to a friend or the local library. After I finished this book last night, I tossed it in the garbage."
5,Search for Products to enhance the Aging Process,Mind Boosters has been a great help for me and my wife who has Parkinsons. We have been able to find products and help where there is no known cure. We have found no cure but a sense of learning about things that can be of some help for my wife's problem.
2,Dancing Instructions For Texas 2 or 3 Step VHS,"This VHS has good dance instruction and good music. The content is rated 3 or 4 stars. Unfortunately, my copy was distributed by MNTEX Entertainment in low-quality long-play mode. Why they didn't rcord in higher-quality standard-play mode is unknown. They saved a few yards of tape, but it is certainly not worth it just to save a few pennies. The quality of the recording is rated one star."
4,Nice contrast,"""Yellow Fever"" is definitely a more accessible album, more directly linked to the mellow, hypnotic Nigerian highlife/juju pop style, while ""Na Poi"" is more of an experimental, difficult-listening album. It's interesting to hear the two different versions of the song ""Na Poi,"" both extended Fela-style jams, but with radically different approaches... give you a pretty good sense of the kind of stylistic range these guys had. I agree that ""Yellow Fever"" is more fun, but hey... as long as they're gonna throw an extra album's worth of material on the same CD, I ain;t gonna complain. #8-)"
4,Its all here folks,"Mark Bolan and T-rex have issued the ultimate collection of songs.Myself being a long time fan love this album.Bang a gong is still a classic.Although his life was cut short Sept 13,1977 in a car crash,I remember hearing it and was quiet for two days.This is a great album for fans and all the others out there who weren't familliar with his unique style.Definate must at parties."
2,Re recorded ???,"Very disappointed in the quality, I can only assume that the songs were re-recorded and as a result do not sound like the original recordings. I Would not recommend it for a long time fan who would be better served by shopping around for the original recordings"
5,Perfectly Compiles The Years 1968-1976,From Tyrannosaurus Rex first releases in 1968 to T.Rex's last recordings in 1976 this is a great compilation of Marc Bolan and gang's glam/punk offerings. Up-to-date liner notes. Great sound. A Discography of the band's albums. Musician credits on all songs. And release date and album info for each song make this a must not only for T.Rex newcomers but a handy sampler for T. Rex fans the world alike.
1,Disappointing!,The square shape in the back hampers me when I want to turn my head. I would not recommend this to anyone.
2,Handle but NO bit!!,"I got this and also the #1 tripoint screwdriver like it as I wasn't sure which fit the screws in the Nintendo Wii sensorbar. Nintendo didn't apparently think that people have front projector rigs with equipment in the back of the room, and I need about 50' of wire to go around the room for the sensorbar to reach my screen. Since they used a funky weird connector I need to hack the thing to add more wire to it.The other item was fine, but this #0 reversible screwdriver came with missing parts. I got the handle, but no the bit. TechniTool who fulfilled this order item (as well as the similar #1 driver) have been nice about RMAing it, but what a hassle. I never thought I'd buy a screwdriver and not get the whole thing..."
1,Amateur philosophy,"Mr. Leahy is totally uneducated as to the philosophy behind those who work for the advocacy of animals. I'd recommend those interested in this subject to begin with Peter Singer's 'Animal Liberation'. Mr. Leahy's book solidifies my opinion that the animal research community is based on greed, greed, greed."
1,Cruelty Explained,"Oh, ok, now I get it! It's ok to torture and murder animals because we're the masters of universe, and we are so important that we shouldn't even try to change things! Seriously..."
4,good coverage,"This book covers most of the state-of-the-art commercial processor microarchitectures as well as (almost) latest research and development both in academia and industries. Probably one of the broadest coverages among all published architecture book as of today. Well, not quite a textbook like CA:AQA by Hennessy and Patterson though. But it is a nice reference book for folks with architecture backgrounds."
2,I Was Confused,"So one of the features of this charger is that it ""charges both NiCads and Nimh batteries"" - yet the manufacturer's comments state that it charges only Nimh batteries (""for NiCads use charger EY0900B"").The 2002 Panasonic catalogue lists charging times of 90mins for N(3Ah) NIMH batteries; 60mins for F(2Ah) NICAD batteries; and 45mins for C(1.2Ah) NICAD batteries - with this charger."
5,find it games are the best!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THis amazing tube of hidden objects will keep you and your children busy for a good 45 minutes. After the initial try, They would go back to it everyday. They still have not found the PENNEY. That is hidding in the middle somwhere. This toy encourages critical thinking patterns. The user needs to figure out how to rotatethe filler back and forth just right to bring th emiddle peices to the front. THis is not easy though. My children love finding new items tucked in between the filler. It is a surprise everytime you find somthing new. I recommend this to everyone. This would even keep little ones busy rolling it on the ground."
4,Big fun for kids and adults,My husband spent over an hour with this thing trying to find all the objects--he became obsessed! Most are easily found but the last few are a real challenge. This is fun and easy to lose yourself in. Also--no small pieces to pick up or keep up with.
5,A must for the next ski trip!,We take these on every ski trip and they're a blast to watch. Warren Miller never goes out of style. This set has updated music and amazing personalities. Enjoy!
1,Too bad...,"Too bad. I was so excited when I first looked at a couple of the recipes in the book, but the pushing of expensive products that are bought through the Doctor and also through Saks, Bloomingdale and Henri Bendel really makes me crazy.I wish there was someone who would just stick to suggesting products that those of us that need health advice and suggestions can afford...Here is the gyst of the book: eat an omega rich diet, eat the colorful vegetables, and berries and fruits. Nuts are good too.Exercise, take a good multi. Skip paying a fortune for the products that most of us can't afford."
3,Another way to fill your head!,"This is a good plan for those who need to follow some sort of ""diet"" since it suggests that you eat good foods in moderation, but I think a better read is ""The Overfed Head"" by Rob Stevens. Stevens teaches how to learn to pay attention to what your body actually needs instead of filling your head with all kinds of diet regimens. It's much better to let your body's own natural instincts guide your behavior rather than what some diet seller tells you to do!"
3,not practical,"I enjoyed reading Dr. Perricone's scientific research and the basis for his recommendations. However, I would say that 90% of the recommendations are not practical for the average person. Many of the foods and supplements he recommends are hard to find and/or expensive. Of course, he is promoting his own formulations of supplements and topical creams. I felt like I was reading the words of TV infomercial. As far as his diet...cut out the sugar and caffeine and eat more richly colored fruit and veggies and as much Alaskan salmon as you can tolerate. There! now you don't need to buy the book."
1,The Perricone Promise,"Couldn't tell you since I was charged for the book yet never received it! After contacting the dealer numerous times, I never heard back. Horrible service!! I have heard the book was helpful though to others who have read it."
3,good,"The book is in excellent condition....A little hard to do this diet on your own, buying products on your own except the spices..."
5,I read parts of the book on a daily basis,"10 Stars !!!!This book has saved me a fortune. When ever I'm in a slump, I stop trading and read this book again. It always gets me back on track. My main problem was I wasn't letting the market tell me which direction to trade. I was trading on the long side of the market when I should have been on the short side and vise versa. I've stopped watching the tape so closely, and focus now on general market conditions for my long or short signals. Now I don't get caught on the wrong side of the market as much. I feel that you can take many pages of this book and say that each one of those pages is worth far more than the price of admission. That is my honest opinion."
5,Destined to become a classic,"I bought this book because I read the following review by Garbis from Chicago, ""This is the best trading book, of many, which I have read over the past 14 years as an investor and a professional trader. It is the only book which not only describes the many facets of the otherwise complex business of trading, but also goes beyond the academic, and into the PRACTICAL realm! It is written with the benefit of years of a pro's experience, but presented in such manner so to benefit beginners as well as seasoned traders. I highly recommend the financial and the time investment necessary to acquire, read and STUDY this ""how to"" manual.""I have to say that I really enjoyed reading this book and have implemented the strategies it features successfuly. I will not be surprised if the copy I have in my posesion will be worth a fortune one day. This book is destined to become a classic."
4,Historical Freemasonry,Excellent book albeit somewhat spotty at times concerning historical facts. Appears to be more a superb exhibition catalogue than a history.
5,A fine addition for all Masonic libraries,"Mark Tabbert has done a fine job exploring the evolution of Freemasonry in America and giving us a small glimpse of its possible future. It is obvious that he has great affection for the ""craft"" but its very refreshing to see that he has taken the time to respectfully recognize the ties Masonry has had in the development of other fraternal orders and their organizational descendants. There is no mysticism here, only clear documented history and analysis (coupled with outstanding illustrations) which should be of interest to Masons and non-Masons alike who are truly interested in learning more about the world's oldest ""secret"" fraternity."
4,"Oh my god, how great thou are",Grace tackles a lot of territory here and yes she does sing her heart out. Inside Story is such a wonderful song about a family and how they can inspire you. The whole album plays out like an autobiographical journey. She lives in LA and deals with a bunch of sharks but still walks barefoot in Beverly Hills. Through it all she praises God for his inspiration. A very honest and upbeat recording.
2,Oops,When ordering I didn't see that this film is in Japanese!! This was very disappointing as it seems like a wonderful story.
4,excellent survey,"i'm an amateur clarinettist who can't quite get with Bichet's gravelly tone, but every time i listen to the guy i learn something about phrasing, articulation, and new songs. i picked this disk up at Amoeba in LA for $5, but would pay twice that."
2,The Many Tales of What Lies Beneath!,"This book tells the tales and gives the background of the infamous Hollow Earth theory, that there is an entire civilization of advanced ancient beings living within the Earth. Belief in Hollow Earth theory is rare, and as the book describes is often found only among mystics and fringe scientists. Mostly it is a fantasy storybook describing strange creatures and inner earth homonids with marvelous, unknown powers. It does, however, discuss the Nazi command's occult belief in hollow earth and their numerous quests to reach it and come in contact with the 'original Aryans.' If you are one who is led to believe in international conspiracies and the like this book will be of interest to you. It presents the best evidence for the reality of hollow earth- nevertheless, that evidence is thin and often anecdotal. Cool to think about though!"
3,Great account on the discovery of insulin,"This is a thorough account about the discovery of insulin. The beginning of the book is great story-telling, pure & simple. It starts off with the details of earlier research and the treatment of diabetes prior to insulin, and then goes on to tell the suspenseful tale of the research that lead to the discovery of insulin. Bliss provides clear information and notes when there are conflicting accounts of various events.The latter half of the book details the squabbling over credit of the various researchers. While this information was important to include, I did not need such a detailed, blow-by-blow account of the quarrels. I found this section to be quite tiresome to read. I would rather have heard more details about the personal side of the discovery of insulin (ie, more info about the people saved)."
5,Some fellas look and find a rainbow I alwas find rain,"The verse I quoted in the title gives youan idea about the general mood of this album; although Almeida is famous, among other things, for his Brazilian jazz (bossa nova) innovations, there is only a hint of that on this magnificent album...Crossing the genre boundaries, it's a brilliant album of intimate performances by a great singer and a great guitar player... If you like this sort of (maybe unexpected) gems from the Rat Pack, check out Frank Sinatra's album with Antonio Carlos Jobim if you can find it - a more bossa novish outing, but equally satisfying for meFrancis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim....Apparently - some edition of this album have the bonus track ""Misty""; mine doesn't (unfortunately), but it's still a magnificent buy nevertheless!"
4,Great Player,"This cd player is the best cd player ive ever had!The sound is not awful its probably you put it in the Line out.The volume switch is really cool its not a turning one its 2 buttons.The G-Protection is the best also, Ive shaken this like 100 times hard and even dropped it without it skipping at all .For 80 bucks i thought i wasted a little of my money but it but that may be because it comes with a car kit and headphones and alote more things.I would though recommened different headphones because these that come with it are pretty bad.The sony behind the head style is great pair with lots of bass and loud sound."
3,Nice grill but.....,"I purchased this grill on Amazon and I'm very happy with the service Amazon provides. The grill itself is well constructed and I'm sure it'll last for years and years. My only gripe with it is that one side of the grill is hotter then the other. I thought that it was just my grill until I emailed weber that they replied with ""The Weber grills are about 25-50 degrees hotter on the right side then on the left side."" the right side of mine is noticeably hotter then the left, my brother in-law has the same grill and he has the same issue. Over all nice grill but it would be nice to have even heat for the price paid."
5,Pretty AND durable. A hit for Mom and baby!,"I bought this for my daughter at 17 months after seeing her fascination with it at a friend's birthday party. All of the dishes are bright and sparkly; very eye-catching to a toddler. Due to her age I tucked the knives away in a drawer until she is older. All of the other pieces have kept her entertained for countless hours. I was concerned the teapot would be cracked within a week, or the lid would become stripped, but it has proven to be as durable as the rest of the set. It has been 7 months since I purchased this and it is still a favorite. This is a definite ""HIT"" for our family!"
5,"Thick Pick, Soft Sound...","I am the lead guitarist for the band Fatal Blow - Heavy Metal. I usually buy Fender mediums, but I needed to do a few base tracks on my new album. After going over several sample packs of picks I have, this super thick 1.5mm pick did the trick.What sold me on this is, I'm a guitar player and I do not like those huge base picks. I also used one of these thick picks to do some soft background rhythms. Mix it up a bit, because I hate when every song sounds the same.It produces a soft, warm sound that is perfect for base tracks. It also has a nice soft, no slip feel which was perfect for my Doomsday song. I also mix up my leads using different picks and can't wait to give this one a try.I recommend new users get the sample pack. It has every kind of pick out there and go from there. I use several different picks from different brands with this super thick pick being my choice for base and soft, plucky rhythms."
5,None,some of the best recipes ever and they work great in an electric or charcoal smokers can not wait to try moreThere are a lot of recipes to try some that look so good.thanks deborah
2,This show is aweful! (but fun to see),"The Brady Bunch Variety Hour must be worst TV show ever made!The DVD price was right so I decided to buy it..For those who want a slice of the 1970's it is the perfect DVD. The worst part by far is the singing. Especially painful is when the ""Bradys"" sing Baby Face and the Bradys splashing around in the pool dressed as clowns with a really bad laugh track.However it was a OK value for the cheap price!"
4,Be afraid. Be very afraid.,"Mother of God! If you lived through the 1970's--and I did-- why on earth would you want to go back? Brady Redux? Are you serious? Why don't we just go back to Viet Nam while we're at it!If you must watch it, at least watch it with the lights on."
4,SOOO DORKY,"What is up with that last review? Does that make ANY sense at all???Anyway, this show is so lame! I wasn't laughing with it, I was laughing AT it. I had to watch it when I was alone because I would never be able to face my roommate again if he caught me! All the songs were obviously lip-synched. Acting was BOORRRING. I can see why Eve Plumb didn't want to do this! Worth watching for a good laugh."
1,not good,"this is not a very good cd. not worth 16 bucks, pick up something else instead. what happened to the days of cd's that could play front 2 back? last time i remember a lot of those kinds of tapes was '96............"
3,Smaller than I thought,"I bought this jeep for my grandson. It was broken almost before we could get it out of the box. The description given on the product page gave the dimensions of the box, not the jeep, so I thought it would be larger. My grandson loves it, but I was disappointed."
3,Great For Beginners,"A non-intimidating and easy to follow introduction to aerobics. This is a fun, gentle workout that allows beginners to actually move the next day without painkillers or a taunt a spouse. What does this mean? You can come back for more! Kathy's motto is consistency; she encourages the start of a regular routine by creating a safe, short workout that is adaptable for people with different abilities.Familiar music and dance moves keep things interesting. The dancy moves aren't too extreme, nor do they require a lot of space to perform correctly. Great for those needing to ""take it easy"" and ease into exercise in a safe, but effective way."
3,Disappointing...,"As another viewer noted... This is more of a dance video, not a walking tape. I found most of the moves difficult to follow. (I'll stick with the Queen Bee of Walk Aerobics--Leslie Sansone.) I also found it too distracting to watch people with what I consider to be odd body shapes. Thank goodness there were only three to begin with... Definitely too masculine looking, with the exception of the curvaceous, dark haired lady on Kathy's left. She helped to make the difference. (She should be in a Leslie Sansone video!) In all fairness however, I must admit that the studio was absolutely break taking, and I did enjoy most of the music and the energy of all three women. All in all... it was fun to WATCH for entertainment... but not to exercise too."
1,THE DAY PRIEST SOLD OUT.....,"Just forget this album. Trying hard to compete with the prevailing horrible scene of glam-metal and MTV/oriented music, Priest sold out everything they had fought so hard to develop: hard and heavy music, well played solos, different styles of songs (all under the realm of metal).In their place, came puffy hair and make-up, dreaded song titles as ""HOT FOR LOVE"" and ""WILD NIGHTS HOT AND CRAZY DAYS"", all in an obvious attempt to make America once and for all. The video for the subsequent tour is even more atrocious. TURBO is a shame is Judas Priest's catalogue, i do not even recognize the band who recorded it!"
4,OPRAH GET THIS BOOK IN YOU CLUB !,"WOW what book! dave is powerful in his methodsbut it very ""common sense"" what an idiot i waswith my spending habits the book talks right to youbecause dave was one of us doing the exact same thing!i loaned this book to a stuggling friend of mine two weeks latershe was very excited and now is on her way to freedomland!but she loaned it out to other girlfriends i guess i can write thebook off as a lost cause,but as long as im helping others i'll buyanother one its well worth it! YOUR THE MAN DAVE !!!"
5,Great Choice !,"This is an excellent book! Highly recommend. Also, came in great condition, though it was an old library book, and it is an easy read!"
5,Quick Service!,I ordered this book to give as a birhtday gift. I had it in my mailbox much quicker than the time given to arrive. I love that...Thanks!!!
3,This book can help you...,"I've read a couple of Ramseys' books and used to listen to his talk show daily a few years ago. This book is, like a lot of books in this genre, are laden with common sense thinking which we need to hear every once in a while. In fact, we probably need it more than that as media is constantly trying to pry us away from our money.Good book overall especially if you caught in the spend credit rat race.However, I highly recommend The Richest Man in Babylon before reading ANY other personal finance book!"
5,Blowguns,"Great information on different types, how to make and what to use them for. I would recommend this for anyone just starting out in silent weaponry."
3,Kitchen lighting,"I am very pleased with this item. We used 2 over the kitchen island. But it was very frustrating trying to get a complete package from the supplier. The first 2 we ordered were missing pieces, the packaging was damaged and 1 was broken. We managed to salvage parts for 1 light . We reordered and received another with missing parts. Eventually, we had the pair and were pleased with the quality."
2,There are much better products available,"One reviewer wrote they wished they had read reviews before buying. I can't believe the favorable responses this product has received. If you are of short stature and you only average a couple of inches of snow, this scoop may get you by. Otherwise, consider other scoops on the market that are much better both in capacity and ergonomics. The following are some examples: the Garant YPSS26 Yukon 27-1/2-Inch (found at Amazon) or the AMES 24IN ERGO POLY SLEIGH SHOVEL (found at Home Depot). Both of these scoops are far superior and will move snow efficiently while saving your back. The handles are adjustable and long enough to give you leverage to dump or slide the scoop over banks when you have to stack snow.One exception for the Suncast scoop is that it's light and small enough to use to clear a flat or shallow-pitched roof. After buying one of the larger scoops, I left my Suncast at camp for just such chores."
4,Joanne569,"When I first received the shovel, I was amazed at how LARGE it was! It was very easy to put together, took all of 5 minutes. It is very well made. After the first snowfall, I couldn't wait to give it a try. I got the driveway done in approx. 15 minutes. It is capable of moving a very large amount of snow. We recently got about 20 inches of snow. After trying several times, I decided the best way to do it was to go across the width of thedriveway, rather than down, If you go down the driveway, you have to stop and turn it over (it's impossible to lift it!) and drop off the snow several times. If you are anticipating a very large amount of snow, it would be better to shovel several times, rather than wait until the snow piles up very deep. I'd say it was well worth the money!"
3,"Indifferent..it does work, however it is awkward.","I bought one because a neighbor across the street has a larger version of this and he says nothing but good about these type of shovels. I bought this shovel going with that in mind. The problem though, this is to narrow and the handle is to short. I feel it would work a lot better if it was wider and with longer handles. However, when buying it I new the width so I can't say anything bad on that. If you come across one that is wider with longer handles, you would be better off with that. I have it and spent $50 on it so I will continue to use it."
4,"Good item, buy it!","This is a good item for snow that is not too deep and works very well on it. For deep snow, use something else."
4,Good for the price,"I'm 6 foot and the handle angle is too low. Also, in heavy snow I've bent the handle. Has worked great for 3-4 winters. The wear strip is worn out and now I mainly use it on our wood deck. I've seen all metal scoops on the web and will order one next. Any suggestions on a all metal scoop?"
4,Close to perfect,"Exactly what I expected. Shiny stainless steel in a functional, fashionable pick. One fault--could be half an inch longer."
4,DE 520T,"This product is quality. I have been using it with my civic alarm for over 3 months now. I have had no issues thus far. Easy to hook up, quality product. The only confusing part is the power. When hooking up the wires your your alarm, you use the power wire from the battery. You do not join it with a separate power wire from the car. The alarm is powered by the car through the battery during normal operation. When the car power is lost, the battery continues to power the alarm module."
5,"Incredible! Hints of leather, amber and fresh wood. Sexy!","Probably one of the nicest, and most widely complimented fragrances I have ever burned. The best way I can describe this is a naturally woody scent with a light touch of amber and leather that is sexy and not overly perfumed or cloying. Slightly sweet and slightly musky. Super unique! The soy candle burned well and long and the fragrance lingered long after it was put out. Really excellent!"
3,Received Burlwood instead of Agave Sage,"Imagine my disapointment when I received a Burlwood candle instead of fresh smelling Agave Sage. Yes - it was from Amazon Warehouse - but it says Burlwood in big letters on the box and smells like wood. I'm keeping it for winter as it was on sale. C'mon Amazon Warehouse - this is the 3rd time where I''ve received something different than waht is listed. A different Lenox pattern, a different patternon a picture frame and now this. Get it together."
4,good,"you don't know my name was a pretty hot song. with a decent beat, and nice lyrics. so get this single if you love the song."
3,"Descent brass set, buy the milwaukee steel set for the same price","I got this set and I thought it would be better than it is. The case is a joke but the manufacturing of the guides is pretty good. Buy the milwaukee set for the same price, I saw it after I ordered this."
4,Excellent resource for travel along the silk route,"This book provides you with the essential resources for planning a trip along the silk route (via Moscow though, which is not orginally on the silk route !) and comes with tips, hotel address (some phone numbers are outdated though) and city plans. I have used it for planning my own trip."
2,An exercise in mediocrity,"Let me preface this review with my opinions of other films in the French ""Grue Wave,"" in order to provide context: I'm actually a fan of High Tension and its outlandish plot twist, while I find Martyrs and Inside to be merely revolting. In terms of Frontier(s), I found myself bored for the most part. It borrows so much from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre that I kept wanting to pop Chainsaw into the DVD player (the original, not the crummy remake). Throw in a bit of Hostel (the Achilles tendon is becoming popular in horror films these days), and you've basically got the entirety of Frontier(s) in a nutshell. There are some charmingly gruesome moments, and the cast is up to the task, but otherwise we're traveling in very mediocre territory. Not exactly a new frontier."
4,West in 1985 sounds great!,"Nice album, real nice album actually, it's got the heavy energy of the 70's Mountain, but with a mid 80's heavy rock guitar sound (like Jacksons thru overdrive pedals) and that mid 80's big drum sound.Choppy colour-filled riffs everywhere on here, the solos cut thru in the classic West fashion as well.If you have all his stuff from the studio days (Leslie West, Mountain, West Bruce and Laing, The Leslie West Band), then this is an enjoyable way to finish off the journey)."
5,Great Story,"I enjoyed the settings and the interwoven stories of the main characters. Having visited Pawely's Island before, it brought back fond memoeries of the area while entertaining me.I wished I could have spent so much time as Joanna did in that beach house!"
2,"Grammatically Well Written, But Stylistically Boring, And an Uninteresting Story","This book suffered from a severe case of overwriting. Too many adjectives and too many characters with too little development and a disjointed perspective.Like its characters, the book suffers from an identity crisis. It can't decide which story to tell so it jumps (in a joltingly obvious manner) from story to story. And, because it started jumping so early in the book, the connective tissue that usually makes a multi-perspective book flow was missing.I read the first half of the book before skipping ahead to the ending.The writing isn't bad, but the storyline was both obvious and schizophrenic. It wasn't a horrible book, but I could have lived having never read it."
4,Good grip but a funky feeling,"I got this because I was running low on chalk in my gym bag, and I wanted something that made a little less mess. I'm not a rock climber, I use it for weightlifting, mostly for deadlift. This does a really good job of giving the needed grip. It feels different but comparable to traditional chalk. It's a LOT less messy. While it makes a cloud of dust when you put it on, the dust does not make a visible mess. The big thing I don't like about it is that it is designed for someone like a rock climber who doesn't have the luxury of re-applying it constantly. It has some sort of anti-moisture agent that really dries out the hands and feels weird, even after you wash your hands a few times.J.Ja"
2,No Karaoke for us,"My daughter received this toy for Christmas. She loves the Disney princesses. The day she received it, she played with nothing else and didn't even talk to anyone or want to eat. She just wanted to play and sing along. The next day, the microphone plug broke. Surprise! No more karaoke! The quality is very poor and there aren't many song options. She really didn't care about that because she just wanted to sing along. Now the toy sits on the bottom of the toy box and I have used the batteries for other toys. What a big let down. Don't waste your money."
1,bad toy never get it,this is not a very nice toy its disks arent real ariel and belles voices have a little bit of attitudes all in all the pits!
2,Cheap Junk!,"My daughter LOVES the Disney Princesses, so this toy was selected as a Christmas gift. When we received it, the batteries were nearly dead, so we took it out to replace them with fresh ones before Xmas morning. Glad we did, because we were able to see the toy more closely and test it out. This toy is a flimsy piece of junk. Yes, sound quality is poor, but that's no surprise. What's worse is that for [money], you get cheap plastic pieces and easily breakable mechanics. There is no way this toy would have lasted more than a day in our house, even though my daughter is fairly cautious."
5,My 3 yr old gal loves this book!,"I found this book about 2 months ago, & have read it out to my then 34 mths old girl. She loves it when we read this story - it is easy/simple to understand the story, & my girl can identify herself in Joey's role! She will also point things out - Joey brushes his teeth, listened to stories, before he goes to sleep, & that Joey's mummy read the bible at bed-time (just like us)!I would recommend this book!"
4,wonderful novel,"This story is full of old new york imagery and captures the readers imagination immediately.I highly recommend the norton critical edition because the essays in the back were very helpful for further reading on Edith Wharton herself, the society in which she lived as well as other miscellaneous articles."
3,The Age of Innocence,"While radical for its time, this novel now seems somewhat superficial and dated. The main characters are more two-rather than three-dimensional. The international theme, the conflict between American and European values, is not well developed. Compared to a Henry James novel, such as The Ambassadors,that deals with the international theme, The Age of Innocence, functions on a lesser level."
3,A good book with a bad ending,"The Age of Innocence by Edith Wharton was a well-written book. The descriptions of New York society made the story jump off the pages. I also learned a bit of history through these in-depth details. Although Wharton does get a bit carried away at times, the detail brings the story alive.My favorite character was May Welland Archer. She showed a lot of character throughout the novel. Knowing what was going on between her husband, Newland Archer and her cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska, I felt a sense of pity for May. Although Newland remained faithful to May, his heart was not truly with him.I recommend this book to anyone who likes history, drama or romance, but I warn the reader that the ending is disappointing. After finishing the book, I asked myself what the purpose was of the novel. Due to an inconclusive ending, I felt sad and depressed after reading the last page. Although The Age of Innocence is a good book, the conclusion is disappointing."
1,Unreadable,A totally unreadable book that many critics think is the next best thing to sliced bread and a work of art for the ages; it is not.
3,Ok read. Did not like this one as much as other classics,did not like this as much as some other classics like ethan frome. read in high school reread now. cant say my opinion has changed much about this one.
2,Why?,"I am rading this book as a project for 10th grade lit comp gifted honors. To me, this is a difficult book to read. I chose it because the storyline seemed interesting, but the book is too bogged down with extra details that add nothing to the story. I find myself having to drudge through it just so I can write a paper on it. I would have put this book down and forgotten about it had i not had to finish it for my class. I cannot understand why anyone with a love for love would enjoy this book, which talkes out the romance and puts in the scientific poine of veiw. Why?"
3,Adequate Pillow Case,I bought this for Queen Size pillows and would prefer a longer pillow case. Otherwise it is fine.
1,Hollywood has a new detective... therein lies the Hitch.,"I give a book 100 pages or one day, which ever comes second, before I make the decision to give up or keep reading. I finished this book only because it took me less than a day to read. Hitchcock is barely detectable in the book, hardly the detecive as the cover implies. He does the hiring of the ex-cop main character and ""exposes"" the murderer at the end but not much else. As to the title, the connection to the film is barely noticable other than it being the film that Hitch is directing at the time. [....]"
3,misleading,"The book jacket is misleading. Alfred Hitchcock is a minor character in this stock, unimaginative novel that reads like it was dusted off from a fifties file of tired unsold movie plots. It seems odd too that the jacket boasts that this novel was approved by Universal and the Hitchcock estate. What this means is that Hitchcock is so blandly portrayed he's unrecognizable. Forget about the man's droll wit or legendary quotes, this Hitchcock is grim and colorless. Perhaps the author was legally hobbled in how he could depict Hitchcock but whatever the story, THE VERTIGO MURDERS is a missed opportunity all the way around."
2,Terrible design for modern bikes,"Two things:- you don't need to buy this if you get a ""road bike pod"" - it includes one- it's a horrible design that doesn't fit modern road bikes"
1,Sorry--I can't agree,It's too bad Gary didn't stick to photography and not try to be an author. He goes on the novice writing theory that if three sentences are good then four paragraphs will be better. I think one star is an extremely high rating for this book.
3,"Good Christie book, but not the best","This is the 9th c hristie book i've read. It came out in 1971, just four years before Christie's death in 1975. Miss Marple is given a vague assignment by a man she had encountered in the West Indies who has died. He seeks to have his wayward son cleared of a murder he doesn't think he committed. Miss Marple goes on the bus tour of gardens and houses in England designated by the dead man, and when the tourt gets to a certain town she is invited to stay at the house of three sisters. There are 2 old murders and one new one and of course Miss maple solves them all. The scenario nis very contrived and everything goes like clockwork, in typical Christie fashion. I read it with interest but it does not compare with the realy great Christie novels such as And Then There Were None and The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. But it was OK. ( )"
5,World-beat-psy-electroacoustica,"Celtic Cross: Simon Posford, Youth, and Soul Davies have outdone themselves with this release. By taking electronica and mixing it (successfully) with acoustic instruments ranging from the violin, to the guitar, oud, flute and various percussion instruments they've created a kind of world-beat techno-acoustica. Much of the music has a definite celtic flavor such as the violin driven techno of Darshanon. Well Ireland meets Algeria anyway, but other musical influences are also in the mix. There's a bit of Jamaican dub, eastern singing, acoustic guitar, flute etc., all integrated with psychedelic electronica. It's eclectic all right. On Hicksville, Celtic Cross weaves a dense rhythmic tapestry from disparate sources and takes you for an exotic flying carpet ride. I love the William Burroughs quote from which the first song Hicksville gets it's title: ""My god, are we EVER in Hicksville."""
5,Great album; bad Amazon,"As the other reviews state, this album is amazing. The only problem I have with buying this from Amazon is that after each song, an extra 2-4 seconds was added which are completely blank. The result is that, even though this album was obviously meant to flow from one song to the next, there is a gap between songs so I had to manually open each song in an audio editor and remove the offending segments. Another issue is that the fourth song ""Shwazz"" is incorrectly labeled as ""Shnazz"" which required more editing to fix. 5 stars for the album, 2 stars for Amazon."
5,"Deep, lucid coverage of statistical methods","Most statistics books are written for math wizardsand can hardly be understood by others. This bookexplains a number of statistical methods, such asfactor analysis, path analysis, and structuralequation models, and does so in ways that areclear, easy to grasp, and with fuly-workedexamples. I learned more about statistics fromthis one book than all the others I've readcombined."
5,A overlooked gem,Too many times these obscure albums suffer lots of underground hype without much reason. This album is both entertaining and experimental and certainly worth exploring!
5,"As with all her books, I was unable to put it down","If you read her dragons of pern series, the story is interwoven with characters that you have read about in other books, very captivating, and you can visualize yourself in the role of the main character. There is always a person in the book that the reader can identify with. One of those books that, when started, it is hard to put down"
2,"It was a Pern book, but not that good","I realy like Pern and all the books about it, but I feel that thred and the medeval atmosphere of the place realy defind the place and gave it the exitement and charm of the earler books. This book and the other later ones seem to be about solving all the problems Pern once had, making it a perfect world. This is unrealistic and ruens all the origanality the world once had. That is not to say I don't like the series, I love the first ones and the ones about Pern's past but this one is just not beliveble."
5,Great book!,"As usual, Anne McCaffrey captured my attention and the book was hard to put down. I am so sorry that we have lost this talented writer."
3,"lots of info on your wrist, if only you could read it","the sunnto observer provides a wealth of info for you outdoor adventures from a compass to a barometer even an altimeter, the only problem is it is difficult to read unless youre reading it from a specific angle, what you see on the picture is NOT how the display looks like when you have it on. other than that, it's a solid watch that should bring years of service, if only...."
4,A lot more reasonable across the pond,"Just got this from Amazon.co.uk for 4.24 new along with the Blu-Ray version of the film (The Italian Job - 40th Anniversary Edition [Blu-ray]) for 8.49 new with 4.07 for shipping making the total 16.80 which AMEX converted to be $28.40. Far less than what is being asked for here.As for the disc Mr. Cobb's review is spot on. Only true die hard fans of the movie will enjoy this album in its entirety. The best tracks (or most widely recognized) would have to be Matt Monro's On Days Like These (Track 1) and Getta Bloomin' Move On (Track 12). The rest of the tracks are the movie's filler/background music but without the action and dialogue of the movie, these tracks themselves just seem to fall a bit short.The whole disc is about 28 minutes long and if you're like me and buying this mostly for just those 2 great tracks, then spending $40 on it is hard to justify."
2,"I love them, but they are not quality","I received these bowls and only two of the plastic lids were sized right for the bowls, the bowls themselves are very thin aluminium and shipped with scratches and nicks. However, I have found a good use for every one of them so I can't complain too much."
2,Not what I thought.....Still an average wireless camera,"I bought this camera for the pan/tilt feature, but I found out that it does not work with well with Vista. I also thought the video would be as good as the TV-IP110W fixed wireless camera, but it is not. I am an IT guy and I have used several cameras and this is one of the worst I have ever used. I do wish Trendnet would get their act together and make a pan/tilt wireless with a high quality video sensor. Their other products are much better than this one. Buyer BEWARE...."
2,Barely tolerable- but usable if you must,"I bought this way back when it was $250. I wish I would have sprung the little extra for the DLink. But now I see it's only $120. Still borderline pricey for this clunky unit. Very difficult to get up and running. And VERY sluggish on the controls and video is sporadically laggy. I still use it a lot and deal with it, as I have a need for it and no money to upgrade. Bottom line- there are better so don't get this one."
5,Web camera,Excellent features and function. Reasonable image quality. Fully functional remotely using Active X.
5,Totally Brilliant,"This man is a musical genius. It is probably my favortie record of all time, and one should also check out his Strapping Young Lad and Ocean Machine (Amazing as well). All I can say is it is musical extasy and is well worth the cash."
3,"Where do all these people who love ""Another Thing Comin'"" come from?","I mean, Judas Priest's biggest hit (no wonder it's their biggest hit, it's also their worst song) is repetitive, lame, and boring as hell. The last 1.5 minutes of the song consist of the chorus repeated OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER... you get the point? Other than that, it's a great album,(especially Electric Eye) but that one stupid song pulls it down. I'm gonna buy Sad Wings of Destiny instead - and you should too!"
1,Thought I was buying a case,"Because the item description says ""16 roll per case"" I thought I was buying a case. It was only one roll. Very disappointed. Amazon refunded the purchase. I think the description needs to be changed."
1,Deceived,"The Bell Max Comfort Bicycle Seat is illustrated from a rear view showing spring like coils that would seemingly indicated shock absorbing springs. This would be consistent with the name Max Comfort. Instead the coils are only hard materials with virtually no shock absorbing ability. This picture was extremely deceiving to me. In ordering this seat, keep in mind that it is not max comfort at all but a very stiff and hard seat."
4,Different.,"I didn't have a clue what to expect when I picked up this album, so I wasn't suprised or dissappointed upon hearing it -extremely different, quite out there, trippy, mixed up, a sound collage definately. It's not bad -it's an interesting, intriguing listening experience- but it's far from your usual pop, rock or dance.."
4,Well done,"This is a great book for anyone looking to understand how to look at a goat, or any livestock for that matter.Only 4 stars because books needs updating to coincide with ADGA scorecard changes."
5,"GREAT MUSIC, GREAT CARTOONS, GREAT IDEA!","WE LOVE DISNEY'S LITTLE EINSTEINS, AND THIS CD DEFINITELY ROCKS!, IT'S TRULY AN ORIGINAL CONCEPT!, JUST LIKE VIEWING ONE OF THEIR DVDS' BUT INSTEAD YOU LISTEN TO THEM!, GREAT BUY!, HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!"
4,"never been to brazil, but this sure does feel like brazil",after hearing 'me libertei' for the first time i practically flipped out. the song is so freakin funky that i had it on repeat like 15 times. i didn't need or want to translate the brazilian portuguese. the melody speaks for itself. the rest of the album is decent 70's brazilian pop-funk music but i truly do hope 'me libertei' has the same effect on you like it still does for me.
2,Subtitles missing,Many of the subtitles were either missing and or would stop in mid sentence. DVD was shipped and received quickly.
2,Disappointing,"I recently purchased an MP3 jukebox, and the slight tinniness of the included headphone set led me to seek a product of better quality. I did not find it in the Koss R-80. This set exhibits a sharp db drop-off in both high and low frequencies, and what I can only describe as 'mushiness' in the mid-range. I did not find the set to be as uncomfortable to wear as other reviewers have noted, and the cushioning is effective at blocking exterior noise. However, this does not compensate for the poor audio quality. After an hour of listening to the R-80, I returned with relief and new appreciation to my original inexpensive set."
3,OK for the price,"I've had these headphones for over 1.5 years. I bought them from Amazon too. They just broke on me (although they still work). The part that connects the headband part to the speakers just broke as I was putting them on. It is something that could probably be fixed with superglue, but I'm just going to buy some better headphones. I was quite pleased when I got them, but after about 3 months of having them - I guess I played them too loud or something because there has been a rattle in them from time to time since then when the bass is turned up at all. I have used them almost daily since I got them and the covering over the foam padding that goes around the ear has been slowly coming off for 6 months - and all I do is put them over my ears and take them off.If you've got more cash, I say buy some other pair of headphones."
5,Impressive Clarity for the Money,"I recently bought a pair of UR20s at Best-Buy. For $20, I am very impressed: sound and durability are beyond my expectations. They flex easily and though I have a big head, these are comfortable for long periods of time. They are pretty big, so don't expect to bring them with if you have a small bag. Some say the sound is ""flat"", but these are studio monitors, they are not designed to be the ""best"" sounding, rather ""accurate"" sounding. Plus, you can mess with your EQ settings to get your desired sound. Again, these are very impressive. I've listened to a variety of music from Daft Punk to The Hunger Games Score and continue to grow on these, preferring them over ear-buds and other brands more and more. Turn your music up and revel in the clarity. Just remember they are $20, not $350 like Beats, Bose,etc."
5,"Great Value, very comfortable","A great full range, comfortable pair of headphones for under $20 you can't beat it. I bought my second pair for work to connect to my computer. Blocks out sounds, so I either listen to tunes, or just leave them on to block out the over the cube noise."
1,Not what I expected,"I had the Koss UR55 in the past, so I figured that these would be a cheaper alternative. I assumed that the sound quality wouldn't be as good, but I wasn't expecting it to be this bad. it has an underwater sound like nothing I have heard. They are, however, really comfortable. Basically, these are earmuffs. I bought a pair of UR55s for $10 more, I will update when they arrive."
1,Awful purchase - broke fast,"I am a fan of Koss, so when buying headphones I considered no other brand. The sound quality in the UR-20 is good, but they did not last more than 45 minutes of use: when adjusting them to my head one of the ear cups came off. In trying to get it back in, the sound cable ruptured, rendering the headphones useless. After 45 minutes. The price was low, so I won't bother to return them to Amazon, but wanted to register the disappointment and the warning here."
3,They Are Ok,"I had some coby headphones around the same price as these, and I prefer thoes coby ones over these, sadly.....the coby ones I didnt have to tune my computers equalizer to make them sound right, these I do and I shouldnt have to. Unless this is user error, I dont think I need to tune my comp to sound right.....however on a plus for these, they are very comfortable to wear, and they are BIG headphones, also the bass is pretty, good. After all I guess you get what you pay for. I wish I didnt have to edit the sound, it sounds like im outside of a techno club listening through a wall, the sound doenst sound like im right there so to speak. I had to tune the 16khz up pretty much and the 1, 2, 4, and 8 up a bit, to make it sound right. The lower end just a touch for a tad more bass. Other then that theres my review 3 stars."
2,sent them right back,"These headphones are HUGE. Even w/the band at it's smallest setting they droop down past my ears. Despite being included in my search for ""collapsible headphones"" these do NOT fold up."
2,Not for the long haul,"The Koss R-80 headphones have great sound and eliminate most external noise.They're also reasonably comfortable. But if you're looking for headphones thatwill last a long time, keep looking. The earpieces attach to the headband withplastic connectors that weaken and snap after a relatively brief time period,leaving the earpiece dangling by a thin wire. My set broke under warranty,and were replaced without a hassle, but the new ones died the same death.Really a shame."
1,False Billing,"Come on, how can any album call itself ""Best Rock Anthems...Ever"" and leave off ""Stairway to Heaven"" and ""Freebird""? This is like a Sports Announcer at the Olympics telling you who won the Bronze Medal and who finished 4th, 5th, 6th, etc. but not telling you who won the Gold and Silver."
4,Helpful Book,Small book and you can carry it in your purse with you. Nice to have something to make it simple too. Not complicated to understand.
4,Excellent HRM and stop watch - pc link is ok but should be updated to USB,"This is an excellent heart rate monitor with the standard features (max, min alarms, time in and out of zone etc...) its also an excellent stop watch. I download the data using Suunto's Activity Monitor software - which allows you to export the data to Excel! Plotting HR versus altitude is very useful for training.I only have a few minor complaints: (1) Battery life is terrible - this thing (and the chest strap) eat up 4 batteries a year. (2) When battery life starts to fade interference is a big issue - fortunately the data can be edited so you can remove ""spikes"". (3) PC interface is serial cable - should be USB. (4) Suunto software is veru buggy and crashes all the time (no data lost fortunately)"
2,"If you think it's a tough watch, think again","I wear my X6HR in a regular environment (office, home), nothing near extreme condition. However, in less than a year, I foung the rubber band of the heart monitor is broken in many placed and the rubber became brittle with many hairline cracks. This is clearly a quality issue with the material used for the watch. In a trip to the Keys, FL, I found that the little rubber ring that holds the band of the watch in place broke in two piece much like what happed to the heart rate monitor band. The band itself also has many small cracks. I am sure the band will break in half sooner or later. The LCD on the watch also became fuzzy when I wear it around beaches. This is supposed to be a watch that you can bring to an expedition, yet it failed miserably in a everyday environment. If you are looking for a tough watch, look elsewhere. My Casio G-shock never gives me any headache that this watch gives."
5,A Most Excellent Read,"This is one good book. The authors have synergized excellent science fiction with the groundbreaking work on 'killology', or the study of killing, that Grossman presents in his seminal work 'On Killing'. They have done an incredible job rolling up many of the most telling points from 'On Killing' (as well as from Dr. Alexis Artwohl and Bruce Siddle's work on the impacts of deadly force application) into the fabric of a rollicking good yarn worthy of Patrick O'Brian's best. Very reminiscent of Heinlein and Haldeman in that regard, which from me at least is high praise indeed. Good stuff on all fronts."
3,warning for total baja-ers,"While this seems like a really great resource for those wishing to stay within the 70 mile zone between the border, TJ, Rosarito and Ensenada there is little (actually nothing) about the rest of the peninsula. If you're interested in life south of the Bufadora, I'm afraid you'll have to look again."
5,Wonderful Series,"I remember watching these three episodes on tv several years ago and enjoyed them very much. I really like watching Amanda Burton's characters, she's a wonderful actress. If you're a fan of her work, you won't be disappointed. Viewing these episodes now brought back memories and still kept me on the edge of my seat."
2,Garbage Around Jupiter,"Another failed Heart album. Will they stop trying to be hard rock already? Ann Wilson's vocals have torpedoed downhill and Nancy's voice actually made my cat go into the other room.This release would have been better cut back to an Maxi-EP, featuring the 4 good songs on the CD, and the bonus tracks.I'm hoping they put on a better live performance of these songs than the studio versions. We'll see. Don't waste your money, get someone to burn this cd for you, and then after listening to it, use the cd as a table coaster."
3,A little too long.,"Heart ""Jupiters Darling"" #94 (2004).11 years had past since Heart had released any new material. The band consisted of Ann and Nancy Wilson, bassist Mike Inez from Alice In Chains, Ben Smith on drums, keyboardist Darian Sahanaja and guitarist Craig Bartock. On this their 11th studio album, you get some keepers in, the harmonica driven ""Down The Nile"", the rockin' ""Oldest Story In the World"", the fun tune ""Things', ""Move On"", has that Alice In Chains feel to it, the sizzlin' ""Vainglorious"", and you guessed it, a Led Zeppelin tribute ""Led To One"". This album was just a tad long, not as good as in their prime. They would release ""Red Velvet Car"", in 2010."
2,They've Done FAR Better...,"All I can say is that this new cd isn't all that great. As a matter of fact, it's rather poor. I've listened to it a few times and I just can't get into it like new cd's that I own. I play a lot of other cd's over and over while Heart's isn't played any longer. Truth be told, I've shelved the thing. People who see Ann and Nancy as gods who can do no wrong will love it and that's fine. I guess I'm not much of a fan anymore. I hope all the rest who buy this cd find things they like.And I'm hoping that someday they will make a followup that will have stronger material. This sure isn't it."
4,"Refreshing storyline, engaging interaction of characters","We saw this movie in the theatres, purchased the VHS video, and are now purchasing the DVD. Sean Connery is a favorite actor of mine and I enjoyed the jungle setting, interesting storyline, and interaction between the two main characters.Could it have been done better? Yes.Does that prevent me from liking this movie? Absolutely not."
3,Nice map of limited use,A nice map for driving around the area. I ended up not using it at all on location as we were not driving. Just for orientation there are Google Maps and some free maps also available locally. However my major complains are 1) paper it is made from; you fold the map a few times and it tears up; up to the point that you cannot really use it on the road without breaking it. 2) total waste of the other side of the map - it is empty. The best use of that map is to put it on the wall as a souvenir. Keep in mind that is not a hiking map. They have another product for hiking.
4,The Sayings of Muhammad,"This book has many of the Prophet Muhammad's saying in an easy-to-read style. The sayings are organized by subject matter which is helpful when trying to understand His point of view on particular issues. The true beauty of Islam is readily revealed in this book. Books such as this are very helpful in understanding the daily application of Islamic religious principles. The prophet's championship of women, compassion for the poor and the suffering, his loving and tolerant nature, and his innate passion for Truth come through loud and clear in this book of short and sweet sayings."
2,Book was Used but waas posted as NEW,"Book was written in and I thought the seller was seliing a NEW book, but it was clearly USED very disappointed."
1,Description of book was not adequate,I was looking for a book I read years ago. This was not the book I was looking for. The vendor's description was not adequate so I took a chance based on the titie and got it wrong.
4,Attractive Hamper,"I chose this hamper mainly because it didn't scream ""baby"". I've been using it a little over a year now for my son and it's worked well. Quite a bit of baby/toddler clothes can fit into it. My only issue is that the internal mesh linder has ripped a bit at the seams. That could be my fault however, because, well, sometimes I just pack the clothes in there.Nice, affordable hamper."
5,PERFECT!,"It's the perfect size, not too big, and the removable netted insert makes it easy to take his clothes to the washer.I highly recomment this to all moms! It could also carry though to adulthood!"
4,Life in the Treetops,"Margaret Lowman's story, Life in the Treetops, is an inspiration for young women considering a life in science. She tells how she balanced a career as a field biologist, studying the forest canopy, with being a wife and mother, and eventually a single parent. Her stories of her experiences as a researcher and tree climber in such exotic locals as the Australian outback, Cameroon, Belize and Panama are intermingled with her observations about the inhabitants of these locals, the people she worked with and her sons. Her perseverance in a field dominated by men has given her an interesting perspective about science and life in general."
1,Borderline unreadable for the layman,"This summary of the nineteenth century Habsburg empire is poorly organized, repetitious, glib and judgemental. The basic weaknesses of the Empire are identified, as is its place in the 19th century balance of power. But the work lacks a satisfactory narrative of events and assumes too much prior knowledge of the reader. This work may offer useful insights and interpretation to the expert, but is painful for the rest of us."
5,Great Chicago skates,"I am a 71 yrs young female. I purchased these ""Men's"" skates for myself. I bought a size larger and they are very comfortable. As an older ""re"" learner these skates worked out just great. The wheel's don't have speed, which is what I was looking for. They are indoor // outdoor skates. They work better for inside skating. A great price and a great quality skate. Especially for a beginner (the Wheels). No matter what age you are, these skates are the best. I love these skates."
5,Excellent Book,Steve is wise beyond his years. When I started reading his book I thought he was much older than he is. You really feel the joy and the pain ...he shares what most of us go through in life but never put into words. I finished the book and turned to the first page and started reading it again.
4,ALMOST everything you want to know and entertaining,"What a great book to pick up and open to any section and find out answers to questions we have all had at times. A bit dry at times but also humorous, and I leave even more fascinated by air travel than when I picked it up."
5,Ever fly? Read it!,"This book should be in the back seatpockets of every airplane. It answers just about every question (and fear) you ever have about flying in a clear and easy to understand way.The subtitle ""everything you need to know about air travel"" is true - there are chapters where the author diverts to talk about terrorism and even spends an entire chapter detailing the color scheme and theme for every major US airline and continues to grade them!I bought this for my fiance to read since she's terribly afraid of flying (even though she does it often) and thought it might make her grab the armrests with a bit less force during the flight.My only negative about this book is that the author doesn't really go into detail about his own background - he mentions at times various flights and planes he's flown on, but we get the impression he was mainly a cargo pilot and not a passenger airline pilot - but I'm still not sure.Either way, what a great read. Take it on your next flight."
5,For the curious and nervous,"I'm a VERY frequent traveler, and it's hard to spend as much time on planes as I do without picking up some knowledge of air travel. I sometimes find myself rattling off facts and info to fellow passengers who subsequently ask if I work for the airline (which I don't). But even with the knowledge I've absorbed as a frequent flier over the years, I still have many questions (and actually the number of questions I have about various things seems to only increase with the amount of time I spend on planes). Ask the Pilot was a very informative and entertaining read that answered a lot of my questions, and then some. It is a good book for the curious traveler, and even though I'm not a nervous traveler I would venture to say that it would help calm some of a nervous traveler's anxiety, as well."
5,THIS CD ROCKS,"Basically limp biscut, except your not hearing the same thing over and over again. Plus, they don't feel the need to use curses to get their point across."
4,For Don't let go at least,"Volume 2 is more or less like volume 1 : why did they choose those songs especifically? The good surprises are Don't let go [12:50] by Isaac Hayes and Walk away [8:30] by Donna Summer. The first one is the original 12"" version unavailable elsewhere on cd and the second is a longer mix than the original 7:15 12"" version. Another good surprises are Hot butterfly [8:20] by Bionic Boogie and Let's go all the way down [7:15] by Brenda and the Tabulations in a mix untitled Breakdown edit (a latter one, not the original 1977 lp mix). But why Fire island, a 1977 Village People song? Anyway, some rarities on cd make this compilation worth the purchase."
3,Gannon/Brooks 2-pace,The only reason I would rate this pack so low is because of the 2 players included. But I enjoy collecting these things so I bought it anyways.
5,Leap Frog Learning,This is a great learning product. But be advised that you must have the learnig center. The other problem is that Leap Frog doesn't show this player anymore. They a re pushing Little Leaps. The center isn't evenb sold in me local/area stores.
5,Perfect Peace Praise and Worship Video,"Originally produced by Moody Institute of Science.The video is incredible, especially the kayaker going down the rushing white water.Beautiful songs, though a bit dated, still a wonderful visual devotional for Christians using Maranantha Music. Have owned it for 16 years and still love to watch it. For your teens, the kayaker can be a great image of God's ""perfect peace"" even in the midst of turmoil. Use it in worship or Bible studies to illustrate!"
5,Love it!!,I always purchase my replacement filters for my humidifier from here. They fit perfectly and are way cheaper than purchasing from the store! Please keep selling!!
3,"Wrong size, but still OK","This product was actually the wrong item for my humidifier. It leaves a 1/2 inch gap inside. However, it does work."
3,Bait and Switched on me too,I received BestAir instead of Essick. The price is good but I won't know how well the filters will hold up for a while. Change your wording please.
5,Smooth Order,The filters were as advertised and came promptly. No complaints at all. No more dry air. I appreciate the service.
2,very disappointed,"I bought this for my son for xmas. I was very dissappointed in it. Usually I love First Act instruments. But this one was seriously out of tune when we opened the package. After trying to tune it myself with their tool I took it to my local music store for them to tune. No matter what she did the instrument wouldn't stay in tune. She finally gave up trying to tune it to the notes they said it was supposed to be tuned to and just generally tuned it so at least it was in tune to itself. By the next day it was out of tune yet again. I was really disappointed and have since started looking for a better quality lap harp..which in case you decided to look else where, is also called a hog nosed psaltery."
3,Not worth the extra cost,"I have been using Source Naturals Essential Enzymes for years. When I saw this, I decided to try it since it seemed to be a step up from their Essential Enzymes. After a month of DigestActiv, I switched back to Essential Enzymes."
4,sun hat,fits nice. clean design. brim on hat could be a bit longer and wider but otherwise a nice all around sun protection device
4,Not was I expected,"This is my first Amanda Ashley novel. I normally don't care for stories set in older times but I love vampire novels so I thought I would give it a try. I'm glad I did. It's a very good romance. It could use a little more depth to the story but a good read. She does very well with description, giving enough to set you in the room without overpowering the story. I will definitely be trying more of her books."
2,This is not a good trimmer,"It's LOUD, hair gets stuck in it and won't come out, it catches on the hair and pulls, it does not do a good job trimming. If you are looking for a trimmer I don't recommend this one."
4,Marples 4,continuing in the grand Agatha Christie fashion these are not to be missedby anyone loving the murder mysteries! Very well done - will not disappoint!
1,Stop re-writing Christie,"I am so very disappointed by this last season. Some episodes are only vague shadows of the original stories. Quite underwhelmed by the portrayal Miss Marple as well. Too aggressive, too detective-ish. I never took that away from any of her stories. Christie's work is so good - why do people feel a need to change it so much in translation to screen? The worst is ""Why Didn't They Ask Evans?"" Miss Marple is not even IN the original. If you take this as just a mystery series, it is fair entertainment."
1,Unwatchable,"This series is unwatchable!!! It appears to have been filmed and directed by a novice...it hasnauseating film angles, muttled plots, an abundence of blurred close ups and just plain bad direction.I was unable to finish the series. Julia McKenzie is not Miss M at all!! Her expression is one of a cocker spaniel rather then a sharp witted sleuthI was expecting a Poirot or Sherlock Holms type ofBBC production. Don't waste your money or your time What were they thinking or not!"
1,"Have not yet seen,......but","I have just started to enjoy Marple and to have her changed is a real disappointment. I was really looking forward to series 4. After reading the reviews I don't think I will be purchasing the new Marple. I did purchase the series 4 of Poirot and I did enjoy it but was very disappointed not to see Japp or Hastins, not having them in the movies seem to have taken something away. Why was Marple replaced? She was great!! (McEwan)"
2,Extremely difficult to use,"I chose this because it could be used with a newborn and it offers several carrying positions. It worked well when my daughter was first born and very small, but now at two months, when she's bigger and more active it's impossible to get her into it. Since it's already tied to you, you can't see what you're doing and the baby can get tangled in all the weird knots and folds."
2,Not for us - too much trouble putting on and taking off,We loved the concept of this but it wasn't for us. Neither my wife not I--and especially not our baby :)--had the patience to take the time needed to learn how to wrap this correctly and efficiently. We recently got together with several other couples of new babies and other parents had the same comment. Baby bjorn was the hands-down favorite for carrying baby.
2,"Thought it would be great, but not so much","I bought this since other Mom's I know raved about it. First I paid $50 for what is basicly a HUGE piece of heavy fabric. You then have to practive wrapping this thing around you. It takes time to learn how to wrap it properly. If you want to go any where in public with this thing on you better put it on before you leave the house since you will never figure it out once you are away from a mirror. My daughter cried EVERY time I put her in this. She didn't like it at all. The two times I did get her to calm down and stay in it she got over heated quickly even though she was just wearing a onesie. This material is so thick and having that on the baby plus your body heat and your baby will be cooking! I gave up and returned it and so did some of the ladies I know after they had the same issue. Great idea, but huge fail. Not to mention if you really want to try this buy some fabric and wrap it around yourself for less then half the cost."
4,Comfortable Carrier,My son really liked this as a newborn and I liked how it didn't kill my back like all the other carriers did. It can be a little difficult to put on and I often have trouble getting it tight enough but overall I think it's great. My baby is four months now and doesn't seem to like it much anymore but that could just be him.
4,"Great product, takes some practice","My wife and I really enjoy this wrap. Once you get it on properly it is very comfortable, and usually puts our 3 month old to sleep right away. We have a local hockey/ice arena that allows people to walk laps during the cold winter months, and I have never had a problem keeping her warm because she shares my body heat.If I had a complaint, it would be that it is somewhat complicated to wrap and tie, and generally requires some help to keep it from getting on the floor. This isn't a big deal in our house, but in public it can be difficult to keep the fabric from getting on the ground. That being said, its just something that takes a little practice, and the more we use it, the better we get at it. The fact that it is more versatile, and much more comfortable than the Baby Bjorn far outweighs the minor inconvenience factor.I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a baby carrier."
3,Not useful for longer periods of time,"This is a handy tool for those late nights when your newborn can't fall asleep and your arms start to get tired from walking the little one round and round. Or a stroll around the neighborhood to help you get some exercise and baby to doze off. Over time and/or long distances the binding starts to get loose and your baby will start to slide downwards. There's really no way around this because the cotton is brushed very smooth, so even the tightest of knots will start to come undone after a while. If you're going for a longer walk or are travelling and need something that will hold up during a day trip or longer outing, this is incredibly cumbersome. If I use this for longer than a half hour/forty minutes, I have to stop, readjust baby, and tighten the binding every ten to fifteen minutes. I ended up buying a second, sturdier baby carrier. If you've got a limited budget, just get something sturdy from the start."
2,Moby Wrap not for every baby!,"My first suggestion: Keep packaging and all receipts until you know you AND your baby will like it!I heard many great things about the Moby wrap and really wanted to love it! Unfortunately my daughter wanted nothing to do with the cramped quarters and the way it forced her head down as a newborn. She has held her head up since day 2 and is quite the wiggle worm! It was just too constricting for her.Also, I don't think the Moby is practical anywhere but at home. The fabric is incredibly long and I'm not sure there is a way to put it on without some of it dragging on the ground. There is also so much fabric that it is like wearing another piece of clothing which is anything but ideal in the South during the summer months!We are currently using the Bjorn classic carrier which she has loved since day one but are in the researching stages of finding something more comfortable for my back."
4,Moby Wrap,"The Moby Wrap is great if you can get your baby in it. It can be quite cumbersome at times, especially if your little one is already squirmy. It is helpful to get some things done around the house, but gets hot wearing it for lengths at a time (especially during the summer in Phoenix). Overall happy with it."
3,Great for a few months only,"I really wanted to like this item. It looked nice on other moms. I enjoyed it for a few months when my baby was born but after she was 6 months old, it was just hard to fit her in the Moby. Also, with a more mobile baby, it's hard to put the thing together and then get my daughter in it. So I would say I love it for the first few months, and then it is not very useful. It seems a bit expensive to buy for a few months. I would probably just try to make it myself if I had to do it again."
4,"Good wrap, very secure","I got this when my son was 2 wks old and wanted to be held all the time. After studying the instructions I got the hang of wrapping it and it is really easy. I always feel like he is nice and secure in there, which was something I was initially apprehensive about. I only gave it 4 stars b/c it can get hot for both of us. I recently bought the mesh Bjorn for this reason, but I'm still hanging onto my wrap. I would recommend it."
5,Moby Wrap,It came super fast! It is a gift to my daughter. She had a bit of difficulty knowing how to wrap it around herself and put baby in.She loves it.
1,frustrating beyond belief,"I am so disappointed in this ridiculously long piece of fabric. It is soft and the sand color is pretty, but thats it! It drags on the floor and you have to spend time adjusting it so it isnt tangled.I still cant get it to crisscross properly w/out the front hanging all over the place. I am not happy and would never recommend it. There are less complicated wraps out there I will try. Waste of $$$!!"
2,Good quality but not made for small people,"I bought a Moby Wrap after much research about babywearing and slings. The product is very good quality and I really wanted it to work but it really isn't made for small people. I'm barely 5 ft. tall and about 100 lbs. and it just didn't work. The fabric is overwhelming and I could never get it to wrap like in the photos or online videos. The large amount of fabric totally enveloped me and not in a good way. I'm sure this is a great product for more average sized people, but I recommend that petite moms get a more traditional sling rather than a wrap-style one."
4,I love it! Great purchase!,This is my 5th baby carrier out of 3 children. I love how versatile the Moby wrap is. You do have to get it on before going out because it is not practical to slip on in the grocery store parking lot (it's too long). It was easy for me to get the hang of and my baby loves being in it. I will say I wish I had bought it sooner because my baby is going on 18lbs and is getting a little heavy to tote around all day long. It distributes the weight very well but I guess it can't make her any lighter.
2,Great idea but...,This was exactly what I was looking for. It is a great idea but it was too much material.I really tried hard to make this wrap work but it was quite difficult putting the baby into the wrap. She was practically dangling from my arms as I tried to fit one leg in and then the next...I just gave up and sent this back.
3,Moby Wrap Review,"Pros: Lightweight, the black color goes with pretty much any outfit I wear. It keeps baby and I very warm. It looks a lot nicer than one of those carriers that you just put on and set the baby in. It is all one piece. Easy to wash and dry.Cons: On a warmer day, it is so unbearably hot to wear. My 4 1/2 month old likes to look around and would like to be facing the other direction. Because of this, he is always leaning heavily to one side, and it feels like he is going to fall out. It is very hard to use this for a newborn because his head is leaning way down in it on an awkward angle. You can only take the baby in and out of it a few times before you have to re-tie the whole thing.Overall: I think I would have found a similar one-piece design that has better capabilities for holding the infant, and one in which I could place the child facing the other direction."
5,easy to wear and use,I found the Moby easy to use. The instructions are step-by-step photos that are extremely easy to follow. The wrap is comfortable to wear. My baby loves it. I only wish I had bought it sooner.
2,Not a fan,"I can totally see the benefit of using this and the material is great and very soft, however, I did not enjoy this so much. Lots of fabric to wrap around and I'm not the most patient which is probably why this didn't work for me. I also had a very small baby so she slipped right through, I was worried about suffocation risks so I took her out. Another thing to consider is when you've got a screaming newborn, do you really want to be fussing over all this fabric? I ended up buying the baby hawk and it worked great for us."
1,Way too confusing,"This thing is so long and is not user friendly. It is frustrating when trying to get things in order out in public and trying to deal with this VERY long chunk of fabric. When the ground is wet and the fabric is draped all over it, it doesn't go well. Would NOT recommend to anyone!"
4,good product,"it's much cuter than a regular baby carrier. works well once you have it on right, but is somewhat of an art getting it on. i like it alot though."
3,Indigo Color is Actually Chambray/Denim Blue,"The only thing I'm reviewing is the color of the Indigo moby wrap. I ordered it expecting a sky blue like the photo, but it's more of a denim blue or chambray color. I am REALLY disappointed and plan to return it. It's just so aggravating considering now I have to wait a minimum of 2 more days wrangling an 18 month old and a newborn to get one in hand. Argh!"
2,i think its a good fit but but,"Althought it has many way of adjusting to the baby, but with the current heat its immpossible using this wrap for the baby! The wrape is so long that it required many technical wrap around your body to find a good fit and once its in place there is not much adjustment you can do! The baby will have to be in there without much wiggle room. I end up returning it."
3,lots of wrapping.. baby doesn't like it,"wife doesn't either... too much wrapping, baby bjorn here we come. . . . . . . . . ."
2,"Cute, but inconvenient.","I had some back issues after birth, so wearing this wrap did not feel good to me. It was also hot and took so much to wrap and unwrap everytime.Cute, but inconvenient."
3,"Worked good for NB, but not for bigger baby.","Moby wrap worked well when my baby was NB. It kept her close to my chest and I could cover her face with the fabric to protect her from the sun while she slept. However, it was pain in the butt to take her in and out during the doctor's visit. I now use Ergo."
2,Jeeves attempts to operate without Bertie.,"This is one of P.G. Wodehouses lesser efforts. The books plods rather than races along. All the other Jeeves books are written from the point of view of Bertie Wooster, but with Bertie gone this tactic cannot be used and the book suffers as a consequence. Only get it if you are making a collection of Wodehouse. Two other points. Firstly, the character in the novel is the Earl of Rowcester (not Towcester) and secondly the book was previously published as 'Ring for Jeeves'"
5,Indispensable guide for families,"This is an incredibly detailed book that has a huge amount of information on what to do, see, and avoid in Vegas if you are traveling with children. The section on which restaurants and buffets to eat at for families that are on a budget is more than worth the price of this book. This book, along with ""The Unofficial Guide to Las Vegas"" by Bob Sehlinger will make planning your trip to Vegas fun and informative. Both are highly recommended!!"
4,Nice variety,"I was impressed by the variety in these stories. Some of them are only meant to be light entertainment, but others like ""Jack Be Quick"" and ""The Favor"" really get to you. I especially liked ""Scat"" -- which uses the title word in four different meanings."
5,Great series!,What can I say? I just really love this series. I found Jake quite by accident on a bargain table and took a chance. This was really serendipity. I promptly bought all that were written and have kept up ever since. I am eagerly awaiting # 8 as I have gotten involved with these characters. MEMLINE
5,Hard to believe this album is 40 (+) years old...,"...but it is. And it sounds great. And Kenny Rogers looked great. So did Mike Settle and the rest of the First Edition. The title song, ""Ruby, Don't Take Your Love To Town"" is a classic, as is ""Me and Bobby McGee,"" which sounds wonderful no matter who performs it. And ""Reuben James"" too. Barely 25 minutes in length, the album is a showcase to launch the fabulous solo career of Mr. Rogers."
3,"A little Complicated, but interesting","I read both the books in the duology. West has a writing style that is a little hard to read sometimes, but I thought the story was compelling. I finished the book wondering who all the charaters were (Evayne, Kallandras, etc.) and what happened in their past. I'd like to see her write something specifically about the other characters that she introduced in the story, something that would answer all the questions. If she does can so this effectively, I'd call it a good series. If the mysteries are NEVER revealed, I'd call it a mediocre one. The ending (of the series) was NOT what I expected."
3,Fame,"Yes, I know this is an old movie and I remembered liking the lead song. Story line was weak. I was expecting more."
3,Sound Track CD included,This Newly released version includes the CD soundtrack! The 2-disc set does NOT have 2 DVD's - just one DVD of the movie. If you think you are getting more movie cuts or something - you aren't. Don't order the CD separately.
4,great but disturbing in somse scenes,"I have children in the performing arts - and I wanted them to to get a taste of the ""reality"" of a full-time school and the harshness of competition in such schools. The movie was great for that - but some of the R-rated scenes were even hard on me. I do not know if I will watch the movie again soon. As a presentation of 'what it's like' to enter one of these firecely competitive schools, it was very good; and as a sober revealer of how much anger, disappointment and immorality there is in such a society, it was great. It was a much ROUGHER version of ""STEP UP"" (the movie). For parents considering putting their kids into performing arts high schools - it's probably informative, and not too far off. I would rate it PG-17 to R for language and sexual insinuations."
3,"Rex Krebs, when will you learn","I've read a lot of true crime books, and i have to say this one disapponted me a little. When the book first started it was good, well written, and exciting. towards the middle when they start to explain about Rex's famiy life and background I got a little confused how they were going back and forth, but once you get back that part the book picks up again. I haven't finished the book yet because I got disappointed with it, I only have 2 chapters left which would most likely just make me lazy, instead of just disappointed."
3,Dead and Buried,Lots of redundancy. Long and drawnout. Interesting information and I would consider the book a filler book. When you have nothing else to read.
3,"A good starter book, but lacks details","I agree with most of the other reviewers. If I were opening a coffee cart or kiosk I'd find this book educational. As it is, it lacks details but does give good basic information. You can start here but ""Become a coffee house owner"" is far more detailed, with business plans, budgets, specific list of items needed (down to the grease trap), contacts, employees, probably health requirements etc. I did gain some knowledge from this book, but it won't be a point of referral in the future."
2,Wouldn't restore a camaro with it,I am restoring a 67 Camaro now and have not found the book of any use in the restoration process. A good assembly manual beats a book with a bunch of glossy pictures and poorly written text. Don't waste your money.
3,missed the beat,"gave these to my six year old, but didn't sit down and show him how it worked. the drum sticks ended up on the floor of the play room. i think we missed the beat. moral of the story is, if you don't have time to sit and learn w/ child, product isn't self-explanitory."
3,Disappointing history from an aging scholar,"Considering the academic accomplishments of Robert Remini, this short (and index-less) biography of Joseph Smith is a disappointment--unevenly written, uncritical, even nave. Remini seems out of his element when discussing nineteenth-century religion, and his several attempts to relate Smith to his specialty, the Jacksonian era, are strained. Laudable gestures of human kindness performed by a number of LDS scholars noted in the preface seem to have paid remarkable dividends in the tender treatment that the Mormon prophet received from the aging scholar. A reader would not even learn that Smith's major grievance against the Nauvoo Expositor (which he had destroyed) was that it revealed his practice of polygamy-a practice he had publicly denied only a few days previous."
3,Reads Almost like a Classic Adventure Novel!,"""Tasting Pleasure"" is the wonderful story of a girl who combined the proverbial reporter's pad and pencil, youthful curiosity and zest for life, with a talented and trainable palette, to mold for herself an internationally recognised career and the post as the undisputed Queen of Wine. The story itself is a rather exciting one and takes the reader from Robinson's native London to the great winemaking houses of France, to the wine revolution in Mondavi's California to the established houses of Australia.The truly wonderful aspect of this book is the rather long list of vintages and tastings that the author recants the stories of, most notably the wonderful story of her tasting of a bottle of wine from the cellar of none other than Thomas Jefferson.Tasting pleaseure is a wonderful story of a woman's quick wit and creativity that brought about a truly amazing career and international recognition. Highly recommended."
4,Entry level,"A nice entry point as far as digital camcorders go. If your not too high tech or your other equipment is not top of the line, you probably won't be able to tell much difference between this and the next model above it."
3,good for TV output but bad for PC,"The quality of TV output is very good but poor when transported to PC. There seems to be data loss. Perhaps due to USB streaming, not sure. Other things are fine."
2,DONT BUY IF USED FOR FIREWIRE EDITING,"Basically, this camera is great, but I bought it to do digital editing (so I would transfer the video with the firewire port). Well, to my surprise, Adobe Premiere didn't support the camera, Ulead's VideoStudio didn't either, and neither did the software provided with it (Pixelas ImageMixer). All in all, the firewire is really just a buzzword to make the camera sell, because its ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS. So I'm stuck with this USB Streaming feature... Personally, I recommend if you bought this camera to return it immediately and get a Sony MiniDV camera where you can actually use the firewire."
4,Recommended,"The title song is one of the two or three best pop Christmas songs ever - the writing, arrangement, and performance (hard to believe Stevie was only 16 or 17 when he cut it) are outstanding. The rest of the album doesn't quite have the strong social message or originality of that modern classic, but it is warm and friendly and very pop savvy. It can easily become a regular part of your holiday season, as it has mine for nearly two decades. It manages to strike a nice balance between secular and religious songs. (Though I have to disagree with those below who say you'll never hear a better ""Ave Maria"" - that's been recorded by a lot of very talented singers. Stevie more than holds his own, but he doesn't make you forget the many other fine versions that are out there).A lot of Christmas albums come and go; there's a reason this one has survived for over 30 years. Other than Mathis's and maybe Streisand's, how many holiday albums can you say that about?"
3,"Works good, but valve started leaking.","I was satisfied with how the wand worked, but the valve started leaking about one week after I started using it. I am continuing to use it because I don't want to mess with returning it."
2,Not the best Harry Potter Game,"The only cool thing about this game is that you can choose whether to play as Harry Ron or Hermione. And three people can play at the same time. Aside from that the game is not very much fun. There is no camera control, so it is hard to see all around you which is really annoying. There is also no jump button, so you cannot explore anything. Unlike all the other harry potter games there are no wizard cards to find. I always thought that was the best part, finding secret passages and wizard cards. all of that is gone in this game. In fact the gamecube game is exactly the same as the PC Goblit of Fire game. Don't waste your money on this game. There is no freedom to do what you wish in this game. It is not challanging at all until you get to voldemort at the end and that part is so frustrating and stupid. don't bother with this game."
5,perfect !,i love it ! that really what i expected and good delivering nice job at allthe sound is good
5,Absolutely thrilled....,"When I saw that they had The Tribe on dvd for region 1 I was, absolutely thrilled. I watched this show with my kids when we lived in Germany. I loved it then and I love it now. I bought the first 2 seasons, and I can't wait until they get the rest of the seasons on dvd for region 1!!"
1,If horses wore loafers,"This is certainly a sturdy piece of equipment. The problem is, it's very large, much too large for women's shoes. It's also oddly shaped. I simply cannot use it. If I ever need to slip a pair of loafers on my quarter horse, this will be really handy."
1,Lousy and Cheap,"This would be a great product if only they polished the edges; as it is, this thing is just stamped steel which by itself is no hit; but the EDGES. The edges are SHARP and will cut your shoes your socks and your skin.Perhaps we're expected to head over to a hardware store and obtain some sandpaper and polish and round off the edges?Or perhaps this is what inmates in federal penitentiaries order to file down into knives? It would be PERFECT for this!"
1,Cheap crap,"It's made of cheap, untempered steel that bends out of shape, and it has sharp edges that can cut your socks. Anti-recommended."
4,Good product,"It works as designed, it is so much more practical than the ones not made of steel, I won't damage the backs of Italian shoes"
4,Girls Gone Wild Best Of,"Girls Gone wild Best Of is a combination of the Best of Marti Gras and Best of Spring Break on one disk. The Marti Gras section shows what must be over a hundred amateur women flashing breasts and sometimes more for bead necklaces. Most of the flashing is directed toward the balconies above and not towards the camera.The Spring Break section is two bikini contests where amateur women on stage flash while dancing; Both contests end without a winner being chosen.The only real complaint I have is that there seems to be a cheering tape added to the audio with somebody making the same comment over and over; This is for both parts of the DVD. I would not really call this an X rated product because no sex takes place, it is more like a heavy R rated movie.Overall this disk is worth the money if you want to see a lot of women flashing."
5,Great for future naturalists!,"My daughter, who loves all things nature-related, loved this book. Opens up possibilities, and shows what someone can accomplish."
2,Spend more money,Did not work for me. My computer did not read this cable and therefore I had to throw it away. Spend some more money and just get a PCI video card
5,Any automation person should have,"If you think ""Automation"" you should get this one - ""Automated Software Testing"" book. Being a professional automation engineer for last 8 years, I am glad to see that this type of books start making their way to customers. Different automation approaches, example criteria are very helpful!"
5,Great Product Can be used for all kinds of Jobs,"It not often I give a review let alone a 5 star one. But this product is just what I needed. I come with a 40 Watt Iron, a nice one but the most notable thing is it can be used with any pencil iron less than 300 watts. It has a 3 prong plug on the back for the iron to plug into. This means I can use my Weller Irons as well. I like Weller because you can get tips for them most anywhere. I have 2 I use.So for just a little more than a soldering Iron holder, you get an adjustable heat control a holder with sponge and a 40 watt Iron. I don't think you can beat that."
3,Learn to spell,"This CD is one probably Cypress Hills weakest disc. It contains a few good tracks but overall it is not great. Just stick with the self title first album or Temples of Boom. Then again...if you have one Cypress album you have them all. Also, the person from Queens should learn to spell check. All of the bands he listed sucked. If you don't like rap, then don't write a review on a rap CD. Write a review for a Johnny Lang disc instead."
4,"Fun, but fake...","Don't get me wrong, I really like their songs -- they're catchy as hell...but like most ""gansta"" rappers, they are posers. I don't think they have even come close to ever killing anyone. In ""When the Sh** Goes Down"", they talk about gettin the ""sawed off Glock"", which makes NO sense. A Glock is a handgun. What are you going to do, saw off the grip?! Even Biggie used to say some totally uneducated things about firearms (taking the safety off a Glock? Glocks don't have external safeties, genius!) Just because you smoke weed doesn't make you gangsta. Try picking up a gun and actually learning about how it works before you spit all this b.s. about your gat-toting hardness. Again, I like these guys, but I know to take it all with a grain of salt. This is a band selling a product."
2,Good Wired Camera,"The ad states:And unlike many other infrared cameras, this one is completely wireless!The Truth:It requires a power cord to the camera...so it is not wireless!The video and infrared work good! Just wish that it was truly wireless."
4,Excellent CD,Great CD with great sound quality and good mix of music that will remind you of the great plays from the year!
4,IceMan,"Why is this kid so messed up? This book was about a kid who played ice hockey, and he was a big goon. People all around the country knew who he was, and hated him for his style of play. Through the book it talked about his team and how he played in the different tournaments, and it was pretty good explination in the hockey perspective. This book was a fast read, but it didnt keep my attention. I just couldn't get into the book. I think that people should read this book if they are into hockey, or if they want a dramatic book that involves family problems, or if they would like to read a good book. I would recommend that you give this book a try, and who know's, you might even like it.Kody NoltBlock 3"
3,"Cute, but cheap looking","This is a cute toy, the purpose of course is just to have the characters pop up - but I expected a little more quality in the way it was put together from this toy maker. The stickers were placed all haphazard and crooked on the front. The baby likes it, I guess that is what counts."
1,Came broken,One of the pop-ups gets stuck every once in awhile. You have to tweak it so it doesn't do that. Otherwise an ok product. My 9 month old got bored after 5 minutes.
2,"Baby likes it but....... (BPA, phthalates, etc.)","Our kid likes to play with this, so on the toy front it is great for enjoyment. The issue comes when you look at what it is made from and Playskool's policy on chemical inclusions on products (aka if it isn't illegal/banned it is fine and we'll include it) They won't say it doesn't include BPA/phthalates/etc. and imply it likely does. We returned this based on this as we try and keep the little guys exposure to a minimum."
2,Too difficult for 11 month old.,"This toy appeared as though it would be perfect, but turned out pretty disappointing. Our daughter has no trouble with other age appropriate toys, but this one has proven too difficult. The different buttons are a bit too hard to manipulate. Wait until your child is older before purchasing."
2,"Poorly made, hard to operate","This is the type of ""cause and effect"" toy often recommended for babies around 6 mos. The problem is that the buttons, knobs, etc. require FAR more strength than a baby this age can manage which is extremely frustrating for the baby. In addition, one of the levers on my daughter's toy does not ""catch"" and the door will not close unless you fiddle with it. Since her only enjoyment is closing the doors (once I've opened them) having one door NOT close after repeated tries is also confusing and discouraging. I'm sorry I bought this."
1,Bummed!,I'm so bummed. I was hoping this toy would be good for fine motor skill development but the knobs are somewhat tough to work with and not very obvious in which way it should be pushed! Terrible and very cheaply made toy for the price! I wish I can return this with free returns but there isn't that choice with this order!!
3,"So far, just okay.","I bought this toy for my baby several months ago. She is now 9 1/2 months. When I first introduced this toy at seven months, my baby was bewildered. I put it in the closet and just reintroduced it a few weeks ago. Since reintroduction, here are my thoughts:She doesn't really care about using the buttons to make the characters pop up. If I pop all the characters up she'll spend about 3-4 minutes flipping all of them back down. Often she will get her little fingers caught under the character and she'll be using her other hand to press it down, squishing her fingers. I'm glad she isn't strong enough to hurt herself yet.I will note that we received this with a blue/purplish base, not white. I expected this based on other Amazon reviews though.This is by far not one of her favorite toys. It has offered mild amusement at best. I do not recommend this product."
5,Happy Hattie,This is a perfect developement toy for my daughter who is now 9 months. She really enjoys closing the lids and is getting better and better at it. It is only a matter of time for her to start exploring how to open each top too.
4,"It's a fun, simply toy.",The toy is what it is. It's fun for short periods of time. It's good for motor skills and showing kids that things go away & come back.
3,opens with a bang!,"I think my daughter was able to move most of the levers when I first showed it to her, around 4 months, but the loud snap as the animals popped up made her wince each time, so it didn't really encourage her to play and we actually put it away for a long stretch. Now she's 8 months and the colors draw her, but again she finds it too loud, even turning half away in anticipation when she sees me about to demonstrate one of the gizmos. She enjoys pushing all of the heads back down (even loudly with banging), but I fear she may have already learned to avoid really working this toy..."
2,whatever,"This is ambient/techno music, with occasional, very short snippets of Lilly speaking. It's not unlistenable, but it's a little boring. The Lilly snippets are each a few seconds long. Other than that it's a drum machine and swooshy synth music. I would recommend the K Talk over this CD hands down."
3,Buy the print version,"While this is an excellent book,it is not well suited for reading on the Kindle. Since a full 20% of the book is devoted to notes, the lack of hyperlinks from the annotations is inexcusable. I would have enjoyed the book much more had I been able to easily access the notes as I was reading. They were inaccessable without going to the back of the book to read and then trying to get back to where the annotation had been. Aside from that one complaint, I recomend this book to anyone interested in learning about Tesla."
1,huh,"After finishing this book I have decided to throw it in the trash and find a better reference with which to try to learn if Tesla was a ""genius"". The first book I have ever felt deserved such an honor. The information presented in the book is totally lacking in any technical detail with which one can determine if this guy Tesla was as stupid as it seems. Granted he may have started off strong with his AC motor inventions-as presented in the bok the rest seems like it was hocum-a conclusion that is based on Teslas apparent inability to finish any working models of his subsequent ""inventions"" as well as to get anybody to commit any money to their developement."
2,Disappointing,"Having read all the Marvel novels and anthologies printed to date, I had high expectations which this book failed to meet. While I feel that Friedman is an excellent author, this book was very weak. The story is a continuation of one from the very early history of the X-Men, which apparently wasn't quite resolved. For those not well-versed in X-Men knowledge (if there are any who would be buying an X-Men book), this might be a difficult read, as there is very little background given for the characters. Also, there is essentially no character development and the plot was rather weak. Also, while not the most important aspect, there were numerous and repeated spelling (The country is spelled C-o-l-o-m-b-i-a, not C-o-l-u-m-b-i-a! Come on!) and grammar errors. No offense, but when I shell out for a hardback book, it would be nice if someone had proofread it. If you really wish to own this book, at least wait for paperback and save a few bucks."
1,a fan since the 1960's,"I have read X-Men comic books since the beginning. Most of the current marvel novels are very good. This particular writer is good, however this novel is very b-o-r-i-n-g. The only reason I finished it is because I paid good money for it. I am very disappointed and would not recommend it to anyone."
5,Clicker Puppy dvd a great help,"Clicker Puppy is a great visual description for parents to use to help coach their kids. It is cute, and catchy. The segment with the two cats, one being chased and one being left alone has so many applications...worth the dvd just for this showing kids (and parents) how to avoid being chased... I reccomend Clicker Puppy to all my families.Carolyn Clark"
2,Nothing to write home about!,"I read this book based on the reviews, and thinking maybe this would be a good series like Suzanne Brockmann's Troubleshooter's series. Wrong. I'm surprised by the 5 stars given to this book. It wasn't that the book was horrible; it was just lame. Tired premise of twins impersonating each other, and all through the story, you either knew what was going to happen, or you just didn't care. There was such a build-up of the Bullet Catcher guys not knowing the real story of their assignment that their boss was withholding from them, but the real story was nothing to get upset or excited about, and certainly was nothing to be withheld from the guys!Overall, this was a pretty lame book, and I doubt I would bother to read another."
3,Good Magazine,this Magazine is mostly about Lincoln (how I met Lincoln) and (America and the Holocaust)
5,EXPERT FEEL TO THE BRUSH AND SMOOTH APPLICATION,"USED THIS PRODUCT IN COMMERCIAL ENVIRONMENT AND LOVE THE RESULTS. HAVE USED ALMOST ALL OF THE ZIBRA PRODUCTS WITH EXCELLENT RESULTS AND SUCCESS. SMOOTH PAINT SPREAD, NO RUNNING OR LINT, OR STREAKS FROM THE BRUSHES. LOVE THE PANS AND THE INSERTS. WILL ONLY USE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN AND AGAIN."
5,just what i needed,works just as it says it does!!! perfect for what i needed it for. and you cant beat the price
2,Worked well at first,"These cards came with my brand new (at the time) computer and for a while they worked fine. Everything was quiet, graphics were nice and I was happy.My computer isn't even 2 years old yet and the fan has become noisy, one card has already gone bad ( I had two in my computer for gaming) and has been taken out and now I can see that the second card is showing the same signs the first card showed before it went to the graveyard.I can't even play a game as simple as Sims anymore. So this card worked great for around 1.5 years but after that they both have to be replaced and I'm not sure how long these cards are normally supposed to last so.. if 1 to 2 years is their limit.. I know this now and I'll be trying a different brand. I'm considering going back to a dell. My old dell never had this problem and I had it for many years."
3,Their Second Release...With Some Good Songs..,"Was not as Strong as their first LP\CD..Lace\Shades of Lace.By 1990 hip-hop was starting to take over real R&B;\Soul and most of the dance tracks on this cd reflect that change which is why I gave this cd three stars..if their first cd was on here for review it would get FIVE strong stars!!) the dance songs with the hip-hop beats takes the R&B; out of these tracks('My Heartbeats 4 U', 'How I'm Livin')..I really didn't care for the remix of 'Why It Gotta Be Like That'.'I Wanna Be With U'- has a nice mid-tempo groove.'Be Mine Tonight' is the best dance track, great 80's feel, love it!!now on the ballads their harmonies shine through('Whisper of The Heart', 'Love Alitte Bit More', 'Will You Be There', 'So Deep, So True'-an amazing track.)I had always wondered what happened to them- Lisa Frazier, Vivian Ross, Kathy Merrick, i wish these Ladies would record again!"
2,Very narrow!,I bought these shoes for my mom; she has a pair that she's about worn out. Unfortunately the replacement ones are extremely narrow. She couldn't wear them even with light socks. They are very narrow in the toe and they angle in beginning quite far back.
4,Love them...,Just like the ones I had back in the 70s...but now they have a cushioned insole in them. It is comfortable but they don't let the moccasin form to your foot likek the old ones. Oh well....
3,very comfortable shoes,"i was long expecting a pair of that fringed boot. the material is so soft and comfortable and the pair looks fashionable. i give that item only 3 stars is because the pair is soft sole. i can not wear them outside. other than that, great quality and fast delivery! good buy if you do not mind only indoor use.one more thing, i am usually on size 6 but this pair is a little bit larger, so if you are between size 6 and 6 1/2, size down to 6 because the shoes will stretch out after some wear."

1,mala venta,"estoy decepcionado porque me enviaron el producto que no era, habia solicitado un cable retractil y me enviaron un cable normal, que decepcion!!!"
2,Amazon,"My husband was fine with the book, but I was extremely disappointed with the Amazon service. I had a pop up of (if you spend this much you will receive free shipping). n I spent over the amount , I actually purchased 3 books in my order and was charged SHIPPING. Very disappointing."
3,Great if...,"This is a great book if you are looking to begin playing low limit texas holdem cautiously. It has very little relevance to no limit ring or tournament play. Be warned that some of the ""slow play"" strategies the author recommends can allow other players to draw a winning hand against you, thus either forcing you to fold and forfeit the chips you bet in slowing playing to build a pot or to lose the hand on the river. Otherwise quite informative in the type of hands to play and in which position to play them."
3,Alvarez Kelly,"As a lover of Westerns, I would be remiss if I would say I do not like this movie. Good entertainment!"
2,Western Misfire,"""Alvarez Kelly"" (1966) wastes an impressive amount of talent. William Holden and Richard Widmark - both decidedly miscast - fail to enliven this overlong, hackneyed Civil War adventure. The only memorable sequence in Edward Dmytryk's lackluster Western is a lavish cattle stampede. Johnny Mercer co-wrote the forgettable title song - poorly rendered by The Brothers Four. A few years later, Holden made a triumphant return to the genre in director Sam Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch."""
5,Carhartt Pocket T,"Like most Carhartt products, these shirts are hands down the best work shirts out there. Heavy weight fabric, top quality stitching and a good fit makes these shirts tops. I do wish they were made in the USA instead of Haiti but that seems to be the norm these days. Until I can find a similar quality product made in the USA, I'll stick with Carhartt. A few dollars less on Amazon.com than the local retailers."
1,Downgrade of an old standard,"I own way too many Carhartt T-Shirts. I love them. They may have changed producing companies/countries because this one is poorly made, does not fit well. and I can't even shrink it to make it work better. I am so disappointed. I'm off to my local supplier to see if they have any old stock. Good company 'till they kept cheapening the product."
2,looks sexier on the pic,"all i can say is that you get what you pay for. doesnt look as sexy as in the picture, the material was not so good, i think it gave me a lil rash...fast shipping though..."
1,Do not buy,"This is a terrible costume! Poorly made and extremely cheap material. I didn't expect alot since the cheap price but I could've made it nicer myself. I'm 5'8"" and 130 pounds (size 2) so I ordered the extra-small but the costume was very very wide and very short. Also, the arm band around the sleeves was tight so I could not move my arms around well. Needless to say, do not buy this, it's not worth $1."
1,Review from New Mexico Historical Review,"This work by an eminent writer on old-time outlaws and lawmen can be viewed from several vantage points: the storied career of Harry Morse, the ins and outs of law enforcement in the Old West, and the interplay between Hispanics and Anglos in Old California. Boessenecker describes Morse as a ""gunfighter, manhunter, and sleuth whose career is without parallel in the history of the American frontier."" More importantly, the author, like other western historians in recent years, shows the difference between the blood and thunder school of thought about Old West gunfighting lawmen who occasionally pinned on a silver star, and those individuals who saw law enforcement in the American West as a profession. As a career minded peace officer, Morse spent decades learning the techniques needed to investigate crimes and to track and capture outlaws and desperadoes. New Mexico Historical Review, April 1999."
3,Didn't captivate me,"This movie was just okay for me. We usually watch Disney/Pixar/Dreamworks movies and decided to switch things up a bit with Studio Ghibli. It didn't hold the attention of my 3 or 5-year-old, and I got a little bored towards the end. I enjoy a good animated film, and Arrietty got great reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, so my expectations were pretty high. But unfortunately the storyline didn't captivate me... And I feel it doesn't have the same watchability as my Disney or Dreamworks favorites. I don't see myself (or my kids) wanting to watch this movie over and over. So, 3 stars because I could see how someone might find beauty in the animation and music, but just couldn't give it any more since I personally wasn't intrigued by the story. I think I'll try ""Spirited Away"" next, before I write off Studio Ghibli."
1,Uninspiring Story - Cheap Graphics,"Story:Retold (borrowed?) ""The Borrowers"" 1997 movie of the same theme. Stuck in a rut storytelling of little beings we don't see living around us which when added to Studio Ghibli's using the same ""My Neighbor Totoro"" format and it all felt like a story that's been told too many times.Graphics:Studio is stuck in a Manga comic book graphic style of a non-living, non-moving backdrop with all the graphics focused upon the 2D movement of the central character for each scene. Nothing to do with cultural minimalism; it's just copying paper minimalist print style graphics.The French have surpassed the Japanese and to a great extent the Americans in producing engaging fantasy storytelling and CGI. Witness the attention to detail, even in subtle background scenes, and the individualization for each character in ""Arthur and the Invisibles: The Minimoy"". Same theme yet far more intelligent, engaging and graphically conveyed."
5,This reaches all children.,"Nothing overstated, visually pleasing and holds childrens' attention from start to finish.Should be included in all children's film libraries."
1,Harmony X Box remote,Can not really review how the remote performs because never got to use it. When we opened the package the inside of the remote was rusted because for some reason the manufacturer thought it was a good idea to package with the batteries inside the remote.The batteries rusted and spilled all inside the remote.When I contacted the company that sells this item they said I could return for a replacement. I HAD TO ASK THEM ABOUT THE COST OF SHIPPING TO RETURN THE DEFECTIVE ITEM. THEY SAID THAT I WAS TO PAY!!!!!! AFTER DISCUSSION WITH THEM THAT IF THE ITEM WERE NOT DEFECTIVE I WOULD NOT BE RETURNING IT AND I ALREADY PAID MY SHIPPING TO GET IT TO ME I SHOULD NOT BE PAYING TO RETURN IT THEY SAID THEY WOULD SEND ME A PACKING LABEL.WHEN I WENT TO SEND THE ITEM BACK IT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME BY UPS THAT THE LABEL WAS NOT VALID AS THEY PUT A EXPIRATION DATE ON IT THAT I WAS UNAWARE OF AND IT EXPIRED BEFORE I COULD GET IF REPACKAGED AND SENT BACK.WOULD NOT DEAL WITH THIS COMOANY AGAIN.
3,OK but does not work as advertised,After setting up the remote and trying it out I was at aww. Until I wanted to watch a DVD. For some reason the remote does not change my av settings on my phillips 46 inch projection. I am going to attempt to re program an update
5,Set-up was a breeze!,"The setup was really great. It took me about 15 minutes to configure everything. This remote now operates my Denon reciever, Olevia TV, Oppo DVD player, XBox 360 & HD DVD Player- all in one! The menu and set up (via your pc) was very user friendly and I am very happy with this purchase."
5,Flawless Convenience,"Programming this remote was fast and easy. I can even input more actions if I want to.There are a lot of features I haven't even used yet. I got my money's worth. The remote automatically turns on all components needed for whatever it is I want to do. If I want to play video games. At the push of one button my xbox,home theater, and tv come on, and I never have to leave my bed. Thanks logitech for spoiling me. It is a great buy."
5,"Great remote, very well built","I purchased this remote knowing I wanted it. Flipping between 4 remotes was a hastle, knowing where all of the buttons were was a pain. This remote now keeps it all nicely in one place with buttons that I can set. Very well built, it feels sturdy and smooth. The channel buttons near the bottom are slightly small, however it just took a week of getting used to before I don't notice a thing.Great product, good support, easy installation."
5,Awesome Remote,"I was a bit hesitant purchasing a tech product that was originally released a couple years ago (2005/2006) but have been completely satisfied with it so far. This remote significantly simplifies my TV setup - eliminating the need to constantly switch between four different remotes for different functions.I'm using it with a Samsung LN40A550 40"" LCD, Samsung HTA100T DVD/speaker system, Comcast/Motorola 3412 DVR, and XBOX 360. This remote works perfectly with all of these. I'm love the ability to completely customize exactly what appears in the LCD options menu and the ability to reorder specific functions.Bottom line: if you're looking at this product you've probably invested a significant amount of money in your home AV setup. Why not pay $70 bucks to make your devices work together seamlessly?"
4,pretty good remote,"I was able to get all but 3 items programmed with this remote. Otherwise, its a pretty powerful remote, and works as a Xbox 360 remote flawlessly. The 2 items...1) I cannot seem to get the remote, when you change ""activities"", is to transform into the receiving activity remote - it gives you basic commands, but not the entire component's programmed commands...it takes switching to the component's remote setup - 2 extra buttons - this is for going from ""Watch 360"" and ""Watch TV"" - it should just switch to the component's programming, not the activity's programming2) I cannot get the power on/off to hit only the two components I want it toother than those 2, excellent remote at a great price."
3,My Summer with Julia,I found the book somewhat dark and not very exciting reading. Not one of better books I've read.
2,"a sad , tragic tale of deception and despair","This story is a sad one, more so evident as time has gone by. Pike was an alcoholic, looking for and rejecting religion, attention - seeking, embattled and ultimatley literaley and figuratively lost. His son committed suicide and Pike set out on an increasingly desperate attempt to prove life continues. This is Pike's book about finding proof of the ""Other Side"". The thing is, Pike was tricked and deceived, as was admitted after Pike's death.Pike got lost in the desert in the Holy Land, died there, and his body was not found for some time. - this might sound like a metaphor but it is also what really happened. May he now be at peace."
2,Phooey!,"Although I would encourage anybody looking for a good (if not deep) read to pick up ""Blind Justice"", the first book in this series, I would advise those same people to avoid this book. Everything is too pat: Sir John Fielding is too wise and knowing; Jeremy (his assistant) is too nobly naive; their comrades too goody-goody; the bad guys are identified by wearing (no joke) black. The attempts at poignancy are as phony as a sit-com. Samuel Johnson would probably not recognize the sentimentalized version of him. There isn't even a mystery to solve. Shallow on most every account."
4,A Good Choice,This stroller a good choice. I have twins and with the double car seat attachments it makes going from car to stroller super easy. It is also very simple to open and close. It only takes a second and it's either ready to go or ready to be put up.My only complaint is that whenever you go to collape it to store you have to lock in four of the six wheels. Because those four caster (which is great in and of itself) you have to lock them in so as not to damage them. It is sometimes difficult to remember when your trying to get going quickly.All in all I would recommend it.
4,Graham Greene in a different role,"It has been a while since I viewed this movie but I do recall that I found the role of Arthur an interesting turn for Graham Greene. Most of the exposure I had of him to that point was his role in Dances with Wolves, Maverick and his occasional appearance on the Red Green Show as the bumbling explosives ""expert"". I appreciated seeing him in a role where he isn't portrayed as the nice guy or ""Noble Savage"" (for lack of a better term). I thought the story was solid enough and I'll admit I was shocked to see Mr. Greene commit the acts of violence (the finger removal scene was unexpected). I think it is a must see for fans of Graham Greene."
1,A very fine line between zealousness and insanity,"The one star is for Graham Greene. Otherwise,I thought that, in addition to being a poorly made film--bad script, bad directing and poor film quality--this was a ridiculously violent and gory movie. I love Graham Greene and no one can fault his acting, but he must have just needed a job at this point--nothing else explains his judgment to be in this one. I think his character came off as pathologically violent and cruel, not as one zealousy guarding his way of life. The confrontation scenes between Native Americans and loggers in the beginning were ludicrous. The story did not progress in any logical way and the ending was flat. I didn't find anything mystical about the ""message"", as some other reviewers did. I, too,would love to be able to return this tape. I guess I'll just toss it in the garbage and consider it a lesson."
4,Great Ranger Belt,"This is just the belt I was looking for! It's a great addition to your jeans and boots if you want to look sharp but not flashy. My only problem with it (hence only 4 stars) is that it's a little on the short side --- I'm on the last prefabricated hole. I recommend going up a size on your regular belt-length if you want to leave a little room to ""grow"". Or maybe I'll use this as a motivation to drop a few pounds..."
3,GET IT AT TARGET!,Hi I was all set to buy these seasons separately and then I found a double pack at Target for $15! I haven't even seen it. I've heard great things though so if you're even thinking about buying or watching it I say buy it at Target.
1,Repulsive!,"I have never heard anything worse than this CD. I like some pop music, but not PYT at all! They are terrible! They are just a bunch of little teen prostitutes singing (screeching) about things they can't possibly understand yet. (Like love - I'm 15 and I admit I don't know what love is, but they think they do... ha.) The worst part is that they did a song that said, ""Why are you jealous of me cause I'm in PYT?"" Um... girls? Nobody's jealous of you, unless they want to be a stuck up little whore too. And it irks me to see that they're singing about fame that they haven't even achieved, and never will. Don't buy this(***)!"
2,"Terrible range, Amazon screws you on the return","I was replacing an ancient V-tech cordless phone system with this Uniden. It keeps dropping the signal in my house, from the bedroom to the living room. No other electronics were running at the time.Also, Amazon makes you pay back the ""free"" shipping when you return an item, not just the shipping to send the item back. Don't buy something here if you aren't sure of the quality, you'll do better returning it if you purchase from a local store."
1,Worst phone since my first cordless in 1992.,"I have been a happy Uniden customer for years -- and then I bought this phone. I read the customer reviews here on Amazon before buying the phone and discounted the feedback from folks who said they couldn't call from the Caller ID screen and had volume problems. Well... believe it. You can't call from the Caller ID screen (I've contacted Uniden directly about this and they've yet to give me an answer - which probably means you can't) and in response to the volume problem they suggested I ""knock"" on the top of the phone when the volume goes down. (Yeah, that will go over real well with my clients.) This is a horrible phone. Look elsewhere."
5,"Great cordless, big improvement over my last Uniden","I finally found a phone I have no problems with no matter where in the house or yard I use it. The microwave interfered with my last uniden but this one works perfectly. I love the ease of turning off the ringer, and I LOVE LOVE the room monitor feature- especially that it doesn't alert he person in the room that they are being monitored (don't want to wake the baby or let my older boys know I'm checking in on them!)I only wish the caller ID didn't delete the times the caller called if they call from the same number more than once. But, that's hardly a big deal when all the other features are everything I need! FINALLY!You can't go wrong with this set! (and I am a hard person to please, I've been thru several cordless phones before being happy with this one!)"
1,It Has a Range of About 6 Feet,"I bought this phone system as a supplement to (and an upgrade to) my existing Panasonic 2.4 GHz phone system. I thought that the 5.8 GHz Uniden would have an even better range than the Panasonic. Boy was I ever wrong! The Uniden handset can barely reach a few feet from the base unit before it starts up with the crackling and static and dropping words. Sitting one room away (one small room away) the Uniden is just about unuseable. The Panasonic works great in the same space, so the problem is in the Uniden phone. What a disappointment and waste of money."
3,Works great in range - would like broader range,I've had this phone for a while and it works great in range for the most part - however I had expectations of a broader range. I keep the base in my office in the back corner of the house - my house is only about 1000 sq ft - and will lose reception on the back patio - maybe less than 100 feet away.
4,Copper Sheet is Copper Sheet.,I needed this for a hobby project. The sheet was clean of any marks or creases.It did however come in a huge package 4 feet X 5 inches X 5 inches. I thought I mis-ordered and ordered a few square yards as opposed to one square feet.
2,"Excellent receiver, NMEA over USB w/Garmin Spanner software","I originally stated that there is no NMEA over USB. Actually there is -- it requires Garmin's free Spanner software to create a virtual COM port. Garmin phone support was unhelpful (and wrong), telling me you could not do it. About a week later I got an email from their email support guys that told me how to do it and where to download the necessary software. The unit is quite excellent."
2,Garmin 76 csx attery terminals break easy.................,"Battery terminals break easy.. Quite a few owners have complained about this problem on the 76csx forum..If it wasn't for the battery terminal problem, the 76csx would be a great unit."
1,Understand what you're buying; I didn't,"I was looking for a GPS to generate waypoints for a flying application, gathering them first on the ground. I also hoped to use the device as a car navigator. This device, which seems to work ok, for what it is. Does not come with any maps (street, marine, topo, or aviation) it does not talk and is useless in the car without maps.I called Garmin for advice before buying this and they passed me from one department to another. Nobody knew anything about the GPSMap series, to speak of. When I bought street maps and they wouldn't load, the phone wait was 40 minutes so I sent an e-mail which has not been answered for a week now."
2,Suunto watch replacement strap,Suunto makes a great watch but the strap breaks about once a year. At $49.00 each to replace it's close to highway robbery and makes an otherwise great watch undesireable.
2,Too expensive and flimsy,Suunto must make all their money on watchbands. This is the fourth one I've replaced. They last about 12-18 months. Only the Suunto brand fits and is very expensive for two pieces of rubber.
3,Great... for a while,"I bought this laser pointer because my dog loves chasing laser ""points"" and the laser pointers sold at pet stores have two big flaws: The point is only bright when the battery is very new, and the buttons break quickly, so that pressing the button will sometimes succeed, sometimes fail to turn on the laser.The Atlasnova laser pointer was initially great- the point is far more intense than with a cheap pet store laser pointer.Unfortunately, after repeated use, the button on my Atlas Nova has the same problem that I've experience with cheap laser pointers- it fails to consistently turn the light on.Perhaps I'm not using this laser pointer as intended, but for those of you who want to use this with your pet, it's probably just better to buy a whole bunch of cheap pet store laser pointers and throw them out as their buttons break.... that said, the laser point *is* really intense and pretty cool... while the button lasts."
4,"The Hard Questions: 100 Essential Questions to Ask Before You Say ""I Do""","Even though answering these questions with my boyfriend resulted in a end to our relationship, I am very glad because we had discussed marriage. After two failed marriages, I knew that I had to do something differently before thinking about marriage again. These questions and our answers revealed that for us that being friends is fine, but not mates for life. Thanks Sierra"
2,Likewise,"Like many of the other people, I was disappointed with the depth of this book. It is very small and the questions don't really cover enough of relationships.I got 1000 Questions for Couples which ended up perfect for us."
1,Recommend something else.,"I also saw this on Oprah and was excited. Was a let down...I was hoping it would be more Christian based and not so superficial. I would recommend ""300 Questions Every LDS Couple Should Ask Before Marriage-- Alder. It's for mormons but most of the questions are christian based if your looking for something with that slant."
3,Trite plot but a beautifully filmed western,"Stripped to its bare essentials, this western is a treasure hunt for a hidden canyon of gold that legend says is guarded by Apache spirits and tabu for whites and prospectors. The dire warnings of death and destruction don't discourage an assorted party of white men, among them a law man, outlaws, and a cavalry sergeant who set out across desert and mountain with Apaches on their trail. Gregory Peck is the star and is the good guy who's forced into an uneasy partnership with wanted man Omar Sharif. Several well-known names are among the cast, including Edward G. Robinson, Eli Wallach, Lee J. Cobb, Burgess Meredith and Telly Savalas in what looks like a Hollywood all-star casting call. The scenery steals the picture and if the premise isn't taken seriously, the film is enjoyable two-hour plus pastime."
4,This is a good movie!,"I don't understand why Leonard Maltin and one or two of the customer reviews are so dismissive of this movie. I agree that it's not the Magnificent Seven or the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, but this is a very well made movie. It plays in the light hearted style of a fable or campfire tale and is not pretentious. You couldn't ask for a better cast or production values or special effects. The plot is simple but that's part of the charm of this movie. I guarantee that 90% of western fans will enjoy it."
1,"Too difficult to adjust, install","I got this as a gift from my registry and just installed it in my husband's car now that my 6 month old son has outgrown the infant carrier. I have a Britax Roundabout in my car. The Eddie Bauer can't compare to the Britax both in terms of the ease (or should I say difficulty) of adjusting the seat (moving straps higher, lower, etc.) and the installation. My husband and I had to read the instructions three times to figure out how to remove the infant headrest and adjust the bottom strap. The seat is so large that we didn't even attempt to install rear-facing in my husband's pickup (he only drives my son three blocks to daycare in the morning). I have the prior model and it wouldn't be worth it to return it and get the Britax...but if I could have done my registry over, it would have been Britax all the way!"
3,cleaning isn't easy,My husband and I researched for carseats and we found that the eddie bauer would be the best one. Our daughter seemed to be very comfortable. My husband wanted to buy another one for our next child. The problem is that our daugther go sick all over the car seat and herself. Cleaning the seat was very difficult. Taking the covering off was impossible. I don't understand why it should be so hard. Due to this I am not sure we will purchase another one.
3,"I like it, but not when it's rear-facing...","We bought this for our son at 6 months when he outgrew the infant seat. He was probably long overdue to get a new seat, but anyway, he's almost 8 months now and still when he falls asleep in it, his little head slumps. This is because the seat doesn't recline back very far at all like the infant seat did.We tried it first in my car, a Nissan Altima, that has sloping seats in the back and we though that the seats were the issue, so we moved it to our SUV with flatter back seats, thinking that would solve the slumping issue. It didn't. I think the only solution is for him to get older and we can turn the seat around.Either way, one of the ""great features"" is that it reclines for comfort. Well it doesn't recline enough and my son doesn't look comfortable at all when he's trying to catch some zzzzz's in the car."
1,Kindle version stinks!,"In the kindle version there are blank pages in the middle of the story and sometimes the text is on the wrong page. If you just judge it on the original text, which I also have, the story is quite good for little readers. The sentences are short and simple. It is also funny to struggling readers. Get this book but not on kindle."
5,"great first reader, cute book","My daughter enjoyed reading this. It is a great book for an emerging reader, basically short vowels and simple letter combinations, repetition, nice illustrations. This whole series (step into reading) really beats out the other series' for me - the level 1 books seem to be truly level 1. Their boxed sets are quite nice as well."
3,Incomplete,"The free kindle edition ofArmadalelooks wonderful and it contains page numbers, which is a real help when citations are needed. However, this edition only contains Book the First. It was inconvenient to find out that it didn't carry the rest of the book. Hopefully this error will be fixed in the near future.That aside it was still nicely formatted and contained no grammatical errors like a few other free kindle books."
4,Wonderfuly written tale,"Love conquers all in this fascinating tale of two families at war. I was transfixed from page one, always wondering what would happen next, and trying to figure out the riddle of it all. From the Barbosssa house set back among the hills of North Carolina, a man sits down to write a family history. It turns out to be a tale of love and hatred between clans- one a powerful American family(aka the Kennedys), and the other a phsycic, magical, sometimes evil family that has been around since the dawn of time. The two could not exist without each other, but yet one yearns for the destruction of the other. A lovely girl from Ohio is swept off her feet and finds herself emersed in the battle between a man's heart and his soul. I thought this book was brilliantly written as well as a great story."
1,"One lousy book, and then another","Read Andy Stanford, Massad Ayoob and Brian Enos. If your a revolver kind of person, read Ed McGivern. But give this guy a miss. The info in this book amounts to about a chapter's worth, it's poorly presented and over-priced. If you want TWO chapters of a bad book, buy his other one as well. But better, spend your hard-earned dough on a better author. Shucks - buy Gil Hebard's ""The Pistol Shooter's Treasury."" Just skip Stephens as a bad deal."
5,Good little manual to get started!,"Good base for getting started, very imformative. A must for the beginning handgunner!"
4,Great musicianship,"There's no denying Paul Gilbert's incredible talent on the guitar, but kudos to his song writing abilities, too. Okay, so some of the songs aren't exactly about family values (Mr. Skin or Tell the Truth -- both are suggestive, though the latter is definitely more frank about it), but the compositions are uniquely his own. Of course, the solos are great and some of the licks just downright leap out at you with feeling. If you're looking for the neo-classical shred-fest that Gilbert sorta pigeon-holed himself into with his RacerX affiliation, you should probably look elsewhere. This is a ""happy"" sounding album and the flying dog on the cover says it all, in my opinion."
3,Story 3; audio reader 1,"I am having bad luck with audio books; in particular romance mysteries. The women just cant do a man's voice convincingly enough for me. This time she made Lillian sound like such a priss. Finally, got the book from the library, forgot the audio and had a great time with it. The first chapter is a howl. Gabe & Lillian are a tough couple to rate, so I just went along with the book. The premise was weak but, it's summer and I have decided to just read and enjoy. Not much time is invested and it is a nice addition to the trilogy. I would recommend the 'Naked in Death"" unabridged audio; now there's a woman who can do all voices and make it work!"
5,Eclipse Bay Books are the best she's written in years!,"I've been a fan since Ms. Krentz' Candelight Ecsatsy Romance days, and she is one of the rare authors I followed to hardback. Nevertheless, I had just about given up on her after the last several Krentz/Quick stilted and formulaic offerings. The Eclipse Bay books, in paperback no less!, are a return to the much more lively and entertaining books I expect from this author."
3,Funny and enjoyable story about 2 rival families,"This book has a lot of truly funny scenes. I enjoyed it tremendously. I'm not sure whether the real love story is about the two families or the two main characters. Jayne Ann Krentz's make characters are always a bit odd but quite lovable. Once the two characters stop fighting and start enjoying being together, the book gets a little flat, but then the action kicks in with the mysterious burglar and the attack on the town's resident crackpot. All in all, a slightly predictable story but still fun to read."
3,The storyline...a little scattered,"I bought the unabridged audio version of Dawn In Eclipse Bay because I liked the 3rd book in the series, Summer In Eclipse Bay. The story started out okay and then things got a little off track so much so that I felt it really detracted from the barely there romance of the main characters, Gabe and Lillian. It seemed more like a business deal. I think I would have enjoyed the abridged version better as a lot of the detracting fluff would have been left out....just my opinion, of course."
3,Dawn in Eclipse Bay reliable read....,"I liked the characters and the setting of this book. They may be a bit familiar and predictable, yet that doesn't ruin the experience of reading in my opinion. When I pick up a Jayne Ann Krentz book, I am comfortable with the fact that it will ring certain bells. But that is her style, and I like recognzing her ""voice"" as I read. This is an enjoyable, light hearted read, perfect for a lazy summer day."
4,Not too happy,I gave it four stars because the black one works great however the red one is dried out. Maybe they have been sitting on the shelf too long. I gave it four star because of the black but the red one gets a big thumbs down.
4,Fun for all ages,"In this highly entertaining book, punmaster Richard Lederer reveals the tricks of the punster's trade while challenging readers to create original wordplay of their own. In sixteen chapters, with titles such as ""Calling on the Homophone,"" ""Puns That Babylon,"" and ""Tairy Fales,"" the author explains how to use homophones, homographs, and spoonerisms for comical effect while exploring knock-knock jokes, Tom Swifties, and other types of jokes and riddles based on the deft manipulation of sound and meaning. The author presents a clear and simple explanation of each form, provides numerous examples, and then invites readers to create original jokes, rhymes, and puzzles of their own. Language-lovers of all ages will appreciate the wealth of wit and humor presented on these pages."
5,The books that turned the tide,"These books reshaped the the way people thought about Star Wars. Their action, and amazing plot, gave the idea a rebirth which continues to this day. Read these books, they're well worth the time and money."
3,Disappointing,"What can I say, I just wasn't very please the overall finished product. Their hit single ""Can't Stop Lovin' You""!?! <<cough>> cheesy <<cough>>It certainly doesn't live up to previous VH standards, let alone early VH IMO(I've said it before and I'll say it again...Sammy is no Diamond Dave!).Each to his/her own, I guess--a lot of people *do* like this album, so maybe you will too. Try it out!"
2,"SOME GOOD, SOME BAD","This cd shows, in my opinion, the reason Sammy Hagar was kicked out of the band. His vocals are scratchy and off-key. That aside, there are some good songs. ""Feelin"" & ""The Seventh Seal"" are both top-notch. However, this cd contains ""Big Fat Money,"" which is the worst song VH has ever done. I recommend this cd for diehards only."
3,Kicks like a soccer mom,"Averse to the school of sheer sexual shred, this still remains the only Halen I'm havin' (as good as older songs can be on occasion). And it still is only decent enough to warrant rare dust-offs for some deeper songwriting licks in between lifeless rock routines, on a production encroaching geezerdom that only really seems to accentuate properly during slower ballads and instrumental passages."
2,Waste of Money!,Crossing Over and Can't stop loving you are the only worthytracks on this album. This album was worse than Van Halen 3but people give it a higher rating? Makes no sense to me.Worse album they ever made.
3,Decent attempt at follow up to Cardinal Knowledge,"For those of you who think that Cardinal Knowledge is a bit too hard, try the softer side of Van Halen with their studio follow up Balance. This album has a noticably more ""romantic"" feel with songs like ""Cant Stop Lovin' You"" and ""Feelin"". But if those songs have got you reachin' for the tissues, crank out songs like ""The Seventh Seal"" and ""Amsterdam"", that'll be sure to cure your ""wheres my baby"" blues! Wanna hear something interestingly different? Try ""Big Fat Money""..that one will definantly leave you scratching your head! But as a whole, Balance is a very good follow up to their previous studio release Cardinal Knowledge."
3,"Balance is uneven, not ""weak""","I enjoyed this outing. Let's face it, this is the last Van Hagar CD you're going to get. The lyrics are no worse than any previous VH Albums, and there are some nice textures and mood pieces that I don't recall in any of their earlier stuff. Though it's clear that Eddie is having himself a pity-party at times, this has enough juice to include in the O'l collection."
2,weak,After hearing For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge i was convenced van halen couldn't get any better! .....and as it turned out i was right. though seventh seal and don't tell me (what love can do) were good tracks the rest nearly put me to sleep. it was disapointing to me that the sammy era of van halen had to end on such a poor note.....okay actually that isn't true. they did humans being for Twister and that song kicks major a$$.
3,Inbalance,"Almost released as an instrumental album after Hagar walked out near the end of the sessions. The VH boys are weaker here and running out of ideas. Sure, Amsterdam is the hash capitol of the world, but did we really need an anthem for the city written by a 50 year old rocker."
4,Pinnacle of Van Hagar,This was the height of Van Hagar-Halen. Easily the best album since 5150 and light years better than VH 3.
2,VH,Not near their best album by far. The worst was that thing with Gary from the band Extreme. What was Eddie thinking when he got this guy for the album? I can't believe they will be back with David Lee Roth for a forthcoming new album. I thought they hated dude. I wish they could all get along and Sammy be lead singer.C U in Hel*CrackerJack Steve
4,Wonderful,This was a great story but am not sure how much is real truth and how much is not. Very old but still a good job restoring it to DVD. AND it was closed captioned/subtitled!
3,Fascinating case study of the politics of urban planning,"A fascinating book. . . . It was published long ago. But its lessons are still relevant. The book is based on a series of case studies of planning in New Jersey communities. Rabinovitz categorized each city's power structure (from centralized to dispersed power) and the role its planners adopted (from politicized to technicians who applied standard planning formulae to the situation at hand). The lesson? Planning role and community power structure interacted, in that some planners would be more successful in one power structure context than in another. By establishing this, Rabinovitz clearly suggests the relevance of city politics for the success of the planning process.Again, dated. Also, the conclusions are based on a small number of communities. Nonetheless, a thought provoking volume. . . ."
1,I was recieved the it,The item that I have received it not like what announced in the webpage. It is very old and with ugly style. I was shocked when I received this book.
4,A Christmas Memory,DVD was ordered and received as detailed in description. Got by date promised. Looking forward to watching it at Christmas.
2,Kind of a bore,"This may be a ""classic tale"", but there have to be better movies out there. It is not a bad movie, but it has so little point to it, relative to Christmas or anything else, that it just is not worth the time to watch it or the money to buy it."
3,Not what I expected,"I thought the description of this movie was misleading. I wasn't familiar with the story at all so went strictly by the short description on the website. The acting was great, and the majority of the movie was delightful. However, if you're looking for a feel-good, happy-ending, everything-comes-out-okay movie, this isn't it. I took it to our family Christmas, and we were all bummed out by the ending. It's definitely worth watching from an artistic standpoint, but I found it depressing."
3,More Feynman,"This book is a mixed salad which does not come up to the information and entertainment values of previous books published on Feynman. They seem to be scraping the bottom of the barrel and in the next one I expect a copy of his Bar Mitzva speech, if he gave one."
1,Strong Smell/Out-Gassing,"I received this item about two weeks ago, but have yet to put it to good use because of the strong chemical smell due to out/off gassing - particularly disturbing since I'm hoping to use it as a birthing ball. I've let it air out on the fire escape and in a small storage room; the room took on the odor after a few days.I haven't been particularly sensitive to smell throughout my pregnancy, so I'm reluctant to chalk it up to that. Regardless, I'd warn anyone in small apartments or non-ventilated spaces away from this ball."
1,This ball is no good,"This ball lasted about a week and half then started deflating. I tried pumping it up again, but then it lasted about two days and after that not even 2hours."
3,2Pac's early work. Not 4 new fans,"I have spent probably over $400 on 2pac memorbilia. I have all his US cds and lots of imports & bootlegs.(I have Unreleased 2pac email me 4 info.) When I bought this cd, i was very disapointed. This cd is like a bootleg w/ bad sound and blurry lyrics. Buy this only if you want all of 2pac's cd's & willing to waste the money. RIP Makaveli the don"
3,Not as compelling as Powell's previous books,"I found it difficult to believe that high school students would be interested in this story, which seems to focus more on Gardner Dickinson's father's mid-life crisis than on the teenager and his struggle to deal with the problems this causes for his family. Although there are some elements that usually draw teen readers in--such as the hint of romance, and Gardner's increasing interest in running--the story didn't suck me in or keep me interested. It was sort of a depressing look at parental unemployment and mid-life ennui, without any analysis of the effect that has on individual teens. I won't reveal the ending, but I will comment that it seemed unlikely that a high school student would make the choice Gardner did."
5,Green parrot/great book,"I read this book to my children over and over. My copy is water stained and binding damaged. I read it to my 3 oldest grandchildren. They loved finding the parrot and all the other colorful things in the pictures (we often went beyond ""where is the green parrot?"" to things like ""where is the blue conductor?"", etc. Time now to find a new copy for the 2 year old grandchild!"
5,Great Book,I learned so much from this. It was very interesting.I love Bram Stoker so knowing all this was great for me.
5,the quintessential doom album,"As far as the genre of doom-metal is concerned, this si the best band and album there is. If you've never heard electric wizard before, here it now. The guitar sound is unbelievable. It sounds like a plane crash or somehting. Awesome."
3,Not what I thought.,"After hearing all the hype about the Orange Goblin/Electric Wizard EP I figured I'd check out one of their albums. Well, the music is good but all the added noise starts to get on your nerves. The songs are sometimes way to long. What they could say in three minutes instead takes six. I don't know why OG ever decided to do an EP with them because OG just blows the Wizard off the map. Everybody is getting into the '70s metal sound now. Check out Down or even Fu Manchu. Alabama Thunderpussy, although not as heavy, is a better sound then these guys. If you want to hear really good music from this genre check out Orange Goblin's Frequencies From Planet Ten or Time Travelling Blues if you can find it."
5,2 Year Old Can't Stop Watching,"We ordered this DVD hoping that our 24 month old would watch it during a 4 hour plane flight. It was ordered a couple of days before, so we played it for him prior to the trip to see if he'd like it. He loved it, and is still asking to watch it every day 30 days after we received the DVD. The music on this DVD makes it fun to sing along with, and there is always a lesson to be learned."
4,it seems to help,"In my limited experience with this product I can say that it reduced the litterbox ammonia smell substantially, but doesn't seem to get rid of it altogether. I'm talking about using it as an additive in a single litterbox used by 2 cats though, so perhaps you could see better results if your litterbox sees less ""traffic."" It's hard to justify paying for litter additives, when good litter itself is no minor expense. I guess it really depends on your tolerance for odor levels as to whether something like Ammo Cat will be a good value for you or not."
4,cutting through the red tape,I used this reference book to help my daughter find the correct schools which specialized in her quest for a sports scholarship..
4,two for the price of one,"two of Sammy's best Decca years' output. Particularly the second CD, ""I Gotta Right To Sing"", which features the Basie Band, minus The Count . Interesting contrast is this CD with the Reprise release, ""Our Shining Hour"", Sammy Davis-Count Basie, which is another great release. The only reason this first CD does not get five stars is because there are three tracks where Sammy sings Ray Charles songs, which are, truthfully, a bit weak (can't stand hearing him sing ""rock and roll"", anyway). Almost as bad as hearing him sing the theme from My Mother The Car (from the ""That's All"" CD), but otherwise really great."
2,Complete outdated snore-fest,"I bought this book as part of a boat design class. Everything in this book was state of the art during WWII, but can be replaced with about 2 hours of CAD instruction. Also, I've actually lofted and built quite a few boats, and the methods used here make a fairly simple and straight-forward process seem incredibly complicated. Good cure for insomnia."
4,good book,"well written lots of information, but several years old, I thought it would be 2008, some things are gone others have changed owners, but we'll take it with us and over all good information"
1,Frommer's Maine Coast - Soso,I found this help guide to be a little vague. I was mostly looking for in-depth information regarding Bar Harbor and Acadia National Park - one of our country's best-kept secrets that is absolutely breathtaking! The book did not go into great detail. It only gets a 1 in my book!
1,Waste of Money,Save your money. This product is horrible. My kids used it once and it's been in the closet since. It's not even as good as our karoke machine.
4,What I Just Found Out,"Where has this information been hiding for so long. Bloomfield has done a good job of explaining the vital importance this ""super food"" plays in our health. Whether it is in the form of the oil or the powder, or the lingen rich fiber. One additional thing I have learned from a site called PapaNature is the blending of flax oil and omega 3. PapaNature reinforces Bloomfield's explanations on the importance of flax in our health. It also offers a choice of products and versions of flax."
1,There isn't enough time for this book,"Taylor Caldwell's ""There was a Time"" is a bleak but unsatisfying view of life for the poor in America in the early part of this century. It focuses on the struggle of Frank Clair to rise above his friendless and loveless circumstances to become a successful writer. Despite some promising settings and characters (the hills of Kentucky, the factories and schools of upstate New York, the Depression), and the potential to say something about the big issues of the times such as poor industrial conditions, segregation, anti-British setiment during WWI, the book in the end does nothing except follow the mopings of the protagonist from emotional failure to disappointing moment. The book is also quite sloppily written with some glaring continuity errors. None of the characters which are remotely likeable stay around for long."
3,Great seat until,"The seat was great until..The head rest broke and will not stay up. The head rest falls down and my childs head sits above the rest. I bought the Booster seat for the head support. I want to send it back to Britax, but I need to buy another seat while I send this back. Also the cup holders are small and hard for my child to get out. I have had this seat only since Dec 07 so it shouldn't have broke."
5,A Visual Feast,"Magical and haunting, ""Seeing in the Dark"" is a beautifully photographed and inspirational account of the significant impact of amateurs in the field of astronomy. Even if you know little about the stars, you'll be enchanted by the imagery and engaged by the age-old question of man's place in the universe. This production should be the starting point of many interesting discussions, in and out of the classroom. Highly recommended, especially in HD."
3,Source Naturals Coenzyme Q10,I didnt see anywhere that a serving was 3 gel caps every day. bottle sure wont last long. will explore other brands ect.
3,A Movie that Takes Itself too Seriously,"O.K. I don't know what planet these other reviewers are from, but it seems they were watching a different movie. I agree that The Unholy is worth watching-I've seen it several times because it is so funny. I mean we've got priests calling from the dead-ON THE TELEPHONE, no less. My friend and I saw this back when we were in college and have been calling each other as Father Dennis ever since. This movie takes itself way to seriously-this is a great B flick, but certainly not all the raves I've read in these other reviews. If you're expecting an excellent film, the likes of Rosemary's Baby, don't bother. However, if you're looking for a fun, scary laugh, the likes of Carnosaur, then, by all means, check this one out!"
4,Fabulous!,"Stays fresh with every listen. A delicious blend of sexy style and classy appeal. With funky grooves, smooth energy, and slick vocals...how can you go wrong?A timeless addition to any music lover's collection."
5,New Christy MInstrels,I just like the sound and style of the New Christy Minstrels. The Cd's have excellent sound quality THe style is great. I recommend this cd if you like that style of folk music.
1,Hated it then. Hate it now.,"I have love Monty Python guys from childhood, which is why I wanted to see this movie when it first came out in the movie theatre. Unfortunately, it was pure torture. My sister wanted to walk out but I wanted to stay at least to see the headline beast. When we finally saw the Jabberwocky, that was it. If I hadn't been so steadfast in staying til the end and leaving when my sister wanted to, we would have demanded out money back."
2,Don't expect,This book disappointed me. I hoped a good overview but this only just repeated the RFCs without value added. Anyway it is useful for an introduction if your expectations are low.
5,Great Series!!,"Sorry, but you are wrong about your review and the edited version for PBS.This is a wonderful saga and I have seen both the unedited and edited version and really only the sex is edited out and nothing is lost because of it. In fact, I found it is better as the edited version and one focuses much more on characters and storyline.Matthew Macfadyen in particular is wonderful in this and I hope he wins a BAFTA and Emmy for his performance--just stellar. Hayley Atwell is gorgeous and she makes a very nice match to him. One thing that is a wee bit distracting is the different actors in one role but it is supposed to be three ""selves"" in one so one can imagine that.All in all, it is a wonderfully made and quite engrossing series. An added bonus is that Kim Cattrall, The Great Tom Hollander and Gillian Anderson all playing character roles to their greatest.Definitely a five-star production."
4,Perfect for the little fan,"Soothing and relaxing, these lullabies are perfect for the young fan. Some of the songs are difficult to pick out, but my children didn't seem to mind. It's a great background for a well-needed nap. I even catch myself nodding off from time to time when it's playing. I highly recommend this for any U2 fan who wants to bring their kids up ""right"" and who are getting tired of the baby indoctrination CD or DVD du jour."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this and the Pink Floyd Lullaby CD... this is just as bad... Actually both cd's sound the same, nothing like the actual songs, and just like the Floyd cd, the sound is annoying and definitley not soothing... I recomend buying the regualr cd, not the lullaby versions."
5,Great Lullaby!!!,"This is a great CD for newborns and adults alike. U2 translates well to lullaby music, and I am highly recommend any of these Cd's from Rockabye Baby!"
4,Too bad it doesn't play DVD movie.,"Howdy, I'm running this DVD drive on a G3 Mac with Tiger 10.4.10 Via Firewire. This is the first external CD or DVD drive for Mac that i've seen that's gotten so many positive reviews. I've only burned CD's so far, but not a bad CD yet. The CD's I've been using are Memorex CD-R I got on sale at Target. Toast 6 lite is easy to use. All you have to do is click and drag. For basic CD/DVD burning Toast 6 lite seem to do the job well. My only problem with the Toast 6 lite is it doesn't play DVD movie, and my G3 is to old for the latest version of Toast, Oh well."
4,99 Luft Ballons!,You cannot go wrong with this collection Nena fans. It's a great addition to your Nena cds.It really does seem like a time line of her career.
2,Not going to fit a toddler,"I put this carrier on my bicycle, hoping to go for a nice ride with my almost 3 year old girl. She weighs about 30 pounds, far less than the 40 pounds the packaging says it will hold. After deciphering the instructions, and getting the seat on the bike, I put my daughter in the seat. Ok, so far so good. Then I got on the bike. I'm 5'9 180 pounds and she couldn't sit there without hitting my butt/back as I rode. She lasted about 20 feet before she asked to get out because it was so uncomfortable. Nothing was adjustable, so I had to take it back off, and begin the search again for another carrier... She was so disappointed! :("
5,awesome.,"I love this seat and so does my 10 month old! He can't stand being in his infant car seat, but laughs and even falls asleep in the bike seat! Easy to assemble and attach to the bike, I love it."
2,Not recommended for tall children,"The product quality is good. We bought this product when we saw that our son met the age, and weight requirement. After an hour of installation, we learned that our son was too tall for it. We toughed it out, and after 5-10 mins of riding with him in the seat, we removed it. My son was kicking my bike pedals. Definitely not recommended for beach cruisers. The seat did survive a couple of falls down the stairs, and a 7 year old using it as a doll high-chair."
4,Beginning of it All fo for me,"This was the very first large romance that I read (I think I was 12) and I had only read the small, thin harlequins up to that point. I loved this book and I have never forgotten it, in addition to the author that started me on my 4 romance books a week habit (350+ pages each). (Hey, I get some great pointers...) I like being able to read something and can say, ""Yeah, we do that"" (smile). I would love to be able to get this book so that I can have it as a keepsake."
4,Works well,I purchased this second battery as a backup for overseas trips. It carries a charge that is 2-3 times longer than the original battery that came with my IPAQ.No problems in the 3 months I've owned it.
1,Lenny sucks frog feet!,I really dislike Lenny's use of the word dragonfly. Obviously he has no respect for insects. Without insects this world would be a disaster. No food for fish means no food for eagles which means no food for me. Wait a second. I am not allowed to eat eagles.
4,MILLER MFG. 30X30 RABBIT HUTCH,"this cage is not what I expected...it's way bigger & better than I expected it to be. I have to admit though, when I put this together, all 6 pieces of it, I put it together wrong...what I mean is there is an inside & an outside to every panel...I put the outside on the inside & thus made it harder on myself to put this cage together. THIS IS NOT THE MFG.CO. FAULT....it is my fault.if there is anything I would find fault with about this hutch or cage, it is lack of details in the instructions sheet. They included pictures of how it is to be put together, but the pictures are not enough. They need more text type details."
1,This book is not updated. Many names dont exist any more.,"What have the frommers done is Just duplicating the old edition with a new name. This so called 2001 edition "" frommer's hong kong 6th eddition"" has so many names I could not look up on the internet mainly because they were sold to another company with a different name. The air lines they suggested dont even fly to hong kong any more. Many restaurants were nonexistant. Things are changing rapidly in Hong Kong. Frommers has not kept up with those changes. Seems like a [price] rip off scam to me.Good luck."
4,Useful look at Roosevelt as a person,Nathan Miller provides a refreshing narrative of FDR in his book an Intimate Life. Overall while there are some inaccuracies that other historians later disproved the views espoused here are sound and look at a different aspect than many FDR biographies do. Particularly with regard to Roosevelt's rise to power and his elections with his inner circle are detailed and thoughtfully discussed. While some may find the detail of his early life tiring it does do a lot to shape who he is as a person and provide insight into his later actions. In fact this is one of the best looks at Roosevelt as a person without elevating him to the godlike status that so many biographers do. If you are looking for a quick overview that looks at Roosevelt as a person and not just his time as president this is a good place to start but discount much of the Eleanor pages since that has largely been disproved.
5,Very Good Product,The cats loved this! It stays fresh in the container and is light enough to not spoil their regular feedings nor gain weight as I only need to give them a small bit to make them very happy!
2,My cats do not like it.,"I have two cats. Neither one of them are very picky, but they did not care for the bonita flakes."
1,Not a hit,I had seen a local rescue center feeds the cats these as a treat and the cats there went crazy over them. Well my catdidn't feel the same. I gave some to a friend who has cats and they didn't care for them either. I ended up giving therest of what I got to the rescue center.
1,My cat wouldn't eat it.,"Unfortunately my cat would not eat it. I don't think there is anything I can say after that, other than I'm very disappointed and now I have a tub of this stuff which I don't know what to do with. My cat isn't picky about which food she eats and loves turkey and tuna from our plates so I'm surprised this didn't work for her. But I liked the packaging."
5,"My cat likes it, no surprise there","My cat did a double take after eating this for the first time. He went a little nuts trying to figure out how to get more.This stuff is expensive by the weight, but there's tons of flakes in the package. For the first week, I would only give my cat a few flakes, but it would take me forever to get through the whole container, so I started just pouring out a bunch into a bowl for him. It's pungent stuff, but that's how he likes it."
2,Dog-Man-Doo,"My cat will not touch it. He gives me a ""are you kidding me"" look. On the bright side, my dog likes them."
3,Kind of dry -- too doughy,"Either needs more filling or less cookie dough -- as the dough overpowers the filling, and the dough can really be ""heavy"" on the stomach.Although all ls forgiven when these Newtons are crumbled a bit, put in a bowl and covered with a generous dollop of Vanilla ice cream."
2,Plagiarism of the first order,"This book is a word-for-word copy of Richter's other book, ""Applied Microsoft .NET Framework Programming."" The few parts that are not copied directly from Richter's .NET book are copied from Balena's VB.NET book. Both of the sources for this book are rather mediocre, and their offspring is even worse."
2,Didn't Come with Plumbing Supplies,"This faucet is exactly what i wanted, but it didn't come with the complete kit so that it could be installed. What you see above the counter top is what you get with this set. I had to go to my local home improvement store and buy a moen faucet that was a different finish, just to get the necessary pieces to complete the installation."
1,NOT THE BOX SET,"I love Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I was eagerly looking forward to the receipt of my box set. Having seen (and coveted) the set on friends' bookshelves, I knew what it was supposed to look like. I thought for sure I had the right item here as the pictures matched what I wanted, and the description specified that there were 40 Discs (as opposed to the regular Complete Series, which only has 39, as it is lacking the disc of special features). The item I received in the mail is NOT the box set. It is not packaged all neatly with cool pictures and stuff. It does not have the letter from Joss Whedon. And it does not have the special 40th disc. Instead, it is just the sim DVDs of each of the seven seasons shoved together in a box. Additionally, it has quite a bit of wear & tear despite being, supposedly, new, so even if it had been what I ordered, I would have been displeased."
5,Perfect Tribute to a One of a Kind Series,There will never be another show like BtVS. Many will try and many will fail. I did not come to the show until Season 5. My very first experience with this show was Buffy vs. Dracula. Not the best introductory show as I had no idea how attached one could become to fictional characters. I caught up through FX and never looked back.This set brings together all the previous individual sets as well as some more extras. The box set is packaged beautifully and makes it convenient for you to find just the episode that you are looking for.This is a must-have for each and every BtVS fan.
5,One of the Best Series of all Time,"I have watched this series twice already on Netflix and absolutely love it. Each season is better than the ones that come before it. So why did I buy it if I can watch it on Netflix or Prime at anytime? Because I wanted to watch the special features. Because I wanted to travel with the disks and to watch the show with friends and family. Because when the power goes out and my laptop has enough charge to watch a DVD, this is what I want to watch. This is a fantastic complete series for an excellent price. Any Joss Whedon fan who has not watched this is missing out."
2,"Buffy is flawless, the DVD packaging is not","I am a huge fan of this series so my review has nothing to do with BtVS but has everything to do with the packaging.The first set I received was crushed and mangled. It rattled when I picked up the box. Amazon replaced it. I watched happily, (in spite of the poor video quality on the 1st season DVD) until today when the last disc of Season 4 was so badly scratched it was unplayable. I'm checking the other discs to see if they'll play, but, according to the customer service rep who responded to my email inquiry, the set has widespread problems. Fox will replace it, but only after you send in the damaged disc, they examine it and determine whether or not to charge you $6.99 for it's replacement.This is all a real disappointment. Has anyone else out there had similar problems?"
3,GREAT! But some discs don't work!,"My Husband gave me this complete set as a Christmas gift. I was so excited...until I got to season 3 and two discs didn't work. I immediately started playing them all and found similar non-readable discs in seasons 4,5,& 6. My husband emailed Amazon immediately, but was told that it was past the date for exchange due to defect.This was a lesson learned: Even if your purchase is a gift, OPEN IT! Make sure all of the discs work or you will be stuck having to purchase whole seasons for just one disc.The extras in this set are awesome!"
4,Neat but not functional,"My husband bought this for me for Christmas because it was cheaper than buying the rest of the individual Seasons. The packaging is very cool looking, but the cases are stacked on top of each other making it harder to get to the ones on the bottom. There is one book with all the episodes listed instead of seven different ones. Other than the disc of extras that is in here (and not in the indivdual seasons) and the packaging, I haven't noticed anything special. If you already own all seven seasons I personally don't see a reason in spending the extra money just for a fancy box that isn't really user friendly. If you don't own any and are looking to own all the seasons this is a good deal. I love the show and whould have given it five stars if the box wasn't set up the way it is."
4,"Great show, shoddy packaging","I was never a fan of the show until 2 years ago when a friend introduced it to me. I became instantly hooked and excited to find out this box set was being released. The show is great, Joss Whedon is a creative genius, and a part of me hopes that there will be more in the future from this universe.However, like someone else said here, buyer beware. I was disappointed to open and find my set damaged in various places. The cardboard is really weak and there are creases on the outer box itself as well as the dvd holders. One of the seasons didn't even open since it had been glued to together, so it ripped when I pryed it open. Plus, one of the plastic holders was chipped and cracked.So, this could have been a really nice set. If you do order this, be prepared to possibly find it damaged or try to buy it from another source that handles their products better."
5,The best deal for Buffy fans,"I was never really a big fan of the show until a friend of mine started showing it to me from the beginning. By the time I was in season 3 I decided that I needed to buy it. This is a great deal because it is much cheaper than buying each individual season. Before I started watching this show I was a huge X-Files and Alias fan. I still love both of those shows, but have since added Buffy to the mix. The show has great story lines and characterizations. This is one of the best investments I have made in DVDs."
5,I don't have a title for this.,I know this is a reviews section but why do some of you lay the blame for this collection at Joss Whedon's feet? He doesn't own the show. He just made it. The only people to blame is 20th century Fox .
4,I'll wait,"I already own all seven seasons on DVD and the show very good, with the exeption of the latter two seasons.If you don't already own any of the DVDs this might be for you.I myself will wait for the comming format wars to end before I upgrade my collection"
5,Tiffany J,A must have for all Buffy fans. It's great that all 7 seasons come compact and neat in this set. Seasons 2& 3 are by far the best! Season 5 is a great follow up and finally season 7 redeems the show after a horrible season 6. I'm so glad I bought this so I dont have to borrow different seasons from my friend when I need a quick Buffy fix!
5,"The best, much?","----------------------------------------------------------""Buffy The Vampire Slayer: The Complete Series""----------------------------------------------------------A couple of years ago I was walking around talking about how ""The Wire"" was the single best TV show ever. However, I recently re-watched the entire run of Buffy The Vampire Slayer for the first time since the shows broadcast, and boy, does that show still live up to my fond memories. ""The Wire"" is Shakespeare great, but ""Buffy"" rocks: comedy, pathos, horror and some delightful, wildly creative premises and great ensemble acting - Joss Whedon is a frickin' genius. I look forward to checking back in with the Scooby Gang in another eight years, when my kid is old enough to watch it too. (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain/Slipcue film reviews)"
5,Well it's Buffy of course it's awesome,Been a huge fan of Buffy for awhile it was surprisingly cheap for the whole set I think I spent under 70 but as far as box sets go this one isn't all that spectacular apart from the box that holds them all together other than that all the inner cases look the same as buying them individually and there aren't anymore special features or anything kind of a let down but I'm just glad I own them all now
5,A Chilling Follow-up,"Every cop needs a witch for a partner, and there's no witch better than Rowan Gant. When two deaths are tied to a serial rapist, Detective Ben Storm seeks the aid of St. Louis' resident witch. But when a spirit of one of the dead women starts to subject herself into Row's dreams and waking life, it's enough to coax even a witch to seek help. The author's description of Row's channeling of the dead makes this third installment in the series the best yet."
3,Good...Not Bad,"I decided to read this book after watching the movie, ""Monster"", an account of Aileen Wuornos. I was not disappointed. I believe the book transmitted a rather unbiased story about the life of Aileen. The initial portion of the book throws out lots of names and it takes several pages until the names start to sink in with respect to who's who. The portion of the book dealing with the case was a bit boring and too long. And, I was not very interested in the author's psychoanalysis of Aileen. However, the book is a very good crime novel up until it gets bogged down in her trial."
2,"Jumbled prose, impossible to read","Sue Russel may have spent a lot of time researching Aileen Wuornos' life, too bad she didn't spend enough time putting all the facts together to make a readable narrative. I saw the movie, ""Monster,"" and wanted to know more. I'm thankful I got the book through the library and didn't waste my money on a book that I've decided to give up after 125 pages.As for Aileen Wuornos, she was a damaged person. Sometimes damaged people go on to inflict damage."
3,Emotionally lacking plot.,"Rutger played his role well, but I found no emotional engagement with ANY of the people portrayed. The movie is about post-modern age where instead of gladiators, some people voluntarily play a very violent game. While the game shows graphic scenes of beating and some bloodletting it certainly doesn't engage in the over use of splattering blood. It is rather dour and it's hard to feel any connection with the players, even Rutger. The acting is very good but the plot needs something."
3,Classic B Movie not so good transfer.,If you never saw this movie its a must for the post apocolyptic feel good sports movie. Its the best one evermade.However the transfer that came with this DVD I would rate poor. I'm not a video phile but any dark scenes got really dark. I've seen this movie many times on VHS so I know it looked better then it did on this DVD. Still beggers can't be choosers its still a good movie.
1,Disappointed,The quality of this DVD is horrible! It looks like someone copied it off an old VHS tape in the garage for 5 bucks... there are obvious rolling lines during the darker scenes (quite a few in this movie) and the audio is almost mute unless you crank your TV up beyond reasonable levels. I was hoping for a good copy of a favorite movie... still looking after returning this twice... I suggest you look elswhere.
3,Great for smaller cars!,"I bought this carseat for my second car, because after spending almost $200 on my daughters Eddie Bauer seat, we found out it doesn't fit, rearfacing, in the back of our two door car, however it is awesome in our SUV! I chose this seat, because the design of it is so much like our other one, yet it is more compact. We have found, that the buckle is to low... it pinches little legs. Most carseats, the buckle sits right below the belly button,but this one doesn't. She is only 9 months old now, so she hasn't complained about it yet, but I am worried that as she gets older, if she wears shorts or dresses, she will be uncomfortable. My only other complaint is that the pattern is not very appealing and it is the only one available at this time!"
3,Shipping issues,I live in Hawaii and they won't let me purchase this item that I can't find anywhere on the Island. Although in the fine print it says they can send Baby Items to Hawaii and this particular item is for the SAFETY OF MY BABY. Please send this to me
4,Entertaing movie.,Enjoy Reese Witherspoon in anything and she did not disappoint. Loved watching via the Kindle. It was great to be able to order thru Amazon and see it instantly.
4,Love the chemistry,I'm a big Tom Hardy fan so this was a must see for me. I was not disappointed at all. I love Reese Witherspoon. It was a great story line and great acting. A must see.
5,The best movie!,The movie was very funny and had good acting. Good plot and it is totally worth the money. It's the type of movie you can watch over and over!
1,Boring,"I love Tom Hardy, especially in Wuthering Heights. This movie, however, was more than disappointing. I hope he picks a better movie project next time. Go Tom!!!"
4,This Means War Purchased on Amaon.com,"As buddy-buddy pictures go, ""This Means War,"" reminded me of Running Scared, with Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines because of the banter between the Pine and Hardy. I found the movie to be funny, action-packed, and I loved the chemistry between Reese Witherspoon and her two handsome on-screen suitors. The actors were completely believable. It was a romp; light and funny, and just the type of movie you want to see on a Friday night after a stressful week at work. Loved It."
3,"Funny, but not a keeper","I won't go into plot details you can read for yourself, but I will say the whole ""bad guy"" storyline of the movie was WAY too light. I understand it's supposed to be a sort of a romantic comedy/buddy flick, and it's not bad in THAT department, but the sub-plot was beyond ridiculous, as I think you only ever saw the actual bad guy for MAYBE ten minutes in the entire movie. Still, I call it above average for the simple fact the funniest parts of the movie weren't necessarily shown in the trailer. A solid 3 stars."
4,Good action movie but a bit long overall,The movie trailer seems awesome. The beginning of the movie kept my attention and then about halfway it was almost painful to watch. But the ending of the movie was very good.
4,Tom Hardy,"I only like this movie for one reason, and one reason only...and that is the brilliance of Tom Hardy! If this was the first movie you ever saw with this man in it, you would never know what an amazing actor he is! He is smoking hot in this particular movie, and that's what I love most about it. But watch ""Bronson"" or ""Warrior"" after this, and you will realize he is no joke. He is AMAZING. He is truly a chameleon, who knows how to act. And that voice. Oh, that voice. OK, that's my review on Tom Hardy...or uhhh, errr....""This Means War."" Hope you guys enjoy it."
5,Love this movie,This is a really cute and fun movie. Picture quality is excellent of course and I love the digital copy to put on my iPad for traveling.
3,More or less ok,"I like Tom Hardy. I like Chris Pine. I even like Reese Witherspoon. You would think this would be a good movie with these great actors, but it's not very good. The don't do a good job with character development, character chemistry, and the plot is downright cheasy. However, this is a stepping stone movie for these two dudes."
4,fun movie,"I thought this was a cute movie. Sure, it's not the best one around, but movies like these serve a purpose when you just want to relax and suspend disbelief for a little while. Plus, Tom Hardy is easy on the eyes...and the chemistry between him and Chris Pine was better than either men with Reese Witherspoon."
2,Pretty standard,"I love Reese Witherspoon, so that tempted me to pay the $1.99 to rent this online. It might have been worth $1.75. :) Reese is wonderful Chelsea Handler's character was hideous and crude - and very much like Ms. Handler I believe. The two guys were adequate. But there is nothing memorable or truly enjoyable about the entire movie. I really don't enjoy watching Reese in heavy love scenes. I'd rather enjoy her sparkling acting instead."
2,A bit lacking,"Though this goes by quickly, I found little to recommend it. Reese Witherspoon is past her prime as a love interest and is obviously older than the two young starlets assigned here to try to woo her. The core of the film is dated: internet dating as something weird. Dear Hollywood: it's been going full force for over a decade. Some fun capers as the two CIA agents deal with various bad guys in totally implausible ways. Otherwise, take a pass."
1,A real disappointment,"I saw this movie at a bargain theater for $2.50, and felt I overpaid! It didn't help that for some reason it was kind of fake looking (can't be sure whether it was the source or not), very strange. But worse than that, the whole thing felt fakey. I give a lot of grace to rom coms, and don't think there's a thing wrong with escapism, but this movie failed to reach even my two-star minimum standards. The biggest fault is that I didn't care about the characters, or which guy won the girl. That's a death knell in a rom com. The action was ok, but not enough to save the movie. And the best friend? I can't believe the obnoxious characters who pass for friends in quite a few movies lately, and they don't even make me laugh. As they say, With friends like that....And just to compare to another romance/action movie I did enjoy, take a look at Knight and Day. That was like a fun ride at an amusement park, and done a lot better."
1,Was painful to watch,"My husband and me decided to watch something light and how we thought funny that night, but unfortunately this movie was extremely dull and predictable... Very untalented work."
4,Pretty Comical!,If you don't laugh at this movie there is definitely something wrong with you! All the bad reviews are nonsense and are most likely from a bunch of idiot couch potato males. The movie was alright. It was very funny. I laughed a lot. Anyone with a sense of humor would like this movie.
3,Kind of funny,It was kind of funny but nothing great. You figured out the ending before it ended so I could have turned it off a half hour before it ended
3,An Eye Candy Binge,"I heart these boys. Hardy and Pine are every bit as delicious as expected. But after the first half hour or so, I had no problem wandering away and getting a real snack. This movie has a 7-layer dip identity crisis (romantic comedy, buddy flick, chick flick, spy vs. spy action thing) with no single element really delivering the goods. No surprises; no plausible spark between any of the characters. We can tell the guys were aiming for the quippy Clooney/Pitt screen sizzle, or at least some of the old Martin/Sinatra sass. No luck. In fact, FDR's shallow, not-quite-reformed playboy thing got old very fast. I kept waiting for Witherspoon's character to turn out to be a double-agent hired by the base-jumping German guy to get the boys to kill each other. In the end, I wished they'd given Chelsea Handler a lot more screen time. Unfortunately, the best thing about this movie is the poster."
4,"Ridiculous premise, but fun anyway!","It's a very silly premise, really: two CIA agents, best buds, fighting over the same girl? But I still found it rather entertaining for what it was. Action scenes were fun and I liked the banter between the two male leads. Reese Witherspoon was alright. The chemistry in general was pretty nice, though most of the story was rather predictable. Honestly, most people I think would give it 3 stars, but I think this is a movie I would enjoy seeing more than once, verging on guilty pleasure for liking it so much, which is why I bumped it up to a 4 star rating."
5,Great movie,It is great. Why do I have to write a certain amount of words? It is annoying really really it is!
2,"Beginning was funny, then slowly got ruined.","The movie started off funny, but towards then it just got worst and worst and the end...at least in my sister's and I opinions was really lame and, of course, predictable. It definitely had it's good moments, though. Really light watch and no much substance to it, but I wouldn't reccommend it as a date movie. Disliked the ending."
4,A GOOD TIME,"What's wrong with just going to a movie to be entertained and have a good time? It was refreshing to laugh, not take anything too seriously, no pathos or crying, I really enjoyed it. Mindless yes but for 2 hours I had a GOOD TIME!"
1,Waste of Money. Want a Refund.,"This was the biggest joke ever because I've been wanting this movie since it came out, so I decided to buy it. The shipping was great because I got it two days after I ordered it. That's the only good part though because when I wanted to watch it it was scratched to no end and skipped and froze. I would love to get my money back or get this replaced because I don't like paying money for junk."
5,so worth the blu-ray,perfect description of the movie. this is one of those movies where it is a much better idea to pick up the blu-ray versus the regular dvd
2,not real compelling,"I would rate this a 2. I did watch the thing tho, hoping the story would get better. Actors not bad to look at though."
1,Reluctant Saint,"Right title, wrong Saint - my mistake. Not worth the money or time. Comments by professors, etc, added nothing. Negativity not appreciated. Ususlly I forward books, DVDs etc to family, but this one I will trash - not worth the postage."
3,CAUTION! If your child has an active imagination...,"We love these books on CD. However, the story titled, ""Cat and Mouse in a Haunted House"" has completely freaked out my 5 1/2 year old and he is unable to sleep because he is so spooked by this story. Perhaps skip this particular story and save yourself the sleepless nights if you have a child who tends to get scared easily."
1,I could not believe this was a Harlan Coben book.,"I was so excited to see a Harlan Coben book I had not read yet but once I started reading it I could not believe he wrote it. Only when I went back to the review page today did I notice that he wrote it a very long time ago. I guess that explains why it was not up to par with this more recent books. I am having a hard time even finishing it. All of his more recent books I finish in 1 or 2 days. He is one of my favorite authors. If this is his first book, written while he was in his 20's, well I give him a pass because every other book I have read of Harlan's is excellent."
3,Fabric Glossary (4th Edition) Review,"Although this book was very helpful in describing the different fabric types, it is pretty useless without the Fabric Swatch Set. Every page has a place to paste each corresponding fabric swatch to match up with the descriptions and if you do not have that, it is difficult to know how each fabric piece compares to the next. Example: there are several types of silks, but if you do not have the actual samples with you, you can not tell the difference between their actual feel or weave.Also, another thing to know is that each page is photo-copied so all of the fabric picures are in black and white. It is hard to see details because of this.BOTTOM LINE: You difinitely need the Fabric Swatch Set to use this book efficiently."
4,Acting good,Story line was good. It could have used better transitions from sceen to sceen. I liked the WWJD aspect best.
4,Good flick,I really enjoyed this video. The message comes across pretty clear and the mentoring of this young fellow is a very positive moral message.
4,A birthday present,"This metal detector is the first we have owned. It was a birthday gift for my husband. It was fairly easy to assemble and get working. I actually went out in the back yard and buried several articles for him to find with his new ""toy"". They ranged in size and in composition. There was a key, a nail, and 4 pieces of small jewelry ranging from 10 to 18 carat gold. He found them all, easily. And actually, the machine indicated there were other things buried in places that I didn't put anything. We have yet to discover what is buried there. Very interesting!! A fun adventure. We live in California Gold country and intend to take it out to the rivers to see what we can find."
5,Wow! Really Beautiful!,This ring is beautiful. I returned it because it is too big/wide for my finger but the diamonds are an EXCELLENT quality. This ring is worth every penny.
3,Conventional but fun - very accessible,"Humorous, easy reading. The author falls on the slightly more conventional side of the grammatical fence (insisting, for example, that ""their"" is an incorrectly plural gender-neutral pronoun and should not be used as a singular) (I myself do not fall as conventionally and so found myself in disagreement upon several points--including this one). So far, I am reading it as I work out: I skim through the parts that are overly familiar (still written with humor so worth at least skimming), dwell on the points upon which I am less sure, and feel most pleased overall to have been reading it. An entertaining way to brush up on English grammar as we ought to have learned it in grade school. A most delicious ""spoonful of sugar"" for the ""medicine"" of grammatical review."
2,Is I Witless?,"I just suffered through 60 pages of this book, not once noticing the ""wit"" in it. ""Eats, Shoots and Leaves"" is witty; Stephen King's ""On Writing"" demonstrates why Stephen King is more than just another pretty face; and the ""Oxford Guide..."" by Kane is my naughty, punctuation favorite, but ""Woe is I,"" is, woe is me, boring. It had a plausible and different take than ""Eats, Shoots and Leaves"" about the proper use of apostrophes (not apostrophe's), but as it points out, ""who cares?""It might be blasphemy for me to quarrel with Garrison Keillor's opinion that this book is ""cool,"" and maybe my perceptions are attributable to differences between his taste and mine, but having given due consideration to that possibility, I deduce that GK wrote that to provide an excuse for his giving this book as gifts to people he hates."
4,THIS GAME IS THE BEST GAME TO BE EVER PLAYED ON THE GBA!!!!!,"COLIN MCRAE 2.0 FOR THE GBA IS THE FINEST VIDEO GAME TO BE PLAYED ON THE GBA. O.K. IT IS NOT THE SAME AS PLAYING IT ON THE CONSOLE BUT IT IS THE CLOSEST YOU WILL EVER GET. THE GRAPHICS ARN'T PERFECT, BUT THE GAMEPLAY WILL COMMAND OVER ANY GRAPHICS. FIRST OFF, IT USE A 3D ENGINE IN STED OF SPITES, WHICH GIVES THE CAR MOVEMENTS A HUGE BUST. MEANING IT PAYS CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE SUSPENTION AND THE CAR WILL WOBBLE LIKE IN REAL RALLY RACING. THE CAR ALSO GETS DIRTIER, THATS AN AWSOME FEATURE, AND BEFORE AND AFTER A RACE, YOUR CAR WILL HAVE TO GO IN FOR REPAIRS DO TO WHETHER CONDITIONS AND DAMAGE. OVER ALL I GIVE IT TEN STARS."
2,Not for the novice user,"First the good part - if you invest in Websphere Studio, Websphere App Server, UDB, Visual Age Java, and you are an accomplished Web professional, then you've got a complete environment for development and production. Throw in IBM's San Francisco and you've got half the work of creating a high-tech site done for you. Now the bad part - if you are not comfortable setting up app servers and SSL then you're not likely to be able to do this alone. While IBM is certainly available to help you implement a Websphere solution (for a fee!), a project on the Websphere platform is definitely not for the faint of heart. As for me, my company purchased the Websphere Suite 6 months ago and I just got the servers running reliably. I'm not looking forward to doing development on this platform."
4,Dwight Frye Is Great As Herman!!,This is a good movie about a town who has experienced some suspicious deaths that make it look like the work of a vampire or is it something else? I liked this mystery movie and I really liked Dwight Frye as the mentally challanged Herman.
3,B movie loaded up with stars,"I bought The Vampire Bat (1933) at Halloween City for 99 cents. I had heard of it before, but had never seen it. It's a B ""horror"" movie that's 64 minutes long and actually doesn't quite feel like a horror movie, but rather a mystery. It is loaded up with stars from that era, including Fay Wray (King Kong 1933, Mystery Of The Wax Museum 1933), Lionel Atwill (Mystery Of The Wax Museum 1933, Son Of Frankenstein 1939), Melvyn Douglas (Hud 1963, Being There 1979, The Changeling 1980), Dwight Frye, and Maude Eburne.This movie starts out pretty spooky, but then gets extremely talky. Basically it's about a small town where the residents start dying of blood loss. Vampirism is suspected. A serial killer stalks. It's quite campy. That's how a lot of old films are.Overall, it's an OK movie. It's not a must-have, but for fans of old movies maybe it is. It's black and white and standard full frame."
4,An inspirational compilation of modern female artists,"It has taken too long for a compilation of modern female artists for r&b, funk, and dance--finally somebody did it.There is widespread diversity of styles and time periods: everything from Donna Summer's ""Hot Stuff"" to Destiny's Child's ""no no no."" A nice mix over the ages.I certainly hope this series continues. Unfortunately, it appears ""Funky Divas 1"" is not available in the US. I bought this album in Singapore...Certainly worth getting."
2,Kinda Boring....,"I found the premise to this book very interesting, but the reality fell short. The hero is incapacitated and he and the heorine have little conversation/interaction for the first hundred or so pages of the book. To me, this is way too long particularly since the book itself was only 300-something pages....after that I started skimming, trying to get to some part where they interact and have a full conversation. Also, there were too many background characters. Normally, I like subplots and supporting characters, but these people were underdeveloped plot-devices and they got on my nerves after a while. In the end, I simply put the book down and never went back to it. Currently, it's in my stack to sell back to the bookstore."
2,All dressed up and nowhere to go,"I bought this game being a fan of White Wolf RPG's, but was pretty disapointed with this. On the plus side, the graphics and sound were both impressive. The level scenery was great and the bosses were creative, though not particularly challenging.Unfortunately, the greater part of the game is spent running around hacking apart endless hordes of nearly identical zombies. This goes on level after level with no real changes. I'd recomend renting it if your a White Wolf fan, you'll easily be able to beat the game before you have to take it back. I can't imagine wanting to play it again after you've beaten it once."
1,no fun at all,"we all play halo for hours on end at work and i was looking for another 4 player game and this seemed like the a great choice based on all the reviews i read. so the four of sit down and try playing for about 15 minutes, decide the game is simple, boring and you just pull the triggers alot and kill numerous zombies, it takes no skill. we turned it off and started playing halo again."
1,WHY? WHY?,"Why did Hunter The Reckoning dissapoint? My friends and I couldn't wait for this game to hit stores, and 15 minutes into the game we couldn't wait to switch back to HALO. Many zombies, great graphics, but unfortunately thats pretty much it. The game gets repetitive and you are special if you can tell one zombie from the other. If you are looking for a 1-4 player or co-op mode in a game I recommend Halo 1st, then Gauntlet before Hunter the Reckoning."
2,Disappointing...,"Even with no hype-fueled expectations, I was still let down by this game. The developers immediately seem to get defensive by actually stating on a load screen that 70,000 man-hours went into the development of this game. It doesn't show. I'm not a big fan of the horror/action genre. Even so, I know a good game when I see one. 'Resident Evil 2' was a good game. If you mixed equal parts of Resident Evil, Gauntlet, and frustratingly bad game play, you'd have 'Hunter: The Reckoning."" The angles from which you view the action are awkward. Game play doesn't flow very well. You'll probably spend plenty of time running around trying to figure out where to go next, which wouldn't be bad if the environment was entertaining enough to want to explore. As it is, it resembles a 3-D version of a 2-D cartoon scroller with the same background cell recycled over and over."
2,"Had alot going for it, but that's not saying much.","I bought this game. It had a good start with the cutscene at the beginning. It really had an interesting plot: A prison is torturing inmates by experimenting on them or something so they come back from the dead and try to kill off the town, along with other creatures working with them. The game also had a dark atmosphere and that's a high point. Unfortunately, most of the levels require you to kill zombies and rescue people. Because of this, the game gets old. I actually enjoyed the cutscenes more than playing! What could have been a great game is destroyed by pointless objectives and the storyline is ignored."
2,Boring!!!,"This game is hours of mindless frustration, and boredom. If you don't love slasher films, this game is gonna [stick]! The camera angle is terrible and you have no control over it, which makes aiming nearly impossible. The bad guys(zombies with guns)pop out of nowhere continuously like Night Caster, and i have OFTEN gotten so many enemies on the screen that the game bogs down. While the glorious xbox does its best to make the game pretty the animation is terrible, and cut scenes look like the PS one. All in all this game isn't worth [the price]. Hang onto your money and wait for the price to come down-way down-like used. Or buy a good game, HALO,JSRF,Gotham Racing,GunValk,BloodWake. Im taking mine back today."
1,Take your money and flush....,"Listen people take your money that could buy this game, and flush it down the toilet, cause it would be better spent. This is one of the WORST 10 XBOX games that has ever been created so far. I mean it seems alright at first. Then you get to playing it and there are more and more enemies, until you're extremely out-numbered. Than you die and its hard to earn more lives. Then the story line just seems to disapear for a while. This game is POSSIBLY worth thinking about renting, MAYBE! But I would'nt even rent this game if I would have know how bad it is."
1,Horrible multi-player experience,"I thought that this game would be a great coorperation play game with a twist like Resident Evil. However, I found that this game was horrible in the multiplay arena. The game was easier (and slightly more fun) to play one player. There were way too many times when one player would get killed because another player was accidently trapping them.When will companies come to the conclusion that sharing the same screen just doesn't work on multi-player? Split it up and allow each user to move freely!"
4,"Good, but needs work!!!","Good, but needs work! Hunter The Reckoning is fun but I strongly suggest you rent it before you buy it! The game is a bit disapointing.You can't aim your weapon up or down and chose whatlimb you will blow off and the graphics in gameplay are o...kbut could be better. On other hand the in game movies' graphics are pretty good. I have not beaten the game yet but I think it will keep me playing. out of 10 I would give this game about 5.5 to 7.5. The only really disapointing thing is that you can't aim your weapon up and down, and the enemies bodies disapear when killed."
2,only somewhat helpful,"The general problem with Arabic texts is that there are not many good options out there. Supplemental books, such as the '201 Verbs', is ok, but it quickly loses the average student who is unfamiliar with what the meaning of the 'jussive' verb form is in English.I wish there would be a listing of the verbs in English as well. They are in alphabetical order in Arabic, something that is only of limited help. The need for better Arabic texts is very high. An overhaul of this book would be much appreciated."
3,...eh,"i love delirious...from their worship albums to their secular side...but this album was, well, not their best. i'm not talking about lyrically or spiritually, but musically. i honestly think they were trying too hard to get a pop sound, and the great musical sounds fans are accustomed to hearing have left them. however, the sound is still decent, so i would recomment this album."
3,Not As Great As They Used To Be But Still Good,"This CD is not bad just not what I expected. There was a time that Delerious? was THE sound of progressive worship. This CD takes more of a performance feel. The new songs are good but more gray than their early work in regards to their faith. The enhancements are not all that great either. I did enjoy the retro D cd that came with it, I just wish this album sounded more like those classic tunes. Again, this isn't bad but if you are expecting to find the awesome worship tunes that once defined them, this is not it."
4,Funny Funky Herdmans,The Herdmans are funny funky and a little bit disturbed.They smoke and always doing somthing mean.The Herdmans are the funniest family.one time they tatooed Louella`s brother.It`s a good book just not four stars. So get ready for the four star rateing and read the best school year ever and the second best book ever. bykate
3,A Handful of Action,"If you are looking for a funny book, I have one for you! It's called, The Best School Year Ever. In the book there are these Herdmans, and they do all of this mean, bad, and crazy stuff! For example, the Herdmans washed their cat in the..........Read the boook to find out that and the rest of the funny stuff in this book!!!!"
1,The Best Book Ever,"Do you like funny books? This book is about the Herdmans and they do crazy things during the year. For example, they steal baby Howard and tattooed him! There's six Herdmans that cause trouble."
3,"Cornfed is interesting, but the author doesn't deliver.","The book is a sensationalist work, the dog mauling story could have been told in a few chapters so it's no wonder why the author digresses and focuses on Paul ""Cornfed"" Schneider.Cornfed is a figure that will be remembered as one of the greatest arch-criminals of the present era. Jones' potrait of Cornfed falls short of the necessary detail, due, no doubt, to her inability to obtain information about this modern day criminal mastermind, but the book gives the reader enough so they are begging to know more about Cornfed -whom Jones calls our modern day ""Hannibal Lecter.""A crazy story that contains numerous distortions and facts that arguably contrary to the truth, but once again these facts will, no doubt help sale The Red Zone. So, purchase it if think you might want to read about Cornfed our modern day Lex Luther."
2,On and on and on and on and on,"I was so excited to finally get a chance to read this book as I was looking forward to learning more about Diane Whipple and her LIFE. Boy, was I disappointed. There is very VERY little information about Diane Whipple and most of the book centers of Paul Schneider, who started the business with the dogs. And, comparing him to Hanibal Lecter? What?? It doesn't even make sense. This book rambles on and on and on about nothing, really, and I was very disappointed to see that it was written by Aphrodite Jones, whom I normally like to read. Had I known that those from Diane's side of the story didn't cooperate, I would have never picked up the book. Save your time."
2,The Fruitcake Zone,"This is by far the greatest disappointment of my summer reading books. Is this book about how the corrupt California Corrections System operates and allows incarcerated members of the AryanBrotherhood to run illegal attack-dog kennels outside of prison while they are still in prison? Or is this book about semi-retarded individuals who live in fear of giant, vicious dogs but can't bear to part with them because they have become so ""attached"" to these maniacal animals? I thought RED ZONE would deal with the death and trial of Ms. Whipple. The first two chapters were fascinating, but once the focus shifted to Paul Schneider and the ""girlfriends"" he set up to raise his dogs, the book should have been given a different title."
1,Poor research and profiting off a persons death,This book does little more then regurgitate what was already printed in newspapers and other articles. Were the Autopsy photos necessary? The Author has also done no research into the breed of dogs involved. Its pure sensationalistic clap trap.
3,Fatal Dog Attacks by such dogs as the Presa.,"Sensational and perpetuates some myths regarding Guard Dogs such as Pit Bulls, Presas, and Rottweilers . In addition, the Red Zone appears to malign some Presa Dog Breeders in the USA and Canada. For a more balanced view of the qualites, temperament, and photos oF Presas and or those considering one I would strongly recommend Manuel Curto Gracia Book entitled: Perro de Presa Canario who is a breeder from the Canaray Islands and expert on this breed."
1,Don't Read If You Have Health Anxiety!,"I have panic disorder which has caused heart anxiety. The very first pages of this book are SCARY. They talk about real and fatal physical problems that can cause symptoms like Panic Disorder before they even talk about Panic Disorder.They do nothing to reassure readers that if they have had a diagnoses of Panic Disorder that the symptoms truly are just nervous symptoms. In fact, this book even goes so far as to talk about the amount of people that have had severe heart problems that are misdiagnosed with Panic Disorder! Now why in the world would you do that to a group of people that are well known for having a health anxiety?If you are agoraphobic and do not have health anxiety issues then maybe this book might be okay but then again,I suspect that if you didn't have health anxiety before you read it, that you may have health anxiety by the time you reach the end of chapter one.I wish I had never bought it!"
2,it didn't help my mother,"My mother has been suffering from anxiety attacks for several months and I got her this book thinking it would help her understand things better -- unfortunately, I think the way the book goes into the details of having an anxiety attack was too much for her and she started having more of them. She wasn't able to go beyond a certain point in the book and I told her not to bother.My mother will be 80 in January, and these attacks scare her quite a bit (plus, she lives alone). I wouldn't argue the benefit the book may have had for other people, but I certainly think it's not going to be a ""one size fits all"" and much will have to do with the reader's personal situation and state of mind. Caution should probably be followed re: puchasing this book in situations involving the elderly and an already ""fragile"" mindset."
5,must buy,"I used this book and Reid Wilson's tapes to learn to manage anxiety attacks. Now, six months later, I am off medication and manage the occasional panic on my own. This is an invaluable book."
1,Did not like this book at all,"I started to get a panic attack reading this book. The begining of the book just keeps going into detail about panic, panic, panic, panic, symptoms, panic, more symtpons, more details of panic, every other sentence has the word panic, dizzy, nervousenes, more nervousnes, fear, terrified, hurt, more hurt, more panic. When you read this book these words just get pounded into your head and pretty soon you feel like your going to get another episode just reading this detailed negativity. I retuned the book immediatly."
5,Escape from Alcatraz,"one of my favorite clint movies, very suspenseful, easy to watch, my only beef is that the escape felt too easy.."
4,"Fine movie, with some dramatic license taken....","Clint Eastwood made a fine thriller, and it is a very accurate portrayal of what life on Alcatraz was like. However, I was disappointed to find out the movie was not historically accurate in several respects. If you want the real story, read ""Breaking The Rock"" by Jolene Babyak, who is the daughter of the associate warden at the time of the break."
1,Video,The tape would not play at first. After some coaxing it played one time then locked and could not be rewound. Was only good for one showing.
2,No no no no,"Hated this book. Just hated it. I love most of Jude's books but this one was a huge disappointment. First, the romantic lead. He's a big, sulking bully. He spanks his wife. Seriously, he puts her over his knee and spanks her because he doesn't like the way she is acting! Give me a break. Second, the couple just fights fights fights. We're supposed to believe this couple who cannot have a civil conversation loves one another? No way.Just skip this one."
2,big disappointment,"So let me get this straight -- Raine is the sweetest, most caring, sensitive guy in Velvet Promise and Highland Velvet...but then the minute he meets and marries Alyx, he turns into some jealous psycho for half the book?Riiiiiiiiiight.Alyx is the only thing that saved this one."
3,"nostalgic series, funnest of the three","When I first started reading romance novels, this series was one of my favorites. Possibly, it was also a forerunner for series about brothers.The last one was the one that I remember as the funniest thanks to the heroine being disguised as a boy and the hero trying to toughen her up for her own good."
5,Excellent insight into a brilliant pianist,I thoroughly enjoyed this series of glimpses into the life of an artist who is still relatively unknown because of her dislike of public solo performances.
2,Not Unified Process,"If you are looking for a book on the Unified Process (as I was), then this book is not for you. This book covers the author's Iconix process. Considering the book's title I would have expected it to examine use cases and UML more than it does.I was really intereted in the Unified Process. But, the Iconix methodology is a good one, and were it to be more prevalent in the industry I would take a harder look at it."
2,Great potential cut short,"This movie had all the potential to being one of the great tiny people movies but came up short, pun intended. The doll maker was not evil and even a bit likeable; his main reason for creating live dolls was because he was lonely. No thrills, no near deaths, no real reason for this movie even though it had lots of potential it didn't take advantage of anything that would have made me want to see it again. The cop was told several times what the old man was doing and never once came close to believing. The ending left you feeling like they just gave up on this idea and called it a day. It's worth a look but don't get your hopes up."
5,Very good!,"The Tenth Anniversary book is very good. Watterson shares his thoughts on many of his favorite Calvin and Hobbes strips, and gives a wealth of information on the behind-the-scenes life of a cartoonist in general, and on the development of C&H as characters and as a strip, specifically. His commentary on conflicts with newspapers and syndicates are intelligent and straightforward, and the book is a must-have for any C&H fan. Oh, yeah -- and the funnies are great, too. ;)"
1,I didn't buy this product,My review here is worth nothing because I do not remember buying this. Maybe I bought it for a friend and just forgot about it. Please do not rely on my review for this product.
1,There's no music on this disc,There's no music on this disc. It's mainly a British narrator talking all through the disc. There's very few interviews on the disc. A very disappointing discovery for the listener.
1,come what may get on your nerves,"This song sounds ok the first couple of times you hear it, but then your co-worker plays it day in, day out repeatedly. If you like the song and plan on only playing it occasionally, then I would recommend it; otherwise forget about it because your co-worker will play it for you anyway."
2,NOT COMFY,"This play yard is very expensive and has a lot of options, many I feel most people won't use, but maybe that's just me? I liked the pattern and the changing pad that could be moved out of the way instead of those that completely remove and you have to find a place to put them while using it as a bassinet.HOWEVER . . .this is the only place my now 5 week old CANNOT sleep. The pad is too big for the area it's meant to fit in. The sleeping pad is bent downwards in the middle, I try to lie her in it the short way, like the picture someone posted above, but she won't fit there long. I can see how a mattress could be uncomfy even for an infant. She sleeps fine in her crib and all other places we place her. I also think putting a sheet on it is SO hard, because they made the bassinet part rounded on the corners, for no significant reason.I would NOT recommend this play yard."
4,great game to play with friends,"i recently got this GVD and I must say it is quite addictive, it allows you to show off our knowledge of diiferent movies, but without being a know it all... it really allows a group of people just to waste a whole night joking around..grab some pizzas and friends and have a cool party night..."
1,GABA doesn't cross the BBB,"GABA doesn't cross the blood brain barrier; therefore, I have to say that many who are having good experiences with this product are likely experiencing a placebo effect. That being said, even if it is just a placebo, at least it's doing something for you. I've heard that Picamilon can cross the BBB, though I haven't done the research to find out yet. Picamilon is GABA bound to a niacin and is used to relieve various ailments. I'm going to give it a try as I've tried GABA because of all the good reviews, thinking maybe if I took enough some would cross the BBB. I noticed absolutely nothing after taking it for a month and will not waste another penny on it."
3,"not really worth it, but it sort of works","I was having bad panic attacks and I read this might calm me down. Well, it sort works and sort of doesn't.After the first day I noticed a mild calming effect. Enough to relax and not feel so tense. This surprised me as I wasn't expecting much. As I kept taking - and taking about 3 pills a day - I noticed the effect diminishing.It still seems to work, but doesn't last long. Maybe 3-4 hours at best. Then I am restless and anxious all over again. I hate Valium. I just wanted a mild calm, not to feel sleepy. I'll try Kava Kava and Passionflower next."
4,*Enjoyable*,"While there is some hokey stuff in this book and much of it is predicable, I still found it a quick, enjoyable read. Not much more I can say about this one."
2,"Ok, this is light reading but...",We were looking for something light for our book club after a series of intense novels. This certainly is light. There are strange leaps in the narrative. The author annoyingly lingers on food preparation instead of advancing the plot. A character figures menacingly and then disappears. Where was the editor?
1,Wrong product information.,"Correct tract list is as follows: 1) Don't Play Your Rock 'N Roll To Me, 2) Oh Carol, 3) For A Few Dollars More, 4) If You Think You Know How To Love Me, 5) Talking Her 'Round, 6) Wild Wild Angels, 7) Back To Bradford, 8) It's Your Life, 9) Needles And Pins, 10) Something's Been Making Me Blue, 11) Lay Back In The Arms Of Someone, 12) Living Next Door To Alice, 13) Baby It's You, 14) I'll Meet You At Midnight, 15) In The Heat Of The Night, and 16) Mexican Girl."
4,Something for everyone,"Whatever you're looking for, it's probably in here. I have returned to this book both when looking for a good read and when writing essays (for example on lesbian modernists): as well as having some wonderful stories spanning a broad range of styles, the introduction is damn good critical stuff and contains some very useful references. Thank goodness they've changed the cover; the previous edition featuring two half-naked women (whom you wouldn't want to run into on a dark evening) was somewhat embarrassing to be seen with at the university library.As well as enjoying the stories in their own right, I also found they led me to writers I hadn't encountered before. Some of my favourites include the extract from ""A Room of One's Own"", ""Lullaby for my Dyke and her Cat"" and ""The Secret of Sorrerby Rise"" (as well as the introduction to the book, funnily enough); and for all those Alison Bechdel fans out there, rest assured she's in there too."
3,Pretty good,Easy to install. Pretty loud audible alarm. There's nothing really to complain about. If you're looking for a basic audio alarm to put on doors or windows then you'll probably do pretty well with these.
2,Bulky and unillustrated,"I had high hopes for this guide given Frommer's reputation for quality guidebooks that are slightly more upmarket than Lonely Planet. But, the paper quality is like cheap paperbacks in checkout aisles, there are no illustations/photographs, and the writers insert too much of their personality and preferences in the writing (at times the guide reads like a feminist critique of Japan). And there are few maps, which were difficult to read (colors would have been nice)."
3,Enough of a guide for the short-hop traveller.,"Not a bad guide. Could be a little better on reviewing the history of the country and detailing the less travelled, but equally beautiful areas of Japan. Also I found cheaper options more plentiful than the book describes. But certainly enough for the short-time visitor."
4,Excellent and well used,"If you are going to Japan for a week or two on vacation, this is the one book you will need. Some go into much greater depth, but Frommer's provided me with plenty of options at all price catagories, all of which were excellent. By the end of the trip I didn't use my Lonely Planet guide any longer as I trusted the Frommer's guide. The size is easy to carry and the orgination makes it easy to quickly reference on the street. The only thing missing is better maps, but I traveled with one in addition to the guide to round out my trip. Well done."
4,Entertaining enough.,"Though not to say that this season wasn't any good, I have to say I prefer Season 1 to this. There's more romantic tension. It's just that I think the producers put them together too soon in Season 2 - they're always smooching. I'm watching season 3 now, it seems to be better.Don't be turned off by my comments though, there are some really great plots and scenes too in this season. That's why I'm giving it a four star."
3,"Only 3 Stars, for bad item description","This is a great Woody Allen film.However, it is only 85 minutes long, just like every other release.The description claims uncut 91 minute version. There is no extra material.It is widescreen, but I have to compare it side-by-side with a VHS version to acertain if making it widescreen cuts off the bottom and top of the picture.All special features are only written text and only in Korean, so virtually no special features unless you read Korean.Don't buy this because the description claims uncut version.It is not.It is, however, a really funny Woody film! Buy any domestic release."
3,Pant-wetter from Woody,"This is a classic Woody flick with great one-liners and physical bits. Best scenes--the chain gang, Woody playing cello in the marching band, his parents with the fake glasses and mustache, ""That says gun, not gub!"""
1,Take the Money & Run (Widescreen Edition),"I did not know ""widescreen"" meant digitally stretching (distorting) the film. I hope the artist Woody Allen never sees this thing. It is a disgrace to do such a thing to a wonderful film."
4,Comedy without errors,"This is the best of Woody Allen's strictly-for-laughs movies. The interview segments which he uses for both comedic and dramatic purposes in many of his films are probably the most fun here, particularly his ""parents"" who wear disguises. The gags are much better than in his ""Bananas"" and the more than slightly silly plot doesn't bog down as in his ""Sleeper"". There are no big moral soapboxes, this movie is just funny."
4,Classy debut,"Woody Allen stars and directs for the first time, and what a success it turns out to be. There are many great sight gags as well as the usual number of quality one-liners. The film is done in a documentary style, telling the story of Virgil Starkwell, an incompentent petty criminal, played by Woody of course.To pick a favourite moment out is difficult. However, if forced to pick one I'd go for the scene where Virgil tries to rob a bank, and fails because he hands over a note where the word gun can easily be mistaken for gub. Consequently the entire bank staff and customers are all arguing whether the word is gun or gub. Woody insists its gun; everybody else thinks its gub...This is definitely one of Woody's early funny ones!"
2,Take the Money and Run,"The DVD of Woody Allen's film ""Take the Money and Run"" was accessible on our computer, but it would NOT run on our TV. This was a great disappointment."
2,ABC VIDEO took the money and uhhhh...,"This ABC VIDEO tape of Woody Allen's TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN (1969) seems suspect. Although the back cover says it's a licensed product, I can't imagine why FOX would allow a company to sell really BAD copies of any of their catalogue.Further, ABC VIDEO is not affiliated with PARAMOUNT.The tape tracks well and has good HiFi audio, but it's all downhill from there. Recorded at the slowest speed, it's got a blurry picture that over-saturates with color. Had I known ABC VIDEO meant: crapola, I wouldn't have bought this doorstop, and humbly suggest that you don't either. Go with the1992 FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENTversion instead."
2,Couldn't wait for this movie to end,"I only bought this for the extra features and because Danny Trejo was in it. The movie itself is way too drawn out, has crummy color, and needs a lot more action. Also, many of the guns (especially some of the muzzle flashes) looked terribly fake."
1,Rip-Off,"IT doesn't work unless you purchase software for mega bucks to run with the external hard drive. This they don't tell you before you buy it. Also no way to return it. You just get screwed out of your money. You can phone them until you are blue in the face but nobody to talk to. Well it is external now, outside in my garbage can. Never again another Kanguru product. I find it hard to believe a number one company like Amazon would promote such a piece of worthless junk."
5,great Christian entertainment,"Great, clean, family entertainment. Funny, with a message we can all relate to. You won't be disappointed!"
5,good stuff,this saved me a lot of money instead of having to buy the same product from jegs. i like money and if you do too you should buy this product here and spend the left over cash on dinner for your wife. cheers
5,great locking lug nuts,"I bought these because I recently installed a set of aftermarket rims on my 06 corolla. I did strip the tool and one of the lug nuts when installing the last lug nut, but I emailed McGard and explained the situation and they sent me 2 replacement tools as well as a replacement lug nut for FREE! didn't even have to pay shipping.. all-in-all good product, and even better customer service!"
4,Gooseneck Diverter Faucet with hand shower for clawfoot tub.,I have an old clawfoot tub from the early 1900's that I had refinished and needed to find a faucet that would match its style. The satin nickel finish on this faucet is lovely and matches the other fixtures in the room very well. I love the antique telephone style. It fits the tub beautifully. It's easy to use and comfortable to hold. The handles are easy to operate and the transition from filler faucet to shower head is smooth.There was a small problem installing it because my supply lines didn't fiit the faucets. The local big box hardware store didn't have lines with those measurements in stock but it did have adaptors so all was well. Other than that the installation was very easy.
5,tight show,"shows back in the day weren't limited when it came to Topic matter. this show dealt with Race,Class&other subject matters.Ken Howard was cool. Kevin Hooks,&the whole Crew were on point.truth is there ain't really been another Basketball Movie or Tv show that has dealt with as many topics as this Show.this Show is timeless. not just about Basketball but life&Differences.team work at It's best."
1,"Terrible play yard, uncomfortable bassinet, poor construction","I was given this play yard as a gift while I was pregnant. The side leg joints would not snap into place and I had to return it to the store. I was given a replacement, this time when I assembled it at home the end leg joints would not snap into place. The bassinet seemed uncomfortable even for a very small/light newborn. It was not sturdy and the metal support bars could be felt through the thin mattress. It was very difficult to get the mobile to snap over the end of the play yard. It is also very heavy and would not be easy to travel with if that is your intention.Overall construction seems cheap. I would not recommmend this play yard."
2,Not Accurate,"I bought this for my 7 year old son for Christmas. Since he has been learning about money, I thought it would be fun for him. It has only been frustrating. It repeatedly counts dimes as pennies, causing us to reset the bank and try again. Just to find it continues to count the money inaccurately. Not a good learning tool, if it doesn't count the money accurately! My son loves playing with the bank, so I will return it and purchase a more trustworthy bank!"
2,It's OK,"I was thrilled to get this bank for use of the ""coffee fund"" at my work. But I was rather disappointed to find that there is NO way to adjust the amount of money listed in the jar if you remove the money. You have to reset it and drop all the remaining change back into the jug to re-total it. Not very convenient when you're regularly taking out money to purchase things."
3,a little tricky,"I had read quite favorable reviews on this product before I purchased it, so I was a little surprised to have trouble with it.The sensor that identifies the type of coin is very sensitive. If you hesitate at all when trying to insert a coin, it will register the wrong value. It is frustrating to reset and re-insert coins when this happens.Once you get the hang of inserting the coins, it seems to work OK, but this was a little tricky for my boys ages 8, 5, &4."
1,Please think twice about purchasing this game,"You can tell that Little League Baseball for GBA had some good intentions from the start. Unfortunately, almost every aspect of the game falls far short of any other baseball game out there. There are so many issues that I don't know where to begin. You can not control motion on pitches, which means the fancy pitch selector has no function except asthetics. If you hit a home run, you don't watch the ball flight....just an immediate splash screen saying ""Home Run."" The backgrounds and animations look nice atleast, with many different fields and stylish 3D batters. Unfortunately, the batter clicks and skips from missing frames. Some boys have girl names and visa versa. The worst thing about it is that some elementary baseball rules are ignored. Don't tag on a fly ball, no worries....just keep running.Overall, this game should not be purchased by anyone wanting to have fun playing a game."
5,Gorgeous!!!,"Here it is: ABC's ""The Lexicon Of Love."" It's my all-time favorite album. I remember buying this with my allowance in my early teens (during those ancient vinyl years) and falling in love with it. I played it so much, the grooves started to turn a bit white. I always had a weakness for disco, new wave and strings and this album had it all. Trevor Horn is a producer that's so unique and creative. The man inspires me. Then there is, of course, the very talented band. What can I say? They had some serious chops!This Deluxe Edition is wonderful! The only thing I regret about it is that it doesn't include the 12-inch mix of ""The Look Of Love.""Nonetheless, get this cd. It's a true blue classic!"
5,The Lexicon Of Love was a bright spot in the eighties,"This album came onto the scene in 1982.I was a junior in high school.After LoverBoy spread itself all over the air waves a band from Britian calling themselves ABC released The Look Of Love and Poison Arrow on MTV.It was a gtoup mixing Disco,Dance,Blues,Rock and a little Jazz while adding string textures.Most of the groups were into that mixing sounds and textures and some worked while others failed.Styx tried it with Mr Roboto and bombed! Never the less its kinda like a bad commercial,ya never forget it.Every song on this album is great to good and never lets up.Its definately a party album for us to remember the eighties rightly for that was a time period I could look back on and say. ""Yep gotta love the Eighties."""
3,Interesting Australian release of a live set.,"This is a live set, the full title being ""The Best Songs of China Crisis"" and it appears it may have been previously released as ""The Legacy of China Crisis"". It's not spectacular, but it's a nice set list. The musical quality has its peaks, but I'm sad we don't hear more audience interaction. It's a live album, which Amazon doesn't make clear, and I was honestly quite surprised that it was. Good Again is very elegant live, but overall it lacks the nearly wall of sound feel that China Crisis orchestrates in the studio."
4,Woody Allen's Radio Days,"A nostalgic, though funny and bizarre at times, look back on those golden days of radio with some great characters throughout the film. If you haven't seen it I recommend it."
2,christmas tree diaster,"I really really was pressing my luck on time frame to receive a christmas tree through an online order.When i received the item in time for christmas i was ecstatic! until i opened the box and the stand for the tree to erect with balance on was somehow gone. the shipper managed to leave out those pieces and i had to rush and get a tree that wasnt exactly what i wanted, to make matters worse- the stand didnt come with that one either. all i request is to send what is advertised IN WHOLEhappy holidays"
2,Missing leg stands,The tree was great but it was missing 2 of the 3 legs for the stand. There was no place to complain or try to get replacements.
1,review for black version of case,"A receptacle slash magnet for all kinds of dust, hair and debris. You will be shocked at the collection of dust particles on the inside of this case. I have no idea why it attracts so much dust. This problem could possibly be exclusive to the BLACK version of the case."
2,Poor Sound Engineering,"Bobby Byrd deserves much better than this recording. All you hear in this recording is his voice and the drums. The bass is lost - and that is a big, big, problem in funk. Note to recording engineer: If you do nothing at all else right, bring the bass up on funk! At times, the audience noise is louder than the chorus. The horns sound like they are locked in the bathroom. It sounds like they had two mikes; one for Bobby and one for the entire room.The songs on this CD are great and the performance was probably excellent, but we the listeners of this CD will never know. I would recommend other Bobby Byrd recordings."
4,Flood Light,"I just got the GameBoy Advance, and like everyone says, you need another light. I bought the Flood Light, and I am probably going to buy a worm light, they seem to be the highest rated. The Flood is great. No shadows. Good picture. No glare. I don't play more than about 10 minutes at a time, but so far the flood light seems the best. When I get the Worm Light, I'll review it also,"
1,Possible red flag,"I have not read the entire book. I'll just mention some things that put up a red flag for me and you can decide whether to buy. At the outset, the author has an imaginary conversation with God...where He is quoted as saying ""A high percentage of the prayers I answer are not even from adults. It's the kids, you know. They are the ones with the faith..."" and a few sentences later asserts that the greatest thing he ever did was to make kids: ""Back at creation one of the angels suggested I just make everybody adults straightaway. You know-skip the teenage thing. But the angel was wrong. Kids are great."" The author quickly goes on to quote Thomas Merton, who states that ""...God is everywhere and in everything and we cannot be without Him. It's Impossible."""
2,bored,"i ain't no philistine. subtlties were lost on me. check out ""down by law.""that movie is a straight up 100 percent masterpiece and succeeds in every aspect that i feel this film failed in."
4,IBM VisualAge for Java - tried it - loved it!,"I have tried several IDE's for Java ( J++, VisualAge, Java Workshop, Forte'). I found VisualAge to be very friendly - AND - the apps ran as expected. I have a few quibbles. I'm not too sure about the multiple window environments called browsers. There seems to be one for everything with only some differences between them. In addition, I'd like to see it generate an HTML trial page to test run the app as there are differences in runtime output/interaction in a JSP page and the applet viewer. The online documentation search engine sucks. I had lots better luck over at Sun's java site finding what I needed (thank you Sun). Overall, though, I rate VisualAge as my primary Java app builder IDE - no question on that."
4,good intro,"Here's the deal: if you're just starting to get into trance and you don't have any albums (or very few) this is a great one to get. You will be exposed to some great tracks (especially disc 2). If you are already a trance freak, you will probably find ATB's versions of the tracks too short and not mixed very well. Example: His version of universal nation is just over 4 mins. long, while the same record on Kimball Collins ""live in Toronto"" is just over 8 mins. If you don't know a lot about techno: This is important because the DJ can do a lot more with the song, and you the listener can usually get a lot more out of it if it's longer. ATB tries to cram a lot of songs on the CDs. Most techno CDs only have about 10 tracks, there are 16 or 17 on each disc of this set! In Conclusion, Great if you don't know a lot about Trance, still good, but not great, if you do."
1,i usually like woody allen flicks,but this one blows. it's really really bad. you end up hating annie hall (who is a totally annoying woman) and woody.avoid
3,Annie Hall,"This DVD arrived very quickly for standard mail and was in excellent condition. I would have appreciated some kind of bonus feature or two, but there was none. Then again, if the product is associated with Woody Allen, it seems very much his style. As for the movie itself, it's one of Allen's best, thanks to Diane Keaton. It's hard to believe the movie is now over 30 years old, but Keaton is as charming as ever. The 3 star rating is for the skimpy DVD. Keaton is a 5 star actor."
5,Love classic Woody Allen,"This is a smart, funny and well-shot Woody Allen film. Everyone else's reviews are college essays and reports, which means you have to watch it. Even if you rent it first, owning it is like having a piece of essential culture."
3,anne hall,"Woody Allen movies on dvd or blu-ray are not in 5.1 stereo.they look good on bluray dvds,so why are they not in surround sound ?"
5,Delightful,"This is a great adaptation of the cartoon Scooby. It brings the cartoon to life, and puts the control in your hands.The intro ""bridge"" video almost put me off, because it looked like they had used a cheesy 3-D modelling system to make the game. But once you get into the actual play mode, it's great. The character control is very smooth, and the animation is right on-target. I occasionally went through the same sequence several times just because it was fun to watch it happen on the screen.Age-wise, you can start about as young as you want - though the players under about 6 or 7 will need some help on some sequences that require both speed and timing (and reading) to get through. They put the ""horror"" warning on this entry, but it's all along the lines of the cartoon.I wouldn't put a maximum age on it. It's not a real difficult game, but there's plenty enough content to it for more experienced players: Fun adventure, neat gadgets, and humor. Almost anyone will have fun with it."
4,"Cute game,but some what difficult for young kids","We bought this game for my 6-year old son for Christmas. He plays alot and seems to enjoy it, but needs help getting through some of the levels. He always keeps trying, but I can tell he gets frustrated that he has to ask for help. Probably a great game for older kids and adults, but not so great for kids under 8."
5,The Ultimate Guidebook for Anti-Aging Cooking,"I bought this book because of its intriguing title and appealing cover. I'm sure glad I did. I'm beginning to execute Chef/Nutritionist Forberg's suggestions into my daily life. Not only are her recipes delicious, I feel more energetic---and its only been a few weeks.Who needs botox when berries, beans, greens, fish and other scrumptious natural foods will do the trick!"
3,EDU 618 Ashford University,I am usging this book as a textbook for my assessment class with Ashford University. To me this textbook is too complicated in understanding program evaluation and performance measurement. Ashford could have chosen a different text to complement the class.
5,Can be OC'd,"Very easy set-up. I've been using my computer for a month and seems to very stable. The bios has an Over-clocking feature, and it is easy to follow. I am not a computer wizard, so, I will just use it for normal use. I really can't complain about this MB. It really works and has given me no troubles."
1,WHO STARTED THIS TREND ANYWAY?,"Look, I took the usual two graduate semesters of Jackson and received a B,A respectively without hardly ever opening my Jackson text. I found it completely useless. There are so many other wonderfully explicit and dynamic texts to use other than Jackson. His text is boring and unfiling. He skips important (in my opinion crucial) steps in derivations. The problem sets are impossible and if you are one of the few to actually solve some, it is probably done via the assistance of previous graduate student's contributions... not your own. I DON'T KNOW WHO STARTED THIS TREND for making Jackson the mandatory Physics graduate text, but it is not serving its purpose. I suggest you look elsewhere for a supplemental text if you truly wish to *learn* electrodynamics and not just get through it. My suggestion.... Albert Shadowitz (Dover publications) ISBN:048665660-8. If I could, I would sell you my Jackson cheap, since I will never use it again... even to reference."
1,Jackson is without empathy and mercy.,I met Jackson once personally. Let's just say he's not the paragon of sanity one has in mind. He's very much of a sadist and this comes out very well in his book. I suggest he be put in a straight jacket so he never tortures students again with his writing.
4,Not as bad as others make it out to be. Definitely a classic,"Dense? Yes. That's what Electromagnetism is. Jackson does a wonderful advanced treatment of Electrodynamics, that unfortunatly fails in its treatment of specifics. Jackson makes an excellent reference guide, but keep your copies of Griffiths handy!"
3,It depends upon how you use it - NOT a good starting point.,"Having been through the torture imposed by all graduate programs in physics, I think we all agree that although Jackson's text is an excellent reference and a superb supplementary text, this is NOT what most people would call an appropriate starting point. Granted, some (and note bene SOME) problems are useful, a more graduated approach could be used without losing any of the flow of the text. Indeed, once I finished my two semesters (and took a LONG break), I found out many things in this text were a nice surprise upon review (it also helps if your original professor speaks English). Buy it. Keep it on the shelf as a badge of honor. You should, however, end up reading it and working through at least some of the problems."
4,decent,I bought it last saturday at their show at the pheonix theatre in petaluma. Its alright. Id buy it if i were you.
3,Lone Star State,"I found this guide to be quite thorough when it came to the major cities, granted it is not exactly a Rick Steves guide to Texas, but it did hit upon the most popular attractions and it got Dallas and Houston about right and I am very familiar with both cities, I really know very little about West Texas so I'll defer to the other reviewer on the guides shortcomings on accomedations and such out there, but if you are going to Austin, San Antonio, Houston, or Dallas-Ft. Worth, I think you will find this guide helpful, and easy to read."
1,Worse than useless,"I had always dreamed of a system for attaching buttons that had sprung off my trousers as my waistline swells. And this promised to be able to attach buttons. It's a great design - and better than zip tying the button back on (which is kind of what it does - pushing a ""H""-shaped piece of tagging nylon through the button and fabric).Or so I thought. In practice it broke on the first use - the flimsy tool bent one of its guides and another piece of plastic within it snapped. On the very first use. Totally useless. I would rather nail needles into my thumbs than buy one of these again. If someone gave me one as a gift, I would throw it straight in the trash. Probably in front of the gift giver's gaze.Utterly disappointing."
1,Buttoneer,"The device is too difficult to use easily. I have ruined about a dozen fasteners trying to fasten four buttons. like most people who buy this device, I'm relatively awkward with my hands. It's actually easier to sew buttons on by hand than to uss the buttoneer"
1,Doesn't Work,I wear lab coats at work and the buttons are always popping off. This sounded like a really great idea but it just doesn't work. I was unable to even get even one button attached so I'm not sure how durable the fix would be should you be lucky enough to get the button attached.
1,Too many problems,"A great idea, BUT: Not-trivial learning curve, difficult to use, and the plastic stays break frequently when you're trying to inset them. Not worth the trouble."
3,good for shirt; not pants,"I used it on a shirt and it worked ok. I also used it to re-attach a button on pants. It worked at first, but then the fastner popped off the pants. I think buttons that close around the waist might create too much stress."
3,Works as advertised,"Since I can't sew, I decided to try this for button repair. It's a little finicky, but once you get used to it, it gets the job done. I had one repaired button come off after one use, but I think that it was my fault. The second one that I applied to a pair of pants has had no difficulties."
2,don't try on pants!,"It does okay on shirts, but my husband tried to sew a button on his work pants and it doesn't hold!"
3,A suspensful book with a questionable ending,"I would loved this story, except that it doesn't give you and ending to the suspense, the story however is well written and descriptive"
3,fun movie,"I love this one! it's a classic! I saw it a looong time ago and just had to get it, to bad it doesn't come with more subtitles have some friends from abroad that liked it but did't get all of it, they're english wasn't that good lol, still I loved the movie!!!"
5,First saw this while living in Germany,"Many of the Germans in the audience loved it too! One of my favorite films. I even like the music style and, yes, I take guilty pleasure in the awful jokes incorporated in the film: ""I know a little German... and there he is!""The visual jokes are great too. Overall, just a lot of fun!"
3,Top Secret,Val Kilmer is really good at humiliating in the movie. And His way of being on top of a comedy of this movie. A great move to show your frends that havent laught in a wile. You nead to see it:)
4,"No 'Airplane!', but...","Good, fun spoof of WWII films, and cold war spy thrillers.Just - for me at least - not quite up to the lunatic genius level of`Airplane!' (which was created by the same team), with more dull patches,or jokes that don't quite work. But where it's funny, it's very funny. Certainlyworth a look if you've never seen it."
2,This is not Worms.,"I give Team 17 credit for trying but this is just garbage. Why would you take an award winning formula and destroy it? Worms World Party was, and still is the best worms game yet, and it had just about zero changes from it's big brother Worms: Armageddon. This is frustrating, childish, and unbelievably retarted. The upcoming worms title, Worms 3, will break the ice and create a whole new gaming world for us all. Wait for it to come out Summer of 2003."
2,I wished i had check the reviews before buying the Game,"When I first played Worms Armageddon on Nintendo 64 I was addicted. That game brought endless hours of Multiplayer Mayhem. So naturally when i heard that a game called Worms Blast was out for Gamecube I bought it immediately. . . WITHOUT CHECKING THE REVIEWS. Man what a waste of money. This is not worms people. Its a game called, ""bust a move"" with worms as the main characters. I would not recommend any gamers to actually buy this game especially true Worms gamers. My opinion is that its not even worth a rental. (but you can be the judge of that). Just go download Bust-a-move for free and save your money for a real game."
3,No todo lo que una podría saber,"Este libro parece más prometedor de lo que en realidad es. Lo compré pues estaba siendo anunciado en Cosmopolitan como un libro que ellos recomendaban. En realidad, el libro habla de todas esas cosas que ya sabemos y que sólo están siendo reiteradas hacia nosotras, o en el mejor de los casos nos ayudan a aceptar que son comunes a todos los hombres. Para lecturas que nos ayuden a entendernos mejor yo recomiendo el libro del Doctor John Gray ""los hombres son de marte y las mujeres de venus"" y ""you just don't understand"" de Debora Tannen."
3,life skills education - Now proven,The book gives a no-nonsense advice to improve life skills essential for health and success.The text interspersed with funny cartoons offers the reader easy reading.Practical strategies with helpful hints for implementation is a added bonus.I would recommend the book to anyone seriously interested in their health and success in life.
4,Good starter book,This is a great starter book. Really helpful to someone totally new to the subject. The pages are glossy and good quality.
4,Great for Beginners,"My son developed an interest in whittling after seeing someone at a craft show, and he wanted to try it himself. I bought him this book over a year ago, and he still pulls it out and works on the techniques. The instructions are easy to follow, and they give some good ideas for projects. It is written in such a way that he can either follow step by step, or he can just read through and then apply the techniques to his own projects. He has enjoyed doing both. The book itself is small, so it is easy for him to carry around. He has really enjoyed using the skills he has learned from this book."
3,Didn't blow my mind,"Although I can't say the book is bad, it was not what I was expecting.I was expecting a manual that would allow me to pick up my pocket knife and start working on my first piece :-)Having said that, the book does give a nice general overview of the subject of whittling."
5,Great way to spend some time decompressing...,"I love to camp and a friend gave me this book along with a Swiss Army Knife...I never saw myself as a ""whittler"" and now I'm hooked. The projects are fun, easy, and don't require a whole lot more than some twigs and some sitting still. And a bonus -- it includes useful camping tips and delicious recipes for outdoor staples such as peanut butter smores, gorp, and lemonade."
2,Disillusioned,"Perhaps I expected too much from this book. I personally skimmed over it before I ordered it from Amazon.com and thought it would fit the bill explaining the registry and how it works.It did just that but on an advanced level. If you are like me, not advanced in XP or the registry, then you will be disappointed with this book. I did get much out of it but only after researching many topics like: scripts, INF files, and more. It&#65533;s unfortunate for me that much of Windows XP Registry Guide will wither in the wind and I will have to purchase a similar book more on my level of expertise.My review is not to condemn this book but only point out it&#65533;s for the more advanced computer addict.I hope this review will help someone."
5,A Wonderful Book!,"This book may become my all time favorite for modeling language and rhythm among all the many versions of There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly. But it is even more wonderful for children of all ages. Music majors will love it, and I plan to buy it for my son's orchestra teacher. The art of John O'Brien is so complementary of the words, they tell beyond the story line. The author and the artist have worked hard to show accuracies about musical instruments in relation to current as well as historical times. A classroom teacher using this book can easily expand discussions and help children relate text to world examples and model best practice for students. I teach pre-service teachers at the university level in Children's Literature and Garriel's book is a must for such courses. I can't rave enough!"
5,Gulp!,"This book is delicious! A parody on the song, "" I know an old Lady who Swallowed a Fly"", ""I know a Shy Fellow Who Swallowed a Cello"" is funnier and delightfully illustrated. I purchased it because I am a music educator, and I highly recommend it for children from ages 3 to 100, but only if they have active imaginations."
5,Blooming Onions,"We used this on Christmas Day and loved it. Though next time I think we will try soaking the onion to make it easier to cut. Some of the reviews said it was not worth the money, and it does take some umph to cut the onion, but it is a hand cutter, not a machine really. But for us it is great, and for my son that misses the blooming onions at the fair, this was a perfect gift."
1,Patrick Michaels is himself a distorter of science,"In 1988 James Hansen testified in front of the US Congress about global warming.He included in his testimony a graph with three possible scenarios on it - three lines on a graph.The top and bottom lines were said by Hansen to be the least likely scenarios. The middle line was the most plausible scenario, according to Hansen.Ten years later, Patrick Michaels testified to the US Congress. In this testimony, he produced Hansen's graph, but with the bottom two scenarios totally deleted, thus leaving only the most extreme top scenario. Patrick Michaels then argued that his doctored graph, with the ""most plausible scenario"" deleted by Michaels, showed that ""the forecast made in 1988 was an astounding failure"".Patrick Michaels has a cheek trying to lecture anyone on the distortion of science, after his deliberate distortion of Hansen's views."
1,Independent Thinkers Beware!,"Mr. Michaels is a member of no less that 20 institutes, think tanks, and other national groups that receive significant funding from Exxon--places like the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation, the George C. Marshall Institute, and the Heartland Institute. He also admits that he has accepted funding from various fossil fuel industry groups. One would have to suspend a lot of disbelief to think that such a well-funded person is not serving as a spokesperson for these industries, or, at least, is badly, badly compromised."
3,Boring summation of two fascinating women and queens,"I love both of these women and their place in history, but Plowden's work leaves me cold. This could have been a fascinating, gripping, dynamic fiction tale of love, ambition, politics, history and royalty such as Susan Kay's ""Legacy"". Despite the alluring title, it's not. Not worth buying."
5,A stroller that's always with you,"We were unsure whether this is a good item because of other critical reviews here - however, we found it most convenient for our uses. It steers very easily - perfect on mall floors, and very well on the street. The only drawback are hard plastic wheels, but we have used it for 3 months by now, and it hasn't been a major problem.We put it in the trunk of our car, so wherever we go, we always have a stroller with us."
2,handles like a bull dozer,"bought this to use with my Graco 35 car seat, after many reccomendations from friends. car seat snaps in easy enough, but the stroller frame is a pain in the neck to open and to close - super awkward twist handle and lock thingy. it really doesn't fold up all that small - there are plenty of strollers that are way more compact. i could deal with all of this, but the handling is the killer - it's such a tank. bad engineering,"
3,Gets the job done but not great,"There are several pros and cons to this stroller systemPros:-Not as bulky as a travel system. You don't look like you're pushing a yacht around the park.-Folds up nice and flat. Have no problem fitting it in the trunk.-Absolutely HUGE basket. You could really go nuts at the mall and not fill this thing up.Cons:-There are no shocks on the wheels. When my sleeping baby goes over rough terrain, she often startles and then wakes up.-As my husband says, it handles like a truck. You have to think ahead when steering because this thing turns on a frisbee, not a dime.-Cup holders are useless. About the only thing that would fit in it is a small coffee and the warning label says not to put anything hot in it.All in all, if I had to do it again, I'd buy a lightweight travel system and look like a small yacht strolling around the park because then at least when my baby outgrew this model, I'd have a functional stroller that handles well."
5,A lifesaver!,"I don't know what I would do without this stroller. I have a very compact car and this fits perfectly into the trunk. Sometimes it's hard to open because of the wheels get stuck, but that is the worst of it. The basket is perfect for holding everything you could possibly need. I will be so sad when my DS gets to big for his car seat and I have to get ride of the stroller frame."
5,"perfect for shopping, doctor visits, carrying in car!","We have a BOB stroller that we love, but it was hard for me to get the BOB in and out of the car. This stroller is perfect for visiting the doctor, going to the store, or short walks. Huge basket on bottom, easy to fold and very light weight. One of the cheaper infant strollers, but exactly what you need!"
3,Works but a design flaw,"This works great for our snugride car seat. The problem is in trying to open it or fold it back down. It does not do so easily. The manufacturer states that you can do it with one hand if needed, but it has usually taken two people to get it open. It's supposed to be simple: pull the button back, twist the handle, pull. It isn't. But once you get it open, it works pretty well. The wheels are a bit of trouble on grassy areas, otherwise, we're pretty satisfied with it."
3,Warning...do not put coffee in cup holder,"I bought the Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame with the Graco safeseat. They work great together. Just a couple problems. 1. If you put coffee in the cup holder and go over a bump it could spill on your child. 2. If you have a diaper bag you want to put on the bottom of the stroller, put it in before you put attach the car seat. Otherwise then that, it is fast to open and to travel with."
5,Great product!!!,This is the best product for parents with little ones in infant car seats. I had the old version of this with my first son and we lost it in several moves and this one is MUCH better than the old one. The seat is so easy to put in. The basket is large and I love that the handle can be adjusted for height. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an easy alternative to the big bulky strollers. We have a Chicco Key fit and it works wonderfully.
4,great for the money,"We were given a very nice Graco car seat and base for our new baby, so we didn't want to register for an entire new travel system, but we liked the idea of the convenience for those occasions when we do need a stroller.The stroller frame was very easy to assemble. I'm petite, and getting it in and out of the car is very easy for me, though it does take two hands to fold and unfold. The car seat attaches securely and it feels sturdy. My only major complaint is that the ride is very rough on asphalt, so it isn't good for walking with my baby in the neighborhood for exercise.This product meets our needs and was a good buy."
5,I love this stroller frame!,"This product is great! I have a regular full size stroller, but I prefer using this one when running errands and such. It is easy to fold up and put into the back of our small truck. It has been a godsend!"
3,Good for the price,"This is great for short trips and shopping! My snugride fits into the frame easily and i can do everything with one hand! The basket is big and accessible and it is amazingly easy to put together. I have had to take my baby on my own to the Uk and back, through 2 airports and i have to say, this was brilliant. It is very light and so easy to put up and down, especially useful at security where nobody helps you! It serves its purpose well..however, it is NOT good for walks etc. Whilst in the Uk i was told it would not have passed safety tests there, and it is quite flimsy and wobbly..but it is not meant to be an every day stroller so i feel that for the price and for shopping or airport trips, it is excellent..and very cheap!"
4,Love my snap-n-go!,"I love this as a snap-n-go for my Graco35. We were going back and forth between buying this and buying the adaptor bar for our City Mini but opted for this since it's lighter and more convenient. I actually don't love the car seat itself (Graco35) but this in combination as a stroller was perfect for the first 6 months. It's lightweight, has ample storage and cupholders, steers well. Not a lot bad to say about it, except that sometimes when it's folded the ""one-touch"" open button doesn't work because the wheels kind of lock together. Then you have jiggle the wheels a bit then the button works. It was easy to snap the car seat in to place. All in all, this is a product I'm glad I bought and would use again if we used the same car seat for the next kid."
3,Wish the stroller was a little more shock absorbent,"We live in the city and I thought this would be easier than purchasing a separate stroller, but the wheels on this stroller are plastic and not very shock absorbent. We had to go very slow so that the baby didn't jostle around so much as he's only 10 days old. Wish we would have researched if there was something more shock absorbent for infants.I wanted to update my review, my baby is now 6 weeks old. Be careful of the brakes while walking. The brakes are not up very high and while crossing the street, my foot hit the brake and the stroller stopped in the middle of the street. I had the right of way, just wanted to update with the sensitivity of the brakes."
1,DON'T BUY!!!,"I am very disappointed about this item.1)It is VERY VERY difficult to unfold even with TWO HANDS!2)It is not easy to drive on sturdy places. Front wheels are turning around and heading different directions.3)Once the carseat is snapped in place, it is VERY difficult to get any items in and out of the basket due to the fact that the carseat rests very low on the frame.4)It is not universal. It can only be used with Graco Car seats. So, the car seat selection is very tight. Graco Car seats are the cheapest and low quality car seats in the market.I could not refund this item but if I had a chance, I would. DO NOT BUY!"
5,Great!,I was very pleased when I heard the quality of the voices on this CD. I was looking for the words to the songs my mother sang to me as a child (ie. rocking me to sleep). I wanted to learn them so I could now sing them to my little girl. This is easy to sing with and learn all of the words.
3,Good movie,"Frank the Pug is featured too prominently and there are too many then-contemporary references to pop culture, which takes away from the humor. I wish they would have kept the uniforms from the end of the second movie for continuity's sake. But it's still a funny, enjoyable movie."
4,What to expect from a sequal,"I know that most sequals really stink. And, compared to other sequals, MIB II is pretty decent. It forces us to remember what exactly we want in a sequal. If we really wanted a fresh formula and a new concept, we'd be in the theater next door watching something else. Instead, we come to see the things we loved in the original. Just watching the interaction between Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones is worth the ticket price. Basically, they took the original screenplay and mixed it up a bit, added some new characters, refurbished some old ones, and *voila*! and new movie! This isn't necessarially a bad thing; we got what we were looking for, just it isn't something new and original. See it if you liked the original, just for the different material of the things you really loved."
2,Why even add the II?,"Men in Black II (Barry Sonnenfeld, 2002)The tagline on the posters for MIB2 was ""Same planet. New scum."" It should have been ""Same movie. New cameo."" Sonnenfeld and writer Robert Gordon managed to make almost the exact same movie twice. Same jokes, same basic plot, save overuse of special effects. It was funny the first time. **"
5,excellent,I am a fan of the MIB series. I couldn't pass up the newest edition of the MIB series. Great fun.
3,Its not as good as it looks in SOME ways !!!!!,I think the main reason that seperates this from the first is the sci-fi part it is not as realistic as the first and is a big downfall to me i think that the first was much better and in was actually really disapointed in it throughout the whole movie i kept waiting for it to get better but it didnt. Of course will smith is funny throuought the movie. In all this was a great thought up sequal but not my type of genre.(Also there is nothing about basketball in it)Just kidding!!!!!
4,exactly what i ordered,"Besides packaging issues, i loved this item. It will be a Christmas gift so im just glad it wasn't damaged."
4,Men in Black Strike Again,"Those mysterious men in black return to save the world once again, this time from a slimy, slithery blob played by sexy Lara Flynn Boyle. The comic timing was brilliant, and the effects impressive, despite a pretty dumb storyline and some repetition from the first movie. Overall, mindless but fun summer entertainment."
2,Black suits coming. Duck your heads for cover!,"They're back in black...and that's really all there is to this film. It's a basic story that reunites Agent K with J to kill more aliens.The film is not completely without merit. There are some good jokes and humorous scenes involved. There is also a better array of special effects. But at the same time, the goofiness and in-your-face style of the film takes on a more unbelievable edge.The characters are still well-developed and well enacted. But the story is rather dull and offers little to the imagination (except for the ending locker sequence, but even that scene is bizzare and unbelievable).I consider the first Men In Black to be much better. I found the sequel to be dull."
3,Not as good as the first,"A good movie, but not nearly as good as the first. Like that they brought Kay back as he's the better lead."
2,Just feels off!!!,"This from the very beggining feels off. Something is missing from this one that was in the first. And it's not lack of being original, because the story works, and it's not flawed preformances because everyone brings it to the table. Just the heart of the movie is gone. It feels witout a skelliton.Each trick seems to be like that guy at the party thats always funny but just having an off night. I'ts fun in places, but when it's not, you feel it ten fold. Rent, don't buy."
2,"Buena miniserie, pero...",La grabación tiene algjunas manchas blancas.No tiene traducción al castellano.No tiene extras.
1,Masada DVD,Very disappoint DVD version of Masada. Just no extra feature and no subtitle and no closed-caption. Just plain movie with scene selection in menu and nothing else. good thing I rented from Netflix.
1,NOT COMPLETE,This is NOT the entire mini-series. It does not tell the whole story. It is clear there are episodes missing.
2,Too small!,"This carrier is cute, but Baby Stella BARELY fits in the straps, and won't fit if she has her winter clothes on. The bag itself is small and wouldn't fit the stuff we hoped to pack for her, like the changing set and feeding set. Overall I would not recommend this product - get a bigger backpack at any store, and let Baby Stella ride in the front pocket or peek out the top!"
3,"Cute but very, very small","Bought this for my daughter using a gift card she got over Xmas. She already had the doll and a couple of outfitsAnd I though this would be a nice way of carrying her doll and her stuff around. Well it is good way to carry the doll, but not her stuff. One can barely fit in the dolls feeding stuff (her bottle, can, cereal bowl and bib), as this carrier is so small. It is even hard for her to put on, my daughter is skinny but has long arms and is even difficult for her to put it on even with assistance (short straps).Not happy with the purchase as it does not fit the purpose. I wanted my daughter to be able to carry the doll and her things and still have her arms free. Not so, still has to carry the outfits separately in another bag.If you want to purchase this item, be aware it is very small and would not be able to fit much inside it."
1,A talentless Britney of her day?,I was pretty disappointed by this album. I'm a big fan of The Free Design and of pop psychedelia/sunshine music and so ordered this album somewhat blindly out of Amazon recommendation: but I though this album was really not in that league at all. Guryan has a very weak sing-song little-girl voice and the material is mere pre-rock pop more like Leslie Gore on valium. The arrangements are also unstriking and soporific. I'd have to say stay away.
2,"Critters, now they're invading YOUR space","After three Critter movies, we get to the final Critters movie entitled 'Critters 4: They're Invading Your Space'. I was wondering when they would have a Critters movie that takes place in space since they are originally from space and having the first three being taken place on Earth and around the same town. While the humor that you'd expect from the Critters isn't there like in the other films and if you are a fan of the series like I am, this is probably one of the first things that you'll notice about this movie. The writing seems to have improved over the previous three, but I'm not sure about the characters in the movie other than Charlie, who's the only character that has been in all four movies. The acting is a better than the third movie, but not by much at least to me. Overall Critters 4, gets 2.5 stars out of 5."
3,"Good sequel, bad ending!","I thought this was a good sequel but it raised a big question. Why did Charlie's friend Ug become bad? I didn't get that part and didn't like the idea because he was good in the first 2 films. The first film is my favorite, the second was very good and the third was ok but could have been better. I have all of these movies on dvd and if anybody's a fan of the Critters films like I am, these movies are a good part of your dvd collection."
2,Awful!,Awful sequel (...) in where the Critters are transported to the future (looking at the montage from Critters 3) and make it on to a spaceship viciously attacking the crew once again. A final showdown ensues between the critters and the humans. But is it that final???Rubbish sequel
4,First of a Good Mystery Series,"This is the first book of a well done mystery series set in the late Middle Ages in England. Dame Frevisse, the sleuth and center of these tales, is an older nun in a small community. Author Frazer includes a lot of rich detail from the time period and creates some very interesting and life-like characters. This first story is one of the better ones in the series, but I have not found a bad one yet. If you like medieval mysteries, this is a series not to be missed. However, if the genre is not your favorite, I'd recommend starting with another series like the Fidelma series by Peter Tremayne."
2,Male sex fantasy 'comedy' with no redeeming features,"This movie became boring with its one-line series of jokes about men trying to cheat behind their wives backs and get away with it. While they mildly change their ways on the surface at the end, they really ha vent changed within.I didn't find the 'humour' funny. From a female view the guys are cute but jerks with a one-dimensional attitude to women.I found myself fast-forwarding through it hoping it may change but it never seemed to.Any marks I give it are for cinematography, nice scenery and the actors who are solid enough themselves.The buffed shirt-off displays of Salman Khan do nothing for me - though they appeared to please him a lot!Guys seem to like this more than females as it is men behaving badly and largely achieving their fantasies even though it takes a bit of work and some 'comedic' misunderstandings and cover-ups. Definitely not my style of humour.The music and small amount of dancing didn't rescue it from mediocrity either."
2,Fake widescreen buyer beware!,"This dvd release is not presented in the true aspect ratio the movie was originally filmed and shown in theaters in.All 4 sides of the frame are cut mostly the top and botton half of the picture to fit what looks like a full screen version to fit 16x9 widescreen tv.Dont the studio's get it? The reason people who want widescreen versions of film is so that they can see the full veiw of the picture frame the way the director intended.Thoes of us who want widescreen dont want any of the picture frame to be cut out out!Great movie, good picture qualtity apart from the cut apect ratio."
1,Should Have Been Clearly Declared,"It should be clearly declared when items such as this DVD are in a format which WILL NOT work on devices sold in the U.S.. This DVD is of NO value to me. It was a waste of my money. What's most aggrevating is the declaration of a ""no return"" policy AFTER THE FACT! Sales such as these should NOT be allowed on Amazon. Amazon should INSIST on FULL, UP-FRONT disclosure of such things so U.S. citizens are not taken like I was!"
5,Jack Without Walt,"Jack Lemmon! Man oh man, I am a huge, huge, huge, Jack Lemmon+Walter Matthau fan. They go together like two peas in a pod. However, in this movie, Jack is paired with Sandy Dennis, who is a great actress as well, in a Neil Simon comedy. I remember the first time I saw this movie, I thought...okay, where's Walter? But as the movie played on, it became very obvious to me that Jack could hold his own, and hold it well without Walter. This is one for the collection. Lemmon is, of course, brilliant! But I'm still a huge fan of Lemmon and Matthau."
4,Good family film,"This is a good family film that contains some humor and the importance of family. It also shows that money (the main character is offered a six-figure salary) is not the most important thing. The only downside was a slip of the Lord's name in vain. Other than that, I would recommend this movie for the entire family and appreciate the lack of violence, swearing, and sexuality that so many movies today have. I have added What I Did for Love to my Mom-Approved Family Movie list on my wordpress blog."
4,Very good story,"I recommend ""What I Did For Love"" in that it had good story content, funny unexpected turn-of-events, and a happy ending. This is a story that does not grow old with the watching!"
1,WHAT A SHAM!!,"Though this is a good FICTION book, I am amazed that Lynn Andrews thinks we are dumb enough to believe this is an autobiography. Give me a break!! After doing some research on the internet, I am also amazed to find out that her live-in companion at the time this was written was David Carson (co-author with Jamie Sands in Medicine Cards book) who, at the time, claimed HE helped her write it. Also note that in the Medicine Cards book, David dedicates the book to three aunts, and two happen to have the names Ruby and Agnes---the same two female characters in Medicine Woman...hmmmmm. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. There are plenty of other SINCERE and HONEST books about Native American Shaminism and spirituality without wasting your time on this one."
5,A big Surprise!,"Michelle wants to be a ballet star like Dj and Stephine but her family thinks shes really good and shes not very good. So she comes up with a plan,but will it work? Read this great book and you will find out!"
4,Primera Fila,"There was a small crack in the bottom right corner when I received it in the mail, but the CD itself is in excellent condition, and I am very happy with my purchase."
1,Cheaply made garbage. Buy a better product.,I own many items from Pampered Chef but this one was a waste of time and money. I would have banished it to the household of a family member but due to my disappointment I decided to donate it instead.My wife started taking an interest in cupcakery but this is not worth it.
3,"Panther, a little dated",I found the panther book well researched but a little basic. Some areas including the more obscure late war options need more detail and the book itself would benefit from the latest research. The book is a good read and as such represents good value but leaves you wanting more. Perhaps the Trojca books or similar would be a better option.
4,"""I love you Nancy""","Hartigan's last hour on the job sends him to stop the rapist son of senator Roarke from claiming his next victim, the young Nacny Calahan. Hartigan is framed for her kidnapping and trapped and beaten in a prison cell for the next so many years, etc. When he lies and tells officers he is the one responisble for the various rapes and murders he is released. He ends up accidentally leading the real rapist right back to his original target. The good guy always wins though..."
1,A basic computer primer light on the garden.,"A third of this book is devoted to basic computer concepts that can be learned elsewhere(and better). The garden part is a collection of freeware, shareware, and sample programs many DOS based. Not worth the money"
2,Unrelentingly morose,"Evidently a TV movie, but it's a little better than most of those. The tale is dark and ambiguous. The acting is just ok. I didn't read the novel, but the author's other one, ""The Things They Carried,"" is well regarded. You could do worse."
2,So much potential...,"The illustrations and concept of this book are wonderful. The writing, however, is disappointing. The title, ""Canoe Days"", is plural, but the story seems to be about a singular day trip in the canoe. Also, Gary Paulsen uses sentence fragments (ex: ""Watching for frogs to make a dinner."") and awkward punctuation, which prevents this from being an excellent book. He ends his description with a review of what he sees, and includes a reference to ""the badger"". There is no badger in either the prior text or the illustration, so why is it mentioned there?I was sad to see such poor quality from a distinguished author."
4,great tea,"This tea is very good. I don't know if the weight loss thing is true, but this tea is well worth buying, just for the taste."
5,The search is over,"The long search for a quality oolong tea, that tastes great and doesn't tax your wallet. Flavorful, robust and delicious, this is a soothing vacation without travelling. Look no further, the search has ended. Great product, great service. Wuyi Oolong tea, the best."
5,I Don't Want To Talk About It,"The book arrived in excellent condition and the delivery time was okay. It was to be used as a text book, and was. The student who used it stated that the book was an excellent study of the subject.I hope to read it soon, myself."
4,Eye Opening about male depression,"I read this book when my son's therapist gave it to him. Since then I gave the book to a neighbor and a nephew, all suffering from depression. The book makes you realize that our western culture has steered men into a macho role, which for many of them turns out to be self destructive in the end. Reading the book helps guys realize where their depression came from and how to deal with it in a positive way. It helps them accept it and not feel guilty about their feelings.I think everyone should read this book and become sensitized to the epidemic of male depression."
3,Genistein Soy,This product has a very good unit price per dose. Taking one tablet in the morning and one in the evening helps to keep the soy in your system. The only negative is that each of the tablets are larger than any other soy tablet that I have seen and you have to take two of these large tablets to equal one smaller tables of the other brands.
3,hard to swallow,"My endocrinologist suggested this to me for hot flashes. I didn't notice improvement, but It could be because I couldn't take 2 a day. I had a problem swallowing them. They are coated, but large, and I tend to have dry mouth/throat issues. The quality of the products from this company is excellent so maybe it will work better for you."
4,Solid,"Tompkins's(ed.) _Reader-Response Criticism_ is an excellent place to start for any student of reader theory. It is a collection of essays that deals with the development of literary response theory, from New Criticism to post-structuralism."
2,It's not built to last,"My YP-K3 is 2 years old, and it's unusable now. The display started getting dimmer about 6 months ago, now I can't see it at all. You can't operate the thing unless you can see the display, so it's useless. I checked on getting it repaired (it's out of warranty), and the estimated cost is $85.00. I liked it when it worked, but when you pay $100 for something, you expect it to last more than 2 years.My wife has a Sansa Clip. Same features, more compact, and less than half the cost."
4,A forgotten read,I read this book about three years ago. It's a guide to good health from which you can glean helpful tips on living a healthy lifestyle. I used it when I was learning more about health and wellness. It's a good read.
3,It's alright,Mostly quotes referencing God. Which I dont have a problem with its just not what I was looking for. I wanted more of a look into yourself and find inspiration type quotes.
5,Shane Shane Shane,I still remember this movie years later.The scenes are fantastic. Its got great atmosphere and the name Shane haunts me to this day. Its really worth watching. WOW.
1,Alan Ladd's Costume Was Terrible!,"I saw ""Shane"" when it was re-released in the mid-sixties. No matter how beautiful the backdrop of the mountains or the performances of the actors, the film had one fatal flaw. Alan Ladd's ""Davey Crockett"" costume. It was terrible! A gunfighter wearing fringed buckskins? The costume designer should have been shot down by Jack Palance. Ladd should have been dressed in a black suit, dark brown shirt and a black, low crowned hat with the brim turned down. Forget the film, and read the book."
1,CD was a good buy,My daughter is doing this novel in school and so I bought it to help her.I am in Jamaica.The acting was great but the story did not follow the book at all in terms of chapter sequence and timelines.Did not expect a perfect match but this was to way off.It was good for her though as it brought the story alive and will hopefully incite her interest in the book.I do not regret buying it.
4,A pretty good Western,"I have never been much for Westerns, and this movie is no exception. I used it as research for a class. The story was pretty interesting, and the hero was, of course, admirable."
5,dead man riding,"'shane' is my favorite western. it's just about perfect and ,i think, everything that could be said about this film has been said. i would only like to add why ,imho, shane didn't respond to joey's cries of ""come back, shane!"" i believe that shane didn't want to die in front of joey.shane was gut shot by palance, and if you watch closely as shane rides off, just before the film ends, you can see shane's hand stiffen up. he's dead.that's my observation, although some others believe that shane couldn't return because he had fallen in love with jean arthur.unlike another western classic 'red river,' this movie had a great ending.believe what you will, but i really think shane died in the saddle."
5,Shane,"Exciting, heart-warming and stunningly directed by veteran George Stevens, ""Shane"" also features a smart, lean script and inspired performances throughout. It ranks as one of our top westerns and top films. Dont miss that incredible ending"
5,good manual,"I never had interest in chemistry (and probably never will) but I found this book easier than most. By easier I do not mean that there is not much content, but the way of writing and the explainations are given in simple terms, making it better than most books. Many concepts which were greek to me were easily understood, and the excersises were designed to make a person think and apply knowledge. It is a good book, but then again, unless you're interested in chemistry this book won't magically pour knowledge of chemistry into your head. All this does is make you learn chem the way it should be learned, by understanding and applying knowledge. Among most of the chem books i've come across I'd rate this as one of the best. This manual is useful for lab exercises, if you're a student. After using this book a lot of lab excersises were very very easy to me, and I understood concepts more than by listening to the professor."
1,"Poor Quality, No Warranty",This cable stopped working in less than a year. I contacted eforcity about a replacement but they offer no warranty.
2,Makes them sound human,"Wow... this cd makes In Flames sound average at best. Very poorly produced and the vocals are terrible. The guitars, when in harmony, sound off key and the timing is off. There is some improvization present, which makes this a fairly interesting listen. At one point, they break down into ""Raining Blood"", which while cool, has been done by just about every band out there. Hell, Strung Out pulled it off better. That shouldn't be. There are gaps in vocals where it seems that Anders took a break and had a smoke, or it trying to coax the crowd into singing along. Either way, nothing shows up. They should really try to do another live album, and really nail the production. I have heard other live albums from other metal bands (Metallica, Megadeth, Pantera) and those blow this away. Its not even close. Still, if you are into In Flames, it is fun to listen to. It is a good cd to learn their music to if you play guitar because everything is fairly easy to pick out. Rock on."
4,Great wax and QD for the price,"Two great products for one great price. Put the DP MaxWax on top of the Klasse twins and it was worth it for sure. Easy on easy off little elbow grease required here. The QD also works great, been using once a week for three weeks and my car still looks like I just waxed it. I also wash every week with a cheap eagle one washn and the wax holds up great to it. Got some Wolfgang Fuzion coming in the mail, im curious how the MaxWax will compare. Stil for the money ive yet to see better than MaxWax."
2,"Double duty,,,,in theory","I couldn't wait to purchase a Toastation toaster since it had the toaster and a toaster oven. However, it was awkward to use and seemed cheaply made. When using the toaster, there was no way to stop the toasting early if desired. If they were to make the necessary design changes, I would purchase another one because I still think the concept is a good one."
1,Neither a good toaster nor a good oven,"This multi-function device does none of it's tasks well. Toasting is extremely uneven and when used as an oven, it just burns the top of anything thicker than a piece of toast."
5,Won't be disappointed!,This is one of my favorite Margaret Rutherford movies. This actress is entertaining and funny. I have the box set of four of Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple and I treasure them all.
5,Ana Moura - Aconteceu,"Ana is a very passionate artist. I had the opportunity to see her in concert in Ihla Terceira in the Azors and she was worth every single minute of it.Nice voice, nice presentation, very down to earth girl."
5,I Love Schleich toys,"I love Schleich toys, I started getting these toys for my daughter when she was born, she now has hundreds. the are tough, well painted and beautiful. She makes great worlds and they are fun for the entire family. these are the kind of toys that will last generations. The entire family knows more animal names and where they live, they spark conversation about wild life conservation. As with all well made things they are expensive."
5,Bright Future !!!,"From small underground phenomenon until now getting signed onto Columbia Records, MESH has proven everybody that they're here to stay and ready to merge into mainstream arena. Columbia certainly knows the potential of this group..... and oh boy, was they correct ! In my opinion, this is THE BEST ALBUM that the group has ever come up with. It's a perfect blend of electronic/synthpop with moody feelings..... full of heartfelt lyrics....... and layered sounds-- synthesizers, keyboard, percussion, drum, etc. All songs are absolutely great. This is not your usual synthpop, but more like 'moody/dark/sentimental'-kind of electronic/industrial, BUT not goth either. If you like Depeche Mode's ""Ultra"" album, you may like this one too !! Just pick it up. Peace !!"
5,I saw this live...,"She was the most beautiful, most exciting singer I ever saw. Live this sounded even more beautiful and here Callas, who scared me to death as Medea, looked so fragile and touching... I also saw Sutherland and Scotto afterwards... I'll never forget the Visconti-production with Callas. Listen to her and Valletti and admire Bernstein. In my day this was what we called heaven... Enjoy!"
4,Good movie,Such a good old movie. Tried looking for it everywhere in stores and online and this was where I found it. The disk was brand new and it was just an amazing movie
3,you may need a malay speaker to guide you along,"The book is not bad at all. However, its too formal. You may need a malay speaker to guide you along with pronunciatian and sentence formation. I speak the language and bought this for my hubby. He finds it difficult to remember, perhaps just the way the book is set up."
3,"OK, not great","Got these on a special sale deal. I think they're worth the discount price, but not full price."
1,very poor quality,i am bitterly disappointed with these towels. i was expecting high quality cotton fluffy ones and instead got very average quality. they are virtually indistinguishable from the ones i buy from k-mart for 1/3 of the price.
5,Tastes great and works very very well,"I would highly recommend this product for occasional constipation. It tastes great, it is easy to take and works very well when used as recommended. I was surprised how effective and gentle it is."
3,My View On Books,I think that this book was a little less amusing than Ms. Martin's other books. I LOVE her series and one bad book doesn't spoil it!
5,I'm looking for the radio version,"I have the song on the album, but I want the radio version. The one without Mr. White on it."
5,Steps!!! You've done it again! YOU RULE!!!,Not only does this single offer the ultimately groovy Heartbeat and the music-thumping TRADEGY! you get an instrumental version to sing and bop along with! STEPS - from your number one fan thankyou + welldone!!!! xx
3,"Mostly About New York City, Politics and People Than Rats","This book is well-written in an engaging style. The prose is clear and easy to read. Unfortunately, it is not what I was expecting. There are too many political, historical and biographical snippets - many of which are not obviously rat-related - than I was expecting. The amount of information on rats in history, their evolution, biology, behavior, contribution to plagues, etc., would occupy perhaps about 30 pages, or so. I would therefore agree with prior reviews who have made similar comments on this otherwise interesting book."
2,Needs a different title,"This book does contain some interesting facts and anecdotes about rats. But the subject is less ""Rats"" than it is ""How I spent a year writing a book about rats."" You can judge for yourself if that sounds like an interesting subject for a book. For my part, if I'd done my shopping more carefully I'd have skipped this one."
2,Not very good,"As other reviewers have noted, this book is compromised by two serious flaws. One, rats turn out to be an insuffiently engaging subject for a micro-history of this sort. I don't feel like I learned much about them that was particularly interesting or unexpected, and the book feels padded. Two, Sullivan is a lousy writer. His prose is rambling and disorganized. He makes spelling errors, misuses words, uses tenses in disagreement, and more. Was this book even edited, I wondered? I doesn't seem like it. The yarns he spins to pad the book are not very interesting and tend to petter out without going anywhere. He wrote a book about himself writing a book about rats, and it's not a good one."
2,Meandering book; many errors in Kindle edition,"This is the first book to make me reconsider the Amazon Kindle. It is clear the book was scanned, and then never checked for errors. I have counted no less than 50 typographical errors. (Nice Quality Control, AMAZON!) It reminds me of the free classics on Google Books.Next, the book itself is not well-written. The author jumps suddenly from 9/11 to plague to odd figures in New York's rat-fighting history.This book reads like a series of loosely related articles by a person with ADHD. Or, like a series of rat factoids from CNN Headline News or USA Today.It is not a ""book."""
3,Couldn't finish it,"I hoped this book would enthral me like ""Cod"" by Mark Kurlansky did, but unfortunately it didn't and I gave up on it.I just wasn't very interested in the doings of the downtown New York rat colony observed by the author, and there wasn't enough narrative impetus to keep me hooked."
5,Great intro for Coop,"After laboring over Pop 485, Richard Perry blossoms in Truck. Sets the stage for Coop and has a smile or hearty laugh on hearly every page!"
3,Truck good but...,"I liked the book, but I just don't think the many ten dollar words added anything to the book, in fact they may have hindered more than helped. I felt the writer tried to pretend he is just another guy only smarter than all of us. I do recommend it though."
2,"Good, but not Great.","This is a good book for beginners, but I feel that you do need to be warned that there is ALOT of reading, and the print is rather small. The diagrams are not the best in the world, but the instructions are written just as the title states ""in plain English"". There is a great deal of details in this book regarding anything & everything that deals with Crocheting."
2,Glad I got it at the library,"I got four books at the library to try to learn to crochet. This one was the least helpful. The diagrams are almost useless, and the written descriptions will make a true beginner's head swim. I agree with what someone has said here--people learn differently, and if you are truly adept at turning words into actions, you might benefit from this book (although there are other books with more helpful written instructions, in my opinion). Most true beginners, however, will need more detailed diagrams (if only to check that what they are doing is correct).I can't testify to the helpfulness of this book to more advanced crocheters (which is why I gave it two stars rather than one)."
1,The Great Gatsby,"The Great Gatsby ended up being, not so great. I am a movie fanatic and found this to be one of the most boring films I have ever saw. I literally caught myself dozing off at times during this movie. I don't think that they should have had Redford or Farrow playing Daisy and Jay. They should have had new faces to play the parts, people who would have actually cared about the movie. The best played character in the movie was the store owner Wilson. He was very dramatic and the only one who kept me awake. Nick and Tom were also well portrayed. I wouldn't waste my money on this film if I were a viewer and I wouldn't carry this film if I were you Amazon.com, sorry."
5,Gatsby Review,It is unfortunate that the original is not on DVD yet but this is one of the more colorful versions.
5,Great Movie!,"The critics struck out on this one. This is a great movie that follows the book very closely. Redford, Farrow, and Waterston really bring this film to life. Visually loaded, the movie has all of the Gatsby excesses one might expect to see. Highly recommended, this is a classroom friendly version of arguably the best American novel ever written (exception Catcher in the Rye?)."
2,Read the book,"This adaptation does not do the novel justice. F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece is better left to the imagination. My opinion is not based on the quality of the actors (which was poor in some cases but not all). Rather, I am of the opinion that this movie, instead of focusing on the theme of The Great Gatsby, made the movie more of a soap opera starring Daisy and Gatsby and Tom. This may not be a fault peculiar to this particular film; I doubt that any director could adequately support Fitzgerald's theme. It cannot be conveyed on a film reel.The movie also made the idea of Gatsby's and Daisy's reunion seem too contrived, a problem which Fitzgerald managed to avoid.In short, the actual novel is a better choice than its film adaptation. If you must watch it, read the book first. At the very least do not substitute the movie for the book."
4,Excellent Instructional Videos,This seven disk series offers an excellent approach to using the TI'spire calculator using practical every day problems. My son quickly learned how to use his TI'Nspire to solve Linear Functions. Very useful and worth the cost.
2,Faeriecraft,It was pretty good. It didn't go into the elementals as much as I would have wanted and spent too much time on various types of meditation I am already familiar with.
3,Good enough.,"The book is a medium level book in differential equations. It is design for engineers. Acoording to the seller the book will have clean pages and actually it was not. since only need the book as a reference for one semester, it is enough but I was a little disappointed since the description said thah the book will be clean."
1,I Wish I Could Return It,"Yes, the topics I recognized seemed to be rehashed. Otherwise, much of it read like the premises to a science fiction story - I couldn't wrap my mind around it. Also, it was very wordy. This book was hard to follow. I didn't get out of it what I expected."
5,Star children come together . . .,Beautifully mind expansive. A true diamond. Made me realize that I am not crazy and that there are others who intend to change this matrix that we are all living in. Lets come together as one and create the paradise that earth was originally set up to be.
1,Disappointing,"I work in the marine industry and wanted to spend the extra money for a high quality radio instead of the cheap $99 radios the company issues. I decided to go with this ICOM, what a mistake. I can barely receive transmissions from .5miles and sometimes less. The transmitting capabilities are fine but for the price it is a let down. For a weekend warrior its probably not bad. I switched back to my $99 Standard Horizon which blow this out of the water.Stay Classy."
4,Great (albiet old) Guide,"A great travel guide to a part of the world that is not often covered in such detail. The book is eight years old (as of 2009) and so not much good any more for prices and hotel recommendations, but this it is such a wonderful resource for planning a route and planning where to make stops on a BAM voyage.The book also includes some great coverage of places north of the railway, including route planning information for a trip all the way to the Arctic Ocean.Good stuff here."
3,It is what it is,"Here's a rare case of a movie being better than a book. And it's not even that good of a movie But, if you love b-movies like me then you might be pleased with it. If you read the book and were disappointed with the ending and the last 100 pages, you'll probably like the movie because the ending was different and much better. And the absurdity of the last 100 or so pages was left out entirely. Also, if you're a Twin Peaks fan you'll enjoy The Giant and Laura Palmer's mother being main characters. I recommend to all lovers of Koontz and b-movies."
2,Good book for a historian.,"I love camping and eating by the fire and was looking for a good book on dutch oven cooking. This book is not it.The back cover states ""Woodruff perfected these recipes ... for more than 60 years as a scoutmaster ...""That period is 1929 to 1989, the publishing date.By today's standards, these recipes are dated. My son is a scout, and I have been on a number of scout camping trips - and believe me scouts mostly need simple meals to prepare. But Woody is too much into canned veggies, soups, and packaged mixes. You have to look long and hard to find a recipe in this book that uses fresh ingredients.I suspect that if Woody were alive today, given his obvious commitment to Scouting, he would update most of his recipes to reflect more of today's thinking about healthy eating and fresh food."
2,not worth it,"very general and limited book - if youre looking for medical astrology, dont look here."
3,Exhaustive References / Bibliography but Difficult to Read,"Hawthorne includes bibliography all over the place, but IMHO not the most readable commntary available. Better than Silva but not as helpful as Thurston, Lenski, Fee or O'Brien."
4,Smoking Gun,"While much of the material in this DVD has been covered before, there really IS a smoking gun, not revealed until near the end of the presentation. It is actually a somewhat shocking revelation about the first time our government learned it could successfully lie to the American people. For those who think such deception started with Kennedy's assassination, Roswell is where it began 16 years earlier. And they got away with it!"
4,Ae they out there,"This is one of the better Roswell d.v.d.I still remain mute,i don't believe it nor do i disbelieve it.When it happens to me than i'll know."
1,Roswell Mockumentary with Bryant Gumbel,"This film has Bryant Gumbel and the host. He must have needed a payday to be in it. He's never at Roswell but talks and walks in a hangar someplace and the ""B"" unit camera crew goes into the field. It solved no secrets, just re-hashed known facts. Not recommended for serious readers about the Roswell incident."
4,Great Surf from the Alternate Universe Down Under,"This is a great surf compilation that shows that Australia had it's own armada of surf music legends that could go toe to toe with their American brothers. I would even venture to say that the musicianship displayed on this disc is superior to most of the American fare from that era. While their may be few tunes that rival the timeless melodies of classics like ""Miserlou"", ""Pipeline"", Wipeout"" or ""Mr. Moto""; the rhythms are more complex and many of the players are more accomplished.This is a great sounding CD and all of the tracks are clear and detailed. Maybe there's slightly less attitude and garage than surf on this side of the pond, but the surf-vibe is alive and thrashing.If you love classic surf music you'll love the Atlantic waveriders on this disc."
2,Get the full-size doll...,"I don't know anything about bratz, but if you're looking for another figure skating doll collectable - SKIP this one and buy the larger version. Why? She has NO skates! You can't have a figure skating doll without SKATES!"
5,Some like it hot - like me!,"I bought this classic comedy for my wife because I managed to ween her off videos and into DVDs. It is one of the most funny movies to come out of Hollywood and includes three mega stars; Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe. I never tire of watching it and the humour is fresh at every viewing. If you want a classic movie at a competitive price buy this!"
3,An amusing movie,"While I would certainly call this an amusing movie, I cannot comprehend how it was chosen the ""greatest comedy of all time"". Frankly, I don't even think it is Lemmon's or Curtis's finest work. I far prefer ""The Fortune Cookie"", ""The Odd Couple"" or ""Good Neighbor Sam"" for Lemmon, and ""Operation Petticoat"" or ""The Great Race"" for Curtis.This is not to say that this movie isn't completely enjoyable...though the premise is too outlandish to be believable. To think that Marilyn (and the rest of the band) could not tell that Tony and Jack were two guys in drag is stretching reality way too far."
5,Outrageous Comedy!,"Some Like It Hot is one of the best comedies ever made! It is hillarious from the first frame to the last. The film centers around two men who run away from the law and dress as women. They end up in an all-girl troop of performers and the fun begins! A brilliant comedy, with great performances (epecially Jack Lemmon's), wonderful script, lovely songs, and, oh yes! Great costumes!!!"
1,"Some Like it Hot, Some Don't","In analyzing the plot of this movie, some things are immediately apparent. If men dressed as women are this popular, Janet Reno is a lock as Florida's next Mr. ah Ms. Governor. Also, an individual of confused sexual identity who is bewitched by a near-famous blonde? Shouldn't this be titled the Anne Heche story? Finally, how could anyone come up with a more contrived plot? This movie should elicit continual shouts of ""THERE IS NO WAY THAT WOULD HAPPEN."" The true movie viewer should require more...."
5,best classical movie ever! I love Jack Lemmon!,"Tony curtis can jump in the lake, but Jack Lemmon can swim in my pool any day! OKay, so that makes know sense. first time I saw it I watched it 3 times over in one sitting. never done that with any movie, occasionaly twice, but never thrice!"
4,A riot of laughter!,"This is a hilarious movie wherein two musicians accidentally witness a mob murder during the Prohibition era and have to consequently hide-out as females in an all girl band. With the lead singer being Marilyn Monroe, well, there are some hilarious scenes! I always feel sorry for Marilyn Monroe when I see her movies. I get the impression she doesn't fully comprehend the possible dangers that are out there when a woman is so overtly sensuous. And I definitely get that feeling in this movie. She's so naturally all woman, but unfortunately, in this world, that can lead to trouble. And well, I guess it did.Anyway, the movie is a riot of laughter. And Marilyn really shines."
5,Beautiful and Passionate!,"All the previous reviewers have done a fine job of describing this album, it's beautiful, the fact that she is not popular in America is a good thing, and something she should be proud of, means her music has style and taste!Sorry but R&B and rap have well overstayed their 15 minutes!"
1,Non-expert waffle. Better books on same theme exist,"Has the author of this book had prostate cancer? No, he hasn't (although he claims some relatives have had it). Is this author an expert in prostate cancer? No, he's not a surgeon, not an oncologist, not a urologist, he's not even a practising MD. I suggest buying the much clearer and better writtenSurviving Prostate Cancer without Surgery: The New Gold Standard Treatment That Can Save Your Life and Lifestyle. It's cheaper too, and written with the help of real experts."
1,Do not buy this book,"This author is on a campaign, a misinformed and poorly written campaign, against prostate surgery which, for many men, is by far the best choice. Do not buy this book under any circumstances. Even if you are tying to avoid surgery, you can get better information almost anywhere on the internet than is presented in this book."
3,"great music, crummy fidelity, sounds like low grade real audio source","As far as I know, no titles from the Eloise trio have made their way onto CD prior to now. If you're familiar with their fantastic Bahamian records, well, I would stick with them. YoYo records has taken the easy way out here and tried to dump one of their Decca albums (although it's even missing a song) onto CD. Based on the fidelity, it sounds worse than most bootlegs, likely recorded from a turntable and converted into a low fidelity digital format and robbing you of your money.I would wait this one out. Certainly their stuff has to make it cd sometime."
1,dont waste your money,not worth buying. poorly taped and the wemon in this movie will get on your nerves. the movie is like watching two old hens yacking while being filmed in the 1800's.
5,Surprised me!,"I hadn't heard of this movie but thought I'd seen everything Travolta had done over the years. I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the writing, acting and directing in this movie. It's old enough that you might happen upon it on a premium movie channel or OnDemand cable, and if you do, give it a watch. I would have paid to see it at a theater but I'm glad I happened across it on Amazon.com instead."
3,nice movie,"I brought this movie strickly on impulse from my work. It cost me $2.99, brand new (dvd). I'd never seen it before, but was very impressed. I know it is a TV movie, but nonetheless, it is very watchable. I can watch it several more times, in fact. After watching movies like these, you gain respect for independent films.There are bad reviews for this movie out there, but I say hire it out and make up your own mind. A Travolta classic!"
3,TECHNICAL DIVING COMPILATION,Nothing new and the price is too high for something apparently compiled from other sources.
4,Duro-med 360 Degree Swivel Seat Cushion,"I gave it as a gift. But the reports have been, it works well in the driver seat, of his car.The only thing to remember, you will have to readjust the car's seat."
3,Swivel Seat,"The seat works fine. I have stopped using it as there is not enough padding for my back side not to complain about the dicomfort of sitting on this for any period of time. I like the way it helps me sit higher but the pain (and that is the correct term)keeps me from using it at all. If I fold a towel over it, then I am sitting too high so I will give it away to someone with more fat down there than I have."
3,You get what you pay for,The songs are mostly redos by unknown groups trying to copy the original songs. My advise is to listen to the songs first. If you just want the song for songs sake then this is ok but if you want the original group and song pay for the original album.
4,A Sweet Little Gem!,"I was prepared for a drawn out, long-road-to-nowhere story.But I was pleasantly surprised by this funny, sweet little romatic comedy. Kate Hudson just sparkles in this little jewel. There are times, though, when you can see Goldie Hawn in her - a little unnerving.The plot was predictable but all the sweetness lies in the byplay between Kate and Matthew as they wwork out their competing agendas toward a common end.Light, frivolous, and fun!"
3,It was fine,"I chose three stars because although the movie was hilarious (I couldn't stop laughing) and charming, it's no less a tired old tale. It reminds of about a thousand other chick-flicks that have beautiful characters and a lovable plot and they're a dime a dozen. I did like the comedy, and the side characters were both fun and lovable. Although I wouldn't add it to my home collection, if you were just looking for a fun, cute comedy to pass the time, I say go for it."
2,I just didnt like it,"I really didnt like this movie, it is way too predictable, it reminded me too much of the movie ""Overboard"" because Kate Hudson acts just like her mother in this. This is nothing more than a date movie. So if you want to go out on a date. Then you can go see this."
4,RomCom,"This is the type of movie that Kate and Matt can do in their sleep, however this is funny and enjoyable. Donald Sutherland strikes just the right tone as the dad.Good looking people in bikinies, beautiful land and sea scapes, what's not to enjoy."
2,Commercials spoil it...,"This would have been a nice, romantic comedy if it hadn't been for the commercials. If you've seen any of the previews on TV don't buy it or rent it or anything. You've seen every good part of the entire movies wrapped in a spiffy 30-sec package.Sadly this happens with far too many movies, but this was one of the ones that I've seen that has been most spoiled by the previews. Seriously, tease us to want to see it with an appetizer, not the whole 7-course meal!"
3,Classic Romantic Comedy,"For a feel good factor, this film comes out tops. However, as a comedy i think it has little to offer - it's a bit predictable and the script is limited. As i watched it even i could think of better ways to secure a laugh. But if you're a fan of the actors in it, it's a must buy as the acting is really varied. As i said, with a better script this film could have been so much better. But as it is, it's just like any other romantic comedy - i'd say of about the same ""funnyness"" level of Meg Ryan's ""Kate And Leopold."" So, if you laughed at that......"
2,Enter cliches!,"I saw this movie after hearing that it was cute and funny and an overall good chick flick. I wish I could kick whoever told me that. It seemed to use every cliche in the book and was VERY predictable. I'm sorry, but I just can't give this more than two stars - and that's only because Matthew is good looking"
2,How to drag a painful movie out for 2 full hours,"Two great actors whose talents went to waste on a terrible plot and an unneeded second hour. Yes it has some funny parts, but it is more painful to watch than anything (think Meet the Parents). Do you like watching women tormenting men? Then this macabre movie is for you! And I adore Kate Hudson, but why doesn't she ever wear a bra?!! Just carrying on her mother's torch I suppose. Maybe when your boobs are small showing your nipples thru your clothes is almost as seductive as cleavage."
2,Typical Chick Flick,I was so excited when this one finally came out of the movie theaters and onto DVD. I was so depressed when it was no where near as good as the commercials made it out to be. There was spots where I was tempted to just turn it off. I eventually did so. I could never get past the visit to the guy's family.
4,Movie for Granddaughter,I bought this movie for my 18 yo granddaughter for her birthday. I have never seen this movie but she has and wanted it for her collection.
3,Funny; predictable.,"Entertaining movie. Great supporting cast. Matthew typically wooden, but funny. Can't say I haven't seen this movie done before. Overall enjoyable."
3,Must use newest Blue Ray program.,Needs the latest Blue Ray player software to view this DVD. Don't try Cyberlink if you need help from Customer Service.
5,THE PERFECT BOOK FOR LEARNING ABOUT PUPPETRY,"I found this book completely clear and practic. It tells how to make the puppet -any kind, also it talks about how many different kinds are there. It is very clar about how to make the stringing, the controls, all kind of controls. There are lots of variations for different functions. JUST WONDERFUL"
4,A Killer DVD!,"""You Kill Me"" is a great ""little"" movie about a Polish hit-man from a snow plowing family in Buffalo, NY. Played by Ben Kingsley, the title character is a drunk that has to go to rehab or be kicked out of the family. (most likely,killed). He moves to San Fran and joins AA. Gets a job at a funeral home and meets the girl of his dreams. If you like quirky independent films that are more story than showy, this movie is for you. Great performance by Luke Wilson as well. Much funnier than the title suggests, and one to savor with the rest of your collection."
4,Twisted Genius,"This is one of the funniest films I have seen in years. While it is dark humor at its darkest, there is a moral here, which is when you let the people in your life down you pay for it as much as they do. It's the contrast between the content of the film, of the dysfunctional mob family and the underlying message of hope that makes this movie work. Of course, the perfectly deadpan and always on target performances of the two leads take what could have been a painfully bad film in lesser hands and elevate it to comic genius. Highly recommnded."
2,For Fans Only,"Unless you are a hard-core Roger Corman or Jim Wynorski fan, stay away from this movie, especially the DVD version. It is in 4:3 format, and obviously taken from the VHS tape master. Very, very poor video quality.It's also just a dreadfully boring movie. At just over 80 minutes long, it feels like it's twice that long. You know a movie is bad when the commentary track is more interesting than the movie itself.For those of you who read the previous reviews, and might be interested because you think you are going to see ""all"" of NicoleEggert - sorry to disappoint you, but she uses a body double in those scenes. Don't feel bad, though; hopefully I just saved you from wasting your time and/or money on this movie."
4,A movie for Nicole Eggert's fan,"The movie is a classical horror movie but it is entertaning. It is quite good if you are a fan of the gorgeous Nicole Eggert because she plays two roles, the mother Morella and the daughter Lenora (main character). A must-have for every Nicole Eggert's fan (I am)!"
4,PUT IT together ...[he's]....STILL good.,"This is one of Jay-Z's best CDs. He gets on Nas and Mob Deep on the track ""Takeover"" but it is not as good or hard as Nas's track ""Ether"" on the CD ""stillMATIC"" when he says ""Rocafella died of aids that was the end of his CHAPTER, and thats the guy you chose to name your company AFTER,"" But the track ""takeover"" is still pretty good even if you do like Nas better like myself.This CD is deffinitely a MUST GET NO MATTER WHAT. ...I"
5,blue print,"Jay-z blue print was hard you can listen to the album without changing a track all 16 songs are hot take over he murder nas,people say jay-z is cocky and arrogant and have nothing really to say but jay-z is hip head honco rappers feel jay from 96 to 2003 and your name is still up there jigga you will be miss death before dishonour people can't say you didn't have an impact on hip hop after before you there was many after you there be none"
5,beautiful rap,"Jay-z's almost lost it after vol.3 and the dynasty, and if the Blueprint had been bad, he would have fallen out of the top ten. I never thought Jigga had as much charisma as Nas, but I could not front on his rap skills. The Blueprint puts him back on top of the game.The first track is a good introduction to the album. Next comes 'Takeover' a B+ track which takes shots at Mobb Deep and Nas. It was good but not nearly as good as Nas's song. 'H to the izzo' was alright but it got too much hype and I could not believe the Source called it the rhyme of the year.The notable tracks are 'Aint no love', 'Song Cry','All I need', and 'Renegade' which features Eminem. What was interesting was that Jigga was not scared to show his vulnerable side on songs like 'Song Cry'.The Blueprint will not appeal to people who like that commercialized nonsense that comes from Nelly and Ja Rule. I would reccomend listening to 'Stillmatic' and Cormega's 'the realness'."
1,Please Jigga I mean really,"First off people who like jigga are the same people who like the New york Yankees. Jay-Z does the same thing now the Yankees do. What they do is buy themselves greatness using money or their name. I hope these same people really judge this album by tru hip hop and not the Jay Z name someday. Second the production was what I expected.It was good cuz other people did it, but his lyrics have to be the weakest in the business hands down. He has no punchline in his lyric and no uniqueness. Listen to this album and that's proof enought to not get it. Most of the songs are a mess lyrically and he gets by by buying the best beats and spittin these horrible lyrics and mellow people will flock to buy the album. Recognize real talent not these fakes like Jay Z."
4,"Not a classic, but worth a buy...","Despite what others have been saying, this album is not a classic. It doesn't quite measure-up to Reasonable Doubt or other hip hop gems that deserve marks of five stars. However, it is an excellent album blending clever wordplay with nice beats and some ""deeper"" songs. It's probably Jay-Z's best album since Reasonable Doubt."
5,big r&b and hip hop fan here,"I remember buying this album and michael jackson's invincible on the same day back in fall 2001. Needless to say, I got my r&b and hip hop fix for that fall and needed to hear nothing else."
3,I just dont see nothing that is spectacular about it.,"I may just be a hater....but nothing about rap is classic anymore.....ever since MTV started making rap music into pop music....everything has gone downhill....just listen to the new DMX??? the new Ja RULE??? Jay-z??? FABolous??? All these ""highly"" anticipated albums are bricks....nothing classic or even dope about them......i think people just forgot how dope rap music used to be, so we just take what we can get... Atleast DRE is keepin it fresh with bad intentions, on the boulevard, and put it on me...other than him....nobody doin much...but maybe im just hatin......lata."
1,What am I worth if I don't go after overrated rap?,"GUYS, I DISCOVERED THE MOST AWESOME THING!!!! SOME BANDS HAVE AWESOME BEATS THAT THEY PLAY WITH REAL INSTRUMENTS!!!! IT IS SO AWESOME, YOU SHOULD ALL CHECK IT OUT!!!!! IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT JAY-Z STOLE ALL THE CREDIT/MONEY FOR.I'm so fcking sick of the ""I don't deserve to be poor gig.""Rap/Hip hop is the pinnacle (nadir for many) of manufactured music."
3,Good...But over rated,"This album is much better than any of his previous ones (besides reasonable doubt)and has top notch production. The lyrics are on point on many parts (although too simple for my taste) and they flow well (as they have always done). The main complaint with this cd is not the ratio of good songs to bad songs because there are more good songs than bad songs. Where this cd falls is the bad songs. Songs like Izzooo..., hola hovito, the rulers back, and jigga that n**gga are just bad and at some times extemely annoying. Usually with songs such like these it would make a cd really fall but songs like song cry are classics and the rest are really well put together too. What i'm trying to say is this is a good album but mad over-rated by the public (as is everything else that Jay-Z ever puts out). Listen to it before buying it. ""Don't believe the hype"""
4,Finally drops the crystal/bentley crap and comes correct,"This album is Jay's best work since Reasonable Doubt. It still doesn't reach a classic status like his debut, but is still a worthy album. I really didn't feel IZZO to start out, but the song grows on you after hearing it a lot, catch myself singing it. Lots of great songs, and not really any bad songs on the disk. As far as the beef with Nas, like Nas said in I am.. ""The best supposed to clash at the top"" I really think there is respect between them and they'll end up selling more cds for each of them by feuding so is probably just a marketing maneuver. Nas's stillmatic song is dope, and can't wait to see if he can get back to another illmatic album, hopefully he can learn something from Jay here. Renegades with Eminem is a great song, as is Girlz. There are very few large rappers with skills out there so its good to see this one can still hold his own. Cop the album."
3,Easliy his best since Hard Knock Life Vol. 2,"Jay-z has been an enigma of sorts. His first three albums, in my opinion, are some of the best in the history of hip hop. Ever since he became TRL friendly, the quality of his music has gone down steadily, which leads us to the Blueprint. First off, this has the worst release date of all time(Sept. 11), but it is very solid. He shows off his lyrical mastery off and on, in particular on Renegade,Song Cry, and Izzo. But the Takeover is the shining moment, where he strikes at Nas and Mobb Deep. Hopefully he will get it together. Hopefully."
2,Allright,"The first tape is good,but the other it stunk! Three stooges fans you won't like the tape 2! Stay away from tape two! It rarly has the three stooges!"
5,they are the bigest STAR in the world,"ANTHII haven't word to tell about <THE KELLY FAMILY> they are so good and so sensitive and i believe that they're songs speaking in all hearts.Still i thing that ANGELO-PADDY-PATRICIA and JIMMY can make an atmosphier so beautiffoul and loving espesially ANGELO and PADDY who every girl fill so beautiffoul when they listening they're songs. For excamble when i listening the songs<I CAN'T HELP MY SELF>,<FELL LOVE WITH AN ALIEN> and so ellse i fill so good. <<THE KELLY FAMILY IS THE BIGEST STAR IN THE WORLD>>"
5,From Their Hearts,"I haven't gotten this album yet, because I just ordered it. I'm sure it's going to rock like the other ones I have. I've listen to a few of their songs from this album on a few web-sites, and WOW! -- It sounds so cool. Angelo's voice sounds amazing. I can not wait to get it! And they do sound more mature. :B"
2,"Purchase ""Zoom Tour Live"" Instead","While I haven't seen the Wembley show on DVD, I know from the VHS version that the sound is not up to DVD standards, and the video effects look like something from a local cable show (can you say ""Wayne's World"").Zoom Tour Live however is incredible!! The lineup may not be the same as Wembley, but with Jeff Lynne at the helm, it is still a show to remember. The songs are fresher, the sound quality incredible, and the cello players are BABES :)If you want to live in the 70's, and like bell-bottoms and the classic ""hamburger"" stage, but Wembley... but make sure you buy Zoom as well."
3,I was at this show!,We had fairly good seats in the second section back from the stage on the floor. This was ELO's first night at Wembley on the Out of the Blue tour way back in 1978. Fantastic show. Unbelievable excitement just being there.I bought this DVD in the hopes of re-living the experience - but the sound is horrible.
1,Garbage,"The color is great, but it is hard to believe how negligent and incompetant they were in creating their widely sold printers (in all Staples stores,etc). Ridiculously noisy, extremely long warm up cycle, which occurs EVERY time you open the lid, etc. Constant ""jams"" because the rollers do not pull the paper properly, no way to retsart after a ""jam"" except to lift the lid and wait for the 2 minute warm up cycle, using anything but the cheapest thin paper will cause all kinds of pseudo jam problems, will cancel your job for you (thanks), and very bizarre preferences in terms of matching paper type as listed in printer, with paper type in your software.. If they dont match, it is a printer error (duh), causing you to take 2 or 4 extra steps every time you print."
2,Not really a large door,This is more of a medium size door. It says for dogs up to 100 lbs. but my dogs are about 75 lbs. and they hated it. They would hit their knees and/or back side when going in or out. Had to get rid of it (waste of my money) because my two dogs stopped using it. Went with a PetSafe door where a large door is an actual large door.
2,change of review,"My son wrote the first review right after we got the V-drop. He loved playing with it for 1 day but then the device that brings the car up to the top stopped working. I couldn't believe it. He suggested that we bring it back to the store so we could get something else. So that's what we did, but I said no more hot wheels stuff for awhile. This was one of many Hot Wheels birthday presents."
2,Poor quality control.,"Looks nice, seems to be heavy enough steel (not easily bent). The problem with the ones I received is the holes that the screws thread into were drilled out too large on 3 of the bars, making the screws too small. Will go to the hardware store to see if larger screws still work."
4,The band hits the mark,"I was so looking forward to the release of this album and I went out and got it the day it was released. AUDIOSLAVE is a great rock album in a time when what dominates the soundwaves is so manufactured. I think this album is a true musical gem. Because of the history of the band members, there was so much hype regarding this band, it would be almost impossible to live up to it. While the band didnt, they came pretty darn close to doing that. The album starts off with 5 killer tracks: COCHISE, SHOW ME HOW TO LIVE, GASOLINE, WHAT YOU ARE, LIKE A STONE. I just love putting this disc in a cranking the stereo loud. The middle of the disc kind of just plays along, the songs are not bad, they just dont jump out and scream for you to listen to them. I also enjoy listening to last part of the album startimg with BRING EM BACK ALIVE. Overall, this is a true solid rock effort from the band, and I think that it is a good disc to have"
3,this is it?,"Okay, for all five-star reviewers out there, imagine what you would give this album if it weren't Chris and Rage. Uh huh, thought so.Names can only carry an album so far. Eventually you should have the MUSIC to back it up. Cochise gets you up and running, but they're stuck in third gear the rest of the way! Am I the only one who wishes that this album rocked more like the ""Louder Than Love"" days of old?There's nothing memorable here. Still, it's better than most of the stuff out nowadays (Avril Lavigne anyone?). Maybe they'll wake up on the next album."
3,Havent we heard this before??,"Sounds like Soundgarden with a dash of Rage against the Machine thrown in. Man, Chris Cornell has WAY TOO MUCH influence over this band! Nothing new here. If you like Soundgarden, you might dig this one. If you like RATM stick with them as you might not like this new group. CD overall is average at best."
5,True Rock Is Back...,"Not many bands these days can say they are a true rock band, Audioslave can. When you first hear Cochise your first thought will be, ""Man, these guys sound like RATM."" you couldn't be further from the truth. Audioslave gives us a breath of fresh air in knowing that good rock is still around. Pick this CD up when you have a chance."
2,please!,"I mean, with all the rockers on this album, why did it turn out so lame and predictable? Its basically Sound Garden. The songs are all forgettable and the ballads are too many and boring. You would think that this would be one of the greatest albums of the year? Cornells vocals are still mellifluous and amzing and Morello's guitar rocks............but it just doesnt combine well to make a great album..........boo hoo"
3,Ok so i was harsh lol,"Yeah i was harsh when i completely had a big go about these guys, they obviously have talent, it's just that i never really got into Nirvana, or any of that kind of vocal performance, so yeah it's gotta be 3 stars, cos i don't actually see it bein much more than an average album... once again you have to hear it to know if you like it, if this is your kind of music (RATM crossed with Sound Garden vocalist fused to make a commendable effort at a new sound) then by all means i advise you to perhaps give it a listen..."
5,Best of two defunct bands,"You wouldn't expect a Soundgarden front-man and the instrumentalists from Rage Against the Machine to seamlessly mesh together as well as they have in this debut. The music itself is true to Rage's roots, but Chris Cornell throws in some great modern rock ballads in ""Like a Stone"" and ""I Am the Highway.""This is powerful stuff, best listened to at high volume. Highly recommended for fans of the former bands."
5,awesome cd,"from start to finish this cd is awesome. from the popular cochise and show me how to live and like a stone, everything is wonderful! some of the slow songs are kinda boring, but there are only 2 or 3 really slow songs on the cd. morello on guitar is just amazing."
3,don't quite live up to the hype,"I like this band fine, don't get me wrong. The instruments all have that distinctive rage against the machine quality that everyone can recognize. Unfortunately, this gets taken away from by the vocals of Chris Cornell (formerly of soundgarden). The guy has a good voice, but it just isn't THAT good. Sometimes he is singing with a very listenable almost aaron lewis mixed with kurt cobain quality. However, other times, the man sounds like he has a freaking cat lodged in his throat. This is some good grunge and i listen to it every now and then, but it doesn't give me the same thrill that rage against the machine did (i was never much of a fan of soundgarden). Oh well. buy it. or don't. Some standout tracks on here are ""like a stone"", ""show me how to live"", and ""gasoline"". have fun."
5,Refreshing Innovation,"A great album! Formed by the union of former Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell and the former musicians of Rage (Tom Morello, Tom Commerford, & Brad Wilk), AUDIOSLAVE is neither of the former bands. While sharing similarities with the two it stands out as an origional musical creation. Chris Cornell's introspective lyrical poetry and soaring vocal talent, is effortlessly combined with the funk rock groove of Tom Morello's guitar artistry.This is a CD which sounds better every time you hear it. You won't tire of this CD. As a musician (vocals and piano) I can say that I'm impressed. TRUE MUSIC! If you have a chance, see them live!"
3,Good CD,"I hate Rage and I was never into Soundgarden, so These guys are really new to me. I decided to give the album a try when my friend levi told me Tom was his favorite guitarist and alos becausemy friend was listening to the CD at school almost every day. I got it, and I listened. There are some great numbers, and I think more bands should head in this direction instead or numetal or retro crap... but I just didn't feel this album as a whole. Sort of sloppy when conceived with a good deal of generic filler. I will be looking forward to their next music outing together, that is if they do one."
4,Seemingly Underated,"I am a semi-new Soundgarden fan. I picked up SuperUnknown a few months ago and loved it. I then bought Down on the Upside and didn't care for it as much. As for Rage, I don't own any of their albums, but my friend listens to them all the time.I echo everyone sediments that Audioslave does indeed ROCK! The lyrics and vocals are great, probably because Chris Cornell didn't play guitar on the album, he focused on the song writting and singing. As for the guitars, it's the same grand led zeppelin inspired riffs and strange videogame sound effects that you have come to know and love from rage.Altogether, I really like this album. Its only faults are that some of the songs sound similiar. I found myself trying to sing along with a song, only to find out that it was a different song. Other than that small complaint its a very good album. If you like Soundgarden or Rage it deffinatly warrants a purchase."
5,STANDING UNDER PRESSURE,"first things first... this is neither Rage Against the Machine, nor is it Soundgarden... it's even better! the huge riffs that Morello and company lay down beneath Cornell's crooning and whaling is what will make it one of the best albums of the year. i now have even more respect for the ex-Rage trio when i hear them slow it down with a mesmerizing jazzy tune as Chris's vocals chill you out... but then comes the fat bass lines and huge guitar licks that we all know so well. as fans, we get the best of both worlds, what more can you want? what an amazing debut album... the hype is real... GET IT NOW !!!"
2,nothing close to rage,"I was really excited when I heard that Rage was getting a new lead singer, because in my opinion Tom Morello is one of the most gifted guitar players out there. However I was throughly dissapointed with this album...to be blunt: Thank you, Chris Cornell, for absolutely ruining what used to be one of the best bands in music today. Cornell knows how to do two things: scream, and scream louder. He ruins any creativity that Rage used to have and lacks the versatility De la Rocha gave to the group. Audioslave's bassist and drummer are nothing special, and without De La Rocha throwing in his mix of funk and hip hop, Audioslave is simply Soundgarden part two, which doesn't appeal to me at all."
5,A Must Purchase CD 10 Stars+++++++++++,"This cd in great. The chemistry between Chris Cornell and the former members of Rage Against the Machine is intense. This group is definitely the greatest new band. If you liked Soundgarden and Rage, then you will absolutely love this group.Don't miss out on the experience. A+++++++++++++++++++"
4,audioslave..,"Well for starters this cd is breath of fresh air!! With all the ... that MTV and FM radio tries to cram down our throats, this cd just stands out. It retains musical value and its just good to hear Chris Cornells voice in some new stuff.. The guitar synth solo is nice in ""like a stone"". Im glad that Rage and Chris teamed up. I hope it lastsMike @ guitarpiks.comSounds really good ad 120DB...."
1,Rage will never be forgotten,I don't like it. without zach de la rocha the band will never be the same.
5,The new sound to become a slave to.,"Audioslave is a NEW band that features the talents of Chris Cornell (of Soundgarden fame) and Tom Morello, Tim Commerford, and Brad Wilk (of Rage Agains the Machine). This new band l;eads an ultra sonic assault on the ears of music listeners everywhere. Chris has the vocals of a screaming banshee and the music is perfect to detail the power behind these musicians.Cochise has already become a great radio staple but songs such as ""Show me how to live"" ""exploder"" ""light my way"" are only a few more tracks that will make this album a great addition to hard music lovers everywhere. This album is highly recommended to help blow up speakers and soundsystems everywhere."
4,Almost Medicore,This is a pretty good Cd. I really enjoy Gasoline and Cochise. This album however does not reflect the full potential this band can achieve. The lyrics have lost their political side and its mainly the Chris Cornell lyrics common to his Soundgarden albums. Anyway highly reccomended!
3,Everything sounds the same on here,"The three hits from this album, ""Cochise"", ""Like a Stone"" and ""I am the Highway"" are all good, but not great. Chris Cornell's voice has clearly gotten better since Soundgarden, but he doesn't do his signature yell nearly enough. The instrumentals just seem lazy to me, and don't live up to Rage standards. Also the eleven other songs seem to be trying to imitate one of the three songs I have listed already.I give the CD three stars because it still is quality rock music, and sadly better than 95% of the other Rock music out there today."
2,Ugh,"I thought I would like this CD based on the songs that get radio play, but I was sorely disappointed! On the more melodic songs, Chris Cornell's voice just ruins the entire thing, plus he can't carry a melody unless he's yelling. Nasty, this Cd is just gross. It's Rage with a new singer - wow, that's really original. I suggest writing some more original lyrics and creating a new sound, not just cashing in on the old sounds of rage and soundgarden. That shows originality alright."
2,To sum it up in one word -WEAK,"I was curious to see how this version of Rage would sound and after hearing most of the tracks, I concluded this band falls short of the powerfull exhilerating standard that The Zach RATM set. Chris Cornell's vocals are bad. Why does this guy get such praise for that high whiney voice?. Its annoying as hell.Anyway this band is weird, I dont know what to make of them. When listening to the old RATM I felt like kicking the sh-t out of someone. Their music had an empowering presence.Audioslaves music however, seems like some self pitty bull sh-t.Bring back Zach or Get Chuck D on vocals. We need someone with some balls to sing"
5,Sophistication Transforms Rage,"An unbelievable sophisticated album. Cornell's influence on the remaining three members of Rage Against the Machine is great. I think in many ways, Zack de la Roche's departure lets the band develop in ways they could not have. del la Roche pushed them towards rap, while current, is primitive and not the right vehicle for a guitar/bass combo that rivals any other in history. Morello's exploratory licks really need the heavy blues base that is apparant in this album. I will not waste time with comparisons to Rage or Soundgarden. Instead look way back to Black Sabath & Zeppelin."
1,Very Overrated,"I bought this snare drum brand new as soon as it came out about 7-8 years ago. I had sold it within weeks. Poor projection despite its shell material along with a fairly flat and lifeless tone. (And that piercing overring is NOT tone). A very limited tuning range.As it is not a true piccolo, it's hard to get that crack that one associates with a shallower drum; but due to the combination of shell material and the shallower depth of shell one finds it hard to get a fatback style tone either. All I can say is try before you buy. I'm sure this drum will suit someone else perfectly. Just wasn't for me."
5,true to life,this show actually depicts the justice system for what it is. It includes all it's many flaws which makes for such interesting viewing. It also includes a tangled web of interpersonal relationships that go beyond just the workplace but to the bedroom. My b/f and I were so sad to see this show go :(
5,About Time...,"It's about time, finally, a preparatory study guide for the Social Studies Content Knowledge test, 0081!!! First rate job by Dr. Pate and I know that it will prepare for my upcomming exam. A suggestion: an audio version would be most helpful for busy folks with families and jobs, however, I must admit that it probably wouldn't be cost effective to produce."
1,This is A TERRIBLE BOOK,"As other reviewers have mentioned the book is full of grammatical, logical, factual and procedural errors. The answer sheets are missing numbers. Several questions contain factual errors. Some questions provide erroneous rational or wrong answers in the explanation section. The guide is poorly written, poorly produced and simplistic. However, if you would like a few good laughs at questions so ineptly formed that they are actually quite humorous; dive right in."
1,Don't use this one!,"I purchased this product from a bookstore, but found it to be such a horrible product I had to let others know about it. Like everyone else, I hoped it would help me prepare for the Praxis II exam. After taking heavy Social Studies courses through college, I was very disappointed in the some of the Content Review sections. I took an entire semester on the Renassiance and Reformation and the book provided this period with 9 sentences. I found many typos and errors in the book (see other reviews for discrepancies in questions). The worst part I found however was to not be able to judge how I did on the practice test. The book provides no scoring guide to give you a range as to what your score will fall under. Don't make the same mistake I did, purchase a different book!"
3,Item pretty decent,It has two full length tests in it. They are somewhat realistic when compared to the actual test. It does also include some broad background material for studying purposes and broadly explained explanations for the correct answers. It was a little vague but I think it helped me at least a little bit before my test.
2,Virtually Useless,"I just took the Praxis II Social Studies Content Knowledge test just the other day and I must admit - I am not particulary feeling very confident after using this book as a review/ study guide. Granted my degree is in history, but the book itself (which may I add took two weeks to get, receiving it three days before the test when they stated up to 4 business days) was virtually useless.I found so many grammatical errors, misinformation, and down right wrong answers to the questions stated. The test had I believe maybe three questions from the Cliff Notes let alone majority of it was on gov't, behav sciences, and econ. The book in my opinion is not worth the money unless you want to use it as a quick reference but I would recommend using another form of study guide that has its information relative and up to date."
1,not pleased,"I ordered this item for a Christmas gift. The description read that it was in really good condition, so I ordered it. It did arrive promptly, but it was in poor condition. It looked like someone had spilled a drink on it and the pages were all wrinkled and even the cover was damaged in the same way. If I had had more time to order another one, I would have sent this one back. I had to apologize for the condition of the book and thankfully it was to my daughter who understood my dilemna. I will be reluctant to order any more books. This one came from A Kinder Place. They should be more kind to their books and recipients!!"
5,Capturing A Great Artist In Person,"This recording captures a great player, Woody Shaw in top form leading a wonderful group in live performances. The recorded sound is quite good as well. Woody and the group stretch out on some cooking tunes like Ginseng People, Organ Grinder and Seventh Avenue. Little Red's Fantasy is more a of ballad but this one of Woody's classic compositions. I was fortunate enough (old enough?) to have seen this group perform in person back in the early 80's. The music was fantastic. This album (and the other Live releases from High Note) capture the feeling of the group well. Woody Shaw was fabulous trumpet player. He was a great soloist and leader. He is greatly missed. This album reminds of what a wonderful artist he was."
2,Average at best,"I bought this CD because I have her previous release, and I am truly dissapointed.In all truth, 'Jennifer Paige' (her first CD) was not really a masterpiece, but for a first release, it showed promise. Her voice is nice, and there were lots of catchy tunes (what you'd expect from a pop album), but 'Positively somewhere' makes you wonder where that somewhere is, exactly.The CD is one long list of flat tracks (12 in all). No single one stands out. I guess she was trying to play it safe, but the finished product came out quite lame.Guess I'll wait for the next one...and even then I'll try to listen to as many tracks as I can before buying it...!"
1,Disappointment,"This is definitely the ""Worst of Barry Polisar."" I am a music teacher and have used his music before with children. This is so bad I cannot find one song to use. I played it once, and will not even play it again."
5,Alessandro Safina (Rlease 1),"Safina is outstanding! What comes across is his love of music and lyrics - I have played this CD so much, I think I'll need to order another copy.If you are in a relationship or are working on one, this is the CD to have...."
1,"Beg, borrow or steal the 1957 original",This story has been made into a movie at least three times. Don't waste your time or money with this awful remake. The earlier version with Traci Lords is OK.. but the original is one of the forgotten classics of the 1950's.. There are often DVD or VHS copies available on EBAY. The quality of these transfers is not wonderful... but the movie is great.
1,"Not Corman...or Corman,s Corman.","This film has nothing to do with the Traci Lords remake or "" Not of This Earth"" 1957/The 1957 film starred Paul Birch and Beverly Garland.The only interesting point here is the 28 years between the Corman film and his own remake.( exposing a true sign of the times)"
2,A great disapointment,"While showing signs of thorough research, this book is peppered with errors and generally flawed by the author's extreme bias against airpower. A more evenhanded approach to the subject matter could have produced a winner from the material available but this is just another pseudo-scholarly rant against US involvement in SEA."
3,CHANGING.....,"If you're looking for the classical thrash metal these guys have been doing for the last 2 decades,first you gotta have some facts straight.This is an experimental GRINDCORE/HARDCORE ep,style R.D.P. would embrace afterwards in full, changing their classical sound for good and ever).But don't be fooled,this is an energetic,crude and raw ,in your face,demolishing work by the band,despite the poor production."
3,Not for preschoolers,"This isn't a bad game, it's just too hard for preschoolers. My son is almost 5 and couldn't play it. Heck, I couldn't play it. For 3-5 year olds, I liked Jonah much better."
3,Excellent Climbing movie but bad DVD transfer,"When I found a copy of K2 on DVD I was really excited. However, when I came home and watched it I was very disappointed about the film tranfer to DVD. The picture looks a bit clouded and soft. During some of the darkers scences I could see pixels in the character's movement and background. The sound is Ok but not too impressive. The DVD has very little extras. Even though the DVD is disappointing it doesn't take away from the incredible climbing scenes. This is a great climbling movie despite the DVD flaws. Wait for a better release if it ever happens."
5,I thought the book was great!!!,"I got the book from the high school library two years ago, I'm now out of school, but I wrote a few down and have tried a few of them, they are delicious!!!"
5,A great commdy,"I loved just shoot me when it was frist on tv, and I'm happy now that it's been buoght out on dvd, I'm relly looking foward to season 4."
4,Great,I watched this show religiously every week when it was on so I know when I get around to watching it again it will be just as addictive
3,this is a bad @$$ movie,"I loved this movie. maybe it wasn't as good as SLC Punk, but it was still good. but the only thing bad about this movie is that is goes against true anarchist because in this movie a few of them are hippys or what ever there called. and they hate disctrution and stuff. what is up with that. if you really want to know what a real and true Anarchist is then watch SLC Punk, maybe you'll learn something."
1,this movie sucks!,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life (and I'm one to usually get into just about any movie).It confuses the viewer of what anarchy truly is.It's contradicting.Then it tries to make it seem like being right wing is the only way of life.Not to mention it's boring.There were a couple of intresting scenes,other then that it's boring.The ending makes it stupid,just like how it did in ""SLC Punk"" (which at least, was decent compared to this movie).Don't even waste the $3 it takes to rent this movie."
1,derivitive waste of time,"My girlfriend started watching this while I was in the other room. I walked in, watched one scene and said,""What, for the first scene of this did they flash the definition of anarchy?"" Yes, this pedantic piece ... reads like a none too subtle right-wing rebuttal of Fight Club. The leader is caricatured as a pedophile, and the idealistic young rebels soon descend into drug use, petty crime, and eventually jail time. Fortunately the main character is redeemed by a ... young republican co-ed, and he rediscovers the joy of borgeouis sterility just in time. This is a pedantic, stereotype-ridden ..., rent it if you feel like doing your own humorous critique, but for god's sake don't waste your money buying it..."
4,Takes me back to a special place,"WOW! I had forgotten these songs. This was really good music and it wasn't ""new wave elevator music"" like a lot of the smooth jazz we currently have. Makes me want to light up and chill! Gotcha! Incense"
3,Good...not great.,"One less star than their sophomore effort which was one less start than their debut. Some great songs on here, but overall, it just starts to get repetitive. Obviously, Ian's still got it as far as lyrics, but I think they need to bring somebody back from the first album....someone had to come up with all those creative riffs and bleeps...they certainly aren't on this album. I'm afraid ASU is falling into the tired cliche of the Christian music industry. Too bad."
2,Disappointing...Deserves 2.5 (if there were half-stars),"While this CD has some pretty good songs, it is very poorly produced (the guys recorded part of it in a hotel room...) and it just can't compare to their earlier CDs. If you can get past the production, then by all means go for it; All-Star United is a great band, but I personally recommend their earlier CDs over Revolution."
3,A Must for Michael Crawford Fans!i,"Michael Crawford chose some of Disneys most beautiful and memeorable songs to put in this new collection, but I have never been a fan of Michael Crawford. I will say he does have the strength and emotion that a singer needs but what about quality. I just don't don't care for the sound of his voice, and listening and I caught myslef laughing at his version of Reflection from Mulan. If you know the Christina Aguilera version some of you will listen to it and laugh right along with me, hearing him sing ""Who is that man I see, staringn straight, back at me"". However, his duet with Sherie Rene Scott on If I never Knew You is breathtaking and worth getting this cd for that song alone(the only reason I got this CD..Sherie Rene is phenomenal) Other highlights include You'll Be In My Heart, and The Lion King Medley. I do recommend this album for all Michael Crawford fans and Disney fans. You will probably love it."
5,Sexteen tons inolvidable,Los mineros del mundo la cantaban sin importar el idioma. Es un himno burlesco a la explotación del minero
5,Funniest Movie Ever!,"This movie came as expected, perfect condition, new in box. This is one of the funniest, yet hardest movie to find anywhere. I was glad Amazon was helpful yet again. I recommend it to anyone who likes to belly laugh."
4,Pure Luck DVD,"This is a very funny DVD. I had rented it years ago and really enjoyed it.This guy has really the poorest luck!. Its just extremely funny and full of laughs.Clean, no gross words or nudity or sex - just excellent!"
5,Very Funny,"This has got to be one of the funniest movies of all time! It is one of my favorite movies and I have seen it so many times, it never gets old, always as funny as the first time. If you haven't seen it, it's a must! If you have seen it, see it again and again...."
2,Globe itself is fine. Stand is flimsy.,"The globe itself is fine. The stand is so flimsy it arrived already broken. (I didn't damage it while removing it form the box; before I opened the box, I could see the globe lying at the bottom with the stand broken off through the side of the box.)I also wish it showed a physical scale rather than just noting that the scale is 1:32,000,000."
1,Poor Quality,"First off, I knew the globe was small, but it was still smaller than I expected. Just keep in mind that this is not close to a full size globe.I read the other reviews on these style globes stating that the stand was poor quality and breaks easily, but I figured it didn't matter since the globe would just sit on my desk that wouldn't be an issue.I even read one review that said the stand was broken when the product arrived, but I figured this was just bad luck.unfortunately mine came broken also, and while the globe itself is nice it's useless with a broken stand. The arm of the stand is just too flimsy. I will be returning this, taking similar style globes off my wishlist, and finding something else. I would recommend against this product."
3,Works,This pencil is ok. At first I was happy with it but after awhile I find I'm not that thrilled. It kinda leaves flakes (if you will) and you have to brush them off with an eyebrow brush. If I had paid four bucks for it I wouldn't mind but $18 then another almost $10 for shipping- I don't think so. It works and it's ok but it's not magic.
2,Remastered ?,"Great songs , great band, where are they now ?Burning vinyl records on cd's ! Sound is poor. It seems like a poor home recording from mint condition LP's.Songs are great, I wish I could get a good cd of Glass Moon, but these cd is PIRATA."
5,WOW!,"I don't get the people saying this had bad sound reproduction. It sounds great on headphones on in my stereo.I first bought the firet Glass Moon LP when I was 7 years old at a Garage Sale for 50 cents. I never heard of them but I thought the cover was cool. I fell in love with the music.I was so happy when this was put onto CD.Glass Moon was one of those rare rock 'n roll tragedies. They should have been at the top of the charts. But, whether it was poor management or not enough advertising, they never made it big but I am just happy to have this music on CD. And YES, it sounds great!"
2,This Man Just Amazes Me!,"So okay, Marilyn Manson. Obviously freaky and corny. Has exploited death and depression and the mounds of suffering teens everywhere for upwards of ten years now. To me, his music sounds like someone banging a garbage can with a very big stick. To you, perhaps this is the most innovative stuff around!The song registers somewhere between confusing and utterly pointless. The lyrics are as follows:mumble mumble mumble (profanity)(profanity)(profanity)(profanity) mumblemumble (profanity) TEENS!mumble mumble TEENS!(profanity)(profanity)(profanity)YEAH! YEAH! YEAH YEAH YEAH!Wow! That was a real mind-trip wasn't it? The only reason I give this two stars is because Marilyn (or whatever it is he goes by) has somehow kept his public depressed and deluded for a record period of time! ..."
4,Great Fit,"Love the styling love the build quality. They have been standing up strong for the past 6 months with LOTS of miles under them by now. I wear them not for their looks but their comfort on a rough construction site and if i want to go for a quick bike ride, i whipe them off and they shine like new. Good buy."
4,What an awesome gift!,"This is an absolutely beautiful instrument that plays extremely well. The design, details, and strong make demonstrate it's excellent quality. I am extremely pleased with this purchase and so was the recipient who received it as the gift he never expected."
3,SOME FLAWS IN THE ENDING,"The film is well photographed, very well edited and fairly well acted, but I feel that there are several flaws in the screenplay, mostly in the ending.Kerry's boyfriend who should have been the first one to be questioned by her friend, in part because of his erratic behavior, but also because boyfriends and husbands are always the first suspect when a woman dies, disappears and you never hear from him.The scene towards the end about the rape and the killing of Kerry by the bartender comes out of nowhere and does not make much sense. Of course we knew that the killer could not be Patrick, the unbalanced guy who had a crush on her, but something subtle should have directed us towards the real killer way before the ending, so that it is not so abrupt and hard to believe."
3,"Includes AOR hit ""Nicole""","TWO ALBUMS ON ONE CD.***""American Exce$$"" was Point Blank's big moment and included included a sizable AOR hit Nicole - you'll remember the very memorable driving rhythm. The album has great production for the era and another minor radio song, Let Me Stay With You Tonight. Extra points for awsome album art.***""On a Roll"" also featured two minor AOR radio tracks, Great White Line and the title track. Though, perhaps more memorable, is the introspective deep cut, Gone Hollywood - Just as American Exce$$ had awsome artwork, On A Roll has one of the wost covers of the 80s.FYI - AOR stands for Album Oriented Rock, a very sucsessful FM radio format in the late 70s and early 80s. ...Post disco, pre Madona. Quite a lot of these stations evolved into Classic Rock stations as the format died in the late 80s and early 90s. Point Blank is one of the many bands that were sucsessful in the AOR era, but were excluded from most classic rock programing."
4,Almost Perfectly Written!,"Loved this book overall. Thought it had a little bit of cheesiness, but the story was very sweet and enjoyable. Enjoyed the book so much that after reading it in a day I purchased the last two books in the trilogy and read them the same weekend. The Perfect trilogy is the perfect light romantic read."
4,Almost perfect,Good book. Seemed to be very light romance without much plot. Characters were very interesting. Main character did a lot of crying.
1,"Listed under ""Christian Fiction"" - NOT Christian Fiction","I learned from this purchase that you should ALWAYS preview a book before purchasing it! It was listed under ""Christian Fiction"". It is NOT a Christian book!! I only read a couple of chapters when the language and sex showed up. A waste of my money."
3,Just ok,It definitely wasn't one of those books that I can't put down. It was good but not great. Not sure if I will even read the other books in the trilogy.
4,Just Perfect!,I won't go into a summary of this book since others already did so. I don't write many reviews but I wanted to for this particular book. The opinions of its readers were so different that I needed to add mine. I thought this book was just perfect. It kept my attention all the way through it. I don't understand some of the low ratings. One reviewer called this book boring and high school. Not so. The intense feelings of the characters from high school into adulthood was very believable to me. I highly recommend this book.
1,A Christian's Point of View,"I am a christian and I read this book. I find it totally inappropriate, it is against alot of my beliefs. It is saying sex before marriage is ok when it is not in any way plus it uses alot of curse words. Overall I will not recommend this book to anybody I know."
4,Fantastic!,"Character interaction and development is ideal. No loose strings or cross plots to cause confusion. You can see the struggles, both emotionally and personally each character goes through. You can feel the internal turmoil the characters go through and their interwoven emotion of memories."
3,Mediterranean Cook Book,"The cook book is a middle of the road cook book with no real insights to the Mediterranean Heart diet. In fact, a good basic Italian, Middle Eastern, or Greek cook book would be better - like the Essentials of Italian Cooking and The Eastern Mediterranean CookBook."
3,Just Add Water,I think this book reafirms what I have felt all my life. I find myself also able to concentrate on something for a long time.I think this book is a good beginning but hardly a breathtaking book.
5,//knew this was coming//,"first I would like to say that seeing this movie reminded me of another one that was similar to this, in a fricken awsome way,but back to the point, the movie had killer cool action and graphics and the story line was better than the first movie though I cantdeni that the first movie had alot of flaws, but the 2 movie had (this is just what I thought I respect other respons) no flaws in it because the graphics and the story line also the charactors were clear and understandable, the reason I thought it was a well made movie was is because the hole thing made sense and fit together really well like when the knew screamers were mistaken for hostagesby the soldiers, any ways I thought it was good."
3,better then expected,"better then i thought it would be, if you like screamers you will at least want to watch this, of course its not as good as the first, but still a watchable movie.compare it to starship troopers 2, not nearly as good as starship troopers, but i still enjoyed watching it..."
3,Not a Bad Sci-Fi/Horror Flick,"I was in the mood for some Sci-Fi and saw this in the $3 Bin at Big Lots.Not a bad movie. Acting is decent, special effects are okay, and the plot, although predictable and very cliche is okay.basically, if you are in need of a sci-fi fix and are Jonesin pretty bad, then this will do in a pinch to get you through your rough patch until you can score some major sci-fi.To be honest, there are better movies out there of this type, this one is on the meh side, but it is watchable. Unlike some of the crap like Maverick films of Asylum, that crap is 100% unwatchable. At least with this, you will be entertained enough to sit through it."
4,Screamers: The Hunting,"When I sit down to watch a movie, I want to enjoy the film and not ponder if what is happening on the screen can really happen or if it'll tell me the meaning of life. It's escape and nothing more. With that being said, this film is damn good. I paid for a brand new copy for three bucks and I'd highly recomemnd it to sci-fi and horror fans. Alot of cool gore and the speical effects arent too bad. Highly entertaining and recommend watching it."
1,I don't believe it,"I recently bought this computer, the first time that I turn on the computer everything seems to be working just fine. The second time the computer put itself a BIOS password and now I cannot access my laptop, I researched about this and apparently this is a well know Toshiba issue and they don't do anything about it. I call costumer service and they told me that I should take my computer to the support company in my country and wait for their solution.THIS IS THE FIRST AND LAST TIME I BOUGHT A TOSHIBA. DELL is much better concerning new computers and costumer support."
1,AWFUL,The first notebook I received woul just shut down randomly. I returned and Amazon sent me another one. The second wouldn't even start up. They were both awful. I sent that one back also and opted for my money back.
5,Great laptop,la mejor portatil que he tenido... excelente recomendada... altamente resistente y muy rapida... su doble procesador la hace muy veloz y con capacidad para operar varios programas
1,3 New Toshiba.....,I have exchanged the Toshiba three times for a new Toshiba A215 each time due to the fact that at least daily on each one I have had the black screen of death occurs!!! I am extremely disappointed due to in the past Toshiba have had great inexpensive laptops. I am taking this worthless laptop back to Best Buy to find something else. Please don't buy this laptop as I have been through 3 in less than two weeks with the same reoccuring problem.
1,It is an ok machine. It has horrible defects.,"Like some other people, I recieved my computer and was extremely excited, because this time, I actually paid for mine instead of my parents. I turned it on, connected my external hard drive, and started to play music. BAM! Screen went black, music turned off, and the only way I could continue was to hit the power off button, then power it back up. This is completely unacceptable, and I have no earthly idea why Toshiba hasn't issued a recall. I wouldn't have felt compelled to write a review here on Amazon, but I took my computer back, and got another one. The same GODD*MN thing happened the day I got it! I am stunned, sitting here with a non-working computer, thanking the sweet lord for the fact that I kept my reciept. I would go with another computer, and dont even waste your time hoping to get one that works. Other than that, its an ok machine."
5,A Book to Own,"For the last two years and a half, I have tortured myself thinking that life sucks, that it isn't fair, and that there isn't any room for my crazy dreams and me in this world. At one point of my life I even got to believe that God hated me, because I was getting exactly the opposite of whatever I asked him. But after reading the book ATTILA, I realized that there are people who have suffered as much or even more than me, and that crying and weeping for the things that I have lost, is useless. I also discovered that the change that I suffered for leaving my country (Colombia) was nothing compared to what Attila (Peter Hargitai) had to go trough, and that, helped me to see life in a different way.In general terms, I loved the novel. It is brilliant, fun and easy to read, and I think that its content is very useful for anybody, like me, who is facing a new life in a different culture."
4,"Rage, rage against the dying light!","No matter what, Attila does not give up on what he wants, and that is the love of his life. The story is one to learn from. Not every writer is as honest as Peter Hargitai. If you seek the truth, you will find it with his novel. And, a love story to add never hurts.The main character Attila must deal with prejudice and death at a young age. This makes his journey through life more tedious than others. Yet through it all, he maintains sanity, and keeps his light bright. He challenges the norm, and fights for the woman he wants to spend the rest of his life with, whether or not no one approves.Motivation is an impact at the outcome of the novel. Carpe diem!"
4,Attila,"If you don't enjoy love stories don't be fooled by the title, it is more than a sad love story. It's the struggle of one man's life. Peter Hargitai does an incredible job at introducing the characters to the story as well as connecting the reader with the characters, making the reader love the character one minute and hate them the next. When reading ""Attila A Barbarian's Love Story"" the book becomes alive, making your own life come into perspective, not many authors can accomplish that. The book is exceptional. ""Attila A Barbarian's Love Story"" is an undying struggle to succeed at what others want you to fail. The story crawls under your skin and makes you question if what you want is really what you want and not what someone else wants."
3,A Hun With Feelings,"Attila, is a novel that not only Peter Hargitai could relate to but also an average audience. This barbarian love story travels through the recollections of a young boy's memories, escaping a revolution. As the novel progresses Attila becomes a normal person with everyday problems. The struggles with pre marital sex and trying to be faithful to God are of torment to him. Conflicts with his parents and his inner self are just a tiny snip of what young people go through. While reading this book the reader gets lost into Attila's head with the numerous amounts of flashbacks. Furthermore, the flashbacks within the novel create comfort between the reader and Attila."
5,Cool,"This book about a young boy named after the barbarian Attila was a great read, except for the beginning. A good portion of the beginning was interesting, that is if you enjoy reading about the Hungarian Revolution. But it's worth it, because once the book gets to its destination, America, I couldn't put it down.The problem with the beginning is that you don't know what's going on, your trying to memorize foreign names, and figure out where they are going and why. It's too much at once and once you get to America most of the first characters get pushed aside and the story focuses again on Attila. But the love story and how the couple went through their own personal struggles were inspiring to me and I bet to many others. It's always nice to read about what most of us go through every day through someone else's eyes."
3,Good quality-Beware of ordering size,"Make sure you order a couple sizes bigger than what your kid is. I did that mistake when I ordered the extra small for my four year old, who is in size 4t. The jacket was way too small for him. Other than that the quality of the jacket was pretty good."
2,interesting memoirs marred by tiresome editors,"A lot of the personal essays in here from women who were on the frontlines of the `70s feminism are interesting. But the editors are tiresome. The best thing that can be said is they didn't get out of their own way. Their ""dissection"" of people's personal lives is unnecessary--readers (especially the college-aged readers this book is undoubtedly intended for) are intelligent enough to form their own conclusions. And why do the editors focus solely on black and white relations--what about Latinos, Asians, Native Americans, and Arabs? And why not a single essay from a feminist with a disability?Also, the editors disbelief at one of the memoirists' moving story about marching in the civil rights movement with her father is especially offensive."
4,Unbelievable story -- Unfortunately true!,"After watching the movie Vendetta, I could not believe that it was based on an actual incident. I read the book, which is much better than the movie and so even more horrifying. Engrossing, detailed account of an incredibly savage, brutal incident of American bigotry. Excellent documentation."
4,Outrageous.,"Stepbrothers starring Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly is laugh-out-loud funny but kinda gross at the same time. Some of the jokes are so off-color but I couldn't help but enjoy this film from beginning to end. Some scenes I thought were a little too much but overall, Stepbrothers is so bad - it's good! Even Mary Steenburgen is delightful in this comedy, she hasn't been this likeable since Parenthood, who knew she had such strong comic timing? Stepbrothers is silly, painfully true, and completely childish but it works. Enjoy!"
1,Review of the first 1/2 hour,"I can really only comment on the first 1/2 hour of this DVD, since after 30 minutes of not laughing, the DVD was ejected from the player, never to be played again (at least by me.)As you might expect from the early retreat, I found the film to be a crude, pointless attempt at showing the worst possible behavior of two middle-aged losers who are forced to coexist when their parents marry. (Think Brady Bunch with 40 year old ""kids"" and lots of f-bombs thrown in.)The premise is funny, but that's as far as the humor goes in this movie. The sons act like they're 12, not 40. The combined IQ of the step-brothers is apparently about 90.If you feel that ""F - you"" / ""No, F - you"" is witty repartee, then go ahead and take a chance on this movie. Otherwise, I suggest you pass."
4,"Very funny, and I wasn't expecting it to be so good.","I'm not a Will Ferrell fan, as far as his movies go. I loved him on SNL, but he was always a bit too much in his movies, and I've seen a lot of them. I didn't want to see this one, but I was stuck when visiting friends, and they said they had a good movie to watch, and it turned out to be this one. Well, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. It was hilarious. Ferrell and Riley were a good combination, and it had a funny premise, two adult males who never grew up and still living at home acting like twelve year olds. Some of the stunts they pulled were exactly some of the ones my brother and his friends used to, so I guess I could really relate. A very stupidly humorous and entertaining film. I laughed like crazy!"
5,Buy this movie!,This movie is so funny!!! I would definetly recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor.
4,Step Brothers,"Funny movie. Adult humor. Pay attention to the R Rating. Filthy language, be wise who you let watch this movie."
5,Funny!,"If you like comedies, this is a movie for you! Bought this for my son for Christmas. He and his family found this movie hilarious! Received product within a week of ordering. Great service Amazon! Love ordering from you! Enjoy free shipping too!"
2,Predictable,"Initially I didn't want to see this film because I figured it would be just more of the same silly nonsense from Will Ferrel. After my roomate finally persuaded me to watch it because of its ""genious"" I watched it and was not surprised at all. It's just as stupid as I figured it would be and I just don't see what is so funny about 40 year old men acting like they are six. Much of the humor in the dialogue relies on what happens to be blurted out of Will Ferrel's mouth on his remarkable improv skills. It may be crazy and off the wall, but in the end, it's just not that funny."
1,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!,"Adult flim makers are the LOWEST OF THE LOW!The person who came with the unrated section is very EVIL!Flims like Step Brothers, are posion to our country!Wouldn't life be great, if unrated creators died!I wish companies would burn the unrated movies!"
4,Superchunk's zenith?,"How can they possibly do better than this? Great songs, great mix of sounds. It has the feel of an unintended classic. But can they possibly squeeze anything else from the Superchunk musical sponge? Unfortunately, their next album, ""Here's To Shutting Up"", shows signs of going through the motions,so it should remain their last album, unless they can go out with a bang, not a whimper. ""Come Pick Me Up"" is the kind of album you listen to from beginning to end while painting, or building something. Most people I know don't know why they like this, they just do."
3,This is not up to her live performance standards,"I wanted to love this album. Heard Jacqui live in San Francisco at outdoor festival and was just knocked out by her phrasing and timing. She seems to have a great musician's feel, which is somewhat rare among some of the ""chanteusse"" like singers she is sometimes compared to. But this recording is just flat; it has little spark, although it is competent. Just competent, not interesting. Not sure where to find the best of Jacqui, since most of the reviews I've seen say this is the best of her studio efforts. I played it a few times and forgot about it. Just not an interesting effort."
3,Not exactly a conventional whodunit,"The ""Weeping Buddha"" is many things. The author evidently has a lot of experience with the New York City performing arts crowd of the 1980s, with Suffolk County and the impact of development on the long-time residents and with Buddhism. The author has also evidently done a lot of research regarding forensic procedures and apparently based her main characters on two very interesting detectives on Long Island. Finally, the author appears to be using the book as a tool to exorcise an old ghost in her life, the book flashed back to a diesappearance during a New Year's party in the `80s.But the ingredients do not come together to make up a readable story. A reader who likes the modern mystery as done by Sue Grafton, Peretsky, Linda Barnes, one that traces its lineage back to Chandler and Hammett, might want to skip this book. A reader who does have some interest in the same areas that the author does might want to read it for those ingredients."
1,This might have worked as an Amateur mystery....,"...but it isn't - it is a police procedural filled with forensics and homicide detectives who totally fail to act the part - ignoring totally obvious clues - the whole thing rests on very amateurish improbabilities and errors. As for the Zen milieu, it really didn't add up to much for me - you get more from Janwillen Van de Wetering's stuff. Not deep, and not well constructed."
2,Not the book for finding prices of cans or trays,"Book has an extremely limited amount of content. Only the rarest trays are and signs are listed with prices. If your looking for prices for most of the trays you see this is not the book for you, also not a beer can price guide at all. If your expecting to look up Kruger, Ballentine, etc. companys trays to find prices, your not going to find it here."
4,Excellent but ...,"I've been using this book for years and have always found it readable, scholarly, impartial (as among the different branches of Judaism), and comprehensive. Although that remains my opinion, I was recently shocked to discover a significant error--the article on Rabbi Eliezer (p. 143) tells the famous and philosophically fascinating Talmudic story of Rabbi Eliezer's dispute with an authoritative group of colleagues over a point of law. Jacobs says that ""Rabbi Eliezer held fast to his opinion even against ... a voice that came from heaven."" In fact, the original Talmudic story (found at Bava Metzia 59b) recounts that the heaveny voice (G-d) was invoked by Rabbi Eliezer and said to the other rabbis (from the Steinsaltz translation) 'Why are you [disputing] with Rabbi Eliezer, for the [law] is in accordance with him everywhere?"" Notwithstanding this error, the only one I have come across in many hours with this book, I heartily recommend it."
5,Very impressive work,This is an amazingly readable work.A serious aid in my education about the jewish religion.Jack Millman
4,A blessed and enjoyable journey. . . . .,"The women of my church are using Donna's book for a retreat during the fall. As they prepare, the 5 presenters are completing the 10-week journey. Each woman will address one of the Five Requirements for Becoming A Vessel God Can Use. As the coordinator of the retreat, I am also completing this journey. We are being blessed tremendously and it is an enjoyable journey. I complete several lessons each day. I like it because it is concise yet so challenging that the time required to complete is easily spent. I thank God for using Donna as a vessel of ministry to Christian women."
1,THE CASTING DIRECTOR SHOULD BE FIRED!!!!!!!!!,THIS WOULD NOT BE A BAD PLAY AT ALL BUT THERESE ONE MAJOR FLAW!!!!MOST OF THE ACTORS CANT SING!!!!I WASNT IMPRESSED WITH JESUS SINGING VOICE AND SOME OF THE OTTHER ACTORS THERE VOICES ARE JUST PLAIN HORRIBALE!!!!I WOULD THINK BEING ABLE TO SING WOULD BE THE MAIN REQIREMENT TO GET A PART IN THIS PLAY WAS THE CASTING DIRECTOR DRUNK!!!!
5,Amazing,This is one DVD/video you can't miss! Glenn Carter are GREAT! He's Jesus in this show and there's no doubt about that fact.Jerome Pradon as Judas are fantastic and Renee Castle's Mary shines. This CD and video can't be missed! Carter and Pradon arts so fantasticly I'll have given them an Oscar if I could *G*Must buy this CD and the video/DVD now!
1,Should be a 0,"I was so excited when I heard of the revival, but then I had the misfortune of watching this. My issues center around two major problems. First is that Carter simply does not have the proper voice range to hit the high notes. Second is that the portrayal of Judas is very traditional and conservative. The original concept was one which presented the life of Christ through the eyes of Judas. The audience should identify with Judas and not hate him. In this version Judas is the typical evangelical version that you expect to see at a Christmas or Easter play."
2,Oh dear...well not a total disaster,"This is actually a fairly bloodless, passionless retelling of JCS. The singing in general leaves much to be desired. The directing is fairly bland and unimaginative. To be honest just decorating a set and costuming it in a new and different way does not a directorial vision make. Acting is generally weak and the choreography is ridiculous.Skip this and see Norman Jewison's version instead."
3,JC Superstar with a few twists,"I really like JC Superstar the movie with Ted Neeley released in '73.This version of Supertar as a filmed play was very interesting to watch. There are some parts that I hated, other parts that I really liked. For true JC Superstar fans you really should add this to your collection"
3,"Nice to see, but they could have used more talent","It's nice to have a Dolby 5.1 soundtrack, and the cinematography and visual aspects of the sets and actors is good overall, but almost all of the performers are pretty weak in either the ability or motivation to vocalize their parts well. It's worth buying if you're a JCS fan, but if you don't have a JCS DVD/tape yet I'd find a community theater playing it and go see it in person. The little group I saw in Buffalo a few years back had more singing talent than the people in this production. The older DVD isn't bad either, I'd rank it slightly above this one overall."
1,The Gospel is no Longer according to Judas,"... I had great hopes for this production. I saw it on Broadway, and was disappointed in the loss of Gospel of Judas... Hoping the DVD would be more noteworthy, I purchased for my collection - it retained the dullness that was not part of the, in my opinion, original intent of Lloyd/Rice. rather than completing Judas' story (his self-murder) the story ends simply with the crucifixion. A shame and travesty. Hey, Sir Andrew: Why the re-write?"
2,Judas steals the show,"While nowhere near the singer that portrayed Christ, Judas by far stole the show with his emotional acting and lines. In fact if they hadn't been at the last supper and sang the Apostle song you can barely pick out Judas's 11 companions from the mob.Chaias, Pilate, and Herod sing in a difficult manner to follow; despite this Pilate manages one of the better performances of the show when he asks why Christ must die. Herod simply comes off annoying.Magdalene sings the nice 'I Don't Know How to Love Him' number and Christ's moment of doubt is very moving. There are a few other good moments through the show but overall I found it disappointing."
3,OK For Die-Hard Fans; Others Should Try the 1973 Version,"This production is inferior to the 1973 movie in almost every way. Glenn Carter's portrayal of Jesus is listless...the one exception being the 39 Lashes scene....where no singing is required. Jerome Pradon, while fairly capable, lacks the extra oomph required to do justice to his character. Pilate (Fred Johanson) deserves jail time for his criminal overacting. Mary does a good job with her part, as does Simon Zealotes as Peter. Finally, let me say that I found myself drifting off to sleep a couple of times....that never happens during the 1973 version!"
5,A great book on modern Mexican art.,"I was looking for a book on Mexican art of the 20th century. This books meets and exceeds all my expectations! It has beautiful illustrations of all the masterpieces of the Mexican artists, their biographies, and just provides a great review of the bext Mexican painters.And this book is big size-wise."
3,Average surfing movie with less known surfers...,"This is an average surf movie.The strength of this movie is that it has some relatively unknown surfers riding longboards and shortboards in some exotic locations. Bruce Irons is probably the best know surfer in it.The music is just okay.The movie is pretty short at around 35 minutes.If you like shortboarding, then get a different movie like Melali sessions or One California Day.If you want a story, watch Single Fin Yellow instead."
3,"General Photography book, not much else","I think the book's title is a bit misleading in that the handbook really doesn't tell you how to get the most out of your camera. I bought the book hoping to learn something new, but the focus is more about general concepts, such as how to buy a camera, basic shooting techniques, etc. I read the book in a day because I already knew what was in the book -- I gave this three stars because it's a good book for a beginner, but not for intermediate and above users."
2,Mind Boggling Book,"This was the third blackjack book I've read, after KO Blackjack and The World's Greatest Blackjack Book. I read that Don Slessinger is the greatest auhtority in the world on blackjack. Maybe he is, maybe he isn't. This book was incoherent. I found World's Greatest Blackjack Book much better and KO Blackjack was also better. I learned a few things from this book but not enough for [the price]!"
1,Ridiculous Overkill,"Blackjack is not that hard to play. But Schlessinger makes it sound as if we're dealing with intricate brain surgery. We aren't. If you want to know the ""secret formula"" of professionals you might consider this. If you play games with deep penetration, count cards in these games, structure your betting to get to double the number of decks you are playing against when the count is positive, and get that money out there in high counts, you will win. It is that simple. Schlessinger's book is truly ludicrous in its intricacies. His math isn't wrong, it just isn't necessary to play winning blackjack. If you are looking for good blackjack books to give you a handle on this game, look elsewhere."
5,this book rules,"Sparling is some kind of genius. His work is transcendent, opaque, difficult and wonderful. His reinvention of prose is magical to witness. This book got a great review in the Toronto Star, but the US-based Amazon bookstore doesn't seem to have too many reviews from outside good old America. Buy Sparling, buy Canadian!"
5,Farm Team,"A young boy starts a team. It all starts when a dealer sells his mom a bad car and his dad gets mad. The father goes to jail, so the mom works in towm and the son takes care the farm.They start a team on the farm. WANT TO READ MORE???? Read farm team."
5,A Fun read,"This book was really fun. It's very lighthearted, but at the same time keeps you into it. I thought this book was cute and funny."
5,Great book to escape with,"""Elyza"" was a great story to read if you just want to immerse yourself in a different time and place. A fun love story without being overly sappy."
2,"This Guy Can Play, But...","I just can't get to like this one. Gary can really play the sax and flute well and the sound quality on this cd is excellent, but most of the songs just don't do anything for me. The title cut opens up the cd with Gary playing the flute and it starts out excellent. Then he goes and messes it up by be-bopping to his flute. I hate when musicians do that. You can't sound any better than your instrument, so just keep your mouth shut! The second track ""When Love Appears"" is beautiful and is the only one I really enjoy off this cd. Everyone's tastes are different. This cd wasn't for me. If you're going to buy this one make sure you listen to it first."
5,His Ways,Excellent!! I know that All those things were made by him. I have no doubt God is always God and he do the way he want and use what he want to use. Aleluya!
1,Painful Sound - Waste of Money,"This set may be a pretty cheap bargain but it's not even worth the 23 dollars. The sound is attrociously bad, you will get nothing but an ear ache from listening to two cd's worth of this garbage. If you want to get a good performance all around (Not just from the tenor and soprano) get the Corelli-Tebaldi version, or the Domingo studio recordings. Trust me, there are so many beautiful arias and moments in this opera, this crap recording does not do any of them justice."
1,Myth-ed the Mark,Robert Asprin tampered with a winning formula and it shows. Not only has Skeeve changed from the lovable dolt we knew him as but he's changed for the worst. There's a lot more contemplation in this book (who needs that in a lighthearted sci fi?) and a corresponding lack of action. What most endeared readers to the Myth series were the comical complications that Skeeve would get himself into. This book is a disappointment. Stick with the previous ones and save yourselves a letdown.
4,Sweet Mythteries,"Sweet Mythteries of Life was very typical of Robert Asprin. His humorous writing is always appreciated by me. Fantasy all the way. This book showed Skeeve, the main character, growing up and his ""love life"", etc. Definitely interesting and worth reading, but bother to read the other ""myth"" books first. They are all very good. Easy read, rather humorous."
2,I was disapointed about this book,"I think that this book takes away from the other MYTH books. It was more of a love story than an acton book. It had almost no point to it because Skeeve never decided who he was in love with. And Gleep said Skeeve as soon as it got shot with an arrow, why couldn't he talkin any of the other books. So if you like the MYTH series skip this book."
4,Not _THAT_ bad!,"Hey! this book wasn't that bad! Sure it kinda read like a soap opera... but haven't you read the other books? They're all like that! This book is merely everything coming to a head!I enjoyed it!True, don't start with this one... but you never start with the last books in a series, anyway. duh.SO. this book was good, but only if you want to know what is going on to the people you have fallen in love with throughout the series. If you want slapstick? try the stooges. The humour is there, but this book is pure continuity.BTW:I personally am voting for the trollop over the moll! (Though I like Bunny!) and WHAT'S HAPPENED TO GLEEP?!?!?!"
1,Are there any 1/2 stars?,Marschark a genius? I think not. His research is lacking greatly and his opinion that deaf children cannot read as well as hearing children is ludicrous. This 'know it all' professor is not perspicacious enough to understand the real workings of the deaf child's mind and all they actually do understand.My recommendation is to look elsewhere if you want someone who is knowledgable in the area of deaf studies.
4,Really a 4++!,"Rick Steves does it again. Great recommendations. The only quibble (why not a 5) is that Rick is so selective that he does not include places, such as Tomar, that may be off the beaten path but really do deserve a mention, if not a strong encouragement to visit. If you buy this book, or even if you don't, look at his website where there are updates and a ""chat room"" that help you plan a visit."
4,Nice rebound from Binaural,"I rank this album up there with Vitalogy and Yield, PJs best. I've been a fan from the beginning and find that Vs. and Ten, which are great alubms for their time, sound too much like a product of a young band, which in fact they were at the time (I only mention this because so many reviewers have a tough time facing that those albums are not the bands top work. Face it, kids - life does go on).Upon 1st listen, I was about half way through Riot Act when I thought that I was yet to hear a unintersting song (not the case on their last album - Binaural). This is a complete album. I do not find myself skipping past any songs. Nice progression boys. I'm looking forward to the next one."
1,Let's Be Honest,"I am a huge fan of Pearl Jam but this album sucks. What happened to the riffs, the energy, the passion and the melody? What happened to everything we love about Pearl Jam. It is not a sell out to actually write songs that people will like. These songs are listless, unoriginal and meandering. No structure or substance. Even through their more experimental phase during No Code they created ""Hail Hail"" and ""Smile"". What a huge disappointment this is! Pearl Jam fans need to stop being blind fanatics. They have done some amazing work but this is not up to snuff. Let's be intellectually honest with ourselves."
4,Hours of listening enjoyment,"Riot Act Rocks... plain and simple... Song after song of melodic innovative tunes that have become a staple of Pearl Jam's over the past decade or so... Riot act delivers... One thing I've always admired about the band is their ability to reinvent their sound succesfully each and every time... with so may other bands failing to do so.... (most even) but this album tends to sound a little simillar to Binaural in some aspects. Not to say it isn't an excellent cd, and well worth the price to any pearl jam fan, and even those who just like a few PJ songs, as this album has many radio worthy selections. Even bushleager which is basically a politcal rant against George W, set to a chorous, is catchy after a couple listens...Definate recomendation..."
1,Awful,"The best band of the 90's really hit rock-bottom in the 2000's,and Riot Act is Pearl Jam's worst.Here are some reasons why I hated Riot Act:1.The Musicwhat happened to all thous great riffs on past albums?The greatchoruses?Lot of time there is no melodies.2.Vedder's vocals.what happened to the emotion in his voice?He sounds tired and bored.3.The Lyrics.Vedder's lyrics have become extremely hit and miss lines from poems that just sound like toss off lines and often contradict one another.Also-the whole band writing lyrics makes this album lack one voice even more.4.The ProductionThe ""Live"" sound just sounds really sloppy"
4,Get This CD PJ is not Dead,"Im a huge pj fan but it took me awhile to get riot act because i didnt think it would be that great boy was i wrong. this cd is just amazing i love listening to it. PJ has become a very uniqe band this cd is a completion of binaural. meaning some parts of it is a better binaural. matt writes more in this as well and of course there is BOOM. but the reason you should get this album is you will not find any other band like PJ. this is a one of a kind band right now. ""you are' for example . this type of song will not be played anywhere. some of my favorites include ""1/2 full"" and ""cropduster"". plus Ghost is an awesome track"
5,The gossip is true! Pearl Jam are back to the fore!,"I purchased this album after hearing 'I am mine' and 'love boat captain' endlessly on the radio. I bought it and was extremly impressed. No filler here, just good ol' rock n' roll. Finally (after many years) it seems Pearl Jam are going to get the credit they deserve with both airplay and a ~GREAT~ album."
1,PJ's weakest album EVER!,"I'm shocked by all of their positive reviews for this CD. Let me say that I am a big PJ fan, but this album is severely disappointing. There's a handful of OK tracks, but there's not even one great song or anything that stacks up to the quality of their older material. This is by far the weakest album of their career. Overall the album sounds uninspired, bland and flat out boring. Vedder's vocals even sound bored. The main problem is PJ just don't seem to be able to write good hooks anymore. It sounds like all these songs were written and recorded in one day. Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect for Pearl Jam and they are still a great live band. I have always been a supporter of their music, but ""Riot Act"" actually makes me think twice about ever shelling out money again for one of their albums..."
4,"Good, But Not Great",I picked this CD up a few months after hearing I Am Mine non-stop on the radio. I must admit it's not the best work they've done. Don't get me wrong I'm not one of those 'grungy I love Ten & Vs. Only' fans. In fact No Code and Yield are my favorite Pearl Jam albums but this one just didn't cut it for me. I can't explain why or how it just didn't have the same feel. But who knows give it time and it might be my favorite. It did take No Code 3 years to rise to the top of my list.
4,Different...but in a good way,"Ive been a PJ fan for years and i must say, this album is nothing like their previous work. Over the years PJ has amde the transition from the loud grunge band that it started as to more deep and circumspect lyrics. Although this album lacks impact songs like ""Jeremy"" and ""Betterman"", it still has potential to turn some heads with songs like ""All or None"" (more stereotypical PJ) and ""Thumbing My Way"", which sounds more like...well it doesnt sound like PJ thats for sure.either way this is still a great album which is definatly worth purchasing."
5,Fantastic Book!,"Wow, excellent history of the Colt, the pictures are just works of art as much as the Colts depicted in them. A must for the Colt enthusiast."
3,Layman Introduction to SUPPRESSORS...,"This is a very dated book on the evolution, history, production and employment of sound suppressors (AKA Silencers). This book presents some pretty interesting historical facts but is light on foot noting sources. So by no means is this an academic text, however this does not distract from it being a fun open minded read, were I am sure one will find some ""gold nuggets"" of information. Although if you are looking for something a little more academic and professional I would jump on the two volume set by Paulson; ""Silencer: History and Performance, Volume 1: Sporting and Tactical Silencers"" and ""Silencer History and Performance, Volume 2: CQB, Assualt Rifles and Sniper Technology."""
5,"Learn Your Bones First, Then The Foresics.",The book is very practical and straight forward while giving enough information to continue your reading.
