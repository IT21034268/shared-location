3,"Not bad, but Regardie's better","Anything by Israel Regardie, Paulo Coelho, or Dion Fortune is more thorough and provides more guidance and context. Kraid doesn't provide dilettantes and neophytes enough understanding what they're getting into.Ceremonial Magick is both the heart of a truly universal philosophy and a practical system of spiritual enlightenment. To focus on manipulation of the everyday world is Self-defeating. By all means in your power, do you avoid such aims. Truly, be careful what you wish for."
5,Can I give it more than 5?,"What can I say? If you are looking for black magic spells to cast on your ex-lover, this isn't the best book for that, but good for nearly every other aspect of magick. This book covers such a range of topics, it gives rituals which improve your life bringing you closer to the divine, it shows you the true meaning of magic, it covers the Kabbalah, astral projection, tarot, dreams, the list is endless. This is definately the best book I have ever found on magick, and I've lost count of the number of times I've read it despite its many pages. If you really want to become a great magician and improve your life with Kraig's concise, well laid out and easy to understand book, then my suggestion is to buy this book. Well worth the money!"
5,Foundations of Magick,"If you're new to the concept of Ceremonial magick, this is a good book. HOwever if you're looking for low magick, there's plenty of books out there. The market is actually saturated with low magick 101 books. IT's actually kind of sickening.So to come across a primer in basic magick without any kind of bla bla bla theology crud behind it like Crowley and the others. Sure he doesn't delve very deep into the reasons for why you use said rituals, ANother fault I have with the modern Pagan Community at large. I don't blame him though as you actually do have to wade through the principles and other guidelines that Crowley ad Reguardie and all of them go into in other books. So this is more like supplimental reading. Especially if you want to pratice magick and not just read about it."
3,Not a bad purchase if you like the song,"This CD single gives you the original English version of this song, the original Spanish version, and the English video. The video is very good quality. I have the complete Spanish CD (Mi Reflejo), and it includes the Spanish version of this song's video as well as the Spanish version of the Genie In A Bottle video. I don't have the English CD. If it also has the video on it, then you might want to just buy that unless you want this song in both languages."
1,This is America Christina... Hello? English!,It is bad enough having to hear the song on the radio in english. But then she has to sing it is another language when half the country dosn't even know what she is sayin'! Poor effort on her part! Horrible song!
5,This book is about books - and the love of life.,"This marvelous book is about books, by a man who loved life. It focuses on books and learning. It is not a mere autobiography, but details a lifetime of learning- learning acquired from direct experience, all the while augmented by voracious reading. Someone looking for the ordinary ""first I did this and then I did that"" will be disappointed. Anyone interested in learning about books and how they enriched an incomparable life will be fascinated."
3,Mr. Roberts Class,"This Book was not my favorite book i have ever read, but it did have some parts that really pulled me in like the part at the mine and then going through the dessert. What i did not like about this book was when louie wouled talk about the books that he read because i had no clue what those books were or who the authers were. I really liked the boxing parts of the book were louie would talk about his boxing and his carer."
5,Burton is great,"I loved the book: it reads like a novel and one has to remind oneself that it is a true story. It quotes extensively from Burton's notebooks and often he seems to be a better writer than Bragg. Burton emerges as a gifted, intelligent and sensitive person torn by inner conflicts - the side of him few people knew. At the same time the book has all: the glamour, the scandals, the love story etc. After reading it I rushed to buy all Burton's videos available here."
4,"A small disappointment, nevertheless a must for Ozu fans","Yasujiro Ozu is unarguably one of the greatest directors of this world. This is a late Ozu piece, and it is somewhat disappointing. A story of a travelling company theater actor who returns to a village where he has left behind an illegitimate son, is the central theme in this piece. Although superbly acted, and beautifully shot, the direction (surprisingly), with the editing takes a few stumbles, and the end product is somewhat half-baked, and does not stir you as much as the classic Ozu pieces. I am glad that Ozu left us with the beautiful ""Autumn Afternoon"", made 3 years after this film, a dazzling return to form, and a sublime swan song. Nevertheless, for all you die-hard Ozu fans, ""Floating Weeds"" will be a welcome addition to your collection."
1,Don't be fulled by the looks,This item was very different from the picture. It was a cheep material like a paper. I should've purchased just simple white plastic one. Now I can't return this because it's not worth spending shipping cost.
5,AN EXCELLENT READ,"I've always been a fan of Johnny Cash and his music. After seeing ""I Walk The Line"" with Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix, a real desire to ""hear"" from John himself came over me. I absolutely loved the movie but found to my surprise that no mention of Ray Cash (Johnny's father) mistreating his son was found in the book. And actually, there were only good things said about Ray.John told with great clarity of the horror drug addiction brings on a person. It was so sad to read his words about the pain of withdrawal but how his life changed when he truly began living the Christian life, along with the help of June Carter and her family.I heartily recommend this book to one and all."
5,K&N,Increased my horse power in my 300zx significantly! Definitely buy again. Product is great. Also would like some decals if you have any?
5,Awesome little container,My son has food allergies and I'm constantly having to bring him a single cupcake to parties. This container is perfect for just that. It has six plastic prongs on the inside to keep it from moving around and holds a standard sized cupcake. It's quite a conversation piece too! Glad I found this.
5,Puzo's Best,"The Fortunate Pilgrim is beautifully written. It is the story of a immigrant woman who struggled to raise a family here in America early in the 20th Century. Modeled on his own mother, Lucia is a formidable force that noone triffles with , let alone ignores. Puzo referred to this novel as his favorite. It certainly is mine. I ordered it from Amazon after hearing a review on NPR."
1,Too Small To Fit Queen Sized Airbed,Does not fit the queen size air mattress as it was advertised to do. A waste of my money! Too bad. The concept was good.
3,Size was not as expected,"I have 2 Queen size airbeds and this cover did not fit either of them. One corner would not reach and it barely covered the two of us. The quality is good and comfy, but I wish it would fit properly. Also, there is no way to fit it back in the bag it originally came in. I tried rolling it as tightly as I could and there is no way to fit it back in the bag."
5,LOTEC have a lot to offer,"The local radio station put on a song one morning and I fell in love with the melodicism--that song was LOTEC's 'Mech Man.' This great band out of Chicago has a lot to offer. I once compared them to Cheap Trick with a heavier edge. All the songs are great, Dan Farelli's voice is melodic but scratchy. The songs have great lyrics, my favourites being 'Mech Man,' 'Idiot,' and 'Land of the El Caminos.' In truth, I would compare them to a young Helmet, metal too rooted in pop to escape. It's a beautiful mix. Very exciting and invigorating, and so, I gave it five stars."
1,Broke the first time,"I bought this unit and the adaptor broke the first time I tried using it. I contacted Kwikset twice but have received no response. I'm sorry I bought it, but at over $200 I assumed I'd be buying something substantial, especially with the Kwikset brand name. I wouldn't recommend this or, based on the non response from Kwikset, any other dealings with this company."
5,KMK,"The KMK have done it once again, with their 3rd hit album! They even have a song with my other fav. band the ICP! This CD is always in the CD player, truthfully it never leaves it! The song they have out on MTV and stuff Peace Not Greed is great! The guest appearance from that guy.. i don't know who he is, but is cool. My fav. song is the one that goes ""sittin' on my front porch sippin' on my pipe"" that one is the s**t!"
4,Psychedelic Punk-Hop,"Damn - theres a handfull of albums that I've come across in my life that completely astounded me and confused me well. When I first heard this cd, I couldn't really understand how sick it was. Sound and energy I had never heard before. Its that kind of feeling that wishes you had made it, or could have been a part of it. This album is very well produced, some may say too electronical, but I like progressive studio tricks. The energy is great and doesn't sound bland or soulless, like some overproduced electronic tracks. I do get tired of the same subject matter (weed), but i get passed it, paying more attention to style and delivery and blend. All the tracks don't receive a 10, but at least 12 do. I get excited when there are at least 3 or 4 great tracks on an album, but this one has 12. I could see hip-hop and electronic melodic ambient music merging real well in the mainstream. Hats off to this cd."
5,Brand New Heavies,"What can I say about one of the greatest funk bands known to man? BNH is pure FUNK to the core and inner most soul. Gravy-ness, nothing but pure gravy. Just put the music on and let it go. I love the songs and N'Dea Davenport is just perfect with them. The songs are way bomb, the bass lines are hotness and that makes for a great sound and an awesome band. I have never had the pleasure of hearing them live and if I had one regret in life that would be the one. Awesome band. Pure gravy-ness."
1,ummm....,"ok i can understand the mental anguish from having such a painful childhood and being molested by your own father....But hey I was molested by my grandfather from birth to age 14 and I never saw any stinking spaceship!Yes I can joke about it now, and still no spaceship. Should I feel cheated? LOL"
3,I THINK I'VE SEEN THIS PLOT BEFORE,"I'm cerain this plot has been used multiple times in women's fiction - a female ancestor ""speaks"" to a modern woman via her diary.I can't say it was easy to warm up to any of the main characters because they were all such a bunch of pills. Everyone was settling for less than what they really wanted. When the women spoke up for themselves, the milquetoast men suddenly got nasty. They all spent way too much time tiptoeing around each other in unhappy lives.At the end there was a sort-of tying up of the loose ends and love-conquers-all, which I guess was to be expected given the genre. Some good points were made about the day-to-dayness of marriage and relationships, but overall I thought this book was kind of a bore."
5,sgt.pepper's lonely hearts club band movie dvd,it was great movie ! so happy that dvd movie has closed captioned on it. i am big die hard fan of Bee Gees since 1970's . loved to watch that dvd movie with closed captioned !!!
1,Big Time BAD!!!,I thought that the movie was one of the biggest stinkers in the history of the planet... I hate Peter Frampton and Barry Gibb... They both come off as a bunch of pritty boys! Robin Gibb as playing the part of a wimp! He had to have Barry punch Alice Cooper in the face to save him from being strangled to death. the feast sequence had a drug influence feel to it... I would NEVER show this to my family... The only good thing about the soundtrack was Robin Gibb's verson of Oh Darling... Let's Not forget Get Back By Billy Preston... Otherwise the film is a complete waste of time and money... Bee Gees and Frampton RUINED the Beatles music... They ALL need acting lessons.. Poor George Burns He was also the only thing worth watching...I hope that it is never released to DVD...
3,Not the best/not the worst...,"I saw this movie when it came out & at the time I thought it was pretty funny. It seemed to me to be more of a spoof on musicals & as such it worked. The two things that really stuck in my memory were Earth, Wind & Fire's performance of ""Got to get you into my life"" & Aerosmith's killer version of ""Come Together"". Fast forward years later & my 16 (at the time) year old daughter is not only a Beatles fan but also loves Aerosmith. And she likes Peter Frampton too. You know I had to get this! We both agreed that the movie is corny & dated but still funny. We also agreed that just for those two performances this is worth it. We saw Aerosmith last year & they ROCKED ""Come Together"" live!! So it's not the best movie I ever saw but it's also not the worst. And any movie that a mom & daughter can actually agree on is OK in my book."
1,Can't Get You Out of my Head,"I loved this movie! I was not born during the Beettles time, I love musicals and this one blow my mind. I have been looking for this movie for over a year. I now have a daughter that is also into musicals and i wanted her to view this one and be able to appreiciate it as I and my sisters have."
5,Simply delightful!,"Yes, I had seen this film before but not for many years. I am happy to report that it's as wonderful as I remembered!"
1,"Quality, VERY BAD!! Movie, Fantastic!","Movie = 5 starsDVD = ZERO stars!This has been one of my favorite movies since it was released. I know it's silly, but it's still great. After watching it a few times online I decided it was time to buy a copy for myself.*** The quality of the DVD is HORRIBLE!*** Even the static pictures are blurry. This is not just because it's an older movie (shows perfectly online through a different streaming service).Very unfortunate as I would love to have my own copy. I do NOT recommend purchasing this version of the DVD."
1,No Pep,"Entertainment industry impresario Robert Stigwood had an incredible winning formula for merging music with film in Saturday Night Fever and Grease. But there was also this movie that delivered a crippling financial blow to his international RSO empire.The 1978 musical starred a pair of Billboard chart monsters - Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees - in a thin story line that ties into the classic album of the same name by the Beatles. The last scene - ""Our Guests at Heartland"" - is the most fun, as it is a fitting tribute to the classic album cover and features an incredible cast that includes Tina Turner, George Harrison, Donovan, Linda McCartney and Heart.But to get to that point means to view director Michael Schultz pouring on the glitz, though nothing can ultimtately save the exploits of Frampton (Billy Shears) and the Gibb brothers from the incredibly weak script that centers on keeping the musical magic going in Heartland, U.S.A."
5,"I KNOW, IT HAD TERRIBLE REVIEWS ...","MAYBE I JUST LOVE THE MUSIC? IT'S SUCH A GREAT TIME CAPSULE THO & MAKES ME REMEMBER THE LATE 70's EVEN BETTER, LOL. IF YOU LIKE THE BEATLES ALBUM, YOU HAVE TO LIKE THIS MOVIE :D"
2,Some things should just live in the land of nostalgia. This is one.,"I was about 10 years old when this album came out and I thought it was great at the time. I recently bought it so I could take a trip down memory lane and it was really a lot better in my memories than it is in reality. There's not a lot of creativity to his songs. He does have a unique voice, though. There are a couple of songs I guess I will probably listen to now and again for nostalgic reasons, i.e. Funky Cold Medina and Wild Thing, but overall, meh."
5,Great guidebook for active traveller,"This is one of the best guidebooks I have ever had! The author's really seemed to take the time and effort to explore Kauai and learn of its best secrets. It is great for active travellers. The book is extremely well organized, and everything is easy to find. The maps are super. Milepost markings on the map make it extremely useful for finding those small roads on the island that lead to a hiking trail or a small unknown beach. And the hiking maps and descriptions are enough to make this book the only guide you really need. I didn't need to buy any other maps. The guide was fairly accurate (including don't hike a certain trail when its muddy - I wish I listened!) and also contained great information on restaurants and hotels. Highly recommended!"
2,bottom of barrel,Because this book was one of those featured by Amazon we bought it along with the Revealed for Maui. Both were bitter disappointments mostly because the text is mostly opinion and orientating to where you are when you're reading it is very confusing. The authors are very amusing with opinions about this and that but all that falls short when you're wanting to find out where to go. We wasted alot of time.I gave it two stars because my children enjoyed the photos.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I wish I would have read the reviews beyond the first page before I bought this doll. It's cute and has a great concept. I bought it for my daughter last Christmas. It worked for about one week and then the hair would not grow, the want would not work, it kept making this griding noise. All in all it was a waste of money."
4,"Cute, fun and durable!","My daughter received this for her 2nd birthday.She loved the doll, and she has never really been a Dora FANATIC. SO it is not just for the fans.the hair growing has always worked well, and is simple.I love how you dont NEED the wand to make her work, just in case it is ever lost or miplaced.She is incredibly durable and made well. She will ALWAYS be able to stand up and not easily tip over like other dolls."
1,ok,I use it to clip some of my kitten hair near the tail area. It did not cut so well even he has short hair. I have to go ove the same spot a few times before it would cut to shorter lenght. I don't recommend it.
1,Disappointing and Misleading,"When I bought this product, prices on Amazon.com ranged from about $9.00 to $25.00. Now, I see it's down as low as $4.75. Regardless, I found it no bargain at any price. While it's billed as a trimmer for both nose and ears, the instructions say to use for nose only. Folks -- when you get older, you need to trim your ears! It's more flimsy than other Panasonic products I've used in the past and difficult to clean. What can I say -- ""No nose is good nose?"""
3,Good for beginners,"A good choice for beginning violinists. The bow is of good quality for a student's violin, though the strings are lacking. The violin itself arrived in a timely manner; however, upon taking a good look at the violin, I noticed that one of the pegs was very loose and made it impossible to tune the D-string. The bridge is also of lackluster quality. The wood used was taken from the outer, younger part of the tree, which means that it is very soft and that the vibration of the strings would wear it away very fast. I have replaced the strings and bridge and gotten the D-peg fixed.If you are looking for a decent learner's violin, this is a good buy. The case is of good quality (as is the bow). As you progress, you will need to invest in a higher-quality instrument. Advice to buyers of this violin - replace the strings and the bridge."
1,NOT The same as the original,I expected the same fragrance as the original Charlie White. This is not! The perfume STINKS and I cannot even wear it. I'll end up throwing the bottle away as I've thrown out the packing slip and can't return it.
1,Oh! Look at Poor Me!,"I find Fellows book about his time in a Bangkok prison to be a self-serving piece of self-pity!There was no ""storyline"" as such, just endless pages of OH! LOOK AT POOR ME! LOOK HOW BADLY TREATED I AM!Give me a break! If this type of tripe can make a buck I should write one myself to get some folding money for smokes and beer.This is for all the Warren Fellows ""writers"" of the world......PSFFFSSSFT!!! Wasted my time!"
4,Great for beginners :),I am a beginner to c++. I am currently inroled in a c++ class in college and I read this book along with the course book. It's a great help. When reading the book I can now understand what the teacher is talking about in lecture. It's also nice to be able to help others in lab. Most of the programs in the book are games. This is nice for someone who want to get into the game industry(like me). This is a nice book for a beginner.
5,classic,"After all these years, this film is still such great entertainment. These CD's are of good quality. We enjoy Julie Andrews, too.!"
1,Disappointing customer service,"I bought this toothbrush and the battery ""died"" within the warranty period. I took it to the designated repair facility where the toothbrush sat for FIVE WEEKS waiting for repair. After calling Braun, I was told that the toothbrush battery replacement must be ""stuck"" in U.S. Customs. It was very frustrating to get the ""run around"" from Braun. After calling, Braun agreed to send me a refund by check, which arrived yesterday. Of course, the cost of the toothbrush in the meantime has increased. I believe the product is a good product, however, consider yourself warned in case your battery dies, too."
4,great brush,"Although it costs more and I don't think most people would need the extra features on it, the oral-b triumph is a dandy brush. I like the angled head, the three speeds, and the charge life display. Storage base looks nice by the sink and is quite functional. Easy to separate the charger from the base to take with you for traveling. Floss brush head works well and feels good on the teeth."
4,Very Good,"After two months my teeth do seem cleaner, if not whiter. I would like it if they offered firmer bristles and/or more intense gum massage. Overall a great product that is easy to use. Highly recommended."
5,Dentist Clean Feeling!,"I absolutely love this toothbrush, I have only used it a couple times but so far I have seen a dramatic improvement in the color and feel of my teeth, exspecially the hard to reach areas that my old toothbrush failed to reach. I would definitely recommend this toothbrush to everyone!! It seriously does give you a dentist clean feeling!!"
3,Oral B power toothbrush,"I felt that the Oral B Triumph power toothbrush did not do any better than the less expensive Oral B models. It doesn,t justify the price so have returned it to the company."
2,Died after less than two years.,"I'm very disappointed in its longevity (or lack thereof). I'm going to try SonicCare next.Update: I'm doubly annoyed. I ended up getting this toothbrush again, despite it's weak battery life because it seemed to be the only one that gives the actual time of brushing, not just a signal every 30 seconds. Only guess what? They changed the brush (the exact same model!) and no longer give the time. In fact, you can see the two customer photos here still have the time, but THOSE PHOTOS ARE WRONG. That's a feature this model used to have, but no longer. There is plenty of room for it, and it obviously used to work. I guess they now moved the feature to the more expensive model with the separate monitor. Why would anyone want yet another piece to their toothbrush on the counter???"
4,"Good brush, my dentish recommended","When I went to my dentist every time, she told me I am not brushing my teeth properly. I had 6 fillings last year and a bridge this year. When I asked her, if a electronic brush would help and asked her if Philips sonicare is a good one, she told me I might want to try this one. And voila, this one is great. Though I dont like to flush everyday, I always did with reluctance. But since I started using this brush, I saw I can actually flush once in 2 days.. I like it very much it cleans well, reaches every cornoer of my teeth and though it does not replace flush, it does some of the flush action too. So highly recommended."
1,BraunTriumph Pro Care 9400 Oral-B - D25526,"This toothbrsh fell way below my expectations; primarily because it came with no added brushes; required what seemed to be a simple assembly but proved difficult. Instructions were very poor. I got a wonderful Oral-B, with three additinal brushes, from COSTCO for $[...] less than this cost. I returned the item to One Stop Shop which shipped the product. To date, this return has not bween reflected on my American WExpress account."
3,A cool floss action brush,"I purchased this Oral B Triumph Professional Care 9400 because my old Oral-B electric brush just went out of commission after more than 10 years. In the product description, they said that Triumph would stop if you applied too much pressure. But that didn't seem to be so. What really happened is the 30 seconds timer. Whenever the timer expires, the brush just paused a few seconds before resuming the operation. This action signals the time that the user should switch to a different quadrant. I used to spend about 10 minutes to brush my teeth. The timer helps to keep me in check so that I wouldn't over brushing my teeth too much even though I often go over the limit of two minutes. I like the floss action brush head that comes with the order. It made my teeth feel exceptionally clean the first time I used it. I also used the Oral-B extra soft brush head to avoid damaging my gum. The three brushing modes are not necessary. The cleaning mode is the one you need most."
1,nagging piece of #@!,"Works fine, until the temperature outside falls out of range (preset to 36 degrees) then it beeeps and beeepes and beeeepes at you. Cannot reset no matter what I do. Fun little wake up calls in the middle of the night ""yooohooo, it's cold outside"" - yea, no kidding that's why I'm tucked in my warm bed - now leave me alone.Once you smash it on the floor in the middle of the night - it's quiet."
3,"Flashy, but cute","These earrings are cute, but very flashy. I gave them to my sister and she made jokes about them being good for a bellydancer. They're ""exotic-looking"" like that."
1,A terrible couple of hours!,"This would have been a good movie were it not for Hunt and Johanssen. They were so badly miscast that they distracted from every scene . . Hunt looked like she wanted to be somewhere else, and she just didn't have the right voice, the right inflections, the right anything. Johanssen looked like a teeny-bopper wearing her mother's clothes . . she appeared so juvenile, so immature in this role that she was an embarrassment to watch. This is one move that I would enjoy seeing if they could find the appropriate actresses for the two major roles . . . would it be asking too much to see British actesses in these parts or at least American actresses mature enough to give Oscar Wilde his due? A terrible couple of hours."
2,A Bit Boring,"My cousin recommended this movie as being wonderful, so based upon that plus some of the previous Amazon reviews I got it. Frankly, I found the movie somewhat boring, and was not impressed with the acting either."
1,"Little cohesion in theme, with slight plot holes","The movie fails to come together with a cohesive tone or theme. The satirical gossip of townsfolk was juxtaposed with Scarlett Johansson's try-to-be-true drama. Marriage is scoffed at one minute, then sanctified the next. Some of the plot tweaks and added scenes from the novel also make less than perfect sense, when taken in context of the plot twist."
2,Eh.,Wasn't quite the feel I was anticipating in the beginning. It's been just a couple of days since I saw it and I can't remember much of it. I'm sure that gives you a sense of how great it was.
4,I Liked it...,A great story line with a wise twist...fantastic acting. Helen Hunt is amazing.....Costumes are beautiful and the ambiance is very realistic....I Liked it !
3,Who Makes The Loot?,"Grand Puba. Also, Kool G Rap ( yes, he can curse up a storm even against a semi-funky live beat), Ed OG, Black Sheep and even Masta Ace (the track, with its KRS 1 sample, grows on ya).Jamalski and Tiger come off, unfortunately, like those annoying drunk guys at a dope house party who pin you against the wall and breath their stinky breathe in your face, while talking a whole lotta nothing. Fast forward past their booty tracks, please.The fratrockish, Brit-funk beats, honestly, are nothing to write home about, but the novelty of a live band mixing it up with some real-life hip hop cats is enough to make this a must-have CD for your hip hop collection."
3,very early simenon,NOT UP TO LATER LEVEL. OF HISTORIC VALUE TO SIMENON FANS. DEFINITELY NOT THEBOOK TO START READING THIS SUPERB WRITER'S WORKS.
1,Water Resistant ????,"The Nautica watch was suppose to be water resistant. I received it and everyone loved the look. We went on vacation the same week and by day 4 it had water in it. I returned it to Nautica and havent heard a word from them, it has been 3 weeks. The watch looks great,and did well at time keeping, but it did not hold up in the surf.Joe F"
2,Interesting but not great.,This is a good doc if youre a die hard Gogol Bordello fan but in the end the filmmaker has personal issues while filming and it detracts it from being a great film.
1,Dud,"I bought this bell hoping it would be loud enough to hear in my shop over the other noise, but it would not work, so I ended up installing a smaller bell, which worked fine. Probably should have returned it but it seemed like too much trouble at the time. Should be a no star item."
3,"Entertaining, informative for study of NORTHERN Cheyenne","""Let's Talk Cheyenne"" is a great writers' aid for those who will depict Northern Cheyenne conversation. I thought it would help my writing project which includes some every-day talk among Southern Cheyenne who live in Oklahoma. Southern Cheyenne tribal members warned me the languages were different and I would need Southern Cheyenne translation. How true. The Cheyenne have managed to bridge the language difference--not me. I wish the Southern Cheyenne would compile a ""Daily use of the Southern Cheyenne Language"" following the same approach as this. Superior product that sets an example for Oklahoma Cheyenne students and teachers. Constance and Samuel Kritzberg"
3,The Complaints of a Crotchety Old Man,"I took a class on Japanese culture last semester, and this was one of our texts. While Tanizaki's views provide an interesting perspective, this whole essay is really just an old man talking about how traditional Japanese aesthetics are good and Western-influenced aesthetics are not. He repeatedly insults and dismisses Western ideas of beauty simply because they are Western. He may well be right, at the very least in certain aspects, by saying that the Japanese ideals of beauty are best, but his refusal to give a second thought to Western ideals makes his point moot. It's the basic fallacy of origin."
5,"Crazy, intense, drama!","One thing this show isn't: Boring. The show has a lot of drama, of course, what reality show does not have drama? Much less, a reality show about mob wives. There is more than enough drama in this show to go around and it will keep you hooked, waiting for each new episode, for sure."
1,Drum Sticks,"My 14 year old son loves Mike Portnoy, but these were the 2nd pair of drum sticks within a month. They don't last. Yes, he loves drumming every day, but they should last longer than not quite a month. We just bought 2 more pair from another company. I'm hoping these last longer. I would not recommend these sticks."
5,"This is ten times better than "" Star Wars - Episode 1 "" !!!","This was a movie that I enjoyed, thoroughly, and completely ! When I was thru watching it, I wanted to see it again. I was thrilled at the protagonist's boyish enthusiasm, which turned his dream into reality. This is a heart warming story, that will get under your skin. This is a film that you won't be afraid, or ashamed to take a friend, or family member to. I wasn't impressed with the latest Star Wars, big budget hypefest; but this is a movie that I will enjoy watching, over and over again !"
5,Good,"This was a great movie and I would recommend it to young children as well as adults that you can do whatever you want in life, and not to let others discourage you."
4,Classic Movie,classic movie. When I first saw this I was pleasently suprised. This has quickly become a favorite in my family.
5,Love the story line.,Very inspirational movie. My teenage boys enjoy watching it. There are very good story lines about overcoming obstacles and achieving one's goals.
3,"A missed opportunity, but a treat nevertheless","Having read Homer H. Hickam's wonderful memoir, 'Rocket Boys', upon which October Sky is based, I decided to buy the DVD blind as the film did not recieve a national theatrical release in the UK, my home. I must say I rather enjoyed it. Joe Johnston has made a warm, evocative film but one feels he failed to make the most of his source material. Lewis Colick's script seems to skip over or marginalise the very elements that made 'Rocket Boys' such a gripping, moving read. However, the cast is very charming, there's plenty of laughs and smiles to be had, and it's a hard heart that isn't moved at the film's end. It's no Stand By Me, but October Sky is a great film. As for the disc: picture is superb, sound a little ropey (it's hard to make out what the characters are saying sometimes), and given that the film is based on a true story, the bonus material would have greatly benefited from a documentary."
5,A Great Film,"""October Sky"" is one of the great films of the 1990's. Cinematography is excellent, acting is excellent, direction is excellend and the only criticism one can have is that the fime has an ending.The film is suitable for the entire family and is very entertaining."
2,A Perfect Time To Go And Clean My Room,"Watching ""October Sky"" was an absolute, complete waste of my time. Even though the title makes it sound great, it is the most overrated movie I have ever seen. I didn't like it, and I don't want to meet most people who's biggest ambition is to watch a movie about 3 kids setting off rockets halfway through the film."
5,Great Movie for all Ages,One of the few movies that gets the feel of that era right. Current movies and remakes focus on edginess and being extreme. This one shows that decency and a good story are not boring. No one I've shown this movie to has ever been disappointed.
2,Didn't Work:(,"I thought this was a great option as Netflix didn't have this movie available for streaming. However, I have the 1st generation IPad and it wouldn't run on that system. I didn't know this until I had already paid for it."
2,Trite and Formulatic,"The movie wasn't awful, but it was certainly nothing exceptional. The (true) story was interesting enough, but the film followed that same pattern we've all seen a hundred times before: poor boy from a dying town has a dream, and with the help of that one special teacher who makes him believe in himself, he overcomes all sorts of adversity to convince himself, his town, and of course the requisite father who Just Doesn't Understand that he can REALLY BE SOMEBODY. Of course, he triumphs in the end. Not bad, just unoriginal. Instead of this movie, try 'This Boy's Life,' a much better adaption of T.S. Eliot's autobiography."
4,Happy with the item!,"I am very happy with the product. I normally use it for mixing cake mixtures and it does the job just fine. The motor is very powerful.One thing though that the minimum speed is not very slow compared to a sunbeam one i had previously. However, its not a big deal."
4,Mixer,"Fast shipment, less expensive than local stores, works great, i have always owned black and decker hand mixers and always been happy with them"
3,Black & Deckers - Ups and Downs,"This is a solid mixer that will get the job done. It comes with whisks and beaters, which I think is great. I use the whisks for scrambled eggs, and they come extra fluffy.My gripes is that there really is no ""low"" speed on here. Even on the lowest setting, it sounds like a corvette is going to roll through my mixing bowl.Also, the plastic spatula is a nice thought, but no substitute for a real spatula. It kinda helps if you're doing cake batter, or something equally thick, but don't buy this one just because it comes with a gimmick."
1,Too fast,"I'm very disappointed with this mixer. I just got it out of the box to use it for the first time. I'm beating cream cheese, whipped cream, and sugar, but the lowest speed is so fast that it is just flinging the cream cheese around and not even blending the ingredients. What a mess!"
1,Horrible B&D PowerPro mixer,"We needed a new mixer and figured we couldn't go wrong with a Black & Decker. As it turns out, we were very wrong in this thinking. This could possibly be the worst mixer ever! Just as others have said, there is NO low speed, you turn this thing on and it throws pieces every where!!! After using this piece of junk you have to change your shirt because you will have food all over it. I think there are two reasons for this- 1. Too fast and 2. Poorly designed beaters. Also, the beaters are made of a heavy gauge wires that don't cut very well and are weak.If you just bought one of these then take it back!"
1,Worthless,"This is the only mixer our little local stores sell. We bought one that broke in two months, then we bought another and that broke within one month. Total waste of money."
1,"TERRIBLE - DIED AFTER 1.5 yrs, B&D couldn't care less","I got this exact mixer as a wedding present, and it died after I'd only been married for 1.5 yrs. I used it normally, maybe 2-3 times a month. I contacted the company about it, and they said they only guarantee it for the first year. ONE YEAR! They offered me a (and I quote), ""low cost complimentary replacement"" (which contradicts itself) for $35.50. I was horrified and wouldn't pay $36 for a mixer that will die in another year! This product is extremely low quality and their customer service was terrible - they couldn't care less that I was disappointed and would possibly tell the world about it.Save yourself the hassle of replacing a mixer in a year and buy a Kitchen Aid or Cuisinart!"
1,What a disappointment!,"This book is a BIG disappointment and not at all user friendly. The first 90 pages are the author's observations and opinions on weight loss. The calorie count portion is difficult, if not impossible to use.....instead of being individually alphabetically listed, items are classified and then alphabetized and the classification is not noted at the top of the page. ""Ultimate""....I don't think so."
4,alternative history,"Though a bit too long-winded, Roth has built a very strong case for alternative history and alternative realities that touch on culture, politics and the whole concept of humanity. This is more than just a story of 'if the Nazis had won'. It is a remarkablly prescient look into the hearts and minds of a generation or two that unfortunately reflect the divisions we see today in America. This book may become a different but similar reality in the next ten years, given the existing polarization of America and the very distinct possibility of a swing to the far right, that could mirror some of the things that are the essence of this story."
4,What if?,"This is a well done novel based on the premise that Charles Lindberg became president instead of Roosevelt in the 1940s, and is told through the eyes of a young, Jewish boy in Newark. The author writes, using his own name, as if this were a real memoir of an era of American history that never happened.Roth presents this family drama expertly, drawing complete and true characters, and demonstrating their reactions to the topsy-turvy world of 1940s America. The conceit is a smart one, and the novel delivers on its promises. The reader cares for the family, and feels their persecution.It poses an interesting question of what if. I strongly recommend this for its beautiful fictional voice, its startlingly scary premise, and its expertly drawn drama of the political and personal."
3,It's all in the details,"Let me first state that I am a Philip Roth fan and enjoy most, but not all, of his works. I found this novel hard to read. Yes there was alot of political detail, a fascinating storyline especially when juxtaposed with the Roth family, but all these great parts did not add up to a great novel. Many chapters went on and on and then certain subplots dropped with a thud. I finished the book, admired all that went into it but just did not enjoy it as much as I had anticipated."
3,Amazing premise fair execution,"I was very exticted to read this book because I love high concept books, and Roth does an amazing job of handling such a complex historical interlude. But unfortunately, I found the story a bit dull and really had to force myself to finish it. I will admit the pay off was worth it though. His writing style is lucid and engrossing, but I felt the book could have worked better as a novella."
2,Great beginning but story completely falls apart at end,"I would have given this book 5 stars two weeks ago, but goodness does it blow at the end.The anti-conservatism in the book always bugged me a smidge (it's idiotic to equate Republicans to lukewarm Fascists... that never holds up to an intelligent examination), but I was able to overlook it because of the great storytelling at the outset of the novel.I was involved, I was engrossed, I was excited about reading the next chapter.But then, towards the last third of the book, it's almost as if Roth gives up. The entire novel was used to set up the climax - what would happen to Lindbergh, what would be his downfall... and it happens in an unbelievably understated way in one entire paragraph.Never in my life have I been so disappointed or disgusted with the ending of a book. I wish I had never started it."
2,Review of Plot Against America by Philip Roth,"The Plot Against America by Philip RothI had very mixed emotions about this book. I felt it was very well written. I like seeing it through the eyes of a child. I loved the era-neighbors sitting on their stoops in the summer-everyone knew everyone else. What I found hard to deal with was the prejudice against the Jews, and I am not Jewish by the way. I also had trouble imagining Lindberg as president. I was surprised to learn that Henry Ford had Pro-Hitler leanings. I only gave it 2 stars for the above reasons."
1,Bigoted and Badly Written,"Phillip Roth has literary ability. We laughed ourselves silly reading Portnoy' Complaint in high school. But this novel is a huge misfortune. Roth's mind seems to have been poisoned by paranoia and fanatical ant-anti-Semitism to believe that America came very close to being just like Hitler's Germany. And the attack on American hero Charles Lindbergh is simply scurrilous, comparing him, bizarrely, to Adolf Hitler. Maybe this piece was motivated by a heartfelt need to defend Zionism against patriots like Pat Buchanan. I don't know. But it doesn't work as fiction (simply bad writing), and as a docu-drama it has no connection with reality."
2,Been done to death and much better,"As alternate histories go this is, at best, adequate. The only reason it's getting rave reviews is that Roth is ""Real Literature(tm)"" as opposed to the plebes who write genre fiction. Others from Phil Dick to Steve Barnes have done alternate history more carefully and thoughtfully. But they are part of the science fiction ghetto and don't get mentioned in the New York Review of Books.That aside, the story has serious weaknesses. If he's trying to take off the gloves and go to war with the forces of latent American fascism he fails. His protagonists don't need to be heroic, but if this is to succeed as a call to action they must be more bitter, impotent blowhards. It's the famous, the Walt Winchells, who are martyred. (...).In short, it's a call to navel-gazing and smug pathos, not the sort of attitude a polemic of that sort needs if it is to be effective."
2,Surprisingly disappointing,"I was expecting much more from this book. My greatest problem was that Roth seemed to lose interest in his own plot. The novel unfolds reasonably (good but not great), but very abruptly is brought to a sudden and implausible halt. Much more could have been done with this."
2,Wrong voice,"Roth doesn't do justice to a compelling concept. His particular voice doesn't sustain the intensity that this story deserves. It's as if Roth takes a superficial, flip look at what requires a consistently serious tone. It's too bad his premise wasn't developed by someone like John LeCarre.I found the book to be a real disappointment."
2,"Great Start, Bad End","I was hoping for something fresh and entertaining from someone with Roth's reputation. And at first I was not disappointed. But soon it fell into a predictable pseudo-political commentary based on wishes rather than fact. Funny how Lindbergh gradually becomes more sinister, while people like Joe Kennedy are totally missing. There are many more WWII Alternate Histories that provide a more satisfying analysis of both the characters involved and the realities of the time. Harry Turtledove, Robert Harris and Robert Conroy, among others, have produced far better examples of the genre."
3,"Great For Die-Hard Fans, But not casual ones!","A platter from their dreary early-70's phase, this is a must-have for die-hards and a must-to-avoid for fans of Saturday Night Fever. Despite being considered one of their least inspired albums, this one is not without its highlights, such as the top ten hit LONELY NIGHTS. Also memorable is the Maurice Gibb composition LAY IT ON ME, a bluesy, swamp-rockin' diddy which often found airplay on FM underground radio before the Bee-Gees became too uncool for the rock crowd in the late 70's. This, along with several other tracks on the album, is great fun to play for Bee-Gee haters who never thought the Gibb's could produce such a hard-edged sound. In short, if you like the Gibb's early stuff, you should like this...but if you are strictly a Disco-era person, I don't think You'll dig this record."
1,Kindle version is worthless,"Kindle edition badly formatted - practically unusable. Can't figure out how to return and get my buck back, so I'll warn you not to spend yours.Oh, and even though the DTE of ""Newly Revised"" links here, this is actually the 1915 edition, which is in public domain and available free elsewhere. Maybe even properly formatted."
5,1979 Paperback Edition is NOT the Kindle version!,"This is the classic 1915 edition, revised in 1979. It has extensive definitions, expanded info on motions. This is the authorized paper back edition of the classic manual on parliamentary law."
2,These dvds are not uncut & unedited,This is not the uncensored version. Some of the more explicit scenes have been cropped. It would have been nice to have known that in advance.
4,Scariest book I EVER read,"and I read it in the fourth grade. It still gives me chills.I think this is the book I read, anyways.It's about this boy who's mother dies, and his father has to make business trips, so the boy goes to live with his aunt, uncle, and cousins.His cousin, Henry, is about the same age as he is, and Henry is evil.If you can find a copy of this book, you really should try it, but it truly is frightening."
4,Handy Reference & Easy Read,"I'm currently enrolled in the National War College here in D.C., and we studied Thucydides and the great War of the Pelopennes. This book was an absolutely critical addition to my library as a military professional and student of the Art of War. If you're even casually interested in the subject, I recommend it!"
3,Not Bad,"I read this for a book club; I have never seen the pbs version. Throughout the book, I expected greater depth of development of Mary's character. I was disappointed. Mary seemed emotionally shallow and did not realistically respond to the circumstances in which the author placed her. Even her successful profession (clothier/designer) was superficial and focused on the external. Mary never really fully ""fit"", which was realistic considering her choices, the time period and the culture. There may have been interesting parallels between Richard and Mary's mother, but the author neglected to explore them. It seemed Mary married one to escape the other. I rated this as I did because it was not a struggle to read and there is much for a book club discussion."
2,The Tigger Movie: A slight disappointment,"The Tigger Movie is pretty good the first two or so times that you see it, but after awhile you realize what a disappointment this movie was. It makes Tigger the main charactet Tigger, who really is better as just a character on the side. They make Pooh seem dull and lathargic, and he doesn't have the same-well-personality. Roo adds another element of disappointment, for Roo is made out to be more annoying than ever. Piglet just doesn't have the same jitteryness either. I suggest that you rent this movie before spending your money on it."
4,What happened to the voices,None of the voices of the characters sound the same as when I was a kid. I just wanted to get that out of the way first.I thought it was a good children's movie and was very glad that it was released in theatres. That makes it a genuine movie unlike those that are made for video.
1,It was not in good condition,"This is a great movie that my son loves, but the condition of the DVD was not 'good' as it was stated by the seller. It skips throughout the movie and in some parts, it's got sucn a deep scratch that it locks the DVD up."
1,"Agree with ""too sad and scary""",I only wish I had read this review before purchasing the video! I expected my two year old grandchild to be as entertained by it as the she is by the Pooh series. Next time I'll do my research first. Thanks for providing this review.
2,Misleading,"It won't play in a regular DVD player, Didn't see where a multi-region DVD player and specific tv was required. Grandson disappointed!-("
5,Prepare yourself,"You must prepare yourself for the journey you are about to embark upon with this album. From the moving deliverance that only Pavarotti can give, to the remarkable Orchestration, right to ""The Flower Duet"" this album will never let you down. Whether you use it as background music as you prepare your favorite Italian recipe, or as a background to a wonderful evening this album has it all. It is flawless in its execution, has all of your current favorites and what soon will become your new favorites.Buy it for yourself, buy it as a gift, but just buy it- you will only regret not owning it sooner."
5,great collection,"If one was wanting to introduce a friend to the wonderful world of opera, this would be a great cd to buy them. Also at this time when many of us are worrying about Luciano and his health , it is great to hear him featured on many of the selections. A great buy and wonderful collection."
3,Riverdance - Live from NYC & The Lord Of The Dance,"Thought I'm not Irish (I'd wish I could be) I love Irish folk, music and dance, specially the tapping. I've seen these two shows and I think, joining some reviews, Mr. Flatley seems a little egocentric to me. The LOTD show is a little slow, sometimes boring. Some costumes look ridiculous. In Riverdance, thought Mr. Dunne hasn't the Mr. Flatley skills, he doesn't look overacted but natural. The show is more varied and exciting. However, bodies and faces are more visible than feet, also, long distance angles make dancers unrecognizable, sometimes It's hard to appreciate the dance performing of individuals. Finally I agree american tapping doesn't fit so much in this show neither the black ""opera"" singer. In my opinion, producers wanted to do a Broadway-like or Las Vegas-like musical from the original version aired on Eurovision in 1995. I haven't seen Feet of Flame yet."
3,"I Feel Guilty Giving It Less Than 5 Stars, But...","I absolutely love Riverdance! I've seen it live 4 times. But for some unknown reason, they keep changing it and many of those changes are not for the better. Here goes:1. Firedance is much better in it's original version where it's performed by a man and a woman.2. I don't see why the Trading Taps needs to be included. However, this is not to say that the tappers are not incredibly talented, they're just not Celtic!3. For the same reason I've never really liked the Russian Dervish dance!4. I also don't care much for ""Slip Into Spring.""5. And the original version of ""Lift The Wings"" is by far the best!6. Colin Dunne is no Michael Flatly.Now, for the two changes that are good.1. The narration at the start the talks about The Sun! Yay Lugh!2. The number called ""Heartbeat Of The World."" It's very good!"
4,"A great show, spoiled by poor editing","Wonderful dancing, wonderful Bill Whelan score. Michael Flatley is a great dancer, but I personally prefer Colin Dunne's less flamboyant style to Flatley's ""I'm the greatest!"" style. And Jean Butler is marvellous. The thing that lets the whole thing down and stops me giving it 5 stars is the editing, jumping from whole ensemble to individual to feet alone and back again. As you are dwelling on an aspect of the performance, the scene changes and you're disappointed, because you feel you've missed something. Lingering longer on particular shots and angles is the best way to enjoy dancing, and this ensemble deserves the best editing that there is. Pity it didn't get it."
5,Riverdance is awesome,This is an outstanding DVD. I highly recommend it. If you have seen Riverdance live you can relive the great moments. If you haven't seen Riverdance live you are in for a real treat with this DVD from the comfort of your own home.
2,The show was good but the transfer to DVD was AWFUL.,"I was so looking forward to this DVD but was completely disappointed. I have the original Riverdance VHS tape and was looking forward to a similar joyous event but with all of the added benefits of DVD. The performance was on par with the original Riverdance Dublin performance (better or worse depending on your comparison of Michael Flately vs Colin Dunne) but the quality of the transfer was AWFUL! The VHS tape had better quality! To my eye, it looked like the NYC performance was shot on 16mm film and a simple transfer made to DVD. No surround, no bass effect and a grainy image. Stay with the tape if you want to see this show."
1,Bad Experience,I bought this Watch but after 3 months it is not working now. I replace the Cell but still it is like dead.
1,Disappointed,"I had a lot of promise for this watch, but it came up far short. The watch was a nice size, weight and really looked nice. The problem was that it couldn't keep time, which of course was its primary function. The watch would lose between 10 - 15 minutes each day. Also, it is titled a chronograph watch, but it has no stopwatch feature. Keep shopping..."
5,Compact and jam packed,"For a little book Roy Porter knows how to pack in the information. I purchased this book while taking a course about the history of psychology. It really came in handy when it came time to write my final paper. While it is not the most comprehensive book on the market, it is full of useful and well-researched information. Another book that pairs well with this would be Edward Shorter's A History of PsychologyA History of Psychiatry: From the Era of the Asylum to the Age of ProzacWhat I liked most about Porter's book was how easy it was to navigate and thumb threw. I could quickly find the information I needed, or use it as a jumping off point. If you're studying psychology and want to know more about its mad history I recommend this book. It's entertaining and easy to read."
4,Madness,I find this book a little wordy without a lot of information in it. I was wanting to know more about how diagnosing a Schizophrenic first developed. When did people first recognize Dissociative Identity Disorder? Etc. This book just doesn't hold my interest enough.
3,An academic and reflective book.,"This book seems to be very much a sequel to Nelson's ""Embodiment."" It is a theological discussion of homosexuality from the liberal point of view such as that of John Shelby Sprong. His theological discussions are interspersed with personal narratives from his own life where he met Homosexuals, including a gay men with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. I believe that this book has more academic than personal applicability for point and counterpoint discussion."
5,Great Product,Anyone wanting to learn conversational Farsi should definitely buy this product. I really like it!
4,Excellent study guide.,Never used Sql before this book. Easy to follow and the exercises were easy to understand and do. Used it with the On-line books and passed in 11 weeks. Few corrections needed (memory allocation). Found the answers in the On'line server books. This was a good resource. The test questions were good. Do not under estimate this test.
1,DONT BUY,"LET ME START OFF BY SAYING : I HOPE THESE AUTHORS ARE HAPPILY MARRIED BECAUSE THEY ARE CROOKS . I WAS TOOLD BY MY PROFESSORS I CAN BUY THE 8TH, 9TH,OR ANY EDITION UP TO THE 12TH BECAUSE THE ONLY THINg THAT IS DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE 5 OF THEM ARE THE COLORS OF THE PICTURES !!!second , the other editions go up to chapter 15, so if u need this book for class , you are effed on your final . and if your professor requires you to do the labs in the book you only have the first 8, and then your basically effed for the next half of the semester .i didnt even use this book at all because by the time i got it ( this was very quick shipping, but i tried another company at first) it was already too late we were up to chapter nine . -____- . if you want to be successful in this class , buy one of the later editions , just dont buy this one you will be very sorry ."
1,Terrible! Boring! Confusing!,"I used to love Cussler's books, but this one was so painful I will think twice before buying another. I forced myself through about 3/4 of it before I gave up. I couldn't read more than about 8 pages at a time - I kept getting lost (and bored) Too many characters (none of which really had any character), too much jumping around from one group to another, and a really badly presented story. I read about 50 books a year, and this was the worst I have read in several years. Too bad, Clive - maybe re-read your first 8 or 10 and start using them as a guideline for the next."
1,This one bites the dust,Here are the facts. I never write reviews and I am a huge Cussler fan. I have read everybook published by Cussler and yes over the last few years they have tailed off some. But this one just blows. I kept rubbing my belly and praying that it would end. A huge waste of time and paper. Dirt and Al would have been able to take care of this business before breakfast.
2,Enough Action For A Good Short Story,"Unfortunately, Mr Cussler needs a lot of money to keep his real world NUMA salvage operations going, so he obviously made a deal to allow his name to be put on this sickly effort at writing an adventure novel. That's the only excuse I can imagine for the existance of this drawn out mess. Save your money and buy something REALLY written by Mr Cussler."
1,A hardcover by anyother name,"I recently tried to order an advertised Amazon hardcover book. Either Amazon.com does not know what a hardcover book is or they do not know what they are selling. After three failed attempts at getting the hard cover book I wanted, I have given up. I must say Amazon is very good about returning purchases, I just wish they were better at getting the right stuff delivered."
2,Very Disapointed,"I listened to this book on CD. I cannot comment on how it comes across in print. On the CD, it is a cross between Mission Impossible and Charlies Angels (albeit male angels). The reader must have used the same voice coach that was used in Kung Pow, the Fist of Death.Everything works perfectly, there is no tension and the dialog is insipid.I truely hope that this collaberation was just to get Mr. Cussler's name on the cover. It departs so much from his normal style of writing that I cannot see his hand in the story except in very few places.One other disadvantage to the CD version, you don't get the list of characters at the beginning as you do in the paperback edition.Thank goodness I got this at the public library and didn't plunk down hard earned cash for it. (Well, I guess my taxes paid for it.)I'll give the next book a try and hope that it is much better than this one. If not, I'm going looking for another Dirk Pitt."
4,good book,What can anybody say about Clive Cussler. His books and short stories are always entertaining and fun to read anytime.
2,Big disappointment.,"Clive Cussler starts a new series featuring mercenary leader Juan Cabrillo in ""Golden Buddha."" Cabrillo sails the high seas with his group of legionnaires doing jobs for governments, corporations and anyone willing to pay his price. They travel in a state of the art ship disguised as a derelict tramp cargo ship.A terrific premise and promise from one of my favorite writers.However, it is peopled with one-dimensional characters, filled with cliches, trite dialogue and stereotypes.They routinely perform the totally impossible with zero casualties. Just too preposterous---well beyond the limits of my ability to suspend disbelief.Like James Patterson, it appears Mr. Cussler is doing less and less of the actual writing---and phoning in his part.Where is Dirk Pitt when you really need him?"
4,Great book! not great formatting.,"This is a great book, I have read a few books on this subject and this is from the better ones. He gives a lot of practical advice, that may help you become a better speaker/presenter. It could be that I had an older version of the book, but the copy that I had made me a little dizzy. Some of the fonts are annoying to read etc... but it also could just be that since I work in book layout, I may be more picky. Definitely would suggest buying this book for anyone looking to polish their skills."
2,Get your nerdy helmet on... But don't drive a car.,"I really enjoyed listening to this book. It is like a journal entry of scientific observations mixed with a few stories. If you love biology and the history of scientific thought this would be a great listen. My biggest knock on this book is that the voice is a British guy who seems to just drag on, I wasn't able to ever turn this book on with my wife around she thought his voice was absolutely monotone for a Brit. (she lived in England for a couple years). I admit to falling asleep multiple times with this book on, hence why I don't recommend this one while driving in the car. If I wasn't such a fan of the history of Darwin I would have given up on listening to this book."
2,Code Name: Mediocre,"(2 & 1/2 starts to be exact) This book is the beginning of a series within a series. Skye's ""Code Name"" books all involve romances with Navy Seals. Starting with this book, the Seals are part of a surreal group with psychic-ish abilities stemming from microchip enhancements. In this book one of these special Seals is protecting a woman who trains very special dogs that will be used on missions. The woman also happens to be the sister of the Seal's friend and fellow member of his team. Sparks begin to fly between the trainer and the Seal. Like in Skye's other Code Name books, the chemistry between the two leads is set up well, but romance part of the story ends rather lamely. The dogs, however, make quite charming characters themselves and make this book more enjoyable."
5,"Does the job, nice little enclosure","This was my first ""build your own external drive"" attempt, and it was painless. The DIY instructions for inserting your own drive are simple and clear.I had trouble with one screw hole not being threaded *quite* right, but it's secure, regardless. I wish they'd built it with slightly longer screws, but the included hardware is sufficient.Data transfer speeds are as expected with USB 2.0 (and a 5400 RM drive). The included USB cable was a nice bonus.So far, this has been a solid product, and I'd recommend it to anyone, even first-timers. :-)"
3,I was disappointed,"This book was recommended to me by a friend who knew I loved reading about sci-fi and fantasy. I did completely read the book because I kept hoping it would get better. However, I must say that I was disappointed in the book. If you are looking for the ""magical"" part of Merlin - this is not your book. Oh, Merlin had visions and the gift of sight, but it seems he used his mind to make them come true. Like moving the stones was because he studied engineering and Uther begetting Arthur was deception not magical. I truely wanted the wizard part of Merlin to come to life. He was too human for my taste. When I read fantasy I want to get caught up in it. I never got caught up in it."
2,Yick.,"I read this book for summer reading. If I didn't HAVE to finish this book, I probably wouldn't have. It was somewhat interesting in parts, but not throughout the whole book. The beginning of the different books in The Crystal Cave were very boring, but then they would become more interesting as the chapters continued. The book is about Merlin, who is royal, but treated as a no-man's-child. His mother claims that his father is The Prince of Darkness. I really can't say more than that because there isn't much more to it. I didn't see a plot that lasted throughout this whole book. I was disappointed with it, but I will say it is readable."
3,three stars,"the poster art is a nice blend of american and foreign and nicely captures the evolution of the medium, but the accompanying text is seriously worthless, consisting of synopses for each film written in the worst middle-school syntax and replete with glaring typographical errors. it would have been nice to read some informative blurbs about the poster art itself, and about how hitchcock, a master or self-publicity, advertised his pictures more broadly. the cover shot on the book is from the buzz-generating psycho campaign, yet the text accompanying the psycho posters mentions nothing of the policy of excluding tardy movie-goers from the picture so as to maximize the experience. the interested reader may find a broader collection of images online, although without the crisp clarity of the photographs in this book. three stars primarily because of the disappointing text."
4,Very informative of the Will Rogers/Wiley Post accident,"The authors have spent years researching Will Rogers. In this book, they provide insight into the friendship of Will Rogers and Wiley Post. A friendship which ended in their untimely death when their plane crashed in Alaska. The book tells the biography of Rogers and Post. Will Rogers has been writtten about and spoken of often. However, it is hard to find articles about Wiley Post. This was what I was seeking when I read the book, as Wiley and I descended from the same Post family. The book contained articles which I'd never heard before. Very well written and interesting."
5,Greatest Pixar Animation ever made!!,"Toy story 2 is one of those movies you'll love to watch a billion times because of the atmosphere, related charecters and a great storyline. Most of the places made like, Al's toy barn or Pizza Planet may be imaginary but a job well done, it's now a recognizable name, and last but not least, the new charecters are greatly added to the storyline, begining the phenomemon of Woody's round up. I loved this movie and i can't wait for the third one. hope the sequel can out beat the 2nd."
5,Better than the original!,"My daughter wore out the original Toy Story tape and it won't play anymore. I thought there would be no way that the second one could be better, but I was wrong. The story is so great! Woody gets kidnapped from his yard and discovers he is an antique doll from his old TV show ""Woody's Round-up"". We meet his round-up gang which introduces us to new characters, Jesse and Stinky Pete.Woody's pals, Buzz, Potato Head, Slinky and Ham are trying to get to Al's Toy Barn to rescue him. There are some great moments in the movie that only an adult would catch (the reflection of the dinosaur in the toy car mirror ripped right from ""Jurassic Park"") which will give you a chuckle.Overall, a great story, some good tunes (Sarah Mclaughlan will make you cry) and lots of fun! Worth 5 stars."
2,Did not say Toy Story 2 on the case like in the picture,"I bought this as a Christmas gift and the movie case does not match the picture that was posted and does not specify Toy Story 2 on the case, just says Toy Story."
4,Good,The tape is in good condition. The box it came in (not sure what it is called??the dust cover for the tape??) was in bad condition. I did not think it fit the description they provided on line. They did send the item fast and the tape works great.
4,What I think of this movie.,"When I saw this movie, it was amazing.I thought it was going to be like the first one.I really enjoyed it.It was like I was on an adventure.I guarantee you this movie will blow you away!"
5,Excellent Movie,This is my daughters favorite Toy Story out of the series. It is a great movie. It look awesome in Blu-Ray too!
5,Everyone will love,This was an even funnier and clever movie than the first Toy Story. I was totally amazed at how it kept everyone laughing and each time you watch it there is something else that you notice. The plot was great and easy to understand for children and yet interesting to adults as well. I would recommend this to everyone who wants to laugh or smile. ;)
5,A good sequel?!!!,"Yup. What the first ""Toy Story"" did well, the sequel does as good if not better. The script was smartly written to give added depth to the characters and has them deal with issues that come out of leftfield but don't come off as farfethed, such as having to deal with the aspect that eventually, their owner will outgrow them. Tim Allen and Tom hanks reprise their roles as Buzz and Woody, and they are hilarious. Don't be fooled to the sequel stigma, treat yourself to maybe the best sequel in the history of Hollywood."
1,Disc in Poor condition,Tried watching this movie and the disc was so chewed up I couldn't watch five minutes straight. Next time don't sell a disc that's been chewed up by you're dog. It's very irritating.
5,Great Movie!,We love Toy Story and Toy Story 3. For some reason we had not seen this one yet. We watched this while at Disney World in Orlando and LOVED it! It was by far my favorite of the 3. Ham is hilarious and the new characters are great!
4,Toy Story 2 DVD Review,My son loves Toy Story and Toy Story 2. I personally think that the second movie is fun because there are new characters. Voices are funny and story line is good. I would recommend this movie for kids and for families.
1,"Nothing but fabrications, and innaccuracy.","Fiction and Fantasy Another book about so-called non-fiction researched by one of the worst writers to appear on Amazon. Don't waste your money. Nothing but fabrications, innaccuracy, fantasy, and bogus claims. If you want to know the facts, visit your library and find a book written by someone who knows what they are talking about."
5,My husband loved them,My husband was very excited to open these Christmas morning. He's an avid volleyball player and goes through shoes fairly quickly. Mizuno's are his favorite brand by far.
1,Not Reliable,"Had two of these over the past 2 years and both have failed with hardly any use. The first one caused me to lose quite a bit of items because I didn't make a disc copy of what I stored on it. How was I supposed to know I needed a back up for my back up? Ordered my second on in January 2008 and it died in a little over a year. Why did I order a second one? Should have learned from the first. Skip this item as a back up, it's a waste."
1,no taste,Don't waste your money on these. They have no taste at all. I used them in a cookie recipe and not one person could tell me what flavor they were. I gave them one star because evidently a rating necessary. It doesn't deserve one or any part of a star!
3,Good looking but not practical,"For the price (under thirty dollars at some sites), the quality and details of the (albeit plastic) pieces are quite satisfactory. My kid and his friends definitely love this, but more as a toy than a chess set. The problem is the size. The pieces are too big, especially for kids, and the board is too small. The pieces kept getting knocked over inadvertantly. If the board had been 50% larger, I would have given it another star."
1,This set is a joke!!!!!,"My wife bought me this set for Christmas when it first came out (for about $15). I thought it was a rip off at that price. The pieces are made of soft plastic and are way too large for the flimsy cardboard board that comes with the set. The Knight pieces barely stand up at all as they are top heavy and poorly balanced.Fortunately the pieces of this set are hollow and we were able to improve our set by using a hot glue gun to glue lead weights inside the base of each piece. Now the pieces are quite playable if one uses a full (tournament-sized) chess board.The current price that this set sells for is obviously due to its value as a collectable item. If you're looking for a playable chess set, note that you can buy far better (more playable) chess sets for just a fraction of what this set sells for."
1,This isn't Wizards Chess,"Why is it called Wizards Chess? All it is is a chess set like the set from the Harry Potter movies. At least give us a wand with a pusher at the end so we can move the pieces without touching them with our hands! This is a chess set with. Nothing special. If you already have a chess set, keep it and stay away from this toy! If you don't, buy it! It is still fun, just shouldn't be called Wizards Chess. Good day to you all."
3,great movie,I am a high school student in thornton co. i thought that the movie was great. it had a good story and never viered off of the main subject. the movie had some real good points and made most of them clear. It showed how some people should stick up for one-an-other in hard or un fair times.i would recomend this movie to any one who likes great stories and a different stile of telling them. It kept me watching the whole time so hopfully it does the same for you.Enjoy
3,was half of this movie left out or something?,"it seems like half of the real movie was left on the cutting room floor. there are so many storylines that aren't fully developed, like jamal's relationships with his male peers, jamal's relationship with his love interest, the professor's jealousy with william, etc. that it's disappointing. as a result, it is like watching a half-hearted attempt to be meaningful."
4,VERY WELL PLEASED,"THE MOVIE WAS GREAT. I USED TO WRITE IN HIGH SCHOOL SO I COULD RELATE. ANNA PAQUIN WAS GREAT AND THE SOUNDTRACK WAS HAUNTING. THE LANGUAGE IS A LITTLE STRONG BUT HEY, THEY LIVE IN THE BRONX!!"
4,Fascinating and Intriguing,"This movie, Finding Forrester, is one which at first sparked little interest in my viewing it. But, after viewing it, I was pleasantly surprised as well as pleased. This movie provides drama as well as love. Subtle comedy occasionally appears throughout the movie especially when Forrester(Connery) makes Jamal write a 5000 word essay about ""why he should stay the &#*@ our of his home"". Jamal obliges. The movie's ironic and unusual friendship between Forrester and Jamal add color and mystery to this movie. The next time that you are in Blockbuster on a weekend, you should consider renting Finding Forrester. I promise you won't be disappointed."
1,Look closely,"Notice all the alleged ""children reviews"" here? Each giving this Asylum movie 5 stars! Is this the new plan, to have the fake reviews written by ""kids"" in an attempt to fool the public? Guestar57 must finally be getting help giving his company exposure here on Amazon."
3,slow shipping,"The book was in excellent condition, but the shipping was very slow. It took 3 weeks from when I ordered the book."
2,"Poor quality, somewhat entertaining.",The special effects are very poor. The mixing of horror with humor and a teenage type script just doesn't do it for me. Not recommended.
2,lousy,"Theres nothing worse than computer graphics, not to mention trying to make a make a sequal or re- make call it what you will. sometimes things are better left alone! an absolute insult to the 80s classic American Werewolf in London. Those of you who grew up when I did know what Im talking about. AS far as Im concerned there were very few classic horror movies made from the 90s up to present time.. now everything is done with computers,Even our horror movies are now subject to this lazy key punching generation LONG LIVE RAY HARRYHAUSSEN!!!!!!!"
1,terrible movie,"I only got this movie because I was such a fan of American Werewolf in London. I was very disappointed! Bad actors, bad acting, bad script!"
3,Good.......but not great.,"I haven't seen the original (though I REALLY want to), so maybe that's why I didn't understand everything, but I still liked it.......to a certain point (check my title). I saw it last June on Fox, so it was obviously edited, and I had expected it to be really scary, but it wasn't. Startling, but not horrifying. The ending involves a secret group of werewolf renegades, and that got pretty silly. But it stil has it's good moments, like the suspenseful sewer chase scene, and when the werewolf woman's dead mother, a rotting corpse, comes into the room and scares the pants off of her boyfriend. The biggest disappointment, however, were the ... special effects, with really ... computer-animated werewolves. Not as good as ""Silver Bullet"", and definitely not as good as ""Wolf""."
1,Horrible,"This is a terrible movie and it's a shame it's even associated with one of my all time favorites, An American Werewolf in London. The animation here is novice, the acting is bad, the script is silly. Overdone, overproduced, overkill. Skip this one."
1,"A pathetic attempt at a ""Sequel""","This movie is pathetic. you could never compare this to the classic an american werewolf in london, it's just not possible. i only saw it once & that's enough for me."
4,FULL MOON FUNNIES,"I liked this movie; it's not quite as ""novel"" as its predecessor, set in London, but it still has some fresh and chilling moments. I didn't mind the CGI werewolves, they were kind of neat. Here's some other thoughts:*PHIL BUCKMAN might have made a better hero than TOM EVERETT SCOTT; where Scott had the boyish naievete down, he didn't have the physical swagger or heroic drive that Mr. Buckman had. Buckman should have gotten more screen time.*JULIE DELPY didn't put enough ooomph in her role, either. She's lovely, but listless.*I never understood exactly what Delpy's father was trying to do, and whether by the end Delpy was still a werewolf?*Julie Bowen was a howl as the ditsy pickup, and even funnier as one of the walking dead.*Why Did Delpy think she was the one who had werewolfized Scott?A pleasant, if inconsistent, diversion."
2,Yuck; they should have left well enough alone,"I was eager to see this movie, having loved the original ""American Werewolf"" movie; but was sadly disappointed. I didn't care at all for the characters, the humor was missing completely and generally it stank up the screen. Mark me off if you don't agree - I know you rude lot will anyway - but that's my story and I'm sticking to it."
4,An In Depth Look at Teddy Roosevelt,"This in depth biography gives a side of Teddy Roosevelt that most people do not know about. It lists events that not only helped shaped his political career and social image, but events that gave a more personal view of the President, from his childhood asthma to his physical weaknesses. The book speaks of his thoughts, opinions, and views on several topics, such as art, nature, sports (football), his marriage, and great literature. Had T.R. lived to read this biography about him, I am sure he would have regarded it as a great work of literature, that may have been to long, but gave a great view of the legend, Theodore Roosevelt."
3,Union bias,"On the scene reporting with direct access to union affairs. However, a strong union bias--acknowledged by the author.Consequently misses the most important lesson, i.e., corporate campaign does not work and nor does traditional union tactics."
3,Decent information,"Do not kid yourself; the 32mm system of cabinet building is very complex. It was designed as a way to standardize cabinet construction and to use mass-production machinery.Translating this to the smaller shop and making use of standard tools is not easy. It is an unforgiving system where all holes and measurements have to be PERFECT or it fails.It also turns out that there are deviations in the standards and the way builders interpret them.While this book certainly is valuable and gives a nice overview, it is short on the details small shops or home-owners really need. For example, the attachement of drawer sliders and the use of different drawer mechanisms is glossed over.Get the book, but be prepared to spend a lot of time researching other sources. I ended up with some really nice projects, but it weren't easy, as they say."
1,Perfect for a Trailer,"The book provides a reasonable overview of the history of this sort of construction and provides basic techniques and information about tools and materials needed. Little attention is spent on construction from materials other than melamine, with the result that the products displayed look ""bottom-of-the-line""--little to encourage you to build in this design. This was a great disappointment. I was hoping for a discussion of how to build handsome, European-style cabinets. Given the limited information of use, it was mostly a waste of money."
2,big disappointement,"How I expected this double cd!!! but I should have known that tributes these days are three a penny and very rarely they seem to convince. It seems that many famous people were invited to this party and when they came not really dressed as they should and not really in the mood nobody could tell them to leave. Such is the cover of Springsteen, almost to make you weep. A bizarre reggae song by Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt (Did Seeger write that?) and many etcetera. Not all is lost, Greg Brown, John Gorka and Anni difranco give some good songs, but even these songs would be considered fillers in any of their albums. Before you buy this cd try to listen to it at a friends. I consider it the disappointement of the year."
2,Style over Substance,"Considering the hype and sys spec req, I was expecting ""gameplay + graphic"" enjoyment; wrong. Just another FPS. Nothing special and at times very frustrating."
3,Nice But...,"I liked that these pieces were sturdy, heavy, and thick wood. I do wish that they were painted on both sides. When I opened this, there was fine wood dust on everything."
5,Perfect to teach abc's,This is the perfect way to show your little one the alphabet. My sons only 2 and he has known his alphabet since he was 1 so the next best step is to teach him how to recognize the letters and this puzzle is perfect! What I do is lay all the puzzle pieces out and ask him for a letter if he gets confused and can't find it I can tell him for example give me the letter A for apple or alligator and he'll know right away because each letter has a picture on it. I feel it helps toddlers remember things more effectively. Over all I am ver pleased with the puzzle good quality very smooth on the edges and the pieces are perfect for toddlers and little hands because they are chunky and very easy to put in their spots.
2,Cheap Wood & Paint from China,"This is a cheap version of an american classic. Kind of sad, really. Lead paint? Pressure-treated plywood laced with chemicals? Ugh..."
2,Melissa and Doug Jumbo ABC Chunky Puzzle,The puzzle is only to be used with parental monitoring as children put things in their mouth and this has paint or covering that can come off in child's mouth. Not for 2 to 3 y.o which is the age this toy is best used for.
2,"great puzzle, bad quality","I bought this puzzle for my son when he was 1.5yo and he learned his alphabet with it by the age of 2. It was great fun and he loved carrying letters around. Obviously, most of them got lost after traveling with him to the park and daycare. The puzzle was of great quality, durable, with bright colors - no complaints. So, now that I have a daughter, I decided to buy her the same exact puzzle and was very surprised to receive something different. Unlike the old puzzle, each letter has been painted only on the front. The edges of the letters are unpainted and very rough and the back of the letters are unpainted, though not so rough. I don't think it could give my daughter a splinter, but it just isn't so pleasant for the little fingers to touch, let alone putting it in her mouth (just unavoidable). I wonder if I just received a defective one. The problem is - I already opened it and sending it back would be a hassle."
2,Live At Last The Audience along with special guest star Stevie Wonder,"I have waited for over 25 years for a definitive DVD by the great Stevie Wonder. I saw him in concert7 years ago and he was awesome. This product showcases the audience more than it does the artist.One or two audience participation/sing-a-log songs is OK, but a dozen? Come on Stevie, the crowdcame to hear you. He didn't do this 7 years ago. I believe that the death of his mother two yearsago has greatly changed his slant towards music and performing. The audience sings on half of his songs,while he simply plays along. That is not the Stevie Wonder that I know. This could have beenone of the truly great DVDs/Blu-Ray discs of all-time, but it is flawed due to the above."
4,Little ain't little anymore,"Great show! the set was creative, the backup musicians were all first rate. Some of the audience participation songs could have been deleted"
5,wonderfull,"Stevie Wonder and a great backup band at their best. Great DVD to work out to, as the beat keeps you moving."
1,not dependable,"The book doesnt contain most of the informations which is hardly needed by the students, especially those who are in college. In short, it is incomplete."
3,lots of problems with the sports cap,"It's possible I just got a bad unit for the cap, but this thing is *impossible* to open with your hands; I had to use my teeth, even then it takes a good tug, and you end up with sorta sharp tooth-mark gouges.I wanted to use this as my sports bottle, since I realized I go through 2-3 normal water bottles in a 3 hour match, but the cap is so non-functional, I have resigned to just keep the cap open and use it at home.Aside from the cap, it's a pretty good bottle, it holds enough for me to not have to refill it more than once a day, and doesn't really take up that much more of a footprint on my desk than a regular water bottle. If it had a decent cap, 5 stars. I'll be looking for replacement caps for sure."
2,The cap's basically unusable,"First off, there are some great things about this jug. The bottle itself is durable, and it doesn't smell or taste like plastic. Also, the handle is sturdy and convenient.BUT--at least on the jug I received--the cap is basically unusable. the mouthpiece is really hard to open--the only way I've been able to open it is by biting and pulling it with my teeth...not a safe method! I thought that maybe it would get easier each time, but NOPE. I just tried it again this morning, and it's still much too tight for use. Now I'm just using it at home, where I can leave the cap open all the time. But for the car or the gym, or anyplace else you might need to close the cap sometimes to avoid leaks? Fuhgeddaboudit."
1,Never even got to use it,"I bought this water bottle at Bed, Bath, & Beyond a few days ago (same price). I realized it had a tiny hole in it when my t-shirt began to get soggy as I filled it. I'm returning it tonight.Great theory (all your daily water in one receptacle); poor execution."
3,Just OK,"First of all the bottle felt pretty durable at first. I thought it would be good. However, afer having this thing for a little over a month, it leaks from the side. Somehow a small pin size hole is in the side. I have no idea how this could have happened. I take it to work and it sits on my desk all day then I bring it home and do it again the next day. I don't know how it started leaking, but it does. Also, the top is tough to put in the open position. Its a squirt bottle style lid. So you have to pull up to have it in the open position. However, its tough to open so the best way is to use your teeth. When you do this a few times the lid starts looking pretty rough. So within a week your bottle looks beat up and old. I expected better for 8$. There are better ones out there for that price."
5,Great Camera absolutely LOVE IT,"I love this camera, i upgraded from the EOS 20D in May of this year and have already taken 10000 pictures with the 30D this camera is great and if you are a serious photographer you should think of getting one. I purchased the body only as i already had canon lenses and at 5 frames per second great for shooting in RAW Format.review work at [...]"
4,It works,"Purchased with 28-135 lens kit from Amazon last summer. Good walk around combo. When shooting indoors without flash, I use a 50mm f1.4. So far so good."
2,Glued-together episodes from an ancient series!,"Well, this brings back memories! Very, very early memories, of course. I must have seen these episodes when I wasn't even ten years old. And indeed, it all comes from the 1972 HTV series, of which a few episodes or fragments were chosen to create a movie. And as a movie, I'm sorry to say, it is not worth the name! The colours are often so bad the whole screen turns green (no green knights to be seen...)There is no acting worth mentioning, and the settings are worse! Then why two stars? Because it still represents a daring, non-glamour version of King Arthur, the semi-barbarian so to speak; fighting in mud and bushes, instead of those glittering knights (though some a presented on the cover..) And, of course, because of that delightful young Brian Blessed, Har har!"
2,Not as it good as it should have been,"With a smaller budget, a thin plot line, and the unwelcomed absence of Roddy Mcdowall, this sequal can prove hard to watch."
4,To alert the snowplow driver,"I bought this to alert the snowplow driver of my recently posted property number. Shortly after the sign was installed, the plow hit and bent it. Hopefully this will prevent another occurrence."
5,"A wonderful read, written by a master craftsman.","I felt a newness reading this book. If everyone could read this wonderful story to their children at bed-time, the world would truly be closer to heaven."
5,Intriguing and beautifully written,"Very intriguing. So beautifully written, like poetry. The images were so beautiful. The emotional impact was intense."
1,"Awful, awful, awful sub-standard packaging","Awful, awful, awful sub-standard packaging-each disk is in a paper sleeve then the sleeves are stacked and jammed into a coster-holder looking structure in the center of the case. Who though this was a good idea? Not to mention EVERY disk in this set is scratched. Come on. I paid $50 bucks for this?"
1,So disappointing.,"I read The Wisdom of Insecurity by Alan Watts several times over the years. I loved it. I thought this tape would reinforce the principles I fell in love with. But, alas. This tape is gibberish. Nothing useful. Nothing as make-sense and ""ah-ha provoking"" as his books. Don't waste your money."
2,hmmmm,"This is a decent casual medical dictionary, for the medically curious, but if your looking for help with terminology on the professional level, spend the money and buy something better.... like Taber's"
1,pesimo producto,"muy malo el dvdpesima calidad de imagen, el menu es espantoso, muy bajo nivelme arrepiento de haberlo compradodemasiados episodios para un dvd"
5,Buy This Movie Now!,"Wyatt Earp has one of the most remarkable stories in the history of the American West. While this may take some artistic liberties (more than Costner's Wyatt Earp) it is still one of the greates westerns of all time. Russell and Kilmer are phenominal in their best performances and the entire ensemble cast is perfect. You feel like they had the best time of their lives making this wonderful movie. Tombstone and Wyatt Earp may be about the same subject but both are vastly different, nearly equally great films and while I love Costner's film I will give the slightest edge to Tombstone and rate it as one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time."
3,Variations on a theme,"I think that the effect of this movie was really hurt by 2 versions of the Earp brothers and the gun fight at the Okay Corral coming out within about 6 months of each other. The other movie being ""Wyatt Earp.""The gun fight was more accurate than previous movies about Wyatt Earp and his quest for revenge/justice, but it wasn't as accurate (according to court documents) as ""Wyatt Earp."""
4,Good version of the story,I like this version of the story it's different than Wyatt Earp and shows a different side to the characters and their relationships.
3,"Just like ony old western, except...","Tombstone is about the Immortal Wyatt Earp and his brothers in a town called Tombstone where they came to make a new living but took up the side of the law again to fight evil cowboys. There are running horses, saloonfights and a lot of gunbattles, so nothing new there. And a little romance of course. Even the titles in the end scene are western likeWhat makes this movie stand out a little about the others is the acting performance of Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. His accent is perfect and he plays a dying man very convincingly. This is the only reason you should really see it."
2,Needs Better Sound,"I love the movie, but it's a shame that it's only offered in 2.0 sound. In this day and age all DVD's should have 5.1 or DTS. Again, it's a great movie but I'd like to see a second release with ""real"" surround sound! The 2.0 surround sound dosen't do the gun fights any justice."
2,I guess it's ok...,"Tombstone is a story of some of the most famous law enforcement officers -- Wyatt Earp & co. -- from the old wild west. Once they have retired, they settle into a town where the red sashed mobsters rule. As the movie progresses, the mobsters provoke Earp & co. to the point of coming out of retirement.This movie features the famous shootout at the OK Corral, but goes far beyond that in the lives of these law men.Before seeing this movie, I heard it was an incredible movie. Maybe I just came into it with expectations that were too high, so I would warn anyone that if they have not seen Tombstone before that they not keep their expectations too high. Otherwise, you may be as disappointed as I was."
3,"Too ""Hollywood""","A very entertaining move, but lacked any historical value. Hollywood needs to learn how to entertain and be historically correct. The ""Cowboys"" were so glamourized they were beyond believable. However, Val Kilmer was the best and most acurate Doc Holiday to date. No one knows what really happened in Tombstone, but this tale was a bit tall."
2,"This is a great movie, but not for big screens",This is one of the best movies ever made but the poor picture quality cause the low score. by low quality i mean not enhanced for 16:9 tvs. If you own a 27 inch or smaller the dvd quality looks great. if you have a big screen tv buy the vista series tombstone DVD. it cost less and has superior video quality. (The movie gets 5 stars)
2,"BLU-RAY review, not a movie review","The black levels are HORRIBLY crushed to an embarrassing degree. The entire movie is way too dark and there's zero detail in any of the darker scenes. Watch 5 minutes of The Dark Knight and then 5 minutes of this and you'll see what I mean. I saw this recently in HD on a cruddy and compressed satellite movie channel and I think it looked better than the Blu-ray. The only positive is that sound is pretty solid, but since this if one of my favorite movies and I'm clearly upset about the picture quality it will probably collect dust on my shelf next to Point Break..."
5,AWESOME AS ALWAYS,"I loved it it was just as perfect as always, if you already love it get it in blue ray. Can't go wrong."
4,can i say 4++?,"yes, same as for the maui guide, though i liked this a tad morei travel alot and i'm a reader/researcher as i do all planning myself (i enjoy this task almost as much as the trip itself) ... love DK books!!!! still do .. but, stumbled upon these guides courtesy of amazon reviews and was not disapointed .. loved the way they were organized ... loved the way they covered variety of topics (ie i'm a diver and it was great they didn't just list what they thought were the 3 dive shops but rather a dozen with there preferences and why and then for those they didn't like a reason why so you could choose .. highly recommend the variety/choice by topic/adventure .. good investment"
3,Its aight... could be better though.,"JACO IS GOD...enough said on that note. But this video does not show him at his full potenital. And if you want to learn from it not only do you have to buy the video, but the book on this is sold seperetly. Its all just a bunch of scales for exersises. Great interview though i must say. I also enjoyed the jams at the end."
5,What I use,"Gets dirt and crud off.Works with a mitt.Works with a foam gun.Works on wheels.Can be used to wash the outer layer of a wax or sealant without stripping if you're quick and gentle.Will take wax or sealant off if you slather it on and work it.Smells good without being overpowering or noxious.Doesn't hurt my hands.Doesn't stain my driveway (though the brake dust it takes off the wheels can do.)Little goes a long way.Basically, it does everything right; only brand I've found that does. I'll probably continue to use it. Don't store the bottle on its side; the cap isn't designed for that, will leak, will make a big mess."
4,The celery is a stalker!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Bunnicula i on the loose! Three animals try to find a bunny they named Bunnicula while stabbing all the ""evil"" celery stalks.They end up with a dumpster oder and a big suprise!I'm not going to say anymore or I'll give it away but it's a great book I reccomend to anyone that likes funny books."
4,Bunnicula is good but still second best,"Bunnicula stands as a timeless series of poetically woven rhetoric. However, Bunnicula's literary teeth cannot sink nearly as deeply as the eternal chasm that is geckicula. If you have not heard of Geckicula, let me explain. Geckicula stands alone as the first dracula-animal playoff and rendered all others wholly unnecessary. Bunnicula is a touching series but essentially ends up as nothing but the blood on geckicula's teeeth"
2,Feedback,Quite a presentable table lamp except the glass shade is too thin & very fragile. Will be a preferred to buy item if the glass is not fragile & easily break.
4,Another wild HK action flick,"Time and Tide is another of the seemingly endless Hong Kong action flicks. As far as story goes I'm not quite sure I got it all, but when it comes to the action scenes it delivers masterfully. Hark continues to use the camera in different ways, as reflected by a haplass thug walking into a corridor filled with grenades. The camera does a ""bullet time"" pan around the thug as the grenades go off. Anyone who's seen Swordfish will recognize the similarities in the shots. Also, the shootout in the tenement building is a truly inspired scene. Characters running along walls, rappeling down chutes...some wonderful stuff. I do think it gets a little slow leading into the final action scene with a masterful Wu Bai acrobatic showdown in the catwalks above a packed arena. If you like this kind of movie you don't even need to read a review. I only wish I had caught Time and Tide in it's limited US theatre run!"
1,Not worth a look,"This book is is about programming Internet programs in Visual Basic. However, over 200 pages talk about VB Script and over 200 pages are filled with program listings. The remaining 150 pages are useful if you don't know how to put a component on a form or how to use Visual Basic. The CD is basically a waste of time as it contains on 2.2Mb of code listings without advanced examples of topics described in the book. This book was obviously hastily assembled to catch the VB5 wave of Internet programmers but it is going in the wrong direction. If I lived in the US it would be going back to Amazon for a refund. If you know how to read the VB5 manual then don't waste your time."
4,The Truth about Truth?,"Always polarity when first hearing philosopher's topics, e.g. All Truth is God's Truth? What does this mean?Holmes wants to unload this for us, and does so in very readable and understandable fashion if one focuses on this well-written expose.He laments relativm's impact upon truth and even in church, where common pastoral, devotional and bible study ways are more therapeutic and emotional than truth based. Pragmatism and other concerns pervade too much, playing right into hands of aggressive anti-objective truth scholars.Positing that there is real truth outside of revealed sacred, God=inspired Scripture is true. However, we must realize and confess that such truth is not spiritual truth, dealing with relationship between Creator and Creature but of earthly, worldly matters which Bible doesn't address.Interesting read to ponder."
1,Craptastic,"This could possibly be the worst thing I've ever seen... And I've sat through The View at least twice. Do not watch unless you care about your IQ dropping by the minute. As a comedy, it's almost as funny as cholera...not so funny. Your time would be spent better elsewhere...doing anything."
3,Fascinating ideas but poorly edited,"Furedi's interesting book explores how self-reliance and problem-solving through informal relationships have been gradually replaced by a therapeutic culture that, by medicalising everyday behaviour, encourages helplessness and promotes new forms of social control.This book was well worth the read because the ideas were so fascinating, but one could be put off by the atrocious copy editing. Compared with Furedi's earlier well-edited ""Paranoid Parenting,"" ""Therapy Culture"" had numerous distracting grammatical and spelling errors. It would have deserved a higher rating had it been better edited."
3,DONT BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ...,"READ LA ATREVIDA or the books by Aline or Karina Yapor to make your decision. I don't dislike Gloria, and I do think that in a sense, she is also a victim. However, she clearly loses grasp of reality often. It is important to get first hand information from other sources as well, AND to understand the Mexican Culture at the time."
5,Fantastic introduction to true Hawaiian spirituality,"This book should be read by anyone who is interested in Hawaiian or indigenous spirituality. One of my favorite quotes from the book: ""The main lesson I learned at my school was not of potions, it was to see with the ""inner eye,"" to see things with the heart. To understand the other person, we tried to be in tune--to the people, and to the environment. It was learning kindness and concern, not only for ourselves but for all people and all matter. We were taught a value system that laid aside all material things."" Wise words for our world today."
5,a new perspective,"i've never been a huge thor fan, i always thought the character was a little dated, and in the half a dozen or so thor stories i've read, the dialogue and artwork just did'nt click with me. in this excellent hardcover, however, even those who are'nt thor enthusiasts will be wowed by the impressive story and spectacular painted artwork. loki is of course the focus, and this change in storytelling perspective allows the reader to see both the malevolent trickster and his noble stepbrother in a way they have'nt been seen before. in the current glut of continuity-laden drivel that marvel is pumping out as i write this, fans of finite,well written and visually stimulating tales will definitely enjoy this book. highly recommended,particularly for someone who has'nt read a marvel comic in a while...check this out and read it slowly and thoughtfully, and you'll realize that once in a while the company can produce a fine piece of art."
5,One of the Greatest Sci-fi Masterpieces,"When I read this book, it was breathtaking. Every line is so well written that it captures the heart, and at the same time, makes you think. One of the most well written sci-fi stories in history. A. A. Attanasio is also one of the greatest science fiction writers in history. He is very clever when using his imagination - he brings the reader into his world.This book is a triumph. It should be hailed for all time. I loved it."
3,quite a disappointment,"this book was not at all what it promised to be: ""shadowy and sinister... a pate turner""? i think not. it was tedious and somewhat boring, even, and i only finished it to get it over with. the ending was inconclusive, as though there should have been more, and Kelman failed to wrap up the plot satisfactorily. it seemed... rushed, as though she threw it on there so she could say it was over, rather than having searched and planned for the perfect ending. it was an alright book but still not the thriller i've been looking for, and it was definitely not what i'd expect from a Mary Higgins Clark award winner. it was bland to say the least, but perhaps that's just from my thriller-seeking point of view."
1,absolutely boring,"This was the hardest book I've tried to read in a very long time. The characters were unappealing (even the heroine), the plot was boring, and there was absolutely no suspense. Don't waste your time or money on this one!"
5,Great read!!!!,Judith Kelman has reached new heights with Summer of Storms. I was hooked immediately and couldn't put it down ...I can't wait for her next release!
2,Used Book,"I ordered this book(as a gift) once before from Amazon and the seller said it was brand new and when I received it there were underscores throughout the book. I did not now of the underscores until I gave the gift. So I wanted another one for a gift and purposely ordered from another seller. They stated it was BRAND NEW!! It was not!!!! It had an inscription on the very front page. The [...] mentioned that it was ""new, never read but name written inside front cover"". What am I supposed to do now!!! I will have to cut the page out to give it as a gift. I don't think I will ever order from Amazon again. The first seller suggested I return it for another. Number one, I already gave it away and number two, I wasn't paying shipping to return it and take a chance of getting another used book."
1,"Big toaster, big mistake","I bought this toaster because of the KitchenAid brand name, and because I thought any toaster gutsy enough to come with a $200 price tag might be able to toast a slice of bread in less than five minutes. Big Mistake. KitchenAid quality control must have been absent when this behemoth went down the assembly line. Even white bread set at the highest number on the temperature setting does not brown and it takes LONGER to NOT do it. Frozen waffles? Forget it. You have to put them through the cycle TWICE and they still don't resemble anything you'd want to put syrup on. I'm pissed that I didn't research the product better. I hope this saves others from making the same mistake."
2,"Beautiful toaster, lousy toast","This toaster looks beautiful on the kitchen counter. Unfortunately, it did not produce great toast. It toasted unevenly (one side toasted, the other just warm), and I needed to run two cycles to toast my frozen bread, even with the darkness control set to the darkest setting. I don't recommend this toaster if you freeze your bread."
1,slow to ship it.,"slow to ship it. if you need the battery while you are till alive find another source, this place may not have a stoke or ship once a month."
4,Entertaining,"If you are a pro trader like I am I tend to doubt you will find, read or learn anything that will make you money at least consistently, just like 98% of what is written about finance.I gave 4 stars because it's some of the best "" financial pornography "" published out there. The entertainment value you get for the weekend is good."
1,Barrons,"I have never received the magazine, receive Barrons paper sporadically but am finally getting it. I have tried to cancel talking to your magazine company and Amazon with no success . I am very disappointed in this and this is the first problem I have ever had with Amazon. I bet Jeff would not be a happy camper."
3,Continues to provide good service,I bought my goggles about 20 years ago (actually four sets) and the repair kits have been inexpensive and well made.
4,I remember this from childhood,"There are certain stories you read in childhood that stay with you forever; I don't know exactly why this story has stayed with me so, but certainly it has. Hedwig's uncertainty and her desperate need to find a place to feel loved and safe were very well portrayed. I can remember reading about her loneliness even now, a good twenty years later."
3,"Normally 5 stars, but edited version of song is not from the original album","This is a great album. Unfortunately, this is not the whole album. The song I Know I'm Losin you is about 10 minutes and has some great jamming. The short version included here is probably the single version of the song."
5,One of Zappa's best!,I love this album! I used to listen to it way back in the 80's! I had to buy it and it is as good as I remembered it. Zappa goes from jazz to funk to symphonic all in one album!
4,excellent,"One Size Fits all may be the best in the trilogy with Zappa having George Duke in his band of Mothers aces. The other two albums areOver-Nite SensationandApostrophe (').On One Size, Zappa thinkens the groves and pumps the volume. The numbers here have the same rich funky char of the other two albums, but the rounder bass playing and raised ampifacation make this music heavier, and this supports massive solos, such as Zappa guitar juggernut, ""Inca Roads.""There are also more backup vocals here, and if the music on Apostrphe sounded just a little thin at times, that on One Size Fits All more than compensates.Zappa seems to, here, have fully developed how to match the simpler, riff-based music he was exploring with this band to the rigourous musicanship he always aspired to and always succeeded at. You can listen to this as art rock or funk.As long as you listen. Soon."
1,This was written by a JOURNALIST??,"I read a lot of true crime books, and this is one of the very few that went right in the trash when I finished it. This book is supposedly written by a journalist, but Birkbeck is more of an opinionated boor, in my opinion. His continual comments upon the character of everyone associated with this unsolved case is more than annoying, it is cloying and leads me to believe he must have a stake in this case in some sick way. Is he obsessed with or in love with the detective (Becerra, or whatever his name is -- I don't have the book in front of me; it's in the trash)? This is an unsolved case. Many law enforcement people have worked many long hard hours on the case, but in the author's opinion there is only one of them who ""really cares"" .... Give me a break! No wonder Birkbeck writes for People magazine rather than one of the more respected magazines available today. Disgusting! Boring book! Breaks no new ground. Ick"
3,"Useful, but very weak on Western China (10th ed.)","Although the 10th Edition provides useful information, I found its coverage of Western China extremely dated. Indeed, the information was so stale that a resident expat in Kashgar questioned whether LP visited Xinjinag prior to releasing the new edition."
2,Disappointing installment from LP,"I have used Lonely Planet guides since 1996 to help me travel to nearly 30 countries and until now, I found them the best resource available for getting off the beaten tourist-track. Unfortunately, this edition of LP China disappoints. I like the logistical information (I give an extra star for that), but I am really dismayed at the emphasis given to popular spots, ""backpacker meccas"", places ""beloved by backpackers"", ""a good place to 'kick back'"", etc. It even goes as far as to show contempt for people looking for the ""'real China'"". I think I will look for another title, and if there is not a better one out there then I will write my own. As LP is alienating their core market here, maybe a new opportunity opens for new writers..."
5,nombie NATION!,THIS SONG is da bomb it is at like every party i go to it is so popular right now that if your a dj you better go cop it now i mean now this is the dopest song an instant classic in dance proggressive house house and trance music this joint right here is meant to be played loud as possible prefferably in residential neighborhoods and night clubsIm White
4,Every sports fan should have this,"It took me a while to find this CD, but once I did I was very happy. This is the anthem you should hear before every sporting event. It really pumps you up!! I love it."
2,didn't work,it was too stiff and didn't mold to the bulb - so was no help at all. Would not buy it again
3,Does not come with an extension of any kind,Shouldn't be called Mr. Longarm if it does not come with an extension. Ok Ok you can use a broom handle or some other appropriate pole but they should warn you that the thing is only 8 inches long when it comes out of the box. It is only fair.
3,Pop-up Pirate,I run an in-home family childcare. I have a 3-year-old boy who likes to play this game. He gets some excitement when sticking the swords into the barrel and waiting for the pirate to pop up. He doesn't realize that it is the same place that pops up the pirate every time. It's an okay game for the price.
1,Poor quality,The pirate pop up was sent to me damaged. I have used this game previoulsy in our clinic but this one won't work.
3,pirates,"Kids enjoy the anticipation of popping up. I am somewhat disappointed, since a few boys learned real quick, how to locate the slot that will trigger the pirate to pop up. This, I feel, takes away the fun of surprise."
3,Pop up pirate?,"This is a cute game but It doesn't always work real well . The Pirate won't lock down in the barrel as expected. They could have also included a little bag for storing the swords so that they don't get lost, they are very small and it doesn't include any extras.Its still a neat game for the price."
5,True OEM holster,"This is the real thing not an aftermarket, you can find an aftermarket for 3-4 dollars but they don't really work. This is same thing you pay $20 for at a Nextel store."
2,"Dull, Bland Taste","I've tried other Guiltless food items but these were bland and boring. I bought them because I cannot tolerate wheat/gluten and had hoped that this would be a nice alternative. I opened the bag, ate one, reclosed the bag and put it away. I'll feed it to my nephew instead. I give it two for attempting to make it a tasty treat."
3,The last four songs make the album.,"Toto misses the mark with a few of the songs on this album, but with the others the band continues to showcase that rare ability to play well across musical styles. The best illustration of this flexibility is the trio of songs at the end of the disc. ""Mama"" is a R&B tune that could have easily been sung by one of the black artists of the era. ""White Sister"" is an example of a straight ahead rock'n'roll piece of that period, with a blistering guitar solo by Lukather at the end. ""Secret Love"" is keyboard-only tune with the lyrics added almost certainly as an afterthought.Not the best Toto album, but ""Mama"" and ""White Sister"" alone are worth the purchase price."
5,Toto flyin' high,"Holy cow! After hearing the two Toto albums that had ""Hold the Line"" and ""Africa"" on it, I didn't think the band had the ability to make a coherent album. I was wrong! This is truly a magnificent album the entire way through. That was the main problem with the previous Toto albums- some good songs mixed in with some bad. Not so with Hydra. If you have to own only one Toto album, make it Hydra! The songwriting is exceptionally strong and memorable!I'm so relieved Toto has an album in their catalog that's highly enjoyable the whole way through. Maybe the final track is the weakest (it's a short ballad) but there's no use in complainin'.Great stuff."
3,not thrilled with the company,"I purchased this for my son for Christmas, it arrived quickly and I was pleased, but I was busy and didn't open the package for a couple of days, only to find they sent ""see it and say it in german""., I uickly contcted them about this with no response, I was clear I wanted to resolve this before Christmas. I sent another email through my personal email, not thru this site like earlier. It made no difference, The good news is the pice is very reasonable so I purchased another book before Christmas, it arrived just as quickly and before Christmas. So my son got both the Spanish & the German versions, although he did ask what he was going to do with the German version. Not happy with the company"
3,NOT SCAREY BUT INTERESTING,Well I am an Unsolved Mysteries fan so I guess this was just disappointing compared to that. There were some good stories but overall it was just very slow and generic. The host is very boring and old. These videos were made very cheap and they try to make it scarier than it is. If you want something to sit back and keep you entertained this may not be the video but if your interested in ghosts and stories about them you should check it out.
5,Horrendously cheesy fun,"Good, corny fun of a magnitude similar to that of Edward Mulhare's timeless classic, ""Secrets and Mysteries"", only this time, the distinguished English host is Patrick Macnee, who does a great job hosting these somewhat silly, low-budget ghost stories.The ""special"" effects and goofy synth music and noises just aid in the good serving of cheesy fun that these episodes provide.A few times, the investigations are so simplistic and dry, you can't help but watch the video, furrow your eyebrows and go, ""what?""But who cares! Are you really watching these for informative information, or are you just looking for a quantum of cheesiness?"
4,good book,"Suggested by a friend, this book encourages and strengthens a parent's plan to help a child grow into a mature person!"
4,GOOD BOOK!??,This book has all the great Beatles hits and its transcription to piano is almost perfect.BUY IT!!!
1,Again....too small,Totally agree on the size of the book. It says 8X8 which could be either inches or cm. Was extremely annoyed when I received this book. Great text but would love to have the full sized version. I have ordered this book twice now from different companies and both are small.
1,Trash Mask,I purchased this for my son two weeks ago for his birthday. The Mask was very poorly made and had a crack in it when it arrived. They did not even send me the removable face plate. I am sending it back. I have purchased many things from amazon but this is by far the worst purchase I have made.
4,Cute,It was a cute book and certainly relatable. Quick read but amusing at times ans tugs at your heart in certain points.
3,"Entertaining, yet predictable","Sarah Bilston does a fairly good job showing how a pregnant woman must feel like to be on bed rest. Some of the characters seem a little boring, leaving you with a feeling that you really didn't know them. The beginning was slow, but the story line picks up leaving you dying for more. I couldn't wait to see how their marriage was going to work out....."
3,"it was just ""ok""","What is most irritating is that some people who give their opinions on these books for Amazon do not know the difference between ""synopsis"" and ""review"". People listen up! Here's how a ""review"" goes, watch carefully:""""I thought the book was ok, good plot, but the author didn't give me the feeling that she'd ever really been on bedrest for a problem pregnancy. I wouldn't recommend it.""""See how easy it is???? And I never gave away the ending, or gave TMI that would leave one with no reason to read the book, because some ones idea of a ""review"" gave away the entire story."
5,A masterpiece of literary craft,"I agree that ""We Think the World of You"" is brilliant, poignant, subtle, and funny, but would like to make the additional point that it is a stunning example of literary construction. It is widely admired for its construction, but what is not widely acknowledged is that the construction, like its brilliance, poignancy, subtlety, and funniness, is the product of a well trained and accomplished intellect. Ackerley took 12 years to write the book -- he had important ideas he wanted to express as effectively as possible, and the result is a very serious and rewarding novel."
4,Two men and a dog,"Absolute gem of a book set in London just after World War 2.Middle class Frank is visiting his lover, Johnny, as he begins a year in prison. From the start we feel Frank is being used; he ends up helping out Johnny's unpleasant wife and children. As he visits Johnny's parents, he begins to get concerned about his friend's dog, Evie, which has been billetted on them, along with one of the children. The tension in the book as he tries to get custody of the poor animal which is kept inside for weeks at a time and beaten becomes almost unbearable. Although members of the family often utter the refrain 'we think the world of her', Johnny later observes:'She guessed, as I now did, what that world amounted to, and that what he had just done for us...was the most she would ever get, and that she could not count even on that.'A quick read (155 pages) but absolutely unputdownable."
3,Culture and Personality in Melanesia,"One of the classics of the ""Culture & Personality"" school of American anthropology, this book describes the life course of five villages on the island of Alor in modern Indonesia. Readers will be reminded of Margaret Mead's classic _Sex and Temperament_; the nine in-depth ""autobiographies"" of different Alorese provide a useful counterpoint to Mead's more comparative work. Cora du Bois's ethnography is complemented by psychodynamic analyses by Abram Kardiner, and an impressive review of Rorschach tests by a prominent specialist. The book can also be read as an interesting precursor to the larger and later studies carried out by Nancy Schepher-Hughes in Ireland, or by du Bois's student Jean Briggs among Canadian Inuit."
5,Awesome music,"This is a great classic album. Adderley and Evans play very well together. The music is very beautiful and at the same time, very energetic. It is so pleasing that I never tire of listening to the disc. This is one of my favorites out of my 200 item jazz collection. I highly reccommend it."
3,"Good, but lacking.","This was a decent enough read, but it seems like Nyx had a page limit, he hit the limit, and then he stopped the book short. The beggining was filled with detail that brought the main character (who I ended up liking even though I'm tired of the ""strong female warrior"" role) to life, but the end just seemed like an easy out!"
5,"Comfy Shoe, Right Price","I am very pleased with my sneaker purchase. I was looking for a comfy, stylish shoe at a reasonable price that I could use for outdoor activities like picnicking and camping in addition to just wearing around town; this shoe certainly fits the bill! I love the simple, retro look too. I am considering purchasing another pair. I would definitely recommend this shoe. In fact, my boyfriend really likes them and is considering purchasing the men's version."
1,Great Shoes But Poor Fit,"I own a pair of pink Saucony Cambridge Originals and was so pleased with them that I wanted another pair, unfortunately I couldn't find any on Amazon so I decided to go with another shoe from the Saucony brand. I ordered the same size I had gotten before but these shoes are almost a whole size bigger. Very disappointing, I sent them back and will go back to looking for some Cambridge Originals."
4,Great shoe,Ordered this shoe as a gift for my sister...she loves it. Says its comfortable and goes with anything. Definitely recommend this shoe to those who want just an everyday type shoe :)
2,Mediocre,"This shoe is not uncomfortable for any means. However, it is not particularly comfortable either and certainly does not provide the support needed for walking, jogging or running. I ordered yellow/navy and was very happy with the color. The quality was fine for the price, but the shoe seems to run wide. No matter how tight I tie the laces, my heel slides around. These are going back."
2,Instrumentals Non-essential,"With Trojan Records, you'd think you'd pretty much be in the arms of Jah with anything you buy. Not necessarily so, here. Although this collection contains some decent standouts from the Harry J All Stars et. al, most of the material borders on kitsch and comes off as somewhat dispensable within just the first listen, unlike much of the instrumental/dub work of Lee Scratch/Upsetters. Unless you're dedicated to collecting all these box sets, go with another and you might get a few of the better selections offered here."
4,Very excited about this release,"Even though I am very late getting this CD, I am enjoying almost every minute of it. If you were a fan of Billy Squier as I was, you already knew that Alan had talent. I believe I developed a love of the piano/keys in the rock genre while listening to Billy's songs. It is also quite evident why Alan was the perfect choice to sing backing vocals for Billy. Which is not to say that he is strictly a background singer. This CD proves once and for all that he has the talent and the chops to carry any lead vocal. His own vocal arrangements, especially on Fire Island is a real treat.Love is the Word, Kick, Bitch Called Jealousy & Fire Island are catchy tunes that started me singing along quickly. It's a nice, feel good CD.I hope that this is not the last we hear from him."
4,Age fo Heroes,It was an intertaining movie. Acting was good. The overall plot was good and as a British War film I enjoyed Sean Bean.
2,A Curmudgeon Review,"I watch all Sean Bean movies that I can find.This movietakes place at a snowy farm, for the most part.The acting was fine and the camera work was fine,and the story was O.K. if you don't mind a very shortstory. Nazi's are the bad guys and the British arethe good guys in this WW2 movie.I expected more. This movie surprised me as being awell done extemely low budget film or a big budgetfilm where someone stole the money and went to the bank.When the credits rolled at the end of the film, I wonderedif the people shown were paid anything. I felt cheatedto have spent a few bucks to rent it, just say'en."
5,My daughter loves this doll.,My daughter received this doll for her 4th birthday and she loves it. Cinderella goes everywhere with us. My 3 1/2 year old niece likes it so much that I'm getting her the Belle doll for Christmas.
1,DO NOT BUY!,"This toy stinks i bought one, and it didn't even work.I tried listening right by the door.Well you see I was trying to see if it was worth the money.So I told my mom and dad to whisper something.IT DID NOT WORK!"
3,LOST INTEREST FAST,My daughter played with this for 10 minutes and never played with it again.She is nine years old.
4,tess of the d' Urbervilles,it is about a young girl who had her troubled times in life trying to find romance. she has moved to different places to find happeness.
3,Horribly Depressing,"That said, this is still a neat film with great acting. But seriously, I could never watch it again. I just prefer happier storylines and happy endings. Buy something Jane Austen."
3,A&E vs. BBC,"I love the story of Tess and so though I owned the BBC version I still ordered the A&E; version to compare. While A&E; is good, it is not nearly as detailed as BBC. Plus in the BBC version the acting and filming is better, or so I feel. One thing that stood out the most to me was that with BBC you have no doubt about their love for one another at the end of the movie, where as with A&E; the love is less felt and more of a stated fact, you can see them acting out feeling in love but you yourself never feel any real connection between the marraige.A&E; tells us the story of Tess, BBC makes us relate and feel it.Just trying to be helpful for anyone debating between which version to order."
2,compared to the other one,"Tess of the d'Urbervilles starred by Nastassia Kinski and directed by Roman Polanski was my favorite film. I'm so sorry to see that you have no room for that one on this website! Even though this one is good, that one would always be better in my heart. I wish it would be sold and kept like a classic."
4,Great movie!,"The first time I saw Tess was when I caught it on A&E and I immediately became engrossed with the love story. To me, Tess is one of the greatest heriones in all literature and I was pleased to see a film version of an old classic portrayed so elegantly. If you are looking for an enjoyable movie, I sincerely recommend Tess."
5,Tess of the D'Urbivilles,"Although used, this DVD was in excellent condition. It arrived in a timely manner and the move stayed very close to the Thomas Hardy novel. Most enjoyable. I could watch it again and again"
4,Much better than Polanski's version,"At least it's more amusing.In Polanski's version, when Tess rides with Alec to The Slopes, I don't really know why Tess gets angry. But in this version, I get it, bcoz it shows how Alec rides the carriage recklessly. Sorry, Tess, but I found it was too amusing.:P Also, the whistling lesson from Alec is quite interesting too.And this version is much more faithful to the novel. It shows the conversion of Alec from a dandy to a preacher. Another amusing moment!:P Unlike Polanski's version, reintroducing Alec by stating that Tess' mother writes to him. If Tess' mother was willing to wrote Alec a letter after Angel abandoned Tess, why didn't she write to Alec when she knew Tess was pregnant? Polanski's Tess is quite unbelivable.Finally, the acting of Ms. Waddell is amazing! I really get bored by Polanski' Tess. I watched Polanski's version in class, but I slept and missed some parts, and I got this version later.This mini movie rocks!"
3,could have been better,"while the playing on this cd is excellent, the lead singer seemed not to have a seriousattitude about it. ""no time"" alone, is worth the price of the cd."
3,This is a review of the 1.99 Neeland Media LLC edition for Kindle,"I looked at the sample, comparing this version to other Kindle versions. There are better paragraph breaks in this one, making it easier on the eyes. However, it doesn't have the active table of contents. If I am paying for a public domain book on Kindle, I expect an active TOC at least. I can download a free version just as good if I don't want the active TOC.Also, if there are actually any Wyeth illustrations in this book, I'd be surprised. They aren't in the sample."
5,Assimilate French Effortlessly,"Assimil programs are based on effortless assimilation of the language material. I believe that Assimil programs are most popular language learning programs in Europe.From the very beginning you are immersed in the language. The program contains 113 lessons on 608 pages. You can also get 4 CDs with a little bit over 3 hours of entire French material from this book.The book is based on a logical but original approach. It combines a functional and varied vocabulary with sufficient grammar to enable you to master conversational French in just a few months.Each lesson contains of short dialogues and is accompanied by any notes and grammatical explations, which are also reviewed later on. Throughout the book are interspersed cartoons and jokes making learning of French even more enjoyable and fun.After you have completed New French With Ease (I recommend both book and tapes / CDs), you can proceed to the next level ""Using French""."
5,Anthrology of Poetic Forms,Contains brief explanations of poetic forms. It's very good at two things. It explains what is unique about the form type and gives details on its rhyming scheme. Other similar books are Rhyme's Reason and How to be Well-Versed.
4,great service,"I love my intake system, works great. Problem was when it arrived it had the entirely wrong filter for the intake. I had to go to Autozone and buy the right one for $50. Luckily i called K&N and they told me to send back the wrong filter with the reciept for the new one so they could mail me a check for the whole price of the new filter."
2,Surprisingly Negative,It's almost like the author wants to discourage the reader from moving to France. It's also clear that she doesn't believe in the ideals or objectives of a left wing or popular approach to government. Not recommended unless you secretly want to talk yourself out of moving.
5,One of my best Investments,"In several ways I think that (we) marketing people and advertising people in particular are conservative people. Or maybe I should say not very open to change, not very open to adjust, not very open to listen. It's more inside-out than outside-in. Therefore I think that ""(Re)inventing the brand - the new realities of branding"" is a MUST for everybody working in or with the advertising industry. It requires, however, an open mind and willingness to reconsider traditional thinking and practice. The book is like a good novel - hard to put away before the last page. And I think the one chapter ""Energize the value chain of your brand"" in itself makes the book one I my best investments.Egil Braathe, MBAPartner & Advisor; Movement Research & Consulting"
1,Beware - HFCS,"I went to their site where they say these cherries are sweetened with sugar. The packages we got were sweetened, not with sugar, but with High Fructose Corn Syrup. Said so right on the package. Wouldn't have bought them if I'd known that. HFCS is so bad for you even famous soft drink manufacturers are replacing it with sugar.Misleading descriptions are a poor showing by these folks."
3,love it but disappointed,"My daughters both love this doll. They want Santa to bring another one. Unfortunately, my problem is with her hair. Her hair became matted with only a few hours of play. If we try to use the comb that came with it then the hair comes out. I would be sure Santa brought another one if the hair were different."
3,Works OK,"It works squirt free as advertised, but doesn't really save time with the ""double blade"" end. It takes a while to align the section skin between the blades consistently."
2,Double bladed side over rated,"It's a dual sided grapefruit knife. The bended side works as expected, but the dual bladed side gets pulp stuck in it. I wish I had bought a regular grapefruit knife instead. On top of that being left handed, I touch the dual bladed side while cutting with the rounded side."
3,Biased But Still Useful Biography,"Richard S. Van Wagoner's subtitle ""A Portrait of Religious Excess"" should immediately tell you the direction in which he's taking this book. Van Wagoner's goal is to justify the ill-treatment Rigdon has received at the hands of LDS Church historians, so he presents Rigdon as unstable and incapable of succeeding Joseph Smith, which in turn provides the justification for Brigham Young's questionable rise to power. In truth, Rigdon, as Smith's First Counselor, held the strongest claim to presidential succession, and his ouster from the church can only be justified through prevarication.Still, that being said, Van Wagoner's book is still a useful and interesting source on early Mormon Church history. It doesn't succeed in supplanting F. Mark McKiernan's 1971 ""The Voice of One Crying in the Wilderness"" as the definitive biography of Sidney Rigdon, but it is still a useful supplement."
5,Thanks,"You can't beat the quality of Minnetonka moccasins! They are comfortable and last forever, the wife loves these moccasins,thanks!"
2,would not buy again,I am overweight and these slippers do not offer any support. I had trouble after many wearings determinining which was the left and right shoe. I thought they were irregulars and wrote the manufacturer twice...they never answered me.
5,Great Mocs!,"Love these mocs. They are very comfortable, though still a little tight on my wide feet. Getting more comfy every day. The best I've worn in a long time. I recommend them, especially for people with wide feet."
3,poorly understood,"This book belongs in the category of art revisionism. Art is based on exchange of ideas among cultures, but claiming Islamic origin to the Italian and European Reneissance is simply misleading. This book plays into the hands of art and history diletantes, who will walk away with the impression that the genious of the Renaissance rests in Baghdad, not in Florence. I recommend it for scholars, who can correctly esteem its value, but not lay readers with a revisionist agenda."
5,Dean Martin DVD,"Fabulous Memory DVD. Dean Martin captured us all way back when....and by watching this DVD again, it brought back good memories. Clear and good picture quality.Bev Cooney"
2,Not the Bebel of today...,"Due to this CD's import status, no retailer I found listed any information on the title. If you are familiar with the Bebel of today (of Towa Tei and Brasil 2 Mil fame), wait until Six Degrees Records releases her solo album in early 2000. Geraldo Pereira plays like bossa nova on Sesame Street, and I don't recommend it -- not even for the camp value."
2,nice package but poor performance,"My daugher received this machine for her 6th birthday. She was so excited to use it but we found that unless she was holding the mic directly on her mouth, you could not hear her sing at all. The volume was all the way up and still it was extremely low. The machine itself is very attractive with the lyrics displayed nicely on the screen but if you can't hear the person singing..what's the point."
2,"Whatever you do, don't put her in the bathtub!",She's not meant to go in the tub and will fill up w/ water. The only way to get the water out is to pull off a leg and empty the doll that way. Extremely hard to get back on! Also her hair is not meant to be combed even though they include a comb w/ this toy. It's made of something that isn't combable.
3,Good for beginners,"That's about it. They (wheels) roll (very) slowly. Probably due to cheap bearings. But I'm not getting the bearings changed or the skateboard returned. I'm a beginner and the slow speed is fine. I had a friend buy a 100$ skateboard the same day and he's also a beginner. Since that day, he's ripped two jeans and broken a finger nail.My only gripe is that I've to push like after every 10-15 feets. And I stay off the road and stay on the pavement coz of the bad roll of the wheels on the road."
5,Great Skateboard,My nephew loved the skateboard and was delivered in a timely manner and to the correct address.
5,Beautiful blues guitar playing!,"This Cd is One of the best cd's I have listened to in a long time.Greg writes blues/rock song's for what ever mood your in, A very Talented Artist,with extreme speed in his playing.It's easy to see that Greg Serrato truly plays from his heart."
1,Beware - you will get a different product,"You will get a product different than advertised.No Mikes, No MIKE JACKS and no remote control which you can see in the Amazon page.Amazon will tell you that Metroline provided the adds and it's their fault. Metroline will tell you that it is Amazon's fault as they put the adds without confirming with Metroline.The product you will be getting is a ""like new"" 500D version. This does not support Mikes or remote control even if you wanted to add them.The 500D I have got from Metroline was in good shape."
4,Interesting commentary on a sacred book,"A group analyzed Cayce's comments on The Revelation to John. They asked Cayce ""to give... an interpreation... explaining the general plan and theme, the significance.... and explanations of the symbols... as will make this book of personal value .... to awaken and develop the inner life""To approach the living God, one must be prepared and go humbly as Uzza found out and Jesus taught in the lesson of the self-righteous Pharisee and the repentant tax collector.Physical, mental and spiritual aspects are discussed. The Revelation, like the rest of the Bible, is best when read continually. Overtime growth takes place.While not the Revelation itself, this may help many better understand it and move more in the way God would have us."
1,Couldn't even get the name right!,"You get an ideal of how poor the scholarship is on this one by the fact that the author, editor, and publisher don't even seem to know it's the book of Revelation, NOT Revelations! Sheeeeesh!"
1,Read the book instead,The book was laugh out loud funny. The movie tried to follow the plot but lost all the funny Dave Barry commentary.
2,Big Trouble --- how appropriate,"Sorry, but this movie is Big Trouble. If you read and loved the book (as I did) you will be sadly disappointed. Rather than waste your hard-earned money on this tripe, get the book and read it again.And, though it is not the fault of the filmmakers, the bit where they sneak a bomb through very lax airport security is no longer funny or farcical, but in poor taste."
2,Wait for it to Come Out on Cable,"This film could have been much better given the material (I have read the book and it was hilarious). I think given a better script Mr. Sonnenfield could have made a much funnier movie. There are some great performances in this film-particularly Stanley Tucci, Dennis Farina (anyone remember Ray Bones?), and Heavy D and Omar Epps as two smooth and cool FBI agents. However, I do not understand the casting of Tim Allen. I will admit I have never been a fan of his, but his performance is terribly flat in this movie. And there is never really chemistry between him and Rene Russo. Overall I would say Big Trouble is an average movie that could have been great."
1,not one of tim allens best films,this was an unexpected loser. His film Joe Somebody was much better. I like tim allen becasue he tells it like is
1,Gap Who??????????,"I guess brother, Gap, to more famous Chuck Mangione, didn't get as much recognition as Chuck. None of his albums on CDNOW.COM have been reviewed. But I mean, none of his albums were that fantastic anyway. Check Out his 1979 A&M release, Dancin' Is MAkin' Love, its horrendous. I don't even think its jazz at all. Just some old jazz pianist trying to emulate some of the disco artists who were popluar at the time. But this is a rather good album. Not because of the appearence of pianist Gap Mangione, but because it is straight ahead. I like contemporary more, but when ever Gap tried to play contemporary, it didn't sound good! At least here, back to his roots, he can't go wrong? !"
2,Beneath a Marble Sky,"This is not well written enough nor a sufficiently compelling story for a book group to spend time on. The language is stilted in an effort to make it sound ""of its time."" Finally, none of the characters were truly likeable."
4,had a hard time putting it down!,"I truly enjoy reading historical events that have been fictionalized. The reader gets to learn some great historical and cultural facts and also gets to enjoy a beautiful love story. This book achieved both masterfully....It's not the ""typical"" romance book between a man and woman but also includes family love, love of one's culture/country, and friendships. I strongly recommend it!"
2,Disappointing,"I love historical fiction, and I was really looking forward to exploring the building of the Taj Mahal and a study of India with a fictitious story as the vehicle. But I soon tired of the romance novel feel of this book and quit reading it about 125 pages into it--something I rarely do. After turning ahead and seeing only more of the same, there was no reason to go on. It was too boring. It had a shallow, superficial feel that was more like a comic book or novel for teens than a serious novel for adults. I had just finished Michener's classic, Caravans, and felt like I was traveling in Afghanistan in 1946. This one had none of that feel. I'll keep looking for something with some substance, depth, and character development about India--maybe Taj will be more satisfying. I am sorely disappointed in this book."
4,An intense read,"This book was chosen as the read of the month for our book club. The book itself is written intelligently, the story is intense, and the amount of research that went into this book is astounding. If you enjoy the learning process along with reading, as well as a shocking and endearing story line, then this book is sure to deliver!The author (John Shors) was kind enough to answer our questions via speakerphone during our recent book club gathering, and because this was something new for us, it made the experience of reading his book all the more enjoyable. If you are in a book club, I highly recommend treating yourself to this rare experience."
4,Good Love Story and a History Lesson too,"My book club is reading ""Beneath a Marble Sky"". I had heard about the book and was interested in reading it. It is a really good story, full of interesting history. I never knew that much about the Taj Mahal. How many people do. This was the author's first book and he did a wonderful job. He says that he took a story that people told in this country and made it into a fiction account about what went on when the Taj Mahal was built. Most people know that it is a Mausoleum built by the ruler of the country to honor his wife, but how many people knew more than this. I certainly did not. I always love books that tell a good story and that you learn something when reading the book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves history and a good story."
4,Beneath A Marble Sky,"I greatly enjoyed reading the history of the building of the Taj Mahal. When one has seen this most beautiful structure in the world, it is rewarding to learn more of the history of the construction. This is historical fiction, and in some parts is a bit too contrived. I am not sure the explicit sex acts were necessary and were a bit off-putting. Whether that was actually the way people behaved, I am not sure.Mary G"
2,An OK Summer Read,"This was just OK for me. I liked the story, but it could've been so much more in the hands of a better writer - it felt like the telling of a story and not story-telling, and you know the difference when you read it. Loved the historical context, but much of the dialogue and writing felt forced and rushed to me. All in all, an OK summer read, but nothing I would recommend whole-heartedly."
1,Terrible writing,The author did not succeed in writing with a woman's voice. And the characters were cardboard and simplistic. It was a lovely idea that didn't come to fruition.
3,It's a story I ultimately didn't care about.,"It is simply an average book. It's a story told in retrospect that is a little tedious. I finished it, but I wasn't moved."
3,"Good songs, but technical problems plague this DVD.","First off, I just want to say that I am a big Poison fan. Buying this video, I thought I knew just what I was getting. However, this is not the case. All of the great videos are included on this DVD, but it is eaten up with technical problems. For about the first half of the DVD, color bars pop in and out of the screen. This is very distracting! Also, the audio is not in sync with the video on several songs with a split second delay. This is also a very anoying problem. This is problably the most technical problems I have ever seen on a DVD and I have seen a bunch of DVDs. If you want this DVD, I would hold off for a while and maybe the problems will be fixed."
5,Still Got Something Inside,"This DVD rules. As many people metioned about this DVD,these are old music videos,some of the video and sound tracks did not match,and all lack of new footage. But check this out, there is a ""POISON WORLD TOUR HIGHLIGHTS 1999-2000"" video clip you might not found in the ""BONUS VIDEOS"". Just use your remote and enter the BONUS VIDEOS menu, then press ""7"",or make the skull highlighted and press enter. You can see there's a four-minute vedio clip of POISON's concert last year. Though it's just a short video clip,but you can see how POISON's back on stage and their live performance is still awesome. This should be qualified as ""new footage"" I guess, and I think it's worth of anything. Hope we can have POISON's concert DVD soon!!!! By the way, if you play this DVD with PC not DVD player, the video and sound synch problem will gone. It's weired,but that's how it works."
1,HealthCare Wet & Dry Nose Hair Trimmer,Totally useless! It arrived with two cracks running the complete length of the outer hosing.Then it didn't do any of the things it had promised!I was significantly disappointed. Select another product.
2,Motokata trimmer,"After reading a number of reviews, I thought that with this trimmer I could do away with the scissors. My experience, though, it that scissors are faster and more efficient. This is the only nose hair trimmer I have tried so I don't know how it compares to others."
5,Chainsaw's Justice,"A very good book that will hold your interest. Also, everything that happened in the book is true and should not have happened to the people involved in this awful situation."
3,Civil War Pistol,"I got this toy for my son's 6th Christmas. I know he will love it when he sees it. I reminded me of one that I had when I was a kid. All the others that I looked at on Amazon.com were plastic, and not worth spending the money on. This one was great."
4,pistol,"it is a little less sturdy than anticipated; however, my son will enjoy. He loves history and especially civil War."
1,Refill mess,If you try to refill it and there is some left in the bottom it gets all over. The refill from the bottom idea was not a good one. It never looks completely full. Once you fill it for the first time and turn it right-side-up you will never be able to turn it upside down to refill without making a mess and getting red dye all over your fingers. There will always be some nectar left in the bottom that the birds can't suck out and it will run out of the little holes once you turn it upside down again.
1,If you have lots of hummingbirds,"Maybe our hummers in Calif. are different from other areas, but here they are to the death ""This is my territory"". I liked the look of this feeder but was very disappointed when it arrived. It is so large there is no way I can use it."
1,....but it makes a good doorstop.,"This book was the required text for my multimedia authoring class because no other Director 6 books were available at the time. It was so poorly laid out that after a few weeks my instructor gave up on teaching with the book. Now that I use Director at work, I've realized that it doesn't even cut it as a reference.Inside Director tries to teach general multimedia rather than the fundamentals of Director. The book attempts to teach you how to create sound and digital movies in other programs(Which has nothing to do with learning Director), yet it severely lacks in explaining how to handle sound and movies in Director. The book also teaches you more about how to write HTML(Which also has nothing to do with learning Director), then how to create streaming shockwave movies with net Lingo.Save your money and buy a different book."
3,Waxed mustashe and all,"MuAgatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Expressis the most recent of these movies that I have seen.Agatha Christie mysteries have become classics and only her last work wasn't great. This movie is part of series of films involving the Belgiandetective. He has always seemed kind of greasy to me?Here wealthy Americans are mingling with the international crowd on a French train, and murder erupts and ignites the scene."
5,I'm a Believer,I did it all naturally . This program is complete .It deals with any issue that might arise. I let go of my fears and relaxed and felt safe .. The new edition is out and available on amazon . Ipreferred the new Cd's .Much higher quality. beautiful actually
1,No returns and not as described,"The book is a great text for PTAs. We are using it a lot in my PTA 101 class. The book is not sprial bound as described from this seller. If you buy from this seller, you won't be able to return anything! They will not answer emails or allow you to return the product. I accidently ended up with two and they would not let me return it even though it was unopened and unused."
1,This purchase was a total waste of my money!,"I keep an immaculate house, and 8 weeks after buying this product I still have a mice problem. The product is ridiculously overpriced, paying the same amount for shipping as the cost for each individual unit. Is this even legal!?? I certainly wouldn't have cared if the product worked, but the LENTEK INTERNATIONAL ULTRASONIC PEST PATROL PR30C simply does not do what the manufacturer claims!"
4,Only one complaint,Photo quality is excellent! Like the 10x zoom. The ability of this camera with its large zoom and 6mp to fit in a shirt pocket is great. My only complaint is the tiny size of the multi-selector. It makes selections unnecessarily difficult.
3,Timothy Zahn at his worst,This is a big let down. The Brolf situation is so boring I haven't read much. but right now I want to return it. When will we get to outbound flight. The Chiss what is happening with them. I reccomend not reading this book.
4,More to come?,"This was a really good book that sort of fizzled at the end. It felt like Zahn was just trying to wrap things up and was in too much of a rush at the end. It left me feeling a little unsatisfied. The first 3/4 of the book are awesome, however. And I would recommend this and ALL of Timothy Zahn's books to anyone interested in the Star Wars extended universe.What I am REALLY curious about is whether there is a plan for more books about Thrawn. I really want to know how he goes from the man in this book to the man in the Thrawn Trilogy. Would the Thrawn of the Thrawn Trilogy have given a damn what people thought about his actions in the final battle? I don't think so. He is, perhaps, the most intriguing character in the Extended Universe, and I really hope Zahn will write more books about him. I know he has some other Star Wars releases on the docket, I hope they incorporate this great character."
3,There are better EU books out there,"I like the Old Republic era books, but this was a bit of a disappointment, just because I thought the Outbound Flight would make it there and have adventures and stuff. Instead it was just politic intrigue and the introduction of Thrawn. Still a worthwhile read, just not what I expected."
4,Good character insight,This novel is a great follow up from the orginal Thrawn series. The reader gets more insight into Thrawn as well as Master C.B. I think the use of Obi Wan and Anakin is well done and the story is full of great Star Wars moments. Recommended!
4,"Line between dark and light, are Jedi moral?","This book describes extreme Jedi Master C'baoth's formation and leadership that led the Outbound Flight to turmoil and eventual destruction after encountering Thrawn and the Chiss. The pacing of this book flows going from character to character, from trader Car'das to Obi-Wan. This book also brings out the moral dilemma of Jedi training, taking children away from their parents and family and forbidding them from having any contact with them. Star Wars fans may argue about how noble the Jedi are, but the author does a good job of questioning their roles and policies, especially with a character who is extreme in nature like C'baoth.The reader does get a good view of Thrawn's first encounter with those from the Old Republic and how the Chiss are organized to fight threats to their worlds.The flow is much better than Survivor's Quest and overall an entertaining book."
4,Good story,I first discovered Timothy Zahn many moons ago when I read Heir to the Empire and the sequels. I've always loved the way he captures the essence of Star Wars in his book. My only issue with this story is the ending seemed unfinished much like empre Strikes Back did back in the day.
1,Piece of crap dont waste your money,Besides doing nothing to improve performance the manufacturer only wanted to fix the unbroken product when I asked for my money back! Dont be fooled this doesn't work and is a waste of money you cant get returned!
2,Dang,"Having owned and been very happy with the two prior Mariza DVD's I was very pleasantly surprised to find that this DVD had been released. Unfortunately, this DVD's audio mastering is the worst quality I have yet had the displeasure of owning. I am a big fan of Mariza and am shocked at how badly this DVD was done. On the plus side Mariza is a wonderful performer as always and her band is great, those things can be seen in the performance.Buy Concerto em Lisboa or Mariza Live in London.. both are far superior to this disaster."
5,Phenomenal!,Great documentary. Thanks to Victor for following in God steps to share his past to reach those most could not.
5,Kevin James King of Queens & King of Comedy,Love King of Queens.excellent show. Can't get any better than Carrie and Dougie..........and without the father involved. Hillarious stuff.
5,Another great thing about the King of Queens boxed sets,"I've left a couple of comments for other KofQ compilations. However, one of the BEST things about all of the boxed sets is they are on only three disks. If you are a diehard KofQ fan as I am, you can have marathon viewings without getting off the couch to change disks. That's the way Doug would do it: sit on the couch for the long ride--snacks within reach. I love Raymond, but 5 discs are too much. They take up a lot of room and you have to get off the sofa to change disks too often. Go for the King--its much funnier than Raymond and more user friendly."
1,LOOK FOR CLIPPERS FROM Petsmart,"I got two pair of these clippers and both could not even cut paper, My short hair dog could not stand a chance of being cut best to not buy these go to petsmart spend the extra money at least they will work."
4,Therese Raquin,This is very interesting and different. The story moves at a good pace and it is worth reading. I will probably purchase other stories by Emile Zola
4,older hard back but in good condition,"In fact the book was a First Edition that was one time a Library book somewhere. It would be interesting to know how many folks had read it. From the bit of wear and tear I would say it had been enjoyed by many. It was kind of like reading a history of about 300 years and like many of CJ Cherryh books it leaves you wonder - OK What happen nexted.After I got the book I realize I had read it before but like a good movie, I enjoyed it again. Guard"
5,"a ""must-have"" guide to vegetarian cookery","I first learned of Laurel's Kitchen in the mid-1970s when my parents gave my sister Laurel a copy for Christmas. Being an artist, I really admired the woodcut illustrations. However, I didn't start to use the book religiously until 1978, when I and all my grad-school friends decided to pursue a vegetarian life style. My copy, which I bought at the food coop where I volunteered is now in pieces, but I still use it regularly. I can count on the book to contain information about vegetables I'm not familiar with, and how best to prepare them, plus providing clear instructions for making such things as yogurt and sushi nori. Though no longer a strict vegetarian, having a husband and two children who like meat far too much to give it up just yet,I eat meatless meals at least several times a week. The recipe for Sultana's Spanakopita (a real winner!) has inspired a family favorite: broccoli pie, in which we've substituted broccoli for spinach."
4,The New Laurel's Kitchen,"One question, and I would like Laurel herself or one of her associates to answer (if possible). How is your vegitarian dog? Would you still recommend a vegitarian lifestyle for pets? This is the only thing that threw me off about the book. Otherwise, the advice and recipits are invaluable."
2,I couldn't use it,"I ordered this microphone for my son for Christmas. It was not until we tried to use it did we realize it is for Karaoke machines only. It did not say that in the description. Therefore, it was no use to us."
1,"Dissapointment, very poorly made","1) Batteries last about three weeks. that is 15 sets of five alkaline batteries a year. IE about $45 in batteries to run this clock for a year. so it isn't an $18 clock it is a $63 clock...or probably the most expensive alrm clock you ever bought.The voice feature is the worst of any voice simulation I ever heard. You simply cannot understand it.The clock turns off when the radio is on. Great can't see what time it is if you have it set to radio as alarm!On might have expected such poor design if this had been another ""character-based"" merchandise, but it isn't, making the irnony of its junkyness even worse."
3,Interesting & hot,"Biographer Gavin introduces workaholic Lori to the mystery and eroticism of her heritage. Travel, sex, and a buried mystery are at the core of this Black Lace book. It is hot, but keeps up good characterization and plot. It has all the usual BL scenes, with an emphasis on Lori's bondage and domination. Pretty light on that, though. If you like this, try Portia Da Costa's Continuum."
3,"Fusion, not fission","I love Hiroshima's Eastern-Western fusion style. This was the first CD of Hiroshima's I'd listened to; it didn't take me very long to fall in love with the group. I give this 3 stars mainly in praise of my favorite track (One Wish). The rest of the CD is certainly enjoyable but mediocre in comparison, I think. This is not Hiroshima's finest release, but rather a great introduction."
2,Not great for telecommuting,"I telecommute and I've been looking for a headset compatible speakerphone that would work well in my environment. I needed a speakerphone capable of full-duplex operation to make it possible to barge into conference calls. I bought the Soundpoint Pro, but I'm somewhat disappointed for the following reasons:- volume range on speakerphone is too limited (I have to use a headset to ""tune in"" quiet speakers).- the speed dial mechanism is cumbersome - scroll through a list and then press ""speed dial"" rather than pressing a programmed button.- the sound quality is rather bassy- the number sequence programming is too short. I can't program enough digits to get one button access to voice mail (need 25 digits including pauses)- no ""new call"" light- no display light- not enough lines in CID displayI'll probably return it."
2,Needs more volume,"I have one. The only reason why I am looking for a different phone now is because the volume is too low. Just like some of the other reviewers, I have the control on 5 (highest) and I still need more volume."
5,"works awesome on the the pets, no bug bites from things that cause heart worm, and flys stay away from them also....awesome","Since our 11 AND 5 YEAR OLDS HAVE BEEN ON THIS WE HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH FLYS BITTING THERE EARS, NIGHT FLYING BUGS THAT CAUSE HEARTWORM...THE BUGS STAY AWAY. WE HAD LEFT THE OLDER 3 DOGS WITH A FRIEND AND HIS DOGS EARS WEREE BLEEDING AND OUR DOGS JUST FINE......AWESOME PRODUCT..HIGHLY RECOMEND IT. WE PUT IT ON THE DRY KIBBLE, AND WITH 3 WE HAVE 2 CANS MIXED UP AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM. dON'T KNOW IF THEY WORK ON TICKS THOUGH. WE HAVEN'T HAD A PROBLEM BUT WERE ARE IN THE CITY. HOPE THIS HELPS"
5,Review,"It looked crisp clean, arrived early.Very good quality!!!!!!! I am very happy with the manual because it has even problems solved but Doesn't have all the odd problems as I expected."
5,Best kept secret in jazz,Laura Theodore is long overdue for a major hit and this might be it. I have been following this incredible singer's career since the 1980s. She always ignites a song and mesmerizes a listener. Get the CD and tell your friends. It is time--what the world needs now is more Laura Theodore.
1,Better than a sharp stick in the eye...but not by much!,"This is the best film of a sorry lot of L & H films made in the '40's. And the sorry isn't just Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's creativity being confined by the large movie studios, in this case 20th Century Fox. Stan looks old and tired. Ollie is no longer just a big guy, he is sloppily fat. Contrary to the prevailing Laurel and Hardy fan clubs party line this film (and the other '40's films) isn't just bad because of the nasty movie moguls imposing rigorous constraints on the boys; it' also bad because-sad to say-the boys are just going through the motions. It's easy to say that they should have quit instead of embarassing themselves but apparently the income was needed; I wish they had saved their money and had quit while on top."
3,Not quite new,"The book I ordered was advertised as new, but it was obviously not in new condition. I can't complain too much because the price was very good, and the book arrived very quickly. I just thought it looked slightly used."
1,King scares me for the wrong reasons,"Stephen King used to be a master at the macbre, but now he seems to be a master at insanity and perversion."
4,Mainly Very Good,"I found most of the stories quite good. The first one, in particular, had me rivetted."
1,A total disappointment,"This is a great idea! Too bad this item doesn't work the way it is supposed to. If you put more than 2 bills in, it'll jam. It's not accurate in counting money when you deposit, and it doesn't deduct when you withdraw. This is the second Room Gear item that we purchased and both will be returned."
2,Not Very Durable,"Save your money on this one. Our first one broke, we got a replacement from the manufacturer, and the second one quit working after a while, too. This is not a very well constructed toy, and I don't think the kids using it were very hard on it."
1,Doesn't Work,"Brand new out of the box, the calculator makes subtraction errors (amazing in the 21st century!). Coins got jammed within 5 minutes in the sorter. The money holder doesn't lock properly. Its educational value might be how a great concept can be totally ruined in manufacturing."
1,Downgrading the Sages of Israel!,"Out of the author's very limited imagination, comes a fictionalized account of the great sages of the Talmud,placed within a mundane, banal, and totally ""turned off"" mentality and spirituality. The great sages are unlikeable and close minded, weak and slightly retarded. A waste of time to read this book,(wish I could erase the impression from my mind), and it is not suitable for teenagers or adults. Avoid this book. Even the literary style(style?) does not justify it being written."
5,wow!!!!,"JUST ONE WORD...WOW!!!WHERE DID THIS GUY COME FROM...HE IS INCREDIBLE, AND THIS ALBUM IS EXCELLENT. ""SEA OF PURITY"" IS A GOOD SONG, BUT I WOULD HAVE NEVER EXPECTED THIS ALBUM TO BE THIS GOOD BASED ON THAT SINGLE.THE VOCALS ARE VERY GOOD. VERY STRONG AND PASSIONATE, AND VERY CRISP AND CLEAR AT THE SAME TIME. ALONG THE LINES OF DE/VISION AND IRIS (THE LAST ALBUM). THERE ARE TOO MANY GREAT SONGS HERE TO SINGLE OUT. MOST OF THEM ARE MIDTEMPO AND THEN BUILD INTO AN AWESOME CLIMAX. AND THE LYRICS ARE VERY INTIMATE AND PERSONAL WITHOUT BEING SAPPY. A LOT OF SONGS HERE (LYRIC WISE) WE CAN ALL RELATE TOO. I KNOW I CAN. AND THE WAY THEY ARE SUNG MAKES THEM EVEN MORE BELEIVABLE. ALL AROUND GREAT PERFORMER, GREAT CD. MY HAT COMES OFF, ONCE AGAIN, TO TODD FROM DIFFERENT DRUM FOR PICKING THIS ARTIST FOR HIS LABEL. DONT MISS OUT ON THIS ONE. PICK THIS CD UP!!!"
1,Don't you believe it for a second!,"5-star reviews for this? You've got to be kidding. This is one of the most banal, dull and trite albums I've ever had the misfortune of reviewing. While its creator has a firm grasp of his equipment and knows how to make the sounds he wants, his ability to write songs is severely lacking. The music all sits still residing at the same level and in the same key, pitch, emotion or whatever... nothing separates itself. The entire album is one giant non-descript waste of time. The lyrics may be the worst I've heard all year and I've had to review some stinkers. He tells his beloved to ""dry your eyes"" in at least 3 different songs... no joke! It's filled with cliches about ""rising suns"" and ""new days dawning"" and of course ""drying your eyes"". You never heard poetry this bad in junior high love letters.What a waste! These synthpop people are really starting to settle for less and it's sad."
3,Works as specified,"Just bought this adapter. It works for the most part, you can use it to power a case fan via a 3-pin connector if the fan only has a Molex connector. However, I didn't pay enough attention to the photo. There's no yellow wire going to the 3-pin connector, so it can't be used to connect to a motherboard and monitor fan speed, which is why I bought it. No sense in returning it though; shipping costs more than the adapter, and it only cost a few bucks. Oh well, my mistake - I'll have to pay more attention next time."
3,"The Product is Fine, But the Vendor Needs Help","I ordered two of these, but the vendor sent me two of the wrong part. (I needed female 3-pin connectors and they sent 3-pin male connectors). I contacted the vendor, they were very helpful and promised to send the correct part. Well, they did, but they only sent one (I needed two). Since it's something I could get locally at fairly low cost, I bought the other one that way."
5,Terrova Trolling Motor Remote,I used them in my Minn Kota Terrova Trolling Motor remote. They work great. There is a difference between the CR2450N and the CR2450 so make sure you get the one that will fit your device. The Terrova remote needs the one with the N on it. The remote only needs one battery so I bought an extra one for a spare. Good batteries!
3,Surprised/disappointed with poor quality of pictures,"I take a LOT of pictures of my 9 grandchildren and when I needed a new 35mm camera, this seemed ideal. However, I have been very disappointed with this camera's performance.Outdoor pictures with no flash come out very well, but any photo requiring a flash does not. The center of the photo has some brightness to it, with the outside of the picture almost fading to black.I have now gone to almost 100% digital shots."
5,Best Online purchase,I am a Amarige fan and I could not resist this excellent price which I could not bet in any local store where I live. The scent is excellent and the lotion concentration is of a good quality and consistency. I would high recommend this product for 'the mature' woman as it is very sophisticated and yet elegant scent. The brand is excellent as I now would like to add other products suck as the eau de toilette and shower gel
5,Most Beautiful Bible Story Book!,"When I was 3 years old my Grandma and Grandpa gave me this Bible story book. I loved it for years, and years. Eventually it disappeared. I found the original a couple of years ago -worn and beat up. BUT... Now thanks to the internet and Amazon, I was able to get a used one in very good condition for quite a good price.This book sports the best painting and drawings of any Bible Story book I have ever seen, everyone that see's it agrees.I will say that I've ordered 3 so far (as gifts etc.) and only 1 has been the correct title. There is another ""Best Loved Bible Stories"" book out there, and it is so much lower quality. Buyer beware. And I will also say that all the sellers should make sure that the used book they sell is actually the ""Best Loved Bible Stories"" By DAVE & NETA JACKSON... Published by Chariot Books.This truly is a beautiful Bible Story book. Mine is going to be passed to my children some day -Lord willing."
3,Worth Renting/Buying,"Over the weekend, I rented and watched Motives 2. It was a good sequel to the first movie. I would recommend it."
3,Sterling Charm Bracelet,"The bracelet is good quality but I would have liked to know the length of the chain. It is quite short. It would fit a small child, although, when my children were small enough to wear this bracelet, it would have ended up in thir mouths. It's cute but too small for an adult."
4,Informative,"It starts with storytellers telling the tales of life of the Buddha and then goes into historical facts. Venturing into what life might have been like in that time period. Asking the question, was Siddharta reared in Shaman or other religious practices of the time? This biographical accounting of the Buddha was informative.Makes me want to go to India and sit on Vultures Peek to meditate. I have watched it over and over."
1,Seriously outdated,"With all the new anchors and ancillary equipment now available, a more up to date selection would be more useful. [...]. A very readable book that may inspire you to venture out and will certainly amuse you with stories of what you might find when you do. Loads of practical advice and reports of independent gear tests. Probably the only book of its kind that devotes a whole chapter to Anchoring Etiquette.Happy hooking!"
5,inspirational,"I was given this book in college by my coach, after 25 yrs it still brings me back to the true meaning of sport and gets me in touch with my soul. My 16 yr old daughter has confiscated it from me, and I hope that it is as meaningful for her (she is a long distance runner) as it was for me."
1,Out of date,This was a Christmas gift for my husband and he said it was old information so the book went back.
3,General Reference Gun Book,"Not knowing anything about guns before I bought this book, it gave me a basic idea of gun values & history. Pictures to go along with the descriptions would have been extremely helpful! For anyone who is ready to sell their guns, I highly recommend that you go on the internet, search for your guns, then compare prices. Sometimes, the values in this book, and those on the internet show a difference depending on the gun. You definitely want to get more BANG for your gun. I would recommend it for general gun reference. This book is sold here, on Amazon.com for alot less than buying it at your local sporting goods store. Also, I didn't have to wait a few weeks before their next shipment arrived. It was in stock, I got it right away and I saved $$ purchasing it here. Even with shipping!"
4,"Blue Book of Gun Values, 27th Ed.",I have an earlier edition and it was a useful tool when pricing firearms to buy or sell. Use this book as a good litmus check for firearm pricing.
5,Bought for someone else,"I'm sorry, but I bought this for someone else to give as a gift to her husband. Therefore, I can't offer a review."
3,ok,pros: looks bosscons: hands do not light up very well at nightdate does not stay correct for some reason
2,Don't buy it,"Very poor display, really hard to read. Bought as a gift, recipient couldn't use it because of the lousy display.It's not much more than a marketing scam; a virtually unusable product so get money for, which technically does the job as claimed (so it's not an outright fraud) but in essence it's useless Chinese trash - as most of the Chinese products have become (in case you haven't noticed)."
2,The Frog Princess,"Well, this was your typical fairy tale,a spin-off of the frog prince. Princess meets Prince, there's a magic kiss, some great adventure, and magic saves the day(of course). I really didn't like this book. It was badly written and had an ending that didn't really tell you the full story. Sometimes the Prince sounded like he was trying to rape the Princess! Whatever."
1,Unsettling...,"SPOILERS!I read the other reviews and I have to disagree with most of them. I found the book hard to stomach. There was a huge age difference between the characters which threw me off, but I can look past that if the story is good. Then her transformation in so short a time, it was less than a month and the governess had changed her into a lady. Then, within the first month he tries to loosen up her up with some alcohol and make a play for her. Yet, after the governess leaves and he starts teaching her he doesn't try anything for 6 months, then he gets hammered and rapes her. I found the sex scenes disturbing as they seemed to border on rape rather than love - sure she became willing, but it came across to me as a young girl enthralled with a father figure rather than love. Sebastian was a cold unfeeling brute through most of the book and I just couldn't sympathize with his character. I usually love Karen Robards, but this is the first book of hers that I couldn't stomach."
2,Below the author's usual standard.,"Compared to Karen Robard's best work, like the wonderful ONE SUMMER, this book is disappointing. Mainly because of the insufferable hero and his cruel and violent treatment of the heroine and everybody else, - all of which is forgiven for no apparent reason - the whole thing appears rather contrieved and dated. AMANDA ROSE is even worse, by the way"
5,An Interesting Book on an Aspect of Particle Physics,When I saw a copy of this book I was immediately pleased with its appearance and organization. My interest was fully primed so I purchased the book and began to read. I discovered that the book was very pleasant and easy to read. The new organizing principle set forth in the book provides a beautiful and convincing flow of relationships which carry the reader to the conclusion that a very acceptable explanation has been given for the existance of three quark-lepton families.
2,I didn't like it,It is not what it says.didnt work both microphones same time. So complicated. I will never recommend to any body
5,Great!,"This wireless system is great. I had to invest a little more but I do not regret it. The product is absolutely fantastic, easy to install and very efficient."
1,Flimsy but cute,"This was very easy to put together unlike some of the PlayHut's tents but it is extremely flimsy, there is no bottom piece that you can weigh down with a playmat, so sometimes my daughter moves the entire tent or knocks it down. I don't recommend this particular tent. There are other Dora tents that are much much better."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this for my child's outdoor birthday party. It is unstable. It falls over when kids play inside. It is too hot, air does not circulate inside. The three short horizontal poles which you insert to give it structure warped when it was outside in the garden. It's hot here but no excuse for such poor quality. I am plannng to give it away. Maybe someone can find a use for it."
2,Dora Hideway,I would not recommend this toy to anybody. My daughter loves Dora so that's why I got it for her but it's not very durable at all. The least little pressure on the bottom edges and it just bends in that direction. She's had it for a couple weeks now and it won't even stand up by itself anymore. It is not worth the money.
1,Only The Title Is Good,"What a disappointment. What a waste of money. The title sounds good, there is the promise of going along in the cockpit of a heavy jet around the world -- but this book is mostly a waste of time. The grammar, the organization, the presentation, the jumping from one unrelated topic to another, the introduction of characters and situations that then are never heard of again are all annoying and distracting. And it all ends with weird TWA 800 missile conspiracy stuff. Er what?This is really just another personal website that would be OK reading for free, but is not deserving of a place on a bookshelf. Keshner never really talks about the actual flying, and while there are some sorta neat stories in the book, and I'd love to hear them at an airport bar, I was left feeling cheated out of my money. I'd pass on this book, and move on to great flying books by Gann, Bach, Drury, Morgan and many more.Read all the reviews, not just the 'best book ever' ones from 'a reader'"
1,Don't buy this book,"Tasteless and juvenile. Soft teenage porn. I wouldn't recommend wasting either your time or money in reading or purchasing this book. On the other hand if books on sleeping with flight attendants or numerous references (explicitly) to ""pussy"" excite you, this might be the book for you. I am a college educated Air Traffic Controller and was disturbed by the STROIES and graphic descriptions made up in this book."
1,Not any more helpful than my guidebook,"I really wanted to like this book as my favorite part of traveling is eating, but I honestly did not find it helpful at all. It's advertised to help you with market foods, but there are no pictures. I had Rick Steves' Istanbul guidebook with me, and I found his description of Turkish food, food phrases, and eating habits more helpful than this book."
1,Over priced firewood.,"The initial first impression was good, dense and heavy, feels good in your hands. But to my surprise after a few test swings, a light swing on the grass to test it's durability caused it snap in half. Unacceptable, a real bokken can resist far worst pressure and come out with only a scatch. The item was refunded, but there are better options if you are searching for a suburito."
4,Hardwood Suburito,"It came very quickly and securely wrapped.It doesn't seem to have been damaged in transit although there are a few knots in the wood, though they are very minor. It doesn't matter to me anyway since I'm only using this one for swinging, not actual contact.It actually weighs about the same as my bokken despite being over 4 inches longer and considerably thicker. Then again, my bokken is very expensive and very strong. Its lacquer is alright, although I'm trying to find a way to make the handle less slippery when I begin to sweat. Overall, not a bad buy, but it could be a pound or so heavier. It's too light for me but still gives a decent workout."
4,Fine Hardwood Suburito,It is a nice piece of wood. A little in color then expected and the handle's a little smaller.
5,satisfied customer,"The book arrived in good condition and on time. It covered a large segment of what some of us refer to as junk and some of us call a ""find"". I think it's great that the idea of reusing and recycling items is a popular and growing idea. I love the idea of finding that one of a kind item at a flea market or antique store that adds a perfect touch of your own personality to a living space. This book can inspire a person to go looking for that perfect piece of American Junk."
5,A great book for anyone wanting to become familiar with clicker training or brush up on techniques!,This is a fantastic book going over all aspects of clicker training. Morgon Spector writes clearly and provides such great visuals in his descriptions. He provides reasons for doing things rather than just expecting someone to follow blindly. This book has been a great tool in my transformation as a dog owner and trainer.
2,"Basic needs met, but flawed design...","I find that the iConcepts Deluxe case, while of good quality, fits the iPaq relativly poorly, offering little protection from both elements and impact. I was also displeased in finding out that when the iPaq was equiped with the PCMCIA expansion pack, it would not (easily) fit into the case. Additionally, there is a leather flap with velcro to secure the device from the top. This means if you have a Compact Flash or PCMCIA device that excedes the height of the iPaq, this flap will prove to be nothing but an inconvenience. Alternativly, if you are not using an expansion pack, you might as well surgically remove the flap as it blocks nearly all of the infrared port.On the whole, it provides modest protection, albeit most for the screen, but leaves much to be desired. Also the additional slots are few and not diverse enough for anything other than credit cards or business cards."
5,Re: Book Maven's review,"Bravo the ""wordy stuff!"" What the hell are we reading fiction for? To get to the essence? I love words! I'm going to buy this book just on the ""words"" of someone I don't even know! D.H Lawrence. Thomas Hardy. WORDS! I could jump out of my skin just arguing the point. Lose me in the words, tease me with your description and let's get lost! Ain'a or no?"
1,What Happened?,"This novel baffles me. Dreiser is capable of so much more - read Sister Carrie for instance, written around 1900 but still capable of transfixing the reader today with one of the first (unpoliticized) portrayals of a woman transformed from suffering victim to survivor and victor.But while Sister Carrie shattered cliches which hadn't even been recognized yet, An American Tragedy is a long book that reads very much like an extended cliche."
3,Maybe I've Seen the Film Too Often!,"Loved the film with Monty Cliff, Liz Taylor and Shelly Winters so very much thought I'd enjoy reading the original. Found Dreiser's writing ploding, dated and difficult to follow. Character development was slow and shallow. Film writers did a fabulous job making such a remarkable landmark film based on this writing. Sorry, watch the movie!"
1,Damaged picture tube on delivery,"Damaged picture tube on deliveryWe have recently received a SHARP 30F630 from Amazon.com. We accepted TV delivery as the units looked intact and powered up without any problems. After connecting the TV to a DVD source, the tube however showed some discoloration in corners and along the edges. Initially I assumed that the problem would be easily corrected either by tuning the unit or by a small adjustment by SHARP technician. It is not the case, however, as now we were informed that the TV tube is damaged and need to be replaced. Amazon does not accept returns on TVs of this size, and SHARP is not eager to replace the tube under standard warranty.I would not recommend purchasing any TV unit from Amazon which is not covered by a return policy. Just as us, you might purchase a defective unit and have no recourse to fix it."
1,Did I read the same book?,"I anxiously anticipated this book because I appreciate Caravaggio's art and hoped that this book was similar to the Red Violin. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment. As I read chapter after chapter, I kept waiting for it to get better. When I finished the book I could not believe that I wasted so much time on it. I must own a different book from that read by the other reviewers.Save your money and time."
3,If you have a love for art history you will probably like it,"I read this for a book club without realizing that it was non-fiction. I thought it was historical fiction until I finished it and was reading the acknowledgments. Now that I understand that, I do appreciate it more. I think the author did a good job, I was just waiting for a bit more excitement which a good novel would have provided.I also think this would appeal to art majors and those with a real interest in the art world - I never even heard of Carravaggio prior to this book."
5,Surprised and delighted with this book,"I bought this book based upon the liner notes, not having any real interest in classical art. However, I was soon caught up in the mystery and the chase, as if this were a work of fiction. In reality, this is an excellent book and the author keeps the pages turning to the satisfying conclusion, as I read this book in one sitting. My compliments to the author."
5,7 Gothic Tales,"The book was an excellent one written by the author of ""Out of Africa"" in her earlier years. While it is obvious that the author was not as experienced as she became it was still a good read.It was delevered on time and in condition as advertised."
1,Negative effects!,This product actually gave me a panic attack instead of helping my anxiety. I felt worse and had a horrible day for about 12 hours. DO NOT TAKE KAVA.
2,Lot's of fun but don't expect it to last long,"I bought this for my daughter. She loves to play with it. But we were disappointed by a couple of things. As we started to brush their hair- wads of hair came out. It tangles easily and is hard to manage but she still enjoys it. Also her other disappointment was the hair color. Although it comes in more than one color, you can't tell the difference between them in the hair. Really, it barely even shimmers."
1,Horrible Book - Dont waste your time or money,"I am an architect and certified Feng Shui specialist. This book is horrible. It recklessly confuses true Feng Shui with superstition. Please, using bagua mirrors to shield away the bad feng shui? Are you kidding me? The author even calls them pa-kua mirrors... This is the worst rendition of a feng shui book I have ever read. Give me a break, the author's other books are on ""psychic subjects"".Dont waste your money on this trash."
1,webster is capitalizing off eastern beliefs,"this book was a joke. the only thing webster clearly showed was that he knows how to make money off of other's ideas and beliefs. this book could have easily been condensed into a list of 101 lines, rather than a whole book- as all webster did was take the list and expand on it by writing the same things over and over. had i known before i bought this book that webster has written a myriad of books on feng shui, palmistry, etc. i never would have bought it. for him it is obviously quantity and not quality- not to mention webster does not site his sources."
3,works good but not strong,"Big brush, works good. The only problem is the metal bends the brush when using pressure to clean the cooking grids."
4,Great brush for a quick clean up,I bought this brush because I wanted something that would not scratch my porcelain coated grates. It worked great.
1,not worth the money,The software won't load and that renders the keyboard useless. I can not get any support from I Concepts or Amazon. A bummer
5,Great beginner tube,Kids ride high with feet on the ground in a natural position. Well above splashing. can carry two but second rider has to hold onto front person ...if necessary. great ride for timid kids.
3,Good information but very judgemental,Good information but the authors put their own 2 cents in when it would better if they would remain objective. To me that was not very professional.
3,An acceptable case&#65533;,"I just received this case, and while doing its job acceptably, a few quirks and missing features keep it from being a great case. I have a Palm m130, and the case doesn't quite seem to fit it exactly. The handheld tends to move up in the case, which obscures the menu bar/date & time display. It is also lacking a window for the time display window in the flip cover that comes with the unit. The picture shows the flip cover still on with the handheld in the case, but this doesn't work very well in reality. The cover and the case just aren't aligned well enough to make this work. (The flip cover has to slide in and out of the flap of the case, and instead the handheld just moves up and down, which throws the buttons and screen out of alignment.) For about half the price of the Palm version, this case works, but lacks the refinements and details of the higher priced options."
1,Not the most in depth book,"I did not like this book at all. It was really hard to follow and was not very well explained or detailed enough in order to adequately play the instrument. This is especially true if the reader has had no previous experience with the autoharp. It gives the very basics to strumming and the barest basics to picking melodies. The author does not even include any musical notation. The CD that came with the book was not instructional, it was simply the author singing the songs. I would recommend ""Beginning Autoharp Instruction Book"" by Bonnie Phipps. This is a much clearer method to follow and I was much more successful with it."
4,Heaven on Earth,"This is one of the most beautiful places on earth, and we are fortunate to have it as a National Park. I have been there several times and the film goes a good job of sharing the parks beauty. I would have preferred that more time was spent on shots of the mountains and streams and less time on the bugs and scientific parts."
1,One long brochure for Morningstar,The book should have been for free considering it's a big advertisement. Nothing insightful unless you have never invested before or don't know what a mutual fund is.
2,Really didn't care for.,I couldn't get my grandchildren past the first fairy tale. I don't know why but they were not ever interested when I would begin reading it to them.
3,Good fairy tales,"It is an okay book with lots of fairy tales I have never heard of, and some of them were a bit strange. This book is good for anyone of any age."
3,Good Book,"Good book, keeps you guessing, has its good moments and its bad moments but all books have those issues. Also since it was free that is a bonus."
3,Scary yet Nice,"It was a really nice book with some very much creepy things. But still, I enjoyed reading it very much."
1,who checks the grammar?,"Appalling grammar and translation. If this is how we teach our children to read, we are in trouble. I deleted this after reading one story."
3,Fairy Tales that every child SHOULDN'T know,"I enjoyed the book, but I found that many of the stories are very sexist and very violent. Alladin and Ali Babba and the 40 theives are 2 of the most violent. Use discretion if you have a child who reads your Kindle."
4,Interesting take,"So far I am only about half way through, but I do indeed enjoy this. Some of the fairy tales are a little odd, and new to me, but fun to read. The only bad thing is that it is hard to pick and choose which fairy tale to read on my kindle. I wish I could skip ahead to certain stories, or back to favorites. All in all worth the free download!"
2,No,This was not a good book and I really love to read. I did not purchase the book just read the sample. Maybe it could be better if I had read the book
4,Wonderful,Lots of classics in here. Fables and Fairy tales every child should know. The title does not lie this is a must.
3,Fast service and product does match to the description.,"Fast service and the product does match to its website description. It will be nice to ship it in a box instead of a soft envelop, so the shipping will not damage to the product original box. I am okay since this is not going to be a gift for others."
5,Read this,"An excellant companion and suppliment to Martin Gilbert's early work The Holocaust which I have read many times. Well written with many pictures that only reenforce the words.I peticulary feel great admiration for the author by the fact that he does not waste the reader's time by adding politcally correct 'victims' to the list of the persecuted as most writers on this subject have done to history's detriment. Though Gypsies are entitled to have the extent of their suffering at the hands of the nazis known. They too were forced into the ghetos and were often shoved onto the same trains and the same gas chambers with the Jews, though occasionally on thier own."
4,Film is not Super HQ Speed,"The film is excellent becuase it is Fuji Film,however, the company is promoting the film as Super HQ Speed and it is not. It is regular 200 speed film when it arrives. I was given a full refund and was told to keep the product."
1,cute but a waste,This tent I spent I don't have any clue how long trying to put it together and never did get it together correctly or did I? I put it through the top of the tent loops as instructed and then the tent proceeded to fall right on top of me...I cannot believe I wasted money on this..The only difference was ours was the care bears tent which both girls were dying to play with..Mine is being returned for something else tomorrow...Not to count this tent will not fold up...Save your money...Assembling a play kitchen is easier than something like this...Terrible instructions and has way too many openings to put tubes...PIECE OF JUNK IS WHAT THIS IS...Cute but I am not wasting anymore time or aggravation on this item...It will be returned...
2,I really wanted to like this.,"In the poorly designed ""tent mode"" it is very flimsy. Within a week the support pole had pushed holes through the fabric making it even more tricky to assemble. About the only thing worthwile is the sleeping bag."
2,not that real,i got this doll for christmas and loved the way it looked and sounded like a real doll.the only problem is it dosent educate at all!i seen the dolls you get in 8th grade and thought it would be the same but its nothin like it all it does is make noises and move.i gave it good durability because my dog loves to try and eat it!
1,Safety Recall!!!,"I was getting the doll for one of my nieces but then I saw this recall warning I was concern, so be very careful. I didn't get because she has a young brother and my son that is only two and is always around her.Baby Annabell; Baby Anabell Care Set with Sheep Pacifier, RattleCategory: Potential CSPA labeling violationManufacturer: Zapf CreationItem Number: 785849, 785764Problem: Sheep clip detaches from pacifier and fits in choke tube. Has play value for a child under 6. No choke hazard warning.[...]"
5,Jim Logie,Wow! What a great book! I read it in a flash. It flows beautifully and the stories and poems are interesting and helpful. It even had some good suggestions for an old guy like me. I liked the conversational style with just the right amount of humor and kidding back and forth between the two authors. Their unusual writeing style was very effective and added to the enjoyment of the book. After reading the book Joan & Marc seem like my close friends.
3,Old version--new title for new version,"This book is fine, but a second edition which was revised and expanded was released in 2003 with the title The Russian Language in the Twentienth Century. I ordered both books, not realizing that the contents were nearly the same, with the 20th century version being the expanded version. Also, neither book seems to consider the massive changes that have occurred in the Russian language since the fall of the Soviet Union. For that you would do better with the Wade-Ryazanova-Clak book, The Russian Language Today, keeping in mind (unless they too have expanded) that the scope of the book ends somewhat earlier than ""today"". Bottome line, the Russian language has entered another period of rapid change--one that arguably even rivals the changes initiated by the Russian Revolution. No one book out there can truly encompass this period, since it has yet to end."
3,"Great album, but get the 20bit version","This is an excellent album, however the transfer of this version of Lush Life is somewhat lacking. The highs in a cymbal crash and most of the percussion hits sound as if they've been compressed (dynamics) too much. It's most noticeable on ""I Love You"" as Arthur Taylor's hi-hats gradually swish from crisp to muddy throughout the song. I'm not sure when this version was originally transferred, and perhaps this is because of the source material, but the 20bit version sounds significantly better. Has anyone else heard this?"
5,John John John,Life is good when you listen to this disc. John truly mastered is instrument like musicians rarely do (like kenny g).
1,HP vs15 monitor blackout,"My daughter's HP vs15 monitor just blacked out. It is deader than a doornail. Based on the other reviews I have seen, I will not even bother calling HP customer service. It appears that they consider these cheap little monitors to be expendable items, like ink cartridges. Avoid!"
1,Horrid,"Aside from a few good one-liners, this book is simple, one-dimensional and boring. The poetry lacks imagination and is full of the benalities obsessed over by someone too far in to astrology. I was hoping for more from such an author as Ms. Goodman - not this exercise is pure self-indulgence."
3,Why?,"This is one of Christie's best books -- it covers class well, raises an intriguing question for the reader to follow, and has a bunch of odd characters."
4,ruined it for me,Thanks to the person whose review is right above mine i didnt enjoy anything of the novel after that person blurted out practically everything abpout the murderers innocence and all.I woncder how thick headed people like you even understand agatha christies books? you probably dont..i guess you just flip to the last 10 pages and decide to come here and give a review..people like you are the bane of my existence.
3,Okay,"Its very realistic and all but not for a hermit crab. First the hammock is to small and to high! It is way to difficult to get the little guys up there, but other than that it has nice details."
1,Cheap Looking,It's a waste of money. They look so cheap and very bad quality. This must be worth like a dollar or less mass produced.
5,My favorites,"I have had my two dogs in Lupine collars and leads since they were puppies. They did chew through one of the leads, and it was replaced, no questions asked. just as the guarantee states. The only reason the collars were replaced was because they were bleached from the sun, and living in a tropical climate, EVERYTHING bleaches. I've recommended to all my friends that have four legged members of the family."
5,A Miracle of,"I have read James' ""Golden Bowl"" no less than four times, and each perusal brings with it a fuller appreciation of the author's genius! There are very few novels that offer the enormous challenges of this one. James' prose and syntax require a great deal of patience and concentration, but they eventually yield to the determined reader!"
1,All commas--No action,"The language in this ""novel"" is so pretentious and convoluted as to be largely unreadable by the average reader. It seems that James never met a comma he didn't like, and uses them to imbed all sorts or modifiers and asides. Although the graduate students may attach some deeper meaning to this, I suspect he really didn't have a clear idea of anything he wanted to say so he simply rambled on. At least with Faulkner there is a payoff. With James, all the language covolutions lead to nothing in the way of action. Random House must have had a large,unsold inventory of this book ( not surprising) so they included it in their top 100 list. James has single-handedly ruined my project of reading the all of the top 100. I will not, cannot, albeit I would like to, read,with any pleasure, the other two James books, novels perhaps, on the list, the Random House list that is."
3,Rebel Fever,I liked it a little better when reading the end of book about how it was based on something similar. However it read very average and some what predictable. Myk
4,Enjoyable,"This is a good yarn with mystery, suspense, interesting characters and some surprising twists. It also has the added interest of incorporating the author's intriguing theories which are explained in the nonfiction book, ""Plutarch's Parable"". You will want to read that one also."
3,interesting,I enjoyed reading this book if only for an opinion (not neccesarily fact) on what really happened in the garden after the fall. It made me think about Adam and Eve in a completely different light.
1,Waste,My cat is not interested in these at all.. even after I put mega amounts of catnip on them. Just a zero. She had much more fun with a wadded up piece of paper. Sometimes I think these pom poms might have a certain smell that turns cats off.
5,nice soft cat toy,Our 2 kittens really like these balls. They are soft and colorful. They enjoy chasing and attacking the balls. We put a few in a card board box with small round holes in each side and the kittens love to bat the balls and try and get them through the holes. They also loke to attack each other as one kitten will go inside the box and the other outside. Both kittens enjoy the balls. They appear well made and are a good value for the money.
3,For the Gambler,"If you are tired of cards, are on a plane or a boat and just want to do something different, these are great. We had fun with them but they really won't replace a good deck of cards. They could be a good gag gift too."
5,A treasure!,"This book uncovers the complexities of one of the greatest artists who ever lived, and reveals how human he was. The warm and conversational style with which it is written is so befitting to its subject, and it makes the reader feel as if they've spent many hours with a good friend. Thank you, Mr. Allen, for bringing such a legend alive for fans like me!"
3,"so, so novel","supposedly a ""classic"" victorian soft sex novel. Heard of it from an article on Victorian sexual beliefs in a British history magazine. If this is the guide as to how they felt, its no wonder the empire fell. Story tells of two young maidens captured by the Turks and enslaved. They meet several other slave girls who relate their stories as well. Basically the same tale told several times. Young maiden is either captured or sold into bondage, meets the glorious Turk, and becomes gloriously happy in her slavery.I wound up reading the first part and then skimming the rest."
5,Awesome stuff,"I've been a fan since 1995 when I heard the song ""down"" when it came out. That was a special summer. Ever since that time I've been a serious fan. I think the best thing about this DVD will be the rarities such as: Juan Bond, Outside, Jupiter(my favorite song), Stealing happy hours, and Starshines. If you dont have any of their cds, my favorite is ""Transistor."" I can't wait to see them being played live on this DVD. This DVD will definitely be the coolest concert you've ever seen!!!"
5,MUST HAVE DVD!,"This is a must own for all 311 fans. Over 4 hours of live footage with 64 songs and behind-the-scenes looks at the band for only $13!! It's an amazing deal. I have all of 311's DVDs and this is definitely the best. The quality is awesome and it is a great way to get your 311 fix in between concerts. Plus, it has the best version of D'yer Mak'er ever, and I don't think it can be found anywhere except on this DVD. Love it!"
5,Very good investment,"Of course being the hard care 311 fans that we are, we had to get his one to get us pumped for the 3-11 day this year in Memphis. We have seen them live several times but never been to 3-11 day. Sound is great and all of the good old school and rarities are on this two disc dvd. Of course all their new stuff is great, but we been hard core fans since 1994. Next best thing to being at their shows. You haven't experienced 311 until you see them live."
3,Insightful collection of essays on Japanese martial arts,"""In the Dojo"" is a collection of stand-alone essays by the prolific Dave Lowry, a devotee of traditional Japanese martial arts. This book is a deep, albeit at times esoteric, explanation of all key terms, concepts and rituals associated with the Japanese dojo.The book will appeal to practitioners or fans of Japanese budo: judo, aikido, kendo, karate, etc. Those looking to improve their technique will be disappointed.Some might find the emphasis on ritual to be stifling. One doubts if Lowry would care, as he freely acknowledges that the real of the dojo is not for everyone. A helpful glossary at the end helps with nomenclature.This book is a good read for those seeking the linguistic and philosophical underpinnings of Japanese martial arts."
3,Junk!,"I used this camera for a vacation and the frist film I put in it the camera broke, I lost some good pictures, so I am not happy one bit. So BEWARE this camera is JUNK>"
3,It is good computer at all but..,"It is a little different after received this item because of it has not been webcam built in. Actually the order preview has shown with the webcam built-in. So I purchased it but when I received that item that was very disappointed for me. Even though I informed to the seller, they did not take any action at all.Except this webcam cases, every thing is good."
5,Well written and important historically,"I've actually just finished reading this book for a second time, the first being 8 years ago. Found it again in my church library and read it in two days. An amazing story and worth the read."
4,Song Titles Listed Here:,1. Water2. She Never Gave In3. The Man Who Played Mandolin4. I Need You5. Mollie6. (I'm A) Freeborn Man7. Rebecca8. Fire Burning Still9. Old Black Mud10. Redwings
1,Keep shopping,"I phoned the company and found that this microscope only comes with a two year warranty. I found similar microscopes online for the same price that offer a lifetime warranty, and I ended up purchasing one from the Home Training Tools site."
4,Awesome and sturdy,"This is a beautiful piece. The only problem that I would note is that it is very heavy. You need to ensure that you have a stud to place it on. Also, it sticks out further from the wall than most other TP holders, so you need to ensure proper placement."
5,My Favorite FILM FEST Issue,"This is probably my favorite issue of this excellent DVD magazine series. Or maybe issue 3 is. I dunno. There is an outstanding short film on this disc called Protest that makes the whole disc. It's a must see if you are into computer generated animation - crank up the Aria, turn out the lights and stare at your screen - and the director's commentary on the alternate audio track really added to my already considerable awe. As for the rest of the disc, articles are cool, interviews are interviews, Call Me Fishmael is hilarious, Enchanted is a really solid student film out of Germany and Jorge is a charming, Quirky half hour short."
3,"Ehh. So, So....",This was ok. Nothing to go crazy about. Pretty bland tasting brownie. Tastes better if you add a lot of Splenda to it.Caramel wasn't a saving grace.
2,Dull until the end,This book was only mildly interesting until the end. The prose is good but the plot has few high points. The characters are shallow; they hop from one ill-conceived situation to another with little explanation of their motives. If the ending had not been so surprising I would have given this book only one star.
1,Self-Centered Attempt to be Different,"Rosner attempt to come up with an original idea in a literary world full of ideas that have been done to death. while she succeeds in the originality respect it is like that is all the book is about, how it changes from one pov without annotation and fanfare. beyond that idea the book is only a potpourri of ideas that made other books great, nightmares of the holocaust, ptsd/survivors guilt, political genocide in latin america, a singers quest and corruption in the music world across europe, and an autistic person. all together it is stupid, useless, and a self-centered attempt to become great and famous on the authors part. it depresses me i wasted time on this novel, i would have stopped and burned the book by page 2, but alas it was for school, and i feel i have to add i've enjoyed every other book i've read in school. this is the first book that i have EVER wanted to destroy to prevent another poor soul from suffering through it. DO NOT BUY OR READ, EVER!"
2,Not as good as I hoped,The book is so much better than the movie. I was surprised by how much the movie cut out important material that is in the book. I read the book first and I would have been confused with the story had I not done this.
5,price is right,I am very happy with the resulting prints from this camera. I've used other brands in the past and never have had such bright colors and in focus shots. The winding mechanism is easy to use. Finally I have pictures of my diving expeditions to remember.It's even suited for kids over ten to use. Mine had lots of fun with their own Quick Snap.
3,underwater cameras,"great pricing and speedy servicephotos did not come out very well, dark and foggy looking- not sure how much light is needed: all pictures were taken in very clear water less than 2 feet under"
4,inexpesnive.. and convenient..,very well worth the money for this camera.. only thing i can add is that it is available at walmart for $8.94.
1,CRAP,The camera was open when i received it. There was a HUGE Scratch on the lens cover making picture taking impossible. There were already 3 pictures taken on the camera when i received it. I order the same camera from another company it it worked great. The product is great the company is cheap.
4,Pictures with full sun,"Great camera, but need full sun to get best photos. When photos are taken in full sun, pictures are clear and full of color."
5,Awesome service,Thanks so much for the cameras! They were a great deal and I appreciate the fast shipping!
1,Was the water really so blue???,"I used this camera while snorkeling on St. John. Funny, I don't remember the water being so blue. There must be a blue filter or something on the camera. The pictures came out very hazy and the land pictures were blurry. I'm disappointed because the photos would have been gorgeous. It was very hot, so the condensation or saltwater must have done something to the camera. I would do what another user did in the future, rent an underwater camera."
1,Photos were awful,"This is the only underwater camera I have purchased, and I chose this one based on reviews here. I used the camera while snorkeling in Cancun, and only three photos even produced images. And those images weren't good. The first place I went, the water wasn't super clear, but the photos were worse than I expected -- negatives show slide after slide of nothing. The next place we went snorkeling was a cenote -- a limestone cave. The cave was extremely dark and required flashlights part of the time. Not surprisingly, none of those photos came out. If you are snorkeling only in pristine water with perfect visibility, then maybe you will get some shots, but otherwise I'd say don't even bother bringing this camera with you. The viewfinder is tiny, and if you are wearing a snorkel mask, as I was, you won't be able to really see what you're aiming at anyway."
4,Works well for this price point,We used these for scuba diving ~ 40-50 feet. They worked fairly well but could obviously benefit from the use of a flash. Not all of our pictures came out but I was generally satisfied.
1,waste of money,"Bought 4 fuji underwater cameras for my grandchildren to bring on our family vacation to Atlantis, Bahamas. One did not work at all. The other 3 were hard for them to handle and wind. What a waste of money."
3,"Pale, washed out colors","I used this at the beach with one of my friends during the summer. Taking photos were easy, and with the camera in the case, we were able to take pictures without worrying about the film, not to mention toss the camera around (or chase after it after getting buffeted by the waves- the camera floats)When developing the photos, they came out slightly blurry (even the ones on the ground) and the colors seemed pale and washed out. While I haven't used film cameras in a while, I'm still positive that the color quality is much higher than what we achieved.Then again, you get what you pay for- and it's not many digital cameras that you can take into an ocean and walk back out of it with your photos. For the price we paid, we're just glad we still have the memories."
1,Does not take PIctures below 40 feet.,"I bought 3 camera's for a trip to Maui. I used them when scuba diving. We took pictures in 45 - 70 foot of water.The visibility was greater than 100 ft. When the pictures were developed, they were either very faint or blank.It seems the camera needs a lot of light to give better pictures. So I would not recommend using them for scuba.Note: we also took picture in 10 feet or water. They look a little better, but still less than desired."
1,Useless,"I took 4 of these on a trip to the sea - to surf and snorkel. NONE of the underwater shots turned out, and the above water photos were so grainy and washed out I tossed them into the trash.Very disappointing!"
5,Great songs,I grew up with her songs ! The Alphabet song is wonderful - I'm teaching my two year old the French alphabet with it. You can listen to extract of all the songs on Amazon.fr - you need Real Player.
3,I Beg to Disagree,"It's worth the price just to hear an unabridged version. Capulet is wonderful. The friar is the best ever. Juliet is understandable but has the passion in her voice of a person who's been there a few times too many. But Romeo...a one-emotion three-hour agony to listen to. I've taught teens for thirty years; they don't languish in one emotion. If wallowing were an art form, Fiennes would be the grand master. He obviously doesn't remember how it was long ago when he was a teen."
3,Not Really My Kind Of 'Party',"House Party is a comedy that is shorter on laughs than it should have been. It's another one of those comedies that tries to be edgy by including as much profanity and vulgarity as possible, but forgot to include as much comedy as possible. The favorite part for me was seeing the always funny John Witherspoon (Friday; Wayans Bros. Show). Unfortunately, he only has three or four scenes. House Party isn't bad. It's just average, I think. And I expected more from a comedy that spawned three sequels."
2,Don't buy for use w/ Vista,"This was a great scanner, but now Visioneer has it classified as ""end of life"" and I doubt we'll ever see a Vista driver for it."
1,Not quite what was promissed,"This scanner is not quite what I thought I would receive. It cannot compare with the Visioneer 5800 that I was going to replace. The software included with the machine, will only allow you to use the WIA-Visioneer 90XX USB Scanner 1.0 software, and won't allow you to use the Scan Manager Pro 1.0 software which I found myself using with my old machine. Which I might add, is far more precise than using the other half of the software."
5,"""""Jumpoline""","My five year old granddaughter calls this her ""jumpoline"" and loves it as does her 2 year old brother! Great and durable toy."
4,Amazing for little kids,"This product was easy to assembly, its for 3 year olds. But our 1 year old can use this also its just the right hight! (: overall im very happy with this product!"
1,"leg broke when still new, seller did not return call or email","The trampoline was alot of fun for the kids. When I tried to fold it up, the top part didn't fold which made it impossible to put under a bed, unfortunately. My 3 year old was playing with it and the one leg broke right off. Thank goodness no one was injured. Not well made at all. I tried to contact the seller via email and phone. 2 weeks later and still no response. Very disappointing. I would certainly not recommend purchasing from this vendor or purchasing this trampoline."
3,"Child will love it, but not a value for parents.","My 5 year old loves this, no doubt. He's on it everyday. But after one year, the cord snapped (thank God it's not high off the ground) and my son is only 40 pounds. Now I'll have to pay $20.00 for a replacement cord (not including shipping). Screws popped out easily. If you're on the top floor of an apartmnet, beware of the noise it will make hitting the floor while your child is jumping. All four legs do not stay firmly on the floor. I'm not sure what the ASTM U.S.A. safety uses as it's approval, but mine isn't the only case of a broke cord. I too noticed two screws missing, but I didn't put it together and didn't notice until I saw a screw on floor. I was close to giving this two stars, but the cord is replaceable. I haven't decided if I will replace the cord or get a $30 trampoline from the sporting goods store (no bar). The cord may pop in another year or I might have issues with something else."
1,broken bounce,It is held together with a bungee cord that ripped apart in less than a week! with a 62 pound boy jumping on it. It is rated to 77 lbs. Don't believe it. It is not made to last AT ALL. Stay away unless you want it for a 2 year old... horror show!
4,Great for kids learning to jump,"My 2.5 yr olds daughter was having trouble jumping so I purchased this trampoline as per her therapists request. She has since began almost jumping. When kids come over and see this toy, they immeidately run to it! I would say its a hit. It was close to impossible to put together though. My husband was cursing and had robe burns on his hands. I would say 2 people need to put it together the entire time. Overall a good toy!"
2,"Great Fun, Flimsy structure","My seven year old son with Down syndrome received this for Christmas. He absolutely loved it. He only weighs 45 lbs and will jump for hours on this. The safety screws fall out all the time and we are continuously putting them back in. Also the elastic cord frayed and broke by the end of February. We called the company for a replacement and after almost a month, they sent us a new cord. It broke after only a week. Sadly, I think we must retire this well-loved trampoline because it is just not safe or durable enough."
3,Okay....,"I have read better. I don't know what the problem was with homegirl. The book that I got was a trade paperback and some sentences/words were cut off, which was frustrating, but it didn't impede the story. I still am wondering why the female character was behaving the way she did. The male lead seemed more stable than her. Hell, her daughter seemed more stable. She had some issues. Puleeesssee."
3,"excellent tasting, but...","There is no question that this makes excellent rice. The instructions for making porridge (grits, oatmeal, etc.) make it a little hard to come out as good as the rice. The only real gripe I have about this is the inner pot. It scratched after only about 3 uses. I only use the plastic paddle it comes with, so I am a bit perplexed as to how this happened. I went to the Zojirushi website to order a replacement and was astonished to see that this inner pot costs near $50 to replace!"
5,Staple cookbook for any dessert fanatic!,"I have had this book for over 10 years (!!) and it gets regular use in my kitchen. The simple recipes are easy enough for kids to make but delicious enough to please dinner guests. The recipes are fool-proof; I've never had a bad outcome. Everything from the pumpkin pie to the sticky ""sinnabuns"" (which I made for Easter this year) are wonderful! A definite crowd-pleasing cookbook."
1,I loved the Book,I gained nothing from the taped lecture and the strange one sided interview.The book has a lot to say and I would recommend it to everyone...the direction and purpose of this DVD is rather shallow and takes away from the impact of Naomi's other work.I would be a good idea to remove it from the marketplace.
3,New author-pleasant surprise,"I always love it when I find a new (to me) author that gives ""good read"". Hughes writes with a southerner's voice. Likeable and not so likeable characters that resonate because they are so believable. This is a perfect story for us insomniacs. One that thrills, and chills and even better; one that can be consumed in a single sitting. Or in my case a single sleepless night. Oh, and the 'love interest' is an added plus."
3,Want to know more about voter turnout?,"In response to the reviewer who wants to know more about voter turnout, especially the impact of the Motor Voter Act and election day registration, I recommend the recent book by Martin Wattenberg -- Where Have All the Voters Gone?"
2,I don't like it,"Oh man is this lantern a far cry from what I grew up with at summer camp. It is half the size and less than half the weight of what I consider to be a real hurricane lamp. Very poor construction. The only reason I am not giving it a single star rating is because I'm not surprised and I got what I paid for. I don't have to throw it away, but I'll only reach for it in an absolute emergency."
5,A must read for all fundraisers as well as Board Members,"I am currently involved in a Capital Campaign and found this book so helpful - from both sides of the fence. Through understanding the expectations that a Board member should have, it is helping me to frame my contact and training for the board. I refer to it regularly and would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to understand how fundraising works, and their responsibilities as a Board Member and for the fundraiser, a look from the Board Members shoes."
4,egg - 4 stars,"""The music on this LP(cd) is not dancing music, but basically music for listening to. It is harmonically and rhythmically complex, designed to be as original as possible within the confines of the instrumental line-up; so it's pretty demanding on the listener's attention"" begins the liner notes to this superb example of canterbury progressive album. Egg were a keyboard, bass, and drum outfit who were all excellant musicians especially keyboardist Dave Stewart who understood the concept of melody and improvisation inside the wonderful tone of his various keyboards. This is their intelligent and critically regarded debut which some have described as a cross between canterbury and rio which may be interpreted to mean melodically sophisticated to abstract progressive rock performed with great wit and artistic dedication. This is a great cd. also check out their even better follow up 'The Polite Force'"
3,Egg CD,I love 2 of the musical pieces. The other cuts seem like musical experiments which don't interest me to listen to more than once. 'Fugue in D Minor' is exceptional.
3,The Daybreakers by Louis L'amour,"Not exactly L'amour's best work, but this book is still a worthy part of the Sackett collection and deserves it place on the bookshelf of any L'amour fan. A typical Western with the 'good versus evil' theme, though it does attempt to go deeper and delves in topics like betrayal and what lies beneath a person's appearance. Also features a break-up between two central characters, rare for L'amour."
3,Incomplete Fragments of Better Stories,"For the most part, the stories in this collection read like incomplete fragments of better, richer tales. It felt like Russell set up interesting situations and introduced intriguing characters only to end the story before doing anything with them. The endings felt as if pages of the manuscript had simply been lost, instead of the openness being used to achieve an effect. Yes, stories do not need a neat ending; Katherine Mansfield's works prove that beautifully. However, that's very different to simply truncating the narrative arbitrarily and hoping it will be suitably postmodern, which seemed to be the case here.The one exception is the title story, which is quite stunning and worth reading by itself. It isn't worth the price of the book, though, so get the collection from your local library and skip to the end."
3,I really wanted to like this book ...,"Russell is a talented writer, whose stories are creative, imaginitive,and often times fun. However, as many reviewers have mentioned, frequently - all too frequently - there is no resolution, they simply end, as if to say,""well, that's it - time for another story.""The setting of many of her tales - the woods of south Florida and the south in general - were vivid, and were an element that I particularly liked. I enjoyed her characters and the unpredictable and slighly supernatural events they found themselves in. But I could never get used to the abrupt ending of her stories. I really wanted to like this book, but I can only give it 3 stars."
4,Lots of fun (and a bit of pain),"I thoroughly enjoyed this grouping of tales. They were lots of fun, with a bit of pain. They make you think. I'm hanging on to it for the future re-read."
4,Nice Suit,"Despite being less familiar than brands like Speedo & TYR, this a solid suit. The material is of equal or greater quality than the aforementioned competition. The suit is cut more like a 'full-sized' brief, rather than thin-sided racer briefs. The waist cord is white and flat/tape-like."
3,enjoyable,"when i found out that this was originally written as a television pilot, well, the whole film then makes sense.this IS NOT nearly as funny as Shaun of the Dead, it just isn't- nor is it 28 Days Later!but it is silly and quirky with excellent performances from all 4 cast members.the blood&guts; are NOT over the top, and it is semi-believable.overall, because it doesn't really go anywhere, I am only giving it three stars because, while it is good and i enjoyed it, and the performances are solid, it is just a pretty average film."
4,Laugh and Scream all at one time!,Zombieland is a fun ride for fans or horror and comedy. The main character is just so much fun to watch. I can't wait for the sequal!
4,For the love of Twinkies.,"Zombieland is a cool and satisfying horror/comedy flick from beginning to end. Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abiligal Breslin are wonderful and very funny in their roles as the ""non zombies"" Parts of this film are pretty gory, if you can get through all the blood and guts then you will enjoy the rest of the film. One of the reasons I was interested in watching Zombieland is because Emma Stone is an amazing actress, she's like a young Diane Keaton. And hey, look for a very hilarious cameo appearance from Bill Murray! And I love the scenes filmed at the amusement park, this is a film definitely worth checking out. Enjoy!"
4,So funny!,"Loved it! Woody Harrelson is the best! Never knew zombies could be so funny. Bill Murray was just great, too!"
4,Fun movie,Lets just start off by saying that this isnt the best zombie movie ever and its not the funniest movie. i enjoyed this movie it was pretty fun to watch. there were some cheesy one liners but there was some good action scenes in it. plus i like how they made things pop up on screen during the movie. it really added to it (you will have to watch to understand this. i give this a 4/5 i enjoyed it. i think it is a fun movie to watch with a bunch of friends
5,Awesome movie,"This is an awesome movie. Its hilarious. Not just another stupid zombie movie. The acting is awesome.Definitely worth adding to your collection. Oh, did I mention its HILARIOUS!!??"
2,I Thought it was a Comedy?,All the best scenes were show in the commercials. I thought it had funny ways of killing zombies. The first couple of scenes were funny. I thought it was going to build up from there. But it quickly fizzles from then on. At best this movie is worth watching 1 time only.
4,Enjoyable zombie movie,If you like zombies then you will enjoy this movie. Just good fun and entertainment.
2,more buddy romance than zombie movie,"The zombie scenes were very short and far between until the very end of movie. It more tried to be a romance and buddy movie which I was not interested in. I wanted a funny zombie movie like Fido or Shaun of the Living Dead. It was disappointing. It more focused on the love story between boy and girl. The few zombie scenes in the first two-thirds of movie were extremely short. We kept wondering when they were going to run into zombies, they went long stretches without any and then they would give us a two minute zombie scene. It had a few funny parts but it felt like they made a romance-buddy film and to add a new dimension, they threw in some zombies. So disappointing, I really wanted another Fido or the like. Now that was hilarious. I am trading in my copy it was so bad."
3,"Movie was ok, but come on.","Maybe my expectations were too high because of all the raving reviews I read before watching Zombieland. I did enjoy watching the movie, but I don't think it's as good as a lot of the reviews suggest. Prior to watching the movie, I was planning on buying it. It was worth the price of a rental, but IMO, it's not worth buying."
5,Love It!,Love it because it was so funny and it had great actors in it like Woody Harrison in it. If you love zombie movies. You have to watch this one.
4,It was good,It was a tad more comical than I like for a zombie movie but overall it was good. Walking Dead is way better.
5,Superb!,"What an awesome movie. Its disgusting, funny and action packed. A++++ This is definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a while. Must own on BluRay."
5,LOTS OF FUN,"ZOMBIELAND is the best zombie movie in a long time. It's witty, gory, inventive and very funny at times. Woody Harrelson and Jessie Eisenberg are perfect as the meek loner and the swaggering butt-kicker. Add Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin as conniving sisters plus a great cameo playing himself and you have the ingredients for an original zombie flick."
5,Need to be a Turk or better to understand!!,"The book is not for everyone who lacks imagination and empathy to understand others. It is all about two personalities in one person; the Modern Turk who is divided between two personalities; Western and Eastern. It is not about the Italian captive and his Turkish master but the legacy of Ataturk, the Turk who has two souls, who is divided between two cultures, two sides of the world. Two personalities , Italian and Turk are the same...Well, it is all about Mr. Pamuk, and his recognition of being a Turk. This is why he was awarded the Nobel prize, and why he is the best writer of this Century. He is not writing about others but ""him-selves""..."
1,IF YOU DID NOT READ A NOVEL BEFORE...,"...this is a book for you! But at the mean time this (or any other novels of Mr Pamuk) should be the last book you read rest of your life. How can somebody say ""great"" or ""wonderful"" for these novels, if he or she read before all the books of world authors like John Fowles, Peter Ackroyd, I.Calvino, P.Dostoyevski,....? I've really doubts about a person who read Mr.Pamuks and say ""I can finished and liked it"", this person never ever read a book in his/her life. Come on, literature is a serious culture sea of mankind and civilization and also life is too short to read the real ""first-hand-original-books"". Spend your reading time for them please. (Read some novels of Yashar Kemal and Aziz Nesin if you want to read Turkish authors.)"
1,Good writer WANTED to rewrite this book,"Do not waste your time on reading this dull and boring book. There are no dialogues to enliven the story. No single page lured me to go on. I was curious about the Nobelist, but after reading this book I doubt whether I can find enough patience to read the other book by Pamuk I bought... I now need a Simenon, London or Stevenson to breathe some fresh air. Pamuk should have written a 10 page story out of his idea. On the contrary he forces us to go through 166 more pages that persist telling the same things on and on. A great writer's job is totally different..."
4,All rightikins ...,I was amazed at how this worked. The light for darkness blew me away. I wanted the next size up but this one was the better buy for the price.
1,Problem with Sony product,"I bought this product for family event filming. After the warranty expires, the LCD touch screen display has issue, the screen starts playing up when turn on. Picture keeps moving up continously and makes it impossible to record/ view/transfer anything. If I turn on and wait for a long time (30 mins), it will stop moving up and I can record things, but by this time the battery is running out. I owned several Sony products due to its good quality, but this time, it makes me think twice before buying Sony camcorder in the future."
4,Smart and cute,I got new SR62 last month. It is small and cute. It is very user friendly.It is worth getting it.I love it
3,Simply average.,"Parents bought the camera and it was too late to return it. Pros: very light and easy to use. Everything functions very well. Cons: Image quality sucks and you must use the dock to transfer files to computer. For the image quality alone i would have returned this but i cant anymore. Would i buy again? for the price, definitely not."
5,"MacGregor 9"" Yellow Dimpled Baseball",Work great with heater pitching machine - The color helps with eye coordination for younger ball player - Practice with these and regular baseball to improve game
5,Solid and Trustworthy,"This camera takes excellent pictures, and has been a trustworthy companion on many a trip and occasion. It has a good solid feel that provides the real camera experience. The zooming feature is very accessible, and functions smoothly. The remote control is a terrific bonus! I go back to admire my many prints of friends, family, and scenery time and again! This camera has certainly stood the test of time."
1,"A boring, uninspiring collection of experiences","This book falls far short of being inspirational. Many of the contributors have blown up rather non-exceptional experiences into events of life changing significance. I have just finished book and cannot recall one story that left an impression on me. The titles of sections look promising but, alas, this book does not deliver."
1,New Age Chocolate,"This book was not inspirational. It was a bunch of stories written from a New Age slant. I was very disappointed and have read much more inspirational stories in ""Reader's Digest!"""
4,"DEAR GOD,DEAR ALICE, DEAR READERS,DEAR EVERYTHING,DEAR GOD,","Alice Walker brought me some idea about God. ""He ain't a HE or a She but a It."" And after all that time, when I exclaimed My God!,it says My IT! To boot, I learn that God exists everywhere and in everybody since God is everything.Everything that is or ever was or ever will be. And when you feel that or be happy to feel that You have found It.I realize,Whatever you do,believe in it first. And then you will win God,win everything..."
1,C'mon... gimmie something with substance.....,"Yeah... it is a book like a narrative journal. Yeah... it discusses ""culture."" Yeah... it makes me sick.It was tolerable.... but after awhile, it got old. Somewhere around page 30. If you have something else to read instead, don't read this one. Just another example of how pop culture tries to infect what quality is."
2,Didn't Live Up to the Hype,"I chose ""The Color Purple"" thinking it would be similar to ""The Help"", but I was disappointed. It takes place over decades, so it was lacking in plot lines or things would happen and not be mentioned again. Introducing Nettie's letters halfway through the novel seemed random, because they didn't relate at all to the rest of the novel."
1,"shallow, manipulative, over-simplified","It's a mystery to me why this book is so well-respected. As far as I can tell, it has only one character-- Celie-- and the rest are just empty figures who are either ""good"" or ""bad"" based most of all on whether they're male (bad, threatening, violent) or female (good, nurturing, uplifting). The plot is overly simplistic and manipulative- there just isn't much of interest here. If you had an option for 0 stars, I'd have given it 0."
5,Incredibly influential,"I would have never read this book had it not been assigned to me. That being said I am glad it was, this boom really changed my perspective on the world. I was quickly caught up in this book and inspired by it, it provides a greater understanding to the part of history that we try not to bring up. Some parts were a little bold in detail but necessary to get a point across"
2,Not a fan,Don't like the flow of this book. Hard to understand because of the language it's written in. I get why it's written that way...just don't care for it.
3,Can you HANDLE it?,The Color Purple is a fantastic novel that uses great literary devices. I would not recommend it to many students that are forced to read it by the government because of the graphic nature of the book in the dealings with rape and homosexuality. I do recommend this to anyone who is mature enough to handle the literature and who can understand the greatness of the work.
4,Oppressed Oppressor,I taught this book to high school students. I learned:Some oppressed people try to oppress others that are weaker than them.Women have much more power than men.And More...
2,I thought it was a very different type of story,"I read this book for an english book report. I found it disturbing with the incest, rape, turning to lesbianism. It was hard to follow, but the ending was alright. I really got annoyed at the Mr.______ though. I don't think I'd really recommend it."
2,Definatly should not be on any schools required reading list,Although the author probobly had good intentions of writing a good book she failed. The entire book is full of descriptive sex. Including man to woman and woman to woman. It is gross and an all around bad read. Why would any school require 15 year olds to read it
3,This musical tie-in edition apparently not available?,"Service and shipping were perfect--no problems whatsoever. My only concern is that I specifically ordered copied of this ""Musical Tie-In"" edition of the novel (for a project with a group of students who will be seeing the musical) and that is not what I received-all copies were of the new and more generic cover. However, the content of the writing is actually the most important thing and I needed these copies right away to distribute to students, so there was no time to contact the seller to address the issue. I do, however, think it would be better ""truth in advertising"" to not advertise the ""musical tie-in) version if it is not available."
2,the book the color purple,the book the color purple is a very good book.The book is kind of hard to understand because of the way that they talk. The book is about a girl name celie and she and she was the oldest out of her sisters so she was picked 2 marry a guy and that guy used 2 beat her and rap her. this book make me think about what do i what to be when i grow up and that im going to make more of my self as a black young lady.
3,Second reading,"I reread this book recently. I read it for the first time about 20 years ago and found it much more emotionally satisfying when I was 18. I still found myself crying at the end, but this time I felt like the story was more calculated. The only good man in this story was her sister's mentor/husband, someone who was also barely not even a character he was so one-dimensional. There was a huge man-bashing element to this book; almost every man was at least unsatisfying and at most an evil monster."
2,Didn't Understand,"Well i bought this book because everyone said that it was a great one and it was well written to perfection; however, i couldn't understand most of it...I couldn't get through the book. Maybe im too young..who knows? But i expected a lot out of this book and I was very dissapointed."
5,Seen the movie? Now read the book - it's worth the effort.,"Even if you're not a book person, take the time and read the book. Of course a five star classic."
5,surprise,i was pleasantly surprised by this classic. an incredible account of strenght from an atypical hero. i hope you will take a chance on this classic.
3,Gonzaga's Early Hits Collected,"This is an inexpensive and handy way to hear his early hits, mostly from the 40s and 50s. I prefer his later albums, which sound better and are more instrumentally varied."
5,A Comedienne for Adults,"Joan Rivers is a one-off. I have always enjoyed her humor, and this disc has some of the old, some of the new, along with a privileged look into her life and career. It is funny and poignant, and you get to see exactly what all of the cosmetic surgeries have done to her face."
5,Can We Talk,"Joan Rivers:A Piece of Work is one of those films that cuts thru the BS. It is honest, raw and to the point. It is a year in the comedianne's life which including The Trump's apprentice show and win.You see Rivers, who is a 50 year veteran of comedy, showcases that she is still struggling being a comedy genius. This is the real woman who hates seeing her appointment callendar blank.Ricki Stern keeps the focus on Rivers..in good or bad. What amazes me is Rivers recants her career as well as the year in her life. It is the ups and downs in that year.One of the highlights is a heckler who talks back to Rivers from the stage and how she puts him in his place.This is an amazing piece of filmmaking. I just wish it could be up for an Oscar. The Academy said that this film could not be nominated for an Oscar..how depressing!It is worth watchingBennet PomerantzAUDIOWORLD"
2,Este no o melhor CD dele. This isn't his best CD.,"Este CD é instrumental. Ele no canta, no. A música é legal mas cansa. Se voc for f de forró eu recomendo Luiz Gonzaga, mas procure um CD em que ele cante também.This CD is instrumental. He doesn't sing on it. The music is cool but it gets old. If you're a fan of forró I recommend Luiz Gonzaga, but look for a CD in which he sings as well."
2,"Blah - a review of ""Month by Month a Year Goes Round""","Pedestrian production, my two children (boy and girl; just turned 4 and almost 6) found the rhyme boring and uninspired. See below for example.""March and April,drip-drop-drip,everything is melting,with a plip-plop-plip.""Two Stars. Sturdy pages and colorful art are not enough to overcome the uninspired text. There are many other books that do a better job. [Check out: ""Mama Cat's Year"" or ""What Makes the Seasons"" for alternatives.]"
1,Yuck!,"Not only was this poorly made and missing half of what it was supposed to have. It smelled strongly of smoke, returned it!"
3,Too Good to Be True,"I gotta admit I was taken in by the book, but the problem comes in when you attempt to link the NPS score to any performance measure. The academics have all but refuted Reicheld's claims. Unfortunately, statistics matter and the best way to measure something with a survey is to use a multiple item, multiple measured scale. However, NPS does have some redeeming qualities, in focusing mangement behind one number. Many academics are recommending that if you must use NPS to use it along with other traditional statistical measures."
2,From the Bain&Co's author of Loyalty.hype,"More Bain & Co hype, with not much evidence or substance. Yes we know there is lots of wasted resource allocation, but we need practical solutions.The book is full of pseudo-statistics, and like the earlier book, the Loyalty effect, many made-up numbers. Evidence, empirical generalisations, hard facts are lacking.This is the ultimate con in business literature, an argument from the particular to the general. There is no ultimate question that fits all situations. Buzz marketing only applies in limited circumstances.Managers who follow this books advice are likely to squander money. Avoid.Suggested reading:- Customer equity (ISBN: 0875847641)- Marketing and the Bottom Line (ISBN: 0273661949)- Marketing Payback (ISBN: 0273688847)"

1,Waste of Money,"This is the biggest waste of money - do not buy it - it will not work!It's just people saying a certain word, then a 10 second pause ... then a different word and another 10 second pause. You can create your own if you really want to try this.But you really should not leave this on for your bird all day - it should be done in 10 minute intervals only or your bird may get irritated by it (i know i get irritated by it after only 2 words).Don't waste your money on this."
3,MY WIFE AND I HAVE LEARNED SOME NEW WORDS,WE HAVE HAD THIS FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS. I HAVE A TWO MCCAWS ONE 8 YEARS OLD THE OTHER 14 WEEKS. SO FAR THE LITTLE ONE WILL MIMIC ALL OF HIS BIGGER SISTERS BAD HABITS BUT THE CD SEEMS TO BE INEFFECTIVE. THE WORD OF THE DAY IS BYE BYE BYE BYE. I SUGGEST NOT BEING HOME DURING THIS EVENT :)
4,Feathered Phonics The Easy Way to Teach Your Bird to Speak Volume 1,I believe this CD will help train any bird that is capable of speaking.Linda from Pennsylvania
2,Break when dropped :-(,"I would never buy these again or recommend them because if you drop them (or they roll off the table) on wood or tile floors, they break. Then, you have to twist until the rest of the crayon that is still attached comes out. What a waste! The piece that falls out of the plastic tube is too thin to use alone. Waste of plastic, too. I guess I only recommend them to people who have carpeted floors or some way of defying gravity while using these crayons."
3,"Good book, poor publisher","I recommendMy Best Games of Chess, 1908 - 1937instead. Same notes, more games, better price."
4,Excellent and convenient black and white.,I've shot a lot of this film and really like it. It has excellent latitude and is easy to get developed and scanned. (I use a local shop and sometimes walgreens when I'm out of town.)
5,"Overall, A big Thumbs Up!!!! (Please Read)","Although i'm not the biggest fan...i will say it's much better CD than i thought..in fact i gave it a five. If you are into rock and want something with good beats to listen to as well as having a total CD that actually has more than just a ""few"" hits...this is a buy! I would say almost all if not all are very good songs...Thumbs up!"
4,"Four Stars, One X","The second Three Days Grace album, One X, is a very solid record indeed, but it's not as good as their debut, which has more determination. My favorite songs off of the album are the singles (except for Riot, which has an annoying F bomb in the second verse), It's All Over, Time of Dying, and... that's about it. I'm not saying at all that this is bad, because it is getting a high rating, but it sure is not as good as Three Days Grace.Rating: 3.5 stars/5 stars"
5,Great 2nd album,"There first was easily a 5 star album, this one is probably 4 1/2. There's two weak tracks towards the end but for the most part another great hard rock album with lots of catchy songs. Their songs sound more mature this go around. Wish it hadn't taken them 3 years, hopefully we'll get a 3rd cd in 2008, not 9. Still a great cd from a great new band."
3,"Great cd, but filler outdoes hits","-Top Songs-5: Gone Forever4: Riot3: It's All Over2: Never Too Late1: Animal I Have Become-Filler-7: Pain6: One-X5: Time Of Dying4: Get Out Alive3: Over And Over2: Let It Die1: On My OwnGuys, believe me, if there is one reason to buy this cd, buy for the top, not 'Pain', the so-called 'hit'."
5,Lets keep these 5 star ratings going....,"This is an excellent sophomore album from TDG. I don't know why there saying its softer than the first, if anything its heavier than there last cd. There are a few soft songs on here but then again theres more heavy than soft songs like Pain, Riot, Animal I Have Become, It's All Over, Let It Die, and One X. I waited for 3 years for this disc to come out and the wait is definately worth it, even though they told me it was suppose to come out in 2005 that was a long year waiting for releases to come out. Well so far this is one of the better releases of 2006 other than RHCPS Stadium Arcadium that one is the best release of 2006 (so far). I just hope there third album doesn't take another 3 years to be released I don't think I'll be able to wait that long for something from Three Days Grace."
2,Three Days Grace,"Not a real bad CD, not a real great CD, It has one or two songs that really stand out, and then the rest sound like your typical K-bear played melencholy hard rock songs. the song ""This Animal I have Become"" is great with a simple but interesting bass line to start the beginning of the cd, a little bit quick, moves around, making it fun to listen to, and there are some simple changes that catch the ear, but the rest the cd really doesn't grab my attention, just by the sound alone I couldn't sit through this cd in one sitting, That would be near torture, for me. Either way I tend to you tube songs before i purchase a CD if i question wether I'll like it or not. be a good thing to do before you purchase it. Yep, get the track listing, you tube the songs, listen to the whole thing decide.P.S. I usually don't pick out singles, but often I find that I like another song a lot more on the CD that most people won't even be aware of, the case was not so this time."
1,Sorry Lyrics,"The band is excellent. They are good musicians and play tightly together. The problem is the lyrics are awful. This is nothing less than nightmares set to music. If you have these same thoughts running through your head, seek some professional psychiatric help. Absolutely not recommended for young listeners. Parents you are warned. No wonder the record industry is on the ropes."
4,3.5 Stars actually. Good album.,"Contrary to most of the reviews written here, I think this album is a MUCH better disc than the first one. Their debut was defintely the group trying to feel out what it felt like to longer be Groundswell.All this being said, Three Days Grace is a pop rock outfit. Their last album was pop, this one is pop, only this one displays a much more mature viewpoint. The songwriting has improved vastly, and they've shed quite a bit of the adolescent skin they used to have.Too good a CD for most of their fanbase to appreciate it seems."
4,Practical Approaches to Teaching the Bible,"In this book Dick Murray, professor of Christian Education at Perkins School of Theology, provides several methods for teaching the Bible. His methods endeavor to place the focus on God's Word--not on the teacher or the method--making the Bible accessible to adult and youth learners with varied learning styles. The book provides easy-to-follow procedures, often with several options. Murray provides several practical approaches to helping people learn about the Word of God."
2,Day #6,"I bought this product about a week ago, I already have an natural orange undertone to my skin so I was afraid I was going to be really orange. It didn't turn me orange, but it didn't turn me tan either. I put thick coats on every day and I have seen nothing, no change, no tan...nothing."
3,3.5 tet,"3 1/2Still finding his electronic footing with this pre-millenium debut, Dialogue nonetheless sees a sure start for the laptop samauri, if not providing fully-fleshed compositions than still certainly giving out the distinct and consistent vibe of being on the cusp of something new and fresh."
5,Excellent,"Ok, maybe I'm a bit biased because I'm a fan of the ""Complete Reference"" series, but this book does not disappoint. It ""talks"" to a non-computer technician like me. With the book I have discovered many new, nifty features in Win2K (still a beta version), and I will definitely by the software when it's released.The material is clearly represented and the screen shots helpful. You'll learn pretty everything about Win2K, including the critical networking and security issues. This is pretty much a cover-all book, but I wouldn't be surprised if many things are left out; after all, Win2K is a very advanced and feature-rich piece of software."
2,Not sufficient. Very thin material.,"This is a pretty lousy gaiter. It's made of thin, stretchy material (approaching semi-transparency). For times when you actually NEED a neck gaiter, you'll need something more. And it can only really work as a gaiter or a headband, there's NO WAY this will stretch or stay in place to the point where you can use it as a balaclava, or some of the other multiple uses it claims it can be used for. El cheapo.Returned."
2,Developed badly,"I have not had good results lately with this film. Took some really important shots of daughter graduating AIT with the Army National Guard and the pictures were grainy, uneven in color, and blemished."
1,Playstation game cards are not any good - 9/2012,"Sony discontinued this game earlier this year, so buying these cards will not let you play Everquest. You will need to buy a 30 day SOE card to play, or subsscribe, or there is even a free version of the game you can play now, details are at soe.com."
3,"If Forgeries, Where's Reality","As a compilation of writings and musing with photographs and muted paintings, this book reads like a very intensely personal diary/journal and family photo album with an obsession for ""RED."" Because of the melancholic nature of the writings, it was difficult to comprehend the reality of ""Forgeries."" The photos show clarity, concise images with good composition though many are personal family shots. It is an interesting view of the author's family and home life but surpising, as a celebrity, anyone would want this much exposure to one's personal private life for outsiders to take a peek. Amazingly many of these photos and location for photo shots reoccur in other publication by the author/artist/photographer. The book is for the curious but not an inspiration as a keeper for literary and artistic merits."
5,Excellent!!,"It will open your eyes! I homeschool now, not just for this reason, but now my children will never go back to public school. This book doesnt force homeschool though, it is just an option they briefly mention. They give you ways to fight for better text books in your public school and also your rights as a parent! You may want to read through your childrens books with them as well so you can correct anything they learn that is incorrect or against your values! This has been going on for a long time, I could relate to some of this personally from when I was in school over 10 years ago.. I'm sure it is much worse now! A must read!"
4,Education or Indoctrination,"The Gablers do a great job of comparing America's traditional educational institutions with the modern public school system. For a couple of hundred years the Bible was an integral part of a young person's education in the United States. But that has changed in the past few decades. This book is dated now, but I think it is still thought-provoking and historically important."
4,"A good, detailed translation","Very expressive, and faithful to the original. The links in the table of contents are bare-bones - not helpful if you're looking for a particular chapter. A few text-to-digital quirks, like ""the"" in place of ""die"" in most cases, but when you come upon an out-of-place word you can figure it out from context. Other than that, prepare for a long, long read!"
5,"RICH, VERY RICH!",ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BOOK! It is amazingly rich and deep. I have read (or listened to) other versions before - this is THE ONE to read and own.
2,"are you kidding me, amazon??!","this is NOT the ""stunning new edition translated by prizewinner Christine Donougher"" but rather a tired edition that came out in 1976! the ONLY reason that i gave it 2 stars is because, come on, it IS les mis! still, this is an instant return. i already own two superior translations."
4,Torn,"I'm a little torn about this novel. In one sense it seemed like some of the portions really took me forever to get through and I almost gave up on the book. (I finally finished after 5 weeks of reading) However, I have been finished reading the book for about 4 months now and the story is still with me. I feel like the characters are so amazing and layered and heartbreaking that they cannot be forgotten. I have read a lot of books in my 25 years, but Jean Valjean and Cosette have seemed to seep into my subconsciousness just like Harry Potter and Jay Gatsby. I feel like they will be with me forever. I will never regret reading this book."
2,Too abridged,I love the story of Les Mis. But this book left out what I cansider to be important details and leaves the reader a bit confused with the some of the events. I would suggest this version to someone who wishes to be merely introduced to the story. Not to a serious reader.
2,does not live up to the original,"After reading the unabridged edition that was loaned to me, I decided to purchase this edition. If you have never read this story before, you owe it to yourself to plunge into the original text. This abridged edition leaves out important character-related text, and just skims the surface of what is a beautiful story. This version does not leave you feeling much for the characters. I will take more time choosing the next Les Mis book and make sure it tells the whole story. This book seems to have been written with the movie in mind, and just doesn't do Victor Hugo's work justice. The original story is perhaps the greatest novel ever written. Shame on Charles Wilbour for dissecting Hugo's work like this!!!!!!"
3,Simple Abridgement,"This is a 3 hour, very simple retelling of Victor Hugo's Les Miserables. It's good for children and youth, but a little over-simplified for adults."
1,BEWARE!!!!,"Beware, amazon has mistakenly identified this, the Everyman edition, as being translated by Julie Rose. That is false. It is the dreaded Wilbor translation."
3,Use less without over the head attachment,"Does not come with over the head attachment, it shows in additional pictures though. Useless without over the head as ear piece keep falling."
2,Read this first!!!,"please do not buy this product, yes it is affordable and stylish, but you cant let looks fool you. This item has absolutly no anti shock. I litterally walked, yes WALKED with it and it skip atleast 7 times in a 9 second period. If you are planning on using this product for sitting only, by all means purchase it. but if you are planning on walking with this, ANYWERE, dont buy it. get the one that looks like it, but says 60 second esp. it doesnt skip. i took my old one in and traded it for the one with 60 second esp and works fine."
2,Risky,"I just got this camera and was first delighted by all the features it carries within an acceptable price. However, after careful observation, it seems that this camera's design is old and technology outdated since 1993 (this is the default start date set by the camera itself, which makes it risky). Also, it doesnt run smooth and I've heard bad things about Fuji's customer service as mentioned by others. I am disappointed and plan to return it back for an exchange. You are better off with a Nikon 90 QD/120 ED or, if you can afford, a Canon Rebel.This is a sincere advice: Don't buy this brand!"
3,Not Deluxe,"The element is actually narrower than the one I replaced, so there is actually less surface area in contact with the pan. Definitely nothing deluxe about it, but it works about as well as the original."
3,"Great in spots, though dated","First thing right off the bat, the music is dated from the time it was created so not sure how a more ""modern"" audience will take to this. ""Acid folk"" would be a fairly accurate description, but by no means confined to that genre. Some of the tracks are simply great,and have aged much better than some of the other less-than-great tracks.For point of a more modern musical comparison, the British band Circulus have obviously been influenced by this obscure act (particularly with the medieval vibe),and for my money pales in comparison.I give this three stars as the more dated tracks weigh it down a bit.Not essential, but I am glad to have it in my collection as the curious musical obscurity that it remains."
5,Lost in Translation,"If you liked ""Lost in Translation"" with Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, you'll like this movie/soundtrack. The sweeping visuals of Shanghai and Hong Kong, coupled with the dreamy ambient music, share some of the same ""travel"" vibe in the scenes of the Tokyo cityscape. Both soundtracks are great for listening while slogging through airplanes and airports on long trips - keeps me sane, and adds a little taste of adventure to it."
4,Quality built toys still exist.,This toy gun is heavy and durable. I love it. The only issue I can honestly bring up about it is that it is built for small hands. Roughly about the right size for a 4 year old to 10 year old. If I hold this gun (which I bought for my zombie cowboy Halloween costume) the grip ends inside my closed fist instead of coming through at the bottom of my palm. My 4 year old son is going to love this thing when Halloween is over!
3,"Nice, but I got defective one","The barrel is not screwed in, so it falls off every time my son opens the gun to replace the caps. I imagine this is a defect in our item, rather than a design flaw.If it wasn't for this it would be a great toy."
3,Leung Kar Yan fan,"I have always been a fan of Leung Kar Yan and his fighting style but here he only fights at the end of the movie, this film has a lot of big stars in it like Lo Lieh, Fei Meng, Phillip Ko,and Kam Kong. But I found the action not to be well choragraphed."
1,S HEBA,SHEBA WAS OVERLY SIMPLISTIC AND SO SLOW IN TELLING A STORY I QUIT READING THE BOOK AFTER BY THE 10TH PAGE. IF I GET A BOOK I ALWAYS FINISH READINNG THE BOOK. NOT IN THIS CASE.
3,Review,"The movie was okay. The vhs worked good, but beings it's vhs the quility isn't as good as dvd. It was Okay."
3,"Good start, better finish","Bought this based on the great reviews since there were no preveiws available to hear. Cool beginning and the last several selections are very good. As expected, the tone is nicely dark, forboding, and somber. The middle, however, is filled with quite a few underimaginative, underproduced, repetitive instrumental songs - how many augmented fourths can you play before it all sounds the same? I understand Nox Arcana is going for the ""diabolus in musica"" but after a while it just becomes tedious. They use a lot of chimes and computerized vox humana on this cd."
4,Starting to dig it!,"Before Metallica, Deep purple was the second band to do an arrangement with an orchestra.(the moody blues the first). At first I didn't know what to think. But, after listening to it a few more times I dig it. Maybe not for the true metalhead.If you like classical music, you'll surely enjoy this one."
3,"Good, but perhaps not if Greek is one's first language","I had both the fortune and misfortune to undertake Ancient Greek as my first language. My college course used this book, and I have both good and bad things to say about it. It is a good book because it is pretty straighforward and uses actual Greek texts to translate from the very first day. On the other hand, sometimes Allen presents Greek with things in it that the student has never been taught about before. I would recommend this book as a great review book or to someone who has already taken Latin or another inflected language. My Greek is pretty good now, but I feel that I would have greater confidence if I had started with a different book."
4,Mellow rap,"Coolio's ""C U When U Get There"" is a really nice, mellow rap song. It was released in 1997, when it was certified gold and went to #12 on the pop chart. The song is based on classical music - Pachabel's Canon (which you hear at weddings all the time). Coolio has always been a fairly poppy rapper, so this song isn't a major shock when compared to his past hits. The CD also includes, ""Hit 'Em,"" which is a more typical rap song. The only disappointment is the remixes, which don't sound very different from the album version. I haven't seen much of Coolio since this song was a hit (although he rocked on ""Celebrity Bootcamp""!!), but he apparently has a new CD coming out soon. I'm interested to hear what it's like. If you're looking for some rap that's a little less hardcore, then you should check out this CD."
4,Good Stuff,"I'm a fan of Cannonball Adderley, I really am. He's one of the best saxophonists who ever lived. This gives a variety of different ways he played, and with a great song sack O' Woe, Mercy,Mercy,Mercy, The Jive Samba, and The Chocolate Nuisance. Great CD. However, the best cd by him is the one below.1. Timeless Cannonball Adderley ALL GREAT SONGS, EXTRAODINARY!P.S Please Check Out My Reviews On The Recommended CDs!"
5,cd George beverly shay,"I bought this cd for my mom and she really loved it. She was really happy that i was able to find George Beverly shays music through your company, We looked at a couple other places but could not find any of his music. I thought to go online and and tried to go through Amazon and i am glad that I did, Because i can find alot of things that i cant find any place else. Thank you Amazon"
4,How sweet to listen,wonderful set of songs that my father loves to hear. Beautiful voice to put to the songs that we will never forget.
5,Wonderfull,Johnny sings with just guitars. He doesn't miss a note! Right on key. Another hit in my Johnny Mathis collection. Will be a great addition to yours. The original release for this album was in 1959 and Johnny was 24 years old. I found the 33 RPM record when I was a teenage and what happened to it I don't know. But now I have the remastered CD. Get it...enjoy it!
4,Take time to appreciate,Music: 4 starsSonic: 4 starsMathis has a very good voice. It takes some time to appreciate this album as songs were sung in a free style.
4,Stanford,"The history of the founding of the university was very interesting, seeing how the ""Robber Baron"" money of the 19th century could result in the establishment of such a major institution. Particularly interesting was the comparison with more rigid traditional 19th century universities and the more open ideas upon which the univesity was founded."
4,Not enough Poirot!,"I was happy to get this book from the library yesterday and was looking forward to another Hercule Poirot mystery.Alas, he's seldom in the action, which I find disappointing, although I did like the book. Surprising ending which caught me off guard. I loved the last sentence. It would have been terrible if he'd gotten the poisoned drink!"
3,Three Act Tragedy,"This book was originally published as ""Murder in three Acts"" A pretty good book but not one of hervery best."
3,Nice,"A nice little Hercule Poirot mystery - actually, it's only barely a Poirot mystery, as he is absent from most of the book, making only a guest appearence at the beginning, and in the last section, he comes to wrap things up. The plot itself is rather simple, and you could stand a decent chance of guessing the end correctly, if not for a complication Christie throws in which makes things difficult (for the reader as well as for Poirot himself). All in all, a pleasent read. Not her best book, to be sure, but pleasent nonetheless."
4,Worth adding to your library,Very interesting channelled book outlining an alternative version of earth history and the ET origins of man. Logically presented. Jam packed with info.Loved the diagrams: The 8 dimesions; 13 Chakras; Photon Belt; Spiritual Heirarchy/Time Lords; Lyran/Vega path to Earth migration; Map of Lemuria/Atlantis/Yu Empire/Iona. All very helpful!I'd also recommend: The Earth Chronicles by Sitchin ( probably the best researched info out there)and books by Pat Cori (The Sirian High Council) and Barbara Marciniak (The Pleaidians) .
4,"a good book, but calm down!","Certainly a good book, though somewhat lightweight. People truly interested in creativity will need to look further into Sternberg & Lubart's articles, and into the wider literature on creativity. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the above two reviews are either nonsensical, fanatical, or drivel. Science certainly involves creativity, and often tremendous amounts. Though one review talks about scientific bias, if you ask Sternberg which epistemology he bases his work on it will certainly be science. Don't be scared or dissuaded to try other books - Csikzentmihalyi's is a good intermediate one, and the Sternberg-edited Handbook of Creativity is a comprehensive text at a level both deeper and wider."
2,Dropping the ball,"This was a great book, if you count the ending. The characters are funny, and the style is pretty good if you don't count the stunted switches between narrators. The plot was definitely interesting enough to keep me, but the ending leaves much to be desired. In fact, half of this book bugs me to no end, and despite them being pretty decent characters, what they agree to will make you furious. However, knowing that romance novels generally have happy endings, I persevered and was disappointed when Judy Markey completely dropped the ball. In the very last seconds of the book, she patched up everything with minimal cohesiveness. In other words, I couldn't imagine the characters doing what they ended up doing. Without a more drawn out ending, this book is not worth the time.Read it (or listen to the cassette) if you have little else to do, but you're better off with a more stable romance novelist like Jayne Ann Krentz or going and renting yourself a romantic comedy."
4,Nice book to spend a late evening or weekend with.,Very enjoyable and light ; the kind of book I wish there were more of just for a little enjoyment away from all the deep thoughts we have to indulge today. These characters became my friends as I read. I can't wait for Judy's next book and hope it will be just as enjoyable. Also hope she is working on a third novel.
5,Great product and great service,"Ordered the sprouts and the package arrived in less than a week. There were a few broken bags, but they were replaced in less than a week after I called. All the seed I've sprouted so far have a very high germination rate. Overall, I'd recommend this product to anyone who enjoys growing their own sprouts."
5,A terrific product!!,"I bought my Tiger water heater in Korea in the mid 90s while working there. I keep it plugged in all day and love this. I was worried I'd not be able to replace this if mine ever quit on me so I just looked it up and so glad I will be able to get another one if mine ever dies. I have this instead of a coffee pot and really love it. Ever so often, I put a cup or so of vinegar into the hot water (fill to the line), unplug it and let it set overnight to clean all the minerals from my water. The next morning, I just wipe with dish rag inside and then I rinse well and fill up again. This keeps any build-up from inside the kettle. I'm just thrilled I was able to find this online to order when I need one. I might even order one soon as a ""back-up"" just in case. Yes, it's funny when my friends visit, they have never seen anything like this and act like it's an ""Asian"" thing. Now I can tell them they can get one, too."
1,Wretchedly written account of a great comedian's life,"With the wealth of family scrapbooks and intimate anecdotes provided by Ronald Fields (W.C.'s grandson), it is difficult to see how someone could so thoroughly destroy what should have been an entertaining book. Louvish's mess is unreadable, aggravating, smarmy and smart-alecky. A sheer waste of precious anecdotes clumsily recounted by an inept writer. When Louvish does any original research on his own, he gets his facts wrong, to boot. Forget this mess and seek out W.C. FIELDS BY HIMSELF, at least the Fields letters are undoctored there and in the great man's own entertaining style of prose."
1,"badly written, disappointing excuse for a biography","W.C. Fields was a great comic and a true original. As such he is deserving of a great biography - this isn't it! Louvish is simply not a good writer. His lame attempts at jokes a la Fields fall flat as does his editorializing. He also can't quote film lines accurately which is a pretty serious failing when we're talking about films available on video or seen regularly on AMC or TCM. Yes, Louvish has done research but, like his equally lame Marx Brothers bio, the research is spoiled by a poor, self-indulgent style.Skip this poorly written excuse for a biography, search out a copy of Ronald Fields' ""W.C. Fields by Himself"", and let the Great Man speak for himself. Even though ""W.C. Fields His Follies and Fortunes"" may not be accurate, it's a lot more fun than this and captures the spirit of Field far better than Louvish."
4,Great toy,Bought for my advanced 5-year-old niece and she loves it - teaching her gun safety at a young age. I think it is a great toy and a great price
4,Please check your posted reviews for this book.,"I'm not sure the reviews listed for this book go with this book. What about C.J. Cherryh?! It has been awhile since I read it, but isn't this book part of her downbelow station universe? Please check this out. Thanks."
2,Great Reference Aid,"I purchase many books from Amazon & Amazon Kindle. I rely a lot on my fellow readers to guide me in my purchase decisions. I ordered Stalins Slave Ships for My Kindle I downloaded the free introductory read. The free introductory read was enjoyable reading, but when I dowloaded the rest it beagan to read in an encyclopedic manner about the Gulag fleet. Therefore I would recommend this book to those who need to look up Gulag ships on a reference basis. I have one I would sell cheap, however I am to lazy to do the work involved."
2,I didn't finish it,"I enjoyed the author's sense of humor, but found it grating after a while. The characters did not seem real to me. Instead, they were overdone and somewhat stereotypical. It felt like the main character was trying too hard to amuse us with her witty take on everything. I hate not to finish a book that I have purchased, but I gave up on it. The storyline definitely had potential, but I wouldn't recommend this for people who prefer more serious suspense novels."
4,Words of Wisdom for Moms,"Quick read if you do it in one sitting. Or leisurely read if you read one lesson per sitting. Eighty-one lessons are included for contemplation and meditation. The Tao includes words of wisdom about honesty, atonement, being firm and relaxation. Beautiful illustrations accompany most lessons. Everyone will find resonance within these pages. Perfect as a Mother's Day gift."
5,Brilliant Acting by Alan Rickman,"A very different sort of movie, but Alan, as always, comes shining through with his brilliant acting. When watching the movie I thought Natalie (Alan's wife in the movie) must be out of her mind to cheat on Sinclair(Alan), and of all things with her own brother! Talk about spoiled little rich girl, Sinclair & money besides! The only slow part of the movie was when the wife & her brother were in scenes by themselves, I thought anyway. She could be annoying at times"
2,Poor quality dvd manufacturing,"The movie is good, but I am a collector and I expected a professional manufacturing DVD and did not. The DVD looks like a homemade copy of these with blue base, I am disappointed, so I only give it two stars.It is better for you to know that you decide if you spend your money on a dvd that looks like a homemade copy."
1,RIPOFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Yes, the title states three color multi-pack, but the picture clearly shows 4 ink cartridges. Including black. If you order these you will get only 3 color cartridges at $16.31 each plus shipping. These inks go fo $10.50 elsewhere. This company is trying to rip you off and should not be an Amazon authorized seller!!!!!!!!!!!! Please kick them off Amazon."
1,poor for test 473,"I bought this book to study for the 473 exam along with another book. The tips are a few general test taking tips.This book has only 1 sample exam per test. The sample test is not identical to the test.They don't have proper time to study the memory chart only 3 minutes. It should be 3 then 5 minutes. The address checking has 5 errors in the answer key, that I found. It's coding section is poor, because you have to keep flipping back and forth to see the chart, because they were too cheap to do like the postal test and print it on each page with questions.Instead BUY THE OTHER STUDYGUIDE on Amazon I bought it is a dream. It is the ORIGINAL POSTAL EXAM 473 473C STUDYGUIDE by T.W. PARNELL"
4,Another solid arc in this great series,"Benis and Oeming's Powers is one of the best series out there today, dealing with cops who work on superhero-related crimes. Ruthlessly graphics, often funny, and always engaging, it's a must read for me whenever a new trade paperback is released.Forever is nice installment of the Powers series, adding the overall mythos these creators have built. Forever is a story arc that reveals who the main character, Christian Walker, truly is, while outlining a superhero rivalry that has gone on, well, forever. It does not rise to the level of the last tome, The Sellouts, but it does manage to be a good story of revenge and loss, adding new layers to an already great series. Recommended."
5,Graphic SF Reader,"A huge look into the past, and how there actually came to be Powers, and where Walker/Diamond came from. Oh yeah, and the monkey shagging that obtained some amusing criticism. Excellent work. Note that this is completely lacking in dialogue, at times, but for 2001 prehistoric type reasons.A mysterious monastery on a mountain, also features, with your inscrutable monk/lama type helping out those who find themselves in situations similar to Walker's."
2,Not good and expensive,This mix cost 7.99 on amazon and one still requires the (2) 8oz packages of cream cheese and 3 large eggs. The topping and cake were not good. Eli's cheesecake factory (Chicago) sells a low carb (edible) cheesecake in their store that is cheaper and taste much better. I really wanted to like this product and wish just one person had written a review. I followed the instructions given and the other person in my household would have rated it a 3 out of 5 for a low carb food. I give it two stars because at least dixie carb counters is trying to make us low carb food.
2,Poor quality printer,"I purchased my Canon S330 printer in late January of 2003. I used it to print the occasional shipping lable or report, no photos. The print head has failed three times in the past six months. First it stopped printing black right in the middle of a job(it suddenly started printing black again after about 3 weeks.) Then it stopped printing magenta, again, right in the middle of a job. As of January 2004 it stopped printing both black and magenta. After getting a run-around from customer service(telling me the standard ""do a cleaning, etc."")I was told I need a new print head, which will cost about $60 plus $40 ""labor"" to install at a ""certified Canon repair center"". Of course there isn't one near me and my printer would have to be shipped to one at my cost. It's cheaper for me to just buy a new printer. The only good things I can say about this printer is that it was fast and the ink is cheap."
2,Good printing when it works,"I've had this printer for not quite 2 years now and I've finally given up and ordered a different brand printer. The pictures are nice, when it's working. I've had the printer replaced once, it was the first time I had to replace the ink. For whatever reason the ink heads completely clogged and no ink could get through. The customer service was helpful, but I was disappointed to find that Epson has no toll free customer service phone number, so when you have an issue, you have to pay to call and get it fixed. However since they replaced it at no cost and very little hassle, that was only a minor inconvience. Now a year and a half later, after several mini-clogs (that wasting ink and running the cleaning program cleared up), it has again clogged - now I can only use the magenta and black ink. So rather than continue the fight with the clogging, I've decided to through in the towel."
1,Another junker from Epson,"I got this for free with a computer purchase. It printed beautiful pictures, but was noisy, clunky, and slow. It lasted 4 months before self destructing. Similiar experience as with an earlier Epson Stylus. Now I've ordered a Canon, should have done that in the first place."
1,Another broken C82,"I bought my C82 in 2/2003, Yesterday I changed the black print cartridge and black stopped working ran the nozzle cleaner utility and nothing. I changed each color and each one would quit working. Now the printer prints blank pages. I have ran the nozzle cleaner utility 15 times, talked to Epson and they said it could be the print head. I guess I got more use out of my Epson than other owners. Going to buy an HP next. The one I had before the C82 lasted eight years."
1,Review after a years use,for the first 12 months I can only praise the printer. Now the nozzle's are bloicked and it is not worth repairing. I have used it lightly and regularly over the past 12 months and having tried unblocking the jets through the cleaning utility it is still blocked I heading for the bin. As for me I am heading out to but an HP ink jet printer having had one for years and years with no problem.
2,Great until it dies,Works very well until it dies in under 18 months. Epson customer service is of no help after the warranty expires. I will not buy an Epson printer again - just purchased a Canon.
2,Cascading performance,"I adored this printer when I got it a just over a year ago. Then, all of a sudden, it just stopped printing. Apparently there is a glitch in this printer when it comes to the head cleaning process, it just won't work...Such a shame since it was doing it's job so well too..."
1,Constant Cloggin,"We had our printer for a year with no problems, but then the ink clogged and we had to send it in to get the entire printer replaced. Less than 3 months later the new printer clogged too and Epson says there is nothing they can do for us. Save your money and try a better printer with less clogging issues."
2,Get out your earplugs!,"I bought this model because the output looked good, and the rep in the store was printing a page, and it was so quiet! Little did I know it clunks like a Mack truck when it loads paper. I was replacing an older 740 because it was so loud when it prints, and I wanted to get individual cartridges, as it was annoying that the 740 would stop printing if one color ran out, but still had plenty ink left in the other two colors--even if you were printing a black text only item! A second problem is I like to turn everything on/off with one switch. The 740 would allow this (although the documentation said ""don't""), but the new C82 will NOT come back on when external power is applied, you must hit the on switch. My setup happens to have that switch in an awkward location. This was my fourth (and last) Epson--I was very disappointed."
3,Crap Epson C82,"I replaced a excellent cheap Epson Colour Stylus 400 with the C82. Black and white is good, pictures have good resolution. But photos all have a pink cast. I sent Epson sets of photos on different papers, plus a set printed through a photoprint service. Epson wouldn't admit there was a fault but did replace the printer. The replacement has exactly the same fault. This means the magenta runs out ahead of the other inks. The inks are fearfully expensive. I would think twice about buying another Epson product."
1,Defective Epson C82 (twice!),"In the past I've had good luck with Epson printers, but this time around was a real problem. The unit that was shipped to me was defective from the start and would not print. Period. Epson replaced it with a refurbished unit. (I thought I was buying a new unit! If I want refurbished, I'll buy it [elsewhere].) That unit was defective too, only printing black and cyan. I finally got my money back. Buy the HP 5550 instead!"
4,"Good value, fast printing","This printer is fairly nice for the money. It prints fast & clearly. We have four of them (three at work, one at home). They one bad thing (as I have also found with many other Epson printers) is that it feeds an extra piece of paper through the machine. I am not sure if this is a design flaw or what, but all 4 of our the C82 units do this. Other then that, this is a good printer. It is designed to use 3 color cartridges & one black. This seems to save on the cost of ink, although you seem to constantly be replacing the colored units. All in all, I am pleased with this printer."
1,garbage,"Printer worked great in the beginning. But after a few months the ink gets clogged and your printer is worthless. They say ""clean it 9 times"". that does nothing. Printer is worthless now, and i just bought all new ink (as they said that would fix the problem.. not telling me FIRST that the it may be clohgged and therefore unreparable). It's too bad, I really liked it when i first got it andDO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER. Going to HP now."
4,Sweet!!,"Whoa! This one is very different from the punk/pop/screamo T.O.C.S. From the very first song you can tell this is more of a Screamo only album. I loved the sound they brought to the table off of their previous release, but this album rocks way harder. It's SICK! For any other band 5 stars, but for the amazing Underoath 4 stars."
1,Horrifying,"How excited I was when I received this CD in the mail! How horrified I was when I put it in my CD player and pressed play! Despite all the pictures of John Wayne, Kim Darby, and Glen Campbell on the cover, this is NOT the True Grit soundtrack. It is instead ""Elmer Bernstein conducts Themes from his Original Score."" The difference: The true movie soundtrack is among the biggest, most booming western music ever recorded. This CD is some of the weakest, cheesiest 60's/70's orchestra music that has survived until now. The grand True Grit themes sound perverse mixed into music that would be more at home in Our Man Flint. The only redeeming quality of this CD is that the last track is the actual recording of the theme song that is used in the movie. If not for that, this album would be a total waste."
5,"Two words, True Grit","What can I say? It is my favorite movie. This soundtrack is great!I listen to it while using my treadmill. I listened to the soundtrack when I was a kid.....over and over and over....I'm still a John Wayne fan.When he died, an era died with him. If you love Western themes, this isa got to have. A little 70'ish but I love it."
5,this movie is amazing!!,"This movie was my favorite film of last year. My one regret when I saw it was that it closed the next day and I couldn't go back and see it again.The movie may have some disturbing elements for some viewers, so if you are easily disturbed or offended you should maybe pass. But anyone who truely loves film, especially independent film, I think will appreciate it. I had never seen a Franois Ozon movie before, but now I plan to see every single one. Natacha Régnier and Jérémie Rénier give two of the best performances that I have seen recently and should be commended. The movie has a great dark look and feel to it.I think one of the main reasons I loved this movie was because it was kind of daring. While sitting there watching it, I though of a direction that I would have liked it to take but said to myself that it wouldn't go like that. To my complete surprise it did and I found that rewarding."
3,Mediocre Printer,"The printer works quickly, but can be noisy. It provides good printed pages. The ink goes fast though. Even if you print with black ink only, the color ink cartridge is also consumed. If you end up with an empty color cartridge then you have to buy the color cartidge in order for the printer to work. Otherwise, it's a mediocre printer."
2,Would not recommend,I bought this printer two years ago and it seemed noisy and erratic from the beginning. The cartridges seemed to run out very fast and were quite expensive. Now I will be buying a new printer as it has a hardware problem that is not worth fixing.I would recommend spending the extra money for a better printer. You will avoid chasing good money after bad later on.
1,Disappointing Print Quality,"Several years ago, I owned an Epson 640 that worked wonderfully. I gave it up when I bought my new computer with USB ports. I upgraded to the C62. I was disappointed when I purchased the C62 and found the print quality so poor. The biggest problem is that the print heads clog quickly and leave smudges all over the paper. You can run that cleaning utility several times (which really uses up ink), but you'll only get one good copy out of it before the heads clog again. I have only had this printer a year and a half, but it has never had the print quality of the 640. I bailed on Epson and took a hand-me-down HP, 2 years old, that works so much better."
2,Feathered Phonics,"The CD is a great idea. I like how the tracks can easily be programed to repeat on a CD or DVD player. The birds do pick up on phrases quickly. However, tracks 67 through 75 appear missing. I'm a little surprised but just chalked it up to a bad CD until we played the OTHER teaching CD for the birds and it TOO is missing a handful of tracks. How Disappointing."
5,Jeanie massager works great,"I am a licensed massage therapist and am thrilled with the massager. It came yesterday (my birthday is today), and tried it out as soon as I got home from work and ate dinner. Fell asleep immediately! Have clients who can't wait to try it!"
5,Smells great kills mold!,"I love this spray, it's natural oils, smells good, and kills mold and keeps germs at bay. I recommend thieves oil and spray for anyone looking for natural alternatives to keeping your house clean."
2,The sprayer doesn't spray,"I have used this product in the past and was very pleased with it, but this particular one that I received is in defective packaging. It is in a spray bottle, but the sprayer won't spray, so I can't use it for what I wanted. Very disappointed."
1,Smashed merchandise,I recently ordered and received Epon To40120 Black Ink cartridge. When I opened the package the box was all smashed in and looks like it was run over. I think the cartridge is OK but will know more when I put it in the printer. I was going to buy color ink too but probably won't buy from this seller again if this is how their merchandise arrives.
3,dish network,"switch box allows for up to four recievers to be hooked up to on dish at the same time, and with the signal booster allows for long runs."
2,crappy,"Awesome bands, terrible quality. It might as well have been shot on a cell phone! Don't waste your time"
1,For IDE drives NOT SATA,"I received this product as an enclosure for an SATA drive I own. This enclosure will only accommodate IDE drives. Not SATA, as in the specifications on this page.Regardless of that, the construction is pretty cheap. I cannot comment on the performance."
1,cannot recommend,I bought this book for $1.00 at the used bookstore and it was overpriced at that. I normally like time travel stories but this one is not very good. It's dated and the writing is amateurish. Very unsatisfying but thankfully only 180 pages or so.
5,"""Must See"" is an Understatement.","I won't claim to profess a knowledge of finer films or of discreet actors or directors destined for greatness, like so many artists, only after suffering the humility of death. But I can say with confidence that this film is by far one of the finest, if not the very finest, I've ever had the pleasure to hold me so captive. The suspense was as bone-chilling as the plot, and the acting introduced me to a new level of excellence, the likes of which I thought died before I was born. Must see? Absolutely not. It's a must have."
3,The design is not accurate enough.,I received it very quick but it is so easy for the battery to fall off from the charger.Kind of disappointed.
3,Solid game,"This is the first football game I've purchased for my 360. Overall, I think it's a good game. The graphics are excellent. The play is remarkably easy (although I'm still getting used to the XBOX control after years of PlayStation controls). The games are great fun. I haven't played online yet, but I imagine that would add to the experience. However, like all EA football games I've played, the computer offense moves the ball WAY too easily against the defense. (I lost 73-66 last night in 8 minute quarters. Computer threw a 60-yard touchdown with 4 seconds left despite tacklers there ready to make plays.)My biggest problem with the game are the ""dynasty"" controls. I don't really understand that mode and there is only a brief description of it in the manual. Plus the menu is confusing. I still haven't found season stats yet.I thought I'd be set with this football game, but I may just buy Madden. Too bad there will be no NFL 2K7 being released."
3,Only good for die hard college football fans,"If you're a big college football fan, then I think you should definitly buy this game. It's got the college atmosphere in each big time stadium. The atmosphere isn't as good in the littler schools such as Idaho. In fact, the game doesn't even have Idaho's real stadium. Same goes for a lot of the stadiums. I'm also very dissapointed that there are no Division 1-AA schools. I really enjoyed having them at my disposel. EA just keeps getting more and more dissapointing."
3,WOW...,"I wasn't really impressed with the overall gameplay and it seems like they rushed it like Madden 06. The graphics are pretty good but the they look nothing like real life players (for ex. Kyle Wright QB, MIA, actually has blonde hair but on the game he has black) that's just attention to detail. It's a $70 game and the players don't even look like the real thing. EA thinks their slick with the stadiums, if you go to a Big Div 1 school they look identical to the real thing, but if you go to a smaller school they give you the same stadium for each, but just change the colors that the fans are wearing. I don't like the fact that there are no pre or post game video, it goes straight to the coin toss after a brief tour of the stadium. EA could've definately taken a little more time in perfecting this game. I have been buy NCAA football game for many years and have never seen one take this many bad reviews!! Unfortunately I dropped a pretty penny on this game and I will get my money's worth."
1,Other than the graphics this game really stinks compared to PS2 or original XBox version,"Bought a 360 jsut for this game. Been playing the NCAA games since it was Bill Walsh football on the Genesis. Well, I wanted to paly the best version and thbought newest platform would naturally have that, so I bought a 360 just for this game. What a waste of money. Not only does the game lack about half of the features of the PS2 version, it is 10$ more! What a ripoff. Other than the nice graphics game is not worth it!"
1,not worth it,"i love college football and i was telling all my friend that didn't get it last year to get it because it was a fun game. this years version of college for the 360 is straight ""GARBAGE"" a waste of time and money i waited up till midnight to get my copy of college football and i'm very disappionted. if the 360 is supposed to be the best gaming system out why did they take alot of thing out of the game for the 360. i loved race for the heisman last year, it's gone, the player celebrations after any play, it's gone, the players walking down the tunnel, gone, should i go on. maybe i need a job at e.a. testing games cause i wouldn't of never sent this game out to stores with all that stuff missing from the 360 version."
4,A more mature De La sound,"De La Soul are one of the top hip hop groups of all time. To be awarded that distinction you have to remain relevant in the game. They definitely did so with the release of Stakes is High in 1996. For someone who listens to a wide variety of hip hop I would put this sound somewhere between Common and the Pharcyde. Its definitely quite a ways from their whimsical, funky, uptempo debut 3 Feet High and Rising. The sound on Stakes is High is dense, jazz infused and the lyrics more mature and conscious. No more skits for these cats.I still prefer old De La but Stakes is High is definitely a solid album and their best sans Prince Paul. Highlights for me include the title track, Brakes, Long Island Degrees and the r&b; crossover hit 4 More ft. Zhane. You really can't go wrong adding this to your hip hop collection.Rating: 81/100"
5,Classic DeLaSoul joint from 1996.............,Great alternative to other 96 joints like All eyes on me and Reasonable Doubt. De La delivers as usual. Peace to the Plugs!Top Joints:Stake is High4 MoreDinninitItsowezeeSupa Emcees
4,Good,"I enjoyed this album. De la answered some of these so called cats disses. They also respond to those MC's who aint real, talking about they roll with drugs lords and other nonsense. This album has a true hip hop edge."
5,"If this is the bible, who is Arora?","As a beginning student of the wily mushroom, I saw this book at the elbow of almost every experienced hunter - even professors of mycology! Clearly a must-have. My use of the book is a work in progress, but the author's humor and fine general advice about mushrooming have already transformed my efforts from clueless bumbling to intermediate bumbling. I am actually making identifications of the more common prey. At least for me, this is a book to grow into - just what I was looking for!"
5,The Gospel According to David;-{),"The best treatment of West Coast mushrooms available today. Using Arora's concise descriptions, I have increased my knowledge of fungi with each foray. This is an enjoyable and informative text that is littered with fungi stories. When is the next edition arriving?"
4,"Huge!! Comprehensive, but has a few faults.","This book really gets into those fungi!! I got this book for my wife and I to use as our complete reference book on mushrooms. The book is a little intimidating because it gets so in-depth. And definitely lacks in good pictures. However, after reading a lot in this book you really start to learn a deeper side to those mysterious fungi. Great humor and candor mixed in throughout the book. The step by step ID section has been right-on in helping to identify mushrooms. There are quite a few I have been unable to identify if only I had a great picture of it! Some of the Step by step groups are so extensive its easy to get lost in them without ever finding your mushroom. By far the the most complete book on mushrooms I've seen but probably not for the total beginner. I will be looking for a companion to this one with more color pictures to help. Don't get me wrong, if you want to really get into mushrooms, or already are into them, this book is a must."
1,old adema was awesome,This CD sucks. Chavez made the band. I saw Adema twice in northern CA and they were awesome. I am going to miss their shows. This CD belongs next to the beer bottles in my trash can!-Metal Rules-
3,sounds like a broken record,"i know this probably sounds like a broken record with all of the other reviews saying how diffrent adema have become with their new singer, but seriously it isnt the old adema. the drummer hasn't really improved since unstable, the guitars are actually quite bad compared to unstable and their self titled album. the lead singer just really doesn't fit in with the whole sound of adema and to be honest it is a completely different band. i wouldn't even really listen to this band even if i hadnt heard any of adema's old stuff. this is just a low par CD that is a mixture between punk rock, pop and just that tiny hint of nu metal. it sounds almost a little like back into your system by saliva except without josey scotts powerful vocals. im going to stick to listening to the older adema and mourning over the loss of what was a great band. a disappointmentbest songs:Vikraphone 9/10Enter The Cage 8/10Barricades In Time 7/10"
1,Wow....Why Replace Mark?,"[...]I thought Adema kicked ass, but with out Mark as the lead singer, we got some whiney singer who sucks and doesnt even belong/fit in the group. The kid belongs in some emo/punk band.Oh yeah I forgot I'm rating the cd right....well my friend had a copy of it and I was like ""wow this is crap, turn it off"". I hate it when bands get rid of original singers...ARGGG..WHERED MARK GO!!!!!!!!!"
1,New Lead Singer Makes Me Sad,"I did not enjoy a single track on this cd. This group needs to get a new name, because it is NOT Adema anymore. Very dissappointed... I liked Adema because they were different, but now they sound like every other typical band."
3,"""adema"" needs a new name...","As sorry as I am to say this Adema isn't Adema anymore in any sense at all. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING is different it's extremely soft and mellow on every track, no screaming. I'm not saying this is a bad thing. Personally I liked Adema's old style and singer better, but I will agree that the new guy can sing better it's just not what I was looking for. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I think it's pretty good for what it is and it would be unfair for me to give it a bad rating when it really isn't my music preference. I just wanted to let everyone know that if you want Adema don't buy this. Listen to a few songs online with an open mind and don't expect the classic sound of Adema. My favorite track on this album is definately 2) Barricades In Time. But seriously guys change your name! You're deceiving fans..."
3,Not too bad but not Adema,It isn't that this music is bad but it isn't what you would expect from Adema. Their sound has completely changed so be sure to sample their new tracks before you purchase this album based off how much you liked their first two.
1,i AGREE WITH omg,"The vocalist makes a band, unless they die you should never remove your vocalist and keep the same band name its FALSE advertising. I loved Adema with Mark Chavez this new band sounds nothing like old ADEMA and the singer & the band don't sound like they belong together. The singer has a decent voice but not enough edge for hard rock and the band sounds like thay haven't practived in a while."
3,Honestly...,"Honestly the music isn't that bad, its just the fact that this is still called ADEMA that pisses us fans off. It is clearly not ADEMA anymore, not just because of the new singer, but the whole music experience is different in a whole. Not the nu-metal-ish type of thing they had going on before. They wanted to change completely it seems, which they did, but the name needed to change as well... Seems like they wanted to continue to use the title ADEMA simply to cash in on the name itself. What do you think would sell better, these 4 monkeys under a unknown name, or these 4 monkeys under ADEMA? Thats why they did it.If you can overlook (which is very hard) the fact that this is longer the ADEMA we knew and loved, you may like this new band. But honestly as good as the music may be or could be one day, its hard not to compare to past times."
4,Album is better if you don't expect Old Adema,"I have to admit I wasn't thrilled to find out that this album wasn't the Old Adema - Marky Chavez. But their first album was so amazing I figured there had to me more to them than just their lead singer. So I bought the album anyway, and kept telling myself not to expect Adema.The first time through I heard some promise, but was very disappointed with some of the vocals. Now that i've had a chance to adjust to the change, I actually really like the album. Most of the songs are good to quite good, and a couple are very good (Tornado & Better Living Through Chemistry).They probably should have changed their name - they are a totally different band - but if they had I never would have bought the album. So in the end, i'm better off because they didn't!If you're willing to try something new, I recomend this Album. If you're only looking for Chavez, google ""Midnight Panic""."
2,Disk's rec'd not as pictured,"Buyer beware the disk shown are 16x the disks I rec'd were 8x. I decided to keep and try them, only one disk worked out of all the ones I ordered. Now it's too late to return. I will think twice before ordering again."
5,Churches,Judith Dupre has clearly done extensive research for this book. The text goes far beyond giving us the basic facts about each church. Ms. Dupre explains the history of each church that she has selected for the book in a manner that makes us understand its unique significance. I noticed that she acknowledged church staff for providing relevant (and probably elsewhere unavailable) information. The book also includes an impressive collection of photographs.
2,I thought Jobes would be better,As any one knows palms need magnesium and These fertilizer sticks have none they are basically just for normal house plants.
2,Things You Either Hate or Love,"The book was okay but my main problem was the cover. One of the main concerns for Georgia is that she is ""overweight"" but the cover shows a girl who is in no way overweight. This plays right into the insecurities of teenage girls who will look at this cover and say to themselves, well if this represents what the public thinks as overweight then I REALLY need to lose weight. The story never really made a mark on me especially after seeing the cover and being irate at what is considered ""overweight."""
4,Worthy of a second look,"Despite the mixed reviews, I gave this movie a chance and ordered it a while back. Now, having seen it recently for the second time, I must say I really like this film. Its experimental qualities (face-to-camera narration, montage sequences, flashbacks, fade-to-black transitions) are more an homage to decades-past independent filmmaking than they are techniques to be taken totally seriously. What I like most about this film are the characters of Mark and Joey, who become sweetly endearing and lovable in their own off-beat sort of way. In the end, when Mark and Joey are at odds with themselves, while unwittingly trying to find their way back to each other (accompanied by a beautiful piano score, I might add), my heart longs for a satisfying ending and is not disappointed."
1,Not worth the frustration,"The print quality is good, but the paper keeps jamming and now mine is broke. I have not even had it a year. I've never been so frustrated with a printer as this one. Don't know if I will bother having it fixed, or if I will simply buy a new printer. What a waste."
4,Very pleased with My Photo Printer,I have had my photo printer for about 6 months now...Just recently I printed off some photos. I also had the same photos developed by Walmarts photo center. The photos that were printed out by my printer were better in color and quanlity then the ones that walmart developed. I recommend this product highly!! Thank you Epson.
3,Ink Hog and Printhead clogger,"This printer, I have had two of them, is an ink hog. Fortunately there are many firms supplying refilled cartridges or comaptibles for under $9. The problems lie in (1) the print head clogs (2) the printhead does not readily clean (3) you can't clean the black and color printheads separately or by color ... so you waste a lot of ink.When it prints, fine. When it is clooged, just buy a used one to reconditioned one to replace it"
1,Ink Guzzler,I'm constantly having to run the cleaning maintenance which sucks up ink (you have to waste both color and black inks even if only one is leaving gaps in your printouts). After multiple back-to-back cleanings it still leaves white lines. I give up after awhile and have my husband print things out for me at work. And the on-screen gauge of how much ink remains showed up once and never appeared again! It won't print black text if you're out of color ink and vice versa. I get very few prints out of each cartridge. The ink cartridges are very small besides being very wasteful.
1,Faulty print heads make this printer a money-pit!,"This printer is a joke! Sure, it prints good pictures - but the print head gets clogged so often that most of the ink in your ink cartridges is drained before you can do much! If you let this printer sit for a week, you will need to run the head cleaning utility - which drains a visible amount of ink on the ink monitor . Subsequently, you run out oif ink in less than two months without doing much printing at all! It's ridiculous!I bought ink cartridges three weeks ago, have printed nothing but a few resumes (no color) and now they are both halfway drained. Tell me, is this reasonable?I think not."
2,Ink Guzzler,The picture quality is OK but it guzzles ink. I also found that I have to clean the heads several times before each print session or I get little lines in the pictures. I am either going to buy a printer that is less expensive to operate or I will just take my memory card to a local photo dealer and use their machine and their ink. It would be cheaper and less aggravating
1,Could be more compatible,"This cover would not fit my 2"" receiver. The Curt cover is 2 5/8+"" on a diagonal, while my receiver is 2 9/16"" diagonal. This problem is due to the rounds in their cover being smaller than the fillets of my receiver.This cover is made of very brittle plastic, or it could have worked anyway. My old one was softer plastic and easier to fit.An accurate diagonal measurement would have helped rule this cover out."
3,Canon 530D,"Only convinient since you don't need a computer, just plugthe memory card or if you have a Canon Camera (not all Canon camera) and you can print the pictures.Not good quality picture at all, you still can see dots.Then I exchange for canon i850, this is much better and faster."
3,Ink eater!,"I've had this printer for about three months now and have printed about 20 pages total (not full color, not photographs). I am on my third set of cartridges already! In other words, after printing about ten pages (remember, not full color), I have to replace all the cartridges. I find the print quality to be quite good actually, but have never seen a printer eat through ink so quickly. Before buying a printer, I seriously suggest you look at the page output per cartridge."
3,Good while it lasted,"I bought this printer in mid-2003. It has worked very well for me. Unfortunately, it is now messing up like some of the others have described. The pictures look very dull. I've deep cleaned and changed all cartridges, but they still have a dullness to them. I have done a lot of printing on this machine over the past few years. I just wish that it would have lasted longer. I agree that it eats a lot of ink. I can't count how many cartridges I've gone through."
2,Canon S530D Review,This printer prints fast but the quality is poor. Consumer reports rates it a best buy but I disagree. Pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer. I do not recommend this printer to anyone. I bought the Cannon to replace a Hewlett Packard deskjet 932C and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the Cannon. This purchase was a real dissapointment.
2,Got God? Get Friends!,"The movie deals with an important topic (cults and people trapped within them). For me the treatment is unconvincing; I felt the actors were trying to act out something they heard about. The heroine's transition from cult to ""middle America"" seemed to require nothing more than a change of habit--the deep and often quiet power of a conviction never came through to me. The movie was as thin and moralizing as any Christian film, just with a different moral. Two stars for the subject."
1,Finding Moon,I enjoyed the plot. The book sent to my Kindle was full of grammar and spelling errors. I would not recomend this book with these errors.
2,Extremely Disappointing Compared to Hillerman's SW Series,"I thought this would be a well-written mystery, like Hillerman's Southwest stories, but I found the story line in this book ridiculous. It's as if he got started on a story about the recovery of the daughter of Moon's dead brother from a disintegrating Vietnam, and just had to force the story along no matter what. The cadence is wrong, and there are dozens of pages which go no where and add nothing to the story. And, who needs the high-moralizing? The final part, where Moon incredibly drives an abandoned armored vehicle from Vietnam into Cambodia during the child recovery operation defies even suspended belief. Good luck finishing this!"
3,This book is a good introdution to Data Warehousing.,I found the book to be well written. Its a good starting point for learning about DW. I would have liked to see some additional examples on the snowflake schema and some more details of performance issues.
1,"If you want to pass the exam, avoid this book","If you plan to take the Microsoft 70-019 exam, do not buy this book. It contains nothing but superficial information. It only skims on the major topics. No detailed explanation, especially on DTS. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,This book provides a basic overview of DW only.,This book is a good primer on data warehousing but provides little usable information specific to SQL Server 7. The greatest dissapointment is the lack of detailed information on MS DTS...the core utility for data warehousing with SQL Server 7.
4,Great Chair!!,"I received this chair in four days and I used standard ground shipping. Also, this chair is great for someone that works at an office all day, or has alot of tension in their back. Also, it is great on the legs as well! I would definitely recomend this chair if anyone is considering it! I am not sure if the woman with the first review just didn't pay or what happened with her shipment, but I just didn't want anyone else to be scared of not receiving their chair if they ordered it. I received it in 4 days."
4,massage chair,It is a great massage chair. It also does not take up to much space and it is light weight if you need to move it.
5,"Great ""How To""",I'm a beginner at this but I found this book to have really great instruction on how to do decoupage well plus all sorts of info on the tools of the trade such as scissors and glues and where to find images. It really had everything I needed to get started and actually make some pretty neat things (I decorated a gloass plate for my aunt and she was quite impressed) Lots of incredible sample works which were way over my head......someday I suppose I'll be able to do some like that! Pictures throughout are great & instructions are clear.
5,love this movie,"very touching, heartfelt movie about what it is to be a parent and how life sometimes is very unfair. one of my new favorite movies, even though its old it is still very relevant today. the beginning starts a little odd, but turns into a movie you will not forget!"
3,Between a rock and a hard place,"Based on Sue Miller's novel, this is about a somewhat frigid woman (Diane Keaton) who is raising her 8-year-old daughter using modern, open ideas. She then meets a man (Liam Neeson) who causes her own sexuality to blossom. But an ""incident"" occurs between Neeson and the daughter that filters back to the ex-husband who then fights Keaton for custody of the girl. Neeson is made out to be a sleazebucket at the trial, and Keaton sacrifices him in the attempt to win her daughter back. Of course Keaton's all-out battle to win her daughter back is admirable, and I suppose it is meant for us to think of her as a victim of a male-run society that is penalyzing her for her sudden sexual blossoming and openness in child rearing. I couldn't help, though, shedding a tear or two for Neeson, who is the sacrificial lamb here. Keaton's performance is typical, which for me is not saying very much: I don't care for her as an actress and find her overacting most of the time."
4,a little different,the first time i watched this movie it felt like forever. now watching it more and more it becomes better everytime i watch this movie. diane keaton looks so pretty in this movie and you can't help but kept your eyes in her. i didn't see the verdict coming out like it did and the ending wasn't that good but i couldn't imagen it being any different.
2,Obtuse,"I am note sure who this book was written for, except maybe for some young sociologist or other academic. Not useful."
3,You get what you pay for,"Remember how warm and comfortbale cotton flannel can be on a cold night? Well these sheets won't remind you of those days. The overall theme of these sheets is ""thin"" and ""cheap"". But what do you expect for the price? I would certainly recommend theme for Fido."
4,Beautiful gorgeous pictures,The book is packed with colorful photos which are rich in detail. I really enjoyed this book and it has become one of my favorites.
2,What's Up with Visioneer Products,"I'm frustrated with Visioneer's lack of quality testing of their software installation. They bill themselves as easy to use and install. I just utilized their ""tradeup"" program since their older 7620 model does not operate with Windows XP or Windows 2000 (a travesty in and of itself). They gave me a 25% discount to trade up to the 9020. Just tried to install but it indicates a dll is missing. I've now spent an hour attempting to find and install the missing dll. A visit to their website is now rivaling Microsoft's in it's complexity troubleshooting--an only offers M-F support. This is unconscionable for a major supplier of scanners."
2,Too Many Errors,"I tried for hours to set this scanner up. If Visioneer made this one-touch 9020 for exclusive use with Windows XP, then why are there so many errors when installing it? Check out Visioneer's support website for this product. It speaks for itself. If this doesn't work, try this; if that doesn't work, try something else. YIKES!! It may be easy to use once you get it set up but I never got that far. And, to add insult to injury, their tech support number is a long-distance call. Returned the 9020 and bought the new HP PSC 1210 all-in-one. I was scanning, copying, and printing literally within minutes. And, at $99, it is an incredible value."
2,generalist book,"I dont know, it had a lot of inserts by 'industry pros', but it is more of the same info everyone else writes. Good for the Mom or Dad of someone entering the field, but not much help to an actual artist. The book avoids actual tutorials and rewrites the basics from the software manual. However, it does put information into a smaller condense nugget than the software manual . . . but manuals are free with the software."
2,What happened to the intensity?,"I feverishly look forward to every new Rendel/Vine novel, but I was very disappointed with this one. What is so wonderful about her novels is the opportunity to be inside the head of someone with an off kilter view of reality. She has an uncanny understanding of the warped mind, and the reader is right there with her as the story unfolds. Unfortunately, in the Blood Doctor, we are a hundred and fifty years away from the warped mind. The story is being uncovered by the doctor's great grandson which creates a distance between the subject and the reader. Added to this, the doctor has deliberately destroyed evidence of what he was thinking and feeling at the time the story took place. This makes for a complete lack of immediacy.Instead of being inside the head of the doctor, something that would have been quite interesting, we are inside the head of his rather boring, though sweet, great grand son. All in all, not up to her usual excellent standards."
3,Be careful how you use this aid,"Repetetion is an excellent way to teach a parrot - IF there is also a visual, taste or sound stimulus with the word or phrase. Just hearing a word repeated over and over again begins to teach the bird - but what does the word mean? What is a cookie without the visual and taste stimulus?As instructed,I put my CD player on repeat to play a single track again and again. After five minutes the parrot was upset and started repeating, ""NO!"" Now when he hears the beginning of that song he whistles and says ""NO!"" African Grays are smart and blind repetetion wasn't the best way. Now I occasionally play the CD through and let him decide what he wants to repeat. One problem with the CD - all the audio tracks were not recorded at the same level and some tend to be much louder than other tracks.Would I buy it again - probably not."
2,Uncomfortable!,"I was suffering with severe groin pain during my pregnancy, so I purchased this belt hoping to find relief. I found this belt to be very uncomfortable. The elastic is so rough,it irritated me all day. Also the straps that go over your shoulders come up so high you are very limited on shirt options without the bands showing. Also, I had seen that it runs small and to order asize up, so I did. The band still cut into my lower ribs around my waist. By the end of the day I couldn't wait to take it off! I wore it once, then found a different support band and am much more comfortable now."
3,Not Really Worth It,"I only ended up using this a handful of times in my 6th & 7th months of pregnancy. It fit tightly (and I was just barely in the low end of the weight guide sizing wise), was extremely cumbersome to try to put on, was uncomfortable in the underbelly area, and dug into my lower back as well. I agree with the reviewer who said that it looks better on the computer screen than what it actually is in real life. If I had it to do all over again, I'd save my money and tough it out instead."
4,I'm glad I got this!,"I am 33 weeks pregnant and this has really helped me get through the day. I invested in a pair of good supportive shoes and even wear compression hose. But I was still feeling beat by mid day. I got this to help support my belly because my baby is low and all in front, lol. So far, I have worn this three days in a row. I don't feel so drained any more and it has helped with my back as well. I'm glad I got it."
1,Minimal support - not adjustable,The mini cradle is MUCH better - you can adjust the strap that goes around your waist/underbelly. This one is the size it is - mine is too loose and does very littls good. :-(
1,Don't buy this globe,"I bought it for my grandson for Christmas, from Costco. It worked great at first. Then we tried to use the USB and CD for updating. After that it would not work at all. I was glad I got it at Costco, because they have a great, easy return policy. But we were SO disappointed in the globe. My grandkids loved it as long as it worked, but it absolutely should not be hooked up to a computer, because the computer program is poorly done and the globe will never work again. I'll not buy anything by Oregon Scientific again."
4,Lots to like about it,"We bought this product for our 8 year old daughter. She loves it. Have not tried the internet update yet, but soon. One question I have, there is a light on the front right of the base of the globe. Never lights up. Will this change at some point?"
2,I dont know why this one stands out!?!?,i dont now what john howard is talking about perhaps australia got a dfferent relaese than the states because i took his advice thinking it was a slamin hardcore porn an it wasnt like most of the vivid series stuff its all softcore ... if you want to see jenna get double penetrated this is not the movie to see ...
5,Must read!,"Nien Cheng gave a vivid picture of how life was, during the Cultural Revolution, especially for a person with foreign links like her. She proved to us that with persistence, courage, we can overcome anything we set our mind to. I would also recommend is ""Son of the Revolution"" by Liang Heng who gave a ""Red Guard""'s point of view of the Cultural Revolution and also Jung Chang's ""Wild Swans""."
5,Life and Death in Shanghai,Very well written and gives a wonderful insight of what went on during those horrible years in China. Nien has a beautiful way of detailing her feelings and thoughts. One of the best books I've read.
5,A Woman to emulate,"I recently went to China for the first time in March, 2000, knowing little about its' politics (or anything else for that matter!). I wish I had read Nien Cheng's book prior to my visit. It is a book I will keep with me forever. She is the most courageous, true person I have ever encountered and moved me deeply with each sentence. If I were asked who, of anyone in the world, I would like to spend an afternoon with, Ms. Cheng would be my answer. A true inspiration in a difficult world. Thank you for the beautiful book."
2,Interesting insight,"Good insight into life under Mao, but the author is annoyingly self pitying and self agrandizing."
4,Life and Death in Shanghai Book Review,"Life and Death in Shanghai is an excellent memoir written by Nien Cheng that truly captures the extreme conditions of life in communist China during the late 1960's. As a woman wrongly accused and incarcerated for capitalist involvement, she describes her bitter experience with remarkable detail. The chapters were lengthy but filled with so much description. Her story draws the reader in with memories of harsh struggles and physical abuse ultimately behind national chaos. Throughout her autobiography, Cheng exposes the reader to the corruption practiced by the Chinese government and the injustice imposed on many of the Chinese citizens. Life and Death in Shanghai provides the reader with a certainly significant point of view and a lasting impression of life in communist China."
1,"poor research, the author really doesnt know what happened in Thailand","Actually, I would like to vote 0 star for this book, unless I have to give 1-5 star for it. The author showed his poor quality in this book.He does not understand what really happened in Thailand with his poor research.In Thailand, the king stands above the political issue, do not participate in any political activity. The corrupted governments have been chosen by (very) poor people (votes have been bought by using money, 80% of popultion in Thailand are poor) not by the king himself. The king is the one who can maintain the balance of power in Thailand. The king is the only one that the corrupted government can not win. PM Thaksin S. try to control all the things in Thailand by his power, but he couldn't do it until today, because he can not control The King."
1,Lot of mistakes and bias,"I was curious about this book so I tried my best to read it from beginning to the end. The problem was his researches were so plenty of mistakes. He refered to things with low credibility sources. I expected to use contents as references in my future works. But now I believed I shouldn't.Many of his statement fulled of bias. may be it's because of Far Eastern Economic Review problem with Thailand. I am really hate this kind stupid author who did things on his favor by destroying some others.If he has more evidences, then this will be a valuable research, but he hasn't."
1,Paul M. handley is the trash author for this story. Very liar,This book is very trash. Well education people will never read this kind of book. Because the author very uneducated and trash. If anyone can tell the author He is the trash author I will reward for sure Contact me at [...]
5,Desert Island Cookbook,"As my cookbook collection continues to grow, this book remains one of my favorites. It is a well written classy book that I personally admire. It is definately a book for foodies and not a quick reference for some quick dinner ideas.The recipes are very obviously real and tested and if one wishes to acheive the best results do not try to take shortcuts. As far as finding certain ingredients, there is a wealth of resources availible online and virtualy any ingredient that you can imagine can be found if you look."
4,"very interesting essays, but book limited in overall scope","This is a book that will be extremely useful for scholars (both established and aspiring) interested in learning about the latest historical developments in the study of selfhood/(auto)biography, medieval narrative, and sex and gender in medieval history--the three themes upon which this book focuses. Those who buy the book in the false hope that the book will present articles devoted to the full range of historiography in its field (i.e. not only cultural, but social, political, economic, and religious history, and so forth), like the other books in the excellent series to which it belongs (""Writing History""), will, however, be somewhat disappointed. The essays are quite good, but they deal entirely with the three themes mentioned above. So: I would indeed strongly recommend the book to those interested in these three particular themes, but those seeking a broader discussion of medieval historiography will need to look elsewhere."
3,"Interesting, but overpriced","I have had a chance to look at this book, which reads as if it were written for academia. By the time I got to the middle of the book I found that the author draws on a limited number of source materials over and over again, looking at the same information and stories from different perspectives. In terms of Sufi Sama, he references a very few schools of Sufism and gives a resultant limited review of the practice of Sama. (Although I realize he is talking about EARLY Sufi Sama.) For readers who were hoping to delve into the interface between neuropsychology, Sufism, trance states and Sama- this is most likely not the book you are looking for."
4,If you are a trance fan you'll like it...,"Personally, Storm's best song has to be Storm. Their other songs are good, but they fall short of ""Storm""s power and awesomeness. I have it and I listen to it a lot of the time, but if you're not into techno and trance, this might not be for you."
5,Community Service just keeps getting better and better!,"I purchased this cd the day it came out. If you like the first community service album, this one blows it away. There is not one slow track on this disk. TCM is coming through my town and I cannot wait to go see them! If you are a Doors fan, this CD is a must for their Roadhouse Blues Remix."
2,"For TCM, this is a really poor album","I absolutely loved their previous albums, especially ""Legion of Boom"". They went really wrong with this album, though. It's like some kind of aerobics CD - just a non-stop beat with no imagination. Their older stuff was much more creative and had rhythms that were awesome.I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 or zero because it's still The Crystal Method. But I really wish I could return the album, it's that bad to me. Be sure to listen to the sound clips to make sure it's what you want before you buy."
4,I like this,"The Crystal Method have become an elite force in techno music. My intro to them was many years ago. They are still going strong. They are from Los Angeles. They make me proud. Five years ago I got burned out on these remix CDs. There were just too many of them. But The Crystal Method have made the format interesting again. PMT ""Gyromancer"" is a great opening track. Most people will be digging ""The Crystal Method Vs. The Doors."" The LA ties are strong. Other tracks by Uberzone, New Order, UNKLE, and Smashing Pumpkins make this record unique and diverse. Most of these songs are remixed and tweaked. Most of the tunes are totally reworked. The music sounds like a totally new experience. ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" is a track that has rocked the dancefloor for almost twenty years. This new Hyper Mix is solid. The Crystal Method rules. They are pure genius."
3,The Sound of Music: The Making of America's Favorite Movie,"I bought this book prior to my recent trip to Salzburg, Austria. I found it very informative, and well written and certainly helped me in my quest to locate the various filming locations from the movie in Salzburg. There are some great behind the scenes photos, and excellent details about the actual production of the movie.Any fan of The Sound of Music would thoroughly enjoy this book."
5,An advent tradition,My children and I enjoy reading this one chapter a day throughout advent. It has become quite a tradition in our family. The two stories intertwined along with the lovely illustrations make this a treasure!
4,Works and cheap,Gets the job done and like the dc adaptor as well. Not much else to say other than I'm satisfied with the charger and has easily been a solid and quality charger.
2,OK but it may be staged and not as good as Reverse Telemarketer Prankster,"So I got this because I heard those underground recordings circulating on reverse prank calls on telemarketer and thought this was it. Tom Mabe is ok but I agree with some of the reviews that this might be staged. The idea is great though and thumbs up on that. I finally found the real deal on iTunes! Do a search on ""Telemarketer"" and look for ""Reverse Telemarketer Pranksters."" These are what we listened to on a road trip skiing and it was the funniest thing I'd heard in a long time. They are completely insane and I swear they are just trying to keep them on the phone as long as they can. They never answer a single question."
2,Romantic-comedy not comedy,this movie was terrible. I could hardly get through the entire thing. It was clearly a mistake even bothering to film it. The only reason i didn't give it one star is because I like Bob Hoskins. I do not recomend this movie to anyone.
3,Good for someone who is actually learning the language.,"This book is very compact and basically organized, however, for my week in France I really only needed to know about 10 key phrases. I wasn't able to use the book to talk to anyone, (no one has patience for that) I just used the book to master a few phrases leaving about 90% of the book unused. This book might have come in handy in a pinch if I had to communicate a lot with someone in French, but I didn't have to.One more thing: it is imperetive that travelors learn key phrases in the language of the people were you are visiting. It will make your trip a lot smoother and frankly could help you avoid conflict. Learn to say ""excuse me"", ""water"", ""Thank You"", ""Where"", ""WC/Toilet"" and so forth."
2,CD is not useful,"The phrasebook is pretty good, but the audio CD is not useful. I expected to hear the phrase in English, then in French, perhaps repeated a second time so that I could practice saying the phrase too. Instead the phrase is spoken only once, in French, with such a brief pause before the next phrase that there is not time for me to repeat it. The spoken phrases are listed in the book, but not in the same order, so it is not practical to follow along in the book to get the English translation. Basically it is a recording of a guy speaking random French phrases, and I don't know what they mean. Very disappointed customer..."
4,French Booklet,"Its OK, I didn't use it too much. Everyone speaks English. Would have been more helpful if I'd went into the more rural parts."
3,"Meh, Compared to ""These is My Words""","I loved the first book, ""These is My Words"", and on that basis alone, I purchased ""Sarah's Quilt"" and ""The Star Garden"". SQ is well-written, however the storyline is so boring and dragged out and all over the place. Whatever can happen - does. Sarah's indecision about certain things and her ""self-inflicted ignorance"" of certain people's characters etc. really irritates me. I found myself skimming over paragraphs at a time that seemed to go nowhere.Granted, this book does give a cool look into how life was lived during that time and in that area. I'm looking for a novel, though. I was so impressed with the first one so this one is a big disappointed. I'm not even going to finish it at this point (I'm on page 278 out of 402).The big question is whether to bother starting ""The Star Garden""."
3,The inspiration left long ago,"Quite frankly, the magic was over after Sarah's amazing husband died in the first book. The next few books were just jam packed with unrealistic action. No more captivating love story... even if that was a bit unrealistic too. Nancy's inspirational juices ran out after the first one."
5,Sarah's Quilt: A Novel of Sarah Agnes Prine,"I couldn't put this book down. An amazing story! Be sure to read These Is My Words, first. It is the beginning of Sarah's story."
5,Great historical novel.,"We are in the Tucson, Arizona area for the winter and this is a wonderful history of this area in the early 1900's, 1906 to be exact. So accurate on the climate and trials here. A great read."
5,A very useful tool to have,"I was really looking forward to owning one of these and it did not disappoint me at all. The light is bright enough and so is the beam. I had bought it for camping and it served me well. I love the fact that it comes in a little case so that if I do not want to add it to a key chain, I will not have trouble finding it in my bag or purse."
5,Great when out and about at night.,"This compact unit is great to carry with you at all times, even hooks to your car keys so no more problems unlocking the car at night. Everyone should have one of these."
4,"Wonderful mouse -- left button stopped working, though ...","I bought the mouse as a part of a duo and I loved it. Comfortable and all that jazz. It worked fine for a year or two, but then the base started to act up. I have to position it a certain was by lodging a wire in to make it charge and just recently, the left button stopped responding. (I blame myself, I highlight all day and click everywhere.)I'm looking for another mouse, but I wouldn't buy it alone. I'd rather get the duo 'cause the keyboard is really worth the money.Logitech Cordless Desktop MX 5000 Laser (967558-0403)Oh well, there must be another logitech mouse out there for me..."
3,Love at first click,"I've had my mx1000 for maybe a year now, and it's been wonderful.I have small hands so it took some adjusting to the big size, but when I finally adjusted things were lovely.The problem is that in the last couple days my mouse started double clicking instead of single clicking about 60% of the time. It's driving me mad and causes me to get temporary bans on sites that have protection enabled against this type of spam.This is a terrible thing and I will have to replace my mouse. This really upsets me because this mouse is expensive and I will not buy another, but now I have to adjust to something less lovely (before it breaks).Bah Humbug."
4,Best tracking ability. Remapping software works.,"Just for a fun I tried this thing on a scratch-free CD case. It just worked. Impressing.Also the software for Windows is not bad. You can map any key to 8 buttons out of 10 if you want (right and left buttons are not configurable, which is understandable).I don't use side-scrolls much, so I reconfigured side-scroll buttons to forward and back.I also remapped forward, back and application buttons to F9, F10 and F11 because I use these keys frequently and my keyboard has these keys in weird positions. Perfect setting for your Visual C++ debugging session.I would have prefered BlueTooth version, though, and that's the only reason I gave this wonderful thing 4 stars."
2,Bummed...,"It may have better tracking but you won't notice it. It feels like a brick in my hand. You can't successfuly negotiate finite mouse movements when your mouse weighs a ton. My $19 Logitech optical wheel mouse is far easier for the hand and I honestly can't tell the differece in tracking. The forward and backward buttons don't work in all browsers (I use Avant), and the up scroll button doesn't click to acknowlegde the command and yet the down scroll does. The only good thing I can say about this product is the ergonomic design."
2,its ok,"It worked and did its job. However, the mouse had problems sitting in the charging cradle; I would all ways have to play around to get it to charge. Though, my LAN buddies also had this mouse but did not have this issue."
4,Cordless Mouse,"This mouse is fantastic. I bought 3 of them for use on my Macs. It has been flawless & a great time saver. Everyone loves them. My only Complaint is Logitech had a rebate on these & they never sent me my money. They sent me a postcard telling me I didn't send them the correct box bar codes. I sent them the only ones on the box. So, Logitech screwed me 3 time. The mouse is good, but Logitech sucks!"
4,Good mouse but base too large,"I originally got this for a laptop-- and I thought that the base would be small and portable-- like a USB key or something. But it was huge. So I can't really use it like I thought for a travel mouse-- Otherwise its a great accurate mouse. I love the fact that it has so many buttons that you can program. I dont like how in the new Logitech software, they removed ""Recall Application"" as one of the mouse assignments you could do-- I liked that feature."
3,"If you own a MAC, beware!","The product description says this mouse is ""Compatible with Windows or Macintosh computers"". It is if you can find the software for Macs, because IT DOES NOT COME WITH THE MOUSE. I got one for my daughter and she had to go to the Logitech web site and search for and download software for it.I have a PC myself and I love this mouse, but it would be nice if the software disc had the MAC software on it also. Also, some of the settings available on the PC software for the mouse are not available for MAC, or are different. She still likes it, but if you own a MAC, be aware of the shortcomings of this product in the MAC environment.p.s. If you use the Firefox browser and want to use forward and back buttons, you have to program the buttons with KEYSTROKES, (alt+left arrow and alt+right arrow)."
1,WOBBLES,"The mouse itself is great, but there are a lot of them going around that do not lay flat on a surface. I got one of them sent to me from Amazon. This is clearly a defect that Logitech has acknowledged, but for some reason they are still being sold."
2,Defective Product,"My office recently purchased three of these and they turned out to be defective. The problem that another reviewer mentioned ""Great until it broke"" started from day one.The pointer would jump all over the screen and act as though it was ""drunk"" going everywhere as though it couldn't stop. It took our IT guy a long time until he finally called Logitech who very cautiously admitted they were defective.Logitech wouldn't take them back because they said we purchased them through Dell along with our new computers.Too bad, because the functions the mouse offers is amazing."
3,Not thrilled,"I bought this after accidentally dropping and destroying my one-button Apple wireless mouse. It seemed like a good idea at the time. But all that the supposed ergonomic swoops and curves of this thing do is force my hand into an uncomfortable position ... prolonged use leads to aches and pains that I never had before. The mouse is officially ""wireless"" but you still need to plug the recharger into a USB port. So you've still got wires, which is a disappointment for those of you (like me) who hoped to get rid of all that garbage with a Bluetooth Mac. It's nice to have a scroll wheel, but other than that I'd rather be using my old one-button Apple wireless mouse."
3,Only if you have small hands...,"I purchased this mouse in 2006, so I've had plenty of time to play with it. I at first thought it was comfortable, but have since changed my mind. The wheel is too far up the mouse, so you have to move your hand up in order to use it. Also, shortly after I got it, said wheel lost its click-sensitivity, so I now have to press very hard in order for the wheel click to register. Not so good if you want to stay away from repetitive stress injuries.Finally, the laser's sensitivity is surprisingly inaccurate for finer movements, but works well for just dragging your cursor around.The rechargeable battery life is quite decent, and the wireless range seems to be pretty good.But all in all, I think it would be far better for people with small hands."
4,"Not Spiderman, but Good Twist","Spiderman as a father? And his offspring is a daughter? Can a father be more protective? An interesting twist on the popular Spiderman comic books and now movies, Spider-Girl is a logical sequel for the next generation crowd. Like Spiderman, she has all the powers, and like Spiderman, she has all his problems, too - including his old enemies. Maybe this may get more girls to read comics, graphic novels, or books about strong superheroines, but maybe it may cause diehard Spiderman fans who want to see Spiderman forever youthful without a child to cringe. Nevertheless, with few really good superheroines out there besides Wonder Woman, Buffy, Queen B Superheroine, or Elektra, Spiderman's daughter may just catch on."
1,Not Even Close,"I bought this thinking I would get an easy close shave. That's not the case.Pros:-Nice Design.-Nice Idea.-No redness or unsightly red bumps after use.Cons:-The charger is poorly designed-The battery life indicator is never accurate. It'll go from orange to red in 2 seconds after charging to full, but run on the red setting for a long time.-Too much work and a learning curve to actually shave.-Only gives you a close shave half of the time.-Pop-up bikini trimmer doesn't work.So in short save your money and buy a better electric shaver."
4,If you have to choose...,"between Ingredients 1 and 2, go for the second installment of this new series from producer and dj LTJ Bukem. While both compilations feature tracks by the same stable of dj's, Ingredients 2 is slightly more chilled down and interesting - these tunes flirt heavily with the structure and range of instrumental acid jazz and seem less sterile and processed as a result. Ingredients 1 is what you'd put on as background muzak when your friends come over for cocktails; Ingredients 2 is what you'd actually listen to on your headphones. Neither record is particularly groundbreaking but since that evidently wasn't the goal when they were made, I'm not complaining. Oh, and good cover art, no?"
1,"Don't Buy This Unless You Own ""Baking for Dummies""...","Because there are clearly unspoken steps to these recipes that will thwart beginners' efforts.I like to bake. I don't know HOW to bake, but I like it just the same. So when I get in that culinary mood, I rely on a recipe to guide me through the process, start to finish. When trying something new, I do no more or less than what is written down.And there's the problem with this book. I have already tried four of its recipes, and three of them were awful. The fourth, while edible, was nothing special. So I am giving up and going back to Betty Crocker."
5,serving in silence: the Margarethe Cammermeyer Story,"Having been in a similar situation, I know how it goes. The story rings true only for the military officers...enlisted on the other hand go thru alot more turmoil and harrassment. GlennClose did a wonderful job on this, as she always does."
2,Don't recommend,Absolutely not what I expected from them very cheap scent. Previous red and blue labels were nicely done.
2,Not good,"you can tell they had a good idea with what they wanted to pull off. and every other givenchy scent ive ever smelled, has been at least better than average. pi and pi neo are great IMO.but the desire didnt translate and this fragrance is pretty much a flop. ive had my nose over much worse, but i wouldnt buy this. however, it doesnt smell cheap."
1,Missed the mark,I don't usually read a book that I don't like . It claimed to give a biblical understanding of dreams. I disagree. I say a lot of personal interpertation very little from the Bible. This one I would not reccommend to anyone.
1,Shipper Error,"The wrong set was sent. Although the invoice contained the correct model number, the box clearly identified the included set as a passage lock rather than the privacy lock I ordered. Additionally, the handle was dented. The denting may have happened during transit, but I was unable to determine this with an certainty."
5,Very Comfortable,My wife wanted a confortable bra to wear both while sleeping and going out and about. We searched all the different types of bras and she decided to try this one. From the description it looked to be confortable and has not dissapointed her.
1,Don't buy if you are larger than an A cup,"The description states that it fits B or C cups, which is incorrect.I am a 34 B and this bra is so tiny that it might as well be classified as a training bra.No one larger than a A cup is going to be comfortable in this bra unless they like to have their breasts flattened!I am in the process of returning this item right now!"
1,Simple Solution Male Wrap,"The information on Amazon and what I received do not match. The picture on Amazon show the product with a wider sadle on the dog which I thought would help with bunching. What I got is like any other belly band for a male dog. Did not have adjustable closure, it is velco and the width of the band is the same all around so it will bunch up on my pug as he moves around. I got the same product from Top Paw and was looking for something different. I would not have paid the $13.95 for one band if it was like what I already had. Wal-Mart carries them for $9.95.The band does work, but you need several for a dog who has problems with marking and some time there are accidents since the band with bunch up in the middle.[[ASIN:B000FJD5ZS Simple Solution Washable Male Wrap, Medium]"
2,Simple Solutions male wrap XL not so great,I have two dogs in diapers. My little guy doesn't mind the wrap at all. My large dog hates his. The large size has a hole for the tail. I never would have purchased the XL wrap if I had known it was fitted with a tail hole.It slips off my old boy's rump and is hard to keep on. The little guy's wrap is perfect. Wished they had left the design alone.
2,Disappointed,Only lasted for 3 washings before the elastic gave out on one side. If it had lasted would have preferred to use this brand for its light weight.
3,Runs really small,My sister and I both have one of these - hers is a very small dog and mine is a small/medium dog. She got the small band and I got the medium and neither of us can use them though the dogs are within the weight range. It's not a bad product but you definitely need to buy a size up! I don't care for the elastic on the outside edges as it seems to be a bit tight. I have a different belly band that is fleece and doesn't have the elastic - I prefer it b/c it just seems more comfortable for our dog!
1,too big,this wrap was way too big for my 80 pound lab. the playapup belly bands fit & work much better.
3,It's alright.. but looks VERY uncomfortable.,"I have a big Chihuahua mix that I bought this for. All in all, it does do the job because he marks everywhere and it's so obnoxious, but it looks extremely uncomfortable. His chest is pretty big in comparison to his waist, so it bunches and looks like it's squishing his ""parts"" because the elastic is very strong. He sometimes whines or snaps at me when I try to adjust it, so I'm pretty sure it hurts him."
3,Pearson's diaper,"I purchased the washable male wrap for my 15 year old cocker spaniel. I had noticed that when he went to sleep he would dribble urine. I asked my vet for suggestions, and he suggested that I purchase a belly band. I got one (sz small) at WalMart (that was the only size they had). It was too tight. I then got a medium at the local pet store and was advised to use a feminine pad with it. This worked well, so I went on line to try to find a couple more at a more reasonable price (the pet store charged around $20). I found the same product on Amazon and ordered two. They are working well, but the medium is a little too big. There is a big difference between the small size and the medium size. The good news is that I no longer have to clean up the urine spots on the rug."
4,Great product!,"Fits wonderfully and works great with a maxi pad. Would not recommend using it without one, as it doesn't absorb large amounts of urine. Soft t-shirt material comfortable to wear and doesn't cause sores from daily use. Stays in place. Heavy-duty Velcro. Outlasted other brands I have had in the past. Recommend having several at your disposal for the leg-lifter in your life."
4,wrap,"The wrap is good , although I bought an extra large. Should have been large. My dog takes it off. It is not the wrap's fault. Should be more absorbent."
3,watch for irritations!,"product was as described and when used with pad did not need daily washing. I did find that when I used this belt on a daily basis my dog developed a ""hot spot""that he kept worrying and licking until he made a raw spot and big hair ball in the area. When I stopped using the belt and used gauze with a pad inside he recovered and seemed much more comfortable. Sometimes mothers home remedies are best after all! RJ in SF"
5,Simple solutions,The shipping was super fast and exactly as described...our older dog doesn't mind wearing them at all and the material washes and drys really well.
2,All over the place,"This is my first Rudy Rucker book, and I guess he's not for me. Lots of wacky things happen from chapter to chapter, but it would be nice if there was a plot that I cared about. It just felt very haphazard."
4,Only one concern about this musical tour de force,"Easily Khia's greatest work, this song takes its rightful place next to the likes of Bob Dylan's ""Like a Rolling Stone,"" The Who's ""My Generation,"" Springsteen's ""Thunder Road,"" and Right Said Fred's ""I'm Too Sexy."" Its rich melodies and intricate storytelling and sound play will haunt our ears for generations. Yet I'm at a loss to explain this urban poet's negligence when it comes to her health and that of her fans: Each listener will have to decide for him/herself whether the UTIs and other bacterial mayhem likely to result from her exhortation to ""roll your tongue from the crack back to the front"" are too high of a price to pay for what is, admittedly, a musical tour de force of the sort seen only once or twice in a generation."
3,For new Mary fans only,"I hate to say it because Mary's my favorite singer, but you can for the most part bypass this purchase.Don't get it twisted though! There are no bad songs on this album.I think a lot of fans were (prematurely) expecting a greatest hits compilation when it fact this was always advertised as a Mary album with just four new songs.Speaking of which, if you do decide to buy this album, do it for the lone classic new song on here : Mary's duet with John Legend on ""King & Queen.""Wasn't really feeling any of the other new joints.And as far as ""greatest hits,"" like I said, if you were into Mary in the 1990s, all of her masterpieces are missing for the most part.But then again if you a true Mary fan, you already own them.Again, this isn't an essential Mary album but all the songs are high quality."
5,The Trench War Reviled,"A well written book, easy to grasp and very informative. The horrors of the trench war are well described. One of the best books on the subject!"
3,It's Ok for a start.,"Buffie the Body, the big booty phenomenon creates her own video which is somewhat about a day in the life of what she does. Well the parts about the magazine shoot is pretty good, some of the audio and video needs work, especially the scenes of her hosting a party. The booty clap scene was the bomb!!! But overall, she does have it going on. I just hope the next video she creates will be much better and more professional polished than this one."
2,overpriced,"This book is very overpriced. Half of the tricks are things that are obvious, like push polling or sending anonymous negative information to a reporter (like someone would reveal their name about that). The other half are collegiate tricks, like ordering a campaign a lot of pizza or if you're at a debate where you both have water, filling their pitcher so it might spill on themselves.I bought this because I was curious of what went on in campaigns, but after reading it in 20 minutes I was left wondering if the author really used any of these or was involved in any campaigns.I would have paid $1.50 for this book perhaps, as for a little kiddie comic book."
1,less functional than the original socket it replaced,"Cartridges fit into this socket very loosely and after an hour's worth of fiddling I still had not been able to load a game in a playable state, so I replaced it with the original which I can at least get to work.it's not worth my time to try and get a refund. im just going to buy another one from a more reputable dealer outside of amazon. annoyed."
3,"It works, mostly.","The 72 pin connector received through this seller was a bit loose compared to the one that I previously had installed. On the upside, this means that the pins won't get bent back into the frame like the old one. On the downside, some games take quite a bit of canoodling to get playing, and those stubborn games will sometimes freeze up during gameplay. This accounts for about 20% of my collection, and unfortunately includes my copy of Mega Man 2. Also, the pins weren't gold plates on mine, meaning that it could become corroded fairly quickly.The price was right for this connector. Most games work. If you want something foolproof though, look to spend a few more dollars."
5,My favorite Nabokov,"Having read many Nabokov books, this is by far my favorite. It is simply delicious. It starts with a catchy line, and Nabokov never hides from the reader that the main character will have a bad ending. Cynical and well written, this book sometimes reminds me of Balzac's Eugene Grandet because of the perfection in the choice of words. If you see through his cynicism, you will find this book funny and enjoyable as well."
4,to the far blue mountains,"I thought that this was a very good and exciting book. I think that Louis L'Amour's books are good for all ages. The charactors that he created for this book seemed like that they fitted with every thing this book had to offer. I felt like that i could picture every moment that i read, where they were in that particular place and time. One of the other reasons i liked this book was because, i get really interested in books that deal with the wilderness and people trying to tame it without the upper hand, and without the resources that people use now in everyday life. I gusse the readson for this is because I'm a hunter, and i know how difficult it can be trying to do something without the basic necessities that you are used to. i feel that this is a great book, and i recamend it to anybody that likes adventure and drama."
4,A good second part of a trilogy....,"But not awesome, as most Nora trilogies are! I like Roz and Mitch, and it is wonderful to read about a couple who is more mature. But some of it felt forced and just too ""convenient""...the only two characters in the series over 40 and whoa! big shock! they fall in love. The ghose stuff is great, and VERY unfinished, so I can't wait for Red Lily to find out how Amelia gets ""exorcised"". Also, I am thinking that the ""passion"" in Red Lily may be higher because the readers know that Roz's son and the unwed mother who works for her have been secretly lusting for each other for two books now!"
1,Black Rose,"I never received this book. How complicated is it to put a paperback in an envelope, put that address and postage on it and put it in the mail. I won't use this system again or will purchase from Borders."
5,Black Rose,This second book of In The Garden is excellent. I can not wait until the 3rd book is released.
5,Love this main character so much !,"The second book in the In the Garden Trilogy. Black Rose is wonderful. I love Roz,the main character in this book. She is a middle aged, no nonsense, tough lady who grew up with money but knows how to work work work ! Just like book 1, with Stella, Roz transforms and finds out what she wants and who she is by the end of the book. Again, the ghost in the mansion is getting nasty and all of these characters work together so well and help one another in trying to figure out who and why the ghost haunts them. Combining love, mystery, the paranormal, action, tranformation, romance etc...is Robert's gift. A great book."
5,Spiritual Depth and Practical Teaching,Pat Kirk brings together a touching story combining spiritual depth and brilliant use of metaphor. I smile every time I read the book and my kids love it! I recommend buying the entire series.
2,Pictures not very connected to text,"When I first got this book, I looked through all the pages, and there was a colour picture at least once every few pages - and many came from famous ILM films such as Jurrasic Park. I looked forward to reading about how these images were lit or rendered or composited -- but (sadly) the text had very little if anything to say about the specific shots, the images often were a tangent to the main topic of the text, where it seemed as if it were a stretch to work in a mention of the image. I don't blaim the companies for wanting to keep everything about their work a secret, but without any specifics the general discussions in this book were essentially unillustrated and not very useful. I wish they would publish a more technical and specific book about lighting and rendering and compositing for visual-effects film-making!"
4,Great for every CG artist,"This book is not tutorial based, and although many may say that it goes over the basics, its actually more of a personal enrichment process. Don't buy this book if you're a newbie and are just looking for tutorials to carry out. This book serves to make you wiser in the CG career and understand how things work, great reading material.My only crit is that I don't like the horizontal style of the book, when you're sitting down to read it, its a pain because its so wide! I would have very much preffered a vertical book as this one being horizontal makes it easy for the covers to bend permanently, which is not pretty if you like to take good care of your books like I do."
1,Wasn't What I Expected,I was very upset when I started to listen to this CD. I had no idea it was a remix version. I thought this was the original version of the song.
4,"Great Cooker, But...","I too purchased this cooker from Fry's in 2007 and it does a great job of cooking rice. My use is about 3 cups (dry) each week. I cook only Basmati Brown Rice and it comes out perfect 100% of the time. My only complaint is that the fluoride coating of the inner pan has bubbled and delaminated from the aluminum surface after about 18 months of use. I wipe the pan with a washcloth for cleaning and have never had anything abrasive inside the pan except the rice and the plastic paddle that comes with the unit. I see from other appliance forums that this is a common problem. So if you can overlook the pealing coating, this is an otherwise good product."
2,Not as good as I expected,"I was hoping as many years as the author has been in business that she would have published a better book with more innovative patterns with better designs and more handpainted yarns. If I had it to do over again, I would not buy this book."
1,So glad I DIDN'T buy it.,"I'm so happy I decided to check this out from my public library prior to spending cold hard cash on it. While the instructions were good and visually oriented, I couldn't stand the author. She celebrity name-drops at every opportunity, and I really could care less which big name confided her pregnancy to the author prior to letting the public know! This was supposed to be a knitting book, not a gossip rag."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is one of the most disappointing knitting books I've come across. Most of the book is spent teaching the beginner how to knit, which I have no qualms with, except to say that there are tons of books out there that do that and do it better. There are only a few patterns in the book, none of which are original and all of which are, frankly, unattractive. There are 2 multicolor ponchos which use a variety of yarn types, but the colors used are hideous. Even when trying a project like this using leftover yarn from your stash, most of us would try to pick yarns that complement each other. The worst part of the book though is the constant name-dropping for name-dropping's sake. In many cases, the entire point of Eig's anecdotes are tell the readers how close she is with the stars. If you like the Hollywood angle, try Hollywood Knits Style by Suss Cousins for patterns that are more original."
5,The Greatest Therapeutic Tool: The Gift of Forgiveness,"The enormous impact of this book on the ability of individuals to forgive has made it one of my most treasured tools for friends who are in turmoil with their feelings of betrayal and/or abandonment by those they loved.Beautifully illustrated, simple and yet profound, I highly recommend this loving and lovely work for both adults and children who are struggling to find an understanding that can lead to their own release from the past."
5,Wonderful Storybook,"The Little Soul and the Sun is a wonderful book full of beautiful pictures that displays in language so easy a child could understand it, that our mission on Earth is to forgive one another."
5,Safari Chic is Chic,"Bibi Jordan has managed to capture the true spirit of adventure in her new book Safari Chic. Not only do the wild exteriors and the mannered interiors inspire one to redecorate their physical surroundings but they resonate with the kindling spirit of rejuvenation and imagination. This is a traveler's delight as well. More books Bibi, more!"
3,"Not a bad book, but I wonder if it will help with GW-CNE...","For starters, when I purchased this book, I was concerned about the publisher. Sybex has not had a good track record with me and their computer books. I'm a CNE, and I'm working on my MCNE. The book is excellent if you are after a good admin guide for GW 5.2 systems. However, I am worried that when I take the GW-Admin exam from Novell that I will not do so well. Time will tell, however I had to buy a different book than Sybex's when I was studying for my CNE..."
1,meditation,there are much better books on meditation than this one.i hope newcomers to meditating won't be discouraged if this is the book they choose.longtimers won't find it to be much help either.(imho)
4,Great CD player!,"Love this thing to death! It has great bass, great volume, and it can shuffle too. Its not a hassle to use either, just stick in a CD and press play! I've dropped this thing loads of times and it doesn't skip at all- and the headphones are great too. The only thing bad about this is the clasp which which broke off mine (but a rubber band can hold it together. xD ), but I don't blame it- it was a hard fall! I paid 50 dollars about two years ago for this, a bit much- but there are pretty decent prices nowadays for this thing."
4,Excuse me?,"So finally there is an illustrated book about the National Revolutionary Army of the Republic of China... and the cover is of a Japanese soldier sticking his bayonet up some poor Nationalist soldier who promptly surrenders, all while someone dressed in Communist garb calmly watches on. If this image was chosen as the cover I can imagine what goes on inside... I'm sure there's nothing about the defence of Sihang Warehouse, Battle of Shanghai, Operation Ichigo, and the various battles that took place. Instead it is most likely filled with pictures conveying pretty much the same thing the cover does.That being said, nobody has even bothered to do a book like this before, so a BIG kudos to the publishers (and authors) for that... Enough to make a 5, if not for the farcical cover. Therefore, this gets a 4."
3,"Decent, especially if you like scores","It's a good CD, especially if you're really into musical scores. Me, I like lyrics with my music, so I wind up pressing skip a lot...and this bollocks Disney's pulling with getting really, really, REALLY crappy C-list singers to cover iconic tracks is more than a little annoying, but with the originals ahead of them on the CD, I can deal with it by not listening."
4,On land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word.,"The Little Mermaidwas the film that revitalized the animation division of Disney. The great songs in the movie by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken were at least partially responsible for the film's success. Wonderful songs like ""Part of Your World"", ""Under the Sea"" and ""Kiss the Girl"". But, unfortunately, there aren't enough songs to fill up an entire album, so the second half of the CD consists of the instrumental score. It's a good score, certainly, but it's not as enjoyable to listen to as the songs. But fans of the film should get this CD, anyway."

5,Excellent product,The CD certainly captures the essence of the film. My daughters enjoy listening to the CD while they are playing and they don't have to be watching tv all the time!
4,The power of this book,"Ask yourself: how may other 30 year old Science Fiction novels could generate MORE THAN 100 reviews here? (Heck, look at the huge number of 30 year old SF novels that are long gone, forgotten, and out of print).Heinlein was at his best when pushing, prodding, and shocking the complacent ol' grey matter of the reader into thinking. Here it is quite obvious that he has done it again.Love the book or hate it, but read it and think about it. Somewhere, RAH is smiling."
5,Classic!,The movie was unworthy of the title - forget the movie!!! This book is a timeless classic. Did not disappoint. A magnificent work!
5,The best of military Science-Fiction,"This is without a doubt one of the greatest military stories to have ever been put onto paper.The story follows the journey of a young soldier named Juanito Rico. During his time he learns the importance of being in the military as he gains higher ranks. Whilie he is in his training though a group of alien creatures known as the Bugs attack Earth which causes him in get himself involved in the war.Not only are the morals exceptional, but the action in it is great, and the the technology is fantastic. The battle suits that they use are very cool, and the bugs that they fight are without a doubt one of the most terrifying enemies I have read about in Science Fiction.The movie lacks all the qualities of this fantastic novel, this is one novel that nobody should miss."
5,Starship Troopers,"Forget the movie that was a very poor effort, this story is absolutely the best book (written by man) of all time. Heinlein at his best, the prophet as always. After reading it, written over 50 years ago, and look at society today, he has identified our problems and offered solutions. After reading this story, don't miss the rest of Heinlein's efforts. All exceptionally well crafted."
2,What is all the fuss about ?,"I finally got around to Starship Troopers, after reading over and over again that it's a classic. I found most of the book to be dated, turgid, and boring. I'm sure it was ground-breaking when it was published in 1959; in the interim, however, other authors (most notably John Scalzi) have taken the same theme and greatly improved upon it. For a supposed military sci-fi adventure, there are few actual battle scenes. Try Old Man's War or The Ghost Brigades- they both leave Starship Troopers in the intergalactic dust."
5,Required reading,This is an excellent book. I wish it was required reading in public schools today. Not just a great sci-fi fiction but an excellent poitical piece as well
5,ONE OF THE BEST EVER,"First, all the movie had was good special effects, a nice little shower scene, and a few lines from the book thrown in. The movie did this book no justice.(Don't get me wrong I liked the movie but it fell flat compared to the book.) What I found most intersting about the book was the philisophical, moral, and social ideas described in the book. The last time I felt so compelled to think about such issues was my in my sociology class.But anyway the detail it's written in is great, it has great action, and the storyline is good. Definitely one of the best."
3,"Good, But I Prefered STRANGER","What we have here is basically an entertaining boy's adventure story with a healthy side-helping of Heinlein's typically iconoclastic socio-political spew. His ideas are always well thought-out & intellegent (with the exception of his absurdly Skinnerian solution for juvenile delinquency), though he seems to have trouble integrating them into the narritive. Still, Heinlein keeps the story moving along briskly, & anyone who enjoys a good SF yarn should give this a shot. Better yet, pick up his STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND - a much more mature & artful book."
3,"Despite reviews, not what I expected","Before reading this book, I checked the other reviews on this page to get a feel for it. Many say that it has more to do with social theory that battling alien attackers. I figured, how bad could it be? They were right. I got my fill of that stuff in college. If I want to read ideas about social structures, I'll read Kafka or Benjamin. When I pick up a book called Starship Troopers, I want to read about starships and troopering. To this book's credit though, it did hold my interest throughout as the tirades were fairly brief and it did present the ideas and then move along. So, if you want to read about pitched space battles, stay away, don't let the first chapter fool you. It is not all like that. But if social and military theory are more your style, you'll probably enjoy this."
5,GREAT BOOK,"I love this book. It is truly imaginative in the way in which he builds the society. Also if you read between the lines of what he says in this book it really is an extrapolation of what he saw in society and military technologies. All in all a very good read. The best part of it is that Heinlein describes the revolution in military technology that we see today, but he wrote of it in 1957!!!I really enjoyed this book. I will say that I was supremely disappointed in the movie. Although, the movie could be in no way worse than Dune's adaptation."
1,I was bored out of my mind!,"The first and last thirty pages were as eventful as the movie, but nothing happened in the middle."
3,Starship troopers,"I bought this book because I needed it for a class, I am not into science fiction, if I was this is as good as any.What was more intresting was the writers life which I read about in another book"
5,Starship Troopers - One of Heinlein's best,"As a recently retired veteran of almost 23 years of total service, I think that RAH captured in this book an essential truth about soldiers; that is, in spite of the advanced weapons systems and powered armor available to his Mobile Infantry the troopers themselves possess the same mind-set and philosophy of their predecessors. This is evidenced by Heinlein's use of quotations at the start of each chapter of Starship Troopers (i.e., ""You apes want to live forever? - Unknown Marine Sergeant, France, WWI). Although his political views expressed in this book may be considered a little extreme with regard to the fact that only honorably discharged veterans were granted citizenship, the book overall is a good, fast read."
5,Not so arguably the best Sci-Fi novel ever written,"1) READ THIS BOOK 2) Skip the movie. It does not feature the use of Power Armor, a key component in the warfighting capability of the Mobile Infantry in the book. Without it, there is no ""Mobile"". 3) Possible the most misunderstood (or simply misread) sci-fi novel ever written. Read it and THINK. I find it amusing that it has offended idiots on all sides of the political spectrum (""Heinlein's a Fascist! No, he's a Communist! No, a Libertarian! No, a Liberal, a Right wing-nut..."") What counts is that he was one of the finest authors the U.S. ever produced. 4) I envy those of you about to read this book for the first time. It forever changed my way of looking at the world, as it has done for many others. Enjoy!"
5,One of the Sci-Fi books ever,This is with out a doubt one of Heinlein's best works. Then Hollywood goes and make a movie that has almost nothing to do with the book.
3,Worth reading,"Its a good story and worth reading. I would not rate it as one of my all time favorite SF books, but it was entertaining."
1,C'mon!,"I read this book in 1977 and 20 years later I am stillwondering where all the ""action"" is in this book everyone is talkingabout. I think its just a big pile of SH-T. Its all politics and philosophy. Do yourself a favor, and just see the movie."
5,Not meant to be a movie,"Geeze...First of all if you paid good money to watch that abominable movie and liked it, you will most likely get nothing at all from this novel. Starship Troopers is not an action/adventure movie. It is not a story about a Fascist society nor is it a political manifesto. Starship Troopers is an examination of military ethics (easy pacifists), motivation, and leadership. Most people with some military experience and a solid high school education will get this immediately. Many without a military background who possess a solid high school education and an open mind will also get it. If you come up short on either of those, keep re-reading until you do get it. I was once assigned with someone in the USAF who read it, didn't get it, and referred to it as ""rightist drivel"" but then he wasn't much of an Airman anyway..."
5,From private to lieutenant...,"There are a lot of aspects of this book that people address such as Heinlein's views on government, the military, and so on. But what struck me about this book is the description of Rico's transition from an ignorant civilian to a soldier to an officer. Though I can't compare my military career to his in some of the big ways (like combat), the dynamics that Heinlein describes between Rico and the people that he meets are right on. Having just been appointed a second lieutenant a few months ago, I can say that there were more than a few times where I thought ""wow, that's familiar"" to myself. And this is a book that was written 40 years ago--but just as applicable today. Five stars."
3,"A good, not great, sf novel","Its not even close to being Heinleins best novel and is most assuredly not the best military sf. For that, check out The Forever War sometime. Now that is a masterpiece of military sf. This one is only good. Thats all. Nothing more. Something tells me that most of the over the top reviews on here are first time readers and below the age of twelve."
3,selfless government?,"The problem I have with the world in this book is that the people in power are totally trustworthy and benevolent. The teachers in the book downplay the need for rights, but they don't realize that in their fairytale world no one NEEDS rights. If the police would never unfairly harrass members of a particular ethnic group, plant evidence, or take bribes then of course no one would need rights. If Heinlein had been able to problematize his world by putting moraly flawed humans in power, it would have been a more interesting book. The author just didn't seem mature enough to question the world he created. For this reason the book seemed to predictable and real (interesting)problems seemed glossed over (i.e. if anyone in power was ever selfish or dishonest what would happen?). A little childish philosophically if you ask me."
3,Starship Troopers Alright Read,"Robert A. Heilein brings us a book that is easy to read and only takes a few hours to read. It also presents to us a world that is much like the Roman Republic of old in which you have to do military service in order to serve as a senator. What we have to look at now, though is that fact that Heinlein presnts an average story, not exactly great and not bad either. I got tired of being beaten over the head with his philsophy that all children must be beaten to become productive citizens. I wanted him to play a little more with the politics of the era and leave the moral issues alone. It was ok at the beginning, but soon became redundant. His explaination of the organization of the Mobile Infantry was great and his three battle scences were well illustrated and gave the reader a nice view of future combat. Just wish he'd done more with this stuff instead of battering us with beating children."
4,Wanted more action,"I read this many years ago and decided to re-read on my kindle. If you watched the movie, you will be surprised at how much was changed. They did that for a reason, which is that the book is 80% talk and 20% action, which would have made a boring movie. Instead, they made a stupid movie, not at all true to Heinlein's ook.That said, the book is a fun read, but it could have been so much better. Most of what we are told in the talk scenes could have come through in action scenes as well. The war ends up being a subplot to the ethical and political message, not the medium through which we are taught.Heinlein is a great writer, no doubt, but read The Forever War if you want an SF war story, or read early Clarke like Rendevous with Rama, or 2001 to see how the message and the story can be merged. Even Ender's Game makes us think more without preaching at us.Still, a book worth the read."
5,Great Book,I have the animated TV show of the Roughnecks that I loved so much and now reading what it was all based off of it extremely cool.
3,Hard sci-fi?,"This is NOT good science fiction. I know it is hailed as one of the great works of the genre but I fully disagree. It IS an interesting social commentary but it is not good sci-fi. In fact, the ""science fiction"" is a thinly stretched veneer that barely covers (and it even breaks in spots) a somewhat labored commentary on the geopolitical environment in which the author lived when he wrote Starship Troopers.Some parts were really thought provoking like the concept of authority and responsibility in the sovereign power to rule. Also interesting is Heinlein's juxtaposition of communists with the bugs. I respected the fact that he slammed both the Americans and the Communists. So is it worth reading? Yes! Is it great sci-fi? Not really. The sci-fi is too obviously a vehicle to make a statement and comes off as transparent."
5,"Excellent Action, mixed with a harsh (but just) society.","Excellent book. Has action and is thought provoking. It is true, we take freedom for granted n the west, and most of us do not cherish or appreciate the right to vote etc. Look at the way the americans treated the vietnam vets. That would have never happened in the society this book describes. Maybe we ought to flog people instead of jailing them. It might work (unlike jail) and it would be cheaper. Anyhow ; BEST SF BOOK I HAVE READ FOR AGES."
4,Philosophy vs. Action,"I read this book as a teen and recently re-read it in preparation for viewing the upcoming movie. I had forgotten the eternal philosophic discussions which I sort of skimmed because they are so long. I loved the action parts and the power suits. The insects are a weird, but exciting part. I think overall it is a good book, but not for kids. This is one for 18 years or older. I liked the way women are portrayed. Heinlein was far-thinking in regards to women's roles in the military. I hope the movie does the book justice."
4,Recommended Reading.,"Almost ten years ago, and long before Starship Troopers became a movie, the Commanding General of the 10th Mountain Division, (Light Infantry) reommended that Company Grade Officers and young Staff NCO's read this book. There is much more than meets the eye. While the movie was amusing and visually pleasing, the book is more significant."
3,where is my watch,I purchased a tag watch 2 months ago and still do not have a running watch in my possession. The watch was not running when I received it--I was instructed to replace the battery---the watch still did not run---I have returned it and still have no watch. I think they should send a new watch rather that repairing an expensive watch which is not running.
1,Which way is South?,"This book has beautiful pictures and some nice ideas and designs -- if you can figure out what the writer is talking about. Extremely confusing instructions and diagrams. I bought this book to learn the right angle weave, but it is useless for that purpose. Too bad, it had some real potential."
1,5.1 pieces of junk,"These speakers never worked properly with my Audigy 2 ZS Platinum sound card. The sound quality was not that great either. Various speakers worked at various times but never all together. Before I boxed it up and shipped it back, the right front speaker hadn't worked in a week and a half.I ended up buying the Klipsch 2.1 pro media speakers that I had owned previously. They finally broke and I had used the Logitech Speakers to replace my old Klipsch 2.1s after reading all the positive reviews on Amazon. The Klipsch speakers blow the Logitech speakers away. 'Nuff said."
4,Logitech Z-5300e THX-Certified 280-Watt 5.1 Surround Sound PC and Gaming Speaker System,"Works great for the price. Bass is a tiny bit overpowering, and I had to dial it down to almost nothing when listening to music.Overall a good entry-level surround set for what you pay. If you need more inputs, go with the 5500."
5,oh happy days,oh my god the second season is off the chain.boy you all are doing it up.is like after you looked at the first season you just have to get the second.regardless.even if you have to put off a bill payment.i cant wait for the third season.the long wait is killing me.i beg you please bring out the third season asap.i can only put off so many bills lol.
5,Beast Wars Season 2,Great TV show. Used to always watch it when I was younger and was living back in Canada.
5,What white supremacists need to hear,This is what white supremacists need to hear! Skillfully composed and the two best tracks are Panther Power and The Devil Made Me Do It.
5,MMC is the best!,I love the CD. I listen to it non-stop. I love I Saw Her First and Merry-Go-Round. JC Chasez is the best thing about that CD!
2,unhappy,The description of this tool should be changed and made clearer. I was expecting a totally different tool than I received.
4,Nice Buy,"I found this cream to be a light scented,light moisturizing great buy. It has helped some with my dark circles and overall I would recommend this product for skin conditions. It does not work overnight but I've noticed a difference with my eyes and elbows."
5,"""Frugal Indulgents"" is what I should have learned in college","This book should be required reading for recent college graduates, and anyone with champagne tastes on a water budget. The voice is fabulous, funny, wry, witty, and thoroughly engaging. Some of the examples were enough to make me laugh out loud, but what's best about this read is that it's practical, too. There's real advice here on how to live the high life on a low income. I bought this book for all my friends who are graduating college, or struggling though the early years in the big city. It really made me feel better about being broke, and helped in transitioning to a grown-up life with style. Read this book, follow the author's sharp, smart advice, and live swankily ever after."
1,Good Idea. Not so great advice.,"Being a 20-something girl trying to learn how to live a decadent life on a budget, I thought this would be the perfect book. Instead it teaches bad morals and not so great advice. If you're prepared to lie, cheat, steal, and run up a credit card bill, then this book is for you. It's filled with way too many quizes and testimonials, that you find yourself thumbing through the book to find some substance. If you want something cutesy and fun, give it a try, but don't rely on it to help you learn to how to eat your cake and pay for it too."
2,"A ""Best Yet"" collection","This is really a collection of their popular singles from all previous albums please one new song ""Wild Boys"". While I'm glad I did buy it, in hindsight it really wasn't worth it. I think Duran Duran is best experienced either on highly processed CDs or Records or as you watch their music videos -- in terms of live playing, they aren't as good as many bands."
4,"Duran Duran, Arena CD, original 1984 release","This a very good live cd, that said, the songs don't stray much from the studio versions & since re-adding this to my collection (I once owned this cassette) I've been wanting to get more Duran Duran CDs. I guess that's the purpose for these live and/or greatest hits releases in the first place, at least from the record companies point of view. This release would serve the needs of casual, new & hardcore Duran Duran fans alike."
4,Yummy to the core,"This album is awesome! I remember going to a friends house just to hear it and watch the video. By the way, don't let anyone under 13 watch the video, it is a little racy, but it is still awesome."
1,a live album should not sound like this,"this is not a real live album.it is very apparent that this so called ""live"" album is concoted in the studio by technicians.songs like hungry like the wolf and girls on film reek and should be avoided.DONT BUY OR EVEN LISTEN TO THIS NEW WAVE TRASH.for a good live album get FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE from PETER FRAMPTON instead.one star."
1,The Duran's Worst.,"First of all I want to say that I got all the duran albums and singles. This one is really the worst.It doesn't sound live at all infact, as the durans themselves said, they recorded a lot in the studio.There are a lot of much better live bootlegs."
1,Velvet Heat: Erotic Poetry For the Carnal Mind,"The title leads one to believe that this might possiably be a wonderful page turner, filled with ""erotic Poetry"", but as I read through these poems, I was very disappionted. I own many erotic poetry books, and found this one ""not"" erotic at all. These poems didn't grasp my intrest, nor provoke thought. This to me, is indeed the one of the worst displays of erotic poetry I have ever read. The poetry having no meter, nor rhythm."
1,Ordered Mauro but got Bullinger,"I purchased this book through the Kindle store expecting a copy of Mauro's ""The Hope of Israel"" which I've been looking forward to reading for quite some time but I received a book by E.W. Bullinger instead. Seemingly I need to begin having the previews sent to my Kindle prior to purchasing any books."
4,Great Movie,I remember seeing Ivanhoe in the theaters many years ago and really enjoyed it. When I saw it on DVD I ordered it and was surprised that this was a different version than that I had watched previously --- albeit an excellent and entertaining movie.
3,Ivanhoe (1982) DVD Review,"This made-for-TV movie is rather one-dimensional and geared for young audience. James Mason is one of my all-time favorite actors, but I didn't care for his haircut in this film. I'd rather watch the 1952 version, which has nice photography and a superb score by Miklos Rozsa."
2,not as discribed,"The item that I recieved was not a flat bed tow truck w/race car, It was a semi tractor trailer w/ 1 ATV on it and there was a place for another but was missing. Not what I thought that I bought but with no image it's his word against mine."
5,ATTENTION READ THIS BEFORE CONSIDERING BUYING HAGGARD,IF U SKATE...HAVE WATCHED VIVA LA BAM OR JACKASS....WILDBOYZ....OR ANY OF THE Cky VIDEOS........BUY HAGGARD......IT'S HILARIOUS....I GARUNTEE U'VE NEVER SEEN ANY THING LIKE IT. I BOUGHT IT LAST DECEMBER AND SO FAR EVERY PERSON THAT I'VE LET BORROW IT HASN'T SAID ONE NEGITIVE THING ABOUT IT. U THINK UR COOL CAUSE U KNOW EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED ON JACKASS OR VIVA LA BAM..BELIVE ME.......U HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING.........YET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Disappointed,"I bought this movie with the expectation that it would be funny. I didn't find it funny at all. It was bizarre and fully of ""potty"" humor. I love the Jackass crew, and consider myself to be a fan of Bam Margera's. This movie just didn't deliver for me."
2,Not Haggard Enough,"I thought this movie was gonna be great because I have been a huge fan of the CKY movies. Unfortunately, I thought this movie sucked. It would have been better if it didn't have all those stupid montages every other scence. Bam's got a lot of potential for directing but he needs a different approach."
1,Crappy crap crap (crap),"This Clerks-esk low budget film is, shall I say, crap. I love Bam and his CKY disks and Viva La Bam make me laugh so hard I have to pee. This movie was poorly acted (no surprise) but the crew are actually trying to act so it just seems dumb. DiCamillo was annoying as usual. The ""plot"" was boring and average. There are a few truly funny moments but not enough to warrent buying this DVD. Do yourself a favor and buy a CKY DVD."
5,wow,"This is literally one of the funniest movies ive ever seen. Its so perfect and so hilarious. Bam Margera is an awesome director/actor/co-producer. The CKY crew(which consists of Ryan Dunn, Rabb Himself, Brandon Dicamillo, and Rake Yohn)do an awesome job of acting like idiots and making this movie enjoyable. This movie had me laughing through-out the entire film(which few movies can do). The dialogue is perfect and the story is even more hilarious. The score isnt too bad either. You hear alittle bit of HIM, some cky and some Gwar(why wouldnt Bam skip a chance to promote the bands he loves?). And with celebrity appearances(Tony Hawk, and Bucky Lasek to name a few)what more can you ask for?If you liked MTV's jackass, you'll like this movie even more."
1,Really?,"I was satisfied with the delivery, but not so much with the condition of the tag! When I got it, it was in a manila envelope with no protection, & two of the tag's corners were bent!! I'm not too happy about that, so just be aware!"
4,BIGFOOT LIVES !,WHAT A FUN FAMILY MOVIE. WE SAW THIS MANY YEARS AGO AND JUST BOUGHT OUR OWN COPY. WE LAUGHED AND CRIED THROUGHOUT. WHETHER YOU BELIEVE OR NOT SEEING THIS MOVIE WILL BRING A TWINKLE TO YOUR EYES AND HEART.
5,One of My Favorite Movies,"I'm only 23, about to be 24, but some movies you love forever, no matter how long ago it was you first saw them or how old you are when you rediscover them again for the trillionth time. For me, one such movie is Harry and the Hendersons. If you've seen it before and have been waiting for the DVD release, and let's face it, who hasn't seen this move that wanted a DVD release, then now's your chance, and I say jump. Fond memories of classic movies like this, they're only made once in your life, but with things like DVDs and what have you, fond memories can live a long time."
5,Harry and the Hendersons,Always a Great Moviemake you think of something othere then the Fool you put in as president (obommer)
4,Great Family Film,"Sasquatch in Da House!!What I can't understand is WHY they left this little gem out to languish for all these years. But i heard that it's being released at the same time as ""Twilight Zone - The Movie"". Could it be they're targeting the Lithgow groupies?"
3,good and safe but ....,"I like this sewer cover because is safe, won't loose, and it is easy to pull it out, however it does not fit properly and because of the littly bracket that holds the cord it is kind of tricky to pull the sewer hose.overall good."
2,"Good Idea, But Didn't Last","I thought this was the perfect cap for my 4"" bumper on a Fleetwood pop-up camper, but it has a few flaws. Good quality materials and easy to install on the camper, only took a few minutes. Once I put it on, I couldn't get my sewer hose out of the bumper and hand to take off the metal clip that pounds onto the end. The metal clip the line connects to was just thick enough that the hose wouldn't slide out. Next trip out I get to my destination and the metal clip is still on one end of the bumper, but the cap had fallen out and the line broke, allowing it to be deposited along the highway somewhere. Still have one on the other end. I am just going to buy two bolts and stick them through the holes in the end of the bumper and be done with it."
2,Not the original recording - beware,"This is a nice collection for Demis Roussos if you didn't listen to the original recording before and don't have memories with each song and how it exactly sounded with his dreamy voice over 30 years ago. His voice in this mostly re-recorded collection is a bit rusty and the music is poorly conducted compared to the original recording. I gave it two stars as it contains also some of his newer (80s) nice songs in it's original format such as ""Summer Wine""."
2,A sad sad tale,"This book was the book that could've been something special,but falls short in every way possible. Obviously, the onlyreason it was published was because ofHideous's very short stay with the revival of the powerrock/punk band, The Misfits; the band name sells people, andthe book got published, it's as simple as that.Except for the journals Hideous kept while in the Misfits,when all was said and done, I didn't believe any of themudslinging (whether is was true or not) and Myke Hideousaccomplished nothing other then portraying himself as aangry, bitter, self-loathing, hateful person with nothing better to dowith his time but make a few bucks off another band's name, aband he barely knew."
1,Idiotic,"I'm sure this book would be very scandalous if it weren't so stylistically painful to read. The author suffers from a very common problem that plagues many authors, he overcompensates the main character's confidence to the point of self-righteous arrogance. It's hard to take a pretentious protagonist seriously. The whole book reads like it was written as a creative writing assignment at a community college (which probably got a B-). I was no where near as offended by the subject matter as I was by the style. I threw it away so it wouldn't contaminate my other books with it's crappy writing. Hack work."
5,Krazy Glue,I use this to glue my sons Legos. For years they were all over the floor in pieces. Now we Krazy Glue it. It works perfectly!
4,Good,"A great book that openly discusses the problem that many men have or think they have, penis size. Solutions are offered and the book explains that many men don't have small penises but are only under the impression that their penis is small. A solution is given to these men, and that is the surgical penile enhancement. However, if the knife isn't your way of dealing with small or average sized penis then read ""The Advanced Man! The quick and easy way to turn your small, or average sized penis into a large super human love tool without wasting your money on B.S. ... Book on CD-Rom for PC & Mac Computers"" by Platinum Millennium, a great book that will teach you the good methods of increasing your penis size "" By Platinum Millennium, the definite resource for penile enhancement without too much trouble."
2,"Scriipture Taken Out of Context, Genie God Syndrome","Repeatedly the author takes scripture out to context and applies it somewhere completely inappropriate. She cites God's work in her life as a answer to her prayers, leading to the conclusion that if God is not answering your prayers, you must not be living up to His standard, actually asking, ""Are you a candidate for God's blessing?"" (Study guide, week 3 question 5). About 1/2 of my bible study is unchurched and the book is reaffirming all the reasons they have chose not to participate in organized religion. To be fair, my complaints are more about the accompanying study guide than the book itself, which is fairly superficial."
5,Purchased 6 more for gifts,Thoughtfully written and insightful. I purchased four more copies for my four married sons and two more as gifts for others. I rarely do that kind of thing. But this book by Stormie Omartain is worth the read. -Rev. Dr. Donald Wilber
5,Geat comedic duo,"As a small child I loved watching these guys, and I began purchasing these dvd's whenever I could track one down. I highly recommend this movie and anything else they have made."
2,Do NOT buy blu-ray set for regular DVD!,"Okay, first I don't have blu-ray. I refuse to go to yet ANOTHER video format. But I wanted a DVD of the new transfer of A&C MEET FRANKY with the correct logos (the last DVD had Realart Titles). So I bought this set as I knew the blu-ray was correct. So what did Universal do for the DVD disc? They stuck in the old Comedy Legends disc from 2000. A transfer from the dupe 35mm fine grain with plenty of white dirt and a bad audio ""fix"" in the main title (a trumpet riff repeats annoyingly). My question is, why BOTHER to put two discs in this set if one of them isn't going to be of the new transfer? Phooey. Don't get me wrong - I'm sure the blu-ray disc is great and if that's what you're after I can recommend it blindly. But if you want the latest transfer on DVD, it ain't here."
5,KIDS LOVED IT!,Perfect family friendly spooky movie! Brought back memories for me personally and was so happy to see my 11 and 9 year old appreciated it too.
1,Bud and Lou have done better.,"The really sickening thing about this ""classic"" is that people probably wouldn't like it if all of the scary scenes were taken out. Bud and Lou's only unfunny feature is filled with gloomy settings and great set pieces, but its plot is weak and drained for satire. Almost a waste."
2,DVD Lacks Quality Transfer....Disappointed,"I love this movie...unfortunately, Universal did not take the time to have a pristine print made and transfer something beautiful to DVD. Instead, they must have transferred from some old print they had in their vault, and it shows. It's no better than the VHS tape. I was shocked at how bad, how splotchy the print was. I really expected much more, like a nice beautiful print, and I was eager to see Abbott and Costello like I had never seen them before.....but no."
5,Very Nostalgic and Great Collector's Items,"I first received this book for Christmas 1998 at the age of 5, and I grew up on many of these movies. However, I didn't take care of the book; I drug it around everywhere and got the cover and some pages torn off, so for some years I regretted not taking care of this book.Thank God for Amazon! I finally found this book after years of searching and bought a used copy for about $4 including shipping, and for that it was DEFINITELY worth it. I never really that this book had little behind-the-scenes pages of the films as well as the incredibly detailed stories. I also loved that the pictures are actual stills and sketches from the movies, rather than cheap, kiddy computerized images. For anyone whose a big fan of Disney movies, or anyone who wants to introduce their kids to Disney and read them bedtime stories, this is a GREAT book.5/5 for the book itself4/5 for the condition the book is in"
5,"VERY GOOD, BUT DESERVES AN UPDATE","I guess like many, my first approach to Zhang Yimou was through his epic masterpiece ""Hero"". Then, I started to watch his prior works. And then I started to read about him. I'd say this book is as good as the other books in the ""Conversations With Filmmakers"" series of the University Press of Mississippi. Also, it's the best book I've read so far, either in English or in Spanish, not only about the most important contemporary Chinese director, but actually, about his entire generation. The only problem: it's already missing six films, from ""Happy Times"" to his collaboration in ""Chacun son cinéma"". As good as it is, I'd say it's already waiting for an update."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I was a little disappointd about this book and was glad that I oniy paid half price on it. Because the half price was all it was really worth. Some of the contents in the book was poorly written. The only positive thing that I saw in the book was a wonderful relationship between Cindy Crawford and her son, Prestley. And that was it!!"
2,Many errors in just the first section,"I passed the CNA 5 exam but it was only because I used the Novell's Guide to Netware 5 book and the Novell CD documentation to check the errors in this book. In addition to incorrect information there were plenty of really annoying typos, especially in the self tests. The Exam Watch tips are good, I wish there were more of them."
2,Another study guide written from a Beta version !!!!!,"I could not believe it, there are references to MCSE in several different places in this book. (A sloppy cut and paste job from an MCSE guide) Server requirements are from Network 5 beta. Also, test objectives are not clearly defined in this book and the section on printing does not go deep enough into NDPS."
5,Gold book!!,"HENNEKENS is a very didatic book in Epidemiology Methodology, easy and simple to read and understand and very complete. All advanced courses in Epidemiology must recomend it."
5,Couldnt put it down.,My opionion will be a bit one sided (being a long time red hot chilli peppers fan) this book is a must read. One of those books you just cant put down. Its hard to believe that guy is still alive.
3,Just Okay...,I love Anthony Kedis....but his writing style was very remedial. I was hoping for more psychological insight from him. This came highly recommended by a friend who is a recovering addict. I'm not...maybe that's why I didn't get as much out of it.
5,"Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic","I am a huge RHCP fan and when this book came out I bought it right away... and I couldn't put it down.This book really gives you a look into every aspect of sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll as a whole. Anthony Kiedis goes through every detail that accompainied him as the Chili Peppers rose to fame. He talks about losing some of his closest friends to drugs and how he had to continuously deal with the bad choices he made early in life, and the fond memories of making some of the greatest rock ever.If you are a Chili Peppers fanatic like me... this book is wonderful."
4,The Page Turner by the Californicator,"If you are a big fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers you should find this insight into the life story of Anthony Kiedis quite interesting.The book is written in what seems to be an honest and revealing manner, allowing the reader to see deep into the life of the front man of one of the greatest rock bands ever.From a childhood laced with drugs and profanity to the development of the stellar studio sessions, this book is a must read for anyone wanting to know more about the Chili Peppers."
5,crazy-junkie-perfectly entretained,"AK is kind of crazy, well his life has been crazy.. while you're reading this you just can't believe all of the ""adventures"" he have lived. Drugs-sex-funk-punk-his family-his friends- red hot chili peppers- and more drugs!.. I fully recomend this book.. If you are RHCP fan you'll love it!"
5,A Masterpiece,"Scar Tissue is a wonderfully written semi-autobiography by Anthony Kiedes about Anthony Kiedes. It is a riveting and tell-tale story of the slow but eventually meteoric rise of the Red Hot Chili Peppers but more importantly a tale of life long friendships, broken relationships, battling addictions, and memories of a lifetime. Anthony Kiedes tells a very compelling, well composed story about all things Scar Tissue. Definitely a book everyone should read~"
3,I love Anthony Kiedis,"Since i'm already in love with the frontman from RHCP, the book was really good."
3,Not as interesting as I hoped it would be....,"I am a huge fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and have been forever. I am also a bit of a biography junkie--I especially love reading about artists from the ""punk rock era."" Even though this was well written (by a ghost writter), it lacked something. All the talk of sex and drugs masked some intimacy that Anthony seemed unwilling to give to us. That's fine, but he came off pretty shallow because of it. I find it hard to believe that he is that shallow, but sadly with the exception of the last chapter he really didn't show much depth as a human being. He really didn't show his true demons--pain, fear of abandoment, and disappointment over having to obviously grow up way to fast. Perhaps with his found again sobriety he will do more soul seaching and write another book that will reflect his soul better than this book was able to do."
4,Great read!,"Loved it, this book made me an even bigger RHCP fan. A must read! I couldn't put it down, I never knew anything about Anthony and now I feel like I know him. I cried when Hillel died. John and Anthony's relationship is amazing how it blossoms."
4,Loved it...,"I'm not a huge fan of the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, but I'm familiar with some of their more popular songs. I picked up this book mainly because one of my friends was reading it and I scanned the first couple of pages and thought it sounded interesting.I was engrossed throughout the entire book. Kiedis has certainly led an interesting life and my interest was peaked throughout. I enjoyed the writing style and the structure.Thumbs up from me."
3,Like New?,"The description on the condition of the book I purchased was 'like new'.However, it arrived without the cover jacket. In other words, it did indeed have a hard bound cover. However, it was completely blank and looked like cardboard. The carefully designed outside 'cover jacket' was missing. I'm in the business of design, so this was extremely disappointing. However: this co-authored book about the life of Anthony Kiedis was a much better read than the (also co-authored) story of Keith Richards life I also purchased (new) over the HOliday. Thanks."
4,ROCKAPOTUMUS...,Great read. Played up a bit though of course. Could use more pictures of his ex-girlfriends topless.
5,"Great Band, Great Bio",I don't know why this book has gotten such a bad wrap.Every chapter is pretty entertaining and I now feel likeI have a better understanding of where a lot of their songscame from.Anthony Kiedis is an extraordinary human being with some serious flaws.All heart.This book is a must read for any RHCP fan.
4,Good read,This books gives you an idea of the ups and downs of the rock star lifestyle.It also gives you real insight into the attitude and philosophy of Anthony Keidis and an idea of what he's had to overcome to accomplish what he has.I found I couldn't put it down.
3,Mediocrity,"While the book is interesting and Kiedis has had a unique and exciting life in some ways, it also sort of blows the lid off the myth of the exciting celebrity lifestyle, at least in this case. His life seems full of a lot of desperation and misery. I have to agree with some of the other reviewers on here who have a lower opinion of Kiedis since reading this book. I definitely lost a lot of respect for him after reading this. He always did seem like a somewhat nice guy, but after reading his story, seems more like a vicious, thieving, jerk who lucked into working with some talented musicians and becoming famous. He wasted most of his peak years using drugs and feeling sorry for himself. I'm glad he finally got clean, but he still comes across as an immature, hollow, selfish person who thinks the sun rises and sets with his every move. The last part of the book does become a bit dull, as he fell off the wagon so very many times and it all starts to get redundant."
1,Scar Tissue,Only bought it because my son ordered it. I do not recommend. Not good for Christians. I can't give a review on this product.
4,Artist are worse off than normal people!,The story of this young man is very intriguing.... Funny how muscians who put all their efforts into a single career path have some many trials and tribulations in their lives. It was a great read and shows how difficult it is when you choose this path... drugs in the industry iS rampent and will catch most of these trouble youths who chose this path.. its the inevetable... and how this man survived is surreal. Good for him....Fan of RCP!
2,Worst one of the series,"Having played Suikoden 1-5 I can say that 4 is by far the weakest. I didn't care about any of the characters, and got sick of being in a big stupid boat. Sea battles were kind of fun, sea travel was tedious, and over all this was by far the weakest of the series in almost every aspect. I would rate them best to worst as: 2, 1, 3, 5, 4.2 stars might be being generous but any Suikoden is still better than many rpgs out there."
1,Disappointed!!,"I am a fan of Suikoden series I, II, and III but IV is a completely different game. Sure the name and the idea of 108 Stars of Destiny is there but the main character walks weird, the dialogue is too long, and is rather confusing going from room to room. Suikoden III was excellent but I'm sad to even writing a negative review to one of my favorite series of all times. Rent it first before forking over $40"
5,Quilt Country,"This is a well written and illustrated cookbook. I have the first Cooking from Quilt Country and enjoyed it so much that I knew I had to have the next book. After I bought myself this book, I actually bought this one to give as a gift. The recipes are really easy to make with delicious results. Wonderful cookbook and would highly recommend it."
3,"For me, funny just not the best.","This film, for me is okay. For me, a long time Abbott and Costello fan, I was a little bit disappointed with this one. I grew up watching their films on sunday mornings after church. I've seen all their films, but this one for me, is not one of the best. Looking for a better film that showcases their talents, look for another film. Don't get me wrong, it is funny, just not one of their best."
1,Not Complete,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS CD.This new release of the CD is not the complete soundtrack to the film. It is missing the song, ""Human Again"". I'm befuzzled as to why Disney would release an incomplete soundtrack. Poorly done.A very awful treatment of the greatest Disney musical to date.I highly suggest you purchase the Special Edition Sountrack, which not only includes the above missing track but also includes several bonuses.SHAME ON DISNEY!"
2,Didn't do it for me,"I bought this product because I saw a video about it and I thought ""oh wow, how easy is that!"". When I tried to find the video again, I couldn't find it so I just followed the instructions that came with the product.The bottom line, this product did not work very well with my machine. I have a machine that has a dedicated jeans foot and I used a jeans needle and that seemed to work better on my machine than when I used this gadget. Maybe I used the gadget wrong, but from looking at the instructions, I don't see how it could be any more clearer. I'm just glad that I didn't pay a lot of money for this."
1,Worst movie I have seen,I just wasn't prepared for that much violence and blood. It doesn't even have a pleasant ending. I just want to forget I ever watched it.
1,Poor,"Poor video, video taped in show. Someone walked passed the screen, don't wast your money on this one. Wished I had viewed online."
3,It's not porn,I too think that many of you thought this was going to be some sort of pornographic prison love story and were disappointed. Perhaps you should have taken your $3.99 and spent it on a renting a porno dvd instead parading your dislike of the film.
4,Not perfect but a good solution,I found that yes the cat will always get one or two of them off but so long as you make sure you keep your cat still for the required 5 mins after application then the glue dries enough to keep most of them on. In short if you follow the directions to the letter they work pretty well.
4,Great book,Excellent book! In very good condition. I just feel the diet and lifestyle protocol is too ritualistic and not realistic to modern American culture. The premise and insights into the different body types and connecting with the deeper self is outstanding.
2,vol 4 abbot and costella,movie has lots of skips...to much talking by authors. don;t buy grouped volumes. pick you favorite single movie and buy that instead.
3,Poorly organized boxed set.,"My grandkids love the Abbott and Costello movies, especially the ""scary"" ones. Each time I put the disk into the player, however, I have to guess which movie is on which side. Couldn't the person(s) responsible for creating the boxed set be a little more aware of making the selection easier or at least more apparent? None of my disks are labeled. nor do the boxes state which movie is on which side. You have to wait until the choices come up on the screen, which takes forever, to determine if one must turn over the disk to access your selection. Has anyone else had this problem? I'm fiddling around trying to find the movie when all I want to do is SEE the movie."
4,What can I say? It's a Disney soundtrack!,"Not all Disney soundtracks rate very highly, but many do, and Aladdin is one of them. It does seem that every soundtrack from Disney's second golden era, from The Little Mermaid to The Lion King, all the soundtracks are amazing! The Aladdin soundtrack lets you sing along with Aladdin and Jasmine, and then goes on to present a great instrumental score. Definitely a keeper for any collection."
4,Good soundtrack!,"The number I like most is the wonderful duet ""A Whole New World"" beautifully sung by Lea Salonga and Brad Kane."
2,Lacking,"This story had the makings to be an interesting read, but came up lacking. The narrator finds out he has the ability to see glimpses of the future and what people may be thinking or what they are about to say. He meets Bertha, who is his brothers' intended, and at some point he glimpses his future and she is actually the wife of the narrator. He sees Bertha for who she truly is and that she will despise him. However, this does not stop the narrator from eventually marrying Bertha. On the fourth page before the end, the maid finally makes a dying declaration that Bertha was trying to poison the narrator. However, the only thing that happens then was the couple split and live different lives. I agree with the other reviewer that thought the book was boring."
4,Regarding the Free Kindle Version,"Despite what the description leads you to believe, this ebook contains one story.I knew that when I downloaded it, but I just thought I would mention it for others.The Lifted Veil is a haunting, creepy and thought-provoking short story. I enjoyed it very much. The story is 664 Kindle locations. I wish it had been a little longer. I feel the author could have offered us much more following the death of the lady's maid.While this story is short, it isn't a quick read. You'll want to slow down to capture the emotion in Eliot's writing.This story reminded me of Wuthering Heights. That book is a retelling of a tragic life. The Lifted Veil is a foretelling of another sad existence. If you were to narrate your life story, which would you rather do?"
1,100% Pure Garbage,"It's just sad that this Frankee had the nerve to make this song based on Eamon's ""F*ck It"" track. And to make matters worse, she claims to be his ex when she really ain't.In the song, she say that there are two sides to every story. Well, with this situation, her story ain't worth sh*t. She goes on by blaming him for her f*ck-ups and talk about him not satisfying her sexually. This just makes it obvious that she's a slut and a hoe. I also read a feature on MTV.com about her song and she says that her song is about ""empowering women to fight back when people try to smear your name"". That quote ain't nothin but bullsh*t. Ladies, if U are reading this, do not buy this garbage. Her so-called ""girl power"" answer track is nothing but an embarrassment to the female gender."
2,Mind Capturing Book that Keeps you turning,"Jory Sherman caprutes your imagination from the first page to the last. The story is absolutely great. I couldn't put the book down. It gives the reader a good look into how settlers and trappers had difficulties settling down and getting accustomed to the new surroundings and wildlife. We see how the lives of new settlers are affected by Indians. Jory Sherman presents his main characters as bold people, willing to explore what lays beyond their camps. He is an excellent author, causing a feeling of closeness to the characters in this book. We feel for Sheila and Davey as they attempt to overcome their problems. We can understand their pains and happiness. I would Suggest that anyone who likes old fashioned, historical settings to read this book. You will not be disappointed"
2,"Adorable Print, Diaper Feels Cheap","The print on this diaper is completly adorable! However, the diaper itself feels cheap and isn't very adjustable. It also doesn't feel much like an AIO."
3,Good (not great) comic,"This is another perfectly enjoyable installment in the life of May ""Mayday"" Parker, the stunning Spider-Girl. If you've liked the prior volumes, you'll dig this one, too. Well paced story, fun art. Terrible paper they print these on, though. Maybe the cheaper paper stock keeps the price down. Definitely recommended for the younger set, so enjoy this one with your kids."
5,"Promise, Texas",This book arrived in a timely manner and was in great condition. Loved the book as it was an easy read.
1,Definitely Not A History,"Any book that says on its cover ""The History abnd Culture of Videogames"" and doesn't mention Ralph Baer (the inventor of home videogames) or only devotes one sentence to Nolan Bushnell ( the founder of Atari), isn't worth its price in salt. Stick to Phoenix: The Fall & Rise of Videogames or The Ultimate History of Videogames."
2,Just not worth one's time for the subject it covers.,"There are many better texts on video games out there. Not only that, this book is really misleading by the title. It doesn't ever go into much detail on the history or culture of video games at all. As one who teaches a course on the subject, I really didn't find more than a couple of ideas in the entire book. Also, this isn't so much a book as it is a collection of essays."
4,couldn't put it down,"I love Maeve Binchy. Although Tara Road and Glass Lake are my favorites, Light a Penny Candle stands right up there. The characters become part of you and you can't wait to see what they will do next."
3,weird ending,This was a great read up until the very end. The characters are very sympathetic and believable up until then. Strong characters turn weak and act totally out of character in the final pages. Weird. Can't imagine why Binchy couldn't figure out a better way to wrap things up.
3,A disappointing book,"I found this book quite interesting in the beginning and then about half way through, or after Aisling's wedding, it began to bog down. By the end, which I thought was too quick and far fetched, I had lost interest. It seems that she didn't know how to end it so tacked on a few pages to wind it up."
3,Good but not great.,"I LOVE the writings of Maeve Binchy, but this was the first book of hers that left me feeling empty. I just could not get into the characters after they ""grew up"" and I just did not care much for any of them. The last three chapters felt rushed to find a conclusion and then in the end Maeve Binchy asks the reader to figure out what probably happened, but wanting more."
4,light a penny candle,It was a good story and held my interest throughout.She is an excellent story teller and I enjoy her books.I am now one of her fansd.
5,Casual Cyclist,"I have a Trek WSD 7000 (Ladies Bike). The bar was easy to put on and take off the bike. In addition, the metal loops at both ends of the bar are wrapped in rubber, which is great b/c it will not scratch your bike frame."
5,Works with both woman and kid's bikes,"This is my second one to replace the one that was stolen. It is a little loose but when connected, it does it job well. It also has a good price compared to Yakima or Thule. I would recommend this adapter."
5,Beautiful Music,"Any Bob Marley fan of any level should definitely buy this album. It has some of Bob Marley's most likable yet meaningful music. His voice has never sounded better that it does on ""Them Belly Full"" This is an excellent collection of music for someone who doesn't already have all of his original albums, but everyone should listen to the live version of ""Get Up, Stand Up"" It is the most exciting version of one of his most exciting songs. You can hear the pure emotion in every word sung on this album, which makes you realize how much Bob cared about making a difference."
3,"Good Intentions, Bad Executions","It would appear that i have been duped. I bought this album for the exquisite and tender Mass in Gm, quite possibly the most emotional mass next to Bach's mass in Bm. From the breathy alto entrance of the Kyrie to the final invocation of Amen at the end of the Agnus Dei it is a rollercoaster ride through devotion. Sadly this recording of it is dull, lifeless and faulted in it's pompous belief that an English choir needs little more than to sing it. In truth it is one of the most difficult pieces of music i have ever performed and my expectations were set high. I was also saddened by the lack of adult FEMALE voices, the trebles could not dare to come close to the deep, powerful sound of the altos nor the bright, angelic sopranos. This CD isn't all bad though, the performances of 6 works by Finzi and Bax were extrordinary, i just wish that they could have brought that out in the Mass in Gm. I recommend the Corydon Singers if you are looking for a copy of the Mass."
5,Butterfly tea set,The tea set was a lovely surprise gift for our daughter. The order process was quick and thorough and the cost was very competitive with other vendors. The waiver of shipping charges convinced me I made the best choice. We received the item within 2 days of the shipping date and although fragile nothing was broken. I'll continue shopping with Amazon.
2,I'm baffled by the other reviews,"I found these speakers to be thin and at times shrill on the high end and heavy on the bass, with the middle range almost entirely missing on certain types of music. If you listen to just rock, then they're fine, but if you like a broader range of music, these speakers will disapoint. I learned my lesson about buying speakers online--i'm going to return these and purchase at a store where i can listen and compare before I make a decision."
5,great computer speakers,This one's a no-brainer. I read many reviews before purchasing these and was willing to spend more money also. What it comes down to is the price to sound quality ratio....you can't beat it. The sound is great compared to other similar sets of speakers costing more money. I don't watch movies on this computer but I would venture to guess they would sound fine. I use them more for music while computing. I noticed the price has gone up a tad probably due to the reviews being so good. I think I paid around $37.
5,WOW!!! ...,"This is an amazing little unit which I got for my Toshiba Gigabeat .mp3 player, and at a steal of a price! ... One reviewer complained that it's a bit bassy, which it is, but I was able to remedy this by setting to USER on my .mp3 player's pre-set EQ, and turning it's Bass all the down and adjusting it's treble all the way up at the custom EQ settings - it completely alters to a crisper sound! ... I bought this for outdoor gatherings, it's easy to set up, connect your player, turn it up, and it's a party! ..."
2,"Like most other junk out there, too much bass","Too much bass, even though this kit contains a setting for the sub, it appears the only settings are, ""too much"" all the way to ""way too much"".If you actually like to listen to music, keep moving, these aren't the speakers for you.The two small speakers actually do a not bad job of putting out music, shame about the sub and the subsonics emphasis."
5,Sounds good to me...,"I needed (or rather my computer needed)some new speakears.I was not about to get some more of those ""How cheap can you go?"" speakers,so I took the chance on these.Two words:Oh yeah! I am SO glad I purchased these speakers.A friend of mine said ""Why does your computer sound so clear?"" I answered ""I just bought these Logitech X-230 speakers."" He couldn't wait to go to the store and buy some for himself.So it must be something good about them.Like I said in the title: ""Sounds good to me."""
5,Great speakers for the price,"I gave these speakers as a gift to my husband, he has been thrilled with them. He is an avid gamer and they work great with all of his games. Highly recommend this product to anyone that is looking for 2.1 speakers."
5,Repeat customer.,"I bought this set with a computer purchase at a local store. When it came time to upgrade another computer, there was no question -- head to Amazon and get the same thing. Very good sound at a low price. Audio has come a long way!"
3,OK for the price,"For the price, this speaker system is pretty good. Not as good as others I've owned or heard, but if you wanna save a buck, and your expectations aren't too lofty, this set will do fine."
2,Horrible value,"These speakers are noticeably inferior to my twenty dollar Sennheiser HD202 headphones in sound quality. Music sounds a tad tinny and muddy. Worst of all, the bass is overwhelming and the knob on the subwoofer seems to be useless. These speakers are so mediocre that I've ceased using them in favor of my headphones. I'm a bit puzzled by all the other positive reviews--perhaps they're authored by shills from Logitech? I'd recommend spending a bit more money on a quality speaker system."
3,Bassy,"These speakers are loud. Not enough highs and way to much bass. I mean way, way, too much bass."
3,"Good product, not well executed","Good product, good sound, good price, but HORRIBLE wire-management. The wires from the speakers are incredibly short and then there is a 9 pin serial like cable that connects the sub woofer to the satellite speakers, so one speaker has 3 wires (short I might add) coming from it, which really limits its usage in my office....but the price was good so I'm still satisfied."
4,Great Speakers,"These are Great Speakers for the price. They are worth it. the subwoofer is strong and fills my room with bass. Although when I got my speakers right out of the box it seemed theat the part inside of the subwoofer was lose it would just move around inside, but I havent had any problems with these speakers sice I bought them a month ago."
4,Good deal,"Current price, including shipping, is about $33.I got these when they were more expensive, and I'm quite satisfied with my purchase.They look good and the sound is decent. Sure, it's no high end stereo (I have difficulty even thinking this comparison with a straight face), but for $33, total, they are a good deal.Much superior to theLogitech R-10 Speakers, so I think the extra $15 is well worth it.For some of my music (classical) there's too much bass. It can be reduced but not completely eliminated by the subwoofer control. The subwoofer cannot be turned off or disconnected."
4,Speakers,These are some great speakers for the money. I would recommend them to anyone who is just looking for some inexpensive good sound.And! Amazon was great with the shipping. I got it almost a week before the expected arrival day.
4,Great stereo sound on a budget,This speaker set is great! It was amazingly low priced for what you get. The bass is clean and adjustable in volume and the satellites sound just fine to my ears. It is perfect for my daughter who listens to music and plays games. It also looks very hi-tech and matches her black LCD. The volume knob on the right satellite is very easy to get to on her desk. I would recommend this to anyone looking for good stereo sound.
4,Quality for the price,"I bought these to use at work. While they are nowhere close to myKlipsch PM21 ProMedia 2.1 THX Certified Multi-Media Speaker SystemI have at home, they are also about 1/8 the price. They perform admirably for an inexpensive speaker set. They have decent mid range, but the bass doesn't have a lot of punch. They also use pre-wired speaker wire that you cannot replace, lengthen, etc...Pros:Headphone jack on the front of the control speaker.Solid sound quality for the priceInexpensiveCons:Propriatory speaker wiring.Not much pop to the bassOverall, these are a great buy for the price. You can't go wrong."
2,"Spend a little more, get a lot more.","These are nice speakers, but the main unit stopped producing any sound after about 4 weeks. The other speaker and sub still respond well but 1 channel sound is very annoying.I'd recommend something else."
5,Bang for the Buck,"Great sound for about $40. Now it's not on the level of Bose or Cerwin-Vega, but those cost about 8x asa much. The subwoofer has plenty of power and crisp sound. The two desk top speakers play clean. This system has more than enough power to satisfy and is small."
2,ok but...,my new speakers sound much better than the old ones of course. I like to surf the web with music very early in the morning but with this system there is no way to cut off the sub-woofer-or at least to turn it down. rich SF
2,Odyssey Lost in Space,"When a band goes to be known as just one man, you know that something is about to go bad. The love for mellow tunes and saving the Earth has sold out to synthesized projects and songs that just don't give much to the imagination...Although ""You Give Me Something"" and ""Main Vein"" are pretty catchy, the rest seems to fall flat...I liked them when they were more than just Jay..."
3,Jamiroquai?,"I've only listened to AFO once since I've purchased it and I must say that I'm disappointed. This new piece seems as if it was forced for the sake of belting out another album. The disco-housy feel is overwhelming. Since we all know that disco(house, techno, and etc) today is mostly ditigal, AFO sounds no different. You will not hear that warm, sweet, organic acid-jazz, funk, soul feel on AFO that we're familiar with from past Jamiroquai joints. Instead AFO is cold and lacking in depth. Where's the band? This album sounds like a Jay Kay project, not Jamiroquai. Don't get me wrong! I'm all for Jamiroquai evolving their sound, but this is a little too much. The other Amazon customer reviews are too generous on this one. I only gave AFO 3 stars simply because it's Jamiroquai and I love the other albums (even ""Synchronized""). If you don't have it get Emergency on Planet Earth. You'll be pleased."
3,"Not bad, but this band can do better.","When your 2 most soulful, meaningful and coherent CD's are your first 2, your future may be in doubt. Jay Kay and Co., still recovering from the loss of their original bassist, have not completely found their groove since ""Travelling Without Moving."" It is apparent from this LP. There are some great tracks on this LP, like ""Little L,"" ""Corner of the Earth,"" and ""Main Vein."" The pacing of the LP is really good, and it's very listenable. But there is really no ""bottom,"" or ""soul"" to this record, which was the reason the J's best records, ""Return of the Space Cowboy"" and ""Emergency on Planet Earth,"" were outstanding. There is no song like ""Stillness in Time"" or ""When You Gonna Learn"" on this album. That's a shame.""2001: A Funk Odyssey"" isn't as funky or as meaningful as J's other albums were. I hope Jamiroquai gets it together again, but for the time being, I'll give them passing grades for an otherwise enjoyable record."
3,"Lobo,Rag, and Vixen and pictures","I am highly disappointed that you sell a lousy paperback for a steep price of $16.- Although the cover says :""with pictures"", there are no pictures. This was supposed to be for a young child to introduce him to one of Seton's many fabulous stories. I do not appreciate having been misled by you. This skinny book--unappealing as it is -- is worth no more than $5.-"
5,Family Favorite for 25 years,"For the Children was a favorite of mine when my children were young. They were introduced to some classic musicians and good music for children. Now, my daughter is playing it for her son and he will be able to rock, sing and go to sleep listening to these classic children's songs, sung by popular musicians of his grandmother's era."
3,not very good,"I didn't think this book was as good as his other books. A co-worker told me that it was really good, but it wasn't that good."
2,This book is pathetic!!!,"I've tried this J.P.'s new book again like a sucker, and again, I failed to grap why his books would become so popular. The continued research in his popularity is still a myth to me so far. This book, as his others, is so pretentious, unnatural, contrived, forcefully twisted without proper logic. I have to agree with those who gave this book a minimal ratings. The reason I awarded it with 2 star is for his die-trying pretentious attitude, at least he's always trying to write a book with big-screen mind. What can I say? Once one of an novelist's books was bought by Hollywood, he would fantasize that his next one (or the older ones) would hit again by a Hollywood sucker, so he would start writing screenplays instead of the real thing--a decent novel, all he could create with his imagination is to focus on the overly twisted plots, he would only treat his readers as movie goers and couldn't care less. This book is an insult to a qualified reader."
