5,"My Review ""Lies Beneath""","Norman Bates, oh sorry Norman Spencer (Ford) is married with Claire (Pfeiffer) since plenty of years. But after all those years Claire finds out that her Husband had once, long time ago, an affair with one of his youn students.How does she find out? Well mysterious things are happening to Claire. She is seeing reflections of a young Woman in her bathtub and other spooky stuff happens...It''s maybe one of the best and spookiest Pictures of this decade and one ob my absolute favorites!!!"
4,Excellent,"this book is a complete blessing, the layout and the flow are awesome. I would suggest it for all students of the Word."
1,terrible!,"this book was terrible. simply awful! no authenticity in speech or customs. the protagonists were just cardboard cut outs of contemporary romance novel characters thrown into a different era. i couldn't finish the book(which is a first for me!)because the dialogue between marion and griffth just didnt ring true. i'm very disappointed.......dodd has never been one of my absolute favorite writers, but this book has to be her worst ever!"
2,Disappointing. Tepid.,"This is my first by Ms. Dodd & I was expecting something more gripping/enjoyable. While the overall story was interesting, it wasn't anything to get excited about. Another sappy heroine--the courageous, 'outrageous' & strong character of Lady Marian was completely undermined by the 'helpless, need-to-be-rescued-by-a-man' attitude/situations she found herself in. Some ingenuity, please!"
4,Excellent Learning watch.,"My daughter LOVES the watch. With the minutes listed, she's telling time on her own with confidence.The only drawback is that the wrist strip is very stiff. I also had to sew a little bit of the surface ribbon back down because the stitching didn't catch on to it.My daughter has been wearing it since Christmas (about a month) and so far it's holding up well.It is made in the Phillipines."
5,"beautinful for the girls, they love it.","love this watch for the girls, its seems well built, they have great desings and a nice ligth too. I would buy it again for a gift or other ocation."
1,Why?,"Why was this terrible movie ever released on DVD?Why did the Canadian government fund part of this awful feature?Why isn't there a zero rating available on Amazon.com?This movie is possibly the worst production I've ever seen. The script, audio, video, ..., were just bad beyond belief.On the bright side, the artwork is nice and the disc is shiny!My final verdict: Do not buy nor rent this title. It is a total waste of time and money."
1,Unwatchable,"This is the worst ""thing"" I have ever seen in my life. Using the term ""movie"" or ""film"" is not even an option here. After ten minutes of attempting to adjust the sound, while watching what has the technical merit of a 1950's porn film, I gave up. The Roswell alien autopsy footage has better production values that this stinko. And for some reason this is one of the few gay films that Blockbuster chooses to stock. Go figure, maybe it's some sort of aversion therapy."
4,worked like a charm,"my baby was 7lb,11oz and 20in at birth. he fit into this until he was 6 weeks old and then was too long. that's why i gave it 4 stars. it seemed like we didn't get as much use out of it for the price. i'd almost recommend buying the medium size right away. he did stay swaddled and slept very well those first weeks which was a relief. i used it day and night."
2,Too hard to use,"It works well if you do it perfectly (I was only able to do that once), but at 2am (or any time the baby is squirming) it is too hard to get perfect. I found if it wasn't done perfectly my son was easily able to wiggle out of it. Maybe it's me and I just couldn't do it right, but as a parent (more importantly sleep deprived parent ;-) I needed something easy. I bought the Baby Bonko, which has velcro and is easier to use. It's still not perfect, but a lot better than the miracle blanket and generally he does not get out of it."
4,rock solid,"you know what your gonna get when you purchase a Motorhead cd...no frills, balls out, sweaty dirty rock and roll; and Bomber stands up as a highlight in their expansive catalogue. the songs are tight and the playing is solid and strong. the main album alone is a great buy but this additional cd adds some nice touches for fans....a few live songs and some alternate versions."
4,Bomber is no bomb,"There's no such thing as a bad Motorhead album. The original line up with fast Eddie and Philthy is impossible to beat in the heavy metal realm. Bomber is my least favorite of the Eddie/Phil classic era, but it's still a freakin' fantastic record. I like Ace of Spades, Over Kill, and Iron Fist better, but this is also a must have for Motor heads.Standout tracks: Dead Men Tell No Tales, Stone Dead Forever"
5,"Fantasy, Faerie Tale, Fantastic Fiction","Do you enjoy faerie tales? Stories that contain magical animals, impossible tasks, triumphant heroes and heroines? If so, then East is for you. For adults and teens alike, the story of Nymah Rose is impossible to resist. Fantastic descriptions, a spine tingling adventure fraught with danger, charcacters you come to love, these are some of the elements that make East impossible to put down.A great read aloud for the 8 to 12 set, and a great read alone for 12+, you and your family will enjoy this book immensely. Mine sure did!"
1,Waste of money,This product was horrible. The paste that was pre made was too thick and didn't even stick to my skin. It didn't come with a applicator for the paste you have to make on your own. Waste of time and money.
3,INTERESANTE,WHEN ONE SEES THIS MOVIE THERE IS PERCEIVED THAT THE SAME ONE WAS RECORDED OF VHS AND SPENT TO THE DVD THIS IS SPEAKING TECHNICALLY BUT THE MOVIE IN IF THE HISTORY IS VERY GOOD SOMETHING THAT TENDRIAN THAT HOMOPHOBIC PARENTS SEE VERY MUCH AND I DO NOT KNOW GIVES ACCOUNT THE HURT THAT ESTAN DOING TO HIS CHILDREN AND THIS WAY SAMECUANDO UNO VE ESTA PELICULA SE PERCIBE QUE LA MISMA FUE GRABADA DE VHS Y PASADA AL DVD ESTO ES HABLANDO TECNICAMENTE PERO LA PELICULA EN SI ES MUY BUENA LA HISTORIA ALGO QUE TENDRIAN QUE VER MUCHO PADRES HOMOFOBICOS Y DARSE CUENTA EL DAÃ‘O QUE LE ESTAN HACIENDO A SUS HIJOS Y ASI MISMOS
2,"CD just doesn't find ""The Way""","Granted, The Way is a great song. I heard it a lot several years ago, and enjoyed it enough to buy the CD, naively thinking ""Hey, this song's good, so I guess they all must be!"" Well, about an hour after I plopped the disc into my boom box, I discovered that I was wrong. The Way was great, but it went downhill from there. ""Fire Escape"" was up there with the way, ""Better Than It Was"" was decent, and ""Which Way To the Top"" was trying, but, put simply, this CD's only bright side is ""The Way."" Unfortunately, one song isn't quite worth the 15 dollar price tag."
2,"One great song, the rest are boring...","Although ""the way"" is a great little sing along tune, the remainder of the album contains a sort of monotone medley of several songs that sound like rock ballads. Buy the single, not the album!"
5,Rock band with a pop beat.,"This album is great. The songs are inspiring and the vocals are incredible. My favorites include ""Which way to the top,"" ""Out of my Head,"" and ""Fire Escape."" One of my favorite CD's in my collection, All The Pain Money Can Buy has something for everyone. There are some slower songs, and more upbeat songs, all featuring great lyrics. Even though I've only heard three of the songs on the radio, every song is great. Yet another CD with a great sound."
4,"Tight, well-crafted pop make Mom care about music again.","I bought this CD because it made me care more about pop music than I have in years. I had ""The Way"" in my head for months and then when I heard ""Out of My Head"" I was blown away. I thought Elvis Costello had a hit single again. Tight, cheeky pop tunes are an undervalued art form and you could bounce a quarter off the butt of these.This band actually inspired me to go online and look them up, something I've never even considered doing before (I'm 36 with 2 kids - what do I have time for this?). Now I want to see them live. I thought these guys must be english but they're from Austin and have worked hard to learn their craft. Good for them."
4,One of the best albums of 1998,"Fastball comes from a long line of power pop bands--if you like Badfinger, The Raspberries or XTC you'll appreciate the pleasures of the band's subtle melodies, strong hooks and wry lyrics. While they do stray into preciousness on one or two tracks, the overall effect of this fine sophmore effort is of a band having a great time entertaining themselves (and us) with witty songs."
5,so much more than one hit wonders!,"Yes, ""The Way"" is an awesome song, but all the other songs are good too. The lyrics and music rock. Buy this CD and explore everything on it. Especially check out ""Out of My Head"" and ""Fire Escape""."
3,"Hmmm, ok, I guess","My star system: (so you can get your bearings) A one 1 star is a CD I'd rather not have purchased, a 2 star CD is one I think I really don't think was worth the sale price but don't mind having. 3 to 5 star CDs are ones I enjoy listening to (with 5 being better than 3 and 4) -you get the idea.Hmm, this CD is alright I guess, with some catchy pop tunes (ie The Way) but not much in the way of depth. I mean, hey, its a pop album, give me some catchy songs, but it really fails to deliver. Otherwise its ok; nearly all of the sogs have pretty good replay value. One gripe I do have with it is the way Zuniga and whats his name write 50% of the songs each- while this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it left me feeling like I'd bought two tiny and not so good albums (not what I wanted)."
3,fastball the way,"the first song of the cd, iike ""the way"" the other songs i wasn't too impress with. thanks doug burton"
3,I finally read the whole thing!,"This is a tale more philosophical than active. While Rice has a rich mythology to draw from, she seems rather too preoccupied with the nature of the vampire vs. the nature of humanity. Is her protagonist damned at the start, or must he earn it?While Part Three ends with a climax, and Part Four should contain a denouement, it's more a rambling about pain and loneliness than any kind of wrap-up of the book's plot. I only intend to read the rest of the series because I am quite taken with the Taltos and am aware that the series merge."
5,Love Vampires and Anne Rice.,I'll admit that I didn't here about Anne Rice until I saw the two movies based on her books. I have been buying her books and this is a very good book. Its defiantly better than the movie because there is more of a story to indulge in and connect to.
4,"Pretty good, but it wasn't ""all that"".","I liked this book and it was well written. However it didn't capture my attention as much as I though it would. It was my 1st Anne Rice novel. I think her writing appeals to a specific type of reader. I'll probably read her other stuff, as well."
2,I wanted to like this book,"I really did. I like horror, history, New Orleans, vampires, plantations, etc. I have a degree in English Literature, just so you know I'm not an idiot. This book is not good. The story is not interesting. Why create this relationship between Louis and Lestat? It doesn't work. Why is the whole thing an interview? Just for a payoff in the end? Claudia is the only good character. There were so many things that could have been done to make this a great novel. It's not compelling. A writer who makes vampires boring is not a good writer."
1,Recommended by friend-last one of his recommendations I take,"This book rambles on endlessly about Louis's angst, his troubled soul (or lack thereof) and yet nothing really happens in this dreary book. The narrative is painful to read. Ann Rice needs 1) psychiatric help, 2) to learn to write a good sentence and 3) to learn to develop some tension/expectation (and plot) in a book. I only finished this because I kept assuming that *it must get better!* It never did. Don't bother with this one."
2,"There's smoke, but no cigar","Promises, but none kept! It entices with the intresting tale of Louis, a Louisiana plantation owner in the 1800's. Louis is made into a vampire by another vampire, Lestate. Louis' struggle with killing human to live and his resistance to give up human emotions makes him a likable guide through the world of vampires. The mysteries of vampires origins creates suspense, and when Louis leaves with a child vampire, Claudia, to discover them, the book flopps. Louis only runs around in circles in his mind about death. While one long anguishing muse is acceptable, a book cannot live on confusion alone. Had Ann Rice carried on with the plot moving vibrant painting she began with, this would have been a facinating book. Unfortunatly, I only finished the book because I hoped for awnsers to the questions asked in the beginning, but none were to be found. Bottom Line: Don't start reading it, you'll be stuck reading a book that reminds you of a long, draining dream."
4,Very Interesting,This book was very well written. I really enjoyed it and wished that I would have read it before I saw the movie. I did not like The Vampire Lestat compared to this book at all. I wish it would have been more like this book.
2,Could Barely Finish,"While I know that this book is considered by many to be a great classic, when I read it I literally had to force myself to finish this book over the course of a month, when normally it would have taken me a matter of days. The writing dragged on and on and on with little details and events I could have cared less about. The characters did not appeal to me, except for Claudia and """"SOILER"""" she was killed off rather quickly, compared to the rest of the book. The only thing that attracted me to her was her determination and more ruthless personality than Lestat and Louis, who were, in my honest opinion, too effeminite for me to greatly like. I suppose the overall story is interesting, but it is so lost in a web of mind-numbing writing and weak characters that it was impossible for me to enjoy in any way."
1,Not an Anne rice fan here!,"I didn't like Anne's usage of words. I felt like I was being bombarded by feelings rather than the story. I'm a fan of Stephen King and Michael Chirchton. Now those two guys make you see the book, not just read it. I like seeing my books. She just didn't cut it, well.....at least not for me. I'm not going to have the slightest problem staying away from the rest of the chronicles, or any of Anne Rice's work for that matter."
4,Genre Defining,"Anne Rice does a remarkable job of describing the characters. We are able to see the complex nature of each person, their own struggles and of course the fight or embracing of taking in the liquid that allows them to live.I would rate this particular book in along with the classic tale of Dracula and as a must read for any vampire fiction fan."
5,The New-Classic Masterpiece,""" 'I see...' said the vampire thoughtfully,"" With that simples words Anne Rice trap me on her mistical web of dramatical terror. A sensual novel wich take you on a magical trip to Darkness with the sense for the immortality of death and the love for life. Is a stairway in wich every step gives you a melancolical expression of what happiness and love and wisdom means. With her sexy style, Anne Rice, has become a heroine for vampires' lovers who try find the elegance, beauty and seduction that this creatures deserve, making of them gods beyond the human race. No other vampire novel can be compare with this one. I personally invite you to enter to this fascinating world of ancient blood and live the experience of what is to live forever on a dead body and be part of the confusing evil that sorround this entities. Drink and live forever... Be a vampire."
4,"Fabulous book, a little bit dissapointing","I loved it, but having seen the film first I expected more. Without the book the film is worth 5 stars and without the film the book is, but each is missing a part of the magic of the other. Still, you should see and read both! You'll be happy you did.Most people like the characters of Louis or Lestat the best, but I liked Armand most. You see, in the film Louis seemes human, but in the book he turns into a monster. He thinks that Armand feels nothing, but I think that he is only diffrent. Wouldn't you be diffrent after 400 years? Louis feels like a human being before he meets Armand, but in the end HE is the one who feels nothing. Well, that's my opinion, maybe I got the whole thng wrong:P"
5,Love and Angst for all Eternity,"Anne Rice is the acknowledged queen of goth horror.Louis and Lestat are the quintessential eternal lovers. Their story is one of tragic heartache.If you are one of the five people in the world who hasn't yet read this poignant love story, one that rivals Romeo and Juliet, then you best get your act together.There's a reason they tapped Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise to star in the leading roles. No one else could possibly do justice to these characters. (and they only barely pulled it off)Eternal love, drama and centuries long angst to a degree never before put to paper. If only real life were this tragic."
2,THIS BOOK HAS NOTHING TO SAY!,"I just finished this book yesterday and I very much agree with the viewer from Walnut Creek. Anne Rice does a good job of invoking the mood, making you feel like you're one with the characters. But when I finished it, I realized that somehow this book seems incomplete.....and what it lacks is substance. I didn't feel like I had read some great story when it was over....I just felt like I'd read many detailed descriptions of events but with no real ""solid-story"" foundation behind it."
4,A great vampire novel,"A friend recommended this book to me and I quickly ran to the book store to pick it up. Happily I was not dissappointed.The basic plot is a vampire name Louis is telling his story to a young journalist. He tells of how he wished to die as a mortal, but instead is turned into a vampire by a vampire named Lestat. Louis tells of his psychological struggles with what he is and his search for exactly what the vampires' origins are. Lestat is not very helpful in this area, leading Louis to believe that Lestat knows nothing; soon Louis goes to leave Lestat forever. However, Lestat changes a young girl named Claudia into a vampire, knowing Louis would never leave her, and thus would never leave him. The story continues with much more action and excitement, often making the story hard to put down.Anne Rice is amazingly good at detail and describing how the mind thinks and acts. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a stirring new vampire novel."
2,Stop your whinging Louis!,"Firstly, I'll comment on the negative - the angst from Louis. What a moaner, whinger, whiner. Complain and the ""oh, woe is me"", just got too much. Lestat - couldn't you have picked someone else to spend eternity with?? I just hated that Louis character.Didn't like the writing... blah, blah, blah. I guess since this was my first romantic horror goth type book, I didn't know what to expect. I found it hard yakker getting through this novel, but did it as I was halfway through when the hype hit about a movie being made, based on the story.The positive - Lestat, how a vampire should be. Beautiful and flawed. So selfish, and so he should be. So manipulative, and should be after spending years roaming the world.Conclusion - not in a huge hurry to read another Rice book. If I found one in my bookshelf and I had nothing else to read, I may consider it."
1,Pseudo Gothic colorless prose with a ridiculous plot,"""Interview with the Vampire"" reads like Shakespeare on acid. The language and structure of the writing is reminiscent of some of the great Gothic horror novels but falls far short of capturing their intensity. The plot moves along like a two legged turtle, however even a faster pace would hardly make up for the lackluster story and rather tedious detail to which the reader is subjected. Particularly frustrating was the continued use and reuse of pseudo biblical language. This book failed to capture either my imagination or even my attention. If you plan to read this book, make certain to allow for frequent breaks"
1,Book,"The story ""Interview With a Vampire"" was really good but the quality of the book was poor. When I opened the first page the cover fell off and I was worried this would happen with every page. In the end it cost me $7.00 with shipping. I should have bought a new one."
1,If only I could give zero stars...,"This book was downright horrible. One big, long, boring angst fest. The author just ranbles on and on and on about even the most trivial things in the book. Besides, the characters are all Mary Sues. If you don't know what a Mary Sue is, look it up.NOT reccomended. Check it out from the library first if you feel you really must read this drivel for yourself."
1,Hardly a classic,"Reading reviews online, I was under the impression that this was a fantasy classic and a very worthwhile read. So as I progressed through the book, thinking very little of every single character and not much caring what happened to them, I didn't put it down, but kept going, thinking that something better must be on the next page.Not so. The characters are not sympathetic in the least and the plot is uneventful. I don't know anyone that I could recommend this book to in good conscience - so in my opinion, don't waste your time or money. There are plenty of good books out there, but this isn't one of them."
1,O my God - I love this book!!!!!!!!,"NOT!!! OK - it was just boring. There was too much about the tedious vampires like Louis, who is just pathetic, and all the others, who are sad. Don't read it, and don't end up like some kind of schizo who falls in love with Lestat. See the movie, if you want to, or if you fancy Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise (warning - they both look like drowned rats in this film, and consequently pretty rough), or Christian Slater. OK - that's it.Adios amigos (I'm not Spanish, by the way)"
1,UGH!,"After everyone's review I thought, wow this must be a great book. Boy was I wrong what a WASTE OF MONEY. This was the first book that I picked up written by Anne Rice and it is my last."
5,reggie's review,this was one of whodini's greatest albums it had single after single on the radio.I use to party hard off of songs from this album.great party music
2,I wish I hadn't listened to the other reviews,"I don't see it ... what the other reviewers exaulted about, must be friends.I read a lot of books, this one and another I purchased by this author are at most lead weights. Sparse, sketchy and cryptic. I read to learn not because I already know. If you really want to try this book BUY mine, 2 weeks old / half price.Ken - remember the English 101 chocolate chip cookie paper, write to convey."
2,Not for teaching,I showed this to my students and it scared the s**t out of them. An extremely counter-productive experience!
4,A treat for the senses,"What can I say? I enjoyed this book. The second person style does take a little getting used to, but I liked reading about the different locales, the professor and Laura's honesty about her life. Really folks, let's not judge! Who wants to read a book about someone who is perfect? No conflict in that."
4,An Italian Affair by Laura Fraser,"This book is about a woman coming to terms with the sudden end of her marriage.Laura Fraser wrote this book the same way life is lived. It is very poignant, graphic, detailed and mezmerizing.The author also showed how life can be completely different in another person's eyes.Go and read this book. It is worth the time of day."
2,Derivative and pointless,"Does every American divorced woman take off for Italy immediately following her receipt of the final decree dissolving her marriage? And does every one of them find true love in that country?There have been too many similar books published just ahead of this one for there to be anything innovative about the theme here.And author Laura Fraser has written this book entirely in the second person, like a beauty article in a hackneyed women's magazine. (The whole work scans to, ""First, you take an egg and you mix in a bit of good olive oil, then you spread it on your face."""") After a couple of pages, boy, does this self-conscious styling get tiring!I cannot agree with the majority of other Amazon readers who posted complimentary reviews about this book; I found AN ITALIAN AFFAIR to be predictable, stilted and, altogether, a waste of time."
1,Hypocritical and irritating,"Okay, let me get this straight: the narrator's heart is broken when her husband commits adultery, so she goes to Italy and mends said broken heart by sleeping with a MARRIED MAN???? How do you spell hypocrite? Sorry, I abandoned this one as soon as her clothes came off. She is not sympathetic in the least, and that second person narration is incredibly irritating. Maybe she refers to herself as ""you"" in order to get some distance from her guilt.The travel descriptions are nice, at least in the first few chapters. But go to Italy instead. You'll feel better about yourself in the morning."
5,mmhmm,Well this Cd is Amazing.. The Lyrics are amazing.. The Singer's voice is just Brilliant!! It's something new for everyone.. get it !!! Buy it!! its happy-sad-lonely all kinds of music in one!
1,Don't bother buying it!,"I have been collecting hammered aluminum for many years and can honestly say that this is the worst book that I have ever seen on the subject. It is riddled with inaccuracies of fact and misrepresentations. I could write a book on the inaccuracies found in this book. If you do anything more than look at the pictures, you will likely not learn much. His research techniques were useless at best. This book is full of fairy tales!"
4,Good general resource book on collectible aluminum ware,"This book has pictures and descriptions of the many different pieces of aluminum giftware. Grist gives a history of the aluminum industry and development of the market for aluminum ware. A thumbnail sketch of major manufacturers and artisans is provided. The book includes a price guide with the photos, but I felt the author was NOT clear as to why some articles were more valuable than others. Hand drawn representations of the marks and indices of various makers were shown. Basic index included for researching. An excellent book for some one endeavoring to learn something about the history of aluminum ware as well the types of collecticles available with current prices. A good general reference work for antique dealers, generalists and aluminum collectors."
3,"Good, but incomplete!","While this book may have been the definitive bio on the Beatles in 1968, because it was written before the group broke up it leaves out alot of important info on the band such as Brian's homosexuality and other facts about the band that could not be made public at the time. I highly recommend this book for those of you who have recently discovered the Beatles and are looking for a great overview. Then you will be ready for the ""truth"" behind the greatest rock band of all time! Don't forget to order you copy of ""Anthology"" which is due out soon!"
4,A fascinating history,"Yergin provides a highly readable acccount of how oil has driven so much of modern history. I especially found his chapters on World War II interesting; the degree to which a need for oil drove Hitler's war plans, as well as those of the Japanese and Americans. It's an aspect of the war that war historians don't pay much attention to but it's incredibly important. This approach provides insights into other areas of world affairs that make it worth struggling through the book's considerable length."
3,A lenthy socio-political historical narritive,"The Prize is a lengthy historical narrative. ""Historical"" means that the book concentrates on politics and social implications, with minimal attention to technological developments (i.e., viturally no mention of the science or technology of oil production). ""Narrative"" means that it isn't always specified exactly who did what when, and coverage is erratic and fagmented. So, while fascinating, this is not a reference. The reader does not get a reasonably complete history of any specific oil company or producing area."
5,Excellent book,History's back story (and often its lead story) is well crafted and documented as Yergin takes the readers from the oilfields of Titusville up until the first Gulf War (in the version I read). It is very long but well worth the effort.
4,Too bad about the singer,If this band had a better singer with better lyrics then i would give it 5 stars. Everything thing else about it is good. The problem with the singer is that he mumbles to much and his lyrics are dull and repetive especially on i want to be adored. Another problem with this cd it is way to long i usually end up skipping the last two songs.
5,Luv Luv Luv this stuff...,I love this stuff - I just never seem to buy enough when I am in Hawaii. It is great for outdoors and tanning beds!!
1,"Right cover, wrong book","I received ""A Summer Bird-Cage"" in the mail from Amazon and Better World books, with the pink cover shown above. I opened it up, and the inside is a novel called ""Raine On Me"" by Laurann Dohner. Never heard of her, from the few pages I attempted to read, I can tell she is no Margaret Drabble! Never ordered a bound paperback and ended up with a different book inside the cover before!"
5,Prostate supplement,"Of all the prostate aids I've tried, this one seems to help. I will probably order another supply. Works for me."
1,Too little for too much money,"Don't let the hefty pricetag fool you -- this book is tiny, offering about 85 pages of material in total, and these are small pages, about 8 by 5.5 inches.While that makes this book a convenient size to toss into your purse, it hardly justifies the $34.00 ($40.00 list) price."
5,BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY!!! WONDERFUL BOOK!!,"If you want a funny, heartwarming, magical love story, then READ Sarbina's Destiny! I couldn't put it down for one minute. I have read the reviews on line, and they all have given this book a thumbs up or 5 Stars!Jason and Sabrina will make you laugh, cry at times and make you hold your breath with the well written sexual tension. I loved Jason's dad, the Inn's employees and especially the Angels!What a great book. It's the type of book that mom's and grandmothers can even read, and even if you don't usually read paranormal it's okay, you will still love this book.5 STARS"
4,Lots of fun; great disco music!,"This is the first exercise dvd i ever bought, and although I own several, it's the one I come back to the most. The workouts are easy to do, and with 5 workouts to pick from I can mix it up and do something different every day without getting bored. The routines vary in length from 5 minutes to 30 minutes, and also includes a Beginner workout with easier exercises. I like that she uses real disco hits instead of tacky ""soundalikes""; however, some workouts use instrumental dance-techno music instead. There's also a countdown clock that I find helpful as well. Some of the reviewers here have mentioned that Cheryl's cueing isn't the best and I have to agree- sometimes if I'm not watching carefully I fall behind for a moment or get mixed up with what I'm doing. But- her enthusiasm and excitement makes up for it and I always find myself having a good time when I'm working out to this dvd."
1,diappointed,This video was disappointing. It started out too fast and it was hard to keep up. I thought it would be primarily for abs. but it wasn't. I only viewed it once and put it away. I plan to sell it at my next garage sale. Should have purchased a better video for abs.
2,Only good if you're a dancer!,"I tried out the ""Disco Abs"" routine by Cheryl Burke on Exercise TV, which I assume is part of this DVD package. I was disappointed in the program, although it looked to be fun at the start, at least for the music (which I DID enjoy). However, from a workout point-of-view this program didn't do it for me. I like aerobics routines where the moves are simple to learn and follow, and don't require advanced ability and comfort with fancy dance choreography. Unfortunately, as a result this program turned out to be pretty much everything I DISLIKE as a result. I was quickly lost by the dance moves even after multiple viewings and attempts to pick them up. As a result I spent more time trying to catch up with the moves than burning calories. Maybe the full DVD package has more of a warm-up or basic guide to the moves?I feel like this might be a good workout for those already familiar with disco dancing and enjoy it, but for the rest of us? Not so much."
3,Great for smaller hands!,"I have had this controller for almost three months, and it works perfectly. If standard controllers are too big this one is for you. Once I switched to this controller I was able to hit combos faster, aim better, and play with less fatigue."
2,too much and too small,The translation and conjugation on the cards and the cards themselves were too small to read quickly or handle. Need something larger if you are going to put that much on one card.
2,A MAJOR Disapointment.,"The preview said ""from the filmmakers of 'The Prince of Egypt'"", so I was interested. But then I saw it. And while ""The Prince of Egypt"" was a masterpiece of animation, and as a pure movie as well, this is BADBAD!!!!!! The songs are mediocre, the voice casting is mediocre, and the animation is only decent, while ""The Prince of Egypt"" is totally opposite. And don't get me wrong, Ben Affleck is a good actor, but........well, lets just say he should stick to live action. And never take on a singing role again! It's boring, too! The story line doesn't have enough action, and dwells too much on drama, and almost has nothing to do with God, except for a few mentionings of Him. This is too bad, since it is based on a Bible story. Maybe I'm comparing it too much with ""The Prince of Egypt"", but I stick to my review. Go rent that instead, and if you've already seen it a bunch of times, then see it again; anything's better than waisting your time with this ."
2,Nothing comparing Prince of Egypt,"I was so disappointed. The songs are sooooooooooo boring, and the graphic are not so good... It's nothing comparing The Prince of Egypt. I won't buy it... that's for sure."
2,Prince of Egypt it is not,"DreamWorks first straight-to-video release is the sequel to The Prince of Egypt. I got a screener copy of this one and I have to say that it really can't compare to it's predecessor. Ben Affleck plays the title role and the voice acting is about the best thing you'll find here. The kids will surely wander off after the first song or so and Joseph doesn't have the action sequences to bring them back in. If your kids don't have exceptional attention spans, you might want to leave this one on the shelf."
3,Okay movie,"We bought this movie recently. I have watched it before, but I guess this time I paid more attention. The movie is good, the cartoons and everything else is fine, the only thing that I did not like, is the story line. I don't think is bible based, I would rent it and watch it before I buy it. It had little things in the story that bothered me, that I really know are not bible based. I understand that they have to make it into a story for a movie but I think this movie does not tell the story in the way that is depicted in the bible."
4,Finally,"I remember owning this project on cassette back in the 80's. I probably wore it out I played it so much. Not only does this recording feature amazing music by some of the best CCM artists of the time, but it delivers a refreshing message about greed and materialism within the Christian world which sadly, fell on deaf ears during its time. A true gem and a classic, I'm thrilled to see it being offered for download."
5,Perfect for home use,"Easy to assemble, fits great and perfect for light-duty home use. I needed a hard hat for working in my low-pitched attic. Can't beat the price, either."
5,recollections of rifleman harris,"a famous book, on Napoleonic wars full of detail and personal views of both armies, fought to death but there was chilvalry"
2,Not Worth the Money,"Our while family found this toy incredibly annoying, and it doesn't move around much. My daughter was bored with it after the first day. Also, if you have small animals, be prepared for them to freak out!"
1,Conner's Mommy,My son received this as a Christmas present when he was about 8 months old. As long as it was turned off he seemed somewhat interested in it but once we turned it on the toy terrified him. We decided to put it away and perhaps try it again at about 10 months. Big mistake. The jerky motion of the ball and the noise combined with the fact it repeatedly hits him in the face still terrifies him. Perhaps he will like it in a couple years.
1,Most hated toy by entire family,"The erratic movements of the ball scare my son. It's also VERY LOUD, EVEN ON THE LOWEST VOLUME SETTING, IT IS OBNOXIOUS."
2,Vtech activity ball,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 7 months old. She didn't like it because it made to much noise and whether she touched it or not it was singing, lighting up,and moving. I thought she might like it when she got older, but she still doesn't. I don't blame her. I don't know how this could be educational, when you press a button it doesn't consistently give a response, which is confusing for children in the age group it targets. The only thing I liked about it was the two level volume control, although it was still too loud for little ears."
2,Not eye catching enoungh.,Bought this a gift because I heard it was great. My 9 month old grandson wasn't too interested in it. I think it need to more lights to attract his attention.
4,new mom and lovin it,"This ball is fun. My 7 month old likes to watch this thing go. One problem we have with it though is when it lands on the number 2, which is a square, it sometimes gets stuck there and can't get moving again on it's own. You can hear it trying to go but it can't get off the 2 without a little help."
1,Skip this toy!,"I got this for my son at about 5 months. He loves music and sounds and I thought the colors were bright and fun. Soon I found out, my son didn't feel the same. You get the sad crumple face before the crying of sheer TERROR! We hid the ball for months, and recently brought it back out since my son is 8 months and crawling we thought maybe it was scary because he wasn't able to move after it. WRONG again. He hates it, not just enough to ignore it, but enough to literally TRY avoiding it all together. When it sings he cries, when it wiggles at him he cries.This thing is worthless."
2,words not clearly pronounced,"Ball is very heavy, can dent wood floors if dropped from a table. The words that it tries to teach sounded garbled and unclear. My son 10 months shows some interest in it, but does not keep his attention for more than 4 minutes."
1,Couldn't be less interested...,"I got this toy when my daughter was 6 months and since then she couldn't be less interested, she is currently 11 months and hasn't played with it once, i wish I wouldn't have wasted my money1. It's too heavy to pic up2. It's spontanious, it moves around and will hit the baby, which scares her3. How is a 6 month old supposed to find the letter/number/ animal in time, it only gives you 30seconds maybeIt's just not what I expected"
2,My dog hates this toy.,"No, this toy was not purchased for my dog, but for my 10 month old son. It was a gift, but my son really doesn't care about crawling--he would much rather pull up and cruise. The ball doesn't encourage him to crawl after it either. The audio is annoying and constant--even if he's not playing with it, it talks/sings constantly--""Hey, come play with me!"". The sound quality is very poor because the voice sounds slurred. Our dogs have been tolerant of all the noisemaking toys that have been brought into our house due to the baby, but one of the dogs hates this toy. She growls at it whenever it talks. I would not recommend it for older babies."
2,Not Worth It,"There is allot going on with this toy. Loud noises, movement, different lights and textures. Almost TO much. My daughter bats it around sometimes for a few minuets then gets fussy and leaves it. I tried giving it to my girlfriend and her baby had the same reaction. Wish I didn't purchase it. We have had it for a few months and she still doesn't like it."
4,5 month old loves it,"I picked this toy up after my then 4 1/2 month old son enjoyed playing with it while at a friend's house. He's not a huge fan of toys, but absolutely loves this ball! I honestly don't think it will aid in crawling at all though as the ball doesn't move all that much. It is heavy, and if your baby is prone to picking things up and throwing them then it may break easily.Overall, I really like this toy. I see him having a lot of fun with it for quite a few months."
3,music ball,"didnt buy it from amazon, but product is ok overall, my son is 8 months, he can play with it for 5-10 min, but finds it boring and prefers another musical ball that he can grab on to. this one does not entertain him long enough"
2,"Overall, not worth buying","Looke really neat, but our 10 month old twin boys are not interested in it at all and it doesn't roll very well (yes, we're using it on hard floors). It even gets stuck in one place all the time. Your money would be better spent on something else."
5,Hours of fun,This is a great toy for little ones right at crawling age. Those who can't crawl yet would get frustrated when it rolls away from them.
1,Dangerous toy,"This ball is heavy and made of hard plastic. When my baby dropped it on her big toe, her toe turned black and blue. This ball went in the trash after that incident."
1,Son is TERRIFIED of this toy,I turned this on for my 8 month old and he is TERRIFIED of it. I thought it was a fluke so I tried again a few weeks later. No go. He crawled as fast as he could away from it and was inconsolable. I had to donate it. Every time he caught a glimpse of it he starts crying and gets very scared. So strange.... It does sound a little creepy to me.
3,Could be better,"I was eagerly awaiting this movie as I loved Leslie Nielsen, even before he was a comedy star. Was looking forward to a couple of belly-laughs but alas, I found only a couple of chuckles. Nielsen only had a peripheral role. I think David Zucker tried too hard to incorporate every Liberal caricature known to him and missed the point, which was to make people laugh, for which he is famous. There was no time to allow the situations to develop. Would like to see a mulligan along the same lines but with more emphasis on the laughs."
1,Blu-Ray won't run past previews,I rented the Blu-Ray from Netflix. The disc would not play past the previews. I upgraded the firmware on my Blu-Ray player. It still wouldn't play. I sent the disc back to Netflix convinced the disc was damaged. The replacement disc would not run either! Copyright protection ruins what could be potentially a funny movie.
2,WAYYYYY too detailed!!!!,"This book is FAR too dense to be useful on the clinical wards. Essentially, it is filled with a whole lot of excessive facts which have no clinical relevance, nor relevance to Steps 2 or 3. I would not recommend the money, get Step 2 Secrets instead, farrrrrr more practical for ward survival and board review. However, if you are looking to work your trap muscles...this is the sole purpose for this text!"
2,What about the screen?,"The reason I wanted a thin soft case was obviously not to protect my ipod against bumps and drops, but rather, to protect the screen -- the video screen -- from scratches. I really don't mind if the back gets scratched or the click wheel gets a scratch on it... I want the screen to be free of scratches so I can watch video clearly. When this case came, I was confused and shocked to learn that someone would make a case that protects every part from scratches except the screen. I'm sure if I go back and read the product description, this is explained somewhere and I just missed it. However, it baffles me what the purpose is of protecting everything but the screen. I'm obviously going to have to read the descriptions better as I look for a an ipod cover to protect the screen."
5,Hilarious,This is the perfect book for kids in grades 2-4. It is so funny and typical of how boys and girls at this age think-generally. What a great introduction into a fun writing project. It is wonderful how the boy and girl come together to form their stories into something they can both enjoy and what a great read aloud! Fun illustrations!
4,4 yr old daughter loves this,"My 4 year old absolutely loves this book. She's a girl who loves princesses, dinosaurs and pirates. And I am sooooo sick of princesses. This book was refreshing for me to read aloud versus reading same old princess stories. And, I love that their are two characters, a girl AND a boy working together to create the story. It's good for her to see that two differing points of view can still collaborate and create something worthwhile."
1,BIG YAWN! Juvenile script and an insult to your intelligence!,"If you would like to see more cheese than at a Wisconsin cheese factory tour, this is your miniseries.Let's face it I had to laugh at the instantaneous way the characters fall in love every time they look at each other.And where are the minorities? Well, wait 90 minutes for the waiter to serve the white people drinks at the party!And then there's a car chase that has to be the worst that has ever been filmed! Don't waste your time, you might fall asleep.I guess I just don't like this type of cheesy soap."
1,"Not that complete, certainly not a guide","At best this book explains the fundamental operation of common motorcycle parts: fork action, the 4 stroke cycle, etc. It reads like an 8th grader's textbook and is not in depth enough to be put to any practical use. I bought the book blindly, expecting it to be in depth to some degree (it was THE textbook for MMI at the time, after all). What a dissapointment."
3,A new Edition is Needed,The book is good but is becoming quite dated. For those using SQL Server 2005 it is a little disappointing because SQL Server architecture has changed so much. Its overall value is reduced by this.
4,Not outdated,I suspect the above review to be a plant by a competitor. I used these cards in the 1980's as a student. Suggesting that a 1000+ year old language has changed dramatically in 30 years is something only a dumbkopf would assert.
4,Great review of a variety of techniques,Very practical book with clear descriptions and lots of photos. Start of book has great primer on anatomy. Highly recommend for residents or those in practice looking to expand their scope of plastics.
1,SoulMaid - Instant Video,"absolutely the worse movie i have ever seen in my entire life; do not waste time or money of this movie, trust me on this."
3,Hard to follow at times but decent,"This comic was not that bad. I did write bad things about it before, but then I went back and took a second read through. I think the main problem that I had with it was the fact that I hadn't read any of the stories leading up to it. After going online and looking them up, I reread the book and I have this to say. It is adequate. It isn't the greatest thing ever written, but it is ok. If you want to buy, then do so. It is an ok story."
3,Zero Hour: Crisis in Time tpb(trade paper back or graphic novel),"Compelling story. Involves time travel so lots of crazy things happen. Heroes past, present, different earths and different times and dimensions. Universe ends- starts to rebuild by crazy person- then another ""big bang"" to recreate the original universe and timeline."
3,Interesting,"Zero Hour changed DC Comics forever back when it was first released. It did a good job of clearing up a lot of continuity errors that were left after Crisis, but also added a lot of unneceserry items such as Catwoman's new origin. The use of Hal Jordan as a villain was a good tool, but at the same time wasted decades of great continuity used for this special character in order to attract more readers. Scenes that were memorable were Ollie Queen killing his best friends and The heroes themselves creating the big bang.It would have recieved 5 stars if these events were spread farther throughout the story instead of at the last ten pages."
1,Didn't work with iTouch or Nano 3G,"Very poor quality item for this price, also didn't work with iTouch, Ipod Classic or Nano 3g. Don't waste your money"
2,The two and a half review!,"This movie was quite sad. It was sad because this evil guy tried to hurt this kid's mom. The kid was sad, too. Then Mr.Strauss comes in and makes life worse for them because he makes the kids go back to where the evil guy was. The kid almost got hurt. It was sad.Altogether, this movie was sad."
5,Quick service.,This item was received promptly and packaged well. This will be a birthday present for my mother this September 26th.
5,this great story continues....,I chose this rating because the author has done a great job of continuing w/the story. It did not get old and continued in a well thought out way.I definitely will get the next book in this series.
4,Interesting reading,"A new day rising is the second in a series by Lauraine Snelling. This author was recommended by someone who had read the series and enjoyed them. I liked the details of this immigrant couple's trip from the Nordland area of Norway in the 1880s to Minnesota and North Dakota, similar to my wife's grandfather's voyage, which made the story so true to life. The author has done an excellent job of researching material for this series. I read this series to my wife who had been an avid reader but lost her eyesight due to a stroke. We both enjoyed all of this series."
2,DOESNT LAST LONG !! ONLY ONE MONTH,My sisters phonecame with a battery ofcourse and it lasted for about 2/half years & then just died.So i bought so about a month ago when it wouldnt start it is an cheap price which means i ordered in july and today it has died again.So a month only isnt worth unless you want to keep your phone for a month and then get a new one. Doesnt last long at all. Better to just get a new phone.
2,Not good,This battery held a charge for less time than the one that originally came with it. Waste of your money.
5,Quality batteries for cheap,"When both our phones started having problems charging we knew it was time for new batteries. Local stores wanted $35 - $45 for replacements. Found them here for less than $5 each. Original equipment batteries, great price, fast shipping. Sure beats the local competetion!"
1,BAIT & SWITCH!!!,"Sadly, I read the reviews after I placed my order for the Slim Li Ion Battery for the Motorola RAZR V3. I saw where BargainCell had substituted a cheaper BR 50 battery. Well, they did that on my order and now it's going back.The BR 50 received even worse reviews and is available for $0.67 all over the internet. YES, THAT'S 67 CENTS!Stay away from these scammers at BargainCell."
1,Razor Cell Phone Battery,"I received my battery within 3 days, however the life span of the battery was about 2 weeks and then it died! I was thankful I only paid $5 for it! I suggest putting the money into buying a new battery vs. buying from amazon!"
1,Second failure,"I bought this Razar battery through Amazon and received it in non-working form. My experience with Amazon has not been good. Despite the above items might not be expensive purchases, I expect to get service for the money I have spent, especially in these bad economic times. I wish that Amazon would check the merchandise before releasing it to customers."
2,Old,"Really old batteries.As they say, I guess sometimes you do get what you pay for.Cheap and work but not good battery life."
3,A long time getting here!.,"It took a long time to get here. But if finaly did arrive, and it is the right item. I had to make a number of e-mail inquires to track it down. But then again, It did get here."
1,New Batteries,Batteries installed and it was noted that they displayed RED on phones battery indicator. Neither battery will hold a charge more than two days.
1,Defective Batteries,"I purchased a Li-Ion battery from Eforcity for my RAZR v3 phone. I posted the following feedback on February 13th: ""The battery had less capacity than the one it replaced, dying during a moderate length phone call starting at full charge. I switched back to the old battery.""Eforcity sent me another battery and requested that I remove my negative feedback. Well, someone removed the feedback but it wasn't me. And the replacement battery also dies after moderate phone calls.This has earmarks of trying to unload bad lots of batteries at bargain prices."
3,Battery Purchase,"The Battery arrived as promised, but the battery does hold charge for very long, that was the reason for replacing the battery I already had"
1,Beware!,The battery has not lasted longer than the one I wanted to replace which was one year old. Battery shipped without any retail packaging and looked used. There is no way this could be a new battery and only stay charged for such a short time
5,Razor Battery,I was leary about purchasing the battery because it cost so little. But I called the vendor and asked if it was a new battery and not used or re-conditioned. The vendor assured me it was a new battery. It has performed well so far.
3,Motorola Battery,"This battery is as good as the original...because it is an OEM battery...that being said I can't recommend it...pay the extra money for the higher capacity battery. I thought my original battery was going bad and bought this as a replacement...you need the higher capacity battery...the battery needs a charge almost every day...2 or 3 texts and you are down one bar on battery level, 1 look at the internet down 1 bar very fast..."
5,amazing price and works as expected,"I use it on Craftsman saw,works as expected at a fraction of an expected cost.. Even if it wan't last as long as the other blades, for this price I can afford frequent changes."
1,Poor indoor shots,"I recently bought one of these- It was to be my third digital camera from Olympus.it seemed a perfect fit for me, since my last camera died from me getting it wet.To start with the positive:The form factor is great, and it really feels solid.But the negative list is a bit longer:The controls are VERY basic, with only some static modes-- moreover it doesn't have a hardware switch for modes like the d-40 or 740uz. You have to use the LCD interface to do it.But the real problem with this camera was the indoor photo quality.I actually returned this camera, as I was VERY disappointed with the quality of the indoor pictures.Even self timer shots from a tripod were blurry!I got the 740UZ instead. it is WAY bigger, but at least it takes decent pictures.If you are going to buy this camera, make sure you buy it from amazon or another place with a good returns policy!"
3,Can I get a little low end! Badly produced.,"I love all Slayer albums, and this one with no exception...but...after many albums and many years, you would think PRODUCTION would be flawless. The first thing I noticed is that there hardly any bass/low end on this album. It takes away from an otherwise excellent effort. Not as bad as ""And Justice For All"" by Metallica...but pretty BAD however."
3,"Don't buy the ""Best Slayer CD since ******!"" hype","...don't get me wrong, it's pretty good.But ""Seasons in the Abyss"", this is not. Particularly because ""Seasons"" was fresh and interesting...this CD sticks a little too close to the old formula for my taste. There's nothing inherently wrong with it, but aside from ""Skeleton Christ"", nothing on this CD really got my blood pumping or got me altogether that interested.You'll buy it. Because it's Slayer, and that's fine. I did. It's a good record to listen to in the background."
5,Nu-Metal?! You've got to be kidding me!,"Nu-Metal doesn't have blazing riffs, blistering solos, and killer drumbeats, now does it? Slayer slipped up starting on ""Diabolus In Musica"", but now they have put out Christ Illusion, which is a throwback to the good ol' days of Reign in Blood and Seasons in the Abyss. Other than that, my opinion has already been said. This is an awesome album. Now we wait for United Abominations by Megadeth..."
3,"It's still good but come on, for slayer this album is slow.",I still like slayer for some reason. I like how they just dont care about protecting anyones feelings. They just sing about morbid angry society and are still hard hitters. For all those people out there saying this album is fast im not really sure where there getting that from. For slayer this album is on the slower side. Its not any better than god hates us all. In fact when i herd it thats what it sounded like to me. I still like the album but the guitar work has sloped down through the years and the intros arnt as cool as they used to be. This is still a good album but i had expected a little more especially waiting a few years to release a new album. If your looking for old school slayer you wont find much here but its still good to listen to new ideas.
2,Disheartening,"I love Slayer and have for years however other then the first track on here, I just didnt feel it with this album. Alot of it just sounds fast for the sake of being fast..Where are those riffs that make you want to throw a relative from a ten story window? A joke folks but as much as some people on here whine about God Hates Us All, I find that alubm much more interesting then this one. People whine about how Tom's voice was ""jarring"" and ""grating"" on God Hates. Look if you want phantom of the opera go somewhere else. Tom isnt a singer but what I like about his vocals is the feeling behind them. He honestly sounds like someone in torment..screaming and not giving a damn what people think about it.. I respect the brutality of it, most fans do. Look if you like Slayer then buy this album..however I will have to agree with one of the above commentaries, Jeff needs to start writing some material again. I think he balanced Kerry out, so hopefully that will happen sometime in the future."
1,MAJOR DISAPOINTMENT,"Being a long time Slayer fan since the early 80's, Slayer has really disappointed me recently, with all the lies, being hypricates, everything else.As For Christ Illusion-MAJOR DISAPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!..There is nothing good on this cd. Kerry/Jeff need to take guitar lessons. The riffs/songs are all recycled some really weird riffs. Besides the new Iron Maiden this will be the 2nd worst cd of 06Slayer really needs to start going on tour with some real metal bands. All this Nu-Metal bands they take out with them is embarrassing. They are starting to sound like them.I was really excited when I heard Dave was back in the band, going to record the new Slayer album, but his performance is also disappointing.If you are just getting into Slayer, buy anything up till Seasons, after that it is GAYER.Can't wait till Slayer do their show with Stryper...Way to go guys.......RIP SLAYER...RETIRE PLEASE"
3,good,"pretty good, a bit silly but I am sure kids really like it. Now I have to add works to meet the minimum."
3,Stretching a kids book into a full length film is hard to do,I think they made the Grinch a bit too vulgar (fart jokes and such) and maybe too creepy for some sensitive viewers. Its still a fun holiday movie to wrap presents while its playing in the background.
5,Love It,This movie has become part of our Christmas tradition! Truly brings us back to our childhood and a must see for the younger generation today.
1,Was This Even Necessary?,"The original Dr. Seuss Story on How The Grinch Stole Christmas was a mere half hour cartoon. The original cartoon version kept it simple without any extended sidebars and remains more successful.Ron Howard tries to exaggerate this story and more or less fails quite miserably. Jim Carrey tries his best but even he comes up short with his over-exaggerated antics. The other actors and actresses in Whoville just sit there and take up space. They just all look like a bunch of wierdos without adding an ounce of humor in this attempt at making a childhood story into an adult oriented comedy. Truthfully I wonder if this movie should have ever been made. Its not a children's tale with its crass language and scenes. And the humor is so cheap that any normal adult would find it sophmoric if not downright stupid.If you like a good Christmas fable, seek out the original cartoon. This mess of a movie just does not cut the mustard."
2,Color is off and the Disk is dirty,"When i got the Movie I noticed that the wrapping of the case isn't complete. Also there was ""Made in Mexico"" STAMPED on the Wrapping! The color of the movie is Dull and the disk is Dirty ""dust and filth"". I think the movie is Refurbished but it's not suposed to be."
4,Very entertaining,"I think this movie is hillarious. No it isn't the same as the original grinch (originals are always #1 IMO) but it's a great follow up. Jim Carrey brought a new spin on the character of the grinch. It's more contemporary but it's still has a basic outline of the original. In this movie the grinch is cold, angry, heartless but also comical despite his bitterness and it's refreshing. It has more of a hollywood spin on it but it doesn't mean it isn't good."
3,The Grinch - Widescreen Edition DVD,"Thought the film was a right laugh. Just one thing: Why is it the Theatrical trailer on the disc is a lot richer in colour and sharper than the actual film? It appears as though the black level has been raised making the transfer appear foggy. I can only assume this was an error made during transfer.Still... great film, great sound. Shame about the image."
2,"So Stupid, It's Funny","I love this movie! It is so incredibly stupid and funny. It is absolutely ridiculous and slightly crass. The grinch and the whos look like a bunch of clowns. The film was predictable and completely ripped off from the animated TV special. This isn't as stupid as Barney, because at least the makers of this film actually tried to be funny, rather than just childish and retarded. This film has gotten a lot of mixed reviews on amazon.com, so be sure to rent it before you buy it."
4,Recent Christmas Classic,"This is a great mix of CGI and traditional movie artistry. While the original animated version is my favorite because that's what I grew up watching, this version is wonderful as well. Anthony Hopkins was the perfect voice for the narrative and I can think of no other actor that could have pulled off the Grinch character as well as Jim Carrey has. This one is a must-see."
5,Jim Carey was born to play the grinch....,Ron Howard and Jim Carey brings a beloved christmas cartoon classic to life...the dr. suess world comes alive in this movie....the visual is stunning and this 2 disc set is packed with great features included the faith hill christms song where are you christmas...this is new classic and i love this version as much as the cartoon.
3,I JUST want to buy the GRINCH,"I'm a pack guy. I buy movies in apack. I loved the grinch, butnot the cat in the hat, I'd buythe Grinch without this pack,but I guess its hard to breakonce you're addicted. Maybe Ishould stop buying packs....""Ogres have layers"""
3,Decent,"It is a cute movie for kids but adult value is low. Kind of boring nice imagery and art, Jim looks great but not worth 2 hrs film time. I'd rent something else if you are an adult watching it w kids."
2,Too childish for my tastes but it has it's moments,"The Grinch was a great film if you're eight. But for everyone else it's okay. Granted, the sets were amazing, it has heart and Jim Carrey is brillaint but the film wasn't as funny I thought it could've been. The film is good family entertainment though."
5,bought for daughter,I bought it on VHS when it first came out. I kept it and a few months ago my 3 year old daughter discovered it and wanted to watch it. She watched it probably 20 times and the quality of the VHS started to fade...plus she dropped it and the flap thing fell off. So I decided to surprise her with a new DVD for Christmas and she was thrilled. She's watched it a couple times so far and we've had no problems. Cute movie.
3,It's okay I guess ?,Some parts were really sad and it's not funny at all either .So like I said it's not funny . I think their just trying to make people laugh so I really wouldn't recommend this film to everyone . I mean it's okay but that's all you know !!!But it's still a good christmas movie I MIGHT buy it ?
1,The Grinch That Stole Christmas,I'm sorry to say that this movie was so silly we didn't watch more tha 20 minutes of it before we turned it off. Maybe it's one of those movies that only a school aged child can appreciate? We were very disappointed with it.
2,Didn't watch the whole movie,"Im not sure what I was expecting, but this movie was just not very good to me. I guess I liked the original."
2,Just ok and Inappropriate,"Jim Cary is creepy as The Grinch. In one sceen with him ""naked"" and the way he moves around the little girl is scary and almost sexual. There are also some other ""odd"" scenes....and they way they portray that it seems ok for a little girl to go along to a wierd strange man's house is disturbing. I would not recommend."
3,Great movie,"Great movie, I wated my daughter to enjoyed one of Christmas' must have movies. It was of such poor resolution, maybe it's bc we watch everything in HD and BlueRay, but this movie looked like if was copied off a VHS."
5,Best Christmas movie ever!,"I didn't even want to see this movie, but we took our daughter who was 2 at the time. It was her first movie theater experience. We were nervous that she wouldn't sit still, but the entire movie kept her captivated. She loved it. And I actually loved it! There is enough silliness to keep kids interested, but enough subtle humor to entertain adults as well. Jim Carrey is awesome in this movie. This one is definitely going into our movie collection!"
5,Great Christmas movie for the family,I love this version and recommend it for all families to enjoy for the holiday seasons. Jim Carrey does an excellent job inthis film and makes the cartoon look like childs play. Very funny movie
5,My favorite Holiday movie EVER!,"The title says it all. GREAT family Christmas movie, I love it!!!! It will become apart of our family tradition every year."
1,A real stinker,"First of all, i don't see any reason for this movie to have been made. The half-hour cartoon was by far better made and more memorable. 30 minutes is all it takes to tell the story of a Scrooge-like character who get his Christmas comeuppance. We really don't need all the back-ground fill, childhood experiences, and toilet humor (a sleeping mayor being duped into kissing a dog's backside - and this is a kid's movie?!) to pad out a simple holiday tale. Not fun. Not amusing. Just dull dull dull!"
3,Christmas,"I love Jim Carrey and especially this film. It speaks directly to our soulChildren and remind us that Christmas is not just a celebration in honor ofobjects but also a time of sharing and love.Image: The quality is good without reaching the summits.Sound: It's Christmas without a reference.Packaging: green suits him so well.Feel free to offer your children, they will love it."
3,good enough to entertain the kid,"It was good enough to entertain the kids, but the adults found it a bit tedious. The original story of the Grinch is great, but to make it into a feature film, a whole backstory of the Grinch's childhood was added."
5,Merry Christmas,Jim Carrey...no one could have done what he did in this movie to bring the Grinch to life. I couldnt tell you how many times I have watched this movie. I do recommend it!! Ron Howard did really good.
5,The Grinch Steals Your Heart,Very pleased with this movie. I already owned it in VHS so wanted DVD to replace it. A truly great Jim Carrey movie with Jim at his best....super funny!
1,Glitzy Green Garbage,"I didn't know what to think of this film when I saw it, so I saw it with a pretty open mind. It stunk. This is the most wandering, stupid, over-budgeted waste I have seen in a long time. Jim was given plenty to do, largely because he had to fill-in a character who didn't exist on the script. The town is composed of vaccuous rat-faced idiots, and and a meandering plot searching for somthing to say beyond Christmas involving spending money, and The Grinch not liking it. What a waste!"
5,Love it!,The Grinch is my favorite Christmas story. When I heard it was going to be done and have Jim Carey in it I was thrilled. I love this story. I'm very happy it has come out on Bluray combo pack.
5,Christmas Delivered,I chose this rating because there is nothing wrong with this product and I got it cheaper than I would have online at places such as Walmart or Kmart. I recommend this product to anyone and everyone because it is one that all ages will surely enjoy!
5,Jim Carrey's Grinch,"Who doesn't love this version? I'm not a big Jim Carrey fan, but this is a Christmas must-see for our family every year."
3,A fun christmas film but it's why to long,I found this film enjoyable and fun to watch every christmas but it's not the greatest film. I found the film to long it draged on and on and the film is noisey and bussy. The make-up is really good. The acting is really good espesailly Jim Carrey. Overall it's a good film.
3,I still like the original best!!!,"Although I throughly enjoyed the ""new"" Grinch movie...I still get more of a kick out of the cartoon original! The initial part of the movie was interesting and gave a new twist to why the Grinch was Grinchy (the Grinch is thwarted in love and made fun of by school mates). The relationship that develops with Cindy Lou who is really quite brillant...the special effects and costumes are great, and Mr. Carrey is excellent along with rest of the cast...I'm still not out my childhood yet apparently! I love the cartoon antics, the extreme facial expressions on the cartoon Grinch and side kick dog! Thus my rating!"
1,One of the five worst movies I've ever seen,"It sucks. It sucks. It sucks. Took one of the greatest animated movies of all time, added meaningless psychobabble to a story that was supposed to tell us about the possibility for reform in all of us and tried to make us feel sorry for the grinch, thereby avoiding the principal idea - even the WORST person can become better. HORRID film. NO redeeming qualities at all. Not worth sitting through. Not worth watching. If you buy it, burn it. I can't believe I had to give this film a star at all."
2,How bad can you make it!,"Being a long time fan of DR. SUESS's true version of the Grinch, you wouldn't think they could destroy the story that badly but, congratulations Ron you've succeeded. Don't get me wrong I really enjoy watching Jim Carrey acting or a Ron Howard film. The only reason it got two stars out of me is because no one could've played the Grinch better than Jim Carrey. I don't know it really upset me that they even had the audacity to make a movie out of this classic tale. Sometimes it is better to leave things the way they are, we didn't need a live action version of the Grinch the original was just fine......"
1,Tragedy,"This movie is horrible! What were they thinking when they took a classic and turned it into a trash. I would not be surprised if Dr. Seuss would be rolling over in his grave from this movie. How could they take the integrity of the original story and add sexual references. It&#65533;s gross and makes my stomach turn. Children should not watch this version of the beloved story line of The Grinch who Stole Christmas. The costumes are the only good and creative element of the whole movie. Otherwise, this movie is horrible! Please spend your money on something that is worth while, like the original."
4,KEWL!,I think the grinch was a cool movie with lots of houmor. i reccomend this movie to others. (...)it's a good deal.
2,see the original,The original TV version with Boris Karloff is far superior. This version is extremely mean spirited. There were several scenes that were down right gross. The part about the grinch's unhappy childhood was completely contrived and unnecessary. The special effects were good especially Jim Carrey's make up. The songs were ok. I would rather buy the cartoon version.
3,DVD quality is horrible,"When I opened my case, the DVD disc was in an envelope wedged in on the back of the cover (where the booklets go) I found that to be odd because I have never seen that. I popped in the DVD and it started playing in the middle of the movie, odd again... And the picture quality is horrible!! No problems with the blu-ray and great picture! I wish I knew before I opened because it wasn't worth getting the combo pack, we can't watch the DVD format, the picture is too horrible to even see their faces."
5,Great way to get 3 Bond films,"Three Bond ultimate editions in one regular size DVD case -- very space efficient. And the ultimate editions are generally great, though the quality and amount of extras on the second disk vary dramatically from movie to movie. As to the films, well, Bond, Connery . . . enough said!"
3,Good read for the neophyte storage engineer,"This book provides an excellent insight into the technologies utilized within the realm of the storage world. However, there are more than just a few technically incorrect facts concerning cousin technologies when they are brought up by the author in attempts to help explain a few topics. So, 3/5 stars for the errors, but the book is overall very informative and spot-on when it comes to the subject matter at hand."
5,Una de las mejores novelas histÃ³ricas de todos los tiempos,"Â¿QuÃ© entendemos por novela histÃ³rica; las que cuentan una historia real en forma novelada (Yo, Claudio); o las que cuentan una historia no real pero desarrollada en una determinada Ã©poca histÃ³rica (El nombre de la Rosa)? Creo que las dos categorÃ­as pueden clasificar. Sin embargo, prefiero la primera clasificaciÃ³n y en ese sentido Yo, Claudio es una de las mejores novelas histÃ³ricas de todos los tiempos."
4,Great Book for technical Writing,"A must for all those aspiring Technical Writers.The layout is alphabetical, which makes finding items faster.Clear instructions with plenty of samples."
2,Overpriced plastic and terrible warranty,"There is no reason to purchase these dumbells when virtually every other product is of higher quality. These dumbells will shake the entire time you are using them. Bowflex has the best advertising team in fitness ,but too bad their product is faulty. I took these back in for sportblocks. Cheaper and better quality."
4,buy big go big,I think that if you can swing a heavier set you should. I mean 52 lbs is not that much for things like kick backs or squats. Why not pay a 50 - 100 spot now verse when you get seriousjimmy sprinkles
2,Decent,Decent but I caution anyone that you'll have to sift through some things. Way to many obviously supernatural acts are summed up as natural occurrences which presents a problem. It's a nice resource but I wouldn't call it authoritative. It left me scratching my head too many times to give it more than a 2.
4,What is up with the introduction music?,"What is up with the introduction music? This is the first season I bought on dvd because I love this show and I remember watching it while growing up. Don't ask as to why I bought season 8 as my first Married With Children dvd set but I was really turned off with that absolutely crappy theme music. What happened to Sinatra's song? That song fit perfectley into the introduction, when I heard this, I was repulsed, I said to myself ""What the hell is this?"". I mean its not a deal breaker because the show is hilarious probably one of the greatest sitcoms ever but what happened to the original theme and introduction? Is it like that on all the seasons? You have to understand, growing up while this show was running I associated that song with Married With Children, it literally defined the premise of the show and not hearing it in the introduction is a crime. if anyone knows, please let me know, I'm curious. Did it have something to do with copyright laws?"
1,Makes me sad......,"that the greatest punk band of all time released this borring 60's wanna be mess, after too of the most killer punk albums the world has ever seen they settle for this I just dont get any way get a copy of the Unboxed set which has their whole discography on it, leave this to the completests."
5,Little girls book of prayers,What an absolutely wonderful book! A children's prayer book for every need. I really enjoy how the author accurately verbalizes the everyday concerns of children. I especially like the theme of being able to pray to God about anything. I bought this book for my niece as a Christmas gift and she takes it everywhere with her. I would highly recommend this book to anyone with a young female relative. I even bought one for my own library.
5,Great praying book for little girl,"I bought this book for my daughter, who is 4 1/2 now. This is an amazing book and gains my daugter's attention immediately. The best part is all the prayers are related closely with almost everything would happen in little girls' daily world. It teaches them how to pray to heavenly Father, it also provides a great opportunity for parents to teach kids what is right what is wrong and how to deal with the difficulties they are facing. Wonderful book, well written, beautifully illustrated. The author did a beautiful job. Highly recommended."
1,Rather boring,"With this album Sam's career tumbled, which is understandable, because basically all songs are weak. You can get into the Full Force song ""Hurt me"", but already the lyrics aren't convincing. ""Another night"" or ""Spirit of America"" are rather boring songs stressing on hits like Madonna's ""Justify my love"" and American enthusiasm. Not convincing"
4,JUST ONE NIGHT WITH...SAM!,"WELL TOO MANY WORDS HAVE BEEN SPOKEN AND TO MANY THINGS HAVE BEEN SAID SO I WILL PUT IT IN ANOTHER SIMPLE WAY: ''JUST ONE NIGHT'' ALBUM BY SAMANTHA FOX WAS A GREAT ALBUM BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT DIDN'T TOP THE CHARTS BECAUSE FOR S O M E P A R T I C U L A R R E A S O N IT HAD NO PROMOTION FROM THE SINGER'S RECORD LABEL! ITS SOUND WAS EXTREMELY FRESH AND MATURE (SAMANTHA WORKED WITH THE HOTTEST GROUP AT THAT TIME, C&C MUSIC FACTORY, AMONG ALL THE OTHERS PRODUCERS) AND IT WAS SIMPLY MUCH BETTER THAN SOME OTHER R'N'B ALBUMS THAT WERE RELEASED AT THE SAME TIME BUT HAD A BETTER PROMOTION AND THUS A BETTER LUCK TO THE CHARTS...."
4,"Good Quality, Good Value, Great Service","This watchband was received promptly and it was exactly as advertised. I would buy from this vendor again and based on this one experience, I would recommend them to others."
3,The end,"This is RM's third and final cd. I don't hate it as much as most Rigor Mortis fans but like most fans I think the first cd is their best. This cd however has the RM sound, I think the worst thing about it is the production, to me its like the one/ones who were in the studio only worked with Bon Jovi and Madonna and didn't capture a metal kind of sound. Mike's guitar playing is superb, he is way better than average and can fly around the frets. The vocals work for the music, and the lyrics are interesting in many different senses. I can see why someone who never heard of RM wouldn't like this upon first listen. But to me they still retain alot of their trademark elements. It's unfortunate this album was their demise. RIP"
1,Almost Unwatchable,"For some reason they replaced Clancy Brown as the voice of Lex Luthor and that, coupled with the changes to his character, turned out to be a disaster. Instead of a cool collective billionaire genius Luthor, you have babbling idiot Luthor who grates with every word that he speaks. On the positive side Jimmy loses the mullet and some of the animation (particularly the sky) is improved from the TV series."
1,"Yes, it was awful.",I did see it on Cartoon Network. The plot was ridiculous. THe characters were like overgrown children. Lex Luther acted like a silly teddy bear and the others weren't much better at all. I couldn't stand Lex's child-like voice. The dialogue was silly at best. It was really bad.Don't waste your money on this trash.
1,How the mighty have fallen...,"It sucks. There, I said it. Nevermind the change in voice acting for the villains, or the inconsistencies with the beloved animated shows that inspired it, or that it doesn't seem to fit anywhere in the time line of Superman: The Animated Series and Justice League et al. Nevermind that it's essentially a promotional afterthought cobbled together to hype the new movie, or that this is likely the last time we'll see our beloved animated version of Superman.This thing sucks. Plot, dialogue, humor-it just plain sucks."
2,"A glorified episode, and not a good one at that.","Brainiac Attacks is all about the fight scenes. You'd expect this from a movie with Attacks in the title, but really, a lot of really ridiculous fighting. Brainiac arrives on Earth, fights Superman, Lex Luthor gets involved, and... That's pretty much it. There's one or two emotional moments where Lois is poisoned and Superman has to travel to the Phantom Zone to harvest a cure. But even this interesting subplot fails to meet its potential. Brainiac basically follows the ""Power Rangers"" formula where near the end he adds on pieces until he's just a massive tank-thing. Not quite the intelligent Brainiac I'm used to seeing. Oh yeah, and the thrilling dialog like Lex Luthor saying ""Super Duper Man"". Okay, setting my harsh feelings aside, it's probably worth seeing once and a fun (but disappointing) watch if you liked the Superman Animated Series."
1,Very disappointing.,"I really don't have much to add to the comments of previous posters. I agree with pretty much everything already stated in regards to complaints about the movie. I actually didn't believe it could be so bad, and kept watching assuming I was missing something, or they'd explain away why Luthor and Brainiac were acting so ridiculous (Luthor - ""I'm sad that my satellite is destroying Superman. No wait, I'm glad!"" Ugh!), but nothing ever came of it.However, I would like to add that my six-year-old son grew bored with the movie after about 15 minutes. Even in the middle of an battle with Brainiac, he just got up and walked away. So if you're looking for something for the younger kids, I'd advice you to keep looking."
2,Warmed up Left Overs,"Superman Brainiac Attacks seems like a left over three part Superman the animated series. The problem with this supposed made for video movie is it has that left over feel.Tim Daly again verbally dons the cape as Superman. The problem is his vocals seem tired and washed out. Lois, as voiced by Dana Delany, has very little to do, which is wrong.The plot involving Brainiac getting help from Luthor. Greedy and self absorbed Luthor wanting to be a hero like Superman. A Phantom Zone sub plot. And of course Brainiac wanting to take over Earth, while Superman is in the Phantom Zone...did you get all that? If you did, you are at the head of the learning curve...Now try to watch it in a cartoon version...NOT A GOOD THINGThe animation is standard TV animation, so it is not that special or worthy of a made for DVD presentation. However if you a fan of the animated Superman series, buy this to complete your collectionBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
4,A lovely gift for a daughter learning music appreciation,"This was a gift for my daughter. She had seen clips at school and became interested in it. She loves music and so this was a natural gift for her. The film is a little dated, but still enjoyable enough."
2,Peaches and Cream,"I felt like I was reading a critical review of ""The Prayer of Jabez."" I think that if he could have left out the5-10 negative references to a fellow brother in Christ (Bruce Wilkinson) that I could have maybe made it further than 1/3 the way through it. Maybe he didn't mean for it to sound the way it does, but if not he could and should have left all references to ""JABEZ"" out of it all. I for one didn't read Wilkinson's book and was looking for a good read and devotional in this. I didn't find it, though. Maybe I'll just have to read this closer without paying attention to the bad reviews to Bruce Wilkinson."
4,a beautifully realized short novel,"This is a beautifully realized account of a day in the life of a small town in eastern Poland in the early 1930s. Szewc has an eye like that of Proust. Details are lovingly recorded, all in an effort to preserve the day-to-day--a day-to-day that will be destroyed, one might add, during the Holocaust. The book is also beautifully translated."
4,Toxic County,"An album that really rocks, replete with whacky soundbite collages midst its country/gospel, three-course meal. The drug references are delivered with such aplomb I thought, at times, of the cool despatch of Velvet Underground. Though the irony is on deck, there's nothing here quite so cool, so detatched, as those old 60s guys. A friend had seen this mob at the Colony Room, in London last year(Francis Bacon's old hang-out) & recommended them; a great setting for this sort of music, I would think. Particularly taken with,'Woke Up This Morning', 'Ain't Goin' to Goa', and the rant of,'Mao Tse Tung Said'."
1,it would have been 4 stars if only...,"the american version (the one with the bonus cd) weren't butchered. i don't mean that vulgarity is edited; rather, there is a great section at the end of the original version of ""mao tse tung said"" that was removed for some reason. the original version of ""mao"" (on the british release) has an extra 2 minutes or so at the end of that track that involves a school teacher (or someone similar in function) educating a young girl about militant socialism. it's absolutely hilarious. unfortunately, on the american version, it's also absolutely not there. as far as i can see, there is no excuse whatsoever for such an edit, especially considering that the portion of ""mao"" that was taken out is one of the highlights of the original release."
4,Decent!!,"I had to replace my Space Saver B&D; on a sunday morning. I wanted another thermal carafe model but wasn't realy ready to shell out $80 for the Braun even witht the good reviews. I found this on clearance at Target for $35 and I bought a Cuisinart gold filter for it. I did not like the fact the Mr Coffee filter had a solid bottom to the gold filter. Anways, there is not much I can say bad about this machine.Things I like: looks,brew seletor,self clean feature,makes good coffee,the carafe is one the best I have used. The easy change water filter disks are a nice feature as well, inexpensive and work pretty well. I dont have any of the leak problems. Things I would change: could make coffee a little hotter but not a deal breaker,the unit beeps 5 times when finished brewing not a big deal when everyone is up and moving but I tend to set it to go on before the family is up. Overall for what I paid for this I'm very pleased."
2,Leaks and had to get another one,Had major problems with it leaking and ended up having to get another (different brand). I was shocked and a upset because of the mess it left in my kitchen.
1,Clumsy,"Pass on this one. The pot is heavy and awkward to handle - its also hard to clean. The main reason I purchased this was for the Thermal function - however, the coffee does not stay hot - only luke warm. Its ridiculously designed - I cant believe this passed marketing tests."
1,Two problems,Love the features but it didn't perform as needed.<br />1. about 1 of every 3 or 4 pots leaked onto the kitchen counter. We contacted the mfr and still have not been able to figure out why it leaks. <br />2. Must depress a button on the decanter to pour the coffee. It takes a great deal of thumb strength--my wife can't press it hard enough to get coffee to pour.<br />We are returning the unit to our Target store.
1,Don't let the looks fool you! It should rate 0 stars!,"Yes, it looks cool, but it's disfunctional junk!Lucky for me I don't have the leaking problem most people have.The problem I have is that it steams so much that you loose almost 50% of the water you pour in!I'll pour in all 10 cups of fresh water, and after the 900 watt element has over-steamed the water, I'll be lucky if I get 5 cups!Then, those 5 cups are too strong! I then have to add fresh water to the coffee!!Most of the steam comes out where the coffee exits, then goes up into that pretty green LCD display! The display turns black until it dries out. After so many brewings, the display is starting to form dark spots. I don't expect the display to last too much longer.Save yourself a headache and don't buy this thing!"
1,Swimming Pool 2,"I finally had to replace this coffee maker due to the mess it constantly made all over my counter. It appears to have a design flaw that was corrected in the newer model. Mr. Coffee will not even acknowledge this problem. I will never, ever buy a Mr. Coffee product again."
1,flood alert!,"This is the last Mr. Coffee we will ever buy, EVERY one we have ever had LEAKS coffee all over the counter, I kept giving it another chance thinking they could have fixed this problem by now, but no more, don't waste your money."
1,Couldn't even get started,Bought this on Xmas Eve to use on Xmas Day. Set it up but couldn't use it because it doesn't have a permanent filter included and doesn't take standard disposable coffee filters. If you buy this machine you either need to buy Mr. Coffee filters or a Mr. Coffee permanent filter (sold separately). Would have been nice had it said so on the box!!
5,They Major,"On this onje come on now stop it, this is one of the nastiest jazz-rap or hip hop cds I've ever heard, I mean have ya'll listened to this every song is gold, this record I spin just about everyday it's that nice, it's way nicer then 85% of the stuff that comes out these days."
5,The Soundtrack for life's defining moments,"It's hard to summarize the power of this album in a simple album review. These artists understand the power of communication and they use it effectively. The tracks on this CD are so deep and multi-layered that I still find myself discovering new words and sounds almost 15 years later.To put it in perspective, I purchased this CD 3 times and I'd buy it again if I had to.Purchase one: Cassette tape. I listened to it so many times it got warped.Purchase two: another cassette tape (I STILL didn't have a CD player yet)Purchase three: CDIf you love strong beats and music with a positive, yet real message you'll groove on this CD."
2,Sisters meets KMFDM,"I've not heard any previous Mortiis music. I'd read reviews saying this was more accessible industrial, and was looking forward to an experimental twist on black metal. This sounds like The Sisters Of Mercy meets KMFDM (though falling well short of either). Lots of female orchestral stuff. Pretty mediocre."
1,It's Horrible,"This is the worst Album of Mortiis, I don't believe that he has made something as that. Many elements of Techno music, and little Ambiental music."
1,Ridiculous,Don't waste your time! I couldn't get past 20 minutes of this stinker. It was insulting. Horrible acting and the first attack scene was laughable.
1,Just Bad,"First of all, I'll say I can think of no compelling reason for anyone to watch this movie.Plot? Man takes lovely, young new wife and skeptical children on a vacation to - Africa? The lovely wife and children find themselves trapped in a jeep surrounded by a hungry - and apparently murderous - pride of lions. Think Cujo on safari, only the dog was menacing and we actually believed Dee Stone and son were in peril. In Prey, stuck inside a jeep for days, no one even sweats or loses makeup. They do, however, truly annoy with innane conversation and predicatable mishaps. There are a few extras in this borefest who serve as delicacies for the wildlife, but virtually any nature show on Natural Geographic has more intense kill scenes than this tripe. I found myself pulling for the lions."
2,"Well, what do you expect?","Just take a quick look at the box art, and you'll know what you're getting into. Nothing special here, just lions that want to eat humans."
5,"Excellent Product, Great Results!!!!","I love Kerasilk's shampoo and conditioner. I'm an African American women and its hard for me to find good products for my hair that wont dry and damage. I recommend this product for everyone but especially for women with course hair. This treatment will leave your hair silky, shining and healthy. Buy Kersilk because it works, I promise!!!"
4,Solid read,"As a DC Metro resident, I enjoyed reading how the Metro became what it is today. Interesting to see how the city developed around the different stations."
1,"Olympus ""Water Resistence"" not as Advertised","I bought this camera specifically because of it's advertised ""Water Resistence"". Recently, my camera was splashed, wiped dry and put into an encloseded bag. Condensation formed on the inside of the camera causing it to malfunction. I sent it to olympus who would not honor the warranty and charged me $186.00 to repair my camera which they advertise as all weather and water resistent. Beyond that their customer service manager, Vince was rude and sarcastic over the phone and made several degrading remarks during my call with him. I am elevating this up the Olympus management chain but I think people should know that this camera does not perform as advertised."
3,mostly good,"i'm not a professional photographer and mostly use this for pictures of my family and friends during holidays or when i'm bored. It's very simple, stylish, compact, lightweight, and it has some easy to use features. on the other hand, and this may be my fault, almost all of my pictures are slightly out of focus. there have been about ten out of 300 pictures that have been perfectly clear, most of which are taken of my cat. Now for my purpose this doesnt affect me too much, so its' not a huge deal, but i guess you get what you pay for."
1,Dead after recharging...twice...beware,"I'm a photo amatuer, so I purchased the Olympus Stylus 300 based on its reported ease of use...and I have to say I was initially impressed by that and the quality of the pics. However, after about a month of use the camera would not power up after a recharge. It was completely dead, as I tested the unit with AC power. I exchanged for the exact same model, and the same dang thing happened with that one after about a month also. I returned the second one, and the technician at the store said that this was a common complaint...there appears to be a bug in the Stylus software...anyway, I exchanged it for the Canon Powershot S400 so goodbye Olympus"
2,Pricey & not the best camera!,"Nice design and good looking. (Although not yet stylish as Canon Elph's.) Good battery life but the extra battery costs a lot. You can't put in AA batteries in this one.Average image quality indoors. Good outdoors. Slow to focus and has annoying shutter lag. No manual features and many photos need to be tweaked in photoshop. Video mode is junk.Uses propreitary xD cards, just another way for Fuji/Oly to rip off consumers. What was wrong with standard SD or CF cards? Imagine the chaos if every manufacturer used different memory cards.Back to the camera, its a good attempt by Olympus but still way behind Canon, Sony, Pentax, Nikon and Minolta. This camera has nothing special warrant this high price tag."
2,BEWARE!,"This camera has a great concept of a weather proof, compact go anywhere body BUT... Beware that if you buy this, the software that comes with it to download your photos onto your computer will only let you edit and print those photos. In other words, you CANNOT e-mail or even save them to disk without purchasing the upgrade to the software from Olympus.Also, the camera takes okay photos, but I noticed that 1 out of every 5 or 6 photos is blurred for no apparent reason. I am not a professional photographer, but this is my third Olympus digital camera and it is the most expensive and poorest performer overall. That's not to say that it's a bad camera, but I would have expected better for the price.Having said that, it does have some useful settings, and I love the compactness and portability of this camera. I'm just very annoyed that they're expecting everyone to pay for the upgrade to the software to make the photos taken with this camera share-able digitally."
3,"Nice Camera, but limited functionality","The Olympus Stylus series of cameras are very unique in their functions; they are weather resistant. There are two models of the Stylus series; a 3.2 (Stylus 300) and a 4.0 (Stylus 400) mega pixel unit. Today we will examine the 3.2 mega pixel Stylus 300 unit which is very similar to the 4.0. This compact camera fits into any shirt pocket with ease, it weighs a bit more than most cameras (5.8oz. or 165g), which is probably due to the additional materials needed to weather-proof the camera. The 3.2 megapixel camera packs a punch, but has a hefty price tag. Is it worth its price tag, or is there a better alternative? Read on and find out what we think. (check out the full review @ bytesector.com)"
2,dead,Fabulous camera for all 5 months that it worked. Now it turns on but the shutter button does not work. Olympus wants $125. to look at it and probably replace it with a refurb.
4,worth it,"For a basic digital camera,the 300 delivers good results in general use. Do not expect it to produce what a $2000 Lica will. the camera was built for, point-and-shoot,and it delivers good color with generally great results. It is compact,small,well protected,and a treat to use. A great general camera."
2,"Poor Quality from Image, Again...","I love the movie, but this DVD is of decidedly substandard quality. I was hoping that the rough sound and picture quality of other Image Entertainment DVD releases like Destination Moon was a fluke, but prints this rough don't merit a DVD release. This one is also missing almost 30 seconds from a key scene."
1,1. Pay attention. 2. Pay attention. 3. Pay attention,"That's basically what this book amounts to. The only ""technique"" alluded to is a specific position (which is not all _that_ far out) but the key is to pay attention to your partner.If you do that, then any sexual experimentation you do will be fun, but don't waste your money because there are no ""great secrets"" in this book."
1,Beware: Reissue of 1907 Book,"Beware, this is not a recent book. This book was written in 1907. For some reason, the publisher decided to reissue it by basically photocopying the original book and binding them into a new paperback cover. Nowhere on this Amazon site will you learn that this book is a century old and obviously won't include material on more than half of Belgian history: World War I, World War II, the European Union, NATO, etc. The publisher apparently decided to save money by choosing not to reset the book's type, but rather to simply copy the pages. As a result, you get this antiquated, nearly illegible typeface with lots of blurs and marks that make it a headache for a modern reader.If you're looking for a reissue of an obsolete history of Belgian, this should appeal to you. If you want something useful to learn about modern Belgium, keep surfing Amazon, because this isn't the one."
4,the hottest r&b group of all time,"well i was about 9 years old when there first cd came out.so i have say that they are really great singers. i also rate there albums 5 stars because what other you know can put into having a crush on someone who wannna be with.till this day i still play there songs.my favorites are:quality time,and i can't wait another minute and so on.....and i hope they came out were we can have a crush on someone new."
4,Grab This If You Can Find It,"Full-bodied, emotional and dazzling performances by one of country's most underrated females. Spears' deep and drawling voice and dramatic delivery make songs like ""Blanket On The Ground,"" ""Stay Away From the Apple Tree"" and ""What I've Got In Mind"" rich and wonderful. This collection, made up of United Artists material, is missing one big Spears hit -- ""Mr. Walker, It's All Over"", which was a Capitol recording -- but is filled with terrific stuff. Get the Hux Records CD 2-fer of ""Mr. Walker It's All Over"" and ""Just Singin'"" to complement this disc, and your Spears collection is complete."
4,"Typically Great Sara, but...","Love Sara Ivanhoe, but a word to the newbie yogi...Sara's instructions for ""Tree"" pose are a little outdated. She instructs the practitioner to place the sole of the foot against the inside of the knee of the opposite leg. No no no no no no no. Never place direct pressure on the joint like that! The foot belongs either above or below the knee. And in the video, Sara is clearly placing foot against knee..."
1,The IDEA of this kind of album existing is far more amusing than actually LISTENING to it.,"Why do I get the feel in' that Lou Reed falls on his ass laughing' every time he gets a royalty check from this? Makes the Beatles ""Revolution #9"" seem danceable."
1,One Star Because negative 4 billion stars are not allowed,"I'd be willing to bet a bundle that the vast majority of the folks who are giving this thing 5 stars probably don't even own a copy, and the few who do never actually listen to it. After all, it is nothing but unlistenable noise, a review that The Trouser Press Record Guide refers to as ""a description, not a value judgment.""Whether Mr. reed meant this as a joke on the artsy-fartsy crowd, or simply as a way out of his contract isn't known, but it is quite safe to say that he did not mean it as any kind of artistic statement because it clearly isn't one. Unlike say, The Shaggs, who had an innocence and sincerity to their work, this is nothing but cynical manipulation, and that should not be rewarded."
3,Contempt.,"Let's not over think this one too much; this record is a statement of contempt, and it sounds like it. No one has a gap big enough in their record collection to fit this except the uber-completeist; on the other hand, I do think that everyone should listen to it at least once and to be sure, if you see a CHEAP old lp version of it, buy it. Personally, I sat in my radio station's engineering studio with a pair of good headphones and listened to both sides completely ONCE when I was 19. I did my duty to Lou Reed and the record, and my duty is done. I get it... Next!"
1,It's lou all right,"Visionary accomplishment! Masterpiece! Majestic symphony in four movements! Move over Mahler! Eat this Ligeti!OK, let's cut the crap. MMM is indeed nothing more than some type of static or 'white noise' if you will, slightly resembling what we usually call 'music', but it's got this peculiar, recognizable atmosphere. Lou Reed has always been a man made out of one piece, who's at the real source of the pop & rock-awareness and his fingerprints are even traceable in this selfindulging sadistic sonic storm. I'll be glad to add MMM to my (nonexistent) cd-collection..if i can get it for free. Cheers!"
1,People people people,"It was Lou's f-you to RCA records. Nothing more, nothing less. I read these reviews and feel like I do when at an art show and see works that a 2 year old baby could create, then listen to pretentious snobs debate the merit of it. We are talking about Lou Reed here, the creator of some of the most impassioned music of the rock era. He wouldn't do this to anyone except an enemy, which is exactly what this is. Don't try to read anything more into it, because it's pure fantasy. The jokes on everyone who doesn't get it!"
5,Grand,I was attracted to this book pretty late by the title. There was nothing small about this book. I think this is definitely the greatest magic-realism genre book and possibly the best novel to come out of south America. The book is a waterfall of heart-wrenching emotions. I felt evolved after reading it. Great book.
3,"cute, but difficult",really cute umbrellas. we anchored them in our drinks w/ a slice of lime. opening and securing the small rubber band to keep them open was labor intensive and because the umbrellas are so fragile we broke a few.
3,"Iberia Book, Michener","I had no problem getting the book at all, fast service, condition as promised. But I have been somewhat disappointed with Michener's style in this book. I have enjoyed several others he has written, i.e., Chesapeake, Trinity, Alaska, etc. Iberia reads more like a travelogue than an intimate history of a country and its people."
1,Not mineral crystal,"I got this watch at Wal-Mart as I needed a light, thin, digital watch for wearing on the job site. I thought it had a mineral crystal. I wore it for a year and it did well. Then I had to work under a trailer in the gravel and saw that the crystal had scratched. Upon further examination, the crystal is not mineral. However, the watch is light and relatively thin, though designed for a small wrist, which I have. I gave it a 1 star as I find most people will check out the low scores more than the high to see what the real problems are. I continue to look for and inexpensive 12mm or less digital watch. I have the MTG-900 which is an atomic clock, solar charging, LCD and love it except it is so bulky - 16mm in height."
2,good as long as strap holds up,Have had two. First the strap broke and it was as cheap to buy a new watch as the strap. The second one which was only 6 months old had the plastic break where the screw holds the strap. The watch was not abused. Don't even have a clue as to what caused the plastic to break since there was no traumatic event that would have caused it. I liked how light and thin the watch is but will not buy another . Will go buy a $5 watch somewhere. I had one that lasted me for years. Casio needs to improve its quality with regards to the strap and how it is held on.
3,okay entertainment,"A bit far-fetched, but no more so than Air Force One. Come on, AF1 getting hijacked. It was good entertainment.Check out the trailer for this movie, looked okay. I've always enjoyed David Keith in everything he's done. Hemingway is a decent actor. Bennet the other female lead in the trailers comes across stale. And Milbern a zero. I know it's just trailers and perhaps those two are better in other parts of the movie, but I haven't seen the movie - just a lot of trailers.The CGI of Air Force 2 is weak.It's a no brainer action movie. Like action, watch it, want something to stir the grey-matter, the trailer says 'pass this one by'."
4,Worth watching,"I like anything the Mariel Hemingway is in. Good, action movie. Would have liked a stronger relationship base. It was good enough to make me watch it twice."
3,Another good release,"I've been a fan of Eva Cassidy for a few yrs now. I'd have to agree w/ another review; not the best way to discover her, but if you're already familiar, a good, solid release. She can take even a song you've heard many, many times before & make it her own, such as Imagine, Danny Boy or You won't matter anymore."
1,Nope,"I never heard of Eva Cassidy before, and picked this CD up blind. Ms. Cassidy sings in a smokey, lounge-singer sort of way that works wonders with ""It Doesn't Matter Anymore"" (the first track). The second track is ""Fever"", which is a real lounge-classic, and she does it very well but I have heard that song at least 1,000,000 times. After that, the songs seem to alternate between sleepy/forgettable and some sort of country music gone lounge thing.Worse, some of the songs picked for this album just don't fit in with the lounge-singer style. John Lennon's classic ""Imagine"" is ***PAINFUL*** to listen to and seems to drag on for 4 hours rather than 4 minutes, and ""Danny Boy"" brings tears to your eyes as you wish that Danny was buried and long forgotten.I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this album is really not a good album. The first song is great, but the album crashes right after that. Skip this one, folks!"
4,Eva again-always Eva again,"Eva Cassidy has done it again. Just when we think we have gotton over our love of this lady, another cd reminds us that we have still an attraction for her. Like most I found her after she was gone, but like all her fans we cannot forget her. I hope that there are many more recordings in the future, surely it will end and we will have to be content with her work as a body. She still leads us on with great rendidions of new and the old music. We fans are sure that she will be known as EVA, nothing else is needed."
5,Just heard some tracks by chance,"Last night I was wandering round the record store and heard a beautiful version of Who Knows Where the Time Goes. I already have and love both Sandy Denny's and Judy Collins' versions of this song, but this one was neither. I went up to the counter to find out who it was, and the salesman enthusiastically informed me that it was from Eva Cassidy's latest album. Since I already have ""Songbird"" I knew who she was, but I was surprised to find that there are still so many good tracks of hers waiting to be released several years after her sad death. The next track, You've Changed, was equally beautiful. I haven't heard the rest of the album yet, but will certainly get it.I think the appeal of Eva Cassidy is simple and encouraging - in an age when most pop records sound as if they are computer-generated in a factory somewhere, she sang every song straight from the heart. I hope there is more in the vaults still to come."
4,"good for price, but not the best","I've purchased MANY towels on Amazon. I bought these because of the 'Egyptian cotton' factor. They're not bad, but I really can't tell much of a difference. The absolute best were still the 'Famous Maker' ones I bought a year ago. THOSE make me feel like I'm in a spa, they're thick, soft, and are without doubt, the best ones I've received from Amazon, in this price category! I only wish I'd bought more of those. Egyptian cotton or not, these are fine, but not like my 'Famous Maker' (Grand Patrician? something like that) ones..."
1,Terrible feel & see through at that,"While this is a great deal, the quality is poor, the feel is like sand paper and you can literally see though the material. Not worth the hassle or the $! A 1 star rating is over-rated."
5,Guitar Genius,"John McVey is a genuine Texas guitar genius and this is the best he's ever sounded! All the songs, nine of which McVey wrote, are great but my favorite is probably ""I Don't Stutter"" because it also features Fabulous Thunderbirds harmonica hero Kim Wilson as a guest. But every one is a prime piece of modern Texas blues and McVey's guitar work and singing are so strong he really doesn't need much outside help. The Austin all-stars backing him on the recording do a great job but his live act, showcasing bassist/vocalist Erin James, is even hotter. Catch him in a club or concert if you ever have the opportunity and you'll be blown away. In the meantime, ""Gone to Texas"" will more than satisfy your desire for real blues played with power and passion. It's just great stuff from first note to last!"
1,Not sterling silver,I'm a big Tommy Bahama fan. I ordered this to replace a stolen sterling silver TB1026 - the brown band version. This is not a sterling silver case or bezel as advertised but a stainless steel version. TB should have changed model numbers when they changed watch materials and sellers need to be more careful. And buyers beware. I returned the watch today.
1,Negtive and judgemental,Don't bother. A potentially good book that's ruined by (amongst other things) the assertion that people who don't follow it's advice are losers. I had hoped for more.
5,Blue Mallets,These came and are a quality product that work well. My child is in band and uses them daily. So far they are exceeded are expectations.
3,Nice product,"I purchased this because various web sites testimonials stated that it worked well on beards. It's OK however, at least for me, it does not live up to the hype on the various web sites. The wife has not noticed any difference on the softness of my beard. I will probably go back to what I was using previously which costs less that half of what this product costs."
2,Reliability Issues and Nonexistant Warranty Service,"Beware! Athena makes good speakers but the amps that come with their subwoofers are not entirely reliable. Mine recently lost over 90% power while still under warranty. Because Athena was acquired by Klipsch, they are supposedly moving their service centers. I am preparing to escalate the issue with Athena, as their contractors have so far left me without a working sub. With all of the shipping costs and the hassle, and not being able to use a sub, i regret purchasing the Athena. I recommend the Bic H-100 as a quality, inexpensive alternative that seems to have good product support. If I don't soon get my Athena fixed, i will be buying one myself. You can research more about Athena subs at avsforums.2 stars because if it works the sub is better than what you normally get for the price range (though the H-100 is much better)"
2,Practically a waste of time.,"""Spark Notes A Man For All Seasons"" was not condensed, but was merely the play reworded. Granted that it did help decipher hidden meanings behind some of the dialogue, or certain innuendo's which can go over one's head, but other than that, it was not helpful or insightful. I think it actually took me longer to read the Spark Notes, than the actual play itself. If you do get this book, of course you know to read ""Spark Notes A Man For All Seasons"" AFTER you have read ""A Man For All Seasons: A Play in Two Acts."" I do not recommend."
4,Wife and I both use it daily,"The Pros- upright so doesn't take up much space- is very quiet- shows heart rate, distance, speed...The Cons- I had to over tighten every bolt on the bike after using a couple of times because everything worked loose (especially the seat), but we have used regularly for a couple of months since and everything is still tight. The comfort of the seat is OK but need to give the butt a rest after 30 minutes of use.Overall we both agree that it was a great first exercise machine to start our home gym with. I would recommend it!"
4,"Great bike, apart from the seat","I wanted a quality bike, small enough to fit in the limited space I had. The Schwinn 112 fit the bill very well. It took me about an hour to assemble - the instructions were clear and all tools included. The bike works well and I am happy with it. The only problem is that the seat is a little uncomfortable but I think that is likely an issue with any bike."
5,The Receiver from Heaven,"I've had this receiver for about a month and the features are endless... Absolutely incredible sound even at low volume.... The detail is extremely crisp and the bass is profound. The DSP simulation on this receiver is amazing and with a digital connection from a dvd or cd player you feel like you are in the middle of the concert hall or in the middle of the action when watching movies. The 5 channel stereo is heavenly and will make your favorite artist that much better.. I sampled alot of receivers before buying this one, so take advantage of my thorough investigation and spend the extra couple of bucks on this mammoth receiver. (weighs in excess of 50 Pounds) I picked up this receiver through a dealer on an auction site and got a killer deal on it and am glad that I did so. leaves a little extra money for those digital cables and such. A must buy for any Home Theater Enthusiast."
5,A Bizarre blend of the real and the imagination,"This CD is the debut effort by the outfit founded by ex-Christian Death founder, the late Rozz Williams. This CD provided a glimpse into the new generation of death rock that was beginning to surface in both the US and the UK. The play list shifts between haunting ballads and rocking anthems at a pace designed to tear at your mind. The CD closes with a very rousing rendition of Bowie's ""Holy Holy"", which is still capable of bringing the listener where angels fear to tread."
5,Great Sound,"From the moment I heard Suicide is painless, from M.A.S.H. I knew they would be great. Suicide is Painless is my favorite song from the original by Jimmy Smith. They made it alive again."
5,OMG!! I cant't believe it's here!,"I was planning on buying a used vhs on ebay. Then they bring it onto DVD! This is a movie I remember since I was 4. Hopefully they will release Dot and Whale, along with the others in this series. A wonderful movie for children or those young at heart!"
1,Scary for little kids,"I was looking at childhood nostalgia on Amazon when I came across this DVD. I am glad the review includes a warning about the bunyip. I am not joking when I say this movie TERRIFIED me as a kid. I remember watching it once on tv, and I have honestly had nightmares for years. It's not supposed to be a scary movie! Why it scared me so much I can't say, but it did. It even baffled my parents. But the bunyip still pops up in my nightmares to this day (I'm 27!) Many people love it, but I just caution that young children should be with a parent when they first watch it."
5,A fantasitic book and there is another in the series,What a fantastic book. I did some research and found out that the sequal 'Eyes of God - A Novel of the Pinch' by Mark Kreighbaum has not only been written but is also reportedly an excellent read. BUT it is already out of print without any one appearing to know it was ever written.This is a sad loss. Does any one have an idea how I could get hold of a copy?
3,Just average.,"I'm a huge Beatle fan and I like George Harrison's songs but this was not his finest album. It's interesting but not a real grabber. If you are new to the quiet beatle, try first ""The Best of Dark Horse"" which contains the most commercial or known songs from this album. If you are a diehard fan: go for it."
3,then and now,"I originally bought GONE TROPPO as a kid on the day it came out back in 1982. It disappointed me at the time, but has grown on me over the years. I remember thinking ""Wake Up My Love"" sounded a bit forced (like George was trying TOO hard to come up with a single), and I still feel that way today, but it's a decent enough track. ""I Really Love You"" sounds forced, too, though in a different way. It's a cutesy novelty song, and just doesn't work. All the other tracks are enjoyable, though, particularly ""Mystical One,"" ""Dream Away,"" ""Greece,"" and ""Unknown Delight"" (George at his blissed-out best)..."
4,Nice garage/hard rock amalgam,"Live from Germany in the late '80's, this is a good record. The Miracle Workers combine a late '60's MC5/Stooges sound with an earlier '60's garage rock style. If you like the MC5, Sonics,, Chesterfield Kings, etc, you'll like this record.FYI - I was the bass guitar player in the Miracle Workers in our earlier days. I was not a member of the band when this record was recorded. No dog in the fight ;)Good garage record !"
1,Not Impressed At all,"First of all, I think some of the rituals and such in this book borders on some creepy stuff. I had heard alot of stuff about Frost tradition wicca, and I just thought that it was wrong, plain and simple.For example, when a young girl becomes of age and is ready to be initiated, she is ritually deflowered? UGH. All the talk about phalluses made me queasy.And the handfasting ceremonies in this deal with the bride and groom cutting themselves and then mixing their blood? Sounds just downright DANGEROUS to me.I don't practice fluffy bunny stuff by a LONG shot, but I want nothing to do with these wierd and creepy rituals. JMO"
3,A good way to kill a couple of hours,"I was a Deathlands fan for years, that is until Axler died and the series was taken over by a mostly inept series of ghost writers so it was with interest that I watched this movie when it first aired on Scifi. Better then the usual Scifi channel offering with some very impressive camera work and if the story isn't ""good"" in the traditional sense at least I was entertained. There are certain drawbacks the biggest for me was no Doc Tanner but the characters that survived the adaptation process were executed faithfully enough.Is the movie going to win any awards? Dear god no but those of you decrying this movie as a horrible adaptation and a fraud should remember that in spite of its many problems at least it got produced."
3,I pass the test,It helped me to be able to get information I did not have from my class that was on the test. I did pass the test and I am license to sell insurance.
1,False advertising,This stereo install dash kit did not fit in my 2007 Chevy pickup truck as advertised and did not include wiring.False advertising!
4,"ECONOMICAL, ATTRACTIVE AND STURDY","Chairs came already assembled - 4 in box. Ripped off the protective packaging and they were good to go. Sturdy, comfortable and attractive - a very good value."
5,Satisfied,The CD was delivered on time and in the condition promised. I am completely satisfied with my purchase.
1,Dont waste your money on Madacy products,"This 5 cd set is complete Junk. Basicly its random footage (that has nothing to do what they are talking about) with different narrators taking turns reading subtitles. They even use the same footage over and over as filler. This took no more than a week to make and it shows.All Madacy products I have ever seen have been of poor quality, and this title lives up to its history of low quality no talent production. NO entertainment Value here. You would have more fun watching paint dry.I must assume that the people who rated this set so high were somehow involved in its production. NO ONE could possibly enjoy this garbage. If I could I would sue Madacy to return the hours of my life I spent watching this garbage. STAY AWAY!"
1,Totally Disappointing,"I bought this CD based on the reviews and the way the CD was labeled (it sounded ""swingy""). I'm a swing dancer, but I also love most kinds of jazz. I hated this CD. It doesn't swing very much, the vocals are odd, and the arrangements are uninspiring."
3,Maybe Later,"After five nights of really trying so hard to get through this book...and I did try, I finally decided I was so lost it was time to quit and try some other book. I know I am not at the level I want to be in Elements, but just going through steps that make no sense with this book finally got to where it was not worth the effort. I'm putting this book on the shelf and finding one that doesn't assume I know the steps he leaves out. I'm very dissappointed because I really need to know this stuff :((("
1,The power is still hidden,"The value of this book is in the accompanying CD which contains the various programs (""tools"") that utilize the matters discussed in the text. I suspect the book might be of interst if you can access the tools. If you can't access the ""tools"", you aren't going to like the book. Despite some efforts by Mr. Lynch by emails, I was never able to access to the tools resulting in a book that makes a great doorstop and little else. It would be nice if you could get a refund if you have the same inability to access the tools. The book may be as interesting as the other reviewers suggest but not if you can't access to tools the author describes."
1,MISLEADING,"why would it say ""pack of 6"" if you're only going to send one???I don't get it!Your description is very misleading!"
1,No longer reliable,"I owned a watch identical to this for years until I lost it at the gym last spring. I replaced it in April because I love its features: big, clear numbers, indiglo dial, water resistant, date, metal band, easily taken on and off for swimming.I thought it was my fault that it got water in it and then died. I don't think any watch that is labelled water ""resistant"" should be expected to last through a full day in a huge wave pool. So I returned to Wal-Mart and bought another one.Now it, too, is dead. I even thought I put the old watch back on by accident after washing the dishes. I haven't done anything differently than I did with the original one that I owned. This watch simply is no longer water resistant. It will not last through normal handwashing and other daily activities. Disappointing. This used to be a well-designed, reliable watch for both everyday and dress-up wear."
5,Great Timex watch!!!,"I love this Timex. It's comfortable to wear, large enough to see. It has the date and the indiglo. What more could you ask for in an everyday watch!! :)"
2,Paper Feeder Poor; Ink Dries out too easily; Ink $$,"I purchased this printer in 2003, and its now 2005. Ive discovered a few things about this device:1. The paper feeder doesnt work well at all. You cannot have less than 10 sheets in the tray at all times or else it wont feed properly.2. The Ink is over-priced.3. The Color cartidge you can never get full use of because it dries out and you lose a color before you can even use 10% of the ink in it.4. I discovered that you can get a Lexmark Model 70 cartridge to work in the 470CX by prying out a little key in the reciver of the cartridge holder and tossing it in the trash. This will save you 50% in the price of cartridges. (If you can even find the 8R7881 anywhere, anyways)5. The printer drivers for this are horrible.6. The machine will scare the h*ll out of you if you receive a fax or something prints without you knowing it's coming. It makes a loud banging from the paper feeder w/o warning when it starts."
3,Upon Further Review...,"I have not had many problems with the printer functions lately, and the outgoing fax works adequately.However, I am taking away another star frommy previous review, because the fax function seems to mess up the phones in my house if I leave it plugged into the same phone line.It gives me line noise, and causes some of my phones to no longer ring when I get an incoming call. I have had to disconnect it from the phone line, which instantly solved all the problems. I put a phone using the same phone cord in the same outlet jack, and it caused no problem, so it is not a problem with the phone cord, it is a problem with this unit."
3,"A great education of NC industry, a so-so mystery.","#5 of the Deborah Knott mysteries. My opinion of this author has not changed after reading this one. I think Maron has a very unique style of writing. I love the education a reader gets on a specific industry of North Carolina. In this one it was the furniture/decorating business. She takes an actual real life industry and weaves a mystery in it. Not only is a reader getting a fun mystery, but they are learning something about North Carolina. This is great, especially if you live in the state. The problem I have with her writing is, I find it difficult to follow her characters. I think Maron could add a few more pages to her books to give a recap of Deborah Knott and her character, as well as, more memorable information on the characters particular to the story. I find myself having to go back to figure out who is who and what part do they play in the story line quite a few times. If she did this, the rating would go from a 3 to a 5 in no time."
3,"Love Deb'rh, just not this book","Dunno why but this installment of the the Judge Deborah Knott series left me cold. I did not find the High Point setting to be interesting, or terribly realistic. This is the only one of her usually VERY FINE books that drags. Deborah, stay in your home county!"
1,Cheap,"Theese pillows are cheap. I just bought them a few months ago, they where fine for about a month. Now, I am haveing to buy new pillows. Bad quilty for the money. I will never purchase them again."
3,"Fine for outside use. However, one major risk in using it indoors!","Use this in a garage, garden shed, etc. Perhaps the package notes that it shouldn't be used indoors (but I tried to enlarge the pic and couldn't get it to get bigger). Anyway, I've known people who have used it inside. If the mouse dies somewhere visible, no problem. But keep in mind that a mouse nest can be deep in a wall and the mouse can die in that wall. Then you have a MAJOR odor problem! We learned the hard way. Now we go with regular traps. By the way, even garages and sheds have hidden spaces where mice can die. Consider yourself forewarned.Again, possibly fine for outdoor use. Not for indoor use (in my opinion). But it DOES kill rodents.Bottom lineEffectiveness - 5 starsOdor issue - definite possibility.Final analysis? 3 stars"
4,Funn!!!!,"This game is so much fun! Its very challenging and great! The other girl who posted, why are you talking about Raven's weight and yours? (not that your possibly 60 pounds) That doesnt have to do with the game. But overall this game is great! An absolute buy!"
1,Completely useless.,I have a Mr. Coffee FTX41 coffee maker and this pot does nothing but spill coffe everywhere. Completely pointless. What FT series maker does this fit?
4,Updated review..,"I had to buy the replacement because the original cracked after 15-20 uses. The lid hinge is also cheap, and won't last long I don't think.Looks good though. :/Update: I changed my review from a 3 star to a 4 star. I've had the replacement for probably 2 years now with no problems. Use it every day."
3,Seems to be more fragile!!!!,This one seems to be more fragile than the original one that came with the coffee pot! I got one and I broke it within the first 2 days after the first use. I bought another one because I needed coffee in the mornings and I love the coffee machine. The second one has been OK a month into it....
2,Poorly designed,"Because of the way the plastic top is attached to the glass carafe, it creates a lip inside. To pour the last few cups you have to nearly up-end the decanter and when you do that steam comes up and stings your hand. Plus the lid is prone to falling off. It is amazing to me that a company whose business is to sell coffee machines can't come up with a better design. How did this not get identified in engineering/testing? Someone had to say ""this doesn't work too well, but let's go with it anyway"". Cuisinart has it figured out. Buy that brand if you can afford to."
2,Incredibly hard to understand--difficult for beginners,"As a student of Dr. Haskell's at Oakland University in Rochester Michigan, this text is as dry, un-inspiring, and mind-numbingly boring as the author is a lecturer.Why?1--text layout is poorly designed, requiring to flip several pages back and forth just to understand a figure. 2--poor design of figures and graphs. 3--obviously prepared, and/or edited by a committee of ""engineers"". 4--no color to rescue the senses."
1,Big Mistake,I would rather have the hair on my scrotum set on fire with a blow-torch than learn digital logic and 8086 structure from this book.
1,didn't like at all,"It is one thing to be stubborn, but it is quite another tobe just plain stupid. She got on my nerves so bad that I justhad to read to book in spells. The river is flooding and allshe can think about is her house. It was like she put herselfin harms way just because she wanted to. It was also sillyhow she kept depending on him to always rescue her. That, Ithought, made her seem helpless and needy. I just didn't likethis book at all."
3,Worth it for Ben Browder & Jennifer Love Hewitt,"I only bought this DVD because I'm a Ben Browder fan. The acting is very good, but most of the characters are very whiny (fault of the writers, obviously). Often times, you just want to slap them--especially Lacey Chabert's character, and I was so happy when Paula Devicq's character was written out. Again, I must stress that this is obviously the fault of the writers. The best character, by far, is Jennifer Love Hewitt's, as she's exceptionally sincere and sweet (but not in a sickening way). I don't plan on purchasing any other Season, and if this were on TV, I doubt I'd watch it. If you're a fan of the actors, then this would be a worthwhile purchase, but if you want something with exceptional writing, character development, and compelling stories, then I suggest looking to David E. Kelly's work (especially the sublime Picket Fences)"
3,Cant review at - as i cant install it,"Having real bad luck this year it would seem. First my H10, now this.Anyway, cant install it as i have an older ""Trial"" version of it installed, and i cant unstall the Trial version (for whatever reason).Anyway, no telephone number provided on box or website, and the technical support website only allows you to ask for help if you submit your license key (which i dont have, and i assume is somewhere on the disk as it didnt come in the paperwork).Getting fairly fed up with companies that do all their communications via email, 48 hours ago i asked for help and still all i have is silence."
5,Beyond Awesome!,"My 10 year old dd loves to learn how things work so it wasn't a big surprise that she loved this movie. However, her 13 yo sister is usually less enthusiatic. They watched the first half which is the part on sight yesterday. Both enjoyed it immensely. The older sister had video watching fatique (not sure of the exact time but the segments are lengthy) but the younger one wanted to continue watching as she was absolutely fascinated by the content of these videos. Anything this educational that holds both their attentions is a winner in this home schooling household!"
3,"Highon flash, low on content","I was hoping to be able to use these for high school anatomy classes, but it is too hard to dissect the meat from the fluff. There is a lot of good information in the video, but it is surrounded by these sensational stories that make good TV but are just filler when it comes to learning the material. I wish I could easily take out the anatomy/physiology information and lose the stories."
5,Great on TV,"I bought as collection to play it on my playstation 3, but now the console does not read any disc, second time this happens. I hope i can get a blue ray player."
5,You want real relief? Order this product!,"A little over three years ago I reveived radiation treatment for prostate cancer. As a side effect, due to the irritation caused by the radiation on my gut and rectum I developed both internal and external hemorrhoids. For the past three years these have been so bad that it takes two to three trips to the bathroom to empty myself enough and alieve the gas enough to safely leave the house.I have tried all the usual ontiments and creams with no real improvement. It was to the point that I figured that surgery was the only way out of this. Then I tried this product.I have only been using this for a week and the results are nothing short of amazing. The external one are gone and the internal ones are getting better.I do reccommend that you order some slip tip 1 ML disposable syringes (no needle) to deliver the product as it will reduce the amount wasted."
3,"Very cooling and refreshing, but...","This is definitely cooling and refreshing - there's no denying that. However, ""Calmoseptine"" feels about exactly the same and comes in a MUCH, MUCH larger container, so if you're needing to use this frequently, you might get a little more mileage out of Calmoseptine. It's kinda nice that Calmoseptine has an English label so you know what your putting on your booty too... :)"
2,doesn't work for me,It does initially have a cooling affect but then doesn't seem to do anything at all. I prefer over the counter cooling gels.I also use baby ointments and they seem to help more.
2,this is not the story of Hercules and Hades is misunderstood,"when I watched this movie, I was a little disappointed. First because this is not the true story of Hercules. He was NOT the son of Hera. In fact, in real mythology, Hera HATES Hercules. He was never turned into a mortal, nothing!Hades NEVER tried to take over Zeus' place on Olympus, really, Apollo and Poseidon have tried but failed. Just because someone is the lord of the dead, doesn't mean they're all bad..."
3,Little scary for toddlers but enjoyable,"Hades can be pretty scary for pre-school age children so I wouldn't recommend this movie for that age group. However, it is a cute movie that both boys and girls can enjoy. Keep it to the 5 and up though."
4,Hercules,I purchased Hercules (Gold Collection) DVD for mynephews girlfriend for a Christmas gift. The movieis fabulous and I got a bargin in the process.
2,Product did not meet expectations,"When I opened the package, it was covered in some kind of greasy substance. Had to take out the disc and rinse off the entire case, which now is ruined with water stains. In addition, the disc will not fast forward in my bluray player, I can only skip to the next scene but am unable to fast forward. When I try, the disc freezes. I would have absolutely returned this product had it not been only $10 with shipping. However, This product was not even worth that much."
5,Great movie with a great moral.,"Yes! Disney's at it again! Another classic film. The story of a boy who finds the courage and strenght in him to overcome any obstical. The Gods have spoken! Hercules is a great family film and a great film for any Greek Mythology lover (although some of the Greek Mythology was messed up, like the 3 fates being the 3 grey sisters, and the titans being natural disasters). Get Hercules if you love Disney movies!"
1,Did they even read the myth of Herakles first???,"(Hercules is Roman name...they use Greek names for everyone else. whoops. on of the MINOR mistakes) There's ONE, count it ONE thing right! good greif! Hercules had nothing to do with Pegasus, Hera was NOT Hercules' mother, and SHE was sending monsters after him. Paiun and Panic didn't exist, Phil didn't exist, The muses were too few and gospel music? sheesh gimme a break. Titans weren't eveil, Hades was NOT, repat NOT, Satan...I'm not even gonna go any further. This is horrible! if you even dabble in mythology burn this movie! (also-Hydra had 7 or 9 heads in myths (inconsitent, but not 3) Just stay away from this thing like it's the plague!"
3,Letterboxing makes picture too small,"This title does not give viewers a choice between standard and letterboxed formats. You are stuck with the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen. While it is nice to see the movie as originally intended, the picture is too small on my TV to enjoy.I have a 27"" TV and letterboxing can make it look like I'm watching a 13"" picture. I bought a fairly large TV to see a larger picture, not two big black bars.The extra money paid for DVD players and digital discs should afford viewers a choice."
4,Hercules,"Our 7 year old daughter loves this movie! It was #1 on her Christmas list as we lost our original. Danny DeVito is hilarious! It's a great little movie about doing your best and ""Going the Distance"". Great message, great music, subtle adult humor, too."
1,PATHETIC!,"WHAT A RIP-OFF OF GREEK MYTHOLOGY! HERA WAS NOT HERCULES MOTHER, SHE HATED HIM! I COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT HOW BAD THIS MOVIES MYTHOLOGY WAS, BUT I'LL SPARE YOU. THE ANAMATION WAS HORRIBLE! DISNEYS IDEA OF GREEK ART MADE ME SICK! SPARE ME! AS YOU CAN FIGURE OUT, THE MOVIES PLOT WAS PREDICTABLE! THANKS DISNEY, YOU'RE PROOF THAT AMERICA IS GETTING DUMBER! HELP! THE PART ABOUT HERCULES BEING STOLEN BY HADES WAS VERY INACCURATE!"
5,Loved it!,"Awesome take on Hercules! Loved this movie, especially the way that Disney snuck a lesson into the end. Catchy songs, great animation, FIVE STARS from this family!"
1,A waste of time and money-very superficial,"This is a highly superficial book! Never resolves why, he is in an enigma....could learn a bit more about righting deep and lucid proseconverting one's religion should be a matter of principal not out of convenience---so there is the story for u in a nutshell......someone who despises the Hindutva in the book but would have no problem with Naipaul's right wing bigotry.........A waste of ur time and money"
2,Lots of good characters...,"In fact, way too many of them. Lescroart is so busy marching people on and off stage that he forgets to get the plot going for way, way too long.The Dismas Hardy series does get better. But unless you're one of those compulsive people (like me) who has to read a series from the beginning, skip this one."
1,JVC DRMV5S is defective!,"I'll keep this brief: the JVC DRMV5S does NOT play the vast majority of DVDs. It is supposed to play NTSC Region 1 DVDs, but it doesn't. I put in a number of BRAND NEW Region 1 NTSC DVDs, and not only did it not play any of them, but it froze and nearly destroyed my special edition Criterion Collection Videodrome DVD.What's worse is that the folks over at JVC's evil headquarters are aware of this problem [just read some of the other reviews and you will see that it is rather commonplace], have no solution, and have made no effort whatsoever to recall this model.Buyer beware... the JVC DRMV5S is [...]."
1,I couldn't get it to work,"I installed it and its software and connected it to my ethernet router. The router couldn't find it and it couldn't find the router. Uninstalled everything and tried again - repeatedly, with the same results. This all happened on a weekend when the manufacturer's customer support lines were closed. Their web site offered no usable help.I decided to return the printer server and use XP printer sharing. Probably should have done that to begin with.I repacked the server and returned it to Amazon. Amazon promptly refunded the price I paid for it. This was the only positive aspect to the whole experience."
2,Decent in theory,"It's difficult to criticize a film whose intentions are so good. Theoretically, Happy Texas has all the elements that make up an entertaining, if forgettable, comedy. Unfortunately, few of those elements come together. The film feels deliberate, labored, and just not very funny. If anything, it's an interesting study in how filmmaking can go awry. The plot is theoretically sound - funny setup, decent nods to the counter culture, a little bit of action... And then there's William H. Macey, a proven powerhouse... A recipe for success, right? Wrong. At best, this film is a rental will fade from memory in days."
2,"One of those ""so-what"" movies","...""Happy, Texas"" turned out to be just the type of film that keeps you awake while you watch it but is forgotten soon afterwards.The reason I had wanted to see this film was William H. Macy, who was brilliant in ""Fargo,"" ""Magnolia,"" ""Boogie Nights,"" ""Twenty Bucks,"" and the like. Macy plays the closeted gay sheriff of the small town of Happy, TX, who goes by the name of Chappie. This was the only unexpected twist in the movie--when he ""came out"" to ""Steven,"" or one of the pretend-gay child beauty pageant organisers who come to town. The rest was sort of like ""Waiting for Guffman"" by Christopher Guest, but more slapstick-y, more predictable, and more...well, ""so-what.""Watch ""Happy, Texas"" on a lazy Sunday while nibbling on crackers or talking on the phone, for that way it will have fulfilled its purpose beautifully."
2,Where Is Trilogy?,"Most of what is here is ok but where is Trilogy? Can't beleive they would leave that off (it could be their best song) and include some of the really BAD tracks here like All I Want Is You, Brain Salad Surgery (could be THE absolute WORST song ever recorded and is totally unlistenable!!!!), Affairs Of The Heart, Pirates, Great Gates Of Kiev are all garbage! At least they have the full-length ""Fanfare For The Common Man"" which is criminally missing from the Essential ELP."
3,This is an ok book,This book has so many details it makes the book confusing. I don't really recommend it...
5,If you like adrenalin you must read this book!,"If you like mysteries, do I have the perfect book for you. ""The House on the Cliff"" is an outstanding mystery. I felt like I was in the story and making the decisions along with the characters. There are so many twists and turns in the story. ""The House on the Cliff"" is number 2 in the Hardy Boys series. A few of the main characters are Joe Hardy, Frank Hardy, and Fenton Hardy. Fenton Hardy is the main detective in his town. Joe and Frank are his kids who help him with most of hit cases. There are also a lot of friends who join in on the cases. The book talks about a smuggling case. The book got me so involved I couldn't put it down. The text in the book seemed very easy to read. I liked this book so much I might read another one from the series. So if you like mysteries the Hardy Boys is a must read. I really recommend this book."
5,this book is very exciting,this wonderful book was my favorate. have read almost all of the hardy boys and enjoyed this one particulary because it was about a group of gangsters smuggling drugs from a boat there is also this house on the cliff in wich the gangstars are hiding.the hardy boys and there chums are trying to figure out whats happining.they end up saving a gangster ang when there father fenton hardy does not come home they get suspicious. so the hardys end up getting caught but make it out of there with a action scene. im twelve years old and im apart of the world wide ring of hardy boy book collecters we meet in virginia every month.
5,Best non-gangsta rap hip hop CD of all time,"If you were a hip hop head around 1990-91 and you didn't have this joint in the CD player, then you were sleeping under a rock. This is, HANDS DOWN, the best and arguably most important hip hop record of that time. At the height of the Afrocentric movement, Q-Tip, Phife and Ali Shaheed Muhammad came with some mind-blowin', funky madness that had heads everywhere bumping AND thinking. Classic tracks like ""Butter"", ""Check the Rhyme"", ""Scenario"" were off the hinges. No matter who was flowing - and don't kid yourself, both Phife and Q-Tip had mad MC skillz - every track on this joint was hittin. Even when all my boyz in SoCal were bumpin' West Coast flava, I was on this like white on rice. Still recall countless hours rollin' the whip with this joint on hit. A certified hip hop classic and MUST HAVE for any serious hip hop fan."
5,5 stars isn't enough,"tribe called quest is the tinicle of rap. there beats so dense and layered there rhymes so smooth and there sonic texture nothing short of compelling. tribe called quest was rap with jazz/funk textures. i didn't think they could top the paths of rythem album but then out of know where came what is simply one of the most origenal, totally articulate albums i've ever heard. they sound like they have a million different influences but at the same time they don't sound like they are influenced by anything at all. its entirely different and more complex than just about anything i've ever heard. this kills me. every track. pure genius."
5,"Tribe's Best (not by far, all TRIBE is phat!)","Now, don't get me wrong. I don't want to down-play the other Tribe's albums, but this is their best. The slammin', jazzy beats and mind-melting lyrics stand out above the rest, but what else is there in music? You MUST HEAR Excursions, Verses From The Abstract, Vibes And Stuff, Check The Rhime, Everything is Fair, Jazz (We've Got), Scenario, OH what the heck, just check out the WHOLE album, grab a forty, and just sit back and chill..."
5,Even on a fuzzy tape I love you,"I found this old, scratched up tape in my brother's bathroom and it's been in the car ever since, my favorite song: ""what's Duke Ellington without that swing, what's a fat man without food in his gut etc. not a not a not a, not a damn thing."" These dudes are poets, I wish more hip hoppers would go back...You can tell I'm not a hip hop fanatic or a serious music hobbyist, but boy I love this stuff!"
5,ATCQ,"''It's like butter, it's like butter baby....'' - 'The Low end theory' and P.E's 'Fear of a Black Planet' are the best rap albums to date- you could argue 'The adventures of Slick Rick'/'Long live the Kane' or 'Paid in Full' are up there, but the former classics provide equal and unparalleled measures of style and substance that is rare to achieve in this genre; the ''golden-age'' of rap (1988- 1992) will never be repeated and I'm afraid to say that the music has lost it's way ever since gangsta rap made a mockery of it all- 'talking loud- saying nothin!!'"
4,Classic hip hop. Nothing else to be said,"Tribe has gone down as the group that backpackers jocked back in the early 90's. It's for good reason too; they make some very good hip hop music. They fuze jazz and rap together to make a unique package, and any self appreciating hip hop fan should be sure to check this out asap. It's not as good as their next album, but if you enjoy this cd then you must like the classic boom bap style, which is a good thing. Another no brainer for rap fans"
5,Klassic Album!,Classic Album had to have it! A must have for serious hip hop heads. One of the greatest albums of all time
5,One of the freshest Hip Hop cds EVA!!!,"I was so glad to see this cd in the Amazon bargain bin! It is such a phenomenal mix of R&B, Hip Hop, and kick ass rap! Phife and Q Tip lay down awesome jams over beats that Ali kicks! If you have never heard of this group or this cd and you dig rap and hip hop, you MUST check it out!! Peace"
3,Definitely Worthwhile,"A lot of jazzy samples and laid back beats, although there isn't always a lot going on in every song. There's good stuff here, and this album is definitely worth a listen, but some of it's only OK."
2,"Focus, Accomplish and Grow. The Business Owners Guide To Gro","This book is written in a simple,but effective format. This is a book that every business owners needs to read, digest and put into practice if they want to grow and survive the complicated business world that has evolved. Andy Birol has defined the road map to success with three simple words...Focus, Accomplish and Grow!"
5,A very practical guide,"John Kane is both an old-school typographer, but has also been a teacher for many years. It shows in this work. It is a simple book, sometimes with a single image on each page. But yet it manages to convey many difficult typographical principles quickly and effectively. The format could be read in an afternoon, but re-read many times. He makes it all seem easy and light.Highly recommended for beginners, or those wishing to brush up on the fundamentals."
4,"Good Book, get the paper copy instead","I bought the electronic version and I somewhat regret it. Go with the paper one, things will be much better for the eyes and you can turn to the pages you want easier. Sometimes when I zoomed on the ebook it becomes distorted/blurry so get the paper version.Lots of information on structure as well and what goes into the typefaces and such."
5,Very Pleased,I bought this game as a gift for my nine year old daughters birthday. She already had the KimPossible 2 game. Which she liked very much. She has spent a good deal of time playing this new game already. She likes it even more than 2 because you can play as either kim possible or ron!
5,The Greatest Guide for one of the Greatest Games,"No stone unturned!This guide covers everything about this game. Everything. Even all the Photography activities. It also has a mini guide for Ocarina/Master Quest! Mine even came with the sticker sheet in the back. Simply put, this is one of the best guides I have ever used for any game."
4,Even my sister had to admit that this was a valuable guide,My sister is adamant against using guides or cheats but one of the crazy parts about the wind waker game is that you have to find these small Triforce shards. If you didn't have the guide you would never find them all. In the end she thanked me for buying the guide. I must admit that even though the game looks some what childish the replay value and story line are pretty decent. It is very non threatening game with a lot of light hearted comedy. The world of the game is huge and there is a ton of stuff to do and see. In other words the guide is a must have because it takes you step by step through the game and points out tons of stuff you probably missed the first time through the game.
1,Froggy's Halloween,"I purchased this book for my two sons ages 2 and 4. I am incredibly disappointed in this book. Jonathan London should be ashamed of this title. If you as a parent think it is funny for the text to teach your child ""trick or treat, smell my feet, give me something good to eat; if you don't, I don't care, I'll pull down your underwear"" then buy it. Otherwise, boycott this book for all the right reasons!!! Truly distasteful and offensive literature."
2,"At the time.. decent, maybe.. but now..","At the time of the release of this album, it might have been a decent album. This was at a time where rap was just starting to evolve, and the ""old-school"" sound was the ticket to ride. When you look back on those albums now, you almost have to laugh at the lack of talent displayed on those albums. This album might have been good back in 1990, but now, in 2001, you almost have to laugh at the sound. This might be a good purchase for an EXTREME kid rock fan, but for anyone else, don't waste your money."
2,Not the greatest kid rock cd,"He sounds really YOUNG in this cd. It's like the beastie boys only the lyrics are a lot worse as far as sex stuff. This cd must've been made before he formed the band too, cos it's mostly just vocals and turn tables. This is not the Kid Rock we know."
3,The early years....,"This is definately as raw as it gets...at least I think it is.The lyrics all have that familiar Kid Rock signature. Mix with reality, sex, drugs...he puts it all out there.I do enjoy most of the songs, but miss the TBT!!For the fans, of course, as always...you need to buy it. This way you can see just how far he has come in the past decade."
2,Doesn't work for me,"While I applaud the focus of this book and don't deny that there is some really useful information in it, I found this book disappointing. Directed toward the re-enactor , patterns are too simple to match the directions. Basic patterns should come with basic instructions. I found this book to be too daunting for the beginner and too sketchy for the experienced sewer. It could also use more references to source material and documentation."
3,Oops and oops,"I did not realize how much I need a viewfinder in a camera. Outside shots almost always preclude seeing the screen in back. Oops, my fault for not figuring that out before buying. Then i dropped the camera and it bent the lens. $150-200 to fix. More that cost of camera--oops #2."
5,Great camera,"This is a wonderful camera. It's simple to use, has fabulous zoom and a fantastic price. I'm so pleased with it!"
4,Almost Perfect,"I bought this camera for my wife on her birthday. She's rather technophobic, and I really needed something that would deliver the advantages of a digitalwithout being too intimidating, and at the same time still offering more options that could be utilized, if desired. I am very pleased with the Panasonic. The picture quality is excellent and the 6x zoom is great to have. The only complaints are that the screen is hard to see on a bright day (I wish it had an eye viewpiece). Also, there can be a bit of redeye with flash pictures. But that's true of most flash cameras, I think. But all in all, a very good buy."
4,Great Compact Camera,"Took this gem to London/Paris this past april...it lasted two weeks on the battery which despite the bad rap on battery usage I found this to be great. I got wonderful photos and am very pleased with the camera. The controls are easy to work and this camera does do short videos also, which was an added benefit."
2,Battery consuming product,I am not satisfied by this product. The calrity is not good. Also this is the most battery consuming device I have ever seen.
3,a classic that doesnt wear the turns of time,i had a tough time with this book and put it down halfway thru -- possibly as a result of having seen and read TO SIR WITH LOVE and i enjoyed that story more than this one. This story just seems too outdated and non-relevant to me today.
5,Little Tykes table and Chairs,"The table and chairs have the same high quality of the product I bought 30 years ago for my child. The table was easy to put together and can be used indoors and outdoors. Would have liked it if it came with four chairs instead of two, though."
4,Mom of twins,"This table and chair set is adorable, and my 16 mos twins (boy/girl) really like sitting at the table like big kids. With time, they'll learn to sit for longer periods, but for now they sit for 5 minutes at a time and then want to start climbing on the chairs. for that reason, I wish the chairs were heavier (they're extremely light) so they couldnt turn them over as easily, but the fact that they're lightweight makes it very easy to move the set from room to room. Overall, a very nice set and any shortcomings are no fault of the set, I just think my tots need to develop better patience and attention skills!"
4,Good value but chairs tip easily.,"This is a great table and chair set. My son 2 year old son loves it and it was relatively cheap in comparison to ones like it but I have found that although they are sturdy, the chairs tip over fairly easily and he's fallen off a few times, but never been hurt because they're are quite low. Perhaps he just needs a bit more practice sitting on chairs."
4,It's okay for the price.,"Ok for the price but if you're kid is short, the chairs may be a little to high for their feet to touch the ground."
2,It might be an academy award winner...,"...But it dosen't deserve it! I must say I was quite dissapointed in Horner's so called ""excellent score"". For years, I have looked at Horner as one of my favorite composers. But along with Titanic, this score just isn't worth the price. If you have enjoyed other soundtracks such as ""Willow"" or ""The Rocketeer"", you won't like this score. But those who enjoy low, quiet, and somewhat erie music, this may appeal to you. However, I would not reccomend this soundtrack."
5,Some of the best...,"I received this soundtrack on CD as a gift, and what a great gift it turned out to be! This is some of the most peaceful, relaxing music. I think that this is perfect when you want ""escape from the world"" after a hard day's work or a great listen while relaxing at the beach. Bravo!"
5,A must have,This book is a must have for any henna artist. Regardless if your a first time novice or a lifer with yrs of experience.Catherine Cartwright-Jones has studied hard and put the time in to get such a large collection of fantastic designs together.Truly amazing book. Highly recommended.
2,Too up tempo,# 8 launched so fast I had to switch to another piece. Maybe it's just me but I found the tempo disturbing.
3,Too aggressive,"I know people will vote not helpful on my review, but this is how I feel.This is the frist 3rd and 8th I bought because classistoday gave it 10/10 recommendation. And indeed, everything is as wonderful as the other reviewers said so I am not going to repeat it. However Mr. Jarvi missed something that's most important in my view -- warmth. No.3 is ok, but for the 8th I'd rather go for Giulini's sleepy one. Mr. Jarvi sounds like a commander who's always pushing. It sounds aggressive to me and I think being aggresive is not the only way to show strengths."
2,The Fern Guide : Northeastern and Midland United States and,"This book is very technical and difficult to understand with out previous knowledge of ferns. The dichotomous key uses terms that are not found in the glossary and diagrams do not show all of the appropriate parts needed to use the key succesfully. The book is well written and drawings are very usefull, but without a easy to use key the book is difficult to use in the field to identify unknown plants."
4,bumping Club Music,"back in the day Mr.Lee was bringing he Chi-Town grooves. He has the Pied Piper,King of R&B/Da Kang of Music R.Kelly on some tracks on here,including the Stevie Wonder classic ""Hey Love"". Kells was bringing it back in the day. Mr.Lee had the grooves here. this Album still holds up real well. this has some tight House music jams from start to finish."
5,Video proof! My cats love this!,"Length:: 0:14 MinsThis video speaks for itself. My cats LOVE this toy. It's almost strange how much they play with it. They drag it around, chew on it, stalk it, roll around with it. Highly recommended!"
2,Cheap,My cat didn't really care for it. And its so cheap you could make something similar yourself.its just a piece of wire and some cardboard.
3,Okay,"Cat wasn't really interested in this, he loves to play as he is still a kitten. It is basically cardboard at the end of a wire. Not much substance. I wouldn't by again."
5,Interactive Cat Exerciser!,"I have a Maine Coon who just turned one year old, and I was having a hard time keeping up with his need to play hard multiple times per day. He will play on his own, but he prefers interactive games with toys such as feather wands, lasers, and mice to fetch. This cat dancer is just an amazing toy/exerciser for the both of us. He leaps all over the floor and furniture batting at it, and all I have to do is sit there and hold it up. Often I'll run around the floor, and he'll chase it, but he seems really content just batting at it and trying to catch the ends in his mouth. He just loves the erratic movement of it. Often he'll drag it into the bathtub and play by himself with it as well. I couldn't imagine a better toy for the both of us. Thanks to the genius who developed and marketed this. I ordered one for a friend's cat, my parents' cat, and my sister's cat. It's a huge hit, even among cats with less energy and a shorter attention span. Thanks Cat Dancer!"
1,Not safe enough for my kitties...,"My four cats love this, but I am not comfortable letting them play with this product. Smacks in the face and inevitable chomps on the wire just make me uneasy. I prefer using Da Bird, which they love even more than the Cat Dancer, but without the hard springing action that is not in control. A scan of some of the reviews here confirmed that I was not alone in eschewing the Cat Dancer."
1,Cardboard on the end of some wire,Wow....this thing sucks. My cats were not interested at all. Cat Dancer makes another toy with some colorful cloth at the end. They preferred that one by far.
1,"Fell apart, useless now","This product is a couple pieces of cardboard attached to a wire.When I had read other's reviews of this, I thought to myself, ""So what? I've made tons of cat toys over the years out of string, yarn, crumpled up paper, etc."" If the maker of this toy had a creative idea in cat toy design, it was worth $3.01 to me to find out what that design was.The cat barely noticed the toy, and when he did pay attention, it fell apart quickly.In addition, it is difficult to control to play effectively with the cat."
5,What a simple concept,"A wire and paper rolled up tight. A happy cat on her back swatting away at the paper, over and over. That in essence is what you are getting.Princess really like this. It has a mind of its own. She swats at it, and it keeps bouncing back. She swats at it again, and the bouncing repeats. Sometimes she jumps at it and bite it, and when she let it go, it continue to bounce. More swatting. It's really entertaining for her, and I enjoy watching her do tumbles and rolls. Absolutely recommended toy!"
3,Excellant,My cAT really loves this cat dancer. I lost the first one we had and have never been able to find one since. thankyou.
4,Favorite for Both Cats,"I have 2 cats at home, male and female, and each one of them loves this toy for different reasons. He will only play with it if you're holding one end of it and he gets to chase it around and bat at it. She, on the other hand, loves it on the floor and loose. She'll try and sit on one side and roll around and spin with it like she's chasing her tail. It's hilarious.My only complaint is that the first cat dancer we purchased had a sticky paw attached to it that was supposed to hold it to the wall. It never worked and now we've got this paw stuck to the wall and it's not exactly attractive.But the toy itself is worth it!"
2,Picture did not match item,"The photo indicates this toy has 5 twist cardboard pieces at the end of it, but mine only had one piece. Not much of a toy. I would return it but that's too much of a bother for a $3 item. Too bad because I was thinking of buying a bunch of them for a local shelter, but won't now at least not through Amazon. I've seen them in stores with the 5 pieces (albeit for higher price) so will have to get them there."
3,It's ok,I think this product would probably be ok. I had such high hopes for it because of such good reviews. I was excited to have it come in. My cat will not yet play with it. I've had it a few weeks and she acts like it's an alien or something. But maybe if it hadn't flopped out of the package and bopped her on the head she might have liked it.I'm going to try again later because it is a cute product and I hoping she forgets about being bopped on the head with it.
1,My cat would not even look at this toy.,"Your mileage may differ, but my cat was completely uninterested in the Cat Dancer. She literally would not even look at it.I think this would be best for very young kittens who will bat at anything that moves."
1,Not that great,"I thought this toy was a little odd - a wire with rolled cardboard on the end. its seemed springy enough to get my cats attention. But they didn't think much of it. Didn't entice them one bit. Then when i inspected it, i noticed that the wire was looped around the last cardboard 'stick' - the edge of the wire was somewhat sharp. guess it is safe enough but its just not worth it - and they didn't like it anyway... so that was that. shipping was fast."
1,Cat Dancer 101 Cat Toy,"My cat wasn't interested at all in playing with this toy, so I have to give it a thumbs down."
2,DANGEROUS,"My cat loved this toy, it got tangled with another toy and was stuck around her leg, I had to hurt her to get it off, I would never leave laying around if not home she would have probably lost keg or worse !!!!!!!! I threw away"
3,Cheaply made,My cat destroyed this in less than a week. It's made of thin cardboard. Fun while it lasted though. Meh
5,Cat dancer,This is so basict I feel like a fool for paying for it. My cats LOVE chasing this thing!...Basically some cardboard on a hanger lol. Anyways- they love it and it was worth a few bucks
3,Fun but be careful!,"This was a great toy for my 8 year old indoor cat. He lives being active and playing. But this wire like toy, with cardboard/brown bag rolled up end can be a little scary! He got overly playful and the toy sprung back and when it came back around, hit him in the face! Luckily it didn't hit him in the eye. Best to just hold this in front of cat to let him paw, not swinging it around!"
3,Cat Love It But Too Dangerous,"I have two cats, both adults who have, and loved this toy. It is so simplistic but both go nuts over it. I had mine about a year, and the metal hook others mentioned become exposed (that the cardboard attaches too) and eventually gets pulled off by the cats in play. I thus decided to throw it out. No hooked cats, but not worth the risk, but I guess if you are diligent about checking daily but to me not be worth the risk much to my cats disappointment."
4,It makes kitty happy,"Now this may not be the most money friendly toy (come on, it's wire with little rolls of cardboard, the packaging probably costs more than the toy), but our cat really seems to enjoy it. We received this as a gift from a family member, and she absolutely loves it. Her face lights up whenever she sees it, and she gets SO in to chasing it and playing with it. Human-wise, the wire is long enough to prevent losing a finger or two. We tend to use the extra cardboard rolls as a bit of a grip, so that way she only has to concentrate on catching one. All in all, I'd say this is totally worth it, especially if you're looking for something to get the $25 minimum. (Or a few extra kitty stocking suffers!)"
4,Inexpensive and my cat loves it!,"Very simple cat toy, but worth the couple of bucks that I paid for it because my cat really does go crazy for it."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this camera partially based on the reviews I read. While it takes good pictures and is easy to use, the software isn't worth a hoot! I am still unable to transfer photos from the camerausing Olympus Master software to my computer....the message comes up that there is no camera connected. However, i can transfer the photos using Windows with the same connection. I've read and reread the manual, connected and disconneted the camera a number of times and it still doesn't work. My other complaint is that the battery runs out really fast. It always needs recharging even though i don't use it that much. If it weren't so cumbersome to package it all back up, i'd send it back and get a refund."
4,cannot complain,"beautiful camera, takes great pictures, and the price is not bad. its small enough to slip into a pocket and the LCD display is huge compared to the overall camera size."
2,"Grainy, noisy images make this cam dissapointing!","Aesthetically and ergonomically, this is one sleek, gorgeous design. BUT to make a long story short, MANY of the photos taken with this cam are in fact 'grainy' and 'noisy', and unquestionably lacking sharpness and detail (especially indoor flash shots) for what is supposed to be a 7.1 megapixel image. My wife and I actually compared the 'Olympus 710' pics with our 5 year old 'FujiFilm 2650' 2 megapixel camera's pics, and SHOCKINGLY the old 2 megapixel cam won hands down! Go figure. Even our much less expensive 'Nikon Coolpix L14' that we just bought to replace this camera, has far superior quality images. The interesting thing is that I read several posts and/or threads here on 'Amazon' and on the net that allude to the blurry pics that the 710 often displays. Perhaps there was a quality control issue on some of these cams? If anyone else has experienced dissapointing quality images with this cam, please comment below and share your story. Thanks."
3,Extra priority shipping costs do not get you faster shipping!,"I paid $6.99 extra for priority shipping. Therefore, this should have been two-day shipping once the product was actually sent out. However, after the product was shipped, it still took 6 days to ship. Therefore, I could have paid for regular shipping and gotten it at the same time. Why did I pay $6.99??? After all, I am a broke college kid just trying to make ends meet!"
4,A Good Listen...,"its probably more like a 3.7 in star rating...but theres no option for that...so i just rounded up to a 4...but anyways, this album is pretty bad ass...some tracks are better than others...as is the case with most albums...the singer sounds kinda like joey ramone... singing to straight up rock and roll with reverb and distortion on his voice...it sounds good... but if i was to compare, i'd have to say this album is reminiscent of g'n'r's appetite for destruction mixed with some old 70's punk like the dead boys or the saints...all in all, this album does have some good rock and roll tunes...i got it off emusic.com for a small fee...i hope i can say that on here...why should they care?...the album's out of print anyways..."
3,"look, folks","these guys are ok--the melodies pass muster and the singing is (say this in a johnny lydon-like sneer) competent. it's just that there are many many more deserving bands out there who have sold one/twelfth of what the shins have done. i urge you to look into the following much much more melodic and inventive and literate alt-pop acts: Idaho, the black watch, the church, the caseworker, the sugarplastic, the clean, the chills, and straightjacket fits..."
4,Here Come The Shins,"This band is a great newcomer in the world of indie bands. They have a unique sound and even though the band name begins with ""The,"" as does seemingly every new band that has put out debut albums within the past year or so, they have an unusual sound. This album is definitely one of the ten best of 2001 and I am looking forward to where they will go on their next album.The album is full of excellent melodies, off-the-wall lyrics (similar to those of Sparklehorse), and psychodelic background sounds. My only complaint is that sometimes the voice is too quiet and there is too much echo (esp track 1) ...it's hard to understand some of the lyrics...but the lead singer has a great and unique sounding voice. It is a mold of Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse, Simon and Garfunkle, and Casablancas of The Strokes. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone waiting on the next Radiohead album although I am making no comparisons."
5,The Shins - music spreading quickly,"First of all, the music on this cd is original and no song is alike. This is one of the few cd's in my collection that I can listen to day after day after day. I commend the band for thinking up such original songs. I would also like to urge all listeners of The Shins to buy their cd and not burn it. The band is just starting out and they need the money to make new songs. This cd is A+ material. Go out and buy it. No questions asked. ( I agree with the review above me, Sphagnum Esplanade should have been in the album.)"
3,"B Version of ""The Hours""","A well written book with an ultimately uplifting message, I found myself pushing through to get through some sections that seemed ponderous. Similar in style to Michael Cunningham's ""The Hours"", the book is broken into three stories that interweve along a family bloodline. Each story melds between the present and the past, with the last story bookending the first in a clever way. My problem with the book is I found the first and last sections far too short and the middle section too long. It also reminded me of ""The Hours"" for it's themes of life and death, I just felt ""The Hours"" did it much more sucessfully."
2,Three Junes,"I read about 2/3s of this book and gave up. It's extremely boring and pointless. Nothing happens in this entire book. No murders. No action. No nothin'!It's called Three Junes not because it's about three people named June, but because the book is split up into 3 parts that all take place in June of different years.The first part is about Paul McLeod. The entire story is about him on a cruise. That's it. Nothing happens on the cruise.The second part is about Paul's son Fenno. This was probably the best of the 3 stories. Fenno is gay and owns a book store in Manhattan. His neighbor, Mal, asks him to take his bird Felicity for him. He wants her to have a home after he is gone. You see Mal is dying of AIDS.Fenno also meets Tony. A gay photographer who's house sitting in Manhattan. They have wild sex every day for a while and then Tony disappears.And I didn't finish the 3rd part. I tried, but I just couldn't make it.Please, don't read this book. It's a total waste of your time."
5,Tale of Complicated Characters,"This novel weaves a tale of very complicated characters. It was difficult to feel sympathy for Maureen's illness once shown her brutal cruelty in a scene involving puppies she labeled 'Mongols'. Yet she's perfectly adapted to accepting the fact that one of her sons is gay and her conventional husband, Paul, struggles with his stew of turmoiled emotions concerning Fenno's homosexual lifestyle. At times, the father seems spineless and distant while the mother appears callous and obsessive over her collies. But the reader is quickly shown that the characters of this novel are much 'deeper' than these surface observations.Though at times it is difficult to read on as several of the characters battle with reality of death, often at a young age, one will come away from this book with a richer sense of understanding how family relationships influence our entire lives.Chrissy K. McVayauthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'"
2,More than I wanted to know!,I enjoyed the first part of the book but I was not prepared for the gay sex in the second part. It's not that I'm against gay sex for gay people but I'm just not willing to read about it. A more honest back page would give a warning to buyers so those that want this could buy it and those that don't could choose something else. I threw it in my recycle bin as I was not willing to pass it on to friends or family.
2,Boring,"The first part of the book held my interest and I cared about the character. The second section, ""Upright"" is just plain too long and boring. I really don't want to hear every detail about Fenno, a very uninteresting character. I'm about ready to quit the book. Can't imagine how it became a best seller."
1,TERRIBLE,"This is the worst book I have read in a long time. It is boring, disjointed, and goes nowhere. Part 1 started off okay. Part 2 went downhill and I thought it would never end. Part 3 -I expected that section to develop the lives of Fenno's brothers and their families. WHY FERN? WHO IS FERN? Who cares?I could hardly wait to get to the end and throw the book out. I won't even give it away to a friend. How in the world could this book ever have received rave reviews and awards?????"
4,Good for the first 2/3,"This was a well-written, interesting book. I really enjoyed the parts from the first two points of view. I thought the author went didn't create a very interesting narrator for the third part of the book, though, the only part told from a female perspective.I enjoy looking into Scottish lives, although as an American, I can't really judge how accurate the authors representation of the Scottish characters is.I thought the characters faced interesting problems, and that the book did a good job of showing how little we know of each other, even when we live in the same family!"
3,Three Junes,"A slow start , but, picks up speed 1/3 of the way into the book.The ending was a let down."
3,Fast Start--Slow Finish!,"The first section of this book, ""Collies,"" is superb. It depicts Paul McCleod dealing with the death of his longtime wife, Maureen, their relationship on a Scottish breeding farm and Paul and Maureen's three sons--Fenno, and twins Dennis and David. If the quality of that writing had continued, ""Three Junes,"" would have been a great book. Sadly, this is not the case. The middle section, ""Upright,"" dealing with eldest son, Fenno McCleod is too long, and ultimately uninteresting. The last section, ""Boys,"" is better, but unsatisfying because the middle section has failed to fulfill the promise of the first.Julia Glass shows great promise as a writer. Hopefully, she will continue to improve her craft and offer us more selections in the future."
1,Publishing info incorrect,I just received my copy of this book thinking it contained current ideas of Amartya Sen only to discover it was published in 1992. Maybe they are still relevant. The one star is for the incorrect publishing info.
5,Hikki more than Hype,"Ok I know that most people have never heard of Utada Hikaru unless you are into Jpop or been to Asia so heres a small background. She has officially released 3 albums to date(4/8/01) 2 in Japanese and 1 in English this is not counting her coordination albums (U3, etc..). This album simply blew me away when I first heard it. The lyrics, beat, and mixing flowed together flawlessy on nearly every track(this is probably because she wrote and composed all of her tracks). First Love is clearly the standout on this album and really tugs at you whenever you listen to it. If the price is intimidating than you can look for the OS(Overseas) version to purchase which usually costs about half+ of the japanese version. This is a GREAT album for ALL music fans of any nationality that love pop/R&B."
3,Hikaru?,"Although I am a fan of some of Hikaru's songs, I'm in awe of how she's become so popular with her attitude. From what I've read about her, she's a snob and she has let stardom go to her head. I don't know if I should support an artist like that. ^_^; I think for now, I will stick with Mai. >/ Lately, Hikaru hasn't really released anything that I've liked. (Final Distance was okay, but it sounded like she was trying too hard."
1,Beautiful Voice,I have been listening to this CD like crazy lately. I'm not sure why but her music is very catchy and the lyrics are good. The song First Love is pretty sad. If you could understand what she is saying in Japanese you would understand why I say that. The cd is a must have for anyone. Her voice is just so soothing and Japanese is a very beautiful language for music.
5,happy customer,very happyrecieved in 3 days after orderedwill buy again when neededit was so easy a monkey could do it
4,Excellent follow up album!,"I still think that this Hi-Five album was the best of the three. They sounded more mature here as they had to step up their sound a bit. I still like the funky She's Playing Hard To Get. But the rest of the album has some surprises. The four R. Kelly produced songs are solid and I still love Quality Time. Hmmmm....doesn't that song sound like R. Kelly's Sex Me?--identical sounds. But songs like A Little Bit Older Now, Mary Mary and the funky Video Girl demonstrate their newer image. I still love Fly Away and how the ballad sounds. I still play it sometimes. This was a well done followup and Tony Thompson can sure be SAANGING it at the end of Quality Time and the rest of the album as the lead singer."
3,Befuddling,Helpful... but I doubt some of its accuracy .... it clashes with some of the firsthand account I have delved in.
4,Physics of James Bond,"This book discusses physics as applied to the world of James Bond 007, but is done for more of entertainment value. It should not be taken to be a serious book, but rather for pleasure. The physics is rather basic/simple in nature, lacking any real depth of content, but does address some physical concepts that 007 may be up against."
2,Cookie cutter metal,"I really wish I could rate higher but there is no imagination with this cd...it is everything one can hate about the 80's.I think a 13 yr old could write better lyrics. Don't waste your money, not even for nostalgia sake,and lets hope she fares better at jazz as she has a great voice."
1,"If it wasn't the required text book, I'd return it.",I found it to be very hard to follow. This is not the place for trick questions.
5,the biz always is on point,what can you say about this gem? it has everything for a party and more.while some folks only wanna trip this set shows a cat who knows what he is doing.just a friend was pre-cursor to everything you see on jerry and the other tabloid shows.nobody beats the biz bumps in your ears.this one can rock year in and year out.
1,it sucks big time,it is such a cheap product.....don't waste your money.....mine is even defective........
1,just for laughs dvd,"The two dvd's I bought were not compatable with my UK dvd player.We were all looking forward to seeing the fantastic shows, but so let down that we didnt know the dvd's would not work."
5,Love this CD,I love evey song on this CD I even brought one for my father in law. I saw him concert in june and just wanted to hear more of his music.
3,Honky Tonk yes but...,"I picked this CD up mainly because I've always liked Dwights very unique and unmistakably twangy voice and style.I have to admit that I've never heard much of his music and can't say I'm a fan and maybe that's why I didn't really take to this CD as well as I thought I would.You see, I'm not big on Honky Tonk, and this CD is nothing if not that.I would have liked this compilation well enough had they included a few more of Dwights ballads but as it is, the CD is awfully heavy on HT and not much else.I gave this CD 3 stars because of Dwights voice and for the few ballads on here. ""I sang Dixie"" being perhaps one of the most poignant Country ballads ever written and deserves a 5 star rating in and by itself, and the other few ballads are outstanding as well.I can definitively see why this CD has gotten so many great reveiws because if you love HT you will love this CD, it's just not my style."
5,LOVE this book!,"I fell in love with this book because it compiles thoughts from children in their own handwriting about their MOM. It brings back memories of being a child and having a MOM... and demonstrates everyone's unique experience with thier OWN MOM. It's inspirational and causes one to reflect what your own children might write about you, whether it be a little disgruntled or fabulously flattering! It's truthful and wonderful... and I actually needed a kleenex while I read it because it touched me deeply."
5,A triumph--Perhaps an instant classic,"Moore has worked a wonder--this is a captivating read designed for the layman but also filled with surprises for geologists, historians and naturalists. It is an indispensable, complete guide combining a history of adventures in Sierran exploration with tutorials on geology and natural history. We are led by the hand along carefully marked maps and trail guides to vantage points from which geologic features can by easily examined in the field; that allows a reconstruction of the forces and events that produced the majestic landscape. Clearly, simply, and arrestingly written, and frequently puncuated by anecdotes of Indian tribes, early settlers, pioneers and scientists, the book is studded with photographs, diagrams,and maps--I could hardly put it down. It will become the premier guide to the high Sierra."
2,Slow-moving and contrived,"While it's not the worst miniseries ever made, 5 Days is quit pretentious in its slow-moving shots that apparently are made to have us see this as some kind of ""oeuvre"" by the director. It's not. As a psychological portrayal, it's not up to snuff, and it takes so long for anything to happen that you will wonder why you're bothering to watch it all. The final episode came close to being interesting, but it was a long haul to get there."
2,A Miss From HBO,"Five Days is a 5 episode mini-series detailing five separate days of an eleven plus week murder investigation. Consequently, the viewer is moved along at a very rapid pace and left to draw their own conclusions to a number of events and fill in gaps between episodes. Given that audiences are usually much smarter than given credit for, this is not a bad thing if done creatively. Not so here. This approach quickly loses focus and sustaining mood and ultimately leaves us feeling uninvolved and without sympathy or empathy for any of the victims. They all come across as self-involved whiners - clearly not the intention and clearly not a reaction the viewer wants to have. (In the extras, the writer defends her inability to weave a cohesive story by saying that choosing five days throughout the investigation and putting the burden on the viewer to play catch-up is more challenging for her. Of course it isn't, it's merely lazy.)"
4,Insightful!,"If ever there was a book that sounded like it was written by a bunch of consultants it's this one. And - surprise - a look at the cover reveals that the author is none other than Dannemiller Tyson Associates, with about 15 people connected with the firm credited as contributors. With origins like these, it's no wonder that the book is chock full of phrases like, ""If you facilitate a paradigm shift among enough microcosms, the entire organization will share the experience."" But don't let the lame language scare you off. If you want to learn change management strategies, sooner or later you're going to have to pick up consultant-ese. Once you do, you'll be intrigued by the concepts set down in this book about whole-scale change and the use of microcosms in bringing about organizational change. In fact, we [...] strongly recommend this book for its innovative ideas, in spite of its tortured prose."
2,Not worth the wait,"Disappointing, Difficult to follow,and Forced. Not nearly as enjoyable as the other books in the series. Too much Holmes, not enough Nell - and three narrators is too many. This made the book too much like work and I read for pleasure."
4,Welcome back Irene Adler and Nell.,"Come join Ms. Douglas on a wild ride in Paris in spring of 1889. It is the year of the unveiling of the Eiffel Tower as well as the scene of the 1889 World's Fair. And Irene and Nell are on the trail of a particularly vicious killer. Could it be that Jack the Ripper who terrorized London last fall has moved on to Paris? There are a number of particularly gruesome killings involving women in Paris that spring. So Irene and Nell who are joined by a young American protegy called Pink are trying to stop the slaughters. With the aid of Sherlock Holmes, an American trapper called Buffalo Bill Cody, an Indian tracker called Red Tomahawk as well as some French Gendarmes, it looks like they may be successful. But be prepared this book leaves the reader with a mighty big cliff-hanger, so that we feel that we have to rush right out and get the next book in the series. Ms. Douglas' series is a winner. I am really enjoying the stories about Irene Adler."
5,Short but poignant notes a must read for teens and parents,"Lunch Bag Notes is a thoroughly enjoyable, sometime humorous, sometimes sad but always thought provoking book all teenagers and their parents should read. It is an excellent primer for teens trying to determine their life's direction and for teenagers and their parents to improve their communication with one another.Its journal format makes it an excellent keepsake."
3,just ok,"these type of cheese slicers are my favorite, but on a block of medium cheddar, it skips, rather than making a clean smooth cut. i probably wouldn't mind, but i have another slicer of the same type and it cuts smooth and steady. still a decent price for a decent product."
1,Just dreadful,"A bad, bad movie. Part of the problem was that whoever was responsible for the final form of the script (whether writer, director, producer, or studio) couldn't decide whether this was going to be a drama with comic overtones or vice versa. But even if this is supposed to be a sad film, it is sad without any redeeming aspects. Just a bunch of sad, unlikeable people. David Schwimmer's character is unbearably pathetic, Barbara Hershey's character is unbearable (and I have to add that I have always liked Barbara Hershey, so seeing her in this role was especially painful), Carol Kane as the mother is sad, and Schwimmer's friends are all superficial.I think the makers of the film were trying to emulate Albert Brooks, but with slight problem of not possessing his deft touch. A profoundly disappointing film. Though I must add that Gwyneth Paltrow was much better than the rest of the film. I kept feeling bad for her that she was stuck in some a poorly conceived film."
2,"Stagnant humor and uninspired, heavy-handed direction","This is one of those movies which simply blows away a good promise after the first half-hour...I just did not get it. The movie is directed almost completely avoid of any intention of creating humor, even in the scenes clearly written to be funny!!"
3,Pleasant enough little film.,"Despite the utter comtempt and loathing I have for Friends (For being the most obvious, stupid, unfunny comedy very muchlike the equally appalling Will & Grace), I nevertheless quite enjoyed David Swimmer's performance in this film. It was quite an enjoyable, lighthearted if slightly predictable romantic comedy. Paltrow was even reasonably good in it. So whilst not exactly a masterpiece, nonetheless an interesting little Black comedy for those moments whwn you have nothing else better to do."
1,Misleading,Was very disappointed because this was not the Electric Slide that has been around for years and everyone dances to at weddings. Waste of my time.
5,Timed Easy Reader w/Indigo light-Gold-tone,Purchased for my 93 year old mother who suffers w/dementia. She is thrilled with the fact she can read the numbers and especially that it lights up at night. Keeps her from getting up all hours of night. Yeah!
1,A Good Watch for People Who Don't See Well,"I bought this watch for my Mom because she couldn't read the face of her other watch. This watch is perfect for her to read, but the band is so small it barely fits around her wrist and she has a VERY SMALL wrist. I need to go buy another band for it so that it fits comfortably on her."
3,The band is too tight,"I had read several views before ordering this watch and I felt comfortable in believing that the wrist band would not be so tight as to pinch the skin....well guess what? It was too tight and pinches my skin so I am in the process of stretching out the band to see if that works. If not, I won't be wearing it. The light on it is a good feature and worth having."
3,wrist band size is important.,"It is nice, but wish it would have had a wrist band size that would have fit my wife's wrist. It was too tight and left red marks and a wrist band indention on her wrist. I guess we will have to go to a jewel place to have it resized."
4,Price of watch,"Just what I wanted. The price was higher than that at WalMart, however. Numbers not as large as I had expected."
1,Not happy with purchase,I bought the 'Psychic Golf Ball' as a stocking filling for the holidays.Very disapointed... you can't see the 'fore-teller'- the green liquid within the ball is too dark.
2,I dont like the overall movie but...,I dont like the overall movie but those terriosts in this movie with there aks where amazeing and like real terriosts would be... the overall movie was cheaply made and sucks except for the terriosts in this movie the acting they did was surpurb just for them I recommend this movie...
5,A must have for students and those in the airplane industry,"This is by far the best book on the subject of flighttesting in my opinion. In a very clear and pleasant way, Stinton presents the subjects, with some important insights into how to plan and execute a flight-test campaign, the usual difficulties and the likely outcomes. Some readers might find some of the techniques old-fashioned, mainly in the context of fully electronically-controlled airplanes, but even then this is the best starting point for learning why airplanes must be flight-tested and why its flying qualities are so important."
5,great movie,even my parents loved the movie. usually they ask who comes out in it and when i said nsync they thought it was going to be a stupid movie but it was pretty good. i cant stop renting it at blockbuster or watching it on encore.
4,Seriously...it doesn't suck!,"Okay, so I was not a fan of nsync when I saw this movie, my best friend made me go. But I was pleasantly surprised. It was easy to forget that these guys live day to day in popstar-dom. Lance was very believable this sweet, bumbling guy, who kind of reminded me of Winnie the Pooh! But Joey's the one who really made the movie. He had great comic timing, and was really just hysterical. If you're one of those people who thinks we should have more movies that are just plain fun, then this is definately a good choice. I loved it!!"
1,"Hands down, worst movie I ever saw","Wow. WOW! What a spectacular display of mediocrity. Lance Bass is by far the worst actor I have ever seen. The story line is not only stupid, but unbelievable as well. Joey Fatone's character is ridiculously horrible. Did anyone notice how, as a singer, the majority of the movie he is TERRIBLE, until the very end when he pens a poignant love song for his good friend Kevin, who until that point he had [left hanging]...I almost shed a tear.Seriously, if you want to compare this cinematic nightmare to Crossroads, with Brittney Spears, she deserves an Oscar. As an N*Sync fan, I can honestly say that I have lost so much respect for these boys. Good thing Joey redeemed himself in My Big Fat Greek Wedding. And the funniest part of the movie was at the end when Justin & Chris from N*Sync make a cameo. Don't see this movie. It is 90 minutes of your life you will never get back."
2,Not the best,I saw this movie and was so excited to see it and it ended up being pretty bad. Emmanuelle Chriqui has alot of talent and so does Joey Fatone. It is a funny movie but Lance can't act.
3,a young love in the big city movie,"Not exactly a teen movie or a chick flick but with elements of both this is a pretty predictable boy finds girl,both loses girl, boys finds girl again.The acting is sort of minimal with the female lead being probably the most believable. The music is very trendy and new century, but at times not as good as billed?Over all it was an entertaining movie:a fluff piece."
5,A nice film for a change,"Speaking personally, I enjoyed this film: it is lite, entertaining, and entirely devoid of smut and violence, entertaining enough for the whole family to watch and enjoy, thoroughly harmless good fun. Just a really nice story about two likeable people who you desperately want to see get together. Hey, everybody knows people like this: sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't.Maybe it's not quite ""Sleepless in Seattle"", but if you liked that one, then this one will appeal to you.Anyrate, that's the opinion of one world-weary and jaded fellow who hasn't enjoyed a romantic comedy so much for a very long time."
2,Similar to old movie....,"When I first heard what ""On the Line"" was about, I was first reminded of an old classic movie featuring Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, and Jules Munshin called ""On the Town"". It is about three sailors who get one night of leave on the town in NYC. Gene Kelly's character meets a girl on the train, and the rest of the movie is spent searching for her.Sounds pretty similar, eh? Well, ""On the Line"" isn't too bad... it's corny, but that's what we all can expect from it. I'm not even sure if i'd call this a slumber party movie, but oh well whatever floats your boat. I'm an N Sync fan myself, and I do like Lance Bass.... but I couldn't find myself to like this movie. You should all check out ""On the Town"" instead...the music in that is more entertaining ;)"
3,It's all good . . . well . . .,"First off I'd like to say there was no stealing of plots. It happens. Remember when Deep Impact came out at the same time as Armageddon? It happens all the time.I am a huge *NSYNC fan (who is over the age of 21) and I did see this movie, knowing it wasn't going to be the greatest. It was cute but too cute for me. The best part is the ending credits with Chris and Justin doing small cameo's. They made the movie!! (they are the reason I give it 3 stars)If you aren't an *NSYNC fan I would not recommend this movie but if you ARE, it's a definite must."
4,Good Movie,"I just saw the movie today, and yeah i loved it, all the critics can shove it. This is a great movie, and it is funny, go see it."
1,Lance and Joey [no way]!,"Please someone help me, [...]!! Why did joey and lance even bother!! They cannot act worth beans!! I can't believe I even wanted to see it. If yo0u want to see this terrible movie FORGET about it!!"
1,Don't waste your time.,"This book has gotten good reviews in this forum, but I'd like to offer a dissenting viewpoint. This book may have a ""lively"" style but it is poorly researched. It appears as though the author did no research in archives. The material has all appeared elsewhere. The bulk of the book is based on secondary sources. Fully 85% of the footnotes are from secondary sources. Some quotations are rendered with no footnotes at all. The footnotes aren't even consistent in their form. This a poorly researched & sloppily edited book. There are much better books on Charles that you can get."
2,a bit boring,"i'm sorry to inform fans of LCD Soundsystem of the following: monotony can easily be mistaken for intricate and artistic subtlety. unfortunately, this album presents the former and is credited with the latter. just because you have a good drum and bass line doesn't mean you shouldn't deviation from it-- use some samples to compliment it and allow it to blossom (and don't try to get away with ripping off a beatles riff and repeating it for five minutes). as far as alternative dance goes, your better off with the avalanches or dj shadow. this is just a more tedious version of the talking head's remain in light album. fah."
2,Sorry but...hype rules..,I bought this on the basis of reviews..Uncut among others..and I am dissapointed...the 3rd cut is ok.. the rest...banal..did not move me in the least...searching for the lost chord and did not find it here...still searching...
5,LOOK NO FURTHER,This blade will cut nearly anything with ease. I've used many of these in the plumbing heating and air conditioning business over the years. This one outlasts all the others. And not only the Milwaukee brand but it will outlast all other brands as well. You know it has to be tough to cut cast iron. And it is. It will not only cut cast iron but will cut through nail embedded wood etc without dulling and wearing right out like most of the other types. In fact nails are not a problem because they are relatively soft compared to cast iron which it cuts through with ease. I began using these over 20 years ago and have never found a better blade for any amount of money. Forget those diamond coated pieces of crap. They cut but poorly. I've had one of these last for over a year with regular use. Name another blade that will do that.
2,"A Dud, unless you're training the most basic class","I was hoping to have an off the shelf option for my communications training program, but alas, this is a real dud. The information is very basic, and unfortunately, the accompanying PPT slides are mediocre at best. Keep looking. This one isn't your answer unless you're working with high schoolers."
3,Communication Behavioral Skills Training Books Fall Short by Nature,Communication Skills are behavioral by nature and therefore books often times miss the mark in trying to convey the teaching of such skills. Content organization or creation of PowerPoint presentations lend themselves to the written word very well. But trying to create behavioral skills training through the media of the written word is just not very effective. Overall the book is good as are all the ASTD training books but there is nothing like taking an actual training with video feedback from professionals that model the behavioral to get the biggest bang for your buck. I would buy this book but understand that the content pieces are of most value.
5,A master document of the 80's,"The characters are incredibly well-written. The story is engaging. And Gil, our anti-hero, is the prototypical 80's guy in search of meaning in his life. I absolutely loved every word of this book and can't wait to read Gospel, Barnhardt's next book. I laughed out loud at least 5 times during this book. It left me so warm and happy that my wife, who almost never reads books I recommend, is reading it now and loves it"
1,Bubble Boy,I need to send the movie back. I haven't been able to find time on how to do this. The dvd keeps playing another movie trailer and won't start Bubble Boy.
1,Brilliant!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is a marvelous piece of acting and directing!! I mean I saw this art work and couldn't believe the incredible story I witnessed. First of all, the acting is genius, the directing incredible, the soundtrack mezmirizing!! This movie was robbed at the acadamy awards. This is possibly the finest movie of all time!!!!!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED.In actual truth this movie is added up into one word:CRAP.You may have noticed I was being sarcastic. But seriously don't waste your precious time on this utter garbage. Jake Gylanhole (I think that's how you spell it.) really hit rock bottom with this pyle of dung!! This movie is an insult to comedy and just about anything good in this world.Please don't waste your cash on this. PLEASE."
3,Good But Not Great. Not A Keeper!,"The Matchmakers is a good but not great romance book from the Harlequin Romance Book Publishing Company and it is just not one of their best and is not one of the author Debbie Macomber's best. It is about a woman named Dori Roberts who is either divorced or a widow and her son decides it is time for her to get a new husband and places an ad in the newspaper and Gavin Parker is a man who sees the ad and gets the wrong idea by thinking that Dori is a man hungry woman, etc and she thinks he is an arrogant jerk, etc."
3,OK,"The acting in this was not realy that good. In the movie, the mother doesn't seam to age the way she should.and talk about being disfunctional............ But the movie didn't have any scratches or problems playing. and it arived in a timely manner."
4,Julianne's Return to Form,"While this film was at times uncomfortable to watch, Julianne Moore has definitely returned to the dramatic acting she's so good at it with it. It's worth watching just for her performance, she is super fierce!"
2,Do not Waste Your Time!!!,This movie is so uneven it is hard to understand what is going on --the plot--where is it--it is all mixed up. Julianne Moore is good but her talents are wasted here. Don't bother with this one. What a bore!!!
3,true to book,"a very disturbing story, but very true to the book and what did occur. The movie did not have the time to delve into the son's spiraling mental condition and what happened to him after the murder. The written screen shots at the end could not portray the severity of his mental illness and his self destructive behaviors. The movie and the reading of the book combination really shows the sickness of the mother...."
1,Dreary Slush,A waste of the brilliant Julianne Moore's talent. Good for some violent cheapo thrills and as much fun as a crushed puppy. Awful dawg of a movie and nearly laughable if it weren't all so very sad.
3,"Not bad, but nothing spectacular either.","The problem with this movie is, that the makers just could not decide what sort of movie they were making. Is it a romantic comedy? Is it a thriller? It might even be an action movie! Now one could say that I Love Trouble offers something to any kind of audience, but the truth is that it has become to much of a compromise. Nolte and Roberts try hard and their performances go a long way towards saving a rather uninteresting movie, but personally I think that their efforts should have been used on a better script producing a better balanced story. On the whole this is a nice movie, but not something you want to see more than one time."
4,Louis RIP,"Chip Benedict is the hero/villain -- you pick. Unlike his dad and granddad but a man of honour at least in his own mind. Unresolved ambiguity in a well written story of ""honour"" in mid 20th century America."
3,It's all Greek to me,"It might take some time getting used to how this works, but I'm kind of lost. I wish there was some type of instruction on how to use this thing."
3,"It's The ""Scary Movie"" For The Erotic Thrillers!!!","""Scary Movie"" made fun of hit horror movies like ""Scream"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"". This one makes fun of the hit drama/thriller movies like ""Fatal Attraction"", ""Basic Instinct"", ""Sleeping With The Enemy"", etc. All of which have to do with psychotic women killers and turbulent marriages. This movie re-creates scenes from all the movies while making them amusing and kind of stupid. Like the boiling pot, rollercoater, and bathtub scenes from ""Fatal Attraction"". It's pretty funny but gets kind of stupid and confusing."
1,defective part,I believe that this alternator has a bad bearing and need to know where is should be sent. AC Delco gives it a 12 month warranty and it is only been in service for 30 days. The return privilege with Amazon expires today. Your help is appreciated! Ed
1,Don't throw your money away,"Worst watch I have ever bought. I received it yesterday, and it's in the trash today. As soon as I put it on, the pins holding the links together began falling out. The wrist band was instantly scratched almost as if it has a fake stainless coating. For being a ""Swiss made"" master time piece that is supposed to have had extensive hours devoted to quality and craftsmen ship, the outer time ring did not line up with the numbers, and yes I turned it, and the second hand started at 7 seconds off instead of at 12 when you reset the chronograph. I don't ever write reviews on products, but I am so disgusted with this POS that I wanted to keep anyone else from wasting their money."
2,not really very good,"this latin dictionary has some serious shortcomings. lacking any sort of overview of usage is a real problem. even more serious, some of the definitions are really not quite right. not up to standard of the big OLD, and not as good a pocket dictionary as Chambers Murray"
3,Care Solutions: Caring For The People Whho Care of You,Basic care for home health admission. Not helpful for me as I was looking for caring for the elderly.
3,"Follows a Great Album, Precedes a Great Album","This album is just not the best Depeche Mode. I like the SOFAD album, but there are several songs that still kind of make me sick to this day. There are standout songs, however, namely ""In Your Room"", and I love rocking out to ""Rush"", but as a whole, the Violator album that came before SOFAD, and the Ultra album that came a few years later are far superior pieces of work. Thankfully Depeche Mode survived this dark period both musically and in their lives to make better music in the years to follow."
5,ELECTRONIC ROCK,"After their best-seller Violator, Depeche Mode came back more powerful than ever with this album.Incorpoating their trademark electronic sound with a more organic 'rock' style, the Mode achieved a heavier, yet uplifting atmosphere with each track.Opening with the first single from the album, I Feel You has what singer Dave Gahan described as a ""bluesy, rock and roll"" sound - a strong indication that DM were, once again pushing their music in a different sonic direction.Other notable tracks include: In Your Room - a slow-building epic track which, along with Mercy In You and Higher Love, leave you in a trance-like state from their 'big' sound.The music isn't the only powerful aspect to the songs - Martin Gore's lyrics upon first listen, have a darkness to them but listen closely and you'll hear how they are also positive and very uplifting - one of the most intriguing things about Depeche Mode!Certainly one of the 'top 3' albums in the DM catalogue - definitely worth purchasing."
2,People actually like this album???,"Strange, I thought it was really bad. Actually DM hasn't put out an audibly palatible release since Violator. It's too bad I used to really love them and could always rely on them. Well at least their back catalogue is still available. Too bad we can't go back and delete this one especially. Ugh!"
4,Finding the Indo-Europeans,"I wanted to add a very brief review of this book, which I read many years ago and have returned to now with some new research I am doing on Proto-Indo-Europeans. I was reminded what a great overview of the subject this book is and what a wealth of information it contains. It is one of my favorite books on the topic of Indo-Europeans.Mallory does an excellent job of presenting and condensing a mountain of historical, mythological, archaeological, liguistic, and genetic information, theories, and evidence into a concise relatively easy to read book that stays on topic. He also manages to offer a logical resolution to the Indo-European ""homeland"" debate.I would recommend this book to anyone as the perfect starting point in Indo-European studies."
3,Second string,"Well this is not the land made version, made in france ...is liscensed by company feel like i bought a fake rolex looks good but i know its not the real deal hand made....not bad though...mine came in 2 tone brass stainless who knows"
2,Excellent only for critical analysis,"This film has only one redeeming quality- it provides an excellent opportunity to discuss bias, historical perspective, director's artistic liscence, and distortion of historical events. I viewed this film knowing that the Chinese, poorly portrayed by Americans or British, were being presented from a completely demeaning perspective that simultaneously plays the Americans as the savior heros. I plan to use this in my 7th grade social studies class to demonstrate exactly how a series of events as complex and consequential as the Boxer Rebellion can be recreated so completely and utterly wrong. Watch this as you would a Disney film like Mulan, knowing that it will only get the gist of something, and not provide any reliable characters or history."
1,Terrible,"To glorify the intruding foreigners' actions in China in the wake of the Opium Wars during the late colonial period is a terrible thing to do. Doing so is along the same lines as glorifying the Nazis' actions in the invasion of Poland and in the Holocaust.To put things into perspective, for those who may not understand just how bad (morally) this movie is, imagine how Jewish people might feel, should a Hollywood movie be released that not only viewed the Holocaust from the Nazi perspective, but went so far as to glorify their actions.Looking at it from the other side's perspective is one thing (the German perspective of WWII and Holocaust, or in the case of this movie the foreigners' perspective). However, glorifying it is something else altogether - and this movie crossed the line in no small measure.To add insult to injury, the Chinese characters were portrayed by white actors, and even caricatured."
1,Cannot count to two,I only received one of the two pack of seat warmers. I received the second one after finding the right phone number to call and they after they got around to sending it. It does not fit properly on the seat. It akes the entire time of my morning commute--45 minutes---to begin to heat. Total waste of money. I did not return it because with the original shipping and handling cost and the return cost it will not be wise to return it. I just need to accept that I was taken by this company. I suggest you only buy this product if you have nothing better to do with your money.
5,Beautiful African Melodies,"This is the first exposure I've had to Miriam and I love this Album! I do believe she has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard. The rambunctious "" click"" song is great."
5,The Song bird,This is an excelent CD by an equaly brilliant star who sadly is no more. This is the finest collection of Ma Afica's best songs she had performed in her lon and illustrious career. She will always have a special place in my heart and always remain the Queen of African music along with Cesaria Evora. A must have in any music lover's collection.
5,What a surprise,"Saw it on TV not long after it was made. Never heard of Gene Wilder at the time, either. We just started to watch and started to laugh. What a terrific movie! What a funny guy! Now go out and rent ""The Frisco Kid."" You'll love it."
5,So Funny!!!,This one of the funniest movies I have ever seen!!! I laughed out loud watching this movie.
3,three caballeros,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
4,A childhood classic,"I used to watch this movie repeatedly when I was young at my grandparent's house. It is one of the next movies that I am going to buy to add to my Disney collection... I really liked it, especially that little bird, and I remember dancing and singing to the song ""Three Caballeros."" The only part I didn't like was the end, but that may just be a childhood thing."
2,Not for everyone...,"I like what is presented, but I don't like how it was done.TOO MUCH NARRATION!!My 5 year old cannot follow who is talking... the actual charactor or the INVISIBLE narrator in the movie.I think it is too confusing and sexy for little kids.We owned this movie for almost 2 years and watched it only twice.It is educational about different cultures and the music is very enjoyable...so maybe a little older kids and adults can enjoy it more."
2,Doesn't fit with big feet.,"I bought a size 9M. I usually wear size 9 in all types of shoes. When I tried these boots on, the toe box was too small and when I tried zipping up the boot, it was difficult when it came up to my calves. At the ankles the material also slouched, and looked so awkward on me, probably because it was made with a not good material."
5,Love these boots - my second pair!,"I bought a pair of these a couple of years ago and loved them. They don't last like real leather does, but that's the price you pay for vegan shoes, and they were such a reasonable price that I feel I got more than my money's worth in compliments when I wore them!I was delighted to find these in my size, on sale on Amazon and snapped them up. I'll still wear the old ones for slogging around the park with the dogs, and wear these when I go out.They are very comfortable. I bought them in 10M - my size is 9.5M but that's a hard size to find in any shoe, and size 10 works perfectly with this boot. I could jog in them if I was so inclined! And they're sexy - badass without being too ""butch""!I definitely recommend these boots. If they're still around in a couple years, I'll probably buy yet another pair!"
2,"looked nice, fit poorly","I bought these boots cause I wanted a pair of boots to wear out in the sticks. They're not warm, too tight to wear thick socks on under, they're hard to lace. And wear on my ankles after about 3 hours. I have thicker calves, and have these laced to fit, but they're not worth the 30 I paid for them. I waited until we went camping to wear them and unfortunately that was well past the return time.... I own other Volatile shoes these are by far the most unimpressive ones I've bought"
5,Awesome boots,"I just got them in, delivery was sooner than expected. They are very comfy, and look great with leggings, jeans, just about anything! I want to order the Tank boot next because it would be nice to have a shorter boot too. The material seem durable, and i know they will lost long if i take care of them. I am very satisfied"
2,not worth it,"I have never been so disappointed in a soundtrack before. I just spent good money on the soundtrack from the movie ""Connie and Carla"" with a total playing time of 27 minutes how absolutely pathetic. I will think long and hard before I spend my money on another Sony Soundtrack in the future!"
4,Beginning Banjo - this dvd works,"I previously tried to learn how to play with a combination of instructional books. I failed so miserably that the banjo sat in the closet for 5 years. After 1 week with this dvd, I'm making music and getting better every day. You will not be disappointed!"
2,"Great instructor,",It is easier and much more understandable with this instructor who takes his time and really shows the basics
5,Best ROTJ Han Solo EVER!!!,"This is the best remake of the Han Solo figure with trenchcoat done. It surpasses the original vintage figure from 1984, which was the best for its time. This Han figure has the correct shirt, brown pants as seen in ROTJ with yellow strips, a working holster, and the trenchcoat has real pockets to place his hands in like the photograph!!!This representation of Han Solo is the definitive version in the outfit most seen in ROTJ. This figure could not have been better."
4,Scooby unleashed,"While this films plot has holes the size of Wisconsin in it, it is a fun movie. I would even venture to say that it is more fun than the original. The monsters are straight from the pages of Scooby Doo history, and we get to see a little more actualy crime solving (not to mention Velma in orange leather). The charecters get a little more development and actually seem to have more than one emotion. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddy Prinze Jr have NO on-screen chemistry (lord only knows what their home life is like). There is no one one more perfect for Shaggu nor do I think anyone could out-Velma Linda Cardelini. If you go into tht theatre expecting anything other than a good time and a few laughs, you will be disappointed. But if you accept it for what it is, you will enjoy this movie a lot."
5,So Much Better Then The First!,"As big of a fan as i was for the first one, i was excited to see this one. This one is so much better because it revisits some of the classic monsters from several of the shows. Such as the Pterodactyl Ghost, 10,000 Volt Ghost, Miner 49er, and the list goes on and on. If you were a fan of the first and even if you weren't give this one a try, it is definately one of the better sequels out there."
5,Excellent Read,This book starts off slow but don't give up on it because it gets really good. This is an excellent book for the tight knit women's book club. My group loved it!
1,Time Waster,"I found this book a complete waste of my time. I kept wondering when the story would begin. I oftened wondered why I continued turning pages.I'll have to agree with an earlier reviewer (which I wish I had read before reading the book!) that questioned the the merit of this book being a bestseller. Mr. Clancy: quality, not quantity, please!"
2,HO HUM,"Book by book Clancy is slipping away from the ""soul grabbing"" action style of ""The Hunt for Red October"". Rather than being called a ""techno thriller"", it should be labelled a ""red tape sleeper"". The charactors are well designed but,we spend too much time listening to phone calls and reading E-mails. I look forward to the return of the ""old"" Tom Clancy."
5,You were expecting Freddy Krueger?,Very pleased with this movie... how could you not like something with the Two Coreys...Storyline was great...It's a movie I'll be able to watch over and over again... A Must Buy
4,Great 80s Flick,"If you're looking for a great saturday afternooner, put this movie on your list. The plot runs a little deeper than the average teeny bopper film - diving into dreams and the meaning of life - but it still has that 80s charm: wacky wardrobe, hot hair dos, and sassy slang."
3,Not bad,"Although there have been other and more solid theories out there about the motive and perpetrators of director William Desmond Taylor's murder in 1922, this one has an added level of interest because Kirkpatrick tells the story of a high-level sleuth. King Vidor, well-known director and contemporary of Taylor's, investigated the crime over the course of decades and this book is the result of that inquiry. As I said, the finale is not completely convincing (and may be a bit of a cop-out), but for anyone interested in Hollywood's dark side in the 20s, this is a great read. Considering we have no way of knowing exactly who killed Taylor, this theory is as valid as many others in circulation."
3,Amazing...but a lot different than the manga.,"This show is genuinely good. The only problems I have with it is that it's SO MUCH MORE DIFFERENT THAN THE MANGA. The manga is so good. How could you taint that? And I absolutely can't stand how they redid the theme song from Japanese and the credits song into American. They sound like crap. And Haruhi's voice sounds like a man. I prefer the manga way over the anime, but I still really enjoy the anime."
2,Great 80s pop/dance.... but what's with the bad edit?,"Any real fans of Samantha Fox will already own these songs. But for casual fans or those just looking to add some 80s hits to their music collection, prepare for disappointment. The songs are catchy, but the first time I played this disc I was caught off-guard: the most popular U.S. single, ""Naughty Girls (Need Love Too)"" is a poorly edited version, not one that any radio stations played. I can't figure out why they'd decide to make the edits. On top of that, I can't figure out who decided that the edits actually sound good... when I heard them, I was convinced that my CD was scratched. They were THAT noticeable.The short story: If you want ""Naughty Girls"", find it on another compilation."
4,Good 80s Reminiscence,"A number of the reviewers who panned this album apparentely did so because of Samantha's other activities, such as posing topless for magazines. That stuff is irrelevant to how the album sounds. Overall, the album is a good compilation of 80s dance/pop music. Solid ear candy for children of the 80s. Even if Sam's voice isn't the greatest [but I'm not the best judge - not a vocalist myself], it doesn't matter that much because the catchy melodies and grooves are what matter to this type of music. This album is bouncy; makes for good background music while you're doing stuff around the house. Worth it."
1,Might as well dip your hands in olive oil,"I received this as a gift. It smells like Vicks chest rub, and feels so disgustingly greasy."
3,Vietnam Era Watch,"Excellent service in delivery but watch is what you pay for. It's cheap, made in China, quit working the 3rd day. If you want a cheap watch that works, try somewhere else."
2,bad.bad.bad,"such a bad movie. i can't believe how many good reviews this film has received. first of all, a good horror movies either has good gore/story or both. mulberry street has neither. horror fans want to see some blood. nothing really happens in the first 40 minutes or so, the audiece is painfully forced to watch the comings and goings of a group of people. there is no charater development at all. if the write and director wants a good story, then they must have good character develoment so the audience can relate to them. these pathetic character have nothing to do with the plot. and when the reall horror begins, there is nothing scary or even remotely original. in fact, i hate these charaters so much, and i cannot wait to see them being attacked and eaten. the apocalpse/zombie story has been done countless times, but others do a much better job. this film makes me angry. avoid it"
2,content,"the book was fair, not as i expected, the book just draged on and on,i quit reading half way through."
3,Berry is oustanding!,"As someone who has a great interest in movies, and the lives of the people that make them, I knew that this movie was a must see for me. Halle Berry totally shines in the film, and I can see why she got the Golden Globe. This is better than your average made for cable movie, and worth a look if you want to see how hollywood dreams true and how they end so sadly."
1,Dane Elec flash drive,"Don't buy from this company! I was desparate and had to buy what the store had in stock. I loaded all my work files to take on vacation. When I tried to access, it said the drive had not been formatted. I've tried formatting many times and then storing test files. Same results each time. I contacted them twice with no response.STEAR CLEAR!"
3,The Trick is,"Ok, so I've read a lot of complaints about this product. You see the trick to it is, you don't start counting until you feel the burn in your thighs. I'm starting to notice the fast disolve from my inner thighs and my bottom. As for my abs well I use a stability ball to do crunches so I can't really tell if this really gets the abs. It takes a little time getting used to actually pushing down on the pedals. But hey I'm seeing results. :0)"
1,Worthless piece of junk,"My wife bought the LTT about a year ago, from the info-mercial, for waaay too much money (total was around $175). It's largely gone un-used, and even with that, it is malfunctioning and breaking. I repaired it once (got rid of metal shavings in the bearings....clearly they used the lowest quality possible), and two weeks later, it is already malfunctioning again. The movement is not smooth, the stance required is unnatural (pigeon-toed), and it only works my quads. I'm throwing this thing away, as I get a much better workout from climbing real stairs."
1,Horrible Service,Stay far away from anything to do with sportrus.com!! The service is horrible. I order 3 weeks ago. My credit card was charged the day after I ordered and I was told it would be shipped the next day - 2 weeks later still no item. I contacted sportrus.com only to find out the e-mail address I was given was invalid. I finally got a valid e-mail address from Amazon only to be told that I knew it would be delayed when I purchased and that it had continued to be on back order and the Trikk would be shipped as soon as they came in stock. So this review is about the lateral thigh trainer - I never ordered a Trikk. They also told me my credit card would not be changed until the item was ready to be shipped (right - I have been getting interest on it are they going to pay it back?) I have sent multiple e-mails asking why I was charged and still no order - they are not answering. I will never use this company again. :(
3,there are better POW movies,"I tend to agree with the tendays komyathy review. While I'm sure this film was a major achievement in its day, I don't think it has aged particularly well. While it is definitely worth watching for those interested in the history of cinema, I think in that in this vein, some other POW movies (like ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" and ""King Rat"") pack a much bigger punch."
1,Stick To 'Ghetto Music',The commercial failure of KRS1s didactic venom is a tribute to the good taste of American rap fans. He has done better.
5,Fine Little Pass-par-tout!,"Handy, smooth, colorful, small sized -perfect travel companion for anyone who loves browsing the maps and dreaming off the far-off places...I particularly love how countries come and go, they exist for some time and then they disappear; people make up new flags, elect new capitals, new governments, the whole spiel is such fun to observe."
2,awkward design,"This brush is not worth the $12 it cost to get it to me.Design looks acceptable but it is very awkward,hard to find a comfortable position where the brushcan be used properly and doesn't slip out of my hand."
1,Harry Potter-like...,"The author chose to self puplish this book for a reason. It is a Harry Potter look-a-like that puts down Harry Potter and a religion. The Religion is modern witchcraft,commonly called Wicca. The author did not do any research on her books and it shows.I hope that if Ms. Mongomery decides to write more books she will know better of what she speaks."
5,Old school best!,"Shan and marley marl is awesome together!,i cant understand why these 2 pioneers of rap is never brought up in old school debates.....they should defintely be mention among the elite from that era its just raw hip hop at its finest.."
1,One of Her Worst,"I love this author, but could not stand this book. The reason, for those of you who might still like this book, was the combination of romance and mysticism/magic/healing. In a romance, I like to read about characters that can be understood and that I like. I neither liked nor understood this ""healer"" at all."
1,The Worst of Katherine Sutcliffe's Books,"Generally Katherine Sutcliffe writes a well-rounded, interesting novel with good character development. This book lacked in every way. I was most uncomfortable with the main male character; he seemed to be senselessy abusive in nature. Similarly, why the main female character, Hope, endured it was a poor model and was greatly disappointing. Not a very ""politically correct"" example of healthy relationships given the epidemic of physical abuse in our culture today."
2,not what i expected,"I was really excited about this book..at least until I read it. Granted, I only read a few chapters then decided it wasn't worth my time, but I felt like this book didn't say much about the actual child. It was more of what the dad should be doing (like great detail on how to save up for the child's college). That's good info but I bought the book to learn about stages of my child's development and different techniques to handle these, not finances. So yes, this book is probably good for a very specific target group (let's say 9-5 job upper middle class 30+ year old father with the traditional role) but didn't apply to our equal responsibility, equal respect, young, just barely making it financially, household."
1,"waste of money, leaks, only looks good","Sure, this coffee maker is beautiful on the counter, but it's terrible. The coffee carafe leaks, it's difficult to slide the carage back into place, and worse, the top is poorfly ventilated so mold grows under the cover if you don't keep it open. Nice concept but poorly executed."
2,Beautiful Design but flawed...,Would definitely buy another one if design flaws were corrected. Great to look at.Coffee sometimes overflows where filter meets carafe. Thats a lot of spill.Stains easily.
4,Ducati for the Coffee Table,"Large format, entertaining copy and great photos make this a must for Ducatisti. A broad look at everything Ducati from the beginning."
4,Small Flaws,"I bought this for my twelve year-old son who'd gotten very skilled with a ""regular"" pogo-stick and needed to move on. We found the FlyBar and I bought it for him for Christmas. Generally it behaves as advertised, however there are a few minor flaws I'd like to share. The most significant is that one of the four threaded holes where screws fit to hold the cover in place was neither drilled nor threaded. We decided to live with it and hold the cover on with the remaining three screws, it being Christmas it's hard to tell a twelve year-old you need to ship his prize gift back for a new one.He started to use it for a while, on days it wasn't snowing, and a small insignificant part broke. This didn't disable the pogo-stick but this is a heavy-duty high-end product and that shouldn't happen."
2,Not Very Interesting,I could not get interested in this at all. Maybe 4-5 pages held my interest. Each chapter deals with a different character in the village or an event that happened - not a lot of continuity - the characters weren't engrossing enough to make me want to know more about them. I love books about Italy and Tuscany in particular but this would be pretty low on my list.
3,good entry level meter,"I am a little disappointed with Extech, I own other meters from them, and they cut corners with this one. First - there is no power button. The selector dial turns it on and has an 'off' position. It takes 2 hands to turn the dial, whereas you could hit a simple 'on' button with one finger to do a quick battery test.It has a battery check, which measures batteries under load, however it is on the OPPOSITE side of the regular voltage test so you need to turn the dial 180 degrees to switch between them. (my MV110 has the same issue)It has very long leads - 52 inches - to wrap around the meter. It uses a 9V battery instead of the traditional AA. I was considering the EX410, but I like that this one is short and compact. It is an ugly and non-professional green color. The audible beep is a little quiet."
4,"Very cool, great for kids or for decorating a room","I won this at my church. It's a very neat scooby doo toy, measuring 8"" from nose to toe. He has a cute little tong hanging out. His legs are bent the way they are in the show. His collar is leather, but unfortunately does not include a classic 'SB' collar tag attached to his blue leather collar. Overall, a super fun toy. I use mine to sit on top of my game boy, which is really cute because he looks like a little guard dog."
5,Definitely worth having,"If you splurged on the HDR-HC 1, then, please go ahead and buy this as well ! A good investment so you can use the camcorder better. This was my first camcorder purchase, so I was a novice when I bought it. The DVD was very helpful."
4,West Coast Classic/ Oakland Great,"When that beat drops and Pooh says ""drop the top, hit the block, beat slammin"".....on the F'wit dank remix, how can you not want to nod your head and turn up the amp in your car. That song takes me back to kickers, Rockford Fosgate's and Pyle driver speakers in an 85 corrola. It's a hard album. First time I heard Eatin' P***y track I had to listen to it at a low level like a Eddie Murphy Raw tape. Classic album. This is the reason they put him in menace to society. He was just gangsta. He's the reason Too Short moved to Atlanta. Somebody should have told Short that you don't want to beef with a guy that holds up Wal-mart stores in between studio sessions. No joke."
4,Twisted,"Itâ€˜s a little sick, a little twisted, but you simply have to keep reading. This was a very interesting read and as I approached the final chapters I was shocked by the outcome."
4,weird and very good,"This is a consistently imaginative book. It's a blast to read. It almost slips too far from reality in the final third, but it was certainly one of the funnest books I ever read."
4,Outstanding book about a family of side-show freaks,"Jim Rose, the leader in the current side-show freak revival, is said to have been inspired by this tale of old time traveling family freak shows. If you've ever wanted to eat fire or hammer a nail in your nose, this is the book for you. I have seen Jim Rose's side show freaks, and while I am not old enough to have seen the last of the traveling carnivals (alas!), this book by Katherine Dunn captures the spirit of those days. The family is led by two parents, born and raised in the circus, who do amazing and horrifying things to their bodies in order to birth a family of side-show freaks. A tragedy of a ""norm"" results in them leaving the baby on a church doorstep. The writing by Katherine Dunn allows you to feel the disgust for norms, and almost makes you with you were a freak as well. Ms. Dunn is a very fine author"
2,Didn't get it,"I read this book for book club and I am one of the few disenters here. A long, involved story with such fast, unsatisfying ending. It was a quick conclusion that left many questions unanswered. Without giving away the ending, can anyone tell me why Ellie did what she did at the end? I cannot find the reason. It's loose ends like this that frustrated me. I also really didn't care for the main characters. I could only sympathize with Oly for so long, I didn't care for Miranda - I only really liked Chick and I felt pretty much only the twins were especailly intrigueing. A lot of reading with little satisfaction for me."
3,"Odd, very odd, but somehow works","This book is a fun, sometime disturbing read. It walks a weird tightrope between suspending belief for the sake of sensation, and real, powerful feelings and actions that could not be ignored. I did not like the Arty evil route - it was so disturbing that it was hard to believe and while I see why it was one route for the story, it made it a challenge to continue reading. Overall, definitely read it and discuss, but it won't stay on my shelf."
5,An Unforgettable Novel,"I'm a horror reader and heard so much about this book via a horror discussion list I belong to. This will have to be one of the best books I've ever read. I recommend it to people who want to be introduced into the genre. It's haunting, tragic, horrific, beautiful. I couldn't put it down. I cried at the end - I couldn't help myself. A poetic ending and the exact way I wanted to story to conclude.I now look at what we term ""beautiful"" in a different light and that sometimes being beautiful on the outside can be a disadvantage.I will never forget this tale - ever."
4,Oddly Beautiful...,"I picked up this book on a whim and couldn't put it down until I was finished. The book, in it's manipulation of the revolting as spectacle, creates its own brand of beauty and logic. What strikes me most is how we as readers have an opportunity to see life after the carnival, not just during it. A most unexpected and unique take on the theme, ""people make mistakes."" I would highly reccommend this book."
1,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed in Geek Love. I read it based on a recommendation in an article from Time magazine. It was very hard for me to even finish-halfway through it I almost put it down. If I had gotten it from the library, rather than purchasing it, I would have tossed it aside quickly. The author went way overboard trying to shock the reader. It was not even realistic. The reviews for this work definitely misled me."
2,Disappointing,I picked up this book after reading Michio Kaku's Parallel Worlds. This book was a disappointing read compared to the before mentioned book - which is a clear and engaging read. The cosmic landscape jumps around a lot (especially in the beginning) and it simply isn't as readable as the before mentioned book.
3,Not a good attempt at science popularization,It suffers greatly (more than others) from the common fault in popular science books. It attempts to explain complicated concepts for the lay reader while omitting the necessary mathematical rigor. The result is predictable - the ideas are clear neither to the lay reader nor to more mathematically inclined one. A lot of long winded explanations that could be made clear by the inclusion of a little of mathematics. Why not include at least some of the math and take the time to explain it? The writing is somewhat tedious and it seems the author likes to boast a bit too much. The attempts at humor are horrible and face palming inducing. Well at least he did not put his face on the cover as some other physicist and writer of popular science books who shall remain nameless.

Difference is that they were happy they were going to planet earth and Brit looks like she missed the Mother Trip. Unfortunately she sings that way too. Hmmmm. Now we have her greatest ""hits,"" really? And doing ""My Prerogative?"" Crank up the band HIGHER guys I can still hear her. Brit shouldn't touch work done by her betters.

2,"It's pretty, but it lags","It's very pretty, but even with a P3 500mhz voodoo 3 the game loses frames. The tanks don't handle like they used to. The emphasis is on action. I wouldn't recomend it for strategy fans or action fans."
1,Ridiculous price,Just a heads up that the current list price of $300+ on this cable is insane! There are various other HDMI to DVI-D cables available on Amazon for under twenty dollars.
3,And Then There Were None,"Ten Little Indians (And Then There Were None) was a startling and clever mystery about ten interesting people with questionable backgrounds together on a strange island. At first it was hard to keep track of ten characters' personalities and pasts. I liked how the tension grew with each ""death,"" but I wish the living characters' guilt would have come out more. The setting of a plain, new, contemporary house on a straightforward island near the mainland that was regularly used for parties made it even more mysterious. It made the story more mysterious because they could easily conclude that they were the only ones on the island, there weren't any hiding places, and it wasn't the classic old mansion and thunderstorm, murder mystery setting. This made for a well-developed and suspenseful novel."
4,Agatha Christie's book is very inspiring,Agatha has a way of writing that makes you want to keep reading. This book is a pageturner because you are not sure who murdurded who. I kept guessing but then the person who I guessed died. I t wasn't who I expected. I would reccomend this book to and kids 11-16 because it was interesting to me and I think other people might enjoy this book as much as I did!
3,good mystery,"when i recieved my summer reading list for the tenth grade i immediatley choose this book because the description sounded exciting and different from the type of books normally given on school lists. after reading the book i descovered that it was suspensful, a good mystery, and told in a good style. i really enjoyed the story of ten people summed to an island by an unknown host. one by one they are killed off, and the remaining begin to suspect everyone else, even the people they trusted in the beginning. i thought it was a great suspense story where you don't figure out the mystery until the last couple of pages."
4,Wromg island name,"A terrific novel with suspense at every turn. But the kindle version calls the island Soldier Island when the correct name is Indian Island, which fits the theme of the book much better."
5,Just get started and your hooked.,"After you get going, this is a really good book. It takes a lot for a book to impress me and this one did. The book starts out with 10 people who all murdered someone. They are all called to Indian Island (an island with a mansion on it) for various reasons. When they arrive they all find out why they are there. One by one they begin getting murdered and the point of the book is trying to figure out who the killer is. You'll start trying to guess who it is and be surprised at the end when you find out who it actually is. This book really got me hooked on Agatha Christie books."
4,And Then There Were None,And Then There Were None is aboout a group of ten people who were invited to Indianisland by someone named Owen. But when they all get there thy are sure that noone has ever met an Owen. One by one they all start to die and the deaths all follow in the order of the poem called 10 little indians. And every time someone dies a china indian figure disapears off the table there were ten but eventually there were none. Who is the killer? Well some of the characters believe that Owen is one of them. But is it true? To find out read this great mystery book and if you enjoy a book you can't put down then this is this is the book for you!!
4,A real page-turner,"This is the first book I have read by Agatha Christie and I can see why it is a classic of the murder mystery genre. Christie managed to make me suspect pretty much all of the characters at some point in the book...brilliantly done! However, like a lot of mystery novels, I'm not sure if there would be a very high re-read value."
3,Mystery novel reviewed by me,"Agatha Christie's novel And Then There Were None, formerly published as ""Ten Little Indians"", goes steadily dull for a while up until the mysterious violence begins.The book begins by describing the numerous characters and how they all are guilty of a crime but were let off the hook.The people invited to an island by an unknown host start to die one by one in strange and unpredictable ways. But when the boat to the mainland doesn't show up the next morning, the several living guests begin to accuse each otherand realize that the deaths aren't accidental.Overall, the story and dialogue is very detailed but the plot line is weak and unrealistic. Although they are numerous, the characters are detailed in depth as though they are being profiled. Seeing that nobody makes a strong attempt to leave the cursed island or create a safe haven makes the story somewhat unbelievable."
3,And Then....,"This book tells a story of ten people who don't know anything about each other, but have one thing in common. That is that they have all commited the same crime, murder. They are all brought to Indian Island to pay for their crimes with their own life. It is very thrilling and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The way the murders go by the poem really adds a great twist to it. I enjoyed reading it"
2,Not Agathas Best,"And Then There Were None was a book that had little interest to me. I love mysteries and trying to solve them along the way, but with this book I soon lost my interest. I have been an Agatha Christie fan for two years now and have to say that I was completely disappointed by the way which this book was written. Not only were there to many characters, but there was also very little description. Which is so unlike Agatha to do. I will continue to be an Agatha fan, but hopefully the next book, which I read will hold my attention a little more."
3,"Decent, but not too awesome","One of the major problems with this book, is that it did not live up to the hype. Supposedly, Agatha Christie is this awesome mystery writer who writes all these amazing books. Granite, the premise of the book is quite interesting. All the murders are based on a children's poem- the order in which they happen and the method. It is a shame that Christie could not deliver on such a surprisingly novel idea.Also, her lack of ""clues"" in a mystery book was disappointing. I would like to try the solve the mystery myself, but since I was given so few clues, I was not able too.The book is not all together a bad book, but its not too good either."
4,Ingenious classic whodunit,"I have found this book listed among the best mystery stories ever writtenTen carefully selected people from different walks of life are lured to spend a few days of vacation in an island off the England coast, and then murdered one after another until then there were none, the murdered understands that these people deserved to be killed due to some actions performed in their pasts. This quick, witty, read, features the classical whodunit structure, explores each person individual fear and the worsening of the relationship between the characters as the murdering process progresses killing one at a time employing different methods. It gives no clue at who might be the killer, who is disclosed in the epilogue"
4,The ultimate Survivor,"Also published as ""Ten Little Indians"", Agatha Christie's classic mystery is still one of my favorites. Ten people come to a remote island, all vaguely invited under false pretenses. With their hosts nowhere to be seen, they have a quiet dinner until a disembodied voice accuses each of them of murder. Of course, everyone claims innocence, but when the guests begin to die one by one, the accusations seem to have some merit. And they can only conclude that there is a true murderer in their midst. This mystery is a fantasy about the art of crime, and is one of Christie's more famous ones. It may not be her best book, but it is quite a delightful tale."
2,Political Correctness gone a muck,"I have multiple copies of this Agatha Christie classic under both titles. My kindle edition has , in the interest of political correctness, changed ""Indian"" to ""Soldier."" This is over the top political correctness. Had I known the kindle edition incorporated the word change I would have one less copy of the book. Give me a break. This is the ultimate insult to one of the great authors of the 20th century."
1,Disappointing Jimmy Stewart Movie,"I dislike saying anything negative about a Jimmy Stewart movie, but...This was one of the worst written, poorly edited, and badly acted movies I've seen in a long time. The story was choppy, incomplete and unbelievable (even for a movie about witches and warlocks!). It was so painful to watch that I stopped it less than 1/2 way through and came back to it the next day, hoping that a good night sleep would make it more palatable. It didn't."
5,Still dynamite,"This is a classic. Just seeing the all-star cast at their best is worth the price. Kim Novak (who never needed any enhancements) Jimmy Stewart, Jack Lemon, Hermoine Gingold, Ernie Kovaks.... all in one package. The quality of the recording is great, and the story is a classic."
3,"Excellent romantic holiday movie, but...","I'm a big fan of Kim Novak (stunning) and Jimmy Steward (even if he is too old for that part!!). I love that film, It's a good holiday movie. But like the DVD version, it's got a lot of grain/noise in the screen and unfortunately, it show more in the blu-ray release (since it,s sharper). I can just conclude that it's NOT a new transfert, but just the same materials that the DVD version... The color are good otherwise... Pyewacket and Kim Novak look great !"
2,Not Like Any Witches I've Ever Known,"Cute. Quaint, even. Is this what people really think witches are like? Is this what they think magic is? James Stewart (not a witch) had the one really true line in the movie: ""Who's to say what magic is?""The premise is an odd one, but I don't think it's completely unique to this story. We are to believe that a witch cannot blush, cannot cry, and will lose all her powers if she falls in love. Well, perhaps there's some truth to that, under certain circumstances. Falling in love with a muggle can definitely mix things up. To me, love is the biggest booga-booga magic of all.But it is disturbing that these witches refer to muggles as ""humans,"" implying, of course, that they are not human.Well, it's a cute little story, and amusing in its way."
5,Great Movie,Great cast and movie plot. Very good for a rainy day and pop corn. Arrived on time and in excellent condition.
3,Pleasant and Nostalgic,"This is a romantic comedy about witches and beatniks in New York City in the 1950's. Not hilarious, but PG charming. Stewart is good as the straight man, and the gorgeous Novak is as good as she can be considering her cool emotional range -- although if you think Sean Connery was too old for his Entrapment costar, you might think the same thing here. Jack Lemmon is my favorite character because of his sly, good-natured quips and stunts. The New York sets, especially in Greenwich Village, are fine depictions of how the city was in the beatnik days."
5,Soulful to the max,Blissful soul with that old uk soul flavour that reminds me of groups like Innocence. Shame they didn't release another album.
2,They use to be absorbent ! What happened?,This is my second or third box of weewee pad. The other boxes worked well and absorbed what it is intended to absorb. This current box is not doing the job. I have to put one on top of the other to hope for absorption.This is very disappointing and a waste of money. Why happened to this one product?
2,four paws wee pads,These were on sale orginal price was 59.95 for 6.25.I thought they would be bigger and thicker.They are very small and hardly worth the sale price the 59.95 as orginal price is a joke they should take that off the ad
2,Poor Quality,"Unfortunately, these pads did not work very well. If my puppy peed near the edge of the pad the urine would not absorb but would run out onto the floor and under the pad. [[ASIN:B002VS6PYE Four Paws Wee Wee Housebreaking Pads 150/Pkg). Will not buy again."
3,Hard to judge,"The idea seems great..but my dog doesn't seem to want to use them to actually relieve herself, only to mark her territory. I usually find dog pee elsewhere in the house, and nothing on the pad, or just a tiny squirt on the pad. Disappointed my boxer girl won't use these."
3,"Economical pricing, but average quality","Pricing is definitely very cheap compared to ""premium"" pads.However pads are very thin, and doesn't control smell.I don't know how well or how much it can soak up liquids since I change them every few hours.Only reason why I gave it 3 stars is because for an economical pad, it is more expensive than other economical brands, and yet it isn't really better to justify the extra costs.It hasn't leaked once for me though.It will get the job done, just not very well done."
2,There are better pads for the same price,I'll keep it short and to the point. I have a 5 lb maltipoo and when my little tiny dog goes pee on the pad it soaks and spreads throughout half the pad. Just from one pee pee then I have to change the pad. They work no better than a less expensive brand here on amazon.
4,Good product for the price.,This wee wee pad is good for absorbing fast and fairly good for odor control. I've tried many brands and have only found one that was slightly better and definately higher priced. I will be ordering this product again. Very good value for the price.
5,Thick and strong,"Of course we all wish our dogs would do their thing outside, but Four Paws is an excellent alternative. They are the thickest and most absorbent I have come across so far."
5,Any package size of Wee Wee Pads,"Any size, any count per package of Wee Wee pads are the BEST on the market !!! Thicker than most, don't tear easily, the larger ones truly ARE larger as specified, great for training that puppy of your with least amount of spills and mess. Best bet in pet pads !!!! C J Hoffman"
1,wee wee pads,"I was extremely disappointed in the product. The pads have very little stuffing in them and I have to use 2 of them on top of each other. By having to use the 2 pads there goes the savings on this product. Next time I have to order, I will probably go elsewhere."
3,wee wee pads,"I think wee wee pads are wonderful!! They've made life so much easier for us since we've had our puppy. He's trained to go on the pad only. However, the ones I have purchased from amazon.com have less filling than the ones I used to get from the store. I'm not sure why this is. They leak through. The pads themselves are wonderful but these ones have very little filing inside. I wonder if they're immitations since the price is so reasonable. I've searched everywhere and this is the cheapest you can buy them $[...] for a 50 pack. Nevertheles, they are very useful and convenient!"
1,Urine rolls off the pads,"These pads are very slow at absorbing urine. When my small dogs (11 and 13 lbs) go in the center area, the urine spreads out into a large circle. If they go near the edge but still on the padded area, the urine simply rolls off the edge of the pad and onto the floor."
2,Poor quality,Pee leaks through plastic! Ended up buying a holder to protect my floors. Not worth the price or shipping price
1,Pee leaks right through pads!,Not much point in using a pee pad that the pee leaks right through... don't buy these and waste your money like I did.
5,Nearly Perfect,"This semi-old school Tribe classic is what first got me into hip-hop. Every song is excellent (except ""Sucka N!gg@"" which I didn't like.) Both Phife and QTip really shine lyrically on this gem of an album. The beats also hit the mark by setting a mood for each song (such as in ""Midnight"" and ""Electronic Relaxation"".) The ""tour guide"" idea was a clever way of inserting some interesting, mildly entertaining tidbits for the first-time-listener. This album is really a must-have for all hip hop fans.The best songs are: Electronic Relaxation, Oh My God, God Lives Through, The Chase Part 2 and We Can Get Down"
5,FOR TRUE HIP HOP HEADS,This is by far the best Tribe Called Quest album. There is not one bad track on the entire thing. It is a MUST HAVE for those true hip hop heads out there. I was diggin' through my throwback CD's and came across my Tribe section and have been bumpin' this particular CD for almost a straight week now.
5,Great Knife at a Great Vale,"I'm new to Spyderco, but have been so impressed with quality that I have now purchased two of these knives. The first one was for me personally to carry with me all the time. It came highly recommended by friends who know a lot about knives. I was so impressed with quality, craftsmanship, and value that I bought a second knife for my dad for Christmas. It's very light weight, I forget it's in my pocket until I need it. I highly recommend it. And the price on Amazon is far less than I've seen elsewhere."
4,its ok,I mean its ok i actually got both i think they cool but i got em cuz nelly made them but these are the worst ones i ever heard from nelly i just hope his future ones are better
2,not as good as nellyville or country grammer,the best song on here is spida man it has the sickest beat and nice lyrics
3,Sweat,"Ok, nothing great. Suit is better, so if you only have enough for one cd, get suit. A couple of good beats and songs, but you will be skipping through most of it. Why did Nelly and Tim Mcgraw have to get togther and make us listen to their crappy ""Over and Over""? Why? Was that really necessary?"
5,YOU GUYS HAVE PROBLEMS IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS CD!!!,"Ok...I must admit that at first...when i went to mtv.com and ""the leak""...i listened to sweat and i didn't really like it...but now that i've boughten this cd IT TOTALLY KICKS ASS!!! My fav. songs would have to be...1)All of the songs except ""spida man"" and ""playa""(well i havent really listened to playa so i guess i havent really given it a chance)I would definitely recommend this cd to everbody out there...but if i did that i'd have to recommend ""Suit"" too so you know what...i will....I RECOMMEND THAT EVERYBODY BUY SWEAT AND SUIT BECUASE THEY ARE BOTH AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Nelly aspira,"Este individuo aspira! Deje esta chatarra sola, Nelly no tiene ningÃºn talento cualesquiera. Hacia fuera lo venden y estos 2 Ã¡lbumes nuevos ambos aspiran totalmente. Si usted tiene gusto de cualquiera de Ã©stos, despuÃ©s mÃ¡tese, porque it's para el mejor."
3,In This Very Room,I liked the different genres of music on this CD. I just felt that sometimes the arrangements were a little weak in the scoring for the piano.
5,MY 2 INDOOR CATS HAVE LOVED THIS FOOD FOR YEARS,My cats are 7 and 8 years old and I have been feeding them this food since they were kittens. I am thankful they were on this when the poisoning happened in pet foods produced using ingredients from China. This was one of the few that was never recalled or caused losses of cherished pets. I did try Blue Buffalo for a couple of bags but the girls did not like it as much and it was very expensive by weight and price compared to Chicken Soup. Ingredients are better I think in Chicken Soup also.
5,Kitty LOVES this!,"My cat was a rescue who came to us from the shelter with another food, one that has a LOT of name recognition and is very widely touted by veterinarians who sell it. When that food was running low, I decided to research things before buying her any more. I'm glad I did my homework! This food (Chicken Soup etc.) was one of the highest-rated dry foods for nutrition on more than one independent website, so I decided to take a chance on it. We just started gradually switching our cat over to this a couple of days ago, and she is already picking around in her bowl to eat these nuggets first, leaving the other stuff behind in her bowl for later. It's too early to tell if she will have behavior changes due to the switch, but it's enough for me to know that she obviously likes this new food better."
5,Electrifying Read!,"For some odd reason, there are not very many books out there on Tesla. This one is all it takes.The way he could visualize an invention with such focus that he could even make changes to it based on how he saw it operating in his mind, without ever fabricating an actual model, was pretty wild. Some of the concepts he was working on almost 100 years ago still cannot be duplicated. Too bad he couldn't channel some of that genius toward his finances.The book has a good mix of his technical inventions as well as the personal aspects of this fascinating inventor's life."
3,Fascinating man,"I had never heard of this individual before reading this book. He was truly a brilliant man who was motivated not by money, but by the longing for discovery.Nikola Tesla contributed much more than just high voltage instruments like the Tesla coil."
4,Interesting,"Interesting book...Tesla was really a genius, on the contrary of Thomas Edison who stole a lot of ideas from this great jugoslavian mind!"
3,Interesting history,Tesla has always interested me. He was a genius and didn't get half the credit due to him. I learned a lot.
2,"Been There, Done That","Yes, you've seen this film before. And yes, that isn't always a bad thing, but here your time is wasted. See ""Ransom"" again if you need a fix. Plot holes populate this movie to the point of frustration, the acting is average, the suspense is minimum, etc. It really doesn't take advantage of its premise. I would have been more interested if it became an intense psychological thriller dealing with the inner workings of this young woman's mind. ""I'll never tell!"" Yeah right, she tells ten minutes later in full deatil."
3,Good Thriller.....,"I found this show was a good thriller. Brittany Murphy does a great job playing a ""disturbed"" girl and Michael Douglas does a good job playing her psychiatrist. Murphy's character pretends to be psychotic in order to remain in mental institutions because there is someone out there that wants something from her..... something that she has in her memory. She finds safety remaining in mental institutions. There is alot of good suspense in this movie like when Douglas' character's daughter is kidnapped being held hostage in return for the secret Murphy has in her memory..... a number. Douglas must then do what it takes to save his daughter and his patient. Good acting, good suspense and overall a movie that keeps you interested. Good movie to rent if you have not seen it before. Worth seeing."
5,Gripping and Entertaining,Dont Say A Word is a excellent movie. All the cast perform extremely well (especially Brittany Murphy and Michael Douglas) and the plot has enough twists and turns to keep you gripped through out (even though the basic plot isnt anything new). Any fan who enjoys thriller's should be more than happy with this superb movie.
2,Don't Say Award,"Maybe it's me---I saw the film on it's day of release, just over two weeks after September 11th., and the film's portrayal of a constantly smoky New York w/ firemen and policemen everywhere made me slightly uneasy. So did Douglas's obviously facelift. Another flaw is a seriously uninvolving subplot involving a policewoman played by Jennifer Esposito. And Oliver Platt's character is forgotten about seventy-five minutes in. But Douglas turns in a decent performance and there are two or so clever or thrilling scenes. All in all, a sub-par effort put on the shoulders of a mega-star."
5,A suspense thriller for adults,"`Don't Say a Word' stars Michael Douglas as Nathan Conrad and Sean Bean as Patrick Koster. Koster is a desperate jewel thief, just released from prison, who kidnaps Conrad's 8-year old daughter Jessie. Conrad is forced to use all his skills as a psychologist to get through to a new catatonic patient (Brittany Murphy) in order to rescue Jessie while running against the clock. This story is full of twists and flashbacks and is action-packed from start to finish. Strong performances from Famke Janssen (Aggie) as the bedridden wife, Jennifer Esposito as the intuitive police detective and Oliver Platt as a fellow psychologist and blackmail victim."
3,Decent Kidnap Story Worth A Look,"Here's another interesting kidnap story. Sean Bean always plays a believable villain and Michael Douglas usually plays roles that keep the audience's attention....so the almost- two hours go by pretty quickly. The whole cast, actually, pretty good with no one person standing out.The story loses points because the ending goes on too long and has the standard villain-holds-the-gun-and-doesn't shoot-too long clichÃ© which drives critics, me included, crazy. That, and a bit too many f-words in here by the female cop (Jennifer Esposito) which simply aren't necessary.A few other credibility holes all reduce this from a sure 4-star to a ""3.....but don't misunderstand: it's worth a look"
2,it hums!,"Alas, it makes a very noticeable hum even when it's OFF! I have to unplug it if I want the noise to stop. Very disappointing.But if size matters to you, it's worth mentioning that it's surprisingly small, especially in comparison to other portable stereos. It is easy to carry and fits anywhere.(edit dec08.2006: and now it's incredibly fickle, frequently interrupting a cd with ""ERR"" or not even playing it at all. i want to replace it, but where are all the red cd players?)"
1,Just Say NO,I should have read the reviews closer myself before buying this....mine just inexplicably quit working after only having it a few months. Dont buy this piece of junk...there is a reason it is priced cheap.
3,coby boombox,"This was purchased for a little kid so I didn't expect much for the price and that's exactly what I got. The radio seems to pick up any and all interference and when it does it's a loud noise that actually scares the kids, makes 'em jump. I tried to explain it's only interference, but they pretty much don't like using the radio now. However, they are enjoying the c.d. for the most part...I hope that part holds up, so far so good. The red color is nice -lol. Basically, you get what you pay for."
5,Works great!,"I bought this a little over 2 years ago and it still works great. It's portable, great sound and does exactly what it needs to. I use the speakers to play my I Pod, and when I just want to listen to my radio it gets great reception. Great price, great value!"
2,"Worked for a about 10 months, then broke.","Bought this about 10 months ago because the price was good, but now the CD player won't work. it sat on a counter and was never moved or abused. If you want a cheap product and don't care if it lasts long, buy this one."
1,Stunningly low quality,"Let me preface by saying I am not the type of person to submit reviews.... However, I felt this one was justified.I read some of the reviews and was skeptical of this CD player, but purchased two of them anyways for each of our daughters. From the first touch of the buttons you could tell this thing was extremely low quality. Both, I repeat BOTH(!), stopped functioning properly after 2-3 uses. You had to press the play/pause button 4-5 times for it to register the function, CDs would not play through their entirety. Incredible. Returned immediately. Don't bother."
1,Get what you pay for :-(,This radio is horrible! The CD player stopped working after 4 months of use and the speakers were constantly fading on it's own!!
2,Colby CX-CD241 Portable CD Player with AM/FM Radio,"It's an alright CD player. I got it because I'd been palying my afternoon music, CDs in my DVD player and tray was getting wore out. So I bought this CD player but soon found out it didn't play burned CDs, CD-Rs and since it didn't I bought one that would and gave this one away."
2,Not loud enough for use in a crowd.,This product works well for personal use. I have tried to use it with a crowd of preschoolers and it is just not loud enough to overcome the noise they make. Other players I have used work better.
1,Don't waste your money,I'm replacing it less than a year later. It won't read CD at all. I'm going to spend more and get something better quality this time (hopefully!).
4,Just what we needed,"It's little, it's portable, and it's cheap...exactly what we needed. No, the sound it not spectacular, but we weren't looking for audiophile quality. My wife wanted a way to take her music with her around the house and even into the backyard, but she didn't want to use an mp3 player with headphones because she may not be able to hear our little daughter. This little player was perfect. It's tiny, lightweight, and round and verges on being cute. And when it's not roaming the house it sits on the bathroom counter and provides shower tunes. And if it dies in a few months, it was cheap enough to replace without much remorse..."
2,touchy CD lid,"We purchased 6 of these for our elementary school classrooms. The trigger that pushes down the sensor that tells the unit when the CD lid is closed seems to be microns too short, and you have to slam down the lid to make this sensor actually sense. Sometimes it will think the lid opens while playing a CD, which is a nuisance. If you need it for the radio, this should do the trick, but if you want to play CD's, you could probably find something better."
1,JUNK,Worked for a week and then started having issues. Stopped altogether after a month. Landfill special now. Bummer.
1,Not worth the MONEY!,Purchased this from amazon on 4/7/11 and the cd player completely stopped working on 6/5/11. Not even 2 months from the date I ordered it! I only purchased it for my son to use at night for his cds. Very unhappy with this product. Called Coby today and they will give me a replacement cd player but I have to send them $10 plus pay for shipping the product back. Not sure if I want to spend more money on this product. Don't buy it!!!!
3,Inexpensive player,"I don't have much expectation for a sub-$20 radio/cd player, but this one is holding up just fine. It gets good reception too"
1,Not Working at ALL........,I bought this item for my wife. She open that box and take it out and kept on her table. Lateron when she wants to use it she turn it on. Noene of the items works. Nor CD or Radio works. I tried to return the items but the return date expire. DO NOT BUY cheap items. DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDon't waste your money
1,"Don't buy this. Cheap, poorly made, will not last.","I bought this because the price was good and it was nice and small, fit on my counter. I used it an average of two times a week to listen to a few chapters of books on CD while I was in the kitchen doing cleaning that would take a while. It lasted from October to April. Now it is too late to return it and the darn thing will not play any CDs, even brand new CDs or CDs that play perfectly well on other CD players. This is cheap and poorly made. What a waste of money."
1,CD player broke the first day,"This CD player is not only cheap in cost, it is cheap in workmanship~ I could play CDs on it for one day. That's it. After that I would have to turn it on, off, it would spin but rarely play. Then, once it would play, it would error out about halfway through the CD. That was such a headache that I finally gave up and I guess the machine gave up to, since it doesn't play any CDs now. The radio is a cheap one but nothing that I didn't expect. It works and I use it sometimes, but gets in very few stations.I tried a variety of CDs, and even brand new ones right out of the packaging. Nothing worked. What a waste of my money. Now I am back on Amazon trying to find another CD player."
3,Who puts the volume on the back side of their electronics?,"We had a cheapo $20 Walmart Memorex CD Player we moved into our 9 month old's room, but recently it stopped playing CDs. Unfortunately I decided to be cheap again and bought this Coby player. While it does work, the volume and tuning wheels are oddly located on the back side of the CD Player. For regular use this might be OK, but we mainly use this at night in the dark and sometimes the volume needs to be adjusted if the radio was used earlier in the day.I would not recommend this to people wanting a low cost radio & CD player for use in their babies room."
2,Makes terrible buzzing sound,"It's easy to use, and my daughter loves having it in her room. However, when there's no music playing, you can very easily hear the sound of electrical wiring buzzing throughout the room. It's an incredibly annoying sound! We decided to buy another CD player that didn't make such a horrible noise."
4,Coby CD player,We had a defective product. It broke after one week & we had to return it to the manufacturer.
1,you get what you pay for,"I bought this to play CDs in the baby room, but that feature broke within a month. It won't recognize that a CD is in. It is now used to listen to NPR occasionally, but the radio reception is not great either. While it was not broken, I enjoyed its portability and small footprint."
1,shrt life span,"I bought one of these for playing CDs. After a month or so of ordinary use, it stopped working. I had made the mistake of buying a second of these Jensen CD players right after purcasing the first one, to give to a friend, but I began using it myself to replace the first, now defunct CD player. In even less than a month it, too, stopped working. The CD plyer will not read the CD. I replaced the trashy Jensens with an equivalent Colby player nearly 4 moths ago and the Colby still works fine. Jensen is now on my ""BEWARE"" list."
1,Lousy.,This is a piece of crap. Don't buy it. The two we've gotten have both had their internal gearing fail. We bought a second because we thought the first was possibly a lemon.
1,low quality,"only a couple of weeks and it's broken - skips and scratches the CDs. also annoying, arrived without power cord. do not buy this products. it's a waste of money! volume doesn't work. radio works. that's it. not even worth 1 star"
3,Good info....but reeks of bitterness and jelousy,"Tuska did a damn fine job researching and writing about the Kid and his 'legend'. Its just a shame that he used much of the book to tear strips off other historians however.His 'Billy and the historians' section reeked of bitterness and jelousy. Tearing into the likes of Robert M. Utley, one of the most admired and respected historians in the field, was disrespectful and unwarrented.Good read though."
4,Biker Scout,"This Review is short because I have already written a review for the same toy (it was in a different packaging, though). This is a pretty simple toy that grants simple joy. There is excellent neck and joint movement. However, be aware that the rotate-joint on the forearm is prone to falling out. It is easily snapped back in, but is annoying at times and can decrease play value. There is only one accessory and that is a very small, easy to lose pistol. It fits snuggly in in a holster on the boot and also is held firmly in the hand. However, it is neither impressive nor cool. Because the gun's handle is so fat, the hand is open very wide and this prevents the scout trooper from holding other weapons such as lightsabers and rifles.Pros:Scout trooperarticulationnifty holsterCons:One accessoryEasy to lose weaponbig hands"
2,Sappy,"Comng from a BSS alum, his is about the sappiest album I have ever heard. If you are looking for inventiveness, goto ""apostles of hustle."" This album makes Pete Yorn look love lost. Snooooooooze. With all the great singer/songwriters out there this is one that will surely be lost in the crowd."
3,Not bad,"The quality of the leather is not that bad, thus I was expecting a softer version. The lenght is too short."
2,Crazy Eights,"I just can not recommend this movie, it's not bad, I just found it to be incredibly boring and formulaic. The cast is really good but they just look bored, and if they were bored making just imagine what kind of fun you're in line for. Nothing of consequence really happens in this movie. There's some blood and off camera kills, nothing special occurs there either. The plot is far from anything new but this movie still could have been something more, an utter disappointment."
3,Genuinely creepy moments so cut it some slack,"I caught this on on-demand Fearnet and wasn't expecting much. However, from the introduction to the final scene, the film held my interest and had some pretty creepy scenes. Worth renting and I'll take this over any of the Saw movies any day of the week."
1,"Dangerous turntable, poor quality overall","The turntable platter is only supported by a center spoke. There are no supports around the edge of the revolving platter. The platter tips and wobbles with all but the lightest items. I was cooking a large bowl of vegetables and when I tried to remove them, the turntable platter and the bowl of hot veggies tipped towards me, the platter itself slid forward out of the microwave, and I got burnt. For this reason alone it is a dangerous item. Also, the dial knob feels like its make out of cheap plastic and could break off without much force. The turning motion of the knob is rough. Spend more and get a better unit - that's my opinion. It's going back to Wal Mart."
1,THE WORST - IT'S FASTER TO USE THE STOVE!!,"I have been using Microwaves since they first came out many many years ago and this is the worst microwave I have ever come across! In most microwaves it took 40 to 50 seconds to warm 10 oz. of milk this would take atleast 2 minutes in this one, Nevermind a frozen meal it might be quicker to get on the highway travel 30 miles and pickup a meal! It doesn't even deserve one star!"
5,Great crate mat for puppy,"Fits the crate perfectly, soft bedding for the puppy. Great product and received in a timely manner. Recommend product and seller."
1,Bad,No information of the publisher is available. Therefore it cannot be quoted or be of any academic use.
4,Walter Lippman's Legacy as I See It,"I had the good fortune to meet Walter Lippman growing up, as my father was his children's orthodontist (overbites all). Through this, Lippman and my biological mother, the receptionist, began an affair that lasted--on and off--for several tumultuous years. While Lippman the intellectual is to be respected, I cannot recommend his book without reservation. I mention this on accout of the extent to which his shenanigans with my biological mother resulted in a great deal of cruelty and psychological trauma to her fragile working-class psyche. If Lippman were around today, I would ask him about this. As I cannot, I am simply leaving this review here so others may read the ""full story."" You cannot judge a book by its cover, but you can judge an author by his actions in the world."
5,Great quick study,"This is a great quick condense version of all the Nclex books out there, you need to use it in conjunction with other NCLEX books. Really helps out in a pinch. Can never have too many to study from until you have that license in your hands."
3,Decent book - many errors,This book is a decent book for those being taking a freshman physics course for non-majors. This is a good supplement to a calculus based physics textbook.
1,"silly, juvenile, implausible","An implausible plot plus weak dialogue makes thisone of Grisham's worst efforts.He gives a rookie lawyer a case that a 14-year-old couldwin, thereby removing any chance for suspense early,then proceeds to fill the book with meaningless drivel.Is he paid by the word? The story did not gain a whiffof speed until the actual courtroom narrative began,about 3/4 of the way through.The dialogue is full of stiff and awkward phrasingthat shows Grisham has no ear for the spoken word."
3,A small man against a big power,I think Grisham never reached (and never will) the level of this first novel.Involving.
2,Make it better next time!,"This is the first Grisham's book I've read. I'm totallysurprised because it's not what I'm expected. The plot isreally slow and the ending is predictable. I don't thinkthat kind of Judge Kipler was exist and we can't expectmore from Rudy.And what a verdict! Please, Grisham. Make it believable!!"
5,A definite page turner,"John Grisham's The Rainmaker keeps you guessing & keepsthe pages turning as you route for the underdog & recentlaw school graduate, Rudy Baylor, as he takes on the one ofthe most revered law firms in Memphis.I didn't expect much - but I think this is John Grisham's finest!I highly recommend it!"
2,The Rainmaker,"I was mildly dissapointed by this book. I was expecting something suspensful, a thriller, at least something that kept your interest. The meandering storyline was bland at best, with very actual storyline. The only half-way interesting part was in the last three chapters. Everything else in the book is basically just a day in the life of a unsuccessful lawyer. I wouldn't recommend this for someone who's looking for a thriller."
3,WTF is up with the pricing,"I would love to review this book, I read about half it on a vacation and when I got home I wanted to finish it. So why is it the advertised price is $9.99 for the book and $11+ for the Kindle version?? And right on the screen I can see an option to buy it new in paperback for THREE dollars! Amazon needs to think about pricing ebooks more honestly."
4,"Book Great, Movie Not So","Rainmaker is a very good novel. Couldn't help but laugh out loud several times throughout. If I didn't know better I would have thought that I knew Mrs. Birdie personally. She certainly reminds me of some people I know. If you read the book before watching the movie you will be very, very disappointed. I was expecting the movie having Matt Damon, Danny DeVito and Danny Glover in it and Francis Ford Coppola directing would have been better than what it was. The book is by far so much better."
4,Great Characters,"This is a great story with great characters! Who wouldn't like to sue an insurance company? Rudy is likable from the first page. He ofen feels like a guppie swimming with sharks, but he holds his own. I enjoyed this story the most of all of Grisham's books."
2,The Rainmaker,"Why do we continue to purchase Grisham's books? My friends and I ask ourselves this question each time one comes out, we pay full price, and then read it--expecting something different than all of his other books. Okay, JG, we get it!!! Please change your formula. I appreciate that you give a lot of money to your Virginia community and am thrilled by what you've done for St. Anne's. I'm glad that you're spending my hard-earned money of doing good for mankind. I loved your earlier books, even your first one, for which you actually apologized!!"
4,Story line,Up to his usual standard even that it was one of the earlier publications. I enjoy that there is no sex or swearing in the story line.
5,Inspired Me to Read His Other Books,This was the first book I had ever read from Mr. Grisham. Rudy as a character was amazing. I could not put this down. The plot is riviting and moving. It made me want to read his other books. I think I'll watch the movie.
5,He did it Once again without a doubt..,This is one of the most interesting story I'd ever read in fiction category. The story is funny and interesting and at the same time easy to follow. I didn't want to putdown the book. John Grisham is once again conquered my fullest attention ..(only few authors has done it before)..I'd recommend this book and other works of his except chamber and run away jury. The chamber is too long and the ending sucked ;) and run away jury..I Only read 150 pges and still don't know where he's going with the story...so I didn't finish it
3,I stopped after the first 100 pages.,"This is the first Grisham novel I have read. The writing style is very good and kept me turning the pages. However, I got to a point around the 100th page where I didn't believe anymore, the magic was gone. For me, the character suddenly fell flat and lost credibility. I couldn't bring my self to finish the book."
4,Rains supreme,One of Grisham's better books. Great story and great characters. A rookie lawyer up against a multi-million dollar insurance company and their well-paid lawyer team.
4,The Rainmaker,There are some great reviews up top so I wont bother to repeat what others have said. This book was great with a lot of humor.The only thing it lacked was a good ending. I found the ending terrible. I dont want to explain why because I would give the whole book away.Conclusion: Rip out the last 20 pages. Grisham should have ended the book in the middle of Chapter 51.DAN
5,"Always there, always durable","I can't actually have a specific review on this product since I don't own it YET, but what I can tell you is that my grandmother who is 85 years young has a Hamilton Beach mixer that she has had since 1940 and it is still going strong today. It is the only mixer she has ever had and refuses to use anything else. This is enough for me to stand behind this product and as soon as I have my the money I plan to have a Hamilton Beach mixer of my own."
2,A Bunch of Euro Trash Wanting to be French.,"Half backed, zanny at times but overall extremely boring for an IB ENGLISH student, I know my expertees are high school and nothing more, I don't recomend this book, if you want to read a book for the beach this one is surely not it."
5,If you love hard metal music,"For anyone who does not appreciate hard metal music this DVD would be a disaster. However, for those who do, this DVD is absolutely superb. Nothing can be more unusual than to see and hear cellos play hard metal music. It is amazing how good that sounds. The wild movements made by the players only add to the high energy presentation. Every lover of hard metal music should have this DVD or any of the other Apocalyptica DVDs in their possession"
3,Good book,"Written in Australian wordage, which left me wondering what they were talking about. Sometimes doesn't give much details, but explains some things better than other books. Good second opinion for other manuals."
2,Useful or Wasteful depending on your needs,"I was going to give this product 1 star, but after seeing some other reviews I think that may be harsh.Personally I will never buy this item again, because I use my highlighters occasionally, not every day. My brand new Post It Flag highlighter stored w/ cap on in a drawer is dead in a few months- completely dried out, while my favorites- the Sharpie Retractable ones- I bought a year or two ago seem like brand new. Now like others I am keeping a useless highlighter for the flags I never got a chance to use.Sounds like it could be a useful item though for students/professionals that have a need to use it daily however. Maybe 3M could make the product better w/a better capping system to keep them from drying out between uses."
1,Shallow and dull,"Bryson has a lazy and sometimes obnoxious style of writing, and the countries he visits in this book all blur together because of it. His perceptive commentaries on the natives can generally be summed up as ""The Swiss, they're so funny!"", ""The Austrians, they're so funny!"", ""The _______, they're so funny!"" He also uses a lot of expletives, apparently thinking this will add humor to his writing. His attempts to tie his travels to an earlier journey as a student are thin at best, and may be nothing more than an attempt to add padding to this small and worthless volume."
3,"Ok, looses steam in the middle","While some parts were funny and he visits many out-of-the-way places, his constant complaining and haughtiness gets old. He complains often about the natives, especially the Germans, and he complains about tourists, especially American (but what is he exactly)? He doesn't speak any other language, except maybe a phrase anyone can learn in a guidebook. Also, not all of his humor is enjoyable, but I'll leave this to individual taste. All in all, I liked reading about foreign places but the book soon became stereotypical, repetitive, and annoying."
5,"Way out of date but delightful and very, very funny","I have read and enjoyed most of Bryson's books. Can't tell you how many times I've read A Short History. I own a couple of his books about words and language and have read one or two that I wish I had kept.Neither Here Nor There is his funniest. Much funnier than Dave Barry, who is nowhere near as funny as his reputation. Sorry, Dave.Bryson copyrighted Neither Here Nor There in 1991. That's 21 years ago. Therefore all the information is totally out of date.But it's delightfully written. I often laughed out loud -- hard.So read it."
1,"Should be called ""Eurpoean Tales of a Bloated Gasbag""","Why did Mr. Bryson write this book? Was it to discourage people from traveling in Europe? He is disappointed at every stop he makes - perhaps had he planned a little better, that would not have been the case. In addition, Mr. Bryson forgets that he is a tourist and that people actually live their lives in the places he visits - they do not live there to accomodate tourists or Mr. Bryson. Do yourself a favor - don't buy this book."
5,"Truly a ""tour"" de force!","I'm not much of a traveller, but this book is one of the most delightful romps I've ever been on. Bryson is not only a very funny guy, he has a keen eye for detail, especially the traits that make us all human in our own particular, regional way. I've already started another Bryson book."
3,Mixed feelings,"I always enjoy reading Bill Bryson's books, but this was a little disappointing. I have the same mixed feelings about the book as he does the places he's describing. He moves around too quickly, and although he seems to have a good ""feel"" for the cities etc. he visits, they are inevitably a bit superficial. Indeed, some of his observations are flawed. For example, he must be joking when he says that, ""the Italians technological contribution to humankind stopped with the pizza oven"". A typical Anglo-Saxon stereotype, and, as it happens wildly inaccurate: the Italians are fine engineers, and....what about Marconi, for example?I also found his (Anglo-Saxon) ""can't (won't) speak the language"" attitude rather irritating. With a little more effort, perhaps he might have done better."
5,the perfect gift 4 one that has backpacked thru europe,"I can't remember the last time I laughed out loud so many times while reading a book. It's fabulous!!! Don't be mislead though, this is not really a book for those BEFORE they go travel in Europe. Rather it is a wonderful book for those that have already been there and want to relive the experience. The perfect gift for a friend that recently returned from backpacking thru Europe!"
5,Very Good Book,"I find this book to be VERY useful to statisticians and non-statisticians alike. Le gives good examples to explain concepts that are often difficult for others to comprehend. Moreover, the author provides SAS codes to assist individuals with the analysis and interpretation of the data. This is a very USEFUL book that is worth purchasing."
4,well done,"This is an underrated film. I and my wife both enjoyed it. Has a good story, keeps your interest and well acted."
3,Good Digital Radio for the Price,"Pros:This is my 4th portable digital radio. I live in a small city. I feel both of its FM and AM receptions are good, especially the AM because of radio's small size. I can find many stations and can lock them easily. I use it while I drive (no radio in my car) and when I walk. The volume is loud enough. I haven't tried its arm band.Cons:1. Its preset station selection button only lets you go upward. With 10 presets each for FM and AM, it may take you a few more pushes to get back to your last preset station.2. The Hold switch protrudes from radio's body, so it's turned to Hold ""accidentally"" quite often in my pocket. Small annoyance.3. One of my favorite AM music stations, only this one, sounds distorted somehow.4. Of course, its earbugs are useless because they keep slipping out my ears.Overall:It's a good digital AM/FM radio for $15."
4,Great radio for the price ^_^,"If you are looking for a cheap FM/AM radio, this is the one.Reception was my most concern when I was shopping for a radio. I received this radio today and it has a pretty decent reception both FM and AM, actually better than my old Sony which I bought for $35 (very disappointed). I live in Oakland, CA and work in Novato, CA. I've tested both places. Since Novato is a bit furture away from San Francisco area, the reception is a bit weak especially when I got inside the building, however, it works great when I tried it in Oakland (which closer to San Francisco) I got pretty good signal from both FM/AM in and outside the building. The head phone that comes w/ the unit is so so. I use my better headphones that I bought awhile back and it sounds great!Overall this radio good if 1. the reception is your major concern 2. you don't want to spend over $20."
4,Good Value,"We bought 25 of these for translation work, Radios work well, headphones are very minimal and tend to break if the cords are wrapped for storage."
4,clear stations,"I use this radio inside a very tall three story building;and I am still able to pick up many many am and fm stations.I did notice that the velcro band is made incorrectly, which was not a big deal to me since I already had an extra one."
1,Horrible Radio,"I just listen to AM Sports Talk radio to and from work. This does not pick up stations well at all. Spend a little more money on something better, you will be happier."
3,Good value for wht you pay,"I was looking for a cheap portable radio for exercising (since ipods don't have AM/FM capabilities) and I found it in this item. It doesn't feel cheap but is still light enough to wear (armband) when running, walking or at the gym."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I was looking for a less expensive radio to pick up AM channels for sporting events and what I ended up with is a very poor product. First the ear buds stopped working, then the whole radio stopped working. It was not worth the box it arrived in."
1,Cheap and it shows.,Radio could not lock on to a very strong FM signal for more than a few seconds at a time. ANY movement broke the signal. Even when the signal was locked on to the reception and volume was not was useable!
3,"Solid blade, everything else not so much...","The blade has held up considerably well. The sheath began to fall apart within the first few days: the zipper broke, the end (at the tip) began to fray and come apart. The sheath was quickly discarded as it became useless. The handles became loose after only a week or so - not even remotely heavy use. Aside from the sheath and the handles, the blade itself has been great."
3,"Haven't field tested it yet, but...","As others mention, the sheath is a little thin, and the strap (I guess for putting around your shoulder) won't stand up long. The stainless steel is quite formidable, but it makes the machete very front-heavy...with a much too small (wood/slippery) handle that doesn't counter-balance the blade portion very well...so your arm will get tired pretty quickly."
1,Horrible,"I have listened to this CD many times trying to find the good in it. I am sorry, but this CD is horrible. Lucinda sounds like she smokes 3 packs a day and the whole CD is her whining. I let my friends listen to the CD to see if it was just me that didn't like it, but they both had the same feeling-what a horrible CD. They suggested I hold a CD burning party and start with this one! I would not recommend this CD in anyway shape or form."
2,Ain't no SWEET OLD WORLD.....,"This CD is representative of why internet downloaded music is so popular. This CD is mostly a departure from her earlier work; fine. But it is not an improvement, or even equal to her earlier works. A couple of good songs (Unsuffer Me, Learning To Live) mixed with some mediocre songs (Are You Alright, Mama You Sweet) and one downright goofy song (Wrap My Head Around That). But what really irritated me was on the song ""Come On""; it starts off as a rough edged rocker, almost like a Neil Young song, but here comes the F*** word. Nice. Sorry Lucinda, I'll buy no more of your CDs. I'll cherry-pick off iTunes."
4,Lucinda Williams c/d,Interesting mix of music--love her raspy voice--but some songs are not much fun to listen to.
3,West by Lucinda Williams,"If you are not a lyric fan or a Lucinda Williams fan, this may not be for you.It is a strange record. Depressing at first then almost liberating.The more you listen, the more you get a grasp on what's going on.It gets under your skin. Not my favorite but a challenge!Just want run of the mill stuff. Don't buy this record.Want to think and feel some stuff, this works."
5,"Learning To Live, Over and Over","A sprawling yet deeply personal piece of American writing - wistful, angry and consolatory in equal measure; aptly titled and performed. The best album of the 00s."
3,OK CD,"The CD is OK but not as good as her earlier CD, Car Wheels On A Gravel Road. After all these years I still find myself humming some of the songs off of that CD. So often performers have a carreer that produces only one really great album. Perhaps once is enough.The songs on ""West"" are OK but are not in the same league with Car Wheels. Her voice, technical skill and the album's production values are all top notch but the tunes and the stories they tell don't seem to be especially moving for me like the songs in ""Car Wheels"" were.Maybe singer/songwriters have to be really hungry, hurt or angry before they can do their best work, who knows."
3,A different cut above,"""West,"" sung by Lucinda Williams, was a very distinctive vocal arrangement of country and rock.Although, in my opinion, the best song on this CD was clearly ""Are You Alright?"" I feel this song hit a higher level and made it a tough act to follow.""Mama You Sweet,"" came in a distant 2nd and the remainder of vocals were good to listen to, but did not register a high approval, in my view.I would recommend this CD because of it's unique sounds and the fact that Lucinda Williams puts a lot of soul in all of her songs.If one prefers western with a blend of rock, then this is your album.Definitely worth purchasing, just to hear ""Are You Alright?"""
4,A Guide to a passionate relationship,"This product is great for anyone. Whether you're already in a great relationhip or whether you feel that there just is no way to save it. Tony Robbins truly helps anyone to focus on their partners and what each individuals basic needs are, which WILL lead to a happy and passionate life for anyone who is in a relationship. It will help you correct the mistakes so many of us make and don't even realize we're making. Truly a must have in any home."
3,An interesting portrait of a soulless creature,"This character, Ryunosuke Tsukue, reminds me of the Vampire Armand, a character created by celebrated writer Anne Rice. Both characters are hopelessly and forever lost, monsters wandering about aimlessly, leaving a trail of death everywhere they go. Ryunosuke Tsukue is a monster because he has no control over his samurai skills: he kills and that's all there is to it, no mercy, no in-between, like a robot. It's a chilling tale, portrayed excellently by Tatsuya Nakadai."
3,"Superbly shot, Shot Storyline","What to say about this movie- As others have written, it is a great movie until the very end. I loved the swordplay and the directing, but the plot was confused, and in the end, brought it down. I would recommend this for the sword fighting, but not for the plot. If you had combined the swordplay here with the plot of Kagemusha, that would be a truly amazing film."
2,Marginal changes in Garmin City Navigator 2010 NA Map Update,"I updated my Garmin Nuvi which had a 2008 NA map using the SD card version, no problems loading. However, I was disappointed to find this map has marginal updates. My home address in a subdivision that is 5+ years old is still not available on the map. Mapquest, Google, even Tomtom all have my street address but not Garmin.Likewise, points of interest that have been around 1 to 2 years were not always found. Again, I checked a 2010 Tomtom GPS and it had the hotels, restaurants I was looking for. With the price of GPS' dropping fast and Garmins lack of most current updates, I probably avoid buying updates from Garmin again."
1,Breaks easily,"I bought this toy along with Mr. Incredible for my son's birthday. He loves the movie and was very excited to get these toys. Unfortanitly, they lasted all of five minutes before Syndromes head fell off, and Mr. Incredibles hand broke off. After that I had to deal with a crying kid. If you want the toy just to look at, then it is good, but if you buy it for your child,don't expect it to last long."
5,Terrific,"Teaching photography I have seen quite a few how-to videos, and this one is the best so far. It is well thought-out and produced. It takes the view point of an amateur photographer (Mom and/or Dad photographing the kids playing various sports), but has many concepts that could just as easily apply to professionals. Equipment wise he does expect a digital SLR with a minimum of a 200mm lens. Sorry no point-and-shoots allowed. Otherwise I would highly recommend this video!"
3,good game for the money,"I think this is a good game. The multiplayer is well done, and after watching the dopey in game movies, it's hard to see why my mom hid this game from me after I bought it when I was 13... level design is a little bit confusing, and playable characters is limited, but it makes up for it in terms of gameplay."
5,Inspirational and Provocative,"In this important work, John Perricone guides his readers through an introspective journey that connects one to his/her mission and challenges them to raise the level of consciousness with which they approach the mission of teaching. I hope that every child in the country has the opportunity to experience a teacher who has read this book and digested it's meaning."
5,Patsy Cline,"I watched a special on channel 11 (WTTW) of Patsy Cline and I didn't realize that all her albums were recorded live. I was curious to hear her, so I purchased the album. What a beautiful voice! I enjoyed the songs on the tracks and highly recommend this album."
3,Enjoyable read. A mammoth of a good story!,"Enjoyable read. The characters were fascinating. I only have two rubs... The mistical transformation into a dire-wolf by the evil dreamer/witch, Catchstraw, and other mysitcal events seem out-of-place in a book filled with beliveable characters and situations. The prologue was interesting yet I was looking for some tie-in at the end of the story such as one of the dead indians in the story being the one discovered in the road cut by the construction workers some 11,000 years later, maybe including some artifact that was part of the story.I will probably read some of the Authors' other works."
3,O.K. for my memories of the play,"This review will not be helpful to anyone but me. I took a memorable girl to see this play. We did not really pay attention to the play. A long time later, I saw this book and decided to see if it was really good. After reading it, I realized that the special part of the evening was the girl and not the play."
5,Life changing book,This book will help you find your inner Pan. A truly fun romp that will change how you see the world. The beard grow rate part is true.
2,hard to take,"Have you ever had someone lend you a book, tell you it's great and that you'll love it, then when you start reading it, you think the lender must really have no idea of your tastes? That was my experience with this book. It was the only book I had with me for 7 weeks in a mud hut in rural Africa and I still couldn't get through it. I felt like I was reading something by a high school student who had just taken a comparative religion course and wanted to show off. Preciously clever, no real character development, club-you-over-the-head pseudo-philosophy, and completely unsubtle sex & innuendo. This was the first Robbins book I've read and it will probably be the last."
2,An exercise in boredom,"While many of ""Jitterbug Perfume""'s characters appear to us on the cusp of major discoveries and decisions, they are typically stuck spinning their wheels, caught in the muck of the author's meandering self-importance and capitulations to barely veiled literary conceits. Amid the baronial flourishes of Robbins' would-be masterpiece, full of its vulgarian panache, its droll boorishness, its self-styled rule-flouting, its delightful miscegenation of puns and philosophy, yes, despite it all, the reader is moved to occasionally snicker, roll her eyes, yawn, or become willing suppliant to the cult of clock watchers to gain egress from the author's intermittent sputters of mental flatulence. In short, Robbins is too enamored of himself, too interested in slaloming through his own cleverness, to meet the demands of this sinuous narrative."
5,His Finest Hour,"This is a very, very special book. Magical, wonderful, absurd, hilarious, touching, inspiring. It's got it all and does it all. Tom Robbins does a masterful job taking the reader inside his world of wonder. I've read this one 3 times and plan to read it a few more. It's that amazing. I even know one couple who read passages from this book to each other on their honeymoon. Needless to say, this book means a lot to a lot of people. Maybe you'll ""get it"" or maybe you won't ... but give it a try and let this novel work its magical spell on you. Alobar and Kudra would expect no less."
3,So what is so special...,"...about this book? Seriously, I'd like to know. Granted, TR regales us with dead-Pan views of Life, Universe and Everything. Yet i find the book unfunny and perhaps even boring. ...it is a sentimental, pretentious sigh of nostalgia by a 60/70ies satyr for the psychedelic highs of the good old times. So retro."
3,KGold,"I like Tom Robbins work...its out there. I love the unique story lines. Very offbeat. It started out fast, a page turner for me, then it turn slow while he developed the characters. I did like the way it all came together at the end. He's a master at weaving plot lines. toward the end, he turned it into his personal soap box to tell us how we need to change our country and slow down the pace of our lives. I did enjoy it and would recommend it for summer reading."
5,The best of one of the best,"This is positively,absolutely, Tom Robbins's best book. I love re-reading it. I don't want to denigrate any of his other books. Every one is an adventure.... and a joy to read. But this book is his best."
1,I HATED IT!!!,ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS... THIS IS THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. THERE IS NO POINT IN WAISTING UR MONEY ON IT... DON'T READ IT!!!!!!
2,I'm so confused,What happened??? I'd finished in about 30 minutes and it was really unsatisfying. The first bit was brilliant but it just went downhill from there!! I mean I still can't figure out whether he was crazy or not. It was a promising story line but the book was just not that good. I don't recommend it. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because Avi is an excellent author.
5,GOOD BOOK!!,Hey this is a book about a guy named Andy who gets a call form a guy named Zeke and Zeke says he killed a girl named Nina but he didn't really then Zeke takes Andy in his car at the end and ties his hands together and take the knife he was supposed to have used on Nina with him! Read the book!!
2,annoying character,usally i like supsene books but this on ei dint care for that much because th eboy was so dumb i mean why would you call so one you thought was a killer and taunt them. it was fast pace and i not sorry i read it beter i think if you want to read a book by avi you should pick a diffrent one.
4,If you arent Justin Bracelin do not read!!,"A couple of things about this book is the phone call that is pretty cool, and what happened during the phone call was a call from a person named Zeak who said,""I just killed someone"". Then he said,"" I killed her with a knife."" ""Who?""said Andy. Then he said... That's all I'm going to tell you about the book, but I'll tell how i liked it. I liked the book alot because, it is a mystery because you will never know what will happen. At the begaining is the best from my point of view. Well that's all bye bye."
3,I'm not sure what to say about this one...,"This was only an average read. I wasn't ""excited"" about anything that happened in this book. Even the seven year old boy didn't seem real. He was WAY too smart and his thought process was obviously through an adult's. I'm sorry, but this boy was NOT real!And don't get me started on Jordan or Joella...How much more boring can a couple be??? Yawn!I gave it three stars because I managed to finish it, and besides the advancedment of Nathan, there wasn't really anything BAD in this book..."
3,Wife No. 19,"Downloaded this book as a friend said it was interesting to read, so far I am finding it a bit slow, hope it picks up."
3,Wife No. 19: The storyof a life in bondage,I thought this book was pretty good. I thought it was pretty repetitive and redundant and i didn't care for the amount of back round the author provided about the origin of Mormonism and polygamy. I thought a lot of it was unnecessary to the plot and even took away from it a bit
4,Buckethead gets ambient,"It's hard to really describe this album to someone. It's hard to describe Buckethead to someone!The album is composed of long, dreamlike ambient sounds, most of which I suspect Buckethead created with his guitar and effects processor. It's either relaxing or terrifying, depending on your mood and perception.To tell the truth, this is a great thing to have on the stereo while you nap. Not too loud. It is like white noise, but interesting in this situation.Really, your best bet is to listen to the tracks on this site."
3,Dreamtorium,This album is different from his other cds that i have purchased so far i really enjoyed track 4 song the other songs were okay.
2,"Spitz takes the wrong perspective, again and again.","The author seems concerned only with Dylan's popular appeal in his analysis of the man's career. For instance, if an album sells well, then it is great. If it does not sell well, then it must be awful. Amazingly, Spitz refers to the brilliant Basement Tapes as ""awful.""His conclusions seem to cast Dylan as a washed-up has-been from about 1976 onward. Of course, this leads Spitz to discount some very good later works, and to generally belittle the many variations of Dylan's career.The only reason this book doesn't get one star is because of the early chapters detailing Dylan's childhood, which were well-written and very interesting."
2,Bad Quality Sound,Bad Quality Sound on the Blue Ray. The production of the disk it's not good. I will not recommend it
2,Not as good as other books,As a total beginner at Genealogy I was looking for a book packed with beginner type info. I purchased this book and the book for dummies. The book for dummies was much better. It gives you lots of web sites to move your search along. This book is very limited and if not for the dummy book I may have just quit.
3,Beautiful yet tangled.,"This yarn knits up just beautifully for a K1 P1 type scarf - so regular and even with lovely color distribution. So why 3 stars? I've had 3 skeins of it and all have been knotted up so bad inside... I spend more time untangling than knitting. My suggestion: before you start your project first unwind then rewind into a ball very carefully, not with a winder!"
1,disappointed,I purchased two of these dolls for my son (age 12) and nephew (age 11) as Christmas presents. The mouths on both dolls did not work properly. You can imagine the disappointment these two boys had on Christmas morning.
4,Straight up.,"It is a blast! In my opinion it is well worth the money.The Cons-I've found these hardly ever come with an instruction manual...and not readily available. Those that I found on the net are in other languages.Also one thing that would make this the ultimate device is a back light. -Lack of one makes it useless in the dark.Distance is limited to about 15 feet (5 meters) and less.Its buttons are small, so if you have big fingers you may find operation hard.The Pros:Its size is relatively small, for what it can deliver.As stated; has a learning function...which is awesome, most any remote- with a function can be learned by this watch...though you are limited to the presets.Great fun! Highly recommended!"
3,Probably worked better on stage,"Some plays translate well to film, and others don't. Glengarry Glen Ross is an example of one that translates beautifully. The Dresser is certainly an interesting film; Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay deliver strong performances, (although they both are over the top) and one does feel the atmosphere of World War II England, but this story simply works better on stage."
3,Go Back to Acting School,Albert Finney was way over the top in this one; forgot one major rule in the arts or anything for that matter--less is more. Could definitely see the engines working--like take a cold shower or something.
5,Damn!,"The music is ragged, rough, and dirty...so it only makes sense that the look of this concert dvd should be too. Incredible, high-energy performance throughout nicely captured here. Jack plays and sings like a man possessed.... Check it out!"
3,Avant-Garde or...?,"The herky-jerky grainy thing really bothers me: Meg looks like a white blob with arms. Even the Beastie Boys' ""Awesome...""--which had many reaching for the Gravol--wasn't as bad as I had been told, given that it took the occasional breather and offered up a clear, well-composed static shot. Rather than being indie, hip, or uncompromising, the visualization approach taken here seems merely lazy and thoughtless. Still waiting for the video collection..."
1,9th day of christmas 2011 review,On the 9th day of christmas 2011 Im going to review...WWF Bashed in the USA. It's just nothing more a filler tape with no real good matches. The ONLY match worth watching is the 40 man battle royal but the rest: No Way. I give this tape a 1 out of 10.
5,"Excellent Symphonic Space Music Including ""Spaceguitars""...","The music you are about to hear on this CD is very spectacular, and highly addictive aswell. To me it sounds like a mix between CHAR-EL's CD ""Heaven & Earth"" and Tangerine Dream at their peak.So if those artists are your thing you will, without a doubt, love the creative works of Jim Pietkivitch aswell. The music ranges with everything from ""pure"" space/new age music to Symphonic rock and a few of the last tracks even has some of the most beautiful and emotional guitarwork you are unlikely to hear on any other New Age CD.I was really swept away by the performance of the songs on this CD, and this is definetely a grower, and also one of the best New Age cd's I have in my collection, next to CHAR-EL's CD's. Why wait? Buy It!Highly Recommended Work!"
1,"Bad Warranty, Great Shredder","I bought this exact shredder a few years ago. It makes the smallest pieces of all the shredders out there back then and today. Unfortunately it is not the most heavy duty shredder and unfortunately one of the metal pieces broke. I called up Fellowes warranty department and was denied. I called to speak to someone else and was denied. They want me to send back the shredder which would cost me a lot and they may or may not replace. They told me that most of the time, they find it ""Is not under warranty."" I am thinking about getting the one at Costco, even though the one at Costco does not cut as small."
3,Too Short's Crew,This album is for those who like the too-short sound. The bass lines are non-complicated and the lyrics are in your face street slang. Too-Short pioneered this style and Ant Banks is continuing the tradition.
2,An inefficient filter,"People buy products like this because they're more rugged than putting a sock over the outlet pipe to filter lint out of the water and keep the sink from getting clogged. The only problem is the mesh is still too large, so lint still clogs the sink."
1,It ended thankfully,"To say the least I was pleased I did not pay for this book. It had inconstancy such as she worried that Plil was so much older when she was willing to marry a old perverted preacher! Another thing I disliked was all he needed to do to be save was say the ""sinner prayer."" Tell me where in the Bible it tells you you will be saved by a ""sinners prayer""? The writting was not that impressive. The character's were forced into their situations. I thought he liked her to fast and was stupid acting. Like I said glad it was a free read. It wasn't even funny. The girl acted like a helpless ten year old."
4,Charming Step Into the Past,"I got this book free on Kindle. I found this to be a charming romance with enough twists in the story line to keep me interested, even though I knew pretty much what was coming next. Reminded me of one of my favorite books, Jane Eyre. Loved learning new words specific to the time period. The main character's love interest is intriguing, passionate and just what you want in a leading man. I was still ready for more when the book ended."
2,Before the Season Ends,"This book was just ""okay""...it kept my interest until about half-way through. Then it went down hill to the end. It was NOT inspirational and far-from-real!!"
5,Addictive!,"Catch up on your sleep later; once you start this one, you won't put it down! I truly enjoyed this romance and the charater's amazing faith. What a lovely book to illustrate how we cannot compromise our faith for love. As always, I learned so much about high society (or the ""ton"")during the Regency period and am reminded how true faith is so often misunderstood. Delightful!"
4,Enjoyable Christian Historical Fiction,"I really enjoyed this book! I had never read anything by this author before and I really liked her writing style.Ariana is sent to stay with her wealthy aunt for ""the season"" and makes her debut into society. Although he is off limits, Ariana cannot deny her attraction and growing feelings for Mr. Mornay. In addition to their differences in social and financial standings, Mr. Mornay does not share her faith in God. As the season goes on, it seems that Mr. Mornay, who never shows interest in any female, is showing unusual attention to Ariana.I felt like the last part of the story drug out a little unnecessarily, but overall, I loved this book and have already ordered the sequel!"
5,Regency At Its Best!,"I am not generally a Regency Inspirational Romance reader, but Linore Rose Burkard has single-handedly changed that with her delightful debut novel, Before the Season Ends. With the delicious flavor of Jane Austin, Ms. Burkard woos the reader with a captivating romance between Arianna Forsythe, a young woman catapulted from her quiet, middle-class existence into the wonderfully overwhelming whirl of her wealthy aunt's high-society world. Here the beguiling innocence of Arianna collides headlong with the cool and self-assured presence of handsome Phillip Mornay, the elusive and dangerous bachelor who wins the heart of every starry-eyed miss throughout London's magical season. What transpires is a deftly woven tale that not only transports the reader to an era brimming with the pomp and splendor of 1800 high society, but a gentle romance that simmers beneath the pages. Kudos to Ms. Burkard for a wonderful debut novel."
3,Wish I could find the other early Alabama albums,"Alabama released Wild Country in 1976, Deuces Wild in 1977, and Alabama Band No3. in 1979. I wish I could find the other 2 albums to purchase, but they don't seem to be available anywhere.Alway, Wild Country is a solid album, but not the place to start. It does not have the polish of their major label debut 'My Home's in Alabama', still its worth getting if you are a fan of that album. The sound quality is okay, good but not great. I probably won't play this CD much, but its worth having for the diehard Alabama fan."
4,Surprisingly interesting,"Since there is almost nothing in either Matrix I or II but special effects (and asinine dialog like ""you will know your purpose when you know your purpose""). Matrix Revisited comes off like Matrix' Greatest Hits.Some may find Keanu in a bathrobe being chased by Max Headroom is entertainment--and to each his own. And I admit watching Lawrence Fishburn imitate Patrick Stewart is funny! But think of the pain if there were no effects in a movie like this. They deserve their own DVD and this is it. Well done."
2,I still haven't read this book...,"So I've managed to put off reading this book for over 3 years. I read the first few pages, and then never got back to it. I kept telling myself that I was going to finish the book and learn the psychology behind my terrible procrastination, but I guess the book doesn't help much if you keep putting off reading it."
2,TOOK FOREVER TO GET HERE,"I ordered this on April 7 and didnt even receieve it until May 7th! thats an entire month later, RIDICULOUS. and I Needed it for a class that i eventually dropped and forgot i even bought the book for.horrible. the book is good though, its pretty standard for anyone in the industry."
3,"it gets the job done, for a student.",Nothing spectacular. Complete and fairly up to date. i would not use it as a professional though and the teache4r could have made a better choice for my money.
1,Product Never received,"Until asked to do a review, I forgot that I had ordered The Traveler's Gift. Recovering from eye surgery, I needed audio books.Some came, but not this one. I'd like a refund please?"
3,Overcoming dreams,"I think that this was a good book. Andy Andrews purpose for this book was to help people who has problems with overcoming failure in their life. I think that if a person was going through the same thing that David was going through they would have understood and became a better person in life. I enjoyed reading the book, but I wasn't really going through the things that David went through. But I can relate to some of the problems. i gave the book 3 stars."
1,The Traveler's Gift,"This book was entirely too predictable!! (Lost your job? Crash your car and go into a coma, everthing will be revealed, and your troubles will be over!). It hard to believe that Andy Andrews knows anything about or has ever experienced hard times. I was disappointed with the ending - after all the inspirational, quaisi-christian rah-rah, feel good 'decisions', finding out that David Ponder winds up as a successful business man is quite a letdown! (I guess money is the only true measure of a man in some circles). Also, the dialoge was very contrived and silly. As my 14 year old nephew said - that book sounds like it was written by Gildoroy Lockhart! If you really want to read a story about hard times (and real people) read 'Nickeled and Dimed in America'."
4,I want to know more!!,"Very easy read that makes you want to learn more and more about each character. I only wish more had gone into the ending. However, I guess you make your own ending. Excellent book to make you think!"
4,Meaningful stories,Enjoyed the stories ... good lessons ... good to give to young people or anyone who needs encouragement or a new outlook.
4,good advice,The book was recc. to me by an older daughter who had the book in her syllabus from a post graduate class. She wanted input on the style and thoughts in the book. I personally liked the book and enjoyed reading it. Won't take very long and it has some excellent quidelines for living life.
3,"Rehashed principals presented in ""new"" format","If you have never read a self-help book and aren't bothered by poetic license in defining historical figures, you will probably enjoy this book a lot. First, the 7 principals can be found in a number of other books. I was like others in being a bit distracted by the license taken in presenting historical characters and situations. I think I would have enjoyed it more if Mr. Ponder had been a silent witness to the actions of the historical figures rather than interacting with them."
1,Disappointing,"This book was a great disappointment. I read it because someone whose opinion I respect liked it. I found it to be the puerile fantasy of someone whose highest ambition is apparently to make a mark for himself by building big fancy buildings. The seven secrets of ""success"" are nothing new. If you find ""the buck stops here"" to be an inspiring revelation, you might want to read the book; that is one of the seven secrets. Success, to the author, apparently means worldly, materialistic success. After positing that David P. was to be the last person privileged to travel through time to gather wisdom for humanity, I expected something of a more spiritual nature. Not only is the message devoid of any originality, but the writing style is pedantic and plodding. If you have trouble sleeping, give this book a try."
5,The Traveler's Gift,"This is an excellent book to keep with you and review often. The information will enhance your life. It is simply written. I believe it should be used as a teaching tool in schools and churches. In the book there are seven historical mentors to the man that has hit bottom financially, spiritually, emotionally and physically. These historical mentors are King Solomon, Harry Truman, Ann Frank, Colonel Chamberlain, Abraham Lincoln and two more that are most inspiring. This book will enhance your life. READ IT!!!Gwen Fritchel - Plano, Texas"
4,good but I but spoiled for me...,"This is a very good book. Very simple yet profound. My trouble is that I heard Andy Andrews speak a few weeks before reading it. He mentioned several items from the book in his talk, which 'stole the thunder' of the book. Only criticism I really have is the ending of the book. Character has a far-fetched future that seems outside the rezlm of possibility for an average Joe."
5,The Traveler's Gift,Andy Andrews is the Will Rogers of our time. He presents thought provoking inspiration with humor and dignity.
1,A total scam,"Sai Baba claims to be a combined incarnation of the Hindu gods Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, and you're not. This is a fraudulant concept menat to enslave others who are under the erroneous concept that there is such a thing as a superior to you ""God"" to Whom you have to subordinate yourself. Total hogwash."
1,Product should be recalled,"The lights go on by itself randomly, waking my daughter up. After doing much research, we changed the code three times which involved taking the fan down. It didn't work, cleary a defective product. We now unscrew the light bulbs, not a great solution! It is a beautiful fan, but certainly not worth the trouble. I will contact Hunter Douglas, they should recall this product!"
3,Unearthed from where?,Another disappointment form the After Dark Horrorfest series. They're not all bad but this is one of the not so great ones. I wouldn't even classify this as a horror flick. Not a keeper.
2,9:00pm 8:00 Central,"Every Saturday night the Sci Fi Channel has a movie at 9, or 8:oopm Central time if you live in Omaha. Unearthed would be a typical Sci Fi Channel Saturday night movie. It is watchable but kind of hokie and a film that you really don't want to pay money to see. This one will be on Sci Fi no doubt in the not too distant future. If you absolutely can't wait, go ahead and rent it. This is not one to buy though for sure. The creature is not very good and the acting isn't much better. The characters have nothing in the way of development. The alcoholic sheriff looks pretty darn young and attractive to be as pathetic a figure as she is supposed to be. And how do you consume that much liquor and still manage to function at that level anyway? Oh well, none of the latest films from the afterdark horrorfest have been that scary so far. I haven't seen them all yet, but ...well, this is about Unearthed. Watch it so you can say you watched it. No other reason."
1,"Watch ""Alien"" instead...","I am an avid horror film follower- this was HORRIBLE! Dragging on & on, and not very scary. The creature looks like an ""Alien"" mated with a mantis. If you're looking to watch this- rent any of the Alien movies instead- they are so much better. Better acting also... I was so bummed out."
2,Attaching to AVG projector,"I was trying to attach my projector to my laptop, the laptop has the connection ports but the only ports in the projector are AVG, I thought this wire was going to work but it didnt. Either im doing it wrong or for some reason this is not working. Can anyone offer some insight into what I can do or would need to hook an AVG projector to my laptop?"
1,Just didn't work,"I purchased this product to use with my laptop, for displaying presentations on a television w/o a projector. Unfortunately, I was not able to get it to work. There was an image, but it was shaky and not clear at all. Changing the image or screen resolution did nothing to solve the problem. Now I have a cord that I basically can't use. Disappointing."
1,Misleading product name--read carefully or get ripped off,This cable does not convert VGA to RCA--what it will do is convert your component (like maybe on a DVD player) output to a VGA input. I feel like I got ripped off here. I wish I had read the other reviews more carefully.
2,Would've been good if only it was placed in a protective cover!,"I recently subscribed to the magazine as a gift for my boyfriend. He's been looking out for it in the mail, when he finally received it, he got the March and April issue already..yay, right? NO!...the ones that he got were all ripped and torn...all the sides of about the first 5 and last 5 pages because they were not in any type of protective cover! So disappointing...I hope that maybe the next ones won't be in such a bad condition."
3,As others say... cheap but gets the job done.,I bought this gauge at a local auto store for about 25 bucks... I wish I had bought it here. Anyways. Installed this unit onto my subaru legacy gt with no problems. The vacuum works good but when I hit boost the gauge rattles at about 11 psi. Well that how much boost I got on my legacy gt at the moment. I hope is not my engine that produces the rattle. So when I get some extra cash for sure I will a better gauge.
2,made in China and it shows,"Not at zero when bought, no adjustment to zero gauge. So I would assume it's reading is also off.10/28/2012, after spending some time with it after my review, I discovered that in the light well, you put pressure on the ""ring"" inside it and adjust the needle's zero position. It now reads zero at power off and displays what I expected to see on my boost (5-7 PSI on my SLK230 Kompressor). It was a -3 at power off when bought, now at 0.I'll upgrade my rating from 1 star to 2 stars, based on quality control, which seems to be lacking.The back-lighting is mild, which I like quite well at that low level."
1,Hope the TV Movie was Better than the Book,"I had high expections about this book, and was looking forward to reading it once I finally got my hands on a copy. OMG - this book sucked so hard I couldn't believe it.I've read some terrible stuff in my time but this sticks out in my mind as truly awful. I disliked nearly all of the characters, Sophie most of all. What a stupid woman. I would have liked to see Alexander paired with someone a little less vapid, and a lot more intelligent and interesting. Ms. Haley can write but her story did not create any interest in this reader. I didn't care what they did, or when and how they did it. I don't know if it was Ms. Haley's intention, but Sophie was portrayed as pretty slutty, imho.I did not bother to finish reading this book - if I had a fireplace I would have burned it."
1,You Don't Need This,Save some money. Crush up an aspirin and add a little water to make an aspirin mask. Saliclyic acid is the key ingredient in aspirin.
4,Great product,"This is the first time I bought a salicylc acid and I wasn't sure what the effect is going to be look like when I put them.It was really hurt when I put them, in the next day my skin was start feeling a little bit also I had a dry skin so I put some olive oil or vitamin E oil on it. but after 3days I can see that some of my acne scar feed out ^^ I will continue this product"
4,"Good product, just follow the instrutions","This is the best anti-acne product that I ever buy, it works just in 1 week, the only thing you have to do is use a cream fro hydration."
2,"Well, not for me...","I put a lot of hope in this product. I didn't expect it to magically eliminate all of the spots that the acnes have left on my face, but I expect a gradual change. In the first month, I did not see clear changes. One disappeared but the other came up. Having read other reviews, I assume it would happen. After 1-2 months, I stopped and started using Origins (serum + moisturizer) and my skin was making much better progress.Last week, I try to combine the together. I used the peel and then put on the correction serum, then moisturizer. Now I have 3 visits from spots, all of them dark and kinda hurt. Assuming Origins was really effective, I have nothing to blame but the peel. I'm not sure if I should continue it or the spots will get worse...Demographics: I'm Asian. A year ago my skin was PERFECT, unblemished and smooth."
2,this's very professional product..,this is NOT lotion or skin..this is Medical product..20% is not low position. 5% and more is very serious to your skin..Carefully consider to use..
4,BE CAREFUL,This product is really great.But BE CAREFULI have been consistently using once a week for about two months now and I still don't use it past a minute and 30 seconds.Rinse with A LOT OF WATERMy skin definitely looks way brighter and clearer with this though :)
1,Definitely NOT ultimate!,"I did not expect all original productions. Unfortunately, you would hear this type of ""ultimate"" megamix at an, empty, second rate night club. I would not recommend this CD to a deaf person."
4,LOVED THIS CD,The songs definetlely had me jumping. It was great to hear some of them that I hadn't heard in a while. You'll enjoy this one.
1,MR.X,"What shall I begin with the extremly bad story line, the unbeliveble characters,how slowly the books events went or the realy stupid ending? I'm 14 years old and our class just finished I Am David and I think it was one of the worst stories I've ever read. One of my many pet peeves about this book is that David seems tho think there are only 3 kinds of people the evil, the stupid and the buetiful he just can't seem to realize that people can change over time and be totally diffrent. I would only recomend this book to people who love drama."
2,I am David review by Sunhoo Park,"I am David is a book about a twelve year old boy who has never been out of concentration camp. A man at the camp helps him escape and provides a bundle of items for him. In the bundle, he has a compass, piece of bread and some advice to go to Denmark. He then makes his way from Bulgaria all the way to Denmark. On his way there, he meets many obstacles that slow him down. Also, on his way there, he does many things for his God. He saves a little girl. Then, he meets a Danish painter who knows his mother. Later on, he meets his mother.What I disliked about this book is that there are too many unbelievable things. Firstly, how in the world does he find his mother? Secondly, what are the chances of the painter being Danish? Thirdly, how does he survive a winter in a barn?I recommend this book to people who like adventures."
4,Historical Family Fare,"This two-part TV movie centers on the creation of the modern games, and how the first U.S. team -- made up of a motley crew of mostly Ivy League athletes -- fared. Although generally accurate, it's told with both heart and humor as adversaries become life-long friends and miscommunications about things such as the weight of the discus result in a much stronger U.S. team than expected.A few athletes from other countries are included, in both heroic and comic light. You also see the Olympic Committee working behind the scenes, such as trying to drum up an audience for the mostly unpublicized event. All in all, it's a interesting and appealing look at a landmark in sports history told by veteran actors and up-and-coming performers at the beginning of their careers."
5,COMPLETE CAST LIST REQUESTED,"YOU DID AN EXCELLENT JOB LISTING ALL OF THE MAJOR PLAYERS IN THE MOVIE. HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT EVERY ACTOR AND ACTRESS INVOLVED IN THE MOVIE AND WHO PLAYED WHAT ROLE. THERE IS A LISTING OF PERFORMERS, BUT NOT EVERYONE HAS THEIR APPOPRIATE CHARACTER LISTED BY THE NAME OF THE PERFORMER. I WOULD PARTICULARLY LIKE TO KNOW THE NAMES OF THE PERFORMERS ASSOCIATED WITH NICOS ZIAGOS (SPIRIDON LOUIS). WHO PLAYED HIS MOTHER, FATHER AND ELENI? INFORMATION APPRECIATED."
5,Athens 1896,This DVD of the 1st modern Olympics since the Original Olympics was excellent. Both my daughter & I saw this movie when it was new & I thought my 15 year old granddaughter would enjoy it . We all enjoyed watching it this time!
5,A very insightful piece of lore.,"This book was recommended to me buy my public speaking professor and when I saw it for cheap on Amazon I did not hesitate to pull the trigger. It's a recollection of Eugene Herrigel a German philosopher who went to Japan to study archery under master Awa Kenzo. However, soon did Eugene realize that he would walk away with a lot more than the knowledge of a bow. It is a thinking man's book that challenges the reader to encrypt the masters message on their own and decide for themselves what it applies too. I greatly recommend this book to anyone interested philosophy, Buddhism, or Japanese culture."
1,This is not a book on kyudo.,"This is not a book on kyudo. As Earl Hartman says in another review, Herrigel did have little contact with kyudo in Japan (3-4 years). This book could be about many interesting things (zen, misticism, ...), but I don't know of them. But it's not a book on Kyudo. It seems more a book on Herrigel himself.I don't says this is the worst book someone can read if is interested on kyudo. Last years saw apearing one or two terrible book's with kyudo in title.Should be read with precaution and specially doesn't substitute pratice and guidance from a teacher or a master. Many persons come to kyudo allready knowing this book but after a few sessions they give up. and many of them continue to claim that they know about kyudo only by reading this book."
2,Lacks Emotion,"This book had a lot of hype but falls short of drawing me into the main characters. It reminds me of the old TV series, ""Dragnet."" Just the facts Maam, just the facts. Malika is moved here, there, suffers this and suffers that..then moves again...Their imprisonment is horrendous but the author goes from fact to fact and doesn't let me into the soul of Malika. I was disappointed."
1,Disliked,"I read the book for a book club. I was disappointed. The story was very self-centered. Also,difficult to believe, but a bit boring."
3,The Long Hard March to Freedom,"Compelling, but very very tiring to relive this horrendous ordeal.Many of my questions remained unanswered at the end of the book.However, I am compelled to read this once more to see if I missed something.Sometimes unbelievable, but I believe the author is true to her beliefs."
4,The Realities of a Desert Jail,Malika Oufkir writes about her life as a princess and a prisoner. She by no means intends this story to be historical. I suppose it is more like a catharsis for what she and her family endured. It is her horrific account of 20 years in captivity where the rule of one man dictates the life of an entire family for 20 years without concern. I am humbled by her courage.
5,Read as a novel ... an absolute favorite!,"Many to whom I have recommended this book found the first half a bit tedious; I found it fascinating. All found the second half ""un-put-downable"". None have been disappointed with the recommendation!"
1,Review of Stolen Lives,"The premise of this book is fascinating, however, that's where it ends. Tragic though the story may be - it is poorly written, choppy in delivery and lacking in evidence of mastery of the craft of writing by the author. It's unfortunate that this potentially riveting story gets in it's own way through simplistic presentation and a meandering unimaginative plot line."
4,Very true and faithful to original movie.,"This story stays very faithful to George A. Ramero's original black and white 'cult' classic. This story is very insightful due to Mr. Andrews explaining how each individual ended up all at the same house. Something that fans of the movie have always wondered about. Good read, worth buying."
1,Hoopla,"Wanted to know what all the hoopla was about... still don't know. Shallow, predictable characters & plot. Plenty of gore. Little suspense. Waste of time."
4,Quite Useful,"I have been taking the Korean martial art Hapkido for close to five years now. In the course of studying, I have found this book's descriptions of techniques and photos quite useful in the learning process. It is not a perfect book and don't expect to learn the martial art from it. However, it has been of use to both myself and my instructors in helping to recall specific techniques in a series and how to execute them. The presence of an instructor can greatly add to the usefulness of this volume as the person can better grasp the techniques described. Therefore, I give it a mostly positive recommendation for those wanting to improve self defense techniques in this particular martial art."
1,Grade: FAIL,"Pointless remake of the 1982 hit made famous by Joan Jett. Spears sings the line ""I love rock and roll"" with all the conviction of a shady car salesman. Production by Rodney Jerkins doesn't help, either. An across-the-board failure."
1,40 Stinks!,This CD is WAY too upbeat for a bedtime CD. The music all has a fast tempo and the singers voices comes over the music was too loud. My child would not sleep! I'm going back to the Celtic Lullaby CD that I was using before. I would not recommend this CD for bedtime.
3,I Ordered Wrong Size,The Product was the wrong size for the LCD Set so I had to return It. It was my error.
5,Simple and Effective,"The price was more than fair for what I received. The stand is very sturdy- my tv is a 50"" Panasonic and it holds just fine. The instructions are a bit tricky, but overall I am very satisfied with what I purchased. Afforadable and better yet, great quality!"
5,excellent product,Excellent quality. Item was as described. Absolutely adjustable (both in mounting configuration and in height). I would reccomend this product highly.
5,So applicable . . .,"Max Lucado always gets to the heart of the message - and the heart of the reader - quickly, humorously and effectively. I highly recommend this book - for a daily devotional or just for uplifting reading."
5,Best of the Arctic,"I've read several highly recomended books about Alaska and the North American Arctic, and Nunaga takes the cake. Pryde writes with compassion and honesty about his work as a fur trader in northern Canada, and his observations and insights are well drawn and articulate. I read this book with some sadness, knowing that the First Nations cultures he wrote about are all but gone, now. And the book took place barely fifty years ago! But his chronicles are worth it, a fast, fun and informative read. Don't be put off by the skanky hook on the back of some older paperbacks: they do this incredible work a shameful disservice."
3,Machine Gun Jublies..how did miss those baby.,"First of all even though at the end of the episodes it says 2006 the animation looks more like 1996. Some of the guys noses look like a poorly formed mans body part. Once you get past that style of anime it is just ok. Most of the episodes are stand alone but the last three tie into the first episode.It is a East Block versus West Block with Androids...enhanced humans with machine gun jublies. There is a bit of blood and some serious language meaning they drop the ""F"" word several times. There is a bit of action as well so it does not drag out.You get 2 DVDs in a Thin Pak, widescreen format and it's a solid 3 star watch but I could not recommend it."
5,just like picture,it was a gift for my gun obsessed brother and he loves it. fits well. really a great vest for the gun lover.
1,not what it showed on the pic,on the pic it showed slots on the side for hose ring clamp there was no slots its just a very very exspensive pair of pliersNOT HAPPY
2,I thought this was based off the book,"I have that has the same name. I can tell you it is in no way the same story.Silly, boring, bad acting, over the top acting and so on.Even though I love silly campy horror I could not give it anything higher than 2 stars."
5,One of my Favorite surviver stories.,"I really enjoyed this movie! It was really an amazing movie, written perfectly I think. The movie had no loose edges, as it was hard to tell what was going to happen next. The twists just kept coming. It was also pretty scary, I remember having to turn down the volume, or just mute it when I knew something was coming! Sometimes it did come, and other times it was just ongoing suspense! You never knew who was going to die, it was a free for all the whole film, which was pretty good as well. I would watch it again in a heartbeat! The acting was also very great! I was there with the characters experiencing the same thing that they were. It was very hills have eyes, in that the victims become the hunters, and the hunters become the hunted. I love that kind of savagery. 5 Starts, would give it 10 if it was possible!"
2,Terrible....,I've seen most of the Horror Fest movies and this one is one of the worst. Don't expect to be scared at all as the cannibals are rather clownish and the main characters/victims are so annoying (thanks to the terrible screenplay) you don't care when they die.The only high point (for me) was seeing Sean from Boy Meets World make an appearance. Haha.
4,helpful for writing your own pattern,This book is a great tool for anyone interested in writing their own patterns and learning different or more complex stitches. Some reviews indicate that this is not helpful for learning to knit. It is basically a dictionary of knitted stitches. Can you learn English from reading the dictionary? That might be tough.I found the book well organized and very useful for combining different techniques and stitches to get a look different from most of the standard knitting patterns I have come across.
3,"Hours and hours of information...nice drawings and pics, too","The only book I've seen of it's kind available in the USA....it is a highly detailed composition from a steam engineer's point of view.....not for the pure beginner...written in the 70's....some knowledge of metal working and model live steam engines helpful.....best part about book shows how to make steam whistles and laying track...however, the deep theory about how steam actually flows and the workings of the pipes inside the boilers was not very clear.....but a good book for hours of reading enjoyment.....worth the price for the serious or junior modeler."
2,well...,"All in all, this was a good book. The general info was very abundant, but the specific information was either sparse or non-existant. For example, he gives a wonderful nomenclature diagram of a locomotive, but when it comes to frames, he doesn't explain how to build them very well or where the critical points are.This is definitely not a good book for a beginner. On the contrary, the chapter on whistles was very good, although still lacking some detail."
4,"Faithful to the original sounds, but sounds better!","I had lost my original copy of TB, so when I saw this, I figured, ""Why not?"" I was not disappointed. I popped it in the CD player and it immediately made me smile, because it wasn't a ""remake,"" ""remix,"" or ""rehash."" It was like hearing the original the way I wished I could have heard it, in full audio glory. The most significant difference, which I don't mind because it also makes me smile, is the use of John Cleese to narrate the ""roll call"" section... sweet! :o) All of the quirky guitar, bass, and synth sounds you remember are here... you just hear *more* of them. The original was sonically groundbreaking in its time... but thank God for modern recording technology! Nicely done, Mike!"
4,"Sounds great, but can't beat the classic","How many time can you redo Tubular Bells? Let me count the ways:1973 - The classic1975 - The orchestral version1980 - The live version (Exposed)1981 - The rare Ray Janos remix (Epic/Virgin PE 34116)1992 - Tubular Bells 2 - lively remake, still love it1998 - Tubular Bells 3 - a sonic dismembermentThe sound quality is muchly improved and indeed Mike did try to keep it to the original as much as possible, even though some of the changes are rather obvious. The use of John Cleese was quite clever but could have been a little louder. I did not like though how the caveman was performed. Adding his sister Sally made it more campy than scary. All in all though, it is a must buy and need to add it to your Mike Oldfield collection. Its good to have Warner bring his music back to the U.S. (about time!)Now Mike, bring us ""Hergest Ridge 2004"" and put an end to the controversy on which version is better."
1,Sending this one back...,"After ordering the CD (but before receiving it) I have found out that this is one of those carrying CSD (Copy protection). I haven't even gotten this yet but the minute I do, I will probably just send it back unopened for a refund. I am not a supporter of copy protection and have also had problems with other protected discs in numerous equipment. In fact owning and iPod and always on the go, everything I buy gets loaded into my iBook or iMac and sync'd to my iPod.I guess my biggest gripe is that the recording industry assumes that anyone trying to import a CD into MP3 format is out to break the 'law' by music sharing... I wonder if sharing my music by letting my friends listen to my iPod and showing them where they can buy a CD for their own is also illeagal...."
4,"Where there's a will there's an ""A"" (audio tapes)","This is as simple as I can put it----I listened to these tapes on my way from TN to GA one afternoon, and by applying the principles I was able to pull my grades out of the ""proverbial sling"" during the very next semester. No joking, it truly saved me, and I did not have to spend a lot of extra time with my homework. It made the work I was already doing much higher in quality. For me, that was the key to succeeding! The information was easy to outline, very clearly presented, based on common sense and supported with research. 10 years after my experience--I am now using the principles in my classroom to teach students how to beat their counterparts at the game of school."
5,Love it!,"It is thin like the previous reviewer said, but I prefer it to the big, bulky pads. It feels comfortable to rest your wrist on and I've never had any problems with the mouse with it.The logo and coloring on it is very nice as well. A decent product for a couple bucks! Overall a great buy!"
5,A very good read.,"This is an excellent novel. From the very beginning Carmen Laforet manages to create a very interesting and convincing atmosphere, the characters are full and the plot does not stagnate. I have read it several times and always enjoyed it."
1,Never read this,Bought this for a class I was taking and ended up dropping the class. Anybody want to buy a book?
1,Waste of money,"they do not taste good, and they do not get warm like it says. I waste my money on this junk again."
3,A Graet Watch but A Wrong Picture,"Hi,I have to say this is a great watch with all the useful functions. I especially love the 3-time-zone function for someone like me who travels a bit and has families oversea. However, I have to agree with a previous review regarding the color of the watch. The color of the watch I receive is totally different from what it is shown on Amazon.com. Honestly, there is only two colors I can tell - sliver and black. There is no purple as far as I can tell."
2,"Inflexible, uncomfortable strap","Ah, Timex! For decades Timex was my go-to watch brand for travel. When I recently needed to replace my trusty ""Expedition"", I looked to Timex. Unfortunately my old favorite watch is no longer made, so I ordered this watch. Perhaps the watch would have worked well, but I'll never know. The strap was so inflexible and uncomfortable that the watch was sent back immediately."
1,Not lilac,"Good morning, I purchased this item for my daughter believing it was lilac or a light purple color. When I got it it was more silver gray - not really purple at all. I returned it and got another one."
2,Old Oil Return Design,"This is a quality Felpro gasket but it does not include the latest design of the oil return hole. You can enlarge the hole at your own risk as rebuilders have been doing for years. Finally, Felpro incorporated the enlarged hole ( which looks like the profile of a Monopoly hotel on its side) into the gasket design, but the gasket set offered here is not the new design. Part number is the same."
2,British bias,I didn't know the details of Richard Bennett's background but it didn't take long for me to know this book is definitely biased toward the British. Bennett appears to think the Irish would have been perfectly happy to remain under British rule had those in charge in Dublin not bungled their 'rule' a bit and had a few ruffians not insisted on pushing for Independence. And wasn't it nasty for those Irish heros to wage their war when the Brits were otherwise occupied elsewhere?!
2,Extremely poor quality,This is a VHSrip-something and not a DVD proper. Quality of the sound is not acceptable and the video could be way better as well.Don't buy it. It's only disappointing.
3,This sponge isn't as large as the original but it works,I work as a professional bartender for a living. I somehow lost the original sponge that came with my Williams Sonoma Stainless Steel salt rimner. This one works okay but is much smaller than the one that came with the unit (which is a standard size). If you aren't picky = this one will work out okay for you but not so much for me.
3,Less is More,"I bought these because they were the only replacement analog sticks i could find. Although they do give you a better feel with the analog stick, i can no longer use my protective case, which really bugs me. i think these would have been better if they had been made a bit smaller, or at least compatable with cases."
1,do not buy i repeat do not buy!!!!!!!!!,this item sucks i got it when i lost the regular one and i put it on the psp but i kept getting stuck up top and i kept having to pause the game take the stick of move it around then put the stick back on every five seconds its hard to use its terrable moving gets me killed playing shooting games online so now i wasted my money and i just have to go with that little nub that holds the stick it hurts my thumb and i cant play games for very long because it hurts so much im getting way less use out of my psp because of it dont buy these get something else
4,Dash,"I bought the entire set of incredibles action figures for my 4 year old son and was very disappointed. However, this Dash action figure held up very well. I would recommend the Dash, Syndrome, and Mr. Incredible, but don't waste your money on the girls (violet & the mom) they are so thin they break easily."
3,Nikki McKibbin is the REAL American Idol,"All the songs are ok, but the only one that stands out the most is Nikki McKibbin's ""Piece Of My Heart."" Sure, it is missing that yell at the end, but it still sounds great. She's got a great future. Nikki is the real American Idol, y'all. She's got amazing eyes, a dazzling killer smile, and a sexy voice. I have one gripe though, her son's name was misspelled in the liner notes.Other noteworthy tracks are Kelly's ""Before Your Love"" which was also released as a single, and Ryan Starr's ""If You Really Love Me."" There are four Stevie Wonder (Stevie-Dub) cover songs on this disc!!! This is a must have for fans of the show. I only gave it three stars because of the other mediocre artists on it. It's really great that there is a skip button on the CD player, that way I can skip those songs!!"
4,A Must for Any Fan!,"Hey there!If you are reading this review I bet you deciding whether or not to buy it and need something to push you one way or the other. Well, in my opinion I think you should buy it! The four songs that Kelly sings are of course amazing! The two the Justin sings are just as good! As for the rest, each song really fits the performer you will have no problem singing along to any of them (as I assume we all will do eventually! LOL!) So my review or suggestion would be to buy it because it is all really good CD! One of my favorites! (And I'm not just saying that!)"
4,More songs!...,"I think that all the finalist should have more songs. Justin gets more songs that Tamyra! And my girls Ryan and Christina get one song! Ryan Starr sang [great] on ""These boots..."" .I think the finalist should get at least 2 each."
5,Trayma Grey,"The ablum was so good i love it. the idols did a great job on it, but my favoitie was Trayma Grey she has a voice to lunach a million radio station and no one can say different you might think different but she has vioce and i think that she should be the American Idol. Next EJay was so great he should have been in the top five and never should have been voted off 9th. Anyway Christina Christian has a amazing vioce and i am sorry that you were sick. Justin your hair is so cute email sometime and i will braid it for you maybe. And R.J you are so cute nice vioce keep it up. And Kelly Clarkson as a nice vioce but it TRAMYA GREY ALL THE WAY!!NUMBER 111111 FAN!! KEEP YOUR HEAD UP, GOD WORKS IN GOOD WAYS AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU GOT AN RECORD DEAL YOU DESERVE IT.!!"
4,Cool set!,"Very good set of figurines, excellent for a birthday cake (which is what we used them for*), perfect size, all-inclusive (nearly every character in the movie is in the box. The only problem I had with this set is they were not painted very well (appeared to be hand-painted very quickly). But then, what do you expect anymore from imported mass-produced products?*The typical birthday cake for the Incredibles that is available only includes a silly little Dash/Mr Incredible toy. My daughter likes ALL the Supers, especially Frozone and Violet, so why leave them out? That was my reason for buying this item! :)"
2,"cheaply made, breaks",The figures are connected to bases so they stand up. But they easily break from the bases and cannot be reconnected. The first one broke within an hour of opening the toy.But my daughter still loved them. I just wish they were a little more well made. you expect more when you buy the name brand and not a cheap imitation.
2,how you can hlep clean up america,This book gives a conservative view on all political issues that face Americans today.
2,cardboard backing beat to hell.,if i was buying this as an unopened display i would be furious. the cardboard is worse than poor. not at all as good as new.
4,Best illustrations out there.,"This whimsical depiction of Goldilocks and the Three Bears doesn't do anything new or innovative with the storyline, but it doesn't have to. Jan Brett's amazingly detailed and intricate pictures will capture your attenion on every page. I found myself going back over and over the pictures, finding more little details each time. Something that Mom and Dad can enjoy right along with the kids."
5,Pure Energy!,"This really blew me away. I understand so much more about the energy vibrations & why I used to feel so scrambled. Doing the exercises taught in these tapes made an incredible difference in my life. This should be taught to every child so they can grow up healthy, strong & protected. And every adult needs this to release stress & feel the flow of pure energy. It shows lots of different exercises for all types of ailments. If you already sense subtle energies, you will truly be amazed. If not, keep an open mind, practice & hang in there, it's worth it."
5,In This Mountain (Mitford),Book was in excellent condition and received prior to 9/7/05. Met my expectations.
4,Latest Mitford book,"I was a bit disappointed in this novel--don't know if it has been so long since the last one or what, but I felt like this was very choppy, the way the story jumped from one passage to the next. I had a hard time reading it, and have so looked forward to another Mitford visit. The characters are all there, and the examination of Fr Tim's struggle with retirement, depression, health and most importantly, his faith was outstanding and very well done. It was just hard to jump from one thing to the next. Really these books are a good exposure to Christian faith and values, and really want to make you think about it all. I remember thinking there were to be 7 books total, but this leaves off making you think there will be one more book, as there is still a Barlowe brother to be found, and that appears to be the mission of Fr. Tim--reuniting the Barlowe children. All in all, this will not disappoint Mitford fans, just be forwarned that it did not seem to ""flow"" as the ones in the past."
2,In This Mountain,"I shop only for unabridged books on CD. When I received this item, it was an abridged version and was not what I thought I had ordered. The item did come quickley and packaged well, but it was not what I was expecting. I did not notice that it was unabridged right away, or I would have sent it back. That part was my own fault. But I just never thought to look at that.Mary Rivas"
5,Bringin' it on home,"When a guitar player hears Mississippi John Hurt's playing athey are generally struck by the simple beauty of it. To master the Hurt style is quite complex, but this book with its combined CD's (which feature MJH himself!) offer a good roadmap for unlocking the style of this master. Definitely not for the beginner, but one great feature is the way the tablature is presented. It is large and easy to read. To me, this makes a world of difference when attempting to learn a new piece using tablature."
1,Mastering PHP 5.0 (5 Disc Value Pack),Mastering PHP 5.0 (5 Disc Value Pack) is the worst buy of my life. I thought this was the worst setup and e-learning course I have ever had. I have taken over 6 e-learning classes so I know what I'm talking about! 1 star!
5,A Real Gift from Hayley,If you like Hayley -- you'll really like this album. Her voice is so distinctive and so clear that even if you don't like the song you will enjoy her singing. It's hard to come up with adjectives to praise her talents because they have all been used so many times. I keep this CD loaded in my car at all times. //
3,Tagine - seasoning?,Just got a tagine. Noticed comments about seasoning the tagine before using it. How do you do this?
5,Happy :),"I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas. The delivery driver must be a basketball fan. The nicely packed box was launched over our gate and landed in the middle of the driveway. As you might expect, the bottom was broken. I called the seller and the response was ""of course we will replace the broken piece at no charge to you"". No problem, no worries, just taken care of. I was also asked to measure the bottom in several places to make sure that the new one would fit correctly. It arrived today and fits perfectly. Thanks for the great service! I researched this product and also purchased a diffuser and cookbook to complete the gift. The diffuser is a ""must have"" if you want your tagine to last."
4,Campbell provides a suspense thriller for Missile Defense,"John T. Campbell did it again, he continues to provide excitement and special unique twists in his writing. He makes it an easy read for the non-technical reader providing a clear picture with his 30 years of knowledge in the Aerospace Industry. I highly recommend reading his Illustrated Guide to the Desert War weapons used in the new conflict with Iraq as well as all of his other books, Raid on Truman, Sub Zero, and Cobra Dane. I feel Vauclain's Shield should be required reading by our service men especially at the Pentagon and those working for the Department of Defense. It is a great suspense thriller with a wonderful surprise."
1,No thanks,"Not interested in the extensive issues this disk brings into our home and the continous fear that someone might inadvertantly put it in to the primary music system we have ... our computer.Plus, what chance does this have of running acceptably on future versions (or patches) of Windows?They hope to sell us another ""fixed"" version for that.If they are so concerned about piracy, the BEST form available is to take the original and bury it under 100' of concrete. Don't sell it, don't make it readily available. Don't even record it!Problems solved for everyone."
1,>>>>>>>>> SAVE YOUR MONEY <<<<<<<<<<<<<.It's a cash-in-CD.,"The effort is C - . However the album should have not been made.Old ,terrible,annoying music which might appeal to some hysterical fans,only.....This what you call a "" Christmas Cash-in- record "".And what about the price,my goodness? A collection of old material at $ over 20.00 bucks !! PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY![...]"
3,Nothing special,"I love Celine, but this album isn't as good in terms of quality as most of her earlier releases (I mean, dating back to the 1990s).Except for the new recordings included ('Je Ne Vous Oublie Pas,' etc.), most of the songs are taken from her older French albums. Some have said that this was a lovable rehash of her entire French discography, but I just didn't get into this one as much as I wanted to. I guess I need to let it grow on me.A better album from her in French isS'Il Suffisait d'Aimer (If It Is Enough to Love)."
4,"A little heady, but a good book on the subject","I'd been looking around for a fairly comprehensive work on Playng Card history, and found this a pretty good choice. A bit wordy and heady at times, but covers things well."
3,Great Pitcher But Parts Not Up To Scratch,"I received this quickly enough and as an old Brita user, can only say I'm pleased with the jug at least. But the refill reminder was broken and wouldn't start (Brita will replace the entire lid assembly as a result) plus the enclosed filter was damaged with carbon granules leaking all over the place and had to be tossed in the garbage. Luckily I had replacement filters on hand.So wherever this had been stored I don't know but someone, somewhere had either badly mishandled it or perhaps it was a returned item and wasn't inspected thoroughly before being resold?"
2,Lid does not fit,The lid will not fit. If forced in place it pops off once pressure is relieved. It doesn't make sense in this day and age of advanced injection molding for something to not fit. I still use it but I have to take care when handling and keep my thumb on the lid to hold it in place.I threw it away. I couldn't get the inner part out to change the filter. I tried gently prying along the seam with a butter knife which broke the plastic and sent a small piece into my eye. No damage to my eye but it ticked me off so in the garbage it went.
4,I Like This Alot,"I ordered the Brita Grand 80-Ounce Water Filtration Pitcher in purple about a month ago, and I really like it. I drink a lot of water throughout the day and this pitchers holds a great amount for that. I also LOVE the purple color, it's really nice and bright. The only reason I didn't give this product 5 stars was because at times the lid can come off a little to easy. Iv'e never had a problem while pouring from the pitcher, like some have commented before. I had a problem while filling the water. You push on the top of the lid and for some reason my lid always comes off when I do this. other than that i would recommend this product for anyone who is looking for an easy and affordable way to drink filtered water!"
4,a little color on these things is always nice,"looks cute in my fridge. does what they all do - filters nicely.even has a little sensor that tells you when to switch out that filter (though i haven't paid much attention to it yet...)anyway, i would recommend this. we need more color in our lives. :-)"
1,USELESS!!!,"Bought this (not at Amazon) because I needed to replace a very old Brita pitcher that I had (and loved) for many years.I didn't research this purchase too heavily (because I'd never had an issue with Brita before) but I wish I had. This thing is just awful! The small 'flip up' lid falls off EVERY time we use it and the larger lid has to be held down when we pour. The filter can process about 1/2 a pitcher full of water but if we refill the filtration chamber once the first 1/2 pitcher is done, it won't filter at all, and if you try to pour off the filtered water to make room for the water in the filtration chamber, it all leaks out around the insert...mixing filtered and unfiltered water together.In short...USELESS!"
4,Happy to be using a brita,"I am very pleased with the brita pitcher that I purchased through Amazon.com The water always has a fresh clean taste that makes me want to drink water more often.The only complain that I have about the brita pitcher is that the lid does not snap into place like I thought it would. I was disappointed that it did not fit more securely onto the brita pitcher, however it has not really created a problem so far."
1,BREAKS!,"I think that the water pitcher is not only confusing (my room mates and I had the top on the wrong way!) but it also needs to not break when we drop it. We are college kids who are clumsy, thirsty when drunk, low on counter space, and poor. So we should be able to balance the pitcher on our leg while jumping across the room and if it just so happens to fall, it shouldn't shatter. Thank you."
1,Poor Design Falls Apart,"I really wish I had seen the reviews before I purchased this.1. Top does not fit properly. I have had a rubberband on it almost since buying it to keep the lid on.2. It's only been a month and the handle had become detached and I can't get it to snap back on.3. Don't overfill it or it water will shoot out the back all over you and the floor.4. I love the capacity, however it takes two times to fill it up and then it's too heavy for smaller children to lift and pour themselves. (The later being more of a personal observation instead of a flaw.)"
4,I like it,It's great having filtered water ready and waiting for me. My only complaint is that the area where you fill is so slow to filter and only holds about 1/2 a pitcher.. so I fill it when it gets to the 1/2 way mark. It feels like I'm always filling the pitcher.
1,"piece of garbage, don't buy","This is a piece of garbage, the top green portion was in so tight we could not get it out, numerous people tried, we put it in the freezer thinking the cold would shrink it, we tried to put olive oil down the sides, NOTHING WOULD BUDGE THAT GREEN PIECE OF PLASTIC! So we got some pliers and started to pull, CRACK, it broke into two pieces, into the trash, we were all so angry at that point! I read the reviews saying buyers were dumb and didn't put the thing together right, we never had a chance to take it apart to put it together right, the green piece was just way tight and would not budge. I hope others don't buy it, ths is the only way they will learn not to mass produce garbage. (And no, I didn't want to repack the broken pieces, trot to the post office, then fight and explain that it wasn't my fault it was broken to get a refund, my time is money.)"
2,Lid Falls off,"I bought this because Brita has such a good reputation, and it was an extremely attractive product. However, the lid is very poorly designed, and frequently falls off during use. Everyone in my family has had problems with this. I never had an earlier version of the Brita, but I wish there was an alternative, because the lid issue is a real nuisance."
1,How hard can it be?,"I have 2 brita water filters in my home. Both of them leak after i fill them and then pour water. They have hollow handles which for some reason get water in them, then when pour the water it leaks out of the hollow handle. My floors are wood and tile, they become damaged or they become slippery when wet. How hard can it be to design a water filter bottle that doesn't leak? Too hard for Brita apparently. Still they are major provider of these type products. I hope they improve or someone else enters the space and designs something better."
1,Does Not Filter Anything!,"I've been using the Brita water filter pitcher for almost a year now--since we moved into our new home with well water that tested high for nitrates. I recently got an under-the-sink filtration system, and I went ahead and ordered a TDS meter.Our well water from the faucet tested at 440 PPM.The well water that was filtered from the Brita pitcher with new filter tested at 420 PPM.Since we went ahead and installed our under-the-sink system, our water from that system tests at a mere 40 PPM.Don't waste your money purchasing this $30 filter pitcher with $20 refills of filters. If you seriously want clean water, choose something else."
4,Good filter,"Easy to use and water is 100% better than it was, not a trace of the chloriney taste we had previously. It doesn't seem to hold much though, and we are only a 2 person family. If I was buying again I would probably get the dispenser. (This one is handy if you are filling a kettle from it a lot though.)"
3,Not my favorite,"Enjoyable, but not my favorite book in this series. I have to laugh at some of the crazy situations Goldy finds herself in. Her husband, Tom, was not a central part of this storyline and I wished there was more interaction between them. I love that this series has recipes included in the book. I am going to try the Chocolate cookie recipe and the Killer Pancakes from this book!"
3,richie woolfolk is better than David at basketball (mlms),this book was not very good because i dont think it makes sense. Lennie gets killed at the end cause he kills curleys wife. So Geroge kills Lennie so he can be the one to kill him.Also i wouldnt reccomed this book to anybody else cause its confusing and i just dont like it cause its boring. All it talks about is lennie and George so therefore i hate this book.Ya-Ya
3,Love the look but...,We originally installed 3 in our kitchen they came with halogen but now xenon they get pretty hot and we have had to replace 2 of them in 8 years but they look great.
3,"Great idea, Doesn't hold","I saw these and purchased them immediately, it was a great idea for a spice rack! However, I've had it for approximately 5 months and the sticky have almost all come off so I have half my spices up, the others fallen off. They are pretty cheap, so it's not a big deal to order another set or purchase stickies for, but just be aware they will fall off."
1,Not worth it,"The spice rack organizers look great and seem to work initially; however the double stick tape does not stick for very long, and then the whole thing falls down."
1,They keep falling.,I had a set of these before....but they were obviously not the same brand. These keep falling off the wall. I am not impressed!!
1,do not buy,"I thought O how great I can organize my spices. Man I was wrong. I waited forever for them to come in stock so I could buy them. Once you stick them on, it doest take long and the entire strip falls off. Plus the plastic clip that is supposed to hold your spice losses its form and will not hold the spice. If the spice is in a glass jar and is very heavy it just slides right out of the hold and knocks other spices off with it. It was a total fail. I bought several strips. I did not even donate the extras I tossed them in the trash."
2,poor door spice rack,the racks do not stay glued to the door they must be screwed on but once this is done you will find that the bottles will fall off there not enough tension on the holders
5,roomsaver,this rack does save a bunch of room in the cabinet. You just have to be careful what it holds doesn't run into the shelving in the cabinet.
5,Love these!,This is a very neat way to store my most used spices without taking up counter or shelf space near my stove.
5,Loves these,"These do just as they say. I have had no problem with them falling off or losing their stickiness. If you use a wider jar on them, it will stretch the plastic out so a smaller width one will not be as tight in there. But it is no problem if you use the same spots. Love this product!"
4,Amazing...,"These things are amazing...I just installed a set...My kitchen is old and had no organization for spices...They don't look like a lot of money...But put all the spices up there. A bit tricky to install so they don't get blocked by the shelf. Just ordered 3 more sets directly from the manufacturer. Going to use in the bathroom, under sink and to hold broom and mop in place."
2,everything but the shortest bottles fell off,This did not even last 3 weeks. I am very disappointed because I was excited about it and still love the idea of it. Only the shortest bottles shown in the listing picture stayed up. All others fell out one by one after about the first week. By week three the holders peeled off the cabinet door and I gave up!
1,Good in theory,"This is good in theory, but after only 2 days of being on my cabinet, they started falling off. I am very disappointed."
4,awesome spice racks,They were so easy to put up... love them. We are actually using them for medicine bottles.. I have several different meds so this helps out in storage.
1,Not Worth Buying,"Product does not hold its shape. Once plastic ""arms"" are stretched to fit one spice bottle, another of a different size (if at all smaller) will not stay secured - it falls out. However, the tape to hold the plastic ""arms"" is very strong - it was hard to remove before I threw the product away and chalked it up to ""buyer beware"" experience!!"
4,Good book,"I wish it had more detail on some of the subjects covered. More detailed exaples would be nice in its content, it would help drive iin the material. needs more examples."
5,"Clear explanations, relevant examples - great introductory-level book","This book is written in a very clear and easy-to-follow way. The author does not assume a lot of knowledge on the part of the reader, and gives plenty of clear, relevant examples to make sure that the subject is fully understood. This is a great introductory book on transistors. I particularly appreciated the inclusion of actual datasheets and the use of them in exercises. In the real world, I use datasheets all the time, so it was helpful to know what to look for.The book is probably too simplistic for anyone who already has had a class on the subject. My experience with books by Floyd is fairly consistent - he is generally clear and easy to understand, but the tradeoff is that the books often lack the depth and complexity explored by other authors.If you buy this book, be sure you are aware which version you are getting - it comes in both ""electron-flow"" and ""conventional current"" versions, and it WILL make a difference to you."
1,Electronic Devices,I'm an electronics student with a teacher that doesn't have a clue how to teach and seems to know little about electronics. That means I have to rely on the textbook. This is the 2nd book by this author that I've had to use with this teacher. DO NOT GET THIS BOOK IF YOU'RE IN THE SAME SITUATION. Floyd seems to think we students already know what he's talking about. He also loves to refer to diagrams in the text then hides them elsewhere (not on the same page). I HATE THIS GUYS BOOKS!!!!!!!
2,good for beginner but not well for studing,"In my first studing the subject of electronic , my teacher decide to using its, and the grade is E in the end term . its not a good news for me and depression in my heart . In the strain , i do my best to read this, but i deed don't know what's is BJT CMOS pnp npn and what the DC current differents the AC current .the resistance how to work , and how to compute the stand side by side or in the string .i don't like this book so the rate of this book is 2 starsi know its right .i recommand the mircoelectronic ( sedra/smith) 4th and millman mircoelectronic (2nd 1989) its a bible for electronic which i thinking ."
5,Excellent product,Product met all expectations and is a wonderful addition to my electronic music devices. Highly recommended!
4,i-shuffle,"Bought this i-shuffle for a 76 year old man about to undergo chemo treatments. Holds lots of music and easy to download either from the webor your own cd's.He is using it often, even at home when he connected itto his own Bose radio.I will upgrade to one with a screen for him (so hecan see the titles) if he continues to use this as much as he is now.Very happy with this purchase."
3,Not that good,It's my first and last Apple product. I'm moving to a Zune player. Much more rich in features.
5,AWESOME,"LOVE THIS LITTLE GADGET....ITS THE BEST I USE IT ON MY WALKS, WHILE SEWING OR WHATEVER I AM DOING ITS TINY, GREAT FANTASTIC SOUND AND TOUGH FOR A LITTLE ONE.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SITE FOR ITS FAST SHIPMENTS, AND ITS QUICK ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONSSO GO SHOPPING!!!"
3,charging ipod,I would have liked to have known that you have to charge the unit through your computer.
3,shuffle,It was very difficult to down load properly. I had to call for support twice before I figured out how to get to a live person.
3,i pod shuffle,it's worth the money i spent for it. it does the trick for what in need it for. first i-pod.
1,DOES NOT WORK,"I bought this item for my wife so she can listen to music at work because she loses things and this was cheaper than a big new iPod. When I got the item it looked ok but it diddnt even come with a charge cord, how do you do anything without a charge cord. I looked past that because I had a spare one. The iPod would charge but would not sync to iTunes or to the laptop so we tried resetting it, using 3 different computers, two different charge cords, and updating iTunes. NOTHING worked so the item is crap and I am very dissatisfied with my purchase and I discourage anyone from buying from this seller."
1,BAD IPOD,Not only did I purchase the IPOD Shuffle but paid fpr shipping. It did not work and now I have to pay to ship the thing back? Not great service and really bad product. Won't be doing this again.
1,Shuffle arrived broken,"I love the Apple Shuffle! Unfortunately, it arrived in a crushed box and would not hold a charge. I was so disappointed"
4,More love than hate,I love- the design- the ease of use- the weight- to clip it everywhere- the size- the qualityI hate- that there is no display- the iTunes software restrictions- that it is still expensive
3,Darlene's Review,"The ear plug connection to the iPod itself is not a tight fit. When you walk, run, or go to adjust your volume you get static due to the connection not being a good fit. This is my second order on this device. The first one I returned was even worse."
2,IPOD Shuffle,"For the price I paid, I could have gotton one at Walmart for $10 more, brand new. The one from Amazon (O$CAR) did not come with headphones or a docking station, and was dented in. The Ipod came in the mail by its shipping date. I had to go to the store to purchase headphones and a docking station separately for another $28. I couldn't get the Ipod to upload music from my computer. I became frustrated, wrote an irate email to the seller, and found a similar item on Craigslist for $35, with headphones and docking station, which has performed perfrectly. I returned the items I purchased that did not come with the Ipod I bought from Amazon to offset the cost of the device, I have been reluctant to make any further purchases from Amazon."
2,not what i expected,"this product was so small, doesn't work with other ipods accessories. I wish I would not have gotten this produc at all.........Go to store for th amount of money you spend on this product"
1,PIECE OF JUNK,"I had heard rummors about the proprietary nature of the IPOD family but never understood it completely. Now I do. this is not a plug and play device like every other MP3 player i've ever bought. This device will only work if you install Apple's ITunes software on your computer. you cannot drag and drop songs, nor can Media player see it as a device. Definately going back to the store."
5,tiny and amazing,"no fussing with any other features ,just music !!! no usb port on unit ... small belt clip is great. product is awesome highly recommend"
4,"Overall worth reading, practicing","Short spin-off on the Feldenkrais method. I particularly enjoyed the explanation on the red and green light reflexes. And how traumas cause stored, compensatory tensions in the body.The lessons were completely doable and not too difficult to follow. I recommend ""The Busy Person's Guide to Easier Movement"" for much more comprehensive Feldenkrais exercises.The problem is that the author has it out for modern medicine. And seems to go too far fetched with the idea that aging doesn't have to happen. He should've emphasized that with better use of self, aging potentially can be only a fraction of how limiting it is. It's not that a person doesn't age and weaken at all."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I returned this book within two days of its purchase. A large portion of this book deals with the author's discussion of success stories. It is then followed by a substantive discussion and then a chapter on exercises. The exercises are impossible to understand as the author has employed the use of a wooden art class figurine to illustrate poses. The photographs of this wooden model do not have enough contrast to serve as illustrations and are thus totally useless. Buy Yoga, Mind Body Sprit by Donna Fahri for a much better explanation of body mehanics and with higher production values."
5,WONDERFUL!!,These batteries are a great value when purchased in bulk! Way cheaper than even Wal-mart!!
5,A recommendation that I love,"Very good CD. Great sound, I didn't know one song on the album before I bought it, but now I like them all."
2,I wanted to like this album.,"I really tried to like this album, but could not get over the feeling that I was reading my 8th grade brother's diary about his trip to California. The entire lyrical content can be summed up by the words sun, California, LA, and Boston. There is nothing new or interesting here, don't waste your money."
2,Beware of Reg. 2,"I was excited to view Beloved Infidel.But when I received it, I found out that this was a Reg. 2 DVD. . .which meant that I could not play it on my Blu-Ray.I had to return the DVD."
4,80's R&B (sometimes) at it's best,"The good cuts on this album are very good; Come into My Life, It's Love that makes a woman but All-n-all is one of if not the classic 80's post disco dance cut. The UK remix is powerful. Anyone who doesn't like this one has no soul and definitely cannot dance. It's pure energy and power. The horns are tremondous. How anyone can hear this one and not jump out of their seat is beyond me. The rest of the album is average to above average at best.Still a must for any 80's R&B fan."
5,good debut,"A good debut with the extended version of Come into my life and her hits All in all & Lifetime love. It has a touch of freestyle and breakdance but is not out of fashion, if you listen to it today. She's a bit like the 80s Alicia Keys. One wonders why her fame faded."
5,"Awesome CD, Bring her back!","Such a fun, moody mix of dance, R & B, and pop from the eighties, which still holds up well today. A multi-talented performer and songwriter. A must own for dance collecters, and I highly reccommend it for everyone else too! I'd love to hear something new from Joyce!"
2,Boring. slow,"I bought basically, because I love Denisee Richards and Daryl Hanna, plus I like also Valerie Tasso, besides I am a fan of Pierre Woodman, they all appear on the film, among some well know adult stars like Dora Venter, Rita Faltoyano. But really the film is not good at all, it is slow, the elements don't match. It is sometimes hard to follow. It is really not worth buying it."
3,Docu-moviementary of Prostitution,"A combo of live interviews with real life ""Pro""s and a movie within a movie of 2 women, one already deep in the business (DH), and another who needs money to help for school (hottie ex-Mrs Sheen Denise Richards).Its entertaining enough and educational enough to show you what the life is like for this profession. Go into this, not to see T&A; but to learn about what they do between servicing clients, and you will certain like the movie. But looking for gratuitus nudity? Get Showgirls instead."
1,Terrible product!!!!,"The price was great and that is exactly why I bought it. But, I got just what I paid for!!! It worked great for the first 2 weeks and then it was downhill from there. The volume turns down on it's own! I would lose all of the music on the player for no reason and finally the thing just died after about a month. The company was great and gave me a new player to replace the original piece of crap I bought. They didn't give me a hard time or didn't question me at all. I was very pleased with that.I still have the replacement and it's been at least a year. It works good except for I don't get sound into both ear pieces of my headphones unless I push the headphone slot to the side and it works. Anyways, this product is not worth the money. spend a little more money and get a good product."
5,"More, more! I want more from Beth Moore!","I'm always scared to try new authors. You either love them or hate them. But when you've read through most of the big names and you need new material, you venture out.I'm glad I did for this book. I don't think I've EVER read a more romantic book in any genre. The author takes her time building up the two characters relationships. Their romance is verbal and physical, hot and sexy all at once. The situations they find themselves in are new and interesting. It's not your usual banter either.I highly, highly recommend this book. I hope Beth Moore writes s'more."
4,Good and Effective,"I've relied on a glucasomine/MSM combo for years but tired of taking three huge pills. Jarrow is a good company that makes superior supplements. These pills are large but one pill contains 1000 mg. I used this product in connection with back pain and must say I am impressed with its effectiveness. I do take it in conjunction with glucasomine. I've never suffered from any side effects.If you have chronic joint or back pain, it is worth trying. I am impressed although the pills are a bit ungainly."
2,Appropriate for those very short attention spans,"It saddens me to review this book that is nominally associated with Esquire. Having followed Equire's mission to educate men in sartorial style--not fashion--over several decades, I could not help wonder whether this book is a reflection on mens' loss of attention span or that of the authors. First, the pluses: the book is short (nominally, 152 pages; given the white space, about 65); reads quickly (if it takes you over an hour, you fell asleep); and wit (""Shaving does not require so much foam that your face resembles a meringue pie""). The minuses: zero historical context and questionable advise; e.g., [Re rings] ""Silver or platinum or white gold, not yellow gold""(One cannot be well dressed wearing a gold wedding band?). In sum, buy this for a prepubescent youngster (male or female) who is doubtless preoccupied with sex and not clothes, a very short attention span being the requisite reader attribute."
2,Good Band Just not True grass,I saw this band in concert opening up for George Jones last year and I rushed out and bought the cd only to be disappointed. On their cd they don't play the same energetic truegrass that they did in their show. I reccomend buying one of their older albums instead of this one. This Album is far too watered down for a true bluegrass fan's taste.
4,Impressed already,"I opened the box and was instanly inpressed by the craftsmanship of the bag... this is my first. I bought it beacasue I needed to have some water with me while i ride my dirt bike on trials and somewhere to carry light equipment (camera, cell, mp3 player, tools etc). I havnt tested it out yet but from the looks of it I made the right purchase. The bag itself is light and just the right size to fit on your back comfortably. it has alot of compartments for whatever you need. Fancy but rugged enough to take the stress. All the straps are adjustable easily for your preference."
5,THIS CD IS HOTT!,"hey, this is a pop Gospel cd U GOTTA OWN! YA HEARD this cd is cool i luv it from the thing i got it i luv the song Forgiven Get it It's HOTT!!"
5,Inner Child Work,"My girlfriend gave this to me for helping me with inner child work. I absolutely love this C.D., It makes me feel free, and when I play it, my 14 month old comes running to me, because it's our ""Happy Music"" and it means, ""Let's Dance""."
4,"Easy to clean, nice looking",This is a pricey-toilet seat but it delivered on stain resistance which was the most important feature for me. Easy to install. Easy to clean. It's also a pretty comfortable seat.
5,Awesome,"This CD is absolutely wonderful. I guess it helps that ""Hanging by a Moment"" is my boyfriend's and my song, but it's not just that song that makes the CD. The WHOLE CD is really good. The group has great sound and excellent song lyrics. I higly recommend buying this CD!"
5,Better than the single,"""Hanging by the moment"" is a pretty good song, but the other ones on this cd are even better! I bought it, put it the stereo, and it didn't leave there for weeks! ""Sick Cycle Carousel"" has great acoustics, and ""Breathing"" is hands down the absolute BEST track of all. I love it! ""Somebody Else's Song"" is one that I can listen to over and over again simply because I feel better knowing that someone else feels what I feel. It's raw emotion. ""Trying"" reminds me a lot of Jars of Clay, so if you are into bands like that (or Jack Johnson, Dave Matthews Band, Train, Goo Goo Dolls, REM, Creed's softer stuff, etc.)you'll enjoy it. So if you like good alternative music, get the cd. It has lyrics anyone can connect to, and the music itself is contageous. It's one of my favorites."
5,I love this CD,"I can't believe I haven't burned a hole through it by now. Lifehouse has a great, mellow sound that I absolutely adore. Plus, they are great in concert. I totally recommend this CD to anyone who likes their song ""Hanging by a Moment."""
5,Awesome!,"This is one of those CDs that you buy for the single and as it turns out that every other song on it is even better. There's and overall acoustic sound, something you can kickback and zone out to. I was biased since I had automatically fell in love with ""Hanging by a Moment."" But I was even more impressed by the other tracks, like ""Cling and Clatter"" and ""Everything"". Hopefully this CD catches like wildfire and Lifehouse makes it big and become immortalized forever. So help them! If you like mellow sounds and meaningful lyrics...you won't be disapointed...so come on...trust me...buy it...you know you wanna..."
5,Every single song...,"on this CD is amazing. Lifehouse is really one of the most talented bands out there and should be heard by everyone. I love bands that write beautiful, heartfelt songs and this is one of them. No Name Face is just an utterly amazing piece of work and I really cannot say anything else without sitting here for days. Everyone must purchase this album. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."
3,Came on time,Worship. Purchased the CD for the Everything Lifehouse skit. Came on time and was what I expected.
5,This CD is a MUST!,"I first heard of Lifehouse from my friend who raved about their debut song ""Hanging By A Moment"" and I later found out that the Matchbox Twenty concert I was going to, Lifehouse was openning for them! So I finally saw the music video for ""Hanging"" and I could not get over how good it was. At the concert I was mesmorized by their singing and the next day I went out and bought the CD. Since then I have listened to the entire CD everyday and I still love it more and more everytime I hear the songs. When you are having one of those bad days, listening to their music really lifts your spirits and makes you feel a lot better. It makes you aware that you aren't the only one going through the things that you are, and it really lends out a helping hand. Lifehouse's music is inspirational and I don't know what I would do if I never bought this CD and if I never knew who Lifehouse was. BUY THIS CD!"
4,Dis Ain't No One Hit Wonder!,"Like many people, I first became interested in Lifehouse after hearing their massive hit 'Hanging By A Moment.' If you're afraid that you're buying just that one song by buying the entire album--don't be! There is not a weak track on this album. Besides the biggie, my favorites are ""Sick Cycle Carousel,"" ""Simon,"" ""Breathing,"" ""Quasimodo,"" ""Somewhere In Between,"" and ""Everything."" BUY IT. TRUST ME."
5,Truly a Gem!,"I recently discovered Lifehouse and I am so glad I did. The band is great in so many ways. The songs on this CD are so powerful and meaningful. The lyrics are so well written and the songs are so real. Music doesn't always have to be loud and upbeat to be powerful and moving. This CD proves it. I hold this album very close to my heart, I wish more people would recognize what an awesome band Lifehouse is."
5,It Will Move You,"This must be one of the greatest CD's I've ever listened too...it's that good! My friend told me about them right after the CD came out when someone bought it for him. After getting myself a copy, I was blown away. There is not one bad song on this CD. Every song sounds perfect and you can connect with them on so many levels, both spiritually and emotionally. I've played this CD for almost everyone I know and not one person has told me they don't like it. The best song on the CD if I was forced to choose would have to be ""Breathing."" The lyrics blow me away every time I hear them. Another standout song is ""Everything,"" an awesome song to close the album with. It is so moving and so touching...you have to listen to it for yourself. You will not be dissapointed with this one. It's an instant classic!"
5,GREAT!!,"You should definetly get this album if you dont have it already and while your at it but they brand new release Stanley Climbfall, both equally amazing!!"
3,"Another Rock Band, But With Some Talent","Although Lifehouse has erupted into the music scene with ""Hanging by a Moment"" they still have a ways to go with their overall performance. Although songs like ""Breathing"" and ""Hanging by a Moment"" are hits and make an impact on the music world Lifehouse needs to develope their abilities. In my opinion No Name Face is a great first album for this band, and definately worth getting. It will be nice to see this band's second album when it is released, and what they will come up with next."
5,FOR MY LADIES,"This review is for my ladies!!! Im not a real big gangsta rap fan but this CD is strictly a must. There are a few tracks for the ladies, and if you like music and artists that dont make a career off one hits this is your CD. I listen to this CD straight through."
4,"INCREDIBLE KICKBOXING ACTION IN ""THE STRIKE""","""THE STRIKE"" is a martial arts movie full of INCREDIBLE kickboxing action and plenty of foxy babes! Two of the stand-outs are Stephanie Sinclair, who has a VERY revealing shower scene, and Autumn Vena, who plays a herion-addicted hooker in an Asian gangster's private bordello. Some of the fighting is this movie is especially vicious, so basically there's never a dull moment! Catch it - you won't be sorry!"
3,Cherokee Primer,"At first I thought that this was an overly simplified version of the history of the Cherokee people and I didn't like it. It is simple but it was also published in 1961. Looking back at the time(1961), this was probably a very good introduction particularly because it was so short. Today I would want to see a more expanded version particlarly if it was written by a Cherokee scholar. I am hopeful that the Cherokee people are revitalizing their heritage and will share their culture with a world desperately in need of courage, forgiving and guidance."
3,O.K.,Decent watch for the money.Controls are not very user friendly and instructions are a joke.Dont think I would buy one again.
3,About what I expected,"Each of the Op-Center books has presented a crisis based on the current events and global political circumstances at the time of its writing. This one isn't different. The prospect of terrorists obtaining and using nuclear material is daunting, and the job of preventing such a disaster even more so. This book isn't quite as gripping as some of the earlier books in the series, but it did present a few surprises, and it wrapped up the story nicely. This book placed some of the Op-Center staff in new roles in the field, which was refreshing, and it introduced at least one new character that I suspect will return in future volumes. This was a fun, light read, perfect for any fan of espionage/political thrillers."
1,Jesus and Elohim; Are They the Same God?,"The points this book tries to bring up can be more so asked about the differences between Jesus and Elohim.this book asks; ""how it is possible that we see a total contradiction in the message of the Bible and the message of the Quran?""The fact is that Jesus contradicted Elohim on the laws of divorce, sabbath, defense, dealing with adultery, parents, food, etc...This book also ignores that the momentous 10 Commandments from Elohim are reaffirmed in the Quran while they are abolished in the NT, you can't get more contradictory than that. Elohim punished millions of people in the OT for not following the 10 Commandments, now this book wants to tell us they never mattered?Allah is more similar to Elohim than Jesus ever was, yet this author time and time again displays a grave lack of knowledge of all three Testaments.John B"
3,Why?,"The only thing that I got out of this book what that Joey Stefano broke the glass celing in the porn world for being a bottom. It is his life story but it is just the same: A troubled kid with a drug, sex, and alcohol problem. I would have like to have read a store where he turned his life around and made an impact. I dont recommend this book."
3,Not a Biography You'll See on A&E,"The reason I got this book was that it was a biography of a performer who's movies I was once thrilled to watch. Joey Stafano wasn't particularly intelligent but he loved sex and, from this Isherwood biography, wanted to be a porn star from a very early age.Isherwood has a very fluent and visual writing style that makes for easy reading, but there really isn't much to read about. As one reviewer pointed out the author makes it a point to tell the audience that Stefano was private and didn't discuss his youth, so instead of investigating and researching and interviewing those who were a part of his pre-L.A. history, he tells us stories from those Stefano had told stories to. So, to fill in the pages we get miniature biographies of Chi Chi LaRue and various roommates and porn stars and drag queens who were, in some way of another, connected to Stefano.So, three stars...because Isherwood is a very talented writer, but not talented enough to overcome a thin story."
4,Pretty tunes Teresa style.,"This is a nice album of ballads with strings. No Ricochet Romances here! Ms. Brewer handles the classic torch songs with restraint and the lush arrangements by Dick Jacobs are somewhat reminiscent of Gordon Jenkins. ""Lady in Satin"" it's not, but a lovely album overall, and not typical Teresa Brewer fare."
5,Trendy Sport Watch,"I bought this watch because it was inexpensive and had an alarm. It continues to be my favorite watch.I wondered if the band would hold up to wear and tear. It has held up well showing little wear or dirt.I bought it in blue and it matches many colors surprisingly well. It keeps perfect time, the alarm is reliable and I get compliments on how it looks. It is not like the usual alarm sport watch that is bulky and ugly.I have even forgotten to change it and even had it on with dress clothes. Any other sport watch I would have taken off and hidden away but I wore this one anyway.This watch is a great bargain."
2,"watch is good, band is horrible!","I got this watch for Christmas 2011 and was excited because the band was material, not plasctic. Much to my surprise, the band is not 100% material. Rather is is cloth fibers stuck onto a plastic band. I have had this watch for 1.5 months and only wear it on the weekend and the band is already fraying at the edge. It is scratchy and difficult to put on because not only has the material frayed, so has the plastic that the material is attached to making the edge sharp and causing it to catch on the loop. The watch itself does the job, but I would stay away from this band. Of course the watch has a 1 year warranty, but guess what, the band is not part of the warranty. Looks like I will have to go find a new watch band."
1,PIECE OF GARBAGE,"This is the worst watch I ever bought. I am so disappointed in it. It's a piece of junk, and I wish I'd never wasted the money on it. DO NOT INVEST IN THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE!@!!"
4,nice value,"I am pleased with this watch. It is inexpensive, yet has a lot of features. The only negative is that the band is a cloth material and not as easy to keep clean as it would with a leather band."
4,"Balance issues, defective canopy","This model is a lot of fun, but requires patience as it it very detailed. One of the drawbacks is that when fully assembled the rear portion of the plane is heavier than the front and the model tips on its tail. I solved this by filling the nose with weight. In addition my canopy is defective so I am waiting for the seller to reply with a solution."
5,The American Diesel Locomotive,This book gives history and interesting facts with color illustrations; a very good choice. All American manafactures covered. I always enjoy my copy finding new information i missed the last reading.
5,"Finally, A Return to Their Punk Roots","I have to start out saying that I have been a hardcore Blink fan sine they released Buddha several years ago. And along with the other true fans, I was very disgusted when they were being labeled as pop because they were on MTV and 10 year old girls became fans during the Enema of The State phase. Well, I think its safe to say that time is over. This album is fa edgier then Enema, and is in my opinion right up there with Dude Ranch as their best. I like/love evry song on this cd, and the bonus tracks are hilarious. So anyone who was a fan during the earlier punk years, buy this cd. I promise you won't regret it."
3,BLINK IS DARN GOOD,i_SPENT_THE_ BEST_MONEY_ON_THIS.BLINK_HAS_MADE_MY_YEAR_HAPPY..i_HAVE_SPENT_MONEY_ON_ TOO_CD'S_AND_CAME_OUT_REGRETTING_IT._I_AM_DAMN_PROUD_OF_BLINK._FINALLY_ MONEY_ SPENT_ WELL.
1,these guys are awful,"They call themselves a punk band, i ll tell you why they are not.-Their lyrics are idiotic and don't defy anything at all.-Their maturity level leaves so much to desire.-THEY USED LITTLE PEOPLE TO PROMOTE THEIR LAME MUSIC ON MTV!!!!! That goes against all that IS punk, making fun of those people is immoral and a disgusting publicity stunt.-They have Beverly Hills mansions.I think that's enough, go get some real punk like Dead Kennedys, Subhumans, Crass, Rudimentary Peni or Citizen Fish."
4,"Pretty good, but not exactly what I expected","Take off your pants and jacket was REALLY good. The songs were fun and enjoyable to listen to. Though, I think there has been a small change in the type of music Blink has done since their other C.D, Enema of the State. Otherwise it was really good. The one thing i'm glad about is that Mark hoppus sung more of the songs. The bonus tracks were dumb but very amusing! I can gurantee anyone would like this CD."
4,Hmmm...,"This basically was a good album. Not one of their greatest, but you can still listen to it. The guitar and bass riffs remind me of Dude Ranch, well most of them anyway. The overall tone of this album is more serious (i.e. Anthem Part 2) than their last real album (Enema of the State) and reminds you of some of the earlier songs from Blink, lyric wise. But I fealt that there wasn't a lot of effort put in this album.So overall, this is a good album. You should buy it if you're just curious about new Blink songs, but for everyone else that really liked some of their earlier songs, you probably wouldn't like this."
2,Blink and Pop,"Most of the album is typical Blink 182 with songs about getting with girls, and breaking up with girls. This is basically just pop-rock (punk if your offended) and nothing more.The album does have it's share of DUDS in ""Reckless Abandon"", which is annoying as [heck], and ""Every Time I Look For You"" which sounds like a filler. ""Story Of A Lonely Guy"" has a great chorus and music but the stupidest lyrics. If you want something that sounds all their other albums, and just want something to make you smile, go ahead and buy this.But if your looking for real rock, definetly avoid Blink 182.Hoped this review helped you. If not, I'll try better next time."
5,shut up,I realy LOVE this c.d...I think that all of the songs are awesome except for first date which is extremeley cheesy.my personal favorite is track 14.I have no idea what it`s called but it`s on the red album.umm I guess thats it.Bye!
3,They're going soft on me,"This album had a few good songs. once you heard rock show 10 or 20 times it got really old. I do like stay together for the kids. The only real big problem with this album is that they're going soft. They used to be more punkish when cheshire came outbut it all went down hill from dude ranch. They tried to be really funny in this album but in their "" old age"" they've just gotten dumber. I haven't asked my neighbor to borrow it and I've borrwed all the others. They need to shape or ship out and get back to their punk roots."
4,"yeah, good dirty pop-punk","i was one of those who stopped listening to blink all together after 'dude ranch' because of the whole ""sell-out"" thing. I just couldn't stand everyone from idiodic gap skaters who loved ""new found glory"" and the ""Ataris"" to ""princess-shirt"" wearing girls listening to the same music as me. But lately while delivering pizzas i've been playing blink rather constantly and i've found that they share a place in my heart. this album is a dirty dirty gem. long live midgets, long live blink 182"
5,Great CD -- even better than Enema I think,"I didn't think Blink 182 could top their last release Enema of the State; that was a near-perfect punk confection with one of the best songs of all time ""What's My Age Again?"". Being a person hardly partial to anything beyond the Top 40 dial (with a few exceptions: a la Blink 182) I found that 2001's Take Off Your Pants & Jacket was even better than Blink's Enema of the State. Not only was it a more consistent release but it had better songs. Sure, none (""First Date"" and ""Rock Show"" aside) of the CD's tracks were nearly as memorable or fun as ""What's My Age Again?"", but from the opening ""Anthem Pt. 2"" through its conclusionary ""Please Take Me Home"" Take Off Your Pants & Jacket is a pop/punk piece of great ass! Blink 182 may not have matured any (a la ""Happy Holidays, You Bastard""), but they certainly know how to put out fun music. Get this CD, folks, you won't be disappointed."
4,This is a great CD!,"When I first bought this CD I thought it was going to be like their old CD, kind of rock but not really. I was blown away by their lyrics and rhythm that they had, but didn't have in the first CD. I would definately recommend this to people who just wanna rock out and have some fun."
2,Fun but..........,"....it's a little weak. Lonely Guy and ""Happy holidays"" are good but the rest of the CD is 30 year olds whining about high school angst. Grow up, it gets old. Listen to Antiflag, Nofx or Bad Religion."
1,Horrible Pop Slop,"Throwaway, immature lyrics, the same stale power chord riff recycled 13 different ways, and horribly juvenile sexual jokes from three 30-somethings with children. Download ""Stay Together For the Kids,"" and buy their latest album, and beyond that, forget blink-182 even exists. They're not worth remembering. Oh, and before you click 'not helpful,' know that I do appreciate the genre of pop-punk. I enjoy New Found Glory, The Offspring, NoFX, and some of Simple Plan. But this is STILL horrible."
1,Could this suck any more?,"Could this album and this band be any worse? How simple-minded do you have to be to even consider this or any Blink album music? It isn't music. It's repetitive, meaningless, boring, one-dimesnional crap that every dumb 12 year old kid with a skateboard thinks is the anthem of their generation. What a lame generation. If this is the crap that passes for art these days, will someone please shoot me?"
2,Before there was G@y Charlotte there was Blink 182,"Thats right! This is the album that started all of the crap-a$$ poseur punk that rules MTV, VH1 and the radio now. I hate Mark and Tom, they are probably two of the most talentless musicians you can find, they both cant sing for s***, Tom cant make quality riffs and Mark cant even follow with some good basslines. The only talent in the whole band is Travis Barker, he's the reason why I'm not going to give this one star. But not even Travis can redeem this band for being so terrible so until a revolution in the music world takes place (like Nirvana and Van Halen) then we're going to have to put up with talentless bands like G@y Charlotte, S*!tty Plan, Avril Lavigne, New Found G@*ness, very little talent bands like Blink 182, poseur rap like Eminem, bubble gum pop divas who think they're Madonna and very crappy non-poseur rap. I hope something happens very, very soon."
4,"Sure, buy it!","Yeah, yeah, it's pretty good; it's got a couple good songs (rock show, anthem part two, first date) but besides ""Rock show"", it doesn't have any outstanding songs like enema of the state did. It's pretty good, but I would (and did) only buy it if it's on a discount price."
2,Blink 182 is Back(street)?,"After the initial Enema dissapointment, I decided to give these popsters another try. It turned out to be a waste. The songs have a softer, more refined edge, and there are backup vocals in just the right places. Sounds good, right? No, this album is boring and trite. The songs are repitious, and the content was obviously selected to please the lowest common denominator of the human population. Just because this music is faster and there is more profanity than most pop, does not classify it as punk."
5,Bonus tracks?,"The Blink album is great. Every track is worth a listen. I have a question... My cd has the 3 symbols, no yellow or green version. And i don't have bonus tracks. Does anyone know what the deal is with this?"
3,Not Quite There,"Blink 182's music and the band itself are not quite there. Their music is repetitive with the same old rifts and beats. The music is a fast-paced, immature, undeveloped, pop/punk nightmare. Although I do have to give them credit on setting the standards and for being one of the pioneers of a great genre. Blink's songs can be very cool to listen to, once in a while. But their music is just like them, young."
1,Kill The Bonus Tracks,"They really turned out trash this time, Enema was great this soundS like Enema with junk for lyrics. Also they made the huge mistake of including a totaly imature bonus track. Don't get me wrong I like Blink 182, I have 3 of their CDs but this is one I don't want, there out of material and just want to act ""cool"" infront of 6th grade girls, that means swear more then sounds sane, and have lyrics totaly about love and romance (what yong girls thing the worlds about). To turn a review back on itself If sombody has a brain I don't understand how they can blindly follow these guys into paying money for recycled music? its gota be a girl thing...*joke* If Blink 182 would look at there reviews here (a smart thing to do) GO BACK TO THE OLD STUFF FOR REAL IT WAS GOLD!"
1,wut the this band is bad,"ok this band is pop punk. it really wouldn't cut the cheese if the sex pistols,ramones,the clash, or misfits where still big. to start off this album ruined punk by trying to make complex songs with like 100 chord eep it simple like 4 or 5. 3 would be awesome. Second stop thinking about girls and deal with the government. I like green day better than these guys they have a variety of topics these guys just have girls. plus there another band who's has to mix ""sk8ing"" in to punk. The first punks didn't have skateboards. There lyrics are vulgar but they don't do it like anarchy in the uk did. The sex psitols got thrown out their own coutry all these guys ever did was get thrown out of a mall."
5,Greatest Band Ever,"Blink 182 is one of the best groups around. They are great at writing lyrics and are a great live show. Tom is one of the best guitarists I know. Mark is up front the most awesome bass player ever. Travis is so fast I'm sure he gets a new pair of hands after every show. This is Blinks sixth album. Through out their career thy have made great music and are continuing as you can see. I believe that Blink 182 still has a coupe of albums up their pants. And I also think that they wil alwys ""Take off their Pants and Jacket."""
4,to people saying that blink182 are sellouts,"this is the story of 3 guys who want to have some fun. they make a band, make some music, then a bunch of rich people decide that they want to throw millions of dollars at these 3 people and make them international superstars. You'd have to be crazy to turn that down, even for ""punk philosophy"". Isnt that the dream of any band? Or do you know people who actually want suck in their poor poor miserable lives?"
3,"Better than Sum41, worse than Dude Ranch","In a period of time where almost nothing but [junk] is being released in the pop-punk scene (e.g. New Found Glory, Sum41), Blink still manage to keep their crowns as the pop-punk kings, and they are still releasing quality music. True punk rockers would all agree that Dude Ranch is by far the best Blink album, and it still is. However, if you are a 13 year old girl looking for a pop-punk album, this is a good buy."
2,I won''t take off my pants for this album,"I would rather listen to this album than Britney Spears, Christina Agulaira, Avril Lavigne etc. any day of the week, but Blink 182 are sold out, and I think they made this album to please MTV. They don't care about making punk music anymore, they just want to make money, and I don't blame them, but that's what this album is. And the problem is, once you're mainstream, there's no going back. I'm sure at least 8/10 of you who like this album also like pop music, music that gets lots of radio play. If you want some 'real' Blink 182, buy Budha and Cheshire Cat, which are good punk albums, or Dude Ranch, a great pop-punk album.R.I.P. Blink 182"
1,What Happened?,Blink 182 had all good rock CDs up until now. This Take Your Pants and Jacket is lame. Anyone who had been a loyal fan of Blink 182 will despise this CD for a lot of reasons:1. The band's song's all sound the same2. The lyrics are forgettable3. The shots at humor are pathetic (Like the CD title) This can't even be called a punk CD-it's more like a laughable farce.
2,"Forced ""humor""--buy Enema of the State instead","This album sounds like Blink 182 thought they had to be funny and they really forced jokes. ...these don't seem natural at all. Enema did a much better job of it. Along the same lines, most of the deliveries are pretty uninspired. There are 2 songs on the album I like, the rest are pretty forgettable."
5,EVERY TRACK IS WORTH LISTENING TO,"This is the first CD by Blink182 I have purchased. I saw the music video ""The Rock Show"" on MTV like a million times and liked it so I thought id get the CD. After listening to the whole thing I am now a big Blink182 fan. If you like rock music ull like this CD. These guys are really good in my opinion. I would seriously recommend getting this CD!"
1,I Love Sarcasm,"BLINK 182 IS THE BEST! THIS IS DEFINATELY REAL PUNK. THEIR SONGS ARE SO POWERFUL AND YOU CAN TELL THEY SPENT A LOT OF TIME WRITING THEM. AND THE LYRICS ARE SO FUNNY! AND MARK AND TOM ARE SOO HOT. I WENT TO THEIR CONCERT AND I MADE A POSTER. I ALSO WORE MY FAVORITE BLINK 182 SHIRT AND I WROTE THEIR NAMES ON MY FACE. LIKE TOPHER SAID THERE IS SO MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BLINK AND A BOY BAND. JUST BECAUSE THEY BOTH MAKE MTV MUSIC VIDEOS AND ARE ON TRL AND HAVE SCREAMING 13 YEAR OLD FANS OBSESSED WITH THEM DOESN'T MAKE BLINK ANY LESS PUNK! AND LIKE KARST SAID THIS CD IS FOR MATURE PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE VERY PROFOUND SONG CONCEPTS AND EMOTIONS THAT THIS CD POSESSES. ALSO CHECK OUT SUM 41, FENIX TX, GOOD CHARLOTTE, AND NEW FOUND GLORY FOR MORE PURE AMAZING PUNK ROCK!"
5,This CD RULEZ!!!,"I bought it on its release date (06/12/01) and I haven't stopped listening to it yet. I like every song on it. The hidden tracks are kind of nasty, but funny."
5,Doesn't Matter,"This is not punk, and it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what you class Blink 182 as because their music goes much further than labels and the people who listen to the music. The only thing that bothers me is that 10 year old kids listen to the music, and that kinda ticks you off, but you know what it is simple and everyone enjoys it. There is not alot to think about, just pure riffs and excellent beats. If you are looking for more serious music buy Boxcar Racer. Once again it isnt punk, but the record is beautifully polished and produced and after listening to the record through you develop questions in your mind, the messages are differant, but the quality is top notch. I am on the edge of my seat for the new blink cd!"
2,SBC Executive Series Phone,"I am a remote associate for a firm and so I need a high quality phone. This phone is okay, but the speaker volume does not get high, you get a lot of interference in the speaker. The headset volume is not very good either and makes it difficult to hear. The caller ID also record out of town calls but when you hit redial they error out because you have to push one first. Kind of annoying, invest dollars in a better product."
5,Divine Knowledge,"Here is a thorough book on spiritual wisdom, written in easy English to make it accessible to the general public with spiritual inclinations. The Swami covers way more than meditation- the disciplines of chanting, prayer, rituals, image-worship, self-effort to learn more are all explained well. He also provides a short course each on the spiritual disciplines of sages like Adi Sankara, Ramanuja, and so on. The most important chapter may be the `Nine Means of Devotion', where he quotes the well-known sloka from Bhagavata (VII.5.18). This sloka teaches the nine aspects of bhakti. This book must be read and re-read, because each time, the reader finds something new. Such is the power of spiritual wisdom."
2,Dis like the new Doctor,"David Tenant was the best Doctor by far. Replacing him was a huge mistake...I was entertained by the new Doctor and his companion, but I still miss David Tenatn. I will give it one more season to see if he can turn it around... but my hope's are fading fast."
3,No Fear,"This episode does not have a well defined ""sense of danger"". The plot moves along with less pathos than the better adventures. Perhaps the actors are still trying to learn how to play their characters. However it does introduce some facets of the Doctors personality and foretells the type of companion Amy will be or not to be, that is the ..."
5,Geronimo!,"As someone who started at the beginning of NewWho Season 9 and fell head over heels for David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor, I refused to even entertain the possibility of liking Matt Smith. David Tennant was ""my"" Doctor, no ifs ands or buts! Buuut, after watching the first episode of series 5, I was hooked. Smith's Doctor and Moffat's direction, bring something new and refreshing to the show. He's a young and passionate Doctor who doesn't let the burdens of his previous regenerations weigh him down and dampen the fun he can have in this one. Add to that the fantastic dynamic between himself and Amy Pond, and eventually the tag-along Rory and everything combines to make a really fantastic show that keeps you coming back for more, devouring every in-video commentary and Doctor Who Confidential available!"
4,"Unacceptable Price, Amazon","Four for content - Matt Smith is excellent, though I still prefer the Tennant era. However, my complaint here is that the S5 box-set shot up from $51 to $68 overnight, while Barnes & Noble still has it for $40... What the hell, Amazon??"
3,Too disjointed,"Dr. Who is a good series, has been for all of these decades, but this Dr. Who is just too disjointed. It gets to be a task just to sit through an episode. But still I had to watch. Why give up now?"
1,Sound is messed up!!!!!,Never had a problem with any video till this 1 and the sound is all jacked up.
3,"Now, River!","The Doctor is in over his head when River returns. She seems to be always two jumps ahead of him.Pure Moffat: The ""She can always find him in a museum"" joke -- Ouch! He's ""young"" where it counts, River! It's not like you can find anyone else who reads ancient languages -- and has an encyclopedic knowledge of the history of several worlds.I like River. Yes, she can be a royal pain. But she's easily his equal in knowledge and cleverness and determination.WHO is River Song? An older Jenny? The mystery deepens . . .."
5,"I am one of the few, it seems",". . . who really enjoyed this episode. But then, I grew up with Tom. This seemed to be something like a ""Fourth Doctor and the Gallifreyans"" political drama episode. With a small nod to Colin -- the fit of pique at having to ""essentially kill"" the whale to save it.And yes, go Amy! ""Gotcha!"" indeed."
3,I really wanted to like this one.,"A Pertwee-era adventure (sans UNIT) in a remote Welsh village. The best bit: Matt and the boy. This Doctor gets kids, but then, he's very child-like himself. Smart Doctor: figure out who can give you what you need, and befriend them.The wise, centuries-old man in the athletic teenager's body has to encourage frightened, wary humans to do the right thing. It is better that they represent themselves. Who knows whether or not he'll be around in 150 years?"
1,holy bible-king james version,The print is microscopic. It is illegible and one would need a magnifying glass to read. It will cause headaches and eye-strain to a severe degree. Very disappointing at the font size of letters/print.
5,Works magic with my Aneros,"Many reviews sing the praises of this lube, and I have to agree. For most of my toys, I use a waterbased lube (either of the Gels from KY or Astroglide). Recently I added an Aneros prostate stimulator to my collection (wow!), and I like to leave it in longer than my typical toys stay. Waterbased lubes tend to dry out quicker, but just the smallest coating of Wet on the Aneros Progasm and I'm good to go for hours. Great product."
4,1 of my 2 favorites,Me and the ladyfriend always seem to prefer silicone to water based even if its known to mess up the sheets. Such a better price here than local stores. Easy to use cap container and arrives in discrete packaging also wouldn't look crazy on a dresser. This and gun oil are the two faves we have found. Lasts longs almost has a feel of a warming gell without the smell of petroleum. ok if you taste a little never easy to clean though.
4,Footsteps of The little Dragon,"The movie of course is not the original Bruce lee But one of the famous Bruce lee imitators or follower to be more polite Bruce le who was fairly famous in South east Asia at the time I saw it (1982).As now over the last couple of years since 1988 ever since Jackie Chan has been turning out very successful movies Bruce le has become obscure.Getting to the point this particular movie was not too bad.Bruce le is a martial artist in his own right and has speed,Explosiveness and power.The movie's plot is also pretty good and in my opinion like the original Bruce lee movies the fights are not too much in number and so the viewer does not have to say oh it is the same kick punch and kick syndrome like other some other Bruce lee look alike movies.The last fight in particular had some good crisp techniques that were displayed.Thank youV.Ram Kumar"
2,Down Hill,"This CD is not even close to being as good as the Lights Off album. All he raps about is money, girls, and cars. With wack beats and even worse lyrics, it's undeniable that Cash Money is going no where fast. Can I get my money back???"
2,Dissapointment,"This album was a dissapointment. I expected better from Lil' wayne, but when I heard it i was not impressed. Hopefully his next album out will get back at it."
5,sammy,"come on, you gotta give props to the man, he put his daughter on the album on her own track and it sounds so phat. the entire album itself is worth it, but i have to say that made me think about putting my niece on a cd or something. the sound of the album itself is a much different sound then the rest of the juggalo sound, sort of as if it wasn't associated with psychopathic.mad mad world should have made it big, but it makes you think about what is really going on.joke ya mind was done magnificently. that has always been one of my favorite ICP songs."
5,The real deal,"This shampoo is fantastic. I have struggled with sebhorric dermatitis for years and whatever worked would only work for a short period of time and then I would have to find something new. Numerous visits to the dermatologist with the same results. To make matters worse as I got older and needed to dye my hair all the dandruff shampoos stripped the color. Dermazinc cleared my scalp completely, I have been using it for a year and it still works great! My hairdresser took the name of it to recommend to other clients as she couldn't believe the difference and it doesn't effect my hair color at all. Couldn't be happier with the product."
1,My first & last book by this author,This was my first book by this author. I was quite excited because of all the good reviews for her writing. I could not connect with these characters. There was absolutely no chemistry between the two. I found it quite annoying that Gavin always said and did the perfect thing. He had no passion whatsoever. Very boring book.
4,A very informative book,"I've found this book to be as informative as any book written on equity options to date. Tompkins takes on a complex subject and makes it understandable . If I could make only one suggestion to the author , it would be "" Talk more about takeovers "" ; the effects on option pricing and volatility :...A definate buy for the person looking to understand the equity options enviroment..

4,Great Waterproof Mascara.,"Believe me ... I've tried out many mascara's before finding this one. In my opinion it beats out Dior.The product itself is excellent quality ... goes on smoothly and doesn't budge after it's on. I've slept with it on as well (am sure to get in trouble over that!)Since I live in the southwest, I'd have racoon eyes if I didn't use waterproof mascara and eyeliner and this is absolutely the best.The brush is a bit unusual if you are expecting one of those big, fluffy ones. It's skinny and does take some getting used to but it also makes it easier to get at all the lashes.You will need a good eye makeup remover though ... it does not come off easily because of it's staying power. I find that Neutrogena's eye makeup remover does a great job on this mascara"
4,Great for asian lashes!,"I was never a fan of using mascara because they never did anything to my lashes. My lashes stick straight down, very short and sparse, but this mascara hold my lashes curled all day! It can be a bit clumpy if you use too much, try using mascara that helps separate your lashes, then on top, use this mascara and you'll get perfect lashes! :)"
4,Lively disc of bluegrass legends and stars,"Originally taped live at the legendary Ryman Auditorium, this celebration of Bluegrass' legends and current stars has been a staple of PBS fundraising nights all across the country. Now available on both CD and DVD, the program captures highlights from bluegrass founders Earl Scruggs and Ralph Stanley, legendary players Ricky Skaggs, Vince Gill and Alison Krauss, and country stars like Patty.The program provides a good introduction to the riches of Bluegrass, including the hot-picking of Kentucky Thunder and Earl Scruggs, Ralph Stanley's bone-chilling a capella ""O Death,"" and the generational interconnection of standards like Bill Monroe's ""Uncle Pen."" The DVD edition adds three tracks to the CD: Earl Scruggs' ""Passin' Through,"" Ralph Stanley's ""Rocky Island,"" and a group finale of ""Little Maggie."""
4,Easy to read and kept my interest.,"This is the second book I've read by Erica Spindler; the first was CAUSE FOR ALARM, which was terrific! I was slightly disappointed in this book because it did not hold my interest as much as CAUSE FOR ALARM did. However, the book kept my interest and it was a good storyline. I found the friendship a big unbelievable, though. I don't think there are any friends like that in the world that constantly say ""I love you"" and ""you're my family"" as much as that was repeated in this book. Ms. Spindler still writes a great book and I look forward to reading another novel by her."
3,good so far,this book is really good so far. Very catchy ... i cant put it down. I have not finished it but i can not wait to. Author is not the best but she did a good job with the storyline.
5,She has some good points,The suggestions in this book are not expensive. It is always good to get back to the basics. This book has sent me back out doors to enjoy my own little slice of nature. I don't think she is suggesting others to recreate her experiences but to consider your own. This book is a very good buy.
1,not so good,"I was really looking forward to trying this espresso blend and was very disappointed, the beans were very dry, unlike most espresso lenses we h ave purchased before. Usually the beans look oily or wet and have a nice crema on top where this blend did not. We won't purchase this brand again."
