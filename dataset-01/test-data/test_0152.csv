3,mountain of the cannibal god on dvd,"I SAW THIS FILM AT THE CINEMA A LOT OF YEARS AGO SO I KNEW WHAT I WAS BUYING, THE FILM IS NOT THAT BAD BUT IT IS WORTH WATCHING JUST TO SEE A NAKED URSULA ANDRESS.(MAIN REASON I BOUGHT IT)"
2,budget model - poor construction,"I just disassembled and fixed one. It was having trouble switching to new tunes - instead would just make a whirring sound.Problem was that the head motor was loose and flopping - there was no sign of anything that might have held it in position - not foam, screw, clip, or glue.Construction-wise, I am not favorably impressed. It's a budget model. That's why the display is so small and primitive.Also compares very poorly in features to the other CD-MP3 players I've owned."
4,"the unicorns pull a ""milli vanilli""","there is a contest to enter a music video so the unicorns decide to do it, but none of them can really sing, so they got a classmate of theirs to sing and they lip synched to it and sent it in thinking they won't win, but when they won a trip to perform the song they are stuck. But it works out at the end cause they bring the classmate with them and she sings instead."
3,The Hunt For Red October,I have the book on Kindle. I am finding it hard to read because of all the technical material . However the plot is fascinating.
1,Bowring!,"This is the most bowring book I ever read, it makes the russian navy look as If they were stupid. I think that you can spent your money in something better, look for THE RAINMAKER, thats a good book."
5,Clancy at his best,"This book has to be one of the best that I've ever read, and I've read quite a few. For anyone who has any interest in military operations and/or the Cold War, this is the ultimate book. Clancy puts together an interesting and suspensful plot that, as in all of his works, he manages to tie together nicely in the end. He tells this story from many view points and superbly combines historical fiction with historical fact to create a story so captivating that only a master author like himself could have written it. Truly an excellent book!"
5,Read before you see the movie!,"You really must read this short book (by Clancy standards) before you watch the movie. For me, this was the book that hooked me on Clancy. This is the definition of ""a page-turner"". I can see how seeing the movie might put some people off, but the entertainment from the book is just like being in the intelligence community"
2,Desperately Needs an Editor,"I enjoyed the overall plot and Jack Ryan's character; they were the only elements that kept me dedicated to completing the novel. Clancy could have edited 40% of the text out and had a much better story. This novel is bogged down with irrelevant character descriptions, military acronyms, tedious sub-plots, and background stories that have nothing to contribute to the novel's overall focus. I found myself constantly frustrated with the monotonous length it took to cover simple plot points. Clancy obviously has a huge audience; however, he needs an effective editor. This novel is a very slow read."
5,The Start of Something Great,"Tom Clancy established himself as both the invemtor and the master of an entire genre with just one book. Many people know it from the movie, but the book is so much better (as many books-into-movies are.) The scope of the novel and the way that Clancy sets up future novels is extrordinary. Go ahead, read the rest of the Jack Ryan series (essentially, everything except Red Storm and Without Remorse) and then go back to the Hunt. Clancy has truly created a parallel universe that is frighteningly close to our own. A truly gripping read"
2,Exciting but fundamentally flawed,"I don't want to trash a really good book, but one aspect of this book is really off the mark. Tom Clancy's research is legendary so I don't know how this got by him. Captain Marko Ramius is the Lithuanian-born commanding officer on the Soviet nuclear submarine Red October. That's the problem right there. The Soviets would never, ever, ever, ever, ever let a Lithuanian (even a half Lithuanian) be captian of anything....ever. It never happened, it never would. So that ruined the beginning of the book for me."
2,"Okay, but pretty slow","I read the book for school. I like reading a book slowly, so I was fairly rushed with this one. It moves very slowly and technical, irrelevant information is also included."
5,Enthralling . . .,"The Hunt for Red October is a great piece of military literature. It is full of suspense (unless you've seen the movie and know what will happen) and shocking detail. It's difficult to catch all of it if you try to go through it too fast. If you will just take your time and concentrate on it, it is exceptional. There are a few parts where the techincal detail gets a bit too involved, and it can get a bit boring, but just read through it and more action will arrive. It is a bit hard to understand since Tom Clancy tries to make sure that no one knows what is going on until it happens, hoping to build the suspense (and succeeding) but making it a bit tedious to keep reading and not know what's going on. I'd only recommend this to serious readers, because it is an intelligent book. If you just want the action, watch the movie."
3,Ultra-detailed thriller still holds up!,"Clancy's first Jack Ryan novel is so detailed I'm pretty sure I could pilot a Russian submarine. Its pretty amazing some of the knowledge that he was able to attain and included in the novel in a way that fit in and didn't read like a manual. The cast got too huge at times but overall a good book, just a little dense."
5,Classic Cold War Tension!,"I read this book before I saw the film, and I think that was advantageous. The film displays much of the ideas, but the same tension is not there as with the book. Clancy jumps around from one location and set of characters to the next, driving the reader on to get to the rest of the previous portion's story. This helps solidify tense aspects and speed up slower sections. This work is very entertaining as well as demonstrates how a lone ship had the potential during the cold war to stir up a plethora of panic. Great military fiction."
2,Highly overated; Clancy is better than this,"I have read many of, and am a fan of, Tom Clancy's books, and have seen him mature as a writer. I say this because after reading this ""novel,"" it was clear that he had a lot of maturing to do! 'The Hunt for Red October' was, I thought, nothing more than an excuse for putting a virtual glossary of submarine warfare terms onto the printed page. It really appeals only to people with an interest in naval affairs. That said, I have an interest in naval affairs too, and I still found it boring. However, it does function well in describing to the audience what the world of warfare under the sea is like. In some ways, the movie was better than the book, which is a rare occurence indeed. By the time he wrote 'Debt of Honor,' Clancy had learned quite a bit more about how to actually produce a good read, and it showed. Historically, of course, the book is quite important as it ushered in the age of the ""technothriller"" novel that is still very much with us."
2,misleading,"the book was quite entertaining but was nothing special. Since my family comes from a former communistic country (hungary) I know quite well how life was behind the iron curtain. I think the author is absolutely misleading the reader with his clichee that people from russia act like robots in the aparatschik, that all russians are dumb and that the american technology is far better then the russian ones. It is absolutely not true. Unfortunately these books do not help to much to get a better understanding about other cultures and lifes. it puts a wrong middleaged understanding into american people minds(rusky = enemy, stupid, robot etc) which is not very helpful for the global future. (by the way I am not very fond of the russians (neither of the americans))"
1,Why do people like this?,I have no idea why anyone would buy or read this book. I read the book and fell asleep many times while reading it in the middle of the day. Tom Clancy sure does not make it easy for people to understand what is going on and his technical wording and deep descriptions make this book one of the worst I have ever read. I would recommend watching the movie if you really want to know this story.
4,"Tom Clancy's First, and Arguably Best.","This is an excellent submarine thriller, and if you can get through all the detail that Mr. Clancy is noted for, you will enjoy the book. It made an excellent movie as well. I love submarine thrillers, and this is certainly not the worst in the genre."
2,Not a field guide,"This is a good little introductory text, with reasonable diagrams and easy-to-read short chapters. But it is absolutely not a field guide. It does not help one when out in the field. It does not help to identify rocks, fossils, minerals, etc. Its purpose is clearly to educate and to excite the student when indoors; not to provide a reference when outdoors. With a different title it would appeal to a more appropriate audience."
5,Just plain good recipes,My family has several favorites in this easy to use book. The cornbread recipe is the best I have ever had. It is amazing how many simple meals can be made in a well seasoned iron pan.
4,"Great content, poor book quality","I LOVE this cookbook, my only complaint is that the cover is a soft paper and the inside pages are the very fragile recycled-newspaper type that tear or melt away at the smallest drop of fluid. A wonderful paper for a novel, not so great for a cookbook that will get messy on my counter. I wish the pages were sturdier so it could withstand the decades that I'd like to have this book for-or at least 5 years."
5,"""It's brilliant, but it's mental."" -Jack Frost","Essentially, it's what would happen if Quentin Tarantino, Oliver Stone, and Robert Anton Wilson were to have a few drinks and then write a comic book together"
1,The Most Overrated Series In Comics History,"This is a piece of fiction which characterizes the Marqui de Sade as a hero and advocates disobedience to authority (with all authority figures in the series given corrupt personalities by Morrison)as the pathway to ""salvation"" for mankind. The book earns 5 stars for offensiveness and 1 star for the artwork, which is lackluster. The writing, from the provenly talented Grant Morrison, rates a surprizing -5. It's that bad. Avoid this series like the plague."
3,"Quick Read, a Good Idea or Two, but Otherwise Not a Lot of Substance","If you have not yourself been involved in reaching out to others through volunteering and giving financially but want to encourage your children in these areas, Weisman's book would be a good idea starter. Her information is sound, her intentions are good, and the very brief text is clear and well-supplied with some thoughts on where to begin.Beyond these high and noble intentions, however, there isn't a lot here, and I would highly recommend checking the book out of the library rather than buying it. Then give the $15 you'll save to a worthwhile cause. Better yet, involve your children in finding out how what that $15 will buy when given to a favorite charity."
2,"Good ideas, but little purpose","While this book is a good beginning resource for ideas to help children be generous, I was disappointed by how short the book is (I read the whole thing in 30 minutes) and it's lack of significantly new thoughts on the topic. It is written from a purely philanthropic perspective, so don't expect to find any religious traditions/reasons for promoting generosity in the next generation. In fact, it is this lack of an overall reason for why we need to raise our children to be charitable that left me feeling unfulfilled by this book's message. Without a framework (or dare I say ""moral code"") at the base, the examples cited feel isolated and empty ... a message of ""do anything"" rather than ""do what's important"".That said, it has some good ideas to get kids started and I certainly don't disagree with the methods for encouraging generous acts."
2,Imposters!!,"I am sorry, but there can only ever be one ""Mecano"" and one Ana Torroja. This group is obviously a wannabe Mecano. They are trying to free ride off of the success that Mecano had in the 80's and 90's with their very unique style of music, metaphorical and deep lyrics, and Ana's very angelic voice. In fact, I on couple of occasions mistakened Amaia, or whatever her name is', voice for la increible Ana. No compren esta cd!!!! Its not original enough!"
1,Even the girl on the CD falls asleep because it is BORING!!,"The cd is BORING. In simple words, there is no meaning to listen to this music. I was really expecting good music from them, but I was totally dissapointed. PLEASE listen to it before buying the CD. I assure you that you WONT BUY IT. ALL THE SONGS SOUND THE SAME. IT IS SO PLAIN AND SIMPLE."
3,Not As Pictured!,"This turned out to be a nice gift but not as nice as the item pictured on the website. The item I received did not have a hinged top, only a slide-out plexi-glass top (undamaged). Also, the tube was engraved with cartoony flowers and other items with the words ""Birth Certificate"" smaller on the side, not at all as elegant as the picture makes it look. It makes a nice gift as long as the buyer knows what he is getting!"
1,"good idea, but not worth it",I read other reviews about the product being damaged and sure enough when i got this product the glass was cracked so i returned it. I didn't want to take the chance of replacing it as shipping it back to seller cost more to return than worth the product.I would not recommend this product
1,NOT a clarinettist by ANY standard,"This guy couldn't play his way out of a paper bag. He has NO tone, technique, sense of rhythm, or musical savvy. His butchering of the Mozart concerto is an insult to all clarinet players.Even his performances of his own ethnic music stinks.This man is a joke.I seriously believe the positive reviews here are fakes staged by his publicist."
4,Excellent,I like this album because they're some wondeful songs. She is my best siger. She is better than Ashanti! Ashanti is nothing ! I really recommend itto buy this album.
1,"only 1 star because there was not a ""NO STAR"" option","It looks really cute on the picture but because of the way it is built the head ""lid"" falls off if you tip or barely bump it! I bought it as a gift for my grand daughter who is turning 12 this year to start a collection of teapots but I would be afraid for her to handle it even to dust it!"
4,Pleasing...,"The music on this CD is pleasing and upbeat in a mellow way. No sung words but it does have vocals. A good CD to do a moderate level of activity to...such as walking, housework, etc."
5,The Secret Life of the Brain,"PBS has done it again. Excellent videos (five total). Telling about the workings of the Baby, Child, Teen, Adult and then aging brain and the wonders of each age group."
4,It's a replacement.,"Ordered this to replace an ancient cutting board that began to drip through the seams. This one seems sturdy enough and well made, although it is a bit smaller than I anticipated. Hope it lasts as long as the one it's replacing!!"
1,How could this become such a success?,"This book is tripe. Science Fiction is one of my favorite genres, but this is some of the worst I've ever read.The characters are not very likeable, but the worst thing about this book is the plot - or rather: The lack of same.Hamilton has filled his book with hundreds upon hundreds of pages with trivial action, cruelty, attempts at horror, death and violence. There's nothing wrong with any of these things in a story if they serve a purpose, but here they seem to be the purpose and only content of a very long book.It's not surprising that books like this are written - in fact, they're written every day. What I can't understand is why this one became such a success."
2,Spaceship yarn,"Space opera to the core. By no means bad for what it is, but don't be expecting Iain Banks (like I did!) cos you'll be dissapointed."
2,Tedious,"i started reading this book because it was high ranked in the SCI-FI top 100 books list. i also read other books bythe same author like the pandora saga, which i found entertaining and the first void book, which was half good.however i found reading this book to be very tedious and boring experience.i will not repeat what other reviwers wrote here before, because i find most of the negative reviews to be true.this saga is not very interesting, and where is the main plot line / where does the story starts ? the big problem ofcourse non of the characters are really interesting to bind you to keep on reading."
1,Cruel sex demeans this work.,"Other reviewers have mentioned sex, but not how cruel it can be in this book. The young female colonists are constantly raped. On page 222 Quinn rapes a 17 year old boy as part of a Satanic ritual. It's a slow, disjointed, rambling work. It seems to be promising, but I refuse to read any more rape scenes. There is just way too much cruelty."
2,Excruciating. I mean it.,"I was in the mood for a grand space opera epic when I picked up this one. Consequently, as a trade-off, I was willing to accept some 2D characters, neato-keen pseudoscience and Star Trekkish mumbo jumbo, and I was not disappointed. There are people who will enjoy this, and I even grant that there is a certain charm to it on some level (hence two stars, rather than one). What I was not prepared for, and eventually overwhelmed me, was the excruciating detail in which Hamilton apparently feels compelled to describe every last particle of his story. If there was a method to this madness, I would not complain, but the last straw was when he took a paragraph to describe the action at the molecular level of a laser beam cutting through a spaceship hull. (No, I'm not joking!) Talk about senseless! No wonder his story is ballooning to 3600+ pages... I simply could not bear to finish this book, and I recommend you avoid it."
2,"Not bad, but overlong","The Reality Dysfunction is a real mixed bag. It's full of great concepts and it's set in an interesting universe. The plot is reasonably engaging, and some of the characters are well done. The writing is at times good, but at other times sloppy. (Hamilton seems to have real problems with point of view at times.)Overall, though, it's far too long for what it is. This volume is about the first sixth of the overall trilogy (it's half of the first book), and it's almost 600 pages long. There really isn't enough here to merit that length. It's dissapointing, because it really had the potential to be much better."
5,Blew my mind,"I picked this up on recommendation from a store employee. So I wasn't expecting much, but this book blew me away. This is one of the most spectacular displays of science fiction that I have ever read. The only problem stems from the fact that the author's British and so spells things weird. In spite of that: Prepare to be amazed."
3,Pretty Good Fantasy in Pseudo-Science Setting,"This is a pretty good read, tho it drags in spots. For a while, it keeps one wondering whether it is going to turn out to be science-fiction or fantasy. If you like large, expansive novels, you will probably enjoy this one. If not, don't even start.watziznaym@gmail.com"
1,I found Hamilton's prose to be awkward and lacking in rhythm,"I should first admit that I did not read much of the book -- but this is because I simply found that many of the sentences Hamilton builds are awkward. I don't have the book in front of me, so I unfortunately can't quote anything. But even in space operas which do not purport to be 'Great Literature' I expect the prose to flow with a certain grace, and here it did not. I am simply putting this comment in here to see if anyone else had the same reaction."
4,Sweeping Epic,"Impossible to read only one of this series - you must read all 6 books and you will be hooked after this first one. Very complicated plot involving a huge range of characters which is a bit confusing at first but gradually all the threads draw together. The hard sci fi is very well done, some of the relationships are not as well done, but it does keep you interested. Other reviews have mentioned the graphic violence, which is at times hard to read, but Hamilton is attempting to get across the true nature of evil and the violence does indeed convey that. And lots of very creative characters such as the xenocs , as well as the sentient habitants and voidhawks. Overall, I think most sci fi fans will enjoy this immensely."
5,Once again hamilton demonstrates his ability to create a believable universe,"Like the Void Trillogy and the Commonwealth Saga, Hamilton shows his unparalleled ability to describe a new universe with believable three dimensional characters and a compelling plot, with many different factions coming together in a moment of crisis to face a threat to humanity. Followers of most other science fiction novels may be in for a bit of a shock here, as the novels are very dense and LONG compared to others and traverse many more points of view than most. I think that they are most similar to, but still a bit longer than the Culture novels by Iain M Banks. So keep in mind, that reading this requires a bit of dedication and it can be tempting to put it down at times for the more casual reader, but it is indeed a work worth finishing, and a very rare breed of science fiction indeed."
4,Some great ones.,"What is there to add here? It's the best from last year. Some of the essays were about things I didn't care about, like a tedious thing on wine, but I just skipped those. The ones I was into, I was really into."
2,Know what you're doing before using this product,"There are other ich and parasite treatments out there, if you are a fish-newb.This is actually a pretty dangerous treatment for fish if you don't monitor your copper levels. The instructions say take out all your fish while you're treating it, and to check your copper levels before treatment. Your fish are really sensitive to this treatment, so expect dead fish if you put it in the water with the fish.I used this on my tank, following the directions, and I treated it for 4 days (the life of ich is 4 days, so I treated it 4 just to make sure. Unfortunately, it didn't work. I bought some different Ich treatment from a fish store and it worked right away with no problems to the health of the fish.I recommend using another treatment. If you google this one, you'll learn that it isn't the best---it's pretty archaic."
1,"terrible, long winded....waste of money","I bought this book hoping to gain a little insight in Ms. Joplin and her life. the writer has no insight on the woman other than a drunken tour in 1970. I find my self skipping thru his 'philosophical BS, looking for snippets of meaningles conversations Janis had with randon bar patrons. UGH what a waste of money. highly NOT reccomended."
5,Great book to pass down,"This is a great book to read to your daughter and then pack a copy for future generations. This became a memory for my daughter and I when she was small we read it all the time:) I gave her a copy of the book as a gift when she was 1,8 she read it again and then put it away, like the elephant in the book to save for a time when she might also have a daughter to read it to."
1,Not much better than MSDN,"This book is simply a rehash of that which is contained in MSDN.The information is organized a little better than what is found in MSDN. However, there is little to no detail given on most of the material covered. Furthermore, the examples are nothing more than code snippets, most of which are very difficult to even compile and execute.I think that a good book should contain examples that can be compiled and executed without much difficulty.The author really needed to add a lot more detail about the directshow architecture and especially the APIs which he seems to references without explanation.In summary, this book makes light reading out of a subject which is not meant to be ""glazed over"". Because of that, I would STRONGLY recommend against buying this book."
2,Criticisms made by other reviewers are valid,"There is some good info in this book (especially on COM, DAO, and RDO), but the overall presentation is verbose, frequently disorganized, and ultimately ineffective as a WinArch exam study guide. Far too many pages are spent on personal opinions, Microsoft bashing, off-subject material, and reference-style lists of interfaces, objects, etc... If the author intended to write a reference book on Windows Architecture, then the title and advertising for this book should reflect that. Watch out for the section on Microsoft Solutions Framework: the author claims it gives you enough info to answer exam questions, but it doesn't cover three out of the six MSF models."
2,Information Overload,"The book is definitely filled with useful information, but enough is enough! I began reading the book in-depth, but later skimmed the rest after the third chapter or so. Now that Microsoft is retiring these tests, I'll use it as a reference guide."
1,This is a study guide?,"The author needs to do some serious re-thinking about what the difference between a ""study guide"" and a ""Reference guide"" is.There is so much stuff in here that isn't covered on the tests. Also, the author thinks it's funny to make you figure out alot of the stuff on the test on your own. He is terribly wrong. For all that matter, you might as well just use MSDN to study and save yourself $60.Beware...this book is NOT a study guide. It's a reference guide. As such you'll spend 3 times as long studying for 2 times as much material than you need to."
2,Not a place to start to study for the MS Win. Arch. I exam.,"This book has some good information in it, but its hard to get at. It tends to be wordy and does not focus on exam requirements well. I understand the author's disappointment with Microsoft in some areas, but a book to studying for a MS certification exam is not the place to discuss those disappointments. This is probably a better general reference than a book to use to prepare for the Windows Arch. I exam."
1,"Netscape, Sun, and the DOJ would be proud",Why an author would write a study guide cliaming to be for the MCSD and then continually point out how poor Microsoft's way of doing things is and how much better the author could do things is beyond me. What on earth does the author's anti-Microsoft viewpoint have to do with studying for a Microsoft exam?This book reads more like the author was trying to get his pent up agression out at Microsoft rather than write a study guide for the exams.
2,This is a great reference guide!,"However, it's a lousy study guide. Does the author truely understand what making a study guide means or is he thoughougly convinced that a reference guide crammed with 50% material that does not appear on the exam objectives = a great study guide for the test? The material is also presented in a very confusing and chaotic style. I doubt Microsoft would get the warm fuzzies knowing the author's negative slant toward their programming techniques. This is comical in a way because the author's own code examples in the book show mistakes.The author's own recommendation that you will need Transcender in order to pass the exam says it all. This book does not do a good job at preparing one for the exams.Get Transcender and the MCSD. That's all you need to study and pass the exams."
5,Ultimate in Soft Indulgence.,"Even nicer than I'd imagined, this mattress pad is uber-soft and does a great job of wicking away moisture. Perfect for hot flashes or staying warm when it's cold. Good value."
5,Enlightening,"By using vivid characterization and clever prose, Hirsh prompts readers to explore how world politics, family relationships, and individual duty are intertwined -- not only in the frame of the novel, but in their own lives, as well. The novel provides a fascinating perspective on Afghanistan, and illustrates the need for passive observers to cross the boundary separating basic knowledge of current events and deep understanding of the causes behind them."
5,Great Book,"If you love Middle Eastern literature, you will love this book. If you liked the Kite Runner, you will love this book. Its a good read!"
3,Good DVD,Really enjoyed the show but the DVD only contains 4 episodes on it. I thought that it was the rest of season 1 but it wasn't. Was disappointed and send it back. If it would have had the whole season I would have kept it.
5,You MUST have this CD in your collection!!!,"There are very few CDs I've listened to where every song on the album has been amazing. (Pearl Jam-TEN, Lenny Kravitz-MAMA SAID, U2-THE JOSHUA TREE, Dave Matthews-CRASH, etc.) This is definitely one of those CDs. If you don't have it yet, please do yourself a favor and get it. Regardless of what type of music you listen to, I absolutely guarantee you will love this album. The more you listen to it, the more you'll love each song. I played the original vinyl album to death and I just bought the CD."
2,Feels Sorta Good,"The only problem I've ever had with Chuck Mangione is that he plays sharp all the time. Other than that- I love his stuff. I also agree that the title track is fab, but especially the guitar solo is stellar. He, unfortunately, gets cut off right as he's starting to cook. Quite frustrating!"
1,wouldn't work on XBox 360 as it says,"I think the game would have been fun if I could have used it. It said even though it was for XBox it could be played on XBox 360. It lied. It can not. I've gone online and they haven't made a ""patch"" so it can be used on XBox 360 that I can find. So I have a game and no way to play it now."
5,The Best of Best,"Having read all of Mr. Doss' book I declare it the best. His descriptions of Colorado country are outstanding and breathtaking. The role of Charlie Moon pictured him as a thinking, acting investigator. The supporting character of Aunt Daisy was brief, but very strong and their love and care for each other is needed in today's society. I like the short chapters, but this is not a book you can start and come back to later. It leaves you with the qustion of ""what will happen next?"" Lots of action and plenty of colorful characters. Thank you, Mr. Doss"
3,Cute Book,"We enjoy this book and read it frequently, but it is not one of our favorite Boynton books. Our favorites are: Not the Hippopotamus, The Belly Button Book, Barnyard Dance, and Your Personal Penguin. Our daughter is too young to be scared of this book, but I think it could be scary with the monsters who come and steal your cake and presents."
5,Holy Bible for shell Collectioneers,"Its REALLY table book for beginner and middle-advanced shell collectioners!Must have piece! Gorgeous book.Yes, it have some mistakes due permanently changing classifications, butall online synonym dictionaries easily solve any question.Book made with strong and good-wearing thick paper sheets, have not largebut really clear and sharp photos.I collect shells last 26 years, have about 1600 specimens (over 4000 items)and my opinion that this book will be primary bible,and only for most interesting families - additionally - visayas andiconographies from Poppe's son and fatger.Have a nice shelling, friends!"
5,Friends in Shanghai,One of the best albums we've heard! I highly recommend it for anyone's C-D collection.
5,BEST STAR TREK SHOW IN ALL OF TREK!,"This episode is the best of all Star Trek - all the series and all the movies (including first contact) -- The graphics are kick a$$, as well as the story line. This beats first contact, which seems to get dull and the story becomes vague at times, and the highlight of the movie is over at the beginning. This episode is full of suspense, drama, and anticipation, a must see! the best of ALL TREK HISTORY HANDS DOWN!"
5,Probably my favourite movie of all time.,"I remeber this movie from so far back, just relating to the ""california"" quote that Jimmy does throughout the movie. Fred Savage is about 30 now (in 2000), but seems the same as he was in this movie to me. Another thing that made this on top of my list was the Nintendo factor; I was obsessed when this movie came out, but I had already figured out the whistle secret. I need to get this movie right away. Watch it, it is the best EVER."
1,The Wizard- How Corny Can You Get?,"Ok, the film was entertaining, and I am a SNES fan, but The Wizardis too much. Too many mistakes, too many badly written lines. Kids will like it because of the video game content, but otherwise, this has to be just about the worst film I've ever seen. My Dinner With Andre was the first worst, The Wizard is the next. Do not even think about renting this!!!!!! CAN WE SAY BAD? BAD! BAD! BAD!"
5,A Plus Adventure,"Absolutely one of the best movies ever produced pertaining to the NES generation - for those of us who caught the tail end of the Atari faze, but were there for the spawning of the new dimension in home entertainment systems... This movie was a thrill in the theater and remains so even now, closing in on 20 yrs. later! I can't ever see this one too many times, and anyone who truly loved the NES will enjoy it as well, no doubt. Fred Savage and Christian Slater put on the best performances of their younger careers and really add a lot to the entire atmosphere... The soundtrack is also great, incorporating excellent music right from the era that'll take you right back there to the time. Don't listen to the critics - buy this one!"
5,The Wizard,This is a great family movie that everyone can watch and have fun watching. If you liked video games this is the movie for YOU:)
3,not as good as expected,"Well going by the reviews and a friend from work this was supposedto be a brilliant movie, well it wasn't and the acting was , well notall that good, watchable but that was about it."
4,SID is a cop,"This story about him is true, he goes undercover as a biker,he really looks a gang member too."
4,Good True Story,"This is a good movie based on a true story. Charlie sheen is thrown into an undercover situation with very little training - two people could blow his cover at any time. Some might find the bike-building scene as a distraction, but I liked it. I think the portrait of some of the nuances of biker groups was rich in detail. Only complaint is that the biker ""babes"" in the movie were not accurate. Come on we all know biker babes are hot (my Mom is a biker babe) but the ones in the movie were - let's say, ""lacking"". Another non-intended comic point was the redneck bar scene. Charlie storms into a bar filled with ""the meanest rednecks you ever seen"" and they are all wearing pressed oxfords and loafers. But maybe that's the way rednecks dress in AZ? Charlie plays this multi-dimensional character very well. Overall, a good story well told."
5,I know Jack!,If you are a fan of great male vocals in the Sinatra style this is a great CD. I had forgotten had good he was until I saw him in person last month. I ran out and ordered every CD of his I could find. This is one of the best.
5,"Great, safe, gentle",This is good to use after you wash your skin. It will add moisture while toning and keeping gunk out. Smells great as well.
3,Dang,"Unfortunately I have to give this product 3 stars. After just a few days of using it I a big rash broke out on my face. I wanted to be sure that it was caused my the Witch Hazel so I stopped using it until they went away. Then, I started using it again and right away the big red rash came back. I've always had sensitive skin, so I suppose it's more my fault then the products. That's why I left it at 3 - for a neutral review."
5,Amazing!,"This is a wonderful toner. It moisturizes without drying, soothes sensitive skin, and the rose smell is delicious. It feels luxurious to apply in the morning to start the day, for a calming lift in the afternoon, or a relaxing way to prepare for sleep. A small amount goes a long way, so I've been surprised by how long a bottle lasts. I can't think of any way to improve this product."
5,Did you know...?,"Thayers Witch Hazel-Rose Petal alcohol-free toner can also be used to clean your makeup brushes. It contains some of the essential ingredients found in a popular makeup artist brand of brush cleaner...witch hazel (a cleansing ingredient) and grapefruit seed extract (known for it's antibacterial properties). What it doesn't have in common with the MA brand is alcohol, which is a very drying ingredient, both for the face and natural hair brushes. Try it; I think you will agree that this is a great multi-tasker product!"
1,IT LEAKS!,"I got this on02/21/2012. Removed the seal on the cap,the inner seal as well, then twist the cap back the normal way. I was disappointed to find out it leaks! Such an inconvenience!"
4,"Great product, bottle could stand some thought...","This is a great natural toner. The benefits of witch-hazel are detailed in many books and websites. This particular brand feels good going on, leaves my face feeling clean but not dry or tight. The rose scent, I could do without. For some reason, it feels a little above my years. Also, I find that if you squeeze the closed bottle (why you would, I don't know!) but the product leaks out around the edges of the closed cap. Makes me wonder if it's safe to toss in my bag when I travel... I just poured some into a smaller, tighter container, so I'm good to go!"
4,Refreshing,"Love this product!Although some people may be put off by the rose like smell, it gives my face a fresh clean hydrated feeling when used as a toner."
3,Old formula/ingredients,The bottle that I bought recently in a store was paraben free. The bottles available through Thayers website have different ingredients listed too. I'm not sure how old these bottle are but there's a better formula out there.
4,Wishbone Ash New England/Front Page News,"Wishbone Ash has always been known as a band with a loyal following, but no real hits. I liked their sound, and had ""Argus"" on vinyl. I do recommend ""Argus"", one of their best. But I liked ""New England"", and since I had to the chance to get two for one, why not. Some really good songs on ""New England"" and ""Front Page News"" also has good songs. If you like Wishbone Ash. You should get this classic two for one."
2,Not up to her usual standards.,"I wish SJ would go back to the writing style she built her career on! This book had none of the sexual tension that she built her career on. The story was ""blah"" too. I skimmed my way through the last third of the book. Another gripe I have is that they (either SJ or the publisher) seemed to have stretched the book out - printing it trade-sized to make it look weightier and then charging more for it. This is becoming a pet peeve of mine. I'm sorry to say that SJ is no longer an auto-buy for me. I'm going to have to wait and see what others say about her upcoming novels before I shell out my money."
1,lots of sex but no plot,"I really liked Susan Johnson's earlier novels, but lately she's been writing only the soft-porn and leaving out the plots and characterizations. And porn by itself just isn't enough [sort of like eating a whole chocolate pie for breakfast, I guess. You thought it would be fun, but it isn't.] This is another book to browse carefully BEFORE you buy."
1,Not for the easily-shocked,"I have never read a 'romance' like this before and I sure hope I never do again. It was vulgar, crude, and the 'hero' was the most repulsively selfish person I have ever met. He thought the worst of the woman he supposedly loved right the way to the end of the book and took pleasure in hurting her both physically through sex and emotionally. I have never seen the c and the f words used so freely in any book of any genre, and was appalled at what passed for a 'love' scene in this book. Defintely not for the squeamish or sensitive."
3,Lets be honest shall we.....,"I can't BELIEVE that someone reads Susan Johnsons books for theirs PLOTS. People PLEASE! Her books are about SEX new books old books its all the same...SEX. So if you are looking for plot, go read another author if you want sex..this book will do just fine. This was a quick read no thought needed, maybe got your blood flowing a little but not a bad book all in all. Its kind of like a one night stand...if you can remember the characters name at the end of the book you have done well."
2,An acquired taste.,"I won't say the writing was an all-around fail, because it wasn't. But this was simply bound not to be everyone's cup of tea. This book was too much about sex, not enough about love. There needs to be a balance.Normally, I love sex in a romance novel. I wouldn't want to read one witohut it. But with Simon and Caroline, it was all they ever did. They never communicated - they exchanged witty banter, and it was usually a prelude to sex. Simon didn't treat Caroline well, and he never showed an ounce of remourse for it. Then again, why should he? Caroline never held him accountable for anything. Ever. The mere thought of having Simon put his hands on her diminished any anger she harbored for him within seconds."
3,How many times can the woman use the word Dreamer????,"Answer, WAAAAAYYYY too many!!!!!I would have really liked this story except for that one word wich she used over and over and over again.........The characters and setting was good, but enough of that word already!!!!!"
1,*yawns...*,"I've tried Elizabeth Lowell before and couldn't get into her books. I got this book in a big collection of old books I bought. I tried this one, and at first I kind of liked Hope. But it got boring quickly. There wasn't enough to build the plot. I gave up at chapter four and just skimmed it until the end. Nothing exciting happens. When you have a plot as flat as this, you need to make up for it in other areas to make it more interesting. Lowell failed in that, which is why I stopped trying to like her books in the first place. She doesn't really write about emotion, or the questions inside someone's head...She doesn't do any of those pages where authors go deep into a character's mind and express their thoughts. Basically it's like just watching people doing things and speaking, but having no idea where their motivation is."
2,Pretty Predictable,"Predictable and REDUNDANT. The constant comparison of the hero to the wind gets old quickly. The author compares him to the wind, the heroine compares him to the wind and the hero compares himself to the wind on practically every page and midway through the book it had me rolling my eyes and seriously detracted from my enjoyment of this book. My advice is for you to get it from the library if you insist on reading it. One thing the author does well is give you a feel for the Nevada ranchland."
5,Favourite Book!,"'Beautiful Dreamer' is my all time favourite book, of any author, ever. It has everything I want from a novel - a strong, flawed hero, a fiery, independent heroine and a love story that makes me weep. There's nothing about this that I didn't like. Love, actually. Rio and Hope are beautifully matched and Elizabeth Lowell, as always, crafts a beautiful story that you want to read again and again."
3,I liked it until the gaskets gave up the ghost,"I used it for a couple years on my MSR fuel bottle. I liked it a lot, but now it's sitting on my work bench since the main gasket is cracked. Haven't gotten around to either buying a new one (since the original stopper works fine) or replacing the gasket (or gaskets, not sure if the internals are ok or not). Should at some point figure out if there are good replacements for the gaskets (maybe o-rings?), or if this means buying a complete replacement. If I get around to it doing the work, I'll update this."
4,A step up from Red Rider of old,"I first stumbled across this in a cut out bin, having never heard a song from it, having not even known it had been released. Lunatic Fringe had been a local radio favorite and I had waited for Neruda to hit the charts and take off, but to my great disappointment it had never happened. When I got his album home and listened to The Boy Inside The Man, I just knew it was destined for greatness, and played the song for anyone who would listen. Par for the course, it never got played on Cincinnati radio, which marks it as an instant classic elsewhere. If nothing else, following the career of Red Rider let me in early on the secret that Tom Cochrane was a genius. This album is the proof. The Boy Inside The Man is a classic on par with Lunatic Fringe and the rest of the album doesn't disappoint. Strong work. Stronger career."
3,Its climax seems to belong to another movie,"John LeTour (Willem Dafoe) is a recovered drug addict who spends his lonely life drifting around the city by night, delivering drugs for his boss, Ann (Susan Sarandon). He worries about his future, but he is firmly enmeshed in a lifestyle from which escape does not seem like a realistic option. A bit of hope creeps back into his life when he encounters an old flame (Dana Delany) from his days as a user and the possibility of rekindled romance becomes his lifeline. This is a very low-key film for most of its length, but its climactic explosion of violence provides a jarring change of pace that plays as if writer/director Paul Schrader couldn't figure out how to end the film. Delany's character is rather off-handedly changed from a figure with real dramatic purpose to a mere plot point that sets up the justification for a bloodbath. The performances are excellent and Schrader is a talented filmmaker, but he falters here./"
1,Plenty of action. Lifeless characters,"Phyllida and the brotherhood of Philander suffers by comparison with Georgette Heyer's historical romances, written between 1921 and 1972. Set in Regency England, Heyer ""created a world of manners and morals where laughter is a great corrective and healer"" (Jane Aiken Hodge, The private world of Georgette Heyer, 1984, profusely illustrated from Heyer's very extensive research files). Many have attempted to duplicate her work but few have succeeded, certainly Herendeen has failed. Her bisexual historical thriller plods along with many twists and turns. The characters seem lifeless. The language stilted. There is very little humor. Herendeen reveals a superficial awareness of Regency England's history, culture and fashion. I wondered about the names she gave her characters. They appear comically inappropriate or borrowed from Heyer. An inauspicious debut."
2,Trashy,"I thought Phyllida was too stupid to be believable, especially when presented as an very intelligent female. Also, No virginal Regency maiden would enter a marriage like that, unless forced. Even if she was attracted to her gay husband, an inexperienced female of that era would be far from titalated when observing her husband fondling other men. I have read plenty of gay fiction and Regency novels to feel comfortable in my opinion of this book."
3,boys,"I thought this movie was alright. I saw it one night while flipping through the channels. The ending kind of suck though, but everybody had good performances."
2,Nice but uneven toasting,"I bought this based on the good reviews the other modelAroma toaster had. Although this is a nice looking toasterand has nice features, I found that it toasts unevenly.If one side was medium the other was burnt. Or one sidewas medium and the other side was almost white. Why is itthey don't seem to be able to make toasters that toastboth sides evenly?"
5,One of the Very Best Charting Books Out There!!!,"This is by far one of the most well-written books I have seen in a long time. It keeps the reader's interest and makes learning the material fun. Even a 5th grader could work through this book and enjoy it. Best of all, charting works, especially when one looks at support and resistance, long-term support and resistance. The buy-and-hold approach goes out the window, once one looks at charts and observes their up-and-down behavior. A real value considering how many thousands it can save you in the markets. And these same analysis techniques apply to whatever one is trading, foreign exchange, options, stocks, whatever. A good sequel is to learn candlesticks (Steve Nison's books) to help predict reversals. No book is the holy grail, and charting is an art and not a science, but some books can help one make a lot of money and keep them from losing a lot of money. This is that type of book!"
5,So glad to find this on CD after 20 years with the LP,"This has long been one of my favorite albums. I purchased the record in the winter of 1984 during my freshman year in college just outside of Cleveland. Heard it on one of the true soul/R&B stations of the day, WZAK-93. The opening/title track, ""The Sound of Music"", is a really different fusion of mid 1970's mostly-instrumental disco hits (eg ""Fly Robin Fly"") and more contemporary 80's R&B-pop. But the entire album is exceptional with many songs strong enough to be singles in their own right. Polished, structured soul/pop songs with impeccable vocals and catchy but not cheesey hooks. I do NOT recommend paying $34.99 for this album as an import (ridiculous price!) though unless you really like this genre of music."
2,Al,"READ THE DESCRIPTION CAREFULLY! I did my homework and found that I wanted porcelain enameled CAST IRON grates and otherwise no frills with good quality. I have owned two other Weber 3 burner gas grills with cast iron grates and I liked them. I figured the enamel would make the cast iron last a lot longer. So this time I looked and saw that the Genesis grill was nice looking with everything I wanted but the Spirit was a lot cheaper. I compared the features and did not catch that the Genesis had porcelain enameled cast iron while the Spirit has porcelain enamel but not cast iron. I don't think the similar wording is an coincidence but shame on me for trusting Weber and not reading carefully. I know from past experience that the cast iron cooks a lot better. The grates I got look like junk that won't last past a season. I haven't used the new grill yet, but otherwise it looks OK."
3,Not to Bad,"This movie was okay, I really did not like the ending, not a bad one just not the kind I would have liked but overall the movie is okay. I thought Kim Fields looked absolutely beautiful in this movie, I think Brian White played his part ok. It could have been better but hey!!! it is what it is!!! I would say it is worth paying for"
4,running with metronome,Very helpful device to keep turnover consistant. My only issue is that even at low setting it is pretty loud. Recommend Chi Running book if you're not sure why a runner would need this.
2,Works good until the battery needs replacing,"I've had this product for about a year and it works well for my purpose; I use it for running and keeping my pace. However it needs to be better engineered when it comes to replacing the battery. The first time the battery went out I had to go to an auto parts store to purchase a phillips head screw driver small enough to get into the tiny holes and remove the tiny screws. I have a lot of very small screw drivers and none worked. No big deal, I now have a screw driver just to replace the battery. The next time the battery went dead, one of the tiny screws completey stripped and I am unable to remove it. I'll try to drill the head off and see if it will work with only two screws. However this is too much hassle to deal with each and every time I need to replace the battery. For this reason I will be looking to buy another brand of metronmone."
4,Great little metronome,"I bought this to help keep an even rhythm at the walk, trot, canter, and while jumping horses. It's loud enough to easily hear over wind, hoof beats, and high-blowing (a snorting sound some horses make in time to their breathing), and is easy to change to a different beat. It can easily be clipped on the rider's helmet or shirt--I would have given it 5 stars if the clip was stronger--it CAN come off (although it's rare) while jumping, or if a horse 'plays up'. I would really like to see this same metronome on a watch band. All-in-all, a very handy tool for either dressage or jumping."
3,Solid Pose Technique Product,"This item is great- I bought this for A CrossFit Endurance Cert and it works just fine.The only problem I have with it is it TURNS ON EASILY. Even when it's in my bag and I'm walking around, it will just turn on."
3,Battery change is a hassle,"The 3 tiny screws that you have to take off in order to change the battery are hard to reach. I managed to take one off but the second one was scrapped perhaps because the screwdriver did not go in exactly the perpendicular position. The third screw is even harder to reach because the clip is in the way. I will go somewhere to find a better tool, otherwise the device will be useless :-("
2,Very uncomfortable sound,"I feel that the metronome is ok for sport, but not good for piano player. The sound of the metronome is so sharp that really hurts my ears."
1,Annoying beep,"While a typical metronome is soothing and could almost lull one to sleep, this one is annoying and would wake everyone up with its beep.We bought this to help our daughter with piano practice. We gave it one listen, packaged it up, and returned it. The beep was that annoying. It isn't a tick or a melodious sound, but an abrasive beep.Do the other features of this metronome work well? Sorry, I couldn't tell you. Obviously, many others love it. But I wasn't about to subject myself to the noise just to write a review. The beep was a fatal flaw."
4,Great value delivered very quickly.,"I purchased the Metronome to pace me in my training for an uncoming 10K race.Under its ""tutelage"", I have decreased my time by 20% and am well ahead of where I need to beaccomplish my goal of finishing in the top ten per-cent of my over 70 age group.PS: My cat doesn't like it !"
2,Seiko DM50S,"Seiko DM50S doesn't perform--it's cheap, filmsy and whimsical. I would not recommend it. Pay a little more and get something more solid. Also hated that shipping cost me almost as much as the product."
4,Very unique take on vampire lore. Interesting,"Here's a DVD that really turns traditional vampire lore on its head. The female vampire vamps around in direct sunlight and enjoys traditional (and some very untraditional) sex with her victims before applying the fatal bite. And that stake in the heart that always annoyed Christopher Lee's Dracula...? Oh, no, that wouldn't do in this film. Vampire Analia Ivars gets staked...but not in the heart! Maybe the staking is director Jesus Franco's nod to vampire lore because the stake is applied where the sun doesn't shine! It's a funny short story shot on video with little budget but with a lot of imagination and gumption. The DVD has some fun extras too. I liked it."
4,Still Not Sure Why I Care,"With only four episodes left in the first season, I'm finding myself really reaching to find reasons why I want to see the final volume. The series has done its best to create fun characters that you want to see develop it something more than what they started as but they sure haven't made it easy. With only hints dropped in these twenty episodes, I am no closer to knowing what fate awaits Watanuki or even Doumeki than I did during episode one. With not even a cliff hanger to keep me interested, I don't imagine that I am going to go out of my way to watch the conclusion to xxxHolic season one."
2,Not what I expected,"This game was a major downfall compared to the two titles for the N64! These graphics are incredibly bad!Also, these tasks are basic! Only 2 tasks are actually hard! Last, this game is just horrible compared to THPS2! If u want an extreme game, I say, get Matt Hoffman or Dave Mirra!"
5,its good but not as good as smash bros.,"this is one of the best gammes ive ever played.its still not as good as smash bros,but there aint a game that is.you can be 12 skaters and there are 8 levels with nine missions on each.foundry,canada,rio.bamaer,airport, and three other levels.its cool.buy it."
3,Could be better,"This game is indeed fun... but when I was having difficulty completing the goals because of the games immense slowdown on some levels...If they port something over to a nexgen console, could they at least make it smooth? This gets incredibly slow, don't even try playing 2-player on it.. We quicky found out it goes TWICE as slow and its just a huge pain ..."
4,A solid playing experience.,"I love playing this game, so far it is my favoritetitle on the gamecube. The graphics are very nice thesoundtrack it excellent and the options are fantastic.Tons of bonus stuff and fantastic tricks.The only problem is I miss some of the songs fromTony Hawk 2, but it is no problem to turn the musicoff and listen to my own music, that is why I have a stereoafter all. This game is a classic."
5,sweet game,this game is a big improvement on tony hawk 2. It doesn't use the cash as a reward system. Instead of buying stats and decks u have to find them througout the levels. It is a really realistic game. A must have for game cube.
3,Not Good but not Bad,The graphics are good but the game doesn't let you grind as longer as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater on Play Station does.
1,this game [stinks],"this is the worst game of the tony hawk series. it is basically a skateboarding rpg because to find out your objectives you have to go talk to skaters. don't buy it, its a waste of the bling bling."
5,This baby is one helluva game!,"This game is amazing! The graphics are great, the control and motions are silky smooth, and you'll be playing it for hours-it's great fun, even though you may not like skateboarding. This is a must-get game! You'll regret it if you don't buy it!"
3,Informative with a scary slant,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a Catholic and I love my heavenly mother, but this guy is bonkers for Mary. It was downright scary the powers that he gives to her. It made me want to dis-believe in all the private revelations. I don't think Mary would smile on this one. However, there was lots of legendary information there."
5,An anti-American Eagle! How diabolical.,"The world is being held hostage by a cabal. They are threatening to change the weather if demands are not being met. All the top agents and teams have been sent to find and destroy them. Yet each has met with a fatal end.Cramden (Lee J. Cobb) the head of Zonal Organization World Intelligence Espionage (ZOWIE) has been charged with finding a solution. After placing all the requirements into a 1960's computer and card sorter, they all boil down to one. You guessed it the undisciplined multitalented Derek Flint (James Coburn).Can he save the world?He hands back the issued code book and prefers to use his own code which is a progression of 40-26-36. It is based on... well you can guess.Watch Coburn again in the same role but as a cowboy in ""Waterhole No. 3"" (1967)The President's Analyst ~ James Coburn"
3,The American James Bond,"Where James Bond needs all these gadgets to perform superhuman acts Flint usese ingenuity, and some neat gadgets. He's trying to stop Malcom Rodney a suave spy played tongue-in -cheek by the handsome Edward Mulhare. The movie is a little slow and somewhat cheesy but it is defintely the father of Austin Powers, if you like that 60's spy stuff. The confrontation between Flint and Rodney is a highlight along with the three mad scientists(in cluding the chinese scientist with the Jewish last name and the caucasin scientist with the chinese name)"
4,The reall austin powers,Great old films. I remember watching these on tv when I was way too young to understand the humor :-)
1,Not what it seems,"The CD cover shown in the ad is not the CD that you'll receive. I was actually looking for the Americans in Britain CD that features one of my wife's ancestors in it. I didn't realize what it was until it had shipped. It isn't bad for a classical music CD, but it isn't the Americans in Britain that is shown in the picture."
1,How many?,"Watch out this is the short list of classical music composers. Well there were a few more than that I wish to search for when I invest in a software package. I would not want this one for any in depth information about the lives of thousands of classical music composers. Why bother with this when I, or a youngster, can use google."
2,Rhapsody in August,"It was worth viewing for a few scenes; the ones with the grandmother interacting with her children and grandchildren in their home in the countryside near Nagasaki. Otherwise it was a very corny and navel gazing film. (Gere was the only actor in the film.) It was politically correct only from the Japanese point of view. Like postwar textbooks for the Japanese children there is never any other point of view than the Japanese' which has yet to address the global atrocities of the Japanese Imperial Army. Am I being insensitive if I ask whether as a civilian it was better to die during the rape of Nanking, internment in civilian prisoner of war camps run by Japanese, Nagasaki and Hiroshima nuclear bombing, Nazi pograms, starving in the countryside of enemy held countries, concentration camps? ....war is hell and I don't think it really matters to a civilian how they are murdered! The darker side of humanity reeks."
2,Relatively easy but not a solid foundation.,"This book made me realize something that I probably didn't before. That is that an applied approach is just simply skimming. That's what this book does, it skims over the concepts of Algebra. This is definitely not a solid foundation and will not benefit you if you need to take Trig., College Algebra or higher math. For instance, graphing is something you do alot in algebra. This book does not introduce the TI-84 calculator which is essential in today's algebra. I took an intermed. algebra course at one school under this book. Well a few years later I had to retake intermed. algebra because I placed low on the math test and was put back into it at another school. I was surprisingly shocked that I had learned very little with the applied approach. It was as if I was totally new to algebra. If your instructor requests this book for your algebra class, you will not finish that course with a strong enough foundation in intermediate algebra trust me."
5,a good book,I like this book very much. I wish I had this book as supplement reading when I took my cell biology. This book provides an alternative view and provokes many questions in modern cell biology. I highly recommend this book to senior undergraduate students and graduate students
4,Improving from where I stand now!,"All of us can stand some improvement in message formation and delivery, none of us are perfect...YET! Our improvement will be much smoother if we concentrate on the skills required to improve. In this book Wayne McDill reviews the skills we are most likely to drift away and become lax on. This book is an excellent reminder of the target we are to aim at."
2,Noisy,"My parents have one. On Easter I just had to ask:""What is that constant clicking noise""?Well, it's the Aerogarden. Over a few days later and reading the manual, trying to clean the (non-removable) pump out, but same problem.Also, I know they had it a month at least, but I couldn't begin to get enough basil to add to a vegetable dish I was making - woulda taken all off the plant.The tomato plant is taking over and everything else seems shadowed by it.But even if you could cook like crazy off it, I couldn't bear the noise."
3,not the right size for my Aero Garden,"I was disappointed in this kit. It says the seed pods and plastic holders will work with my Aero Garden but they are in fact too short to reach the water. I ended up removing the seed pods and putting them in the old, longer plastic holders and that worked. After I purchased this kit I bought the Master Gardeners deluxe kit which does not contain seeds. Just plastic holders, growing ""sponges"", and nutrient tabs. A much better choice as the parts actually work with my unit though I later found it would have been cheaper to buy it through the Aero Garden website (I purchased the Master Gardeners Deluxe kit directly from Amazon)."
5,great salad greens,"I am very happy with the chef pack, the salad greens are plentiful and I was able to pick which ones I wanted to start first and when these are done, I will plant the rest. I was happy to see the leaves are large not small and wimpy."
3,Not very mixed greens,"Like all aero products, it works just fine. Not satisfied with the greens it produces - they are all the same despite the descriptions. I do like being able to take a leaf hear and there and not have to buy a whole head of lettuce and waste it. Takes more tending than the herb garden... leaves seem to get on the grow surface and adhere, then die. Not a big fan of this kit."
2,Doesn't produce with 2 foot aerogarden,"Don't buy the cherry tomato seed kit unless you own the newer, higher aerogarden!I own the ""standard"" Aerogarden. This version has a maximum distance of about two feet from pods to lights. I had previously had a great experience growing the herbs. The tomatoes just needed a lot more headroom that my aerogarden provided. My harvest was a meager eight (if great-tasting) cherry tomatoes. I've noticed that since my experience, Aerogarden has introduced a new version with a four foot headroom. I think the tomato seed kit should be clearly labelled as requiring the four foot version!Also, make certain to read the directions--you'll need to pollinate the tomato flowers by hand, which is a straightforward process that is clearly described.I'm now planting another round of herbs."
4,"Finally, A visual outlook on Fibromyalgia!","When I first saw this I was so emotionally overwhelmed in such a postive way though! There were tears,laughter, and relief cause I felt like ""YES"" a film on this and people with it saying almost everything I go through and want to say as well to people who are not ""aware"" at all, or just ""don't"" want to be aware or educated about Fibromyalgia.What I liked best was the variety of ages,genders and races of people that interviewed and shown that have fibromyalgia to break the stereo type that only women over 40 get fibro, and the visual aspect of the symptoms of fibro. The realistic and positive outlook on living with it and showing people laying down on the bed and couch because their just so fatigued or in so much pain, it's all they can do. At the same time showing how strong in mind and their positive attitudes it shows that in spite of having fibromyalgia were survivors!!I would recommend this to a friend and family members, etc."
3,Expected More,"I was a bit disappointed with this item. It didn't offer enough medical advice and it centered on several people that I truly didn't have much in common with even though I have fibromyalgia. I'm not a medical student, actress/model, or drag racer. I really expected to relate more to the people that were going to be in the movie. I wanted my family to watch it and know what I feel like on ""bad days"". I suppose it would be good to watch for someone that has just been diagnosed."
4,Very nice bedding but....,"After searching for a nursery theme for my daughter, I chose the Tuscany because I am not a pink person. The really like the bedding, but I am having to do some remodeling in my house and trying to come up with good ideas to decorate my daughters new room is basically impossible because this bedding has no decor. I have researched Lambs and Ivy and Babies R us with no success. Was told that Tuscany was made just for BRU and no other store carries it. It is very hard to find anything that will match this bedding. Wish I would have looked a little longer and investigated decoration possibilities before I bought this."
3,Not so stunning...,"In all seriousness this book isn't really that ingenious. Everything that's in this book revolves around the advantages and disadvantages of your ""reception location"". Although it does provide some good advice, it's quite lackluster. I went off the reviews of this book and I'm not impressed.I must mention that I'm an artistic & strong minded person who knows what she likes. For those of us who have a clear idea of their reception, skip the book, it's not worth the money.If you have no idea how or what you want your reception to be like, this book will most likely come in helpful. It has the run down on the ""typical"" types of wedding reception locations. I stress the word typical. It does not include reception/banquet halls whatsoever.Even if you fall into the catagory above, I strongly recommend you save your hard earned cash for something actually useful."
3,Fairly stunning,"This book is good for the gorgeous photos. It tells you how to make your wedding look great in different kinds of venues (ie. hotel, tent, barn, etc.). This book should not be used as a wedding planning tool--it's not that."
4,So wonderfully fantastic!,"Unique, touching, and beautifully done. Thank you. Most movies that deal with bullying have to be so dark and violent. This was artistic and touching. I want to share this movie with my students! :)"
4,Not typical of most people's childhood.,"Like the boy portrayed in the movie, I was also a kid in the 1960's. I liked the way that the story was consistent with reality at that time. Like one piece front seats. The movie showed how some of the kids eventually went on to become writers, parents and convicted felon (of course your daily decisions factor a lot in your destiny.) I think the movie shows that everyone was made for a different destiny and purpose. I rented this movie and it was enough. It is not worth the full price that amazon is asking for it. I would consider a purchase at six dollars. No more. I don't think this movie is of course representative of everyone's childhood. Some kids have never been to school dances or the prom. If there is a book out there that this movie is based on, then I would surely like to read it."
2,it was ok,this movie was incredibly boring and it wasnt a good movie for my grand son and myself to watch i dont recomend it
5,Awesome shield,"We LOVE this weather shield. We take our kids running several days a week and in cold or wet weather, we have used our shield many times. They love going with us and we still get in our run."
2,One of Sierra's Lowlights,"Critics loved the first Police Quest (back in 1987) because it seemed to capture police work better than any other game before it. It did; you had to do things by the book or you lost the game, period. These games weren't as fond of violence as the King's Quest series (why was that marketed to kids, anyway?), and usually achieved their primary goal.The writing, though, was atrocious; the plots were fairly dull and formulaic (save for PQ2, which was only formulaic) and the games had almost no replayability. The series as a whole hit its nadir with Police Quest 4, a project embarrassingly used by former LAPD chief Daryl Gates as a way of demeaning the press and defending his own scattershot record.Yech. For story, go for Space Quest or Quest for Glory; if you can find them, the Conquest titles (Camelot and Longbow, the latter featuring Robin Hood) are terrific, much better than this series."
5,BLACK COMEDY AT ITS VERY BEST,"EATING RAOUL is a Screamingly funny film,if one likes black comedy. This has to be one of the most bizarre movies made and I loved it. It may be old, but it is one of the best of this type that has been produced!"
5,Raoul doesn't eat it!,The Criterion edition has a significantly better picture than the previous dvd release. The extras are informative and amusing. It's a shame Paul Bartel isn't around to see the love bestowed upon his child.
1,"Movie 5 stars, DVD 0 stars","The DVD version forces the film into the widescreen 1:1.85 format. The original was almost certainly shot in 1:1.33, 1:1.66 at most. This has the effect of compressing the image and making everyone appears shorter. This is a VERY annoying feature.Still, the movie itself is a cult masterpiece."
4,Dark dark humor...,"If you've ever wanted to see a movie where someone almost drowns in a toilet bowl (and really, who doesn't?), than this is the flick for you. Mary Woronov and Paul Bartel play would-be restaurant owners, the Blands, who find out that they can finance their dream bistro by offing perverts with a frying pan and robbing them. Wonderfully dark, sadistic and hilarious movie."
3,Funny and Strange,"The first time I saw this film was back in the 90's. I thought it was funny, albeit redundant. After perusing it again nearly twenty years later, I still enjoy it, but would love to see a remake of it, where the murder weapons are varied and the nudity is reduced. I thought it distracted from the story, nor was the situation that led to the female lead's affair realistic. In fact, it probably wouldn't fly today.Overall, it is an off-beat comedy with enough twists to keep your interest."
3,OK I guess....,"Has some marginally interesting tidbits, but on the whole I'd rather see more maps, diagrams of the Hold and Weyr layouts, etc. A lot of the stuff covered here is already covered in ""Dragonsdawn"" and in other similar short stories. I did enjoy the short story on F'lessan, although having read ""The Littlest Dragonboy"" already, the novelty of the idea of Impression is diminished. Why not write on something different?And what is with some of the portraits throughout the book? Menolly looks downright goofy, Jaxom looks....WEIRD.... and Lessa looks kinda gaunt. There are several other drawings of ""anonymous"" people that are much better, what gives!"
4,Truly CREEPY,"Listening to this CD I can't help thinking how much more enjoyable Hellraiser might have been if Coil had been allowed to do the soundtrack. It would definitely have made a much bolder statement during a time (the mid-80s) when soundtracks were dominated by weepy, John Williams-like violins or simply horrible bubble-gummy songs (think Katrina & the Waves...)."
5,The CD is called Afterglow NOT Appendix,A collection of Crowded House Rarities & B-Sides which spans over the 10 year duration of the band. Most tracks come for the turmoil ridden times before the amazing woodface CD. Tracks are studio fresh and full of melodies which will work their way into the cracks of your everyday life.
2,Their First Lousy record,"This was the first REALLY LOUSY record by the Cocteau Twins, and a portent of what was to follow. The guitarist was messed up on heroin at the time, and the whole record has this fuzzy distant zombie feel to it.The compositions are dreary, the arrangements are mediocre, the mixing sounds like it's being done through cotton balls. The only redeeming quality is the title track. The rest of it is useless.After this fiasco, they had a few nice moments in Heaven to Las Vegas, and Kisses. Almost everything prior to this record is utterly amazing, with the possible exception of Garlands, which suffered from their style not being complete and having a different bass player.Avoid this one. Get Treasure or (if you can find it) Pink Opaque or if you insist on bliss- victorialand."
4,Good way to get introduced to Pendragon,"Pendragon is a band mainly popular in Europe and not many here in the USA are familiar with them. I was looking for something new to add to my collection and listened to ""listen"" box next to the songs. I liked their sound and decided to pursue this band. I was already familiar with the album ""Window of Life"" and liked it very much. They are considered a neo prog band. So I got the video to see them in action. Since then they have come out with other videos and I'm sure they sound better due to better technology now. That's why I didn't give it 5 stars. The sound is OK, but their stage presence and watching them play the songs was worth buying the disc. It is also filmed in Poland and it is fun to watch how different the audience over there is compared to here. It is very reasonably priced to if you want to hear their older compositios it's worth taking a look ( and a listen). Great songs."
4,"Son loves it, but for only 12 episodes, it's expensive",My son loves this so I bought it for him. I thought it was two whole seasons of Sonic X. But instead it's 12 episodes; six episodes on each DVD. If I had known it was so little for so much money I probably wouldn't have bought it. He is happy though.
2,OK,"Like the toaster for where it fits, toasts unevenly. One side is much darker than the other. Makes good breakfast waffles on defrost!"
3,Fun,"This game is really good I just got my copy yesterday and I am very impressed even if it is a remake of the old ones. The only thing that really bugged me is that the wireless link cable takes up a lot of room and it only has a 10 feet radius. So it dosent go very far and theres really no point in the whole chat thing which by the way is really dumb because you have to hit every individual letter, talk about a long conversation. Also why whould they have chat I mean the person in ten feet away there is no need for it unless you are deaf. And then there is the whole like 50 people in the union room so there would be 50 people standing 10 feet away from eachother. The wireless cable was a good idea but unless you can walk and play your gameboy at the same time then you probobly wont like it. It needs to have a bigger radius."
5,season six great,"This one was also a gift. My son love both of the Dragon Ball Z, this is his favor of the Dragonball. I will do what I can to get them all for him because he loves them so much, and this season he really like as well as season 7. Thank you so much for having this 2 season they were the perect Christmas presant for our son."
4,Not The Best........,"..........quite! How could it be without ""One Long Day"" on it? [That is on their self titled first album which to me is their best.] For those looking for the best of Cold Chisel, try also to get the ""You're 16....."" EP with songs from this vintage plus ""Wild Thing."" Hard to get though."
5,The best book on the history of bassets,"The emphasis of this book is a historical record of the best basset bloodlines in the US and offers wonderful photos of top bassets. An excellent reference tool for anyone who really wants to know what bassets are SUPPOSED to look like (not those pathetic examples in most calendars you buy at Borders)..proper structure and pay close attention to the AKC standard....If you own a basset...check your pedigrees...if you have a well bred dogs, there will be names in this book you'll recognize.Pricey for the average person, but should be a reference tool for anyone serious about bassets."
5,just my favorite,"I consider myself as a more than moderated Tull fan. I have nearly all their albums and if I had to choose just one of them (""best of"" ones included) I would choose this one. I could write lots of lines about it, trying to describe it's beauty and Ian's autstanding sense of musicanship here, but my english is not very good and the only thing that I can say is ""listen to it""."
5,Michele's smooth vocals will make you believe in romance!,This beautiful and powerful debut album should not be missed. In a flawless performance blending jazz with a touch of Gospel Michele gives a stunning performance. If you appreciate the great JAzz vocalists you will love Michele.
1,Nice leather - Weak snaps,"Although the leather is thick, and this appears to be nicely made, the snaps are weak. Not only will the pouch open up, to expose the lighter to loss, but the belt loop snap is loose. I've dropped this off my belt 3 times already. Luckily I have found it each time. Now I have used Lock-Tite to close the belt loop snap. But I don't have a solution for the puch snap yet."
4,great,"This book has been a good one for my 2 year old. It has some nice pics of baby in mommies belly which at least helps my son articulate that his baby brother is on mommies belly--not that he really gets it, yet!"
2,Inappropriate content,"I bought this book for my 21 month old child. Although this book is rated for baby-preschool, I consider it too graphic overall because it discusses the egg & sperm & fertilization (with pictures)."
5,Very good book,"I was hoping to prepare my toddler who is 19 months old for a new baby coming. When I first received the book, I thought it was too difficult and long for him. So, we started making up the story based on the pictures on each page. But gradually, we began reading the actual words of the book and he's fine with it. I like it that the pictures even show the baby in mommy's tummy, how it's growing and mommy breastfeeding. I find it a very complete book in preparing my son for the coming baby. From doctor's visits, taking outinfant clothes, granny coming to stay and help, toddler visiting the hospital and holding new baby. bringing new baby home, breastfeeding, giving a bath and dressing to calming the crying new baby, I say the book's pretty much complete. Excellent buy!"
5,Outstanding Source for Double Stars Observations,"I would recommend this book to anyone interested in studying double stars. Not only does it provide some history on the study of doubles going back 100's of years, but it brings you up to date with the lastest information and methods for measuring double stars."
1,"I cannot, for the life of me, get these speakers to work.","I can only get 2-channel sound in 4-channel mode. That is it. I do not get any surround sound, I don't get a test tone (only static), nothing. The only Dolby option I can activate is Prologic, not DTS, which doesn't matter because I don't get sound anyway! I have checked and rechecked every connection, tried every wire combination known to man, tried two different sound cards with Dolby encoding, AND NOTHING HAPPENS. I have never been able to get these speakers to work, and I have not been able to find any information anywhere that addresses the issue. Maybe that speaks well for this system that I can't find anybody else who's had the problem, but I'm about ready to toss these things out the window, I'm so frustrated. I JUST WANT SOME DECENT SOUND!! If I'd wanted tinny, no-bass 2-channel sound, I would've bought a set of $15 Logitechs and been done with it."
1,Konk'd out.....,"When it worked, this thing was pretty nice. However, i got the same problems as some others. First they said they lost my rebate and there was really no way to contact them. Second, this thing died on me! The main unit doesn't work any more - although the headphone jack still works - that's about it! I'm gonna avoid all yamaha speakers from now on."
2,Won't let me add to cart...,"Well, i was first of all very interested in this product, and i still am, but i would have purchased it a long time ago if Amazon.com would have fixed an error with this page. When i try to add this speaker system to my shopping cart, it just sends me to a page which tells me that my shopping cart is empty. I have e-mailed Amazon.com twice, and called once (the representative said they were aware of this problem and would have it fixed shortly), and it still hasn't been fixed.... weeks later. I noticed today that the price has dropped another 15 dollars, and i still can't buy it. I'm getting aggrivated. I would add a lot more stars if i could actually purchase the thing."
4,good buy,"I bought this cart to use for a table top bbq grill. works great, was easy to assemble. would recommend."
3,A Picture Book,"Since there is no description of this book, yet the Used Book prices are so high, I thought to write a little review/description to let you know about this book. The 3 star rating is not to say the book is great or bad, I merely picked a middle number as the review interface demands I do so.I stumbled across its title ""A Mendocino Year"" under the category of Mendocino memoir. In a way it is a memoir, without text though. Small drawings of local produce, animals, birds, and life within the Mendocino landscape are what make up this memoir, organized by months of the year. For example, January: Drawings by Ms. Russell of what January in Mendocino meant to her that year: a pony, stacks of firewood, a seed catalog, a wood burning stove.Clever it tells the sweet story of one year in the remote beauty of Mendocino, but if you are looking for a classic text memoir of a resident's experience in this area, this is not that kind of book."
2,A Techno-Flop,"Florent Pagny is a great singer. Nobody denies his talent. So what's the use of rehashing other's songs with that stupid, inappropriate and trendy techno sound as background ? A sheer disappointment."
5,Wrong movie delivered.,"I had high hopes for this film due to the fact that actor Ronn(Juan)Castro was in the cast. Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to review the film because the wrong movie was delivered. Stay tuned, I may find another source from which to buy the movie. At that time, I will gladly present my opinion.."
2,OVERRATED,THE PREVIEWS FROM THE WERE MOVIE OVERRATED IT MORE THAN IT SHOULD HAD BEEN. I ALMOST FELL ASLEEP ON THE MOVIE A COUPLE OF TIMES. I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE NONE STOP ACTION BUT IT WAS JUST LIKE A TYPICAL MOVIE LIKE SUM OF ALL FEARS OR DEEP IMPACT. IT WAS ALOT OF TALKING AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT THE ACTION IS OVER AND BACK TO TALKING AGAIN. I WOULD GO SEE IT IN THE MOVIES OR RENT IT BECAUSE ITS NOT WORTH YOU BUYING IT. ONCE YOU SEE IT ONCE THERE IS NO NEED TO SEE IT AGAIN SO PLEASE DONT WASTE YOU MONEY ON THSI MOVIE.
3,The Day After Tomorrow,"I'd give this mixed reviews. If you like weather catastrophy, you'll love it! And it also showed some things in it I thought wern't neccessary. The beginning goes by very fast and then goes real slow. I would say go see it if you like weather and don't mind some unecessary footage. It was pretty good, all in all."
2,Pretty dumb plot,"Before I start, let me just say that this is a negative review, and it seems to me that a majority of people do not find negative reviews helpful for some reason...maybe they only want to read positive reviews, as they've basically made up their minds to buy the movie or book.To start, save your money and rent this if you haven't seen it. There were some good scenes and special effects, but the movie goes wrong with its focus on Sam and his dad.Sam's dad starts out from Washington, in a blizzard, to go to New York to save Sam, and ends up walking the last 40 miles to get there. Yep, only Sam's dad can save him, not the cops, not the army, only superhero dad...And, did Sam's dad bring an extra snowsuit for Sam to make the trip back in? No.And why should we care about Sam anyway? People are dying in New York left, right, and centre, but as long as Sam makes it back you are supposed to feel good.As for the reviewer who watched this 4 times already, you must be kidding. Once is enough."
5,P & T Bears,"I never get tired of watching this movie, I really love it. Now it's even better on Blu-ray, I am glued to my seat with my mouth open waiting for the next event, after all, I've only seen it 5 times already!"
2,limp,"Apparently 125 million is not enough cash to produce a good,loud,epic disaster film these days.It can produce a dull and predictable flop that has characters you would not give a monkeys butt about,about 8 minutes of destruction footage TOTAL! And those few moments you dont get to see hardly any one getting killed,they cut away from it or dont show it at all.This is fine for something like a violent action flim,it leaves more to the imagination,but not in a friggin world wide disater film!I guess this is what disaster films after 9/11 are going to be like,gutless and fearfull to show anything,forgetting the fact its only a movie. And why must every damn film like this take place in new york,its getting old fast."
2,Really Boring and Very Unbelievable...,"Having enjoyed some really great disaster movies in the past: ""The Airport Series"", ""The Posieden Adventure"", ""The Towering Inferno"", I was eager to see this one. But about 30 minutes into the movie, I became bored and after about an hour, I was fast forwarding the DVD trying to get to something good.The special effects were sophomoric, the characters flat, and the ending was a welcome relief. With stars like Dennis Quaid, Sela Ward, and Jake Gyllenhaal, I had hopes that the acting would be good. I was wrong. Their performances were one-dimensional and predictable.They wasted a lot of money and talent on this dud. Pass on this one."
3,The Day After Tomorrow,"This is a fun movie. I loved the special effects and the acting but the ending was a little weak.I recomment watching this movie on a Friday night with a bag of popcorn, some Milkduds and a soda.It's what I watch a movie for. People take movies way to seriously for my tastes, because if it ain't fun, what's the use."
3,"Great special effects, that's all.","This movie was only watchable for the special effects, and maybe for the acting talents of Ian Holm, and Emmy Rossum. This movie has a lame story and script that has you waiting painfully for the big storm to happen, and after it happens, the movie leaves you cold. There is nothing that makes you want to care for the people in this movie, or what happens to the world after the Global Warming incident. The whole love story between Jake and Emmy was just dumb, and should've never been in here in the first place, along with the lukemia kid.If you really want to see this movie, then just rent the dvd and fast-foward an hour into the movie if you want to be satisfied."
1,worst movie ever,"I feel a bit like comic book guy from the simpsons writing this review, but really the movie had plot holes big enough to cover the distance from washington d.c. to philidelphia (which appearently you can traverse most of that distance on foot). Seeing this movie I seriously began to believe the world might come to an end, not from global warming but from an economy crashing because of millions of dollars being spent on horrible movies (ed wood must be rolling over in his grave for not recieving an oscar for plan 9). But please, I beg you, if you are to purchase this movie you will be contributing to the decline of western civilization, and could very well assist in the crash of global economies and who knows, maybe it would cause wolves to chew their way through metal fences to escape from zoos. Terribly unacceptable portrayal of an intelligent societies reaction to nature. Worst movie ever!"
4,I liked it..,and saw this twice. The critics panned this movie but I thought it was pretty good. The ending was open and I think this confussed the critics.
1,Unwatchable,"Usually with my expectations lowered, based on the bad reviews on IMDB, I can enjoy movies like this. Not this time. The movie has nice disaster special effects, but the story is terrible. It was so bad that I turned it off after an hour.There is nothing worthwhile to enjoy. Forget about the poor science, its just a painfully bad movie."
3,Important Correction,"B. Souter (canberra, ACT Australia) wrote in his review:""The reviewer who thinks the US govt shoudlnt be criticised probably forgets the US is supposed to be a liberal democracy....and that criticism is a necessary feature of a democracy.""For his information as well as the information of others who may be confused about this,the United States is NOT and never has been a democracy,liberal or otherwise. What we are and always have been is a Constitutional Republic. Any of you who think this is minor nitpicking need to investigate the difference between the two.BTW,I haven't viewed the movie. I rated it at 3 stars so as to not be unfair to it when posting this correction."
1,Yeech,I'll not even comment on the absurd activist nature of this movie. I'll just ask one question. If these kids are so darned smart...why do they burn irreplacable BOOKS when surrounded by tons of wooden furniture??
2,Environmentalist BS,It was environmentalist BS plain and simple. See this movie if you want to see a load of liberal crap.Not to mention it was just a bad movie. Very poorly done.
4,loved the movie but...,"You will like it if you're into escapist films like the directors previous work. Special effects were great, but the wolf CGI was flat out terrible. Dialogue corny, but i loved the movieNOTE TO MOVIEMAKERS, I DO NOT WANT TO WATCH ANOTHER MOVIE THAT TAKES PLACE ON THE EAST COAST OR WEST COAST. WHY DO ALL MOVIES TAKE PLACE IN NEW YORK, AND WHY DO ALL SONGS TALK ABOUT CALIFORNIA?I'm from Chicago and the only time chicago is mentioned is when a side character has to move or he has buisness there.(...)"
2,Disappointment,"When I first saw the commercials, I thought the movie would be great. It was an OK movie, but it didn't at all reach my expectations of what I thought it would be.The part that really ruined it for me was the wolves. I mean, come on. Wolves won't suddenly become savage beasts roaming through the cities, attempting to eat people."
4,"Stock up on Bread, Milk, and Toilet Paper","I doubt the science in this movie lines up like they say it does, but it is still a great story about survival and how you can count on human nature in dire situations. I love movies that make you think about what can happen to our civilization. We try to control so much, and it's nice to be reminded sometimes that we don't have all of the answers!"
4,You be the Judge,"All I have to say is that I loved this movie. Did I believe any of it, no, but there's the problem with the negative reviews... people don't know a popcorn movie even if it hit them right in the face. Anyhow, I love popcorn movies. Movies like this is what keeps me going to the movies. Money well spent."
3,Blu- Ray picture & sound is very good.....,maybe a little too good as it aplifies the fact the screenplay and acting is a bit on the weak side.....Well worth the cost as i got it when they were BOGO free....
4,It certainly had me wondering...,"""Can it really happen?""""What should we do to prevent this?""""Oh my god...I'm scared!""It was comments like these that filled the movie theatre directly after the movie. Well, all I can say is that ""The Day After Tomorrow"" certainly had me wondering...""Is this really going to happen?""Better-than-decent-yet-still-not-perfect acting and a solid orchestral score gave this movie a sort-of atmospheric feeling. When you get into the theatre (or watch the movie on a giant flat-screen TV, etc.) and you first hear the thunder on the FOX entertainment logo (it has to be through surround sound to give you that real excited feeling), you will almost surely know that this movie will not disappoint. I liked how the special effects looked almost real...that is, almost.Dennis Quaid did a fine job acting, and the guy who played his son was a great actor as well. I'm definitely going to be buying this on DVD."
2,Corny Movie that was on the verge of being Boring!,"I didn't expect much going in (Emmerich Film!), but I at least expected to be entertained and entranced by the special effects. In truth, all the SFX you see on the previews are what you see when watching the movie. The only difference being you have to sit through a long....two hours of horrendously written mumbo-jumbo talk and bad acting (people in the theater were actually laughing at the actors everytime they said something stupid, which was practically in every scene). The only reason for two stars is that the effects are pretty good and look epic on the big screen. If I were you I would wait to rent this on Dvd. I'm not usually harsh on movies and rarely give them lower than three stars, but this no-brain stinker deserves it."
3,GIVE ME A BREAK,"Escapist nonbelievable viewing. Why does everybody act stupid and panic in these movies? And why do all the experts die on the way to the rescue? Give me a break. But, suspend your thought process for a couple of hours and it is escapist viewing."
2,All Hype - No Story,"""The Day After Tomorrow"" is one of those movies that can be rated as worth seeing, as long as nothing else of importance is going on. This movie takes a big-budget, special-effects-filled look at what the world would look like if the greenhouse effect and global warming continued at such levels that they resulted in worldwide catastrophe and disaster, including multiple hurricanes, tornadoes, tidal waves, floods and the beginning of the next Ice Age. The acting was sub-par, at best."
3,"Viva Las Mexico, but in the meantime...","I'd have to say its okay to stay where you are. Do not panic or board up your windows.After just recently viewing The Day After Tomorrow, I must express my concern of the audience they were trying to reach out to. Certainly there is a good chance that this movie could have had some small lasting effect on your attitude towards environment, but before you lock up your car and whip out your bike consider the following. One single volcano can whip out more green house gases than all the cars IN THE WORLD in a single year, I would site my sources but I'd rather have you take my word for it.Overall, I thought the action gets four stars, the drama maybe three, the graphics get a five, but the best is the comic relief it gets a definate five. Not a bad movie but they could have done their homework before blaming it our modern day life style."
3,Cable-movie or Movie of the Week Quality only,"This movie would have been just as good as a Sci-Fi channel movie or movie of the week on one of the networks. I thought Dennis Quaid gave a credible performance, but the material was seriously lacking. During the movie the characters try to explain why the events are occurring and then can't explain why they are occurring at this time. That line of thought just seems to fall apart in the movie. Having said that, disaster movies of this type are difficult to make, although I would have expected more from Emmerich. It's worth renting on video."
3,It's just weather,It wasn't really a good movie. All is has is a buch of shot of weather disaster made by computers. but had some good actions scenes.
2,"Every disaster film has to ""up the ante"".","This one gets an extra half star because they have enough money & the special effects on these disaster movies (will they ever end?) does keep getting better. In the past, we have seen the White House blow up, the Emplre State Building incinerate & the Statue of Liberty beached. In real life we all saw The WTC disiintegrate before our very eyes on 9/11. This time the Statue of Lberty is up to her neck in ice. It's a new ice age. The vice president is the viilian, evil, wrong & as scary as he is in real life, along with his side-kick George the Dim. Actually, the president in the movie is more of a wimp than our real president. But he is just as stupid. This ice age will cover most of the northern hemisphere. So we all pack up & head south for Mexico. They greet us with open arms... just like we welcome their citizens traveling north today in real life. Right. 21/2 stars"
3,A 5-Star effects movie but a 3 star film.,"Independence Day and Godzilla were both silly blockbuster fun and THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is something the same, but with a little less spectacle. However after the initial tornadoes and massive tidal wave engulfing New York, the film loses momentum and some rather bad acting comes to the fore. Jake Gyllenhaal seems to be channeling Tobey Maguire, and the rest of the ensemble cast don't hold up to well. There is something really real and quite haunting about seeing a possible future displayed so vividly, but the whole excercise looses realism when the silly comic book ice-chasing-people rubbish starts. Add a nauseating layer of cheese (especially near the end), and you've got a distinctly shaky movie. Roland Emmerich isn't much with storytelling, but the CGI is admit impressive.A 5-Star effects movie but a 3 star film."
2,"Saw it twice, and that was enough.","Nice multiple storylines, people you could almost care about (The homeless guy and his dog were the best) but still left the film with the feeling that I didn't get my money's worth. Oh well."
2,This was stupid,This was a multi-million dollar movie that boiled down to a bad joke about Mexico closing it's borders to the United States. Ha ha ha.
1,"Great Effects, Terrible Writing & Blah Acting","It's a shame that the talents of Jake Gyllenhal, Emmy Rossum and others were wasted on this tripe. The special effects are breathtaking but the writing quickly devolves into worse-than-generic disaster talk. Even taken with a grain of salt, this movie is a definite PASS. It's 2 hours of your life that you'll never get back."
1,Don't Bother,"I wish I would have read the other one-star reviews. While this guide may have been a good (if not great one) at another time, the photos are outdated (I mean, rolled bangs?)which says, to me, that the information could be outdated. Some of the poses look hokey. The author should update the book."
3,"You get what you pay for, and that's not bad.","The other reviewer is right in a sense that these DON'T feel like high quality sunglasses. That's because they don't carry a price tag of over ten dollars. They are decent sunglasses that do what they're supposed to do (shade your eyes from the sun....), while looking similar to Neo's glasses in the movie, although they made me look a little bug-eyed. They are very feeble, and mine didn't come in perfect condition either (slightly, not enough to warrant me bothering to send it back), but they shipped fast (standard delivery and I got it in 2 days) and are quiet comfortable. If you're looking for high quality durable perfect condition sunglasses, then look somewhere else. Otherwise, if you can spare 10 bucks and always treat your stuff with the utmost care, then give these a shot."
2,Bloob-bloob-huumm-girgle-whoosh,"Vocaless girgles from the best atmosphere artists. At first I really did not like this album, but it grew on me. I still believe that it pales in comparison to more accesible works a la _Love's Secret Domain_ (I'm a sucker for pop, what can I say?). Even so, Coil makes some of the best and often most distrubing atmospheric ditties. This album is a bit DRONE heavy (not to my personal liking--hence the low stars) and not terribly experimental (as they are known for). If you know coil, then you know what kind of album this would be. If you are new to them, don't begin here. Try *Unnatural History* or *Love's Secret Domain* and work into this mystifying stuff . . . ."
2,Buy it only if you own most of thier other albums,"This album isn't very good at all, probably Coil's worst album, sounds closest to Scatology, and nothing like Musick To Play In The Dark, I wouldn't prefer it unless you are a die hard fan, collector, or are just rich."
3,Too many twists and turns,"The story revolves around secret religious documents that were hidden from the Germans during WWII.This book started out great. However, as the book progressed there were just too many plot twists and extra characters. I don't mind plot twists but after a while the story was so complex that it was totally unbelievable."
3,Interesting and informative,"First and foremost, the book is a diary and it represents a self review by the author. Apparently there is is also a great deal of classified information the author could not put into the book that could have provided some deeper understanding of what that life is all about. Titan Tales serves as a good reference source."
1,i was on a crew with womack,"if this is the major womack that i'm thinking of, i was on a crew with him. i wouldn't buy the book as i wouldn't want to advantage him in any way as i thought that he was a jerk."
2,don't stay up,My daughter received these for Halloween with pink ranger costume. Unfortunately they do not have a strap at the top to keep them from falling down and obviously they are not skin tight. Basically useless to walk around in. They are not boots but coverings over shoes that do not have any way of standing up like shown in the picture. Bummer..
2,Where's the real good stuff?,"I bought this DVD hoping to recapture the 50's ""Paar"" experience. It didn't happen. Some short segments are very entertaining - but there aint' enough of em! Where, Oh Where, are Charlie Weaver, Genvieve, Dodie Goodman, Hans Conried, Hermione Gingold, Jack Douglas and his charming Japanese wife, Rieko? These were the ""Regulars"" we tuned in nightly to see interact with Jack. Jack himself would be disappointed. You 50's folks, think twice about buying this superficial compilation."
1,AWFUL!,"Coil's own description of this album helps underscore its abject inferiority to their other works: It is composed of ""discarded shards, distortions, disappointments"" and ""remnants of what once was.""This is a woeful piece of work--a lopsided mish-mash of incongruous and uninventive jaunts.STAY AWAY FROM THIS TRASH!"
3,okay...,This was one of those books that is good if you are going on a long trip...or busy watching kids by the pool...not really a book that will keep you up at night...
1,ILLUSTRATIONS PLEASE,The document would be much more usefull if the referenced illustrations were included.
4,GOOD BUT NOT the BEST THEY HAVE,"Well I enjoyed this dvd to a point, but I think the over use of the orchestra took something away from the edginess of these guys.I am a big scorpions fan first seeing them in 1978 at Chicago fest and as such would have liked to see some of their older stuff played. I still enjoyed this dvd and would say get it if you like them at all. Klaus Meine still sounds good, but the kids choir sing along on a few songs really did not add anything. Anyway you still will get some enjoyment from this dvd just don't expect it to be the hardcore rock that is really the SCORPS !"
4,"Gr8 Capability, Needs a Treble Control","To begin with, if u want to use these speakers with a computer, consider the rating to be 5 star. I use them with a DVD Player. I sorely missed the presence of treble enhancement. These speakers do have a bass enhancement control (subwoofer vol) but the absence of a treble control cuts out the crisp highs that the speakers are capable of delivering. Computer users wont feel the pinch because they can enhance the treble through windows or their sound playback software. For me, I had to connect standalone graphic equalizers to enhance the highs. After this of course, the results were mind blowing.Everybody is cribbing about the absence of a remote, but that is just an inconvenience. The absence of a treble control seriously hampers the speakers' high pitch output, which hurts especially because the speakers CAN deliver crisp highs if connected thru a graphic eq."
5,Great Book,My boyfriend has an SCI at the C2 level and I bought the book to help me know more about what it is like for him. He read the book also and learned things he did not know about himself even after he has been disabled for 17 years so I guess there is always something new you can learn and I learned a lot from this book myself.
3,Re-branding,"Just a warning for those who've been following/ collecting Kay Hooper since the early days. This book appears to be a re-publication of Loveswept #348, so check your collection before you purchase!"
3,Intriguing Idea,"A modern romance spun around a fairy tale sounds intriguing, but it didn't come off as good as it promised. The hero is incredibly sexy, without any real depth. And the heroine was hard to care a great deal about. I think the worst part was the epilogue, which introduced a rather sinister character without any kind of explanatin, leaving the reader hanging in an uncomfortable position. Would only recommend to someone extremely bored."
1,It doesn't work!,"What a great idea, if only it worked. I bought this as a gift for an avid golfer. The main feature that attracted me was the swing analysis function, but the watch doesn't register half of the swings. We spent more time trying to get the watch to read his swing than we actually spent practicing. What a waste. I am definitely returning it."
1,This CD is so overpriced,"I think that that type of music, trance, is getting old. This CD is overpriced and it has nothing that will catch your attention. Much better to get James Le Velle (i think this is how his name spelled) Romanian CD only!! Second CD in romaia series is the best i ever heard. I also recommend DJ Roog, music of love and dedication vol 2. - second CD only!!!!You'll be extremely pleased with it.This Vincent's Moor CD is not good, don't buy it!!!"
2,"A disappointment. I expected more beef, less filler.","Granted, this is the score to a movie (one that I have never screened...or heard of) but this is atmosphere. The music is subtext, a background for poetry from some very likely sources (Shakespeare), not to belittle William, of course. I simply never expected a band as innovative as Coil to be prone to such coffee house sensibilities. Loss of Fear=Loss of Instinct? Perhaps they were feeling too comfortable."
3,"Decent CD, but live...","I had heard good things about Black Mountain and found the record to be pretty decent. Reminds me of some of that 70's bluesy rock, and I like the girl voice in the mix. I was curious to see them live and then happened to see them open for Coldplay. YIKES! They were absolutely atrocious--like, painfully hard to listen to. The crowd seemed to be blown away by how bad they were. I will never know how they got that gig-- opening for one of the biggest bands in the world..."
5,black mountain,"this is the best record i have heard in years. black mountain is as groundbreaking as music from big pink, raw power or white light white heat.i keep hearing people talk about the record being sabbath influenced. really, i don't see it at all unless occasional guitar distortion equates sabbath. this band reminds me much more of neil young (after the goldrush), velvet underground, later period blue cheer (i'm the light) and country joe and the fish (electric music for mind and body).every song on the record is excellent. my two year old daughter also likes it and is learning to count by listening to modern music.hopefully black mountain will come to northern new england soon."
2,Pull them in with riffs and then some.,"Collective soul's guitar playing is still amazing. But it sounds like with this album somebody told them how big a hit their previous song Heavy from Dosage was and maybe their producer decided to mold some of their songs after it. It sounds like while they were playing around and creating new songs, they found a few riffs and decided to base their entire song all around a riff with uninspired sound in between the catchy riffs. I don't sense as much of an urgency in any of the songs as previously. Maybe it was too early for a new album, they could have taken some more time on their new songs. Their experimentation with new sounds comes out fine, but thats about it. Still, a piece of music is meant to communicate something, and with the right mood and the right track at the same time, each of these songs can be great."
4,Another great Collective soul CD,"Collective Soul has added another excellent CD to it's library with Blender. The thing about Collective Soul is you always know what to expect. This CD sounds like Collective Soul, and that's the best way to explain it. They don't try and constantly change their sound or image with every new release, but continue to stick with the sound that made them popular to begin with. The guitar parts fit perfectly with the drum parts, which fit perfectly with the vocals, which fit perfectly with......anyways you get the point. I own every Collective Soul CD, and can listen to all of them the whole way through without having to skip around to find songs I like. You can't say that about many other bands nowadays. Check it out, you won't be dissapointed."
1,Lack of Diversity,"From the pouting boy-band photos on the cover to the amazingly insignificant content, Collective Soul's Blender is truely disposable.This group seemed to have a lot of potential but is now content to stick with formulaic, repetitive songs that all sound like some other song. The one word titles are evident again. Skin, Vent, Happiness, Bleed, Blame, Heavy... Who can tell them apart?Buy something else.[DW]"
5,Collective Soul CD'S Blender,"I own 10 CD's by Collective Soul, and plan on adding all the rest to my collection. I also have one by Ed-E Roland (signed). Each and every one of the CD's are superb. I have favorite songs on each one. Love Ed Roland's great voice.I would not trade these CD's for anything. This is the most Amazing group since Queen came on the scene back in the 70's. Ed Roland is such a phenomenal writer and frontman. If I say anymore I will only be repeating myself. I simplylove these guys. Was priviledged to see them in concert this year. They are greater than you expect. They give it their all. Blender is so Collective Soul...need I say more."
2,Not as advertised,"This item was passable, but not nearly as advertised. It was heavily worn and looked as if someone spilled a drink on the back side. To claim that it is in good condition is laughable. I will keep it because it is still readable, but don't appreciate deception."
4,Neil Gaiman's latest book is one of his best.,"Although the book reprints several stories from ""Angels and Visitations"" the new material is spectacular. Particularly the story about silent film stars. It would be very hard for anyone not to enjoy this book."
4,A retread of things I've enjoyed before,"Ordinarily, almost everything of Neil's gets 5 stars. I love the stories in this book. I love ""Troll Bridge"" and ""Chivalry"" and ""Looking For The Girl."" The thing is, I read Angels And Visitations ages ago, and before that I read a Datlow/Windling anthology or five, so I've read ""Troll Bridge"" half a dozen times. And ""Babycakes."" And ""Virus."" And even though this collection has more stuff in it, and more comments, and I liked ""When We Went To See The End Of The World by Dawnie Morningside, age 11 1/4"" very much, it doesn't make up for it. I want to see the new stuff."
4,just read it,"This is the first book that I have read from this author and I am highly impressed. Finally, a book where you can get a glimpse of how an author comes up with his stories and what they may mean. The best story has to be the ""Murder Mysteries."" You will want to read it more than once to locate the clues hidden in the story. I am looking forward to reading more of his works."
2,a bit shallow,"Compared with the real stuff, performed by Phil Collins, it misses the sparkle and life that Collin's music is famous for.It is orchestral music, with a nice beat, modern but not exciting. Nice background music."
4,Just buy anything digweed you can't go wrong,"Pretty good, but if you don't have northern exposure expeditions i reccommend picking that up first if you can't do both"
5,A classic,I bought this album along with Transitions Vol. 3 just because I was curious. I'm glad I did because this album is a classic! Both disks are exceptional and this whole album is indeed a great value.
2,Not good at all,"As for this cd, i had really high expectations for it. I have to admit though, it is extremely boring, even for trance music. Trance music naturally is repetitive, but digweed has been able to find a whole new meaning for repetitiveness. He doesn't build you up into a peak at all. even the song selections were poor. when my friends heard it, they also did not like it. in buying a cd i think one can do better with any other cd out there other than this one. i don't recommend this cd to anybody."
4,"Great movie, but poor transfer",This is my favorite version of the book. The romance between Jane Seymour's Ethne and Beau Bridge's Harry is the key to the story here which is the way it should be. The story (of course) is also solid. However - this is DVD sports an iffy transfer that seems to have been taken from some shoddy elements. The sound also is iffy in parts. I love this movie though so I had no hesitation in picking up this DVD.
2,"Skip this one, get the original!","Over half of this movie consists of scenes taken from the original 1939 classic film directed by Zoltan Korda. Even those scenes can't disguise the remake's network TV-movie quality. Beau Bridges is generally a good actor, but he is terribly miscast on this film. Go rent both versions of The Four Feathers and see it for yourself!"
5,A Great history read,"Capt. Bonneville tried and tried but was not able to get his notes together into a comprehensive manuscript. Enter Washington Irving who bought his notes and assembled them into this well written book. It is a narrative of their adventures and a great window into a the mountain man/trapper life. I have recommended this to many of my friends and if you enjoy history, the west, or both; you are sure to enjoy this great book. You will learn from the read and it is also entertaining."
3,Didn't Speak To Me,"So I thought it was time I finally checked out some Borges, I mean, he's supposed to be the man, right? Thus, dipped into this book, reading about 15 or so of the stories before packing it in. They kind of drifted over me leaving no great impression. They all felt very similar in style and tone, and I couldn't see reading another 50 of the same kind of stories. The only two I recall are ""The Lottery in Babylon"" and ""The Zahir."" Obviously Borges can write and tell a story, just not in a way that appeals to me."
1,Tragedy,"An abortion. Read other 1-star reviews for more depth, but please, please do not read anything translated by Andrew Hurley. It's sad that people don't realize there are other options out there probably because this complete fictions pop-up first on Amazon. Start with Labyrinths. Do not read anything translated by Andrew Hurley, read Di Giovanni, Yeats..."
1,Skip this,"I was surprised. ""A little secret"" was not found by the author. He just quoted Henry Longhurst's comment on BBC. The secret is similar to Harvey Penick's. And no other secrets in this book at all.2/3 of this book is filled with golf's popular explanations of fundamentals. I can write them. So can you. Why do you need this book?"
3,"Inexpensive, decent quality.","Got these for the parking duties at Church. The safety cone slips onto the flashlight, and has no retention device. I have seen other people use tape as the cone begins to lose retention. Other than that it is OK for the money."
5,Zoo Keeper,The puzzle designs are very simple and easy to understand but will have you searching all over the board for a matching animal. A low timer will have you searching frantically for a match only to have you scream in agony when the game shows you the obvious match right in front of you after time runs out. Zoo Keeper makes you want to keep playing over and over again.Zo o Keeper is one of those games that you buy to keep you entertained.
4,"Simple and fun, but...","Okay...most may see this a stupid nitpick, but the obnoxious 'comments' from the zoo keeper/director/whatever are REALLY annoying to me, and unnecessary. Also, why do the animals have to look so mean and scowly all the time? That makes the game a bit less fun, IMHO. Should be more like the cell phone game ""ZooZoo Club"", where the animals at least look friendly. Aside from all that, the gameplay is fine for what it is."
5,Helpful and Inspiring,"I bought this book mainly because it's about ballet, but after I started reading I discovered the book was more than that. The diet plan works so well and the pictures and interviews with other dancers are inspiring. I actually lost weight with this book, and always keep it on hand to refer to. Its definitly a must have."
5,Awesome,"Man, this game is the bomb. I loved command and conquer Red Alert that i played at my cousins house and thought id buy it. then i saw all of it (red alert, expansons, c&c, and its expansions) all in one box. and it was only a little bit more $$ so i thought why not. i love them both and the expansions rule. they are the coolest games i have for the computer and i cant wait to get Tiberian Sun."
1,Buyer Beware,"EA has really done it this time. BEWARE!! If you have an Intel processor for graphics this game will not work. I have XP with the latest graphics updates, Xtreme graphics, and drivers and the system keeps shutting the game down as a threat to computer. I also have well above the specs necessary that are stated. System says a line in the program is creating the problem, EA says the program will only run with certain graphics programs. Bottom line read the small print and check your computer specs. The ad for the product does not tell you all, check EA to find out which graphic programs will run the game properly. Even a vista program with a intel graphics program will not work properly. I tried. Kids extremely disappointed. We have all the other games and had no problem,however with this one I guess you need to buy a certain kind of computer to play it."
1,So unbelievably bad,"I had high hopes for this game because of the first three. I thought it would be mostly the same except hopefully better graphics. I was horrified. It is extremely difficult to walk or move in any direction. I found the wand almost impossible. I couldnt direct it, let alone cast a spell. It was not engaging despite the high quality graphics. I am sticking to the first three. They had horrible graphics, but the game sucked you in and it was fun to play. Do not buy this its a waste of money!"
1,Digital upgrade from Vista Basic to Premium,"Do not waste your money.Buy from another site as I purchased this from Amazon and then needed to buy a Anytime disk, and that did not help either, was not able to download key, and neither Amazon or Microsoft could resolve my problem, so money was wasted as Amazon does not stand behind what they sell."
4,Works,I bought this product because I have sun spots on the upper parts of my cheekbones and forehead. I had heard that this product's ingredients are not as harsh as a lot of the skin lightening products on the market. I've been using this product for about a month (2 times a day when I remember) and it has helped lighten the sun damage considerably. I don't know if the sun spots will ever be completely gone. But I've started using dermablend foundation which has worked out well to help cover what still remains. I have very pale porcelean like skin and with the help of this and the dermablend my skin looks almost perfect.
1,careful when buying for F150,"Compatibility check very mis-leading - it said it was compatible with my F150 in big letters but it was not - make sure your VIN 11th letter is a ""C"". otherwise you may need 45D2314"
4,the overseer,CLEVER-VERY CLEVER AND WELL WRITTEN.NOT AS FAR FETCHED AS SOME ARE SAYING.I AM ALWAYS IMPRESSED WITH A WRITER THAT KNOWS HIS HISTORY AND CAN WEAVE A CLEVER MYSTERY AROUND THIS KNOWLEDGE....ENJOY IT. RICHARD S. DAVIS-COLLINGDALE PA.
1,Boring to the point of despair !!!,I purchased this book based on the comments by the other readers and never have I been most disappointed.How can 16 readers be right and me wrong.I just don't know.The author although an expert in history and philosophy lacks to create a plausible plot.A slow read it took me ages to complete.Hope to be more lucky next time.
2,Should have showed more of the Eisenriech teaching..,"this book started out good, but there were too many characters to keep track of, and not enough scenes in which the actual terror of Eisenriech training was described. Only the viewing of the videotaped classroom sessions were of great detail. Overall, readable, but I would say a must-read. i could have done without it."
4,Nevil Shute,Nevil Shute (Norway)'s Round the bend recently purchased is an early classic from this engineer & writer. It is written in a gentle reflective manner promoting basic values and asking questions of the reader. Recommended
2,Not a real trooper...,"This movie is Ok, with some fresh humor, but most of it is just plain old ""shock humor"". The plot and storyline is poor, and the actors are average at best. But, it's still is better than ""Serendipity""!!"
2,NOT SO HOT,"This movie is about nothing. Two groups of cops hate each other, the locals and the Highway Patrol. Along the way they run around in thier underware, run around naked and try to trick motorists as they pull em over. They happen across a murder and a drug deal and then the wild highjinks begin. Yawn... then there is more underware and jokes about passing gas and peoples rear ends and stuff...Yawn.. so as the end approaches you....Zzzzzzzzzzzz"
3,super troopers dvd,"the dvd had sticky residue on the cover, and the cover itself was a little beat up, but other than that, everything was fine."
4,I've rewatched this movie probably 20 times,"Broken Lizard is the bomb. Each guy has their own style, and you see it in each film. Although I don't want to say that this is one of my favorite films, I don't think there are many other films that I watch over and over again like this one. There are too many classic scenes in this movie...quotes galore. If you have an open mind and love humor, you will find this film to be entertaining. I can see why it's a cult classic...hell, I didn't see this until it was on DVD. Yes, I own it. :)"
2,Perfect for pubescent males,"This was made for teenage boys, I guess, and feels like it was made by a few of them as well. Barely as good as Reno 9/11, actually, and that's not saying too much.I was told by a number of folks that this is a unique and intelligent comedy. It is neither of those things. Super Poopers is no more than a bad slapstick comedy with amazingly immature and unfunny sight gags and endless sophomoric jokes.Passola."
3,Pretty Funny,"When I first head the name Super Troopers, I thought about a bunch of soldiers with rocket packs, all shooting aliens on Mars. Well, I was obviously mistaken, because Super Troopers is about a bunch of cops who have too much fun. They love pulling pranks on civilians, as well as on members of rival police forces. The bear and the bulletproof cup were really funny, and there were other laughs here and there. There is a plot, kind of, but the real treat of Super Troopers lies in its characters and their meddling jokes. This movie is great to watch with friends."
5,Troopers Rocks,"Farrelly bros. meet the Highway Patrol?Did the Farrelly's make this one? Excellent frat and gross out humour flick rank right up there with Animal House, Caddyshack, Stripes, Dumb and Dumber, and Van Wilder. My side is still splitting with pain from all the laughter. MEOW!"
5,"Up There With Airplane & Police Academy. Yes, its that good","This is one of those cult movies that you simply must own. If you liked Police Academy, Airplane, and Naked Gun type humor than you will absolutely love this movie.Great writing, great ensemble cast, every scene is dripping in humor...It is simply a must see"
5,Completely surprised,My boyfriend picked out this rental. I was totally against it thinking it was going to be a stupid brainless no laugh attempt at comedy. This movie was the total opposite. It is filled with quick wit and I laughed the entire way through. The script is so clever and actually not predictable. Can't wait to see these guys do something else.
4,one of the funniest movies in the world,"I give this movie 5 stars for comedy, but the movie does not have a good plot. So, instead of giving this movie a perfect 5-out-of-5 rating, i chose to give Super Troopers a **** (4-star) rating.The movie focuses upon wacky vermont state highway troopers who are nearing being shut down. To save their station they battle with the local spurbury police for a drug bust, murder investigation, and much more.I highly recommend watching this movie although it compromises a good plot for a few good laughes."
1,jokes were old and stale,"every joke in this film was recycled. i thought the movie had no plot and i fell asleep watching it.do not buy this movie. it is a waste of money. this movie is very boring. the acting stinks and the plot is razor thin. this movie is not even worth a rental. sorry, to the people, in the movie but it is a real piece of junk. this movie is actually one of the worst ""comedy"" movies i have ever seen. almost as bad as NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ""GOLDDIGGERS""."
2,underchilled and underwhelmed,"I debated long and hard over buying this cooler for an upcoming annual trip, where we share a house at the beach with friends, and always run out of fridge and freezer space. Most of the reviews I read were decent, so I took a chance. We started off with it packed with a combination of ice, frozen foods, and previously chilled foods and beverages. By the time we reached out destination (an 8 hour drive), we had mostly water and partially thawed foods. It was a warm day, but it was in an air conditioned car with the exception of a short ferry ride. At our vacation place, we used it as a second fridge, with similar results. How anyone gets more than a day or so out of it is beyond me...and it certainly didn't perform as advertised! The trade of in cooler space for additional ""Xtreme"" insulation is a bad deal, in our book. Given the givens, we'd have just used our old cooler and added a few groceries!"
2,Extreme? No.,"I bought this cooler. The claim is up to five days. However, no minimum is given, so the claim means nothing. It has more insulation than a regular cooler; however, the drain area in the bottom has less insulation, and the four cupholders, with no insulation, are a weakness. With ice in the cooler, they are cold to the touch, a definite engineering error. As another reviewer said, it will keep ice for five days, but only if you keep it full, and in my opinion, do not open the cooler. The reality is that it is good for two to three days, but even less if you start with non-cooled sodas or other items or it is opened often, such as at a picnic or at the beach. It is better than a regular cooler, which in my opinion are just containers. You best bet is to put more money into more ice. Nowadays, marketing people call their entry-level products new and improved, kingsize, or supreme as a rule. This is an example of that type of marketing."
4,This cooler does the job,"I've used this cooler on a 7-day sailing kayak-camping trip along coastal everglades here in S Florida. I'm always careful to keep any cooler in the shade as much as possible, and I open it as little as possible. The cooler still had ice (in 2-l bottles) remaining at the end of the trip. It was never 90 deg, but I was satisfied with the cooler. I gave it 4-stars because you could always ask for more.The person who complained about the drink holders being cold ought to stick foam in those openings if they are not going to use them. Others might love a cooled drink holder for a coke at 90 deg."
4,colorful but less substance that rest of boynton series,this one is super cute if you're really into hippos...not my son's favorite Boynton book - but they can't all be!
5,ALWAYS FUN SANDRA BOYNTON,"At 2 1/2 my son is really starting to outgrow the typical toddler books but Boynton's books, because of the lyrical rhymes and hilarious and charming illustrations remain favorites to read all the time. As you might guess, this book is a counting book as various animal groups engage in activities with increasing numbers on each page, all the way up to ten. The books are as fun to read for a parent as they are for a child to listen to and when you add in that they are also learning their numbers AND their animals, you really can't go wrong. This one is another winner from Sandra!"
4,"A Very Good, Concise History of a Broad Subject","This book provides a really good overview of the resistance efforts opposing the Nazis in Europe, with one large omission -- the Soviet partisans are largely ignored. I would imagine this is because their actions would completely fill the book. Several well known actions are highlighted and obscure efforts are also explained and put into perspective. The sections on France and Norway are particularly strong. Overall this book is a good introduction and basic history of the WW2 resistance movements. I enjoyed it."
3,"""No f**king on grass.""""","Maybe I'm a grumpy goose or something but I didn't find this book to be all that funny. If I'd first seen it in a store I would have looked at it and chuckled for a minute or two then put it back on the shelf. Instead since I couldn't find it in the store I bought it online, chuckled for a minute or two standing in my living room, put it on the shelf and haven't looked at it since.The idea of replacing words in signs with the f-word is pretty funny, but a lot of the stuff in here is just flat. Worth flipping through once (maybe twice) but that's it."
2,Not as funny as I thought it would be,"Don't get me wrong, this book is funny- but not laugh out loud funny. I was excited to get this book as the previous reviews really talked it up. Unfortunately, I wish I would have saved my money. Now my mom or someone that doesn't use the 'f' word like it's their job, might think differently."
5,Grandson Fascinated By Escalators,"I have a Grandson who is extremely fascinated by Escalators. I had even gone to the point of capturing pictures off the Internet and creating him a book. This book is now one of his favorite books. If your son or grandson has this fascination, I highly recommend it."
2,Rejected for a good reason,"I can't get my head around the positive reviews for this score. The rightfully rejected score to Timeline is Goldsmith at his most generic. He simply got this score completely wrong, and his sounds just never come across as natural or indigenous to the story. There is one bright spot, track 2 'Cornflakes' is a wonderfully bittersweet tangent, and it's almost worth buying the CD for, but the rest is pure drudgery. It was Goldsmith's second last scoring assignment, and his last for his old friend Richard Donner, but for a better epitaph for a great composer check-outLooney Tunes: Back In Action."
4,Very Informative/Useful Information,"I think that this book is a must for anyone writing a paper on Homosexuality, Homophobia, or Gay Rights. The authors do an excellent job at debuking many stereotypes found it America. They are obviously extremely emotionally involved in the struggle for gay rights and they display their emotion excessively in this book. Maybe even to a point of indulgence, but it still is greatly helpful, so 4 Stars."
1,Got Riped off,"I just paid $14.99 to purchase an entire CD vol 1 & 2 because I could not purchase the single of Santa Baby by the Pussycat Dolls, than come to find after I paid this amount this 1 song I wanted did not down load. In addition to this there were 36 songs total showing as part of this price however when I did the down load I only got 7 songs out of the 36. Do not purchase this on here just go to the store and purchase it to save headaches, wasted time, and wasted money."
4,Sweet 16 and Licensed to Drive,"Buckle up for the ultimate getaway with Mary-Kate and Ashley!Taylor and Kylie Hunter are sweet sixteen and licensed to drive. Grab a seat in their classic Mustang convertible as they set out on their very first road trip, to the Winter Games in Utah. Cute outfits, even cuter guys. And all kinds of friends along the way. But watch out for Olympic-size detours.This movie is really cute and gives us a glimpse into what Mary-Kate and Ashley can really do! I think this is one of their best movies yet!***Check it out!!***"
1,BADDDDD!,"horrible, bad! just like ne other mary kate and ashley movie....guys and fashion. and half the time the get thur and something happens. it's not that great and i don't recommond it! maybe if the twins would spilt up for once in would better. it would let us see what they are like without the other!"

1,come on !!!!!,how many times can they mess up ????its sutch a slow moviei just wanted to see it beacuse mary kate and ashely were in it but i reagret itDO NOT BUY IT ITS STUPID !!!!!
5,Hitchcock's best,"From the dizzying opening sequence to the terrifying climax, this truly is a masterpiece. It is Hitchcock at his best. The performance by James Stewart and the beautiful San Francisco scenery is perfectly captured by the cinematography. It is one of the greatest films of all time."
4,Really good,"but a little melodramatic at times. It was a little different from the Master's style, but It was still excellent and directors should change their style every now and then. The story is one-of-a-kind."
4,Movie Craftsmanship at its best,"James Stewart can do no wrong in my eyes, and probably in the eyes of the vast majority of the movie-going public. It is obvious why he was a favourite of Alfred Hitchcock's. Here he shows not only his usual charm, but also a slightly sinister side, evidence of his great talents as an actor and not just a star. The plot is interesting, and best enjoyed if you don't try to guess ahead. The restored version shows the beautiful colour of the original and particularly the fine costume design. The sound restoration is also worthy of mention. It is handled sensitively by re-creating the sound effects in stereo and adding a clean copy of the Bernard Hermann score to the best versions of the dialogue the restorers could find. It might lack authenticity but it does make the film more enjoyable than some of the worn-out prints we had been used to, which really did not do the film justice."
3,Classic Hitchcock...,"Yes, that's right I just saw the acclaimed Hitchcock classic, in it's entirety for the first time. Kim Novak, what a Hottie, but that's besides the point.....James Stewart, always a great actor seemed a little to...how do I say it? Overacting. Yes it's the style of the day, but in this film there were too many times where I just said ""jeez, give me a break"". Okay, okay, calm down classic movie buffs....it's just my opinion. Great story and wonderfully composed shots, but I thought the lighting was very uneven and of course, for the style of the day....Brian De Palma's ""Body Double"" ripped the hell off of this movie. The double female impersonators, setting up a ' witness' for the muder of someone's wife and even down to the kissing scen between Stewart and Novak at the old mission was so close, wow......nice to see De Palma paid attention, worked well in Body Double, even though now it seems pretty damn purposeful."
5,One of Hitchcock's greatest achievements,I thought that Vertigo ranks number one on my Alfred Hitchcock list. I thought that the begining was the best part where James Stewart was about to fall off the roof of the building. The part where James Stewart sees Kim Novak jump off the tower was the part where I thought that he was going to kill himself also. I think that everyone should see this movie just once.
4,**THIS REVIEW IS ONLY FOR THE DVD**,"Good extras, but should have been more. BOTH versions of this DVD are the same, just with a different cover. The extras include ALL:*""Obsessed with Vertigo"" Featurette*Commentary by: Herbert Coleman, Robert A. Harris, and James C. Katz*Production Notes*Talent Bios*Film Highlights*Theatrical TrailerThere SHOULD have been more features, considering this is considered Hitchcock's best film."
2,Just an old movie,This is just an old movie that has been remade in different ways over and over and over and over again.
5,One of the best,"One of Hitchcock's best movies. A very good story and plot, with a good amount of entertaining suspence. I can watch it over and over without getting bored. Strongly recommended."
1,Too old to be relevant -- a 1992 book with a new title,"I was a great fan of this author's 1992 book titled 'All Right,OK, You Win,' which was an insightful and well-written overview of theStrip. When I saw this book, 'Welcome to the Pleasuredome,' I hoped for an update of all that has happened on the Strip since 1992. Imagine my dismay when I discovered it's the exact same book as 'All Right, OK, You Win,' with a different cover and a different title. END"
3,sonic mega collection,"I used to like sonic, but now I like 3D games better, and this title is a bit too repetitive. 2D is not the same as well I guess. It is a classic though, but not the best game."
3,Sonic is as good as ever...,"This is great for ""old school"" gamers who might have grown up in the 90's when gameplay was much less sophisticated. If you liked the original Sonic games back in the day, then you'll love having all of them packaged on one disc for hours of enjoyment."
1,Cheap,"Don't waste your time they are so cheap and barely work. As a former raver, I thought my kid would think they were super cool,, Wrong!"
1,utterly dissapointing,"The new Straylight Run Cd is a far cry from the great first effort.I was expecting real good things out of the album, and with the excpetion of one song i can honestly say this album is garbage. ""Who will save us now"" I must say is a track that everyone needs to listen to regardless of musical taste, other than that not much really works, if you are epecting music that rivals that of Straylight Run's first Cd, then honestly this cd is a waste of money, but to each his own"
4,"Funky, but it works","Less consistency than I was expecting, but still a good album from start to finish. Includes a couple of melodies you won't be able to get out of your head and poetic lyricism."
3,Good sci-fi elements...,"This exciting, but ultimitely forgettable flick takes ""The Fugitive"" with ""Blade Runner"" and gives us a pretty neat chase film that doesn't make too much of a lasting impression. Gary Sinise is a weapons designer who is accused of being an alien spy with a bomb implanted in him that will go off when he encounters the president. He races to prove his innocence. Not too long, running just over an hour and a half, this film makes for some good sci-fi fun while not really doing anything new. It's got some good special effects, but when the credits roll, the viewer is left with little more than when they started."
3,"Has some interesting twists, but well, whatever...","Perhaps I am getting jaded, but I rarely find sci-fi films that I like much. There is nothing wrong or ridiculous about this film: it is an identity question, where Sinise is apparently mistaken for a robotic baddie sent from mysterious aliens at war with Earth. He gets into quite an adventure, running around to exonerate himself and in the process revealing a pretty complex (and unfortunate) society. As is typical with PKD, you are not sure who the good and bad guys are, so the viewer is kept guessing. Alas, when I got to the end, I wasn't that surprised, indeed I kind of wanted it to end because I didn't feel I had entered this particular future with much enthusiasm. It is a pretty run of the mill suspense/thriller hard sci fi."
3,Average Rendition of PK Dick,"Certainly not as good as Total Recall, and of course, the classic, Blade Runner, but still an admirable and entertaining effort with many of your stock sci fi adventure characters. Well, it wasn't Phil Dick's best story either."
2,seriously disappointed,"This book lacks focus -- excuse the pun. There is commentary regarding 35mm, medium format and large format cameras, as well as digital. Yet, I believe, the major audience probably does not use all three. It would be more useful to concentrate on one format, perhaps the most popular.There is no correlation between the text and the images. The images are awful when it comes to truly supporting the concepts that are in the text. The text is equally poorly written.Don't get me wrong, there is some valuable information in this book, but it's hard to find and it's not easily extracted."
2,not as cute as pictured,"I thought this was the cutest bassinet ever, but I read the bad reviews & decided I must see one in person before I buy it. I have to say I am not buying it. It just is not real sturdy and the matress is the really cheap one that comes with your changing table but no one uses. My husband said he could fix all of the problems but for this amount of money I think it should come ready to use. The screw holes are a major eyesore and the wood is flimsy."
5,The Best Christmas record in Christian music,"Christmas Offerings is absolutely an amazing and personal Christmas journey with Third Day. It respresents all that is and all that is hoped for, it is definitely one of the best! Third Day is truly one of the greatest artist in music!!"
4,"Good southern rock, good songs.","It's difficult to to do a rock album of Holiday songs. It's even harder to do one of traditional Christmas Carols-but here you have it. 'O Holy Night' is rarely done with more passion, and 'Joy to the World' is almost as moving. Lead singer Mac Powell reminds me of BS&T's David Clayton-Thomas, and shows some writing talent on 'Born in Bethlehem'. Some of the tracks are live-- which I don't personally care for-- but otherwise this is an excellent production of good southern Rock-N-Roll with a joyous message."
5,I sing of Chicago glad and big The people 'Yes',"Sandburg is direct and strong and clear. This collection of poems first published in 1916 has as its signature poem ""Chicago''. Chicago, the toolmaker, meat butcher, stacker of wheat the great brawler of the cities is at once Sandburg's home and posture to the world. Sandburg can also write tenderly as of the famous ""Fog"" that comes in on 'little cats feet' and with moving power of love ( Tell me in the grave, if the lovers are the losers) and war( Shovel them high at Ypres... I am the dust I cover them all) .He is a poet of the American experience, the American street and its people . And he is like the beloved Lincoln he would write a long biography of, a man of the people whose poetry is truly for the people.The People Yes."
3,Not all that,"I love Boris Karloff, the voice is delicious, but his reading is rather uninspired, unimaginative and cautious-sounding, but not nearly so pedestrian as the conducting of Mario Rossi, who has at his disposal the highly capable Vienna State Opera orchestra (read, Vienna Philharmonic) who could play the pants off this piece even if left to their own devices, and not held back by the willful torpor of their baton-waiver. But alas, the performance simply drags along tediously, if such a thing is possible with this most delightful of musical stories. The Kije is merely a serviceable performance, too, of something that should effervesce. I regret not being more positive; the voice of Karloff should have been coupled with a more vital conductor. The recorded sound (from 1957) as typical of Seymour Solomon's audiophile work for Vanguard and other labels is superlative analog."
5,Classic Kid Music,"I bought this because I wanted it for my pre-school class. I remembered how much I enjoyed the Disney version as a kids and I am a fan of Boris Karloff""s narration skills. (IE. The Grinch that Stole Christmas) This is a great alternative to the (apparently unavailable) Disney version. However there is one minor difference ***SPOILER ALERT*** in this version the duck actually does get eaten by the wolf. This may not be the best choice for overly sensitive children. My kid and my class love it!"
3,Was OK for a while,"When I upgraded my computer to Vista, this printer no longer worked properly. I researched and downloaded a current driver, at least 7 times, and it still does not work properly. Printed colors are totally unacceptable. I have switched to black ink in all the slots and use it for junk printing. UPDATE - the printer has suddenly failed to turn on, as if there was no power."
4,"Fast Printing, Vivid Colors!","Whisper-quiet and fast, this is an amazing printer. The colors are vivid and you don't need the manual to configure the custom print quality settings. There is a caddy for holding 4x6 photo paper that you can select with the quick twist of a knob.The only problem I had with this printer is one of the USB ports stopped working, and I was unable to get my computer to recognize the printer. Luckily, this printer has a second USB port and when I connected using that port my computer quickly recognized the printer.This is a sturdy printer that seems to never run out of ink. Oddly enough, Canon discontinued this printer after less than a year, maybe because it uses ink so slowly.Give it a try - highly recommended!"
5,Excellent Choice,I chose a cannon printer because I was replacing a vintage b&w canon that was still working great. Right out of the box it produced photo lab quality 4x6 on canon pro paper. With all of the different printers out there I was nervous about my decision while awaiting shipment. No worries now.
4,"Dear Mr. ""U R All Troglodytes""","This isn't a real review, but rather tips for the reviewer mentioned above. I, too, had the same trouble. Even sent the thing in for service, etc. Still, lines! ARGH! Then, one day I took a stab, since I had photo paper to waste, considering it wasn't WORKING, and I tried printing out of a different software program. VOILA! No lines! The pix were beautiful! Something was going haywire with the printer and the Kodak software I was using -- not that the Canon tech people have any idea about that, after having spent hours on the phone with 'em. Now I just use Microsoft Picture It to print from, and it works swell. Try that. U might be surprised."
2,THE COLOR REPRODUCTION IS JUST TERRIBLE,"HI, -- I GAVE THIS PHOTO PRINTER 2 STARS , RATHER THAN 1 STAR, BECAUSE, IT IS FAST, HOWEVER, IT IS USELESS TO ME, RIGHT NOW, -- I OWN A $900.00 CANON DIGITAL SLR CAMERA ( WHICH IS GREAT ) - BUT, I AM SO DISSAPOINTED IN THIS PRINTER, -- IT IS PRINTING PHOTOS THAT ARE WAY TO BRIGHT, AND THE HUE IS TO YELLOWISH GREEN, VERY NOTICEABLE WITH PHOTOS OF PEOPLE, -- WHAT REALLY BOTHERS ME IS THAT, I CAN PRINT THE EXACT SAME PHOTO, UNEDITED, WITH MY HEWLETT PACKARD 4 IN 1 5510 OFFICEJET, AND THE COLOR COMES OUT GREAT, JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL PHOTO -- I DID READ VERY GOOD REVIEWS ON THIS PRINTER, -- AND I AM SENDING SOME PHOTOS IN TO THE CANON COMPANY, FOR THE ENGINEERS TO REVIEW -( HAS ANYONE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM ? ) - WILLIS KUHNS"
5,excellent printer,I have always used Canon printers because of their multiple ink tank design. I use generic ink in refillable cartridges to maximize cost effectiveness. This printer does an excellent job.
4,Good one!,"I bought this Cd and I thought it was pretty good. I love the song Interstellar Overdrive it's just mind twisting. The song ""Bike"" is childish and laughably stupid though. Other than that it is amazing work of that time."
3,Collection of Early Floyd Singles,"Released in 1971, Relics is a compilation of early Pink Floyd singles. My favorites here are ""Arnold Layne"", ""See Emily Play"", ""Paintbox"", and ""Julia Dream"". ""Interstellar Overdrive"" is out-of-place on a singles album, and ""Cirrus Minor""/""The Nile Song"", a couple of Roger Waters songs from the post-Barrett More album, don't really belong here either. Relics is nice to have for the rarities though."
3,"Great Story, Terrible Ending","This book is great until you get to the neatly packaged, quickly thrown together ending. Cat is a fabulous character whom anyone who has every had a psychotic episode over the wrong man can totally relate to. I found myself laughing out loud several times during this easy read. But the ending is too neat, too obvious and too much of a let down after such a fun read.As a frame of reference, chick lit I love: Bridget Jones, Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination, Mr. Maybe, Hard,and, of course, the Shopaholic Series."
4,"A fun, different read!","This read is great for anyone who is feeling that life just isn't going her way right now. Cat's antics and efforts to get ""back her men"" are a bit far fetched, but humorous. I thought the ending of the book was not expanded upon enough, and the middle a bit draggy. But, if you have a good sense of humor, and like a character with a bit of an edge, you'll like Cat and ""What Goes Around"". I'd recommend it for a light read on a long weekend."
4,Another Talented Melodic Death Metal Act...,"While not being one of the best Melodic Death Metal Acts, Nightrage has proved themselves to be a force to be reckoned with. The vocals are excellent. The Death Metal growls are done by Tomas Lindberg of the legendary band At the Gates, and the clean vocals are of Peter Englund of the Progressive metal band Evergrey. This is, if you are familiar at all with Swedish metal, a winning combination. Members of Dream Evil and The Haunted are also present, and the ""rage"" of this album comes from its all-star members. Nightrage is a promising Heavy Metal act that should breathe new life into the Gothenburg-inspired Death Metal scene. This band is definitely for fans of At the Gates, Dark Tranquillity, or Arch Enemy. If you like those bands, my instinct tells me you will enjoy this as well."
3,Profondeur d'une voix....,J'ai bien écouter le CD de Marie-Elaine et il est clair que cette dernière a une voix indéniable. Plusieur gens la compare a Edith Piaf pour la profondeur et la maturité de sa voix sans compter son talent indéniable d'interprétation.Je trouve parcontre que les chansons choisis sont tous a caractère slow et manque de rythme. Plusieurs des chansons choisis proviennent de reprises de succès qui pourra satisfaire un auditoire plus agé que jeune.
4,Great Body Hair Trimmer,"This trimmer is probably the best one I have ever used. It trims close to the skin, so be careful around sensitive areas."
4,"Good, but not enough!","this trimmer require a little bit more of blade, in general it's a good products, but a little for work in large areas."
5,Juan Sebastian Con Mariachi,"This CD is one of the most incredibly romantic, passionet and intoxicating CDs that I have ever listened to. The passion that Joan projects in his songs is WOW!"
4,Buy The Soundtrack,"This film is entertaining and harmless; simple feel-good stuff. Its best features are the soundtrack (awesome boogie-woogie piano and big-band clarinet!) and the cameo appearance of B-movie demi-god Bruce Campbell in the movie-within-a-movie role of an ""Intrepid Explorer"". Worth a rental; buy the soundtrack."
2,This movie is sappier than Aunt Jemima syrup,"The worst thing about the Majestic is that it truly brings out the weakness in Martin Landau and Jim Carrey. To see LANDAU in his true and rare form, see this master play Bela Lugosi in Tim Burtons Ed Wood, then watch The Majestic."
3,not nearly as good as it could've been,"...Jim Carrey does a fine job of dramatic acting, the plot is fairly intriguing, there is a cogent anti-McCarthyism subtext, and yet---and yet this film falls short of its potential, mainly during the final 15 minutes or so when it collapses into cornball sentimentalism and preachiness.Looks like a good case of life imitating art: in the beginning of the film, we see Carrey as a Hollywood screenwriter at a meeting with some studio bigwigs with famously horrible schmatzy taste who mangle his written film's ending while trying to please the masses and drive up box office profits. ""The Majestic"" seems to have suffered the exact same fate, though probably at the hands of braindead focus groups as much as cheesy studio bosses.Enjoy the first 3/4 of the film, then fast forward through the last bit."
2,A dud...,"Jim Carrey attempts once again to prove to people he can act after the success of his previous starring role in The Truman Show. The script falls flat as soon as you hear the voice over and makes you go ""Uh oh, a film about films."" It soon reverts to a montage of people telling us why cinema is 'magical' mixed in with a love story and some communist subtexts in there which seem dull and uninteresting and sort of shows the script is desperatly trying to tell a story of some sort of importance while Frank Darabont's films just keeping getting worse and worse. (Can't wait for Farhenheit 451, Frank!) Good preformances from Carrey and Martin Landau but you'd be better off giving this one a miss."
5,Must See!,"This is my favorite Jim Carrey movie, that I have ever seen, and I am a big fan of his comedy work. It is a very serious role for him and amazingly, he's completely believable. The story is that Jim Carrey's character in is a car crash, wakes up with amnesia, gets mistaken for a lost soldier, and starts living the life the soldier would live. That includes helping fix up the abandoned theater in town and generally lighting up the townspeople's lives. It's an excellent movie and it does, in fact need to be 3 hours long. It's absolutely worth your time, whether you're a fan of Jim Carrey or not!"
1,the stepford town.....,"this film, about people who love movies, just may cause you to develop a blind hatred of movies...a genuinely sweet attempt to recapture the Capra-esque spirit is buried somewhere within the glacial expanse of this film, which feels like an all-encompassing bit of fakery...especially in the whole HUAC hearings sub-plot, where the film seems to veer wildly away from realism, toward a desire to tug the audience's heartstrings and reward sentiment......it might not be so creepy if it didn't trivialize the actual McCarthy witchhunts, or if you hadn't seen the truman show. (to those who have, try watching these two movies back to back...there seem to be some eerie parallels..)two bright spots are the Sand Pirates of the Sahara, and Martin Landeau's performance.....his are the only emotions that seem to cut through the stifling atmosphere and ring true-sentimental without being eerily saccarine...."
4,Otherwise a charming film...,"Amnesia and a startling physical resemblance to a local hero (MIA in WWII) give L.A. screenwriter (Jim Carrey) a new life--temporarily. Carrey does a splendid job--no surprise, since comedy requires more skill than ""drama"" to begin with. Good acting all around, and a charming view of post-WWII, small-town life in California. The main problem with this movie is the writer's implication that communism wasn't so bad: The real villain was the U.S. Government. This notion needs correction: Communism is bad. It was outlawed as a party in the U.S. of America because, like today's Al Qaida, it vowed to destroy the United States (and our free, constitutional government)and take over the world. And like Al Quaida, it promises a hoax-utopia in which only tyrants flourish, and dissidents are murdered by the millions. Except for this glaring abuse of history, it's a charming film."
3,What was that all about?!,"Unless you're a collector or a hard-core fan of Jim, why would you buy it?? I'd say wait for it to come on National TV and then watch it and get disappointed anyway."
3,"Fast read, Totally unrealistic","Mr Kelly may have quite a bit of inside knowledge of the SEALs and the Air Commandos, but none of that knowledge is in evidence in this reed thin novel. Most of the people that read this book and think that Mr Kelly knows and displays everything, just show you how little they know about the military in general and how much less they know about special operations in particular.Having said that, it was still an entertaining book. Not high literature, but hey, you can't have everything."
1,Holy Bejesus,"Who is this confused individual from Florida calling this turkey a masterpiece? Maybe the ""director"" lives in Florida? This film is a prime candidate for Mystery Science Theatre. Laughable on all aspects, it can only be called a modern day Ed Wood Film. The music score takes it down even more notches."
2,"effort, but not punch","This writing style is forced and cryptic. While he seems to think he's quite clever at his portrayal of characters, I can't quite fairly comment because I couldn't make it through more than a few pages before growing bored with his characters. Maybe you'll have much better luck than I did. Trying ""building"" your characterization skills more! Better luck next time Greg."
3,I ain't lyin'!,"This CD contains the original rap monologue ""Dolemite"" which has established the career of Rudy Ray Moore, known as the Godfather of Rap and King of Party Records. Mr. Moore glides through such classic raps as the ""Signifying Monkey"" and, the folklore tale ""Petey Wheatstraw"", also featured on this CD is a longtime favorite ""The Great Titanic"".Mr. Moore glides through the rap monologue with perfect timing, which makes him the worlds first comic to take a bold approach in the comedy vein using ghetto expressions in a form of art. Mr. Moore has gained respect from many great rappers and comedians from this CD. Many rappers have sampled and gave lyrical nods to Mr. Moore. Keep on doing your thing. Hail to the king of party records."
3,not great for gelatin preparations.,If you're looking to use your thermo whip for gelatin preparations be aware that it must cool 15 hours in the fridge before it is ready to dispense. Had I known I would have bought the non- thermo version.
1,To avoid,"This is the perfect recipe for turning a fascinating and dramatic piece of History into a Hollywood non sense. The next movie ""Marie-Antoinette"" starring Kirsten Dunst was not better, music was awful, and the lead actress dreadful to watch..."
4,Simon baker shows his promise,"We don't know as much about French History as the other reviewers, but we watched this on TV and thought it was an exciting film. I especially enjoyed the performance of Simon Baker(now THE MENTALIST on TV). This movie had a great cast, and we were kept involved because we didn't know what was going to happen with the French Revolution pending. If you want to know history, read a book. If you want to be entertained, watch this movie."
3,I just can't put my finger on it.,"I bought this movie because the cast was wonderful, from Hillery Swank, Simon Baker to Christopher Walken I figured I couldn't go wrong....The tone of the film is lovely, the sets wonderful, the costumes divine and yet some how this piece just didn't work for me.Okay I expect film makers to rewrite history, so that didn't get to me. The plot seemed interesting enough, but somehow it left me flat.But still a good way to waste a couple of hours, I'm not sure if I will ever watch this film again, but I'm glad I did."
1,Junk,"I recieved the Graco Tango in the Tongo diaper bags that I had registered for as a baby shower gift. It looked good on paper. But on the larger bag the inner plastic lining ripped at the zipper within two months (really not that big a deal it as the bag still functioned, but still...) and then the strap came unstitched where it attaches to the bag at 4 months. I used the bag heavily, the baby and I have been on the go every day since he was born, but I feel it really should have held up better than this. The little bag got used maybe twice, so getting this product for that reason wasn't such a good idea. The Graco bag also is not nearly as well designed from an organization stand point as the one we are using now. I wish I had done more comparison shopping before registering for this product, and didnt let myself be swayed by the cute pattern."
1,Are you freaking kidding me?,This movie is TERRIBLE for one reason and one reason only. No Robert Englund. I hated this new guy in Watchmen and after seeing this I think he deserves to be shot. How dare he think he could handle this role. There is only one Freddy.
1,Terrible.,"I hated this remake. 10 times worse than the Friday the 13th remake. It has NOTHING of what made the original a classic. The story and cast are boring and generic, and the guy playing Freddy is no where near as effective as Robert Englund. Terrible."
4,great remake,"i watched this movie expecting to be dissappointed just like the rest of the horror remakes. i was suprised at the end of the movie of how great it was, it goes into detail about freddy and also keeps some of the story line from the original. i was pleasently suprised with it, it was very good."
3,Had Some Flaws But A Decent Remake,"A retelling of the man of your dreams, the infamous burnt face Freddy Kruegar, who can kill you in your dreams with his razor sharp knives for fingers. Focusing more this time on the back story of Freddy, he is burned alive by the parents after commiting child abuse at the pre school he worked at and years later is now getting revenge at the children that told on him. Its up to Nancy to confront her fears and defeat Freddy once and for all. I liked that they gave more background to the Freddy charector in this film, jackie earle haley is alright in the role of Freddy, hes darker and creepy as hell. Not as good as the original, had some plot holes (the film was highly edited and was much longer, the producers were scared to release that version and went the safe route) but its a decent watch."
4,"It's a remake, oh my god","First off, I need to tell the readers I've grown up on the Nightmare on Elm St. series with Robert Englund from the first with Depp's feature appearance to New Nightmare. Now with that being said, here is my consensus about the new re-make. When I heard Englund wasn't in it, yes I was disappointed but looked at the positive side:-When I heard the re-make involved Jackie Earle Haley as the horror icon, Fred I was happy. If they were to have another actor to be Fred, it would 100% be Haley.-I looked as this as a RE-MAKE. Not a sequel. This is a standalone Freddy film.-It was the most serious side of the of the classic franchise.Overall I thought the film was excellent in it's own rights being that this isn't a sequel, but a modern version of the story."
2,Nightmare On Bored Street,"Boring,underwhelming remake that needed a jolt of energy but better than 4, 5,and 6 though, Haley couldn't fill the shoes of Englund, it was a sad attempt, even when the movies were bad Englund put his all into the role of Freddy. Watch once out of curiosity."
5,i loved it,i thought it was good really enjoyed it saw it 2 times have no complaints other than i want more to see the scences that where deleted and see a sequel
4,"Vince Gerardi songs for ""Peanuts""","A nice compendium of the best-loved Vince Guaraldi-composed songs commonly used in the ""Peanuts"" TV program. If Charles Schultz approved, how can I do less?"
5,mens reebok strapless heart rate monitor fit-watch,an excellent product for working out in the gym;especially for cycling and circuit training. The seller informed me that there would be a delay in delivery as he had to order new stock in.The product arrived by courier in very good condition.I would definately deal with this seller again.
2,WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT!,"I KNOW THERE WILL BE ALOT OF ""HAG"" FANS THAT SAY IM WRONG..BUT THE ONLY THING ABOUT THIS BOX SET THAT IS GOOD IS QUALITY...I SAY THA BECAUSE ITS MISSING A LOT OF HIS NUMBER ONE HITS..THE THING THAT IS FUNNY IS IN THE BOOKLET THERE IS A PICTURE OF THE LP ""THE ROOTS OF MY RAISING""PAGE 70 AND THE SONG IS NOT ON THE SET..HEY IT MADE NUMBER ONE!ALSO NOT THERE -CHEROKEE MAIDEN--BAR ROOM BUDDIES-MOVIN ON-YESTERDAYS WINE-GOING WHERE THE LONELY GO-A PLACE TO FALL APART-NATURAL HIGH---IF I WOULD OF HAD MY LIST WHEN I WENT TO THE STORE--I WOULD HAVE SAVED THE 50.00---BECAUSE I WOULD NOT OF BOUGHT THIS...SHAME ON YOU CAPITOL! THIS SHOUD OF INCLUDED ALL HIS BEST! MY OPINION"
2,I was very disappointed,"I have to say with this book. While it seems like everyone else here thought it was wonderful, for me it offered very little pet advice and tons on showing and competition. I was looking for a book on how to raise a shih tzu as a pet and I have zero interest in breeding or showing, which are the groups for whom this book seems to have been written. If that's your goal then I wholely recommend it (which is why I gave the two stars rather than one), but if you're like me and the 98% of shih tzu owners who are looking for a pet based book, there are many better ones out there (for much less money, might I add!)."
2,The Black Kenny G. Yuck,Najee is as bland as Kenny G.I wonder why on earth would he try to mess up one of the Greatest Albums ever made?i have heard Najee for years&it still puts me to sleep easily.he plays a few instruments but they lack feeling&soul.i hear he is touring with Prince now.if he does Prince Like he does on this disc then there will be alot of Sleepy heads.Elevator Music at it's most basic forum.i wish Roy Hargrove would take this Project maybe then somebody would BLow into that Horn instead of Noodle.if it weren't for this being the Album that it is i would give it a one.
3,so here it is...,"this is very informative on many levels. However, in 1997 there was hardly the selection of online brokerage companies that there are today. After much review, i ended up going through Scottrade which offers online trades at just $7, plus useful tools to help me analyze my trade info. Use referral code YVCF9745 to get 3 free trades after starting new account."
4,Sturdy and well built for the price,"This bench is well built for the price, but could have been a bit better. The wheels, as stated in other reviews, are largely useless as you have to have it almost perpendicular to the floor to use them. The bench does not wobble even when I use my Selecttech 1090 dumbells (I am 200lbs plus the 180lb for the dumbells). Using the decline bench is great for your chest and is something you may not even be able to do at your gym."
5,bowflex selecttech bench,"This bench is basic but does all I need. Both the seat and the back are adjustable with the back going from from vertical to past horizonal (so that your head is lower than your feet. It is plenty wide which is a complaint about some benchs. It is heavy enough to be stable, but not difficult to move with the built in wheels. I would recommend this bench as a good bargain and a good complement to any home gym if you use weights."
1,The thing is not sturdy!,The thing is not sturdy and feels cheap. It wobbles over time because of the poor design...where the various level notches are placed.I would not recommend. I only purchased this b/c I was buying the adjustable dumbbells at the same time.The customer service and warranty are also worthless. Spend your money elsewhere.I replaced with far superior bench that was half the price.
4,Easy to use,"This bench is very nice and appears to be made very well. It is solid, stable and easy to adjust."
4,2 issues otherwise...,i'm pretty happy with the product with 1 large complaint and 1 small complaint. the big complaint is the wheels. unless i assembled it wrong it doesn't roll and i store it in a separate room from where i workout making it especially annoying. if you aren't going to move it this won't be a problem. the small problem is the separation between the two paddings. most people really hate it but I've worked out on much worse so i only consider it a mild inconvenience. oh there is a third problem the way the pad is angled when i do tricep dips my hands don't feel solid or even. the bench itself is solid and i would recommend it to anyone despite my minor complaints. i was lucky enough to get it free with the purchase of the weights so i guess if i spent 250 i might be a little more angered but again i would recommend.
2,A stinker.,"One of my least favorite Tull albums, Too Old would be a total disaster if not for the title track (which is a classic) and Taxi Grab. The follow-up album was Songs From The Wood which is superb."
3,OK......,"I think the jedi apprentice books are the best and they keep getting better, accept this one. I thought it would be more exiting like the other ones, but this one was too strange. All these little books are really one chapter compared to the other 11 books. Buy it, see how you like it, but its not as good as the other ones."
4,The hero generation,"Matheson lays down a solid war novel. The characters of the iconic rifle squad are varied, flawed and interestingly introspective. Hack evolves as I thought he might to guide the next batch of cherries into the bloody brotherhood of combat."
5,2400w Drum Cartridge,"I was having printing problems with my Konica 2400w printer, so I ordered a new drum for it. The product was just as described, was shipped quickly, and work flawlessly. I would definitely buy again."
2,The payoff in volume 3 is really weak,"The premise and much of the action was good throughout the series, but after wading through 1500 pages, I could not believe how lame the ending was. It would be unfair to reveal the ending, so I will not do so.The ending reminded me of a bad mystery story where the killer was a new character introduced in the last 50 pages.I think Hamilton must have run out of ideas.If you believe that it is the journey and not the destination, then go ahead and read these books. They are in the pulp fiction style of several plots that more or less merge at the end."
3,A fast and loose plot ruins an otherwise great series.,"The first book in this series, The Reality Disfunction: Emergence, was a tour de force. Then, in the subsequent novels,things take a turn for the worse with ""souls"" of the dead coming back from purgatory (?!) to take over the unsuspecting living (and to insult the unsuspecting reader). This story is like a cross between The Science Fiction Channel's ""Sightings"" and your average supermarket tabloid. Too bad, because Peter Hamilton is an otherwise great writer and the degeneration of what could have been THE science fiction series into pedantic schlock is an insult to even the semi-rational."
1,Skip These and Look at Professional Series,"The cutting boards are not half inch thick as advertised; they measure approximately 9 mm thick. The boards are also not very flat; they are a bit cupped on the back side. In summary, the boards are not only misrepresented but also of poor manufacturing quality. Even for the low price they are not worth buying as they would flex during use due to the cupping and could not even be turned over to use the other side because the board would then rock.FYI - I also ordered some of their 14 inch ""Professional"" line which I like and can say are nice thick flat boards, so have a look at them and skip these."
3,Luminescence,The lights are attractive. But they do not give adequate lighting to illuminate the steps that are a foot away.
4,Close Encounters: Proof of Alien Contact by Kobie Lyons,"Once you see these UFOs captured on tape, you don't need a narrator or eye-witness accounts to convince you something extraordinary is in the skies. I'm not convinced by the surgery portion of this doc. because the findings of that doctor were effectively challeged on a Sci-Fi network show, but as a skeptic, the videos will certainly open your eyes.I think there is definitely something going on with UFO's, Crop Circles, etc and I think the American Government is as trustworthy as Al Capone on LSD, but poor evidence doesn't shed light on the Truth. We need good science and good evidence."
2,Too stiff and complicated,"Too many straps, too big (too high on torso), too uncomfortable. Returned it. Not happy with this purchase. Vvv vvv"
1,This is NOT for an SCP-4700 it is for a 4900,Although it clearly states that it is an SCP-4700 what they will send you is a 4900. It took 2 weeks to get a response from the seller and after returning the product instead of getting the correct one they issued a refund so I lost 3 weeks and all shipping charges.
4,TON READ AGAIN,A reason I really like TON is they have a new sound I haven't heard before. This disk had several and were really different. A few songs could have been a bit shorter though.
3,Not expected,Although the deep tones of Peter Steele are back in this album... his use of prozac must be slipping. I prefer the songs of Ocotber Rust and Bloody Kisses myself... but this album is an ok addition to your Type O collection.
3,They're baaaacckkk.,"I don't know for sure,but I was a little brought down because when you knocked,I thought you were the candyman.I am not really gripping the reality of this new CD,but unfortunately I find this new outing a bit too much like the previous ones.After 4 years something new might have grown up out of Mr.Steeles depression....."
2,Type O in their mediocre mode,"Well it seems that Type O Negative are back in their mediocre mode which means that the Dead Again is an album of long, overwrought and confused songs that really needed a) to be tightened up and focused or b) left on the cutting room floor or in a notebook of song ideas to be revisited. Some fans love this kind of album because it's edgy (ooh!) but not me. Go buy October Rust or World Coming Down."
3,Mary Magdalene,"I found the book a credible, enlightening, and encouraging presentation of the Gospel of Mary Magdalene. I'd like more like this book."
5,Chynna Phillips has TONS of talent!! This album proves it!!,"That fact that Chynna Phillips had a hand in writing 9 of 11 songs on this album doesn't surprise me one bit. Especially when you find out that her parents were the founding members of the Mamas & The Papas. And after listening to this album, it's become obvious to me that Chynna's inherited their talent. MAN!! This album rocks!! From the first song to the last, there's not one song on this album that I don't like. I definitely got my money's worth when I got this album.Reuben K.Honolulu, HI"
1,Made with MSG,MSG- If you like cooking with MSG this rub is for you. I'm not an anti-MSG crusader but I was shocked to see it on the ingredient list of a high-end BBQ rub. Because it's such a small item it wasn't worth returning for a refund so I put it in the swap shop at my dump. Took a small taste before I did that - it was a little sweeter than I like a dry rub. I prefer to add sweetness with sauce.
2,slightly off,This looks nice and was a good price but it does not keep very acurate records. In the morning it's usually about 5 degrees below actual published temperature and in the daytime about 5 degrees over.
4,I never knew who I was until I read this book.,This was the most amazing piece of work dealing with shame based personalities that I had ever read. While reading this book I found many answers to questions that I have been asking myself for years and was never able to find. Also the recovery methods that were described were the most helpful then all the other self help books combined. When I started reading this book I started to cry and continued crying all through the book. When I finished reading the tears did not stop because I was so sad that I finished this book.
1,I did not like it at all. I think it was very bad,"I think the content was horrible and everything was false. I belive the writer is not very good one, and the book seems to not understand the problems we are all going through."
5,bruce willis on fire,"this composer did a lot considering the fact that bruce willis wouldn't let him make the movie. . . . this is an amazing soundtrack. there are plenty of better thing you could be doing with your time. it's good, but it lets you down. i'm hopeful that maybe they'll be a sequel and that this composer can do the best he can."
1,Hard to find in stores,I looked at 5 different stores before I decided to check on line. I had it in 4 days. Sooooo much easier than going to the store.R
3,Worked Fine,Only issue here is that they are made in China. I guess I expected more from AC Delco but then everything is made in China these days.
1,Too Much Detail Not Enough Story.,Wow this book is tedious. I didnt need to hear about every single meeting that Lewis and Clark had with the Indians; an overview would have been enough. It was interesting that the Native Americans had there own economy and trade relationships. Why wouldnt they? Maybe Jefferson should have sent along a few bankers because L&C seemed to be oblivious. I would have loved this book had the author expanded on the realtionships between tribes both commercial and cultural and used Lewis and Clark as a vehicle to move that story along but this book reads like minutes from Chamber of Commerce meetings. I gave up after 90 pages.
4,a great book for ecletic wiccans,I only gave her for stars because she sees wicca and witchcraft as the samething when they arent. however i really enjoyed how she covered alot of areas and did it throughly. She didnt just skim over one area and then skip to the next. Her part about the sabbats were excellent as was the dos and donts of the spells. i reccomend this book to electic wiccans very highly.
2,WAS MY BOOK PRINTED BACKWARDS?,"I bought this for my coffee table for my Cowan friends to flip though. Then just recentley I picked it up and read through it. OK. For 10 years I've been practicing and some times I have occasionally goofed up but I was taught you always called the quarters first then the Gods. Other rituals I attend do this the same way so I was concerned to see this book laying out ritual in this matter. It is not to learn ritual from. The four quarters are our guardians. Why proceed to do ritual/magick with out their protection first? I know a lot of traditions but know none that don't ""Lay the red carpet out"" first before calling the Gods. Know who and WHY you are calling! Magick happens! The other parts are nice but it's too bad people are learing to do ritual this way."
5,Say No More... This is the CD for YOU !!,"This is by far Clay's best music !!! This cd has emotional ballads like ""Say No More"" and ""Real"" then heart melting love songs like ""You Deliver Me"" and ""So Much More"" then on top of that, you get fun songs like ""La Bamba"", ""I Love It"" and ""Texas Swing""This is the only cd that will wrestle Terri Clark's ""Fearless"" for playing time in my stereo!!!! THANKS CLAY For WONDERFUL new music !!"
3,"Love Amazon, but...",due to shipping costs you're better off looking for it locally. Napa Autoparts is the only consistent supplier - but call first b/c there are a few of us that (now) know this secret.
5,good,"This is a great cd, I don't write english very well, so, I just want to heard, to see if this album is that I want."
4,easy-to-read book on prayer for either groups or individuals,"i knew a lot of this stuff already, but it was still a good read (in 1 sitting!) i especially liked the anecdotes (i get snoozy when a book doesn't have enough anecdotes!) & the way she broke intercessory prayer down into easy-to-remember steps (which makes it pretty much foolproof -- ANYONE could lead a small prayer group using her method -- it's so easy!) i also really appreciated her sensitivity in dealing with shy pray-ers (rule #1: NEVER force them to pray out loud!), since i have always been a shy pray-er myself (& shy everything else -- public speaking has never been my forte -- but prayer is my passion, so i endure ... )"
3,Ok read,"This book was ok, but not really that much depth to it. It also leaves more questions than answers, which is usually a good thing, but in this instance it wasn't. I had just read the watchmen before I read this so it seemed pretty weak."
3,It's okay but many of these reviews are suspicious,"The stiff did not kill my cat, her head did not fall off and she didn't go psycho on me either. But putting it on her it left a greasy spot on her neck that I needed up washing off later on during he day.And as to the other reviews....when you read titles like ""Dangerous"" or ""Killed my cat and 20 others in the neighborhood! Stop Sergeants before they kill again"" from reviews who have only that review on Amazon one has to be skeptical."
2,too thin ... like water,"When applying a flea product to the back of your cat's head/neck you need it to stay in the general area it's applied. If it doesn't the cat will turn it's head around and lick it away. This product is so much like water that is spreads out all over and runs down the cat's back. You have to apply Sergeants Silver Flea and Tick a few drops at a time and then wait for it to dry, then apply a little more to keep it from dripping/running all over. It takes about 4 or 5 applications. My cat still licked it all over. Bad."
1,DONT USE!!!!!,"Do not use this product on your animals, it is a pesticide and very toxic, whether injested or not. We used the appropriate amount of the dog stuff for out dogs and they got very sick within a few hours after putting it on. Our older dog was having trouble with his back end and was in a lot of pain, my younger dog was having horrible muscles spasims. Within 20 minutes of wash our dogs with dawn dish soap they werent in as much pain, but were still having trouble for a few days. When we contacted the company they didnt seem to care. Do not purchase this product it needs to be taken off the market!"
3,Red Cherry...,"The cover and the story are definitely two different things. I won't give the story away, but please rent this if you can before you choose to buy it...that's all I'll say on this one...3 stars for the acting"
4,Indoor Bonsai Figurine,Item is intended as an indoor Bonsai figurine. It is unglazed. Although this is an attractive detailed figurine it may not exhibit the type of durability as a glazed figurine. Otherwise good for intended use as a plant decoration.
3,Only in Spanish and in Widescreen,"I just purchased this, came new Sealed.Has no Menu, and only plays in Spanish and only in 16x9 Widescreen. Be warned, it might have been re-issued."
5,Great Book - Very Educational,Very well written and formatted for those of us with very little or no previous oil and gas related experience. Covers all the bases and allows the reader to see how prospects are identified and analyzed and the hydrocarbons recovered and marketed. Recommended for all those wanting to learn more about the industry.
4,Good introduction to oil and gas,"This book is useful for anyone who would like to learn more about the world of oil and gas in non-technical language. It doesn't go into nearly enough detail, but I am biased, having worked in the oil and gas industry for a number of years. However, it does help greatly explain the amazing technology and science behind what drives our cars, homes, and the things we buy."
2,Porn in Print?!!.........NOT FOR THE PRUDISH!!,"When I read the first few pages I too indeed was shocked, and didn't know whether to read on or put the book down!!!!(I lent the book to a friend, and after reading a few pages, she returned it to me LOL!!!)The story was easy to follow at first, but then I got lost in the voodoo of it all!Amongst the numerous orgies and voodoo surrealism, I'm afraid I lost the plot of where the story was heading, if anywhere at all!(I had quite a laugh reading the other reviews!!)"
2,Poor Man's Beach Boys...,"If you'd like to hear a couple of discs of the Surfaris abandoning their wonderful original sound and style and trying to sound like the Beach Boys then by all means, pick this one up.Personally I'd rather pop in a copy of their excellent ""Surf Party"" and get to the real stuff.It's not that this music isn't well played, just that it had all been done before. This isn't what made the Surfaris great! I think they realized this later, and it definately shows in the live ""Surf Party"" CD which I believe was recorded 6 or 7 years after these two disappointing efforts.Steer clear of this one and save your money for something real."
3,the Greatest Show on Earth,"We were there in Sin City on opening night of the Popmart Tour back in 97. The excitement in the air as the house lights are turned down and the remix of ""Pop Muzik"" is captured perfectly as the crowd erupts and parts like the Red Sea as the champion enters the ring surrounded by his entourage...wait...its Bono in a boxer's robe...what an incredible sight. Mofo powerfully starts the show followed by ""I Will Follow""...the set itself was spectacular and unforgetable. the 70 foot golden arch, the Huge ""Spaceship Lemon"", and the incredible video and remix of that song....wow, what a night....the only thing missing was Mephisto....wait until you see the Starship lemon open up in mid-concert...this is the ultimate concert video and the most incredible show I've been to yet...lets see if they out-do themselves on this years tour."
4,Great Gooly Mooly!,"Not to crazy about the Spanish language,but Bono's got it down somewhat.From the balzing remix of Pop Muzik to the slow and mournful dedication of ""Oneto Michael Hutchence,this seems to be one of the best U2 films I have seen.This might also be the only concert you'll ever see Edge mess up on.Over all this concert is a smart buy if you are a HUGE U2 Fan!"
3,NOT BAD BUT THE CHARACTERS . . .,"As many other people think, I thought it was a bit unrealistic when none of Jessica and Elizabeth's friends were transfered. Half the school being transfered was just bull. Elizabeth is typically falling for the dumbest guy in the school: Salvador. I mean, he doesn't have any thing else to do but fantasize about Elizabeth. Jessica is being superficial when she receives a death wish of having someone DORKY for a locker partner. Anna spills tales of woe about this brother Tim. I wish she had some other things to say.I rated this book three stars because the characters are despicable."
2,"If you love Sweet Valley Twins, beware of this book!!!","I thought that the twins should not have been rezoned. I twas a HORRIBLE idea! Or at least some of the twins' friends should have been rezoned with them! I mean, what happened to Todd and Elizabeth? Jessica and Aaron! And what happened to all of Jessica's and Elizabeth's friends?! Couldn't like at least 2or 3 of the twins' friends be transferred to SVJH?!"
1,Way unrealistic!,I thought this was a really unrealistic book. One star was way too much! I find it hard to believe that only such a little amount of people were rezoned. Besides what is with this big change?! What's next Jessica and Elizabeth living on the street! If you liked Sweet Valley Twins stay away from this STUPID book!
1,Yuck! Beware! =(,"*crying* I loved the Sweet Valley Twins! They were the best series ever! But this... I mean it isn't that bad moving to a new middle school! All the charectors in the new books are aliens. Really! Not at all loveable. The old charectors were soooo fun and you could feel their thoughts and feelings. I miss Amy, Todd, Maria, Julie, Lila, Janet, Tamara, Kimberly, Mandy, Grace, Belinda, Aaron, Bruce, Rick, Lois, Winston, Ken, Patrick, Sophia, and so on. Readers from Montana and Oregon I salute you!"
2,In Hindsite ...,Save your money ... get your lip balm at the local Wal-Mart. Expensive (plus S&H) and not worth the extra money for the musician's 'chops'.
3,Excellent conclusion to a great story,Scores out of 100.Jedi apprentice book 1-8 : 85-95 (depending on which book)Jedi apprentice book 9-13: 50-85 (depending on which book)The Jenna Zan Arbor story: started with a 80 and ends with a 50.
5,joints don't hold up,"The chair is extremely comfortable, especially since I am very tall. It takes a few minutes to put together and doesn't fit back into the case well, but not too bad. The cushion does collect hair, dust, etc. But while the frame is aluminum, the joints are rubber; one of the joints on mine broke after very limited, gentle use over just a year and cannot easily be repaired, rendering the chair unuseable. I don't know if this is a defect in the chair, or if it is a common problem."
4,Better than the old version...,I was very pleased with this chair as I also have an older version which suffered from a broken swivel at the front. This version features a new design of frame which seems a lot sturdier and is just as comfortable as the old one. Highly recommended...
4,A Strong Start.,"Griswold-Ford's first novel was a refreshing departure from my normal fare. The mix of magic and modern technology felt natural, as if it were the natural state of things. Nikki Jeffries and her other characters are well constructed and the plot moves along well. If Valerie Griswold-Ford continues to write novels such as this, we are in for some terrific reading."
5,The Lead Sled,"Finally got tos use this for the first time to signt in my .300 win mag and a 7mm WSM. WOW! Assembly was a snap and I used two 25 lb. dumbells, one on either side of the center rod. Worked flawlessy. Adjustments were easy and it really can eliminate a lot of errors. Worked perfectly with the Caldwell Stable Table. Very impressed!"
3,"Promising, but does not age well.","I lived in NYC in 1998-99, and September 11 hit me pretty hard. Pete Hamill lived through it just days after he'd ""finished"" Forever, and he re-wrote much of it to capture the tragedy in literature. Cormac, his hero, embodies the mythic hero completely. Hamill loves the City and it shows in every word. I wanted more in between the American Revolution and the fall of the Towers, but its quite a read as is. I loved it completely when I first read it, but a little distance makes me think just one more re-write would have really tightened up the changed ending. Enjoy this historic trip through this most wonderful city."
3,"A tale for a child, writtin for an adult.","Although a great novel and very creative, the book fails to get inside the characters. Also, it seems as if Pete Hamill wrote two stories and then combined them without transition. None the less, very historically accurate and a great read."
3,I felt let down,"It took me forever to read ""Forever"", mostly because the first 150 pages were soooo well written that I kept re-reading them. Mr. Hamill captured the young Cormac O'Connor so vividly that I felt his suffering as my own. However, too many years were skipped after the late 1800's. As for Cormac's final love, Delfina, I thought she was the worst choice! She had no class and obviously no loyalty to Cormac, as she proved by hopping into bed with her boss for no apparent reason. She was my greatest disappointment. 911 could and should have been left out. I can't imagine that I would shower first before searching for the love of my life after the attack. Maybe just splash a little water on my face. Not very realistic, there. I'm still recommending it. It has great New York City history."
3,Ok... but very uneven,"I must admit this is a hard book to rate. Parts I enjoyed as much as any book that I have ever read (The images of Ireland in the 1700s). Then there are other parts that left me disgusted ... such as the year that was spent at a brothel painting VERY initimate portraits of the ""workers"".The story as a whole is a great one. One man living nearly 300 years who has the oppurtunity to see the city of New York grow. Some have called it an ambitious task- but I don't quite see it that way... in fact I wish that Hamill had spent more time on the ""details"" of the development of New York and less time on trying to paint the ""good"" side of Boss Tweed. Instead what we get is a bit of a rollercoaster ride of the good and the bad with very little connecting either. So in the end I give ""Forever"" an A+ for concept but only about a C or its execution."
1,Disappointing,"Yes. The author can write well. In the technical aspect. But the story felt dead and it seemed like I was dragging my feet reading it just to get through. And worst of all, the thing that made me keep reading was the GOAL that he had set out to accomplish! and then the ending! Good grief. The MOST anticlimactic ending I have ever read."
4,almost great,"fine story - loved the main character...too bad that he was burdened with the stupidest, most hole-filled, hurried, ridiculous ending ever. it's a heck of a tale, but ""happily ever after?"" come on, we're all adults here, what really happens to Cormac O'Connor?"
4,Just a regular text book,"Not much to review. It's a decent text book, includes chapter summaries of each chapter for quick reference during class. Easy to find key words, good extra features and articles. A well written text book."
2,OK but other books cover the same ground,"The design basics in this book are covered as well in other books. I know, because when I signed up for an interior design class at a local junior college, the textbook was The New Decorating Book put out by Better Homes and Gardens. It covers balance, scale, and so on and also includes furniture templates for furniture arranging. And it has hundreds of excellent color pictures."
4,A Long Awaited Portfolio,"Having grown up in roadrunner country, I've always had a fondness for these unusual birds. One of my major complaints about existing literature on the species was the lack of good roadrunner photographs -- now that void has been filled by Wyman Meinzer. The highlight of this book is that it's a pictorial record of the roadrunner from every angle: hatching to hunting to breeding to nesting. The accompanying text provides a running commentary on what the pictures show. All in all, an excellent addition to the personal library of any bird watcher."
1,Not worth the money,Not at all what I was expecting. Had I known the was just a documentary about Wandering Wolf's live I would not have bought it. It really had little to do with the year zero.
4,Dragon slayers,"The book I'll tell you about is DragonSlayers. It is a book I really recommend. Eventhough it doesn't have a lot of illustrations. It gives a bunch of detail so that you can make a picture in your head.Introductoin:When Grizelda decides to get revenge on King Mildred,she dosen't go half-way.She makes the fiercest dragon ever seen.Now someone has to kill the thing,but the knights are all to frightened,wich leaves the job to an old squire,young page boy,and the mostwilful princess whoever straps on the sword. The question is Can they stop arguing enough to face the greatest battle of all?"
3,Poor editing,"I don't get one thing about this DVD - why was it done over two nights? When you play it, the first thing to come up is some video guy named Mitchell who's like ""When the boys asked me to film their concert, I knew the only way to do it was over two nights"" or something like that. That's funny, the Live Without a Net concert was filmed over one night. For that reason, it's much better, seeing as how the band member's wardrobes don't change in the blink of an eye, and the music is actually up to sync with the video."
3,A Good Resource,"Photographers need to know the principles in this well-written and straightforward book. However, it has not been updated in some time, and the laws do keep changing in this area. It might be good to find something more up-to-date to rely on as a resource."
4,"terrific, informative program","I actually purchased this video from my local flyshop, but was pleased to find it on Amazon as well.I found the video to be very well done and extremely informative. I watched it before I went on a trip to Belize and expanded my trip to go to the ruins that were featured in the program, but never mentioned by my outfitter.Kelly Watt's enthusiasm even encouraged my wife to get interested in fly fishing and I can honestly say the Watt's video's are some of the very best I have seen.Now that my wife is involved in fly fishing, because of watching Kelly fish, we spend a lot more days together enjoying each other's company as well as fly fishing.My wife purchased the Bonefish School and Striper School, video's produced by the Watt's, and we both have learned a great deal from them."
4,Gentle & Long Lasting,"I use The Purpose Cleansing Bar for my face only. I have real oily skin and this works very well to combat against the oil. I find it to be more effective than some of the liguid gels I've bought. Compared to the others, it is very economical...it lasts a long time."
2,Tiny heating pad,"I have a larger older dog who greatly benefits from a warm bed in the winter.The actual heating pad on this item is small. About 12""x12"". It is unclear how this small heating pad is supposed to warm a 30""x40"" pet bed. And even taking the pad out of the bed it doesn't get all that warm. Disappointing."
4,Nice dog bed,"Well ... it's like this, My one dog love her nice warm bed and used it 3 day till my otherdog got a mean streak and tore it up. It was a great bed while it lasted . Met all myexpectations. Would buy another one but I don't think I'm going to give him anotherone to tare up. lol"
1,Buy it elsewhere,"I ordered Frankie Beverly and Maze ""Anthology"", but I recieved a different set than what I ordered... I will NEVER use this site again...."
3,BILLY IN SYNTH ROCK GEAR,"Whiplash Smile came out some 4 years after the smash hit ""Rebel Yell"" showing Billy Idol in a more mature music mode.With guitarist Steve Stevens, Billy showed that he still had the hooks, the melodies and the snarl. ""Don't Need A Gun"" and ""World's Forgotten Boy"" are all pretty rock-ahead tracks. ""Sweet 16"" is a nice ballad.""Whiplash Smile"" suffers from being too slick - even with Stevens' crackling guitar. Too many synths and drum machines underscore this production. It sounds fine, but it lacks the raw kick and dimension of ""Rebel Yell. Although Billy's voice rocks, the background's cruising - blunting the overall edge.I'm not sure why Stevens, Idol and producer Keith Forsey decided to go the minimalist musician route, but it shows. There are some nice songs here, but they never quite get into hit mode.This is a hard album to rate. Somewhere between 3.5 to 4 stars. You can get it but you probably won't miss it - the best tracks are on Billy's hit compilations."
3,excellent for younger babies,"I wish I would have gotten this DVD sooner, as I know it would have mesmerized my daughter when she was 3-6 months old (as did Baby Mozart and Baby Bach). Now (10 months) she prefers videos with puppet interaction - adores, for example, Baby Faith ""God Made Music"". Still, this is an excellent tool for quiet down time, early mornings (when Mom really needs to drink her coffee), or just uplifting background music while she plays with her toys. Well done, well thought out, well presented."
1,Brand new sound effects do not a good DVD make...,"While the picture quality of this disc is fantastic, the sound leaves little to be desired. The producers of this disc decided to completely redo the sound effects. They sound out of place and very new. The music and dialogue are the original and are very faint. Mixing all of the elements together leaves one feeling a little disjointed. Not a good DVD!!!"
5,Great f**king album,"Murphy rules, and you know it. Great album...I bought this the day it came out, and it gets better after each listen. At first I preferred Convergence, but I realized this is the work of a true artist who has only just begun to come into his own. Enveloping many styles, such as Jazz, Death Metal, Progressive Rock, Hard Rock, and thrash, this is an amazing acheivement. It even has spanish and blues influences that work to accent his songwriting genius. Best songs-Epoch and Race With the Devil on the Spanish Highway (a cover of an Al DiMeola tune)"
3,Good keybox - but small mechanical problem,"After more than 2 weeks of slow shipping from amazon, I finally recieved this lockbox. The box works great except the number 1 push button sticks a little. Also, lets say your combination is 1234, you can enter the numbers in any order until you get the right combination. So, you could put in 2413 or 1324, etc and it will open when you get the 4 right numbers. Still satisfied with my purchase, for the most part. Not satisfied about paying $6 shipping via USPS and not getting it for 2 weeks."
1,"Just as others have said, they send the WRONG CABLE!","This is supposed to be a M>F extension cable. What you will get is a M>M Long Cable. Yes it's long, but it's not an extension cable! Even the title says M/F, but it's M/M. It does not look like the cable pictured which is M/F."
3,Written for academics,"If you are looking for a studious history of foul language, this book might be for you. Everything in author Hughes' book is well documented and footnoted. In my research for my own book, CUSS CONTROL (Three Rivers Press, April 2000), I purchased the 1993 edition of this book. It contained some valuable information, but I found it difficult to read. The author was, and perhaps still is, a professor in South Africa, and his writing style is intellectual and formal. His intention and his audience are different from mine, so a comparison is not really fair. However, unless you are looking for a comprehensive and esoteric study of the use of profanity through the ages, I suggest you page through the book before making a purchase."
5,I am the king of the echo people!,"There are so many great quotes from this movie. You can't get creepier and weirder than this classic without going overboard. *spoiler* If you don't throw up easily (I'm thinking of the drinking of dead cat water) and love flinging platform shoes at people, then this movie is for you.One word for the distributors:MAKE THIS AVAILABLE ON DVD!!!"
4,A great effort,"This CD is, in my opinion, Delerium's best one. It is a departure from their earlier more trance-like music, but I think that is perfect. There are many trance, techno, and dark-tech bands outh there, but this kind of dark jungle/medieval music is extremely rare. Many die-hard Delerium fans don't like this depature from the origional, and I can see that, but what they changed to is much better."
3,Rather miscellaneous,"I have liked all the Ambler books I have read, but this one seems rather, er, miscellaneous. It's not BAD, just not up to his usual standard."
4,good family flick,"This is a great example of how children's movies are becoming great for everyone. Terrific animation, and good humor throughout."
2,Say no to the wig,I thought this deal was cute. Wrong. The movie is fun but the wig stinks!!!!First the wig comes vacuumed packed in a box the same as the DVD.Second when you try to fluff it up it falls apart.So you are better off just getting the DVD!!
4,Circus,Good Story. The characters are on there game. The action was top notch. The music was right on the note. Better than the second movie and equal to the first.
5,Great movie,"Probably not as good as the first two, but still great family entertainment. Kids loved it. There were songs that came in the movie which I thought should have gone on longer. King Julian has a reduced role which was a bummer."
3,fun and funny,It was a good family movie. Great jokes for adults as well. Great graphics and voices. Good clean fun. I would recommend.
4,the bear on the ducati did it for me.,"Not astonishing, but fervent tribute to the characters in the earlier flicks. Entertaining and definitely worth watching, esp with the French slams."
3,Fun for kids,"The third and hofpefully last in the seris, was about redemption, and friendship. Both good things for young kids to learn but the storylines were confusted and somewhat convoluted."
4,Not as good as the first and second,Its a good movie but not like the first two. The rainbow wig that comes with it is a joke.
3,Great Movie But...,"The movie is great but the digital copy by paramount is a pain. You have to go through multiple steps to install the digital copy which requires you to create a paramount account accept multiple forms of ""marketing"" and then you can download it. Seriously? Just let me download the movie without having to jump through a hundred hoops."
5,Keeps you upbeat,As with all the Madagascar movies the music is very upbeat and keeps a smile on your face. Great movie to watch with the kids
4,Amazing movie,This movie had great video and ok sound quality. We used a home theater to watch the movie which improved the sound.
3,Don't Make Madagascar 4,"Movie was good, enjoyed many moments of it, however, did not think it was a funny as its predecessors. Hopefully no further sequels in this series."
3,Madagascar3,"This movie was o.k. if you were 12 years old or younger. I really enjoyed the first two, but feel this one was a waste of my time."
4,Super fun!,"The kids loved all the color and music, only gave it minus one star for the length. It was a bit long for my taste. Dragged on in some parts! Kids didn't notice though so overall a hit :)"
3,It was okay.,"This story continues abruptly from where it left off in Africa. We had just established Alex's family in Africa, however, he leaves without much acknowledgement of them. From there we go to Europe where some fun ensues and the team joins the circus. Relationships between the group aren't covered much in this movie... maybe because so many new characters are introduced. Also missing is the grandmother from the first two films. It felt weird not having her there to make an appearance and help complete the trilogy. The movie was fine but it didn't seem to have the heart of the other two."
1,Another silly kid movie,"These are not my favorite movies, but my granddaughters think they are hilarious. They sing the polka-dot afro song alot!"
4,Grandkids loved it,It was way better than the first two. More adventures of the Zoo animals trying to get home. They expended more energy on special effects than on story line but it was fun.
3,Not as funny,First two movies were a lot funnier. I like the characters but they seem to have run out of jokes for this movie. It was just okay.
4,Much better than what you would expect from a third sequel,"Story was good, no regurgitation of earlier stories. And penguins are always at their wittiest self. Monkeys were great as well."
5,Great,"Great movie, great quality. Kids loved it and were happy to get it. Unfortunately found it cheaper at Target after I ordered it, but not worth returning at that point."
3,Madagascar 3,"My daughter didn't sit through this one despite loving the 1st Madagascar. I would say it was just okay, and we would rather watch the previous Madagascars."
2,For small children only,Madagascar (1) was novel and had enough clever humor to engage adults. (2) and (3) are silly retreads without enough to entertain adults or even older children.
1,Forced previews!,"I absolutely hate dvds that force you to watch previews and ads. I PAID for this dvd and I have to watch commercials EVERY time I watch it. Not just other movies, but TV shows and stage events, as well."
5,Epic,It was an interesting movie it was funny and well detailed it was easy to understand and suitable for all ages
5,Cracker-lack'in Good!,"This sequel was one of the funniest, unlike most movies that should have stopped at part 2. Keeping the original character voices makes it even better, especially with such an awesome cast!"
4,The serial,"good movie, the serial to the rest of the Madagascar movies!! I liked it and IF need be I would buy it again just to watch all the movies in sequence!! LOL"
5,Madagascar nails it again,Great and fun for all! The whole family l o v e d It. M a d a g a s c ar 3. Is a hit.
4,Afro Circus,"How can you beat the Afro Circus edition with a free rainbow colored Afro bundled with the product?? The movie is just as good as the 2 previous versions. If you liked Madagascar 1 & 2, you will like 3 as well."
3,not that funny,"funny overal and ok movie, but the plot felt forced and it wasn,t that funny. you know a movie isn't that funny when the funniest line in the previews. and then that line is repeated at least 2 more times in the movie. if you are a fan of the series then watch it at least once."
2,Boring at times...,Madagascar 3 was a little boring for me. I almost felt sleeping while my daughter enjoyed it. Madagascar 2 was much better.
5,Funny!,"Great movie! So funny! Best Madagascar movie so far. It was funny, had a good story line and was entertaining with several good one-liners. Good for kids to watch."
2,Wouldn't buy this one again,"I bought this mixer about 3 years ago. I bake/cook frequently so it was used at least once per week over that time. I had no complaints about it, and thought it worked quite well, until this December. I was making cookies for Christmas, and it started to smell ""hot"" then suddenly quit working. The dough was not anything challenging, it was sugar cookie dough. It no longer works and now I am in the market for a new mixer. It won't be a West Bend."
1,It's Not Worth It,"The sixth & final volume,thank God,(no pun intended) of a six volume series. See series review on the Reality Dysfunction: Emergence page."
1,Rip Off!,If you buy all the albums seperate it would not cost 400 dollars! This box set has no extra tracks or anything of value for that matter. Avoid!
5,A definitive history that must be in every library!,"If there is one book that should be required for every high school student studying american history, this is it. Given the numerous letters Adams had written to all the important (and unimportant) figures of the american revolution, McCullough had plenty of material to guide his pen. Not only is this a book about John Adams, it also provides insight into the voices and actions of the other founding fathers, particularly Jefferson (and Franklin). In fact, assuming you don't already know the dynamics of Jefferson's character, you may walk away from this book with a different opinion of him. Given all that has happened in the past year, this is a great book to explore the origins of american political thought. A good read that is a must for every library, american or not."
5,Should Be Required Reading,What can I say. This was one of those life changing books for me. The lessons that I learned really made me appreciate my american heritage and realize how fragile our democracy is. As flawed as Mr. Adams was you can't deny that he was an intragrul part of what made this country great. (and his wife Abigail too by the way)
5,Depth and Breadth,"This is simply one of the best biographies I have ever read. It goes into great detail in a refreshing style in four important periods of Adams' life: The Continental Congress up through 1776; the residency abroad as United States minister to England and Holland; the Presidency; and the retirement.In all of the periods important relationships are traced, especially those with Jefferson, Abigail Adams, and sons John Quincy and Charles, allowing the reader to see evolutions of these relationships rather than a static description of them.Finally, the scholarship is impeccable. A true delight to read."
1,Something lacking,"I don't know exactly what it is--but this bio of Adams is missing something key to his personality. For my money, the old two volume bio of Adams by Page Smith that I read last summer after visiting Adams house is the real, solid definitive bio. This is artful and clever--the Page Smith books are the real thing."
3,interesting book,"Intersting and insightful book, if not a little slow, about John Adams and the other founders of the United States of America. It is worth the read for people who care about this country and are interested in its history."
5,A New Friendship,"Reading the first few pages of this book is like starting a new friendship. McCullough brings John and Abigail Adams to life. Closing the book for the final time felt like I had lost a dear friend. The story is gripping, entertaining, fascinating, and moving. You will come to know Mr. Adams as a person. By knowing him as a person you will realize how great his impact was."
4,Did not suffer fools gladly.....,"Having nothing beyond an elementary knowledge of our Founding Fathers, this book has caused me to load up my Wish-List with more biographies from the era. Biographies, particularly of past eras, seem to be divided into the mind-numbingly boring and those that flow so well that you are sorry for it to end. This is one of the latter.The more I read about our history, the more I see that it is very difficult to impossible to place current events in the proper perspective without a knowledge of what proceeded them. It seems to have opinions on political matters without having a grasp of this is, to a degree, to pull a random idea out of the air and hope for the best.A great story about a great man that will help you better understand the origins and ideas of the men who framed American life as we know it."
4,The author and the subject both deserve our respect,"David McCullough has written a fascinating book. Although taken aback by its size (it's more than 2 inches thick), I quickly became immersed in the story of a man who dedicated his life to the establishment of an independent nation. My first exposure to John Adams was in the musical film ""1776,"" which portrayed him as crotchety, arrogant and not nearly as important as Thomas Jefferson or Benjamin Franklin, with whom he shared so much of history. Similarly, in ""Jefferson"" by Max Byrd, Adams is made to seem somewhat cranky and fairly unimportant. Not so in this book. Unlike other biographers, McCullough neither creates a fictionalized version of history nor writes a boring litany of dates, places and events; instead, he lets Adams and his wife, Abigail, speak for themselves through their letters, interspersed with information provided for context. I have gained a new respect for John Adams and now add David McCullough to my list of admired writers."
2,Biographers Should keep their distance,"I usually like McCullough's work, but am disappointed in this one. McCullough seems to have become infatuated with Adams, therefore he highlights his good points (admittedly there are many) and so minimizes his errors that the result is historical distortion and misrepresentation.McCullough completely fails his job as biographer in minimizing the dangerous Alien and Sedition Acts. Adams signed this anti-democratic tyrannical bills and must be held accountable. McCullough sloughs them off as though they are piffle. Clearly, he is not thinking as clearly as he usually does."
3,readable life -- leaves some questions unanswered,"David McCullough's John Adams is a very readable life and provides, I think, a good introduction to the man and his thought. Readers, however, should be warned that the book leaves some nagging questions unanswered ranging from trivial to rather significant. The question of what folks meant exactly by John Adam's ""vanity"" is one, why John Adams was so solidly the number two candidate for first President of the United States is another. After all, he had been in Europe for most of the Confederation, who was doing his politicking for him? Did politicking need to be done? How was his image shaped in the public's mind during his absence?The index and bibliography are good. There are no comments in the endnotes. The real reading length is thus 634 pages."
2,Touched My Heart,"The lyrics are exceptional! Randy's songs are powerful, joyful and fun! I keep the CD in my car so that I can listen to it regularly. While listening, I am reminded of a love and power that exceeds all the little worries of my day. This is a CD that keeps on giving! Every time I listen, I find a new treasure!"
1,This book was a dissappointment for me.....,"Unless already know the name of the maker, it's fairly difficult to look up a unknown, cryptic mark. I have to thumb through the whole book to find the mark I'm searching for. There is no cross reference section.The book is organized and alphabetized by maker.Unfortunately, there's very little information about the maker him/herself. Just circa and location. That's it. If I wanted to know more about a specific maker, I would have to refer to the bibliography section and buy another book.I expected much more from Kovels."
2,what does it truly do? i cannot say,"castor cream has done nothing for my small flat moles. it seems somewhat exfoliative but otherwise does not work after 4 weeks of use. very unimpressed, but maybe it'll do somethin' for you?"
5,Here the complete and correct track listing....,"The truely great Shirley Bassey! You won't go wrong with this one.This CD is a Digitally Remastered Masterpiece. CD Contains 26 tracks:01 With These Hands02 As Long As He Needs Me03 You'll Never Know04 Climb Every Mountain05 Reach For The Stars06 I'll Get By(As Long As I Have You)07 Tonight08 Ave Maria09 Far Away10 What Now My Love11 I(Who Have Nothing)12 My Special Dream13 Gone14 Goldfinger15 No Regrets16 It's Yourself17 The Liquidator18 Big Spender19 This Is My Life(La Vita)20 Something21 (Where Do I Begin)Love Story22 For All We Know23 Diamonds Are Forever24 Never, Never, Never(Grande, Grande, Grande)25 Moonraker26 Goldfinger"
5,One Ship= Many Lives=One Great Read,"When I was a child I loved being taken to the piers in New York City to see the magnificent ocean liners when they were in port, so perhaps I was predisposed to like this book, and like it I did! From the moving encounter of her launch, through the details of the interior, her art work, to her exciting yet mournful end this book is a great read. Even her possibly boring facts and statistics are presented in a very readable manner. The cover begs to become a coffee table accessory, but open it; this is a book for everyone to enjoy!"
4,Like butter on a bald monkey,"My mom showed me these videos when I was home on break from school, and I wasn't really expecting to like them since I have never seen any comtemporary Christian videos for kids that weren't hideously cheesy.However, Larry and Bob are another story. This cartoon series has the rare ability to entertain all ages; in fact, there are some bits of humor that I doubt an 8-year-old would get (""Definitely time for Wapner"").So when I got back to school and found the Silly Songs video, I must admit I bought it... and watched it... and made all my roommates watch it too. And now scarcely a day goes by when I don't find myself singing ""Miren al pepino..."" under my breath."
5,Great Family Entertainment!,"My kids, ages 5, 10, and 18, all love the Veggie Tales movies! The tunes are so catchy, you find yourself humming them! And the moral messages these videos give are great - we need more family entertainment like this!"
5,Can you imagine singing songs that vegetables sing?,"I know. I didn't think it was possible either, but after watching this video a time or two, you too will be singing these silly songs from the Veggie Tales videos.Some of these songs contain Christian messages, others are just plain silly. Some are from the other VeggieTales videos; one of them is new (The Pirates Who Won't Do Anything). This first of the song videos from VeggieTales combines the best of the music from all of their early videos and is great fun."
3,Part ego but fascinating,"Reading this is like watching a murder in slow motion You don't want to watch but can't stop. There is a lot of ego from the author than doesn't add to the story but the details can be riveting, especially the story of the Tsar which is a page turner. There is too much scientific detail and too little description but overall interesting book . I felt the author liked to toot his own horn which is why I gave three stars but I still recommend this as worth reading."
2,A disappointment,"I have read many books regarding forensic anthropology. Mr. Maples is eminently qualified as an anthropologist but I found his book to be lacking. His refusal to identify specific places, dates and identifications causes me to wonder how much is fact and how much is fiction. Dangling cases that go nowhere are a waste of time. So a bone was found by the side of the road and a dog chewed on it and??????? Where's the story there?"
1,Worst Movie ever,"This has to be the worst movie i ever saw, poorly acted ,horrible music ,and poor plot and character development.!!! a giant snooze fest."
4,Funky,"I bought this to use with my laptop in tight quarters. Works fine, and the changing colors add a little spice!"
5,"Low budget, but high entertainment!","I really enjoyed this movie. The girls were hot. The story was interesting. The students of a college class puts together ""Jigsaw,"" a mannequin that comes to life, and hacks them up to pieces. This isn't Shakespear. It's better!"
2,A Bit Disappointed,"As a lover of horror movies, I purchased this movie expecting more and expecting gore. Although some scenes were cool, overall this movie was boring at times and there was poor acting. College students are asked to put together a mannequin which they called Jigsaw. After burning Jigsaw, he comes to life and starts killing them off one by one. A few good killing scenes but overall, a disappointing movie. Rent it, don't buy it!"
4,"Good book, but check the errata","I like this book. I made my own version of the hourglass sweater (plain stockinette was too boring, I did a k1, sl1 round every 8 rounds or so to give the mohair-silk blend I used a little more texture and to play up subtle color variations in the yarn) and I've given this book as a gift. Do check the errata at purlsoho.com though! Lots of the patterns had errors which an experienced knitter can probably easily self-correct, but newer knitters will definitely be stumped by. I've heard later editions may be corrected, but better safe than sorry, right?"
2,lots of mistakes,"I was disappointed with this book. The projects were well presented and I love the color, but every time I made something I ran in to misprints, or omissions in the patterns. This was frustrating. I finally found a link online and 3 pages of corrections. In my opinion if you have that many mistakes you should send it out to all the shops who have your book and let the buyers know - the book should come with the correction pages. The book had been out for a while before I purchased it and they later made a newer version - so I feel like I'm the sucker who got stuck with a version that should have been recalled."
2,Beautiful and frustrating book,I started two projects in this book after not knitting in many years. Both resulted in a lot of ripping out due to poor instructions and pictures that did not match what the instruction said. The website no longer has corrections so I am left to figure things out on my own and as others have said when you have purchased high priced yarn you want to make it perfect.I do not recommend this book- go to the library.
3,Pattern Errors,"As a new parent,, the title of this book was very enticing. I wanted to be able to continue to gift knit for friends, especially those having babies. As a ""confident beginner"" knitter, I was frustrated by the language in the patterns. More details are needed. There are excessive math errors (ie: leg warmers, child's placket pullover, men's cashmere scarf, silk camisole, hourglass sweater, and herringbone poncho patterns) throughout the book. I was given pattern corrections when I visited the author's NYC Soho knit shop, Purl, in November. Since then more revisions have been made as of January 2005. Save yourself time and frustration by going to www.purlsoho.com for book corrections. On second thought, you might want to wait and purchase this book if and when a second edition is published. Another FYI: Mission Falls 1824 Cotton used in the ""children's cotton hat"" has been discontinued. This yarn was the charm of this pattern."
5,I want some more!,A really great film - the definitive Oliver Twist. Polanski and his team bring the original Dickens text to life. Recommended.
5,wonderful,Daughter is a high school teacher. She wanted this movie to add to her collection to share with her kids.
4,Good book -- but there's one even better,"This is a well-written, well-researched, long-overdue biography of an important figure in advertising and American life.A glaring omission, however, is the lack of any mention of or reference to Joe Vitale's pioneering book on Barton's methods: The Seven Lost Secrets of Success.For anyone who wants to know the principles by which Barton accomplished what he did--and how they can put Barton's methods to work in their own business or career--Vitale's Seven Lost Secrets of Success is the book to get."
5,Excellently done!!,This video is great!! I'm an 18 year old college student and I loved watching it with my little brothers and sisters. Great message too. Silly Songs with Larry is great as usual. A great flick.
3,The Philadelphia Experiment creatively re-imagined.,"James F. David reimagines the Philadelphia Experiment from 1943 in this modern retelling that presents the 'what if' premise whereby the USS Norfolk is actually existing in some sort of limbo (referred to here as Pot Of Gold).To make matters worse, the USS Nimitz, a super war-ship armed with a handful of nuclear weapons is lost within a cloud of green mist and sent to the very same Pot of Gold. A team of psychic, dream researchers band together with members of the US Military Intelligence community to travel to this Pot Of Gold region --- and what they find is way beyond what they could have imagined.A bit slow at times, but an incredibly imaginative concept that I cannot believe has not had a Hollywood script treatment done on it."
5,SmartMouth Dry Mouth Relief Mints,"I love this product. I have severe problems with dry mouth. These mints have helped me tremendously. The packaging is very handy, it is a low calorie product (and no sugar) and I can use them whenever. I always have a pack with me. I am also delighted that I can buy them in quantity. And they taste good without being too strong. Marian"
2,Expensive breath mints,These mints works the same as other mints but cost a lot more. It does not really last long in mouth either
1,what went wrong?,"as soon as i read all the previews stating that they were out to make something bigger and more lasting than other cds, i knew it was trouble. and rather than the fun beats of the past we get this drivel. guest spot by bernard sumner...what more do you need to know.if you are expecting anything like planet dust or dig your own hole, forget it. this is lightweight boring trash."
1,1 star is way too high a rating,My mother's washing machine and dryer make the same sounds. Turn on the buzzing laundry room overhead light and the snapping and popping of Uncle Paul's insect zapper and BABY WE GOT A DEAD CERT!! Their music is pure dreck!
3,don't always believe the hype,unfortunatly seemed a bit dissapointing after the fantastic 'dig your own hole'. just gets a bit *to* psychadelic in places for me.
2,Unremarkable and occasionally tedious,"I bought this CD at the same time as Play by Moby and Beaucoup Fish by Underworld. Unfortunately I had to keep reminding myself to listen to it, just to make sure I wasn't missing anything. All in all, I found the whole CD pretty boring. The first two tracks are kind of catchy, but nothing that will stick in your mind and drive you to pop the CD in your stereo as soon as you think of it."
5,album of the year,"Strange and different? Nevermind. This a rock coup. This album has it's own rhythms and it's own space. You can't help but dance along. It's close-minded to say that they've abandoned ""big beat,"" they've just moved onto different sounds. And made a more complete album to boot. With a healthy dose of housy-housy gay clubdom, a wollop of what Madchester always tried to be, a smidge o' Kraftwerk, and their own original style (a band that can fake-sample their own first two albums?) they blow it all out on this one. Turn it up and boogie. This is what twentieth-century rock music has been about, and what twenty-first music should be."
1,Yet another over-hyped disappointment.,"Surrender confirms again the weakness of many of the current electronic/sample acts :- too much studio time and too few ideas. Here technology has been used to cover up the total lack of any real musical hook or theme. OK, there are a couple of decent offerings here, but as usual, the main input on these tracks has been from others, (Sumner, Gallagher etc). The Chem's should go back to what they are really good at i.e remixing the best tracks created by other more musically astute artists."
3,decent,"I think this cd is decent but it does not touch Dig Your Own Hole or Exit Planet Dust. Every other album that they put out was amazing I mean trully amazing. Even their mix album was amazing. But this album is nothing special, I do like a few songs on it though. Don't get me wrong they are both increadible DJs but their other stuff is much better. I dig the cd and Im glad I got it but dont expect the best cd in the world."
1,A great disappointment,"Anticipation for this albumn was great... popped it in the player and said WHAT! where's the good stuff... this whole albumn put me to sleep... no beats but the 4/4... too many vocals and no BUG-OUT --- the only song that comes close to makin' you groove is ""under the influence"" which will probably be the only song i will ever listen to again from this disc. Do your self a favor - save the $15 bucks and listen to their old stuff... it kicks the crap out of this!"
2,"Interesting ideas, boring music.","I can respect what the boys were trying to accomplish with this album, but they just don't quite make it there. The strong consistency of Exit Planet Dust was their finest point, and they lose a little bit with each consecutive release. Oh well."
2,Major Dissapointment,"I am a big Chem Bros fan and was looking forward to this release for weeks. I like their big beats and incorporation of new sounds and voices. I was dissapointed because this album is a lot lighter than previous. There were three songs I liked, Tracks 2,3,9, but the rest all sounded the same to me. They just didn't sound like the hard hitting Chem Bros of old. I will just have to keep on listening to old school Chems."
1,wrong aspect ratio,was so happy when i received this set.but my heart sunk when i put it on and noticed straight away its in the wrong scope.the is a amazing series was made in 4:3 ratio but on these discs its forced into 16:9.everything looks very distorted.you might be lucky and your tv or dvd player can switch to 4:3 and let you watch it as was originally intended.not mine dou.looks like im going to have to fork out for the original set put out buy bci.
4,"A good game, but not the best I 've seen","Basicly a mix of civ2, alpha centauri and some goodies. It has taken most of the good civ2 stuff, taken most of the bad stuff out, and put in usualy good features and some times bad features to make a pretty good game. The tricky at first, easy after practice way of moving units might stop some people from picking up this game, but I recommend you get it."
2,Civ II in a new box.,"Why didn't I just read the packaging and put it down. No, I had to go and buy it. I played Civ II once, Alpha Centauri two or three times, and now Call to Power... well, I didn't make it through the tutorial.One word... ZZZZZZZZZZZ!"
5,"Stop on a dime! Great Pads, they last too.","This is my third set of PF Carbon Metallics, the first having gone on my S-10, now I am on my second set in my Tacoma.The do make a difference, or at least I think so."
2,"I wanted to like this book, but it just didn't work","Anneke was not believable as a computer consultant. She was not likable, coming off as a very self-obsessed, shallow clotheshorse. The author's writing technique got very much in the way of the telling of the story. The rules of fair play in handling a mystery were not, in my opinion, followed. Things were very deus ex machina. I was not satisfied with how the mystery was solved."
1,One star because thats the lowest rating,"Bought this as a Christmas present. First one was defective. Amazon replaced it., no questions. (wouldn't recharge) Second one seemed to work, the recharge light would come on and the volt meter would show it recharged. This isn't something you use everyday so it got put away and when we went camping and tried to air up float tubes it wouldn't recharge. Don't know if wagon will make it right."
1,not use full,"well i thought this would help but it will not hold a charge and it dies after about 2 min ,....... tried to use the air compresser to blow up an airmatresss but it didnt work ,..... cant be retunred i would not recomend unless you wanna waste money"
4,400 Watt Power Dome,I think this is a good product. It gives you an emergency power source and air. I used it the other day to jump a car and it worked well.
2,"Jump start yes, AC power source no","The Wagan power dome's light weight and relative small size (car battery size) is good for an emergency jump starter and tire inflation, but it doesn't serve well as an emergency power source. I hoped it could run a 1/4 hp sump pump during power failures, but it doesn't have the energy output."
3,"Adaquate, but does have shortcomings...","Most everything works as expected, except the air pump (which is what I use it for the most). After a short time of owning this unit the air compressor started doing some funny things and , now, only works intermittently and for short durations, not over a minute. I have a Stanley 500 amp unit that works like a charm with it's air compressor, but it has shortcomings to, such as how to charge it and no inverter like the Wagan. Everything else works adaquately, but it would be nice that the air compressor did, as well. I am taking off 2 stars for that and the length of time you have to charge the unit (34 hours) and for it's bulk (weighs about 20 lbs). I live on a farm, so it is indispensible, but it not perfect, by any means."
4,Pretty solid purchse,"I thought that the Wagan 400 Watt Power Dome Jump Starter was pretty solid, although I was disappointed that the USB outlet wouldn't power or charge an ipod. It would only power something much smaller. Other than that, I don't have any complaints. I haven't used the actual jumper cables yet but the air compressor seemed to do a good job on my boat trailer."
3,Old film that is easy to follow,"This film is an old film, dubbed with English. Unfortunately, it doesn't contain as much of the music of the opera as I had expected, but what is included is very good."
4,Billie Piper,"I'm not big of a Billie fan, but I find this song okay. I think it's totally different from her previous singles. She's more mature now. If Day and Night wont do well in the US, nothing will."
2,Not Great,Two of the three components (locks) would not work in my applocation. The hitch receiver Lock was too short and the hitch losk (for trailer hich lock lever) was also too short. Could not use two out of three components.
5,an important book,"This book is as much for families of those with cancer as it is for those with cancer.First read an excerpt in Yankee Magazine in the spring. ""Songs"" delivers on that promise.Despite the subject matter, the book is funnier than you would think."
4,It was good but not as good as the first two.,"Have you ever played the Playstation game Tomb Raider before? Well, Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul is related to it. How? I'll tell you this much. Tomb Raider I was better than all the other Tomb Raider games, except it had worse graphics and less things that Lara can do. Well, Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul I & II were better than the third. But it was a really good book, you should read it anyways."
2,"good product, bad packaging",The tone is great but I found there were cracks at the bottom of the bottle and the bottle leaks.
4,Face Cleanser,I use this to clean my face with a cotton ball. It is supposed to be stronger than the other commercial types of witch hazel. I'm happy with it.
2,DONT BUY IT !!!!!,"OK, NOT THE BEST BOOK. IT GETS KINDA BORING AFTER A WHILE AND I THINK THE ENDING IS REALLY SORT OF CHILDISH. BUT YOU WILL LIKE IT IF YOU LIKE THE BABY SITTERS BOOKS. ITS GOOD TO PASS TIME WITH OR TO TAKE A BREAK WITH IF YOU ARE READING A BIGGER BOOK."
1,You get what you pay for,"Opened the cover after installing the unit and the cheap plastic pins broke where it hinges. Never got to use it. Disgruntled I went and looked at a more expensive cover and guess what..it was identical to the Boss with plastic pins. Not sure if it was made from a more durable plastic, but be very careful when looking at these."
3,A good movie that is just slightly off,"I enjoyed this movie just as I enjoy most of the Veggie Tales movies. The music is entertaining and there is a good message. I just think that the message and the retelling of the story in this one is just not as good as some of the other ones. Your kids will be entertained though and as usual, this is a quality piece of work that Big Idea has put together. On the plus side, it contains my favorite silly song ""The Dance of the Cucumber""! In addition, the DVD has some fun things you can do like change the voices on certain scences and a narrative from the founders."
1,This is not a video I would have in my collection,"It contains a song (The Bunny Song) that encourages disobedience, and wrong thinking.The song has new words in the Silly Sing Along 2 video but have not been changed in the video Rack Shack and Benny. I am not sure why."
5,Great mini planner,"I have used ME's calendar planners for years. I like this version the best. ME's desk planner's pages are glossy, so any entries made in pen would smear when you closed the book. This purse calendar has more paper-like pages, so you can write and not worry about the ink rubbing off on other days. I also love the handy cardboard sleeve to keep it in---keeps the pages from dog-earring. Great price, sturdy, and super cute art inside each month!"
5,I love this album. One of the best of 1998.,"Like most Sepultura fans, I wasn't sure if the Sepultura could hold its own without Max Cavalera. But Against proves that Sepultura's success has been more than just one man's effort and that Max wasn't the only talented member of this group. New vocalist Derrick Green fits like a glove, sounding enough like Max that the music is still Sepultura, yet sounding different enough as not to sound like a total Max clone. You can certainly tell he'll do a great job with past Sepultura material on tour.Though I would still rank this a hair below the Soulfly CD (which is awesome), this is a tremendous effort by Sepultura. The departure of Max might have been a blessing in disguise for Sepultura fans (not to mention RoadRunner Records). Now every couple of years we can look forward to both a great Soulfly and Sepultura album. If you like Sepultura (or innovative metal in general), you owe it to yourself to check out Against."
3,A new SEPULTURA,"I have to admit,it takes awhile to get used to this album, if you are a fan of the band. Yes Max is gone and doing well with his new band, but make no mistake, SEPULTURA is still alive and kicking. AGAINST is a pretty good album, not as great as the ones before it, but it shows that the future is still bright for the band. Andreas still plays some killer riffs on the album, and Igor is still one of the best drummers in music today with the beats and rhythms he lies down on the songs. Derrick Green has a great voice for metal music. He can growl and holler with the best of them, but can also sing melodies when called for. the music is still there, but some of the lyrics so unfinished. Of course with a new singer, they have to find their niche, but I think that SEPULTURA will be great again once they become confortable with Derrick. AGAINST, CHOKE OLD EARTH, BOYCOTT are good songs to listen to. Also give the instrumentals TRIBUS and KAMAITACHI a listen they are killer also."
2,Please apply Max factor,"After the sad demise of 'Roots'-era Sepultura we are left with Soulfy and a new Seps lineup. Whilst Max's offering was a little too formulaic for some, relying on tried and tested song structures, the new-look Seps disappoint for another reason. The unique brand of guttural heaviness boasted by 'Roots' has gone. This is, it pains me to say it, run-of-the-mill metalcore. Mind you, 'Hatred Aside' and the title track aren't bad... But 2 medicore albums later there's going to be a few people a bit narked at the reality of never being able to hear anything new from classic Sepultura again."
2,SEPULTURA RULED... !,"Sepultura ruled, but after MAx Cavalera left the band, nothing was the same anymore. But I think this CD is a transition, and the band will continue strong as ever, playing with heart and sincerity."
5,Fun For the Whole Family,My fiance and I played this against my 16 yr old daughter and her boyfriend. We had a ball even if we did lose at the very end! This game is fun for ages 8 to adult!
2,Runs too easily,"I have the same problem some others have mentioned. These socks run way too easily. Believe it or not, my regular knee-high nylons are more durable that these socks have been. I had gold toe trouser socks in the past and specifically sought these out to replace my last bunch. Guess I'll be looking around for a different new brand, these were definitely not worth the money."
4,Layer upon layer.,"This record is an onion of the most satisfying sounds I've heard outside of R.E.M. My sole complaint is it is too long. Crop off fifteen minutes and the result would be a trim, lean c.d."
2,questionable,"The seems on this are weak I have purchased two each have had problems.KwikTek T-Top PFD storage bag, holds up to 6 PFDs"
1,Works poorly,I returned this product because it did not hook up properly to the hardtop on my boat. It hung down too low and got in the way so I sent it back.
4,Worth the money,"This is the second one I bought for my t-top since I have room for two. I have used the first one for two seasons and have not had any problems. It is not the best product in the world and not the worst, but it is definitely worth the money compared to others on the market. Make sure your T-Top has a bar that will run down the middle of the bag so that you can attach the middle support strap to that bar. Otherwise, the bag will sag and get in your way (i.e it will hit your head when standing ect). The directions for installation are not the best but it is easy enough to figure out."
3,An Average Book,"This was just an average book to get. The stuff Mike Morrison explains expects you to have a scanner, and adobe photostyler. It is really a pain in the neck. (Or, you could go out and buy photo CD's...) Unless you just want to know MORE about Image processing, but don't wish to learn HOW, then, this book MIGHT be for you."
1,Don't Collaborate,"This book was forced upon many Archdiocese Of Baltimore teachers for a course forced upon them. Being a teacher for many years this book lives by the motto, ""nothing new under the sun."" Dull, redundent, and any other euphanism that suggests awful would be appropos."
5,"Distressing, but beautiful","This is a writer who seems to care more than anything about how his sentences come together. I am glad, because if it were not for the sheer beauty of the prose, this novel would be terrifying. I do not think I have encountered a story this brutal and relentless in years. An important book, I think."
4,Cornelius: One Step Back for Mankind,"So, there was this band called Flipper's Guitar. Oyamada Keigo and Ozawa Kenji rocked under the Double Knockout Corporation and put out some extremely great pop music. ""Doctor Head's World Tower"" is a psychadelic-90's-pop masterpiece. Then FLipper's broke up and Oyamada became Cornelius. His first effort went back to the vibe of Flipper's middle period album, ""Camera Talk"". Golden pop melodies with a full-orchestra feel (""Those horn parts!""). There is a little acid jazz-UFO-kind of feel on one track, but generally the album is full out pop with no samples attached. ""69/96"" took him more into the rock direction and ""Fantasma"" took him into the epic masterpiece direction. Before you buy ""First Question Award"", definately know that it sounds nothing like ""Fantasma"". But hey, that's half the charm."
4,KB sig,"Definitely a Ken Burn signature story telling technique. I prefer the use of actual photographs, video reels and interviews to provide authenticity to a Historical event narrative. Others have used actors for re-enactment, which makes it mellowdramatic, fake and ""hard to swallow."". The way Ken Burn does it leave you to your own imagination of how it was at the time. An honest truth. i wouldn't mind if his next project is ...""the boat people"""
5,Amazing,Everyone should have this DVD in their library of DVDs! It's an amazing look back into our history. Makes me super thankful that I didn't personally experience that time.
2,Where are the other 2 books?,"The title of Agrippa's work is ""Three Books of Occult Philosophy"". That is what I thought I was buying. Guess what...this is only Volume 1. Nowhere in the order description did it say this was only volume 1. It said ""Three Books"".Llewellens looks like a complete triad for only $10 more. Don't waste your time with the Cosimo version"
4,"And Yes, Older Kids Love It Too!","I'm 12 years old and in 6th grade. The other day, my religion teacher brought in this Veggie Tales video for us to watch. I must say, I loved it. It was funny and cute but full of teaching, too, on how we should always do what God says, even if it seems crazy at the time. My class loved it so much that we all coaxed my teacher into watching it again the next day. And, no one could get that 'Silly Songs with Larry' song out of their head, either. I highly recommend it. Cebu..."
5,BEST HAIRDRYER EVER!!!!!,My sister let me borrow this same hairdryer and the next day I immediately went online and had one rushed to my house. I simply could not live without this product!!
2,wanted to like it,I really wanted to like this but it just does not work for my hair. It was awkward to hold and use and did not make my hair smooth at all. My hair was straight but very frizzy. My old conair 1874 dryer with attached brush worked much better than this and is half the price.
3,Not for fine hair,"I have curly shoulder length fine hair. I use this dryer with the concentrator end, not the straightner, to dry my hair quickly. It turns out soft and mostly straight. If I use the high heat, it is a wild mess. I still haven't gotten the hang of the other attachment. I still have to use a round brush, but this dryer is much faster. Def. use the cool button when done for smoothness."
4,Nice hair dryer,"My hair is dry much faster with this model. It also comes out straighter with less work than using a brush. Sometimes I use a brush with the dryer and hold the hair down over the ionic rollers. It took a few times to get used to how to hold the dryer and where to position the head. I still need to use the iron as well but not as much as with my old dryer. FYI - I have very thick, coarse, shoulder length hair and I can dry my hair straight in about 20 minutes. I think it is worth the money."
2,Cant recommend this thing,"The only nice quality of this product is its color. Believe me. It does not straighten your hair as it claims, it just dries it. Plus, it is really, really heavy.Really, dont buy it. I wish someone had told me before buying this thing."
3,"The drier is ok, but there are a few problems with it.","I've never been able to straighten my hair with a blow drier alone. It's gets really fuzzy and puffy. Flat ironing it after helps considerably, but if I let my hair dry in a pony tail or braid before using the flat iron instead the end result is much better. I thought this blow dryer would give me a better result than others I have tried.The attachment was easier to use than drying with a brush but that's about all I can say for it. The results were no different.What really annoyed me about this dryer however, is that I can't find a diffuser to fit it. I think it's safe to assume most people buying this product will have curly hair and would therefore need one, so I consider this to be a huge oversight."
1,don't waste your money.,"A hair dryer with a round comb will do the work safer. I tryed this hair dryer and could not even finish because it just broke soooooo much of my hair, I could not belive. I returned at the same day."
3,Conair Hair Designer,I'm still learning to use this product. It would have been nice to have a video to see how it works. The seller was great. Product arrived as schedules in great condition. I would buy from this seller again.
1,DOES NOT WORK,"The blowdryer works fine, but the straightener did not work at all for my hair. I have shoulder length hair, soft texture, spiral curls. This product did not work at all for me, but I think if a person only had wavy hair, or only slight curls it MIGHT work...all I know for sure is that it did not work on my hair...I ended up looking like David Lee Roth did in the 80s. Not what I was going for!"
1,OUCH! Please Be Careful,"The straightening attachment gets VERY VERY hot and falls offtoo easily. I was drying my hair and the attachmentfell off onto my lap (I was in my towel) and burned my legs.I cannot believe Conair would allow such a design flaw. It isone thing if this hair dryer doesn't straighten hair (I agreewith the other reviewers, the attachment doesnt seem to ""grip""your hair enough to actually do anything. You might as wellbe using a clothes iron) but it's an entirely different storywhen the product is dangerous to use. =0"
1,No good.,This did not do like they show you on the info on T.V.It was just a hair dryer with attachments to me. Don't waste your money on it. It did not straighten my hair AT all. Thank goodness I got a refund. G.S. Okla.
1,Horrible,"Horrible, terrible, can't hold it properly to dry hair. Don't buy it!!!!! Tried it a few times. Have thick hair. Wasn't able to maneuver itin my hand to dry hair."
5,Wanda Jackson Collection,"Very deserving of her new appointment to the Rock N Roll Hall of flame. She is not the queen of rockabilly music for nothing, this is one of the best anthologies I've ever heard, also on of the funniest. Love live Wanda!Vintage Collections Series"
3,The End Was Near.....,"We go from the original band's strongest album to one of their weakest. I am not sure what the whole story is surrounding this disc. It was the last to feature the original Alice Cooper band before Alice split for a solo career. The band was breaking up and Bob Ezrin had fled the scene which makes ""Muscle"" an uneven although not bad disc. The album is not really a concept piece, but seems to revolve around the theme of New York City and sex. All of the songs seem to deal with these two subjects with the exception of the would be James Bond theme ""Man With The Golden Gun"". The album had a couple of minor hits with the title track and ""Teenage Lament 74"" both of which are ok songs, but nothing spectacular. The rest of the album is hard rock Alice with average music and average lyrics. This album is worth owning for the Cooper fan, but after the excellent ""Billion Dollar Babies"" the original band went out on a much lower note with this one."
3,"a pretty strong, straight forward alice cooper album","I think this album is underrated. it's about as consistantly good as most other ACG albums, yet people rarely talk about it. ""Muscle of love,"" ""Never ben sold before,"" and Teenage Lament '74 are as good as the coop gets. There are a couple throw aways, but as far as i'm concerned most AC albums have a couple. if you already have LOVE IT, KILLER, BABIES & SCHOOL'S OUT, and you're wondering what to get next, this should be it."
3,Alice Cooper - 'Muscle Of Love' (WEA),"As hard as it is to believe, I've run across several fans that simply don't remember this lp at all, plus a few not very well. 'Muscle Of Love' was the follow-up to their notorious 'Billion Dollar Babies' album. The seventh and final lp by the original Alice Cooper Group, before of course Alice went solo. I've always liked 'Muscle Of Love' for what it was. More straight ahead rock & roll, less glitter / shock like 'Billion Dollar Babies' or 'School's Out' was. Cuts I found to my liking were ""Big Apple Dreaming"", the title track ""Muscle Of Love"", the lp's single ""Teenage Lament '74"" and perhaps 'Muscle Of Love's reply to 'Billion Dollar Babie's ""Mary Ann"", the somewhat creepy, but well written ballad ""Hard Hearted Alice"". Did you also know the band actually did a three week tour in support of 'Muscle'? I've seen proof, a decent sounding bootleg. Not a bad find."
3,What Extra Tracks!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I won't go into any great detail about this album that you wouldn't have already read in these reviews - either positive or negetive - being a fan of the ORIGINAL Alice Cooper Group, who owns an original copy of this album plus the six albums before it (and the Greatest Hits) on vinyl L.P., but I'd just like to know - WHAT EXTRA TRACKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Middle Of The Road Alice.,"Not nearly good as the album would release right after this, ""Muscle Of Love"" is in my opinion a mish-mash of awesome songs, as well as some more mundane material."
3,Requires Special Staples,"This stapler has an ingenious design, and it is able to really ""Fire"" a staple through a stack of paper with very little force required from the operator. It is really an innovative design, and makes it effortless to staple large stacks of paper.Here is my gripe . . . it requires special staples. What are the chances I can convince the bureaucracy to carry these specialty staples? Even if I decide to start buying my own staples, what are the chances I can find them at a Walmart or Office Depot when I need them?If you are willing to take on the hassle of stocking the specific staples used by this machine, you are going to love it. If you are like me, you will probably use it till you run out of the staples than come with it, and then toss it."
1,Broke after very light use,"I bought this item last year from Amazon. It has had VERY LIGHT use in my home office. I've never tried to staple 65 sheets of paper, which is what it's rated for. More like 20 sheets maximum, and not very many times. It worked well about two-thirds of the time, until today, when it completely stopped working. This was a pricey item, a splurge, which I bought thinking it would last forever. Very disappointed."
5,The Greatest Wish,"Mrs. Steinhauser's Fifth Grade ClassRuby wants to go to college, not get married. Long ago, girls in China didn't get to go to school. Ruby wants to learn and she thinks it isn't fair that only boys get to go. Ruby gets homeschooled because her grandfather is rich.This is a great story about the author, Shirin Yim Bridges' grandmother!"
4,The Grea Wish,"Mr. Llopis' Fifth Grade ClassRuby's grandfather was rich. Ruby is kind and respectful. Ruby is lucky because she gets to be homeschooled. Other girls in China cook and take care of the house, they can't go to school. Most girls in China don't get to do what the boys do. Ruby's wish is to go to college."
3,"If you can suspend belief, go ahead","Okay, but not a better Grisham. You have to be very willing to suspend belief to enjoy this story, because so much happens for the sheer purpose of supporting the author's intent, and for absolutely no other reason. In the end, it was very unsatisfying."
3,Grisham's The Partner gets my Brain Candy Analogy,"Empty calories, gets you excited for a little while and thenthe sugar wears off. Now, regret sinks in and you wish you'd had aV-8 instead."
4,"Like reading ""then what happened?"" after THE FIRM, but.....","I love John Grisham.....he always provides such a satisfying escape from real life. His characters are interesting, even if we keep meeting the same ones over and over again in different permutations in each book. I was mostly engrossed throughout the book, but lost track of the ""bad guys""...there were so many! And, I kept expecting the guys from THE FIRM to show up. Please, Mr. Grisham, you didn't HAVE to give us such a lame ending...I saw it coming 75 pages from the end. Nonetheless, I'm ordering my copy of STREET LAWYER as soon as I finish sharing my sage thoughts herein. sbrannan"
2,A Big Letdown From the King of Fiction,"When I put down ""The Partner"" after completing it, Ibegan to wonder if Grisham had lost his magic after all these years. Ifthis book would have ended without the last two pages, it would have been much better. ""The Partner"" also did not hold my attention as well as ""The Firm"" did. In my opinion, Grisham should take a few years off, collect his thoughts, and then go back to writing."
3,"enjoyable, but not one of Grisham's best","Like all of Grisham's books, except The Chamber (which I had no trouble putting down), I had trouble doing anything except reading this one. Unfortunately, Grisham did little to build the suspense he so successfully did in previous novels, but the plot was strong enough to carry the novel without much suspense. Also, I thought Lanigan was ""too much in control"" -- nothing went seriously wrong and the crooks, after showing an amazing amount of tenacity over four years, suddenly seemed to have no energy left. The ending was a surprise (thanks for keeping something for the end, Mr Grisham!), but really failed to hang together with the rest of the plot. John C. Antweiler, II"
2,don't bother,"I read the other reviews and still don't understand what anyone liked about this book! A Grisham fan, I was very disappointed by this dismal effort. There was no real impetus to root for any character. The book is like a slow ride downhill. You can see the ending, and there is no thrill. I kept waiting for 'the good part'. A nice little twist at the end.....but it's too little, too late"
5,A must read for all lawyers and future lawyers,"In this book, John Grisham makes it back to the days of old,when he wrote ""A Time to Kill"" and ""The Firm"".""The Partner"" kept my eyes seeking out each page with zeal. Grisham captures much of the inner law firm communications, or lack thereof, and his description of money transfers and electronic wiring, show the reader that this happens every minute that the markets are open. This book will make each and every partner take notice and make sure that they have instilled appropriate procedures when it comes to money transfers and the people in the firm with the authority or the ""knowledge"" to do so. As a future lawyer, (December 1997), I highly recommend that each and every attorney (to-be) read this book."
1,disappointed...........bad ending,"This is one of the worst John Grisham's books and is the worst I've ever come across....Maybe it's because i don't like bad endings, but this is horribly unacceptable."
2,This book(?) was drivel.,"I don't know if it was a book, it seemed more like a pamphlet for cheesey writing. I'd rather read a bunch of cereal boxes! Grisham certainly has some avid fans, but if he keeps up this kind of trash, they won't last long..."
4,FINALLY!,"a grisham novel comparable to the firm and the pelican brief! i was almost ready to give up on grisham, but this one delivers what fans of his first 2 blockbusters (yes, i realize a time to kill came first, but it didn't become a bestseller until the firm paved the way) expect."
3,"Pleasant, thought provoking and a little mystery...",It's different but it's good. Gives you some insight 'behind the scenes' in a large law firm. Very interesting indeed.Can't say too much without 'spoiling' the plot line.
4,"One of Grisham's best, but....","This was a very entertaining read with great twists and turns. Some have called the story unbelievable, which it may be, but its Fiction so I had no problem with Patrick's many talents. This is definitly one of Grisham's best, but, as many have reported one here, the ending is terrible. You almost wish you had just left the last few pages to your imagination instead of being thrown into this terrible ending to a fabulous story."
3,Disappointing,"Having eagerly awaited the arrival of Mr Grisham's latest endeavor it was disappointing to have done so. From his earlier works we know the author has the talentto keep one's attention for hours. Of all his previous writings this falls to the bottom of his list, second only to ""Runaway Jury"" in its mediocrity. Mr Grisham seems tobe falling into the routine of grinding out books for the money rather than quality as this writer has seen all too many times in the past"
2,"Great Beginning, Lousy Ending","I read the first couple of chapters online, and was so hooked, I couldn't wait to get my hands on the book. Unfortunately, the best reading in the book was what I'd gotten for free. I stayed with it to the end, despite less-than-interesting plot wanderings, and absolutely hated the ending. After The Client, The Firm and The Pelican Brief, Grisham went on my ""Buy Whatever He Writes"" list. It takes a lot to get bumped from that, but after The Partner, he was dropped to the ""Lending Library Only"" list."
3,Probably his worst,"The book started off well with the scenes in South America, but the perfectly put together plan when Peter was hauled back to the US was too much too take.The glaring flaw in Peter's plans was obvious a third of the way through the book and so the ""surprise"" ending to me seemed predictable.I thought the Rainmaker was Grisham's best book, but after The Partner and The Street Lawyer, it seems he is running out of ideas and becoming more and more formulaic."
4,Detrimental to sleep!,"I just finished this book. Even I am not a Englsh native speaker. I felt the suspence and thrill as well. It took three days to read it through. For three days, I did nothing but reading this book. But the ending is somewhat disappointed. Anyway, it is great. I strongly recommend it!!!!"
4,Is Grisham loosing his touch?,"I have read all of the Grisham novels with the exception of the newest one. This one was a little disappointing. It lacked the tension and excitement of his other books. This was a decent read but it lacked much of the flair that The Firm and The Pelican Brief have. You know when you read a book and them go see the movie? The movie is never as good? This book was written like it was the screen play. Not that it was bad, I just hoped for a little more..."
2,What a letdown. . . !,"I started this book with fervor and hunger and ended with a ""toss out the window"" of the book and a vow to find a new author to follow. In his haste to complete this book John Grisham forgot that readers are not dummies and that we expect the author to be true to his characters and his audience. After reading this book, I've taken a long pause from Grisham. . ."
5,Grisham at his best.,"Some of Grisham's works really grab hold of you even months after reading. Unlike The Brethren, this is just such a book.Of course, Grisham here is writing of lawyers and thus has a good handle on the topic. Perhaps, though, the key is that he spent more time paying attention to character development than on plot. If so, Stephen King, in On Writing, would congratulate his attention to character development.I strongly recommend this book."
3,Chelsea's Thoughts . . .,"Unlike Grisham's other novels, this one had weaknesses leaving the reader with too many unanswered questions. The biggest of these questions had to do with a basic premise of the book: Why did she wait until the end of the story to do what she did?"
2,2 Clever,"Great entertainment for the first three quarters; then Patrick's ""failure proof"" planning begins to get annoying-something should go wrong here and there. The international banking, spycraft, the legal maneuvers, etc. are wild and exciting-I don't know if it's ""authentic"", but Grisham makes it read wonderfully. The ending is strictly amateur night. It's like someone said, ""we need a twist here"" and the author tacked one on-it pretty much ruined the reading experience for me."
3,New Grisham book below expectations,"Don't get me wrong its a good book but having read his previous works (The Firm being my favorite), his newest release, The Partner, became too typical of his previous books. Everything just fit in too perfectly and made it unrealistic, and the ending was a surprise but not disappointing."
3,"""Cookie Cutter"" Characters But Good Story Line","We've seen these characters before in just about every other Grisham/Cornwell/Crighton type novel. However this book is set apart by the fact that we have no idea where this story is going to end up, and that is a good thing. I really enjoyed the novel, and enjoyed being surprised. The ending is rather ironic, and took some getting used to, but it works."
2,Dissapointing,"I waited for this book to come off the bestseller list for months.My wait was worthlessly spent. As with all of his books Grisham packed a great punch with all of the legal information, which I always find facinating, but when it came to the ending I was left feeling empty and dissapointed."
4,MAKES YOU SOOOO MAD...,"This was one of Grisham's finest....until the end. The end was completely unpredictable, but in a bad way. It made absolutely no sense. But it certainly did bring out quite an emotional stir out of me...as it did to others as far as i can tell from reading some of the reviews.Besides the ending, the book was an immensely quick read that I did not want to put down. The whole time you ask yourself how Patrick will get out of that jam, and Grisham almost always provides the perfect, but surprising answer.Read it..."
4,On your seat until the very last paragraph!,"Once again, John Grisham does an amazing job of keeping us in suspense until the very end. The characters are well developed, and the plausibility of the plot is to be commended. It is a must read for all Grisham fans!"
1,Boring!!!!,I couldn't stand this book. I could have cared less for the characters or the story. I treid to read it twice and listen to it on tape and it just made me angry. Grisham must be getting paid by the word!
3,WHEN LUCK RUNS OUT,"From succcessfully faking his own death,running away with 90 million dollars from his law firm, with practically all charges being droped against him. For a moment, Pattrick seemed to bethe luckiest man alive. Until he was betrayed by Eva. I still find it hard to believe. For some reason, I think she'll reappear sometime in the future.As I read these reviews, I've come to realized that I'm not the only one who has a problem with the way the book ended. Although, I wasn't necessarily looking for a happily ever after ending. I find the end sad and disappointing. And I'm still trying to figure out who that last female character that was introduced in the last couple of pages, who evantually led the Feds to Benny Aricia.For a moment, when I started reading this book, I thought it was the best book I've read by Grisham,until I got to the end. And my mouth just droped. And I was like, What was that?"
1,I despised the end because of its stupidity,"I constantly found myself attempting to understand all of the names that kept popping into the plot. It was a very boring book, an unrealistic scenario, and offensive from the standpoint of encouraging kooks who might think to attempt this same type of story. In the last chapter of the book they referred to a sentence that read they had found him. Who exactly are they? It was a terrible stupid ending as almost everyone in the chat room agrees."
2,"Very Weak, Look Elsewhere.","What an utter disappointment! I have read a few of Grisham's books, usually quite good. Unfortunately this is incredibly poor. Weak, unlikable characters. Shallow uninteresting story. Hands down the worst ending of any book I have read. Look at other Grisham books or move onto Crichton or Dan Brown for a better thriller."
4,Good read if you have the time and iterest.,"This book was very interesting like Grisham always is but I felt that sometimes, it was hard to keep up with. But overall, its worth the money."
4,"great book, a little predictable though",the book was great. i read it in a matter of five days simple because like many of his other books i can't simply put them down. I found the book to be a little predictable about half way through. I was indeed pissed off in the end though. It's worth the read that's for sure thought.
2,"Definitely not you best work, John","Dear John: You have fallen a long way since ""A Time toKill"", ""The Client"" and ""The Firm"". The leadmale and female characters in The Partner and Runaway Jury were much too similar, not to mention the plot to get hold of the money. Cloning may the new wave in technology, but I don't think it will work in fiction writing. Take your time John, don't be in such a hurry to crank out novels. When you write another high caliber novel such as I am accustomed to from you, I'll still be here, prepared to storm the bookstore; still your number one fan!"
2,"Hard to believe, with a poor ending","This is my first book of John Grisham and I must say: ""John, do you really think anything like this can actually happen?"". It's not that I want every book I read to be of precise realism, but from Death Row to Dead Body Mutilation ????. Even though we cannot punish lawyers from a more general standpoint for their role on our society, at least the character gets part of what he deserves. Another story is that the conclusion was expected almost 50 pages before the ending. Overall, I would have enjoyed more the book if I had not paid for it."
2,Worst Grisham I've Read So Far,"Continuing with my John Grisham binge (which I'm so not proud of, but I continue on with it anyway), I read this book, just randomly selected among many Grisham books at the local library.I would have to say that this was my least favorite Grisham book so far. I found the characters uninteresting, the story uninteresting, the storytelling uninteresting. Just not one of his best, in my opinion - seemed like this one he cranked out just to meet some obligation to the book company. The minor twist at the end was enjoyable, but not enough to save the book. I just didn't like the style, tone or storytelling. For example, I figured after chapter 1 (when Patrick gets caught) they'd go back in time to give some details, rather than only progressing forward. But it wasn't meant to be. Really didn't enjoy this one much, just slogged through it."
5,Right up there with The Firm!,"I am a big John Grisham fan, but have breezed through his last few books with not much fan fair. However, The Partner is definitely back up there with some of Grishams past (and best) novels. The plot is great, but the most brilliant parts are when Patrick is divulging how he got away with his own death. The planning is incredible and even though its fiction, you can't help but think ""Why can't I come up with something like that?"" The ending is disappointing, but not in a bad way. Its the best, most fitting ending this book could have. What goes around, comes around. Great book... I'd recommend it to everyone!"
5,No time for the bathroom,"I began reading this book in a lounge at LAX, waiting to board a flight to Tokyo. I usually use the bathroom every two hours, but The Partner had me glued to my window seat for 11 hours. Yes, this was the fastest transpacific flight ever. Thanks JG!"
5,Grisham's best book yet! Couldn't put this book down.,"This is an excellent book. It includes a great deal of the same old legal ramblings that Grisham is known for, but the mystery and complexity of the story are outstanding."
4,Excellent!,I read this book after reading the reviews by other individualsand for the life of me I don't understand why they found this book tobe one of his worst. For me it was non-stop reading until the end. I do agree the ending was something I didn't expect and thought it was unrealistic. It could have found a better ending.
2,It was pretty disappointing!,"Everything that Patrick thought would happen happened. The events turned out in the exact sequence and manner he predicted. All we (the readers, his pursuers)did was sit and watch it unfold. I know he was a great attorney, but noone is that thorough! And it doesn't make for an interesting book either. Where's the drama? The only thing that grabbed your attention was the huge amount of money. 90 million dollars! But beyond that, it was pretty boring! Grisham has done better."
3,"GOOD BEGIINNING, BORING IN THE END",FINISHED READING THE BOOK AND I MUST SAY IT IS NOT HIS BEST WORK. I WAS HOOKED AT FIRST BUT AS I CONTINUED IT BECAME PREDICTABLE AND BORING. GREAT BEGINNING BUT AS I WENT ON I LOST INTEREST.
3,Fast-food reading in its truest form,"A good, fast read. Predictable for the most part but enjoyable for what it is. Very typical Grisham."
5,Totally Awesome!,"This book was great. It taunts you with little mysteries right up to the climax, at which the big mystery is solved. The ending leaves you kind of cold, but its better than the stupid hapily ever after, guy-gets-the-girl ending."
4,"Very intreguing, delicately introduced but slow ending","Another masterpiece! Outstanding opening pages with lots of action and suspense, Grishman creates a real thriller. We become one with the characters. The first few chapters of the main character being tortured is amazing. I can't give it 5 stars because of the poor ending. I think it could have been more dramatic or entertaining. It wasn't a terrible ending but needed a little more spice in it. Sure, he got a taste of his own medicine but needed more conflict. Don't get me wrong, it was a great book but needs a stronger ending. I would definitely recommend it."
4,Good read. Dissapointing ending. (spolier!),"Like many said here, the beginning of the book was kind of boring but things picked up rather quickly when Patrick starts to tell the truth. The ending however, was very very disappointing..how and why would the girl Eva do such a thing like this to the man she loves or loved did it mean that money finally wins??? And what about her dad? is she going to ditch her dad as well since she knows that Patrick knows where her dad is and she knows that he'll return to Brazil..this is just not making sense here...Despite the bad ending...this is a good read."
2,Disappointed in this one ...,"I just finished this book the other night and actually threw my book down in disgust. I hated the ending. I don't have a lot of free time, so the fact that I wasted it on this book particularly ticked me off. The beginning is intriguing but it goes downhill from there. I have read Grisham's other works and have really enjoyed them, but this book was missing the suspense that his other works contain (and that I love). This book was mediocre at best."
3,Dependable light entertainment,Grisham is GREAT on story telling but weak on character development. They do make good airport and airplane reading though. Fast and forgettable.
3,A typical Grisham novel,"The Partner is a typical Grisham novel about a lawyer who has a secret, hatches a plot, and gets caught. Most of the novel is about the lawyer, Patrick Lanigan, trying to save himself from being convicted of a crime. Like most Grisham novels this one has twists and surprises and enough of a plot to hold my attention. Unlike so many of the other reviewers, I really liked the ending. I thought it was a perfect twist and a great conclusion to the book. When I am in the mood for mindless entertainment, I often turn to Grisham and The Partner served this purpose well for me. I was not stirred, changed, or left wanting more, I was simply entertained, which is exactly what I was wanting when I purchased this book. So, 3 stars for an entertaining read."
3,wakley cd,"Cd is fine. Quality excellent,response time quick. Would have preferred more of his better songs, however, I ordered it for a friend."
5,Hall & Oates Return To The Top!,"This has now become my favorite collection from Daryl Hall & John Oates. There is no other album in their collection to compare this to either. As one fan put it ""This is not your parent's Hall & Oates, this is not your Hall & Oates, this is your kid's Hall & Oates"". I think not only their solo projects have affected their sound but also working with outside producers on the original versions of some of these songs. Touring so much the last 5 1/2 years definitely has made it's mark as well as all of these songs are very ""live"" sounding and should translate really well to the stage. Highlights include the #1 AC hit ""Do It For Love"", the current top 10 hit ""Forever For You"" as well as the funky ""Miss DJ"" the rocking ""Make You Stay"" the R & B tinged ""Breath Of Your Life"" and the bouncing opener ""Man On A Mission"". The guys are revitalized and are as revelant as ever."
5,Prodigious performances!,"Mark Ermler made a fascinating account of this set of symphonies. By reasons of musical architecture, the Second Symphony is the best known of his works. It keeps the captivating Caucasian spirit, the obvious Russian reminiscences built with a portentous musicality that has allowed it to be used as musical ballet frame and incidental music.There are two previous famous versions: Silvio Varviso and Ernest Ansermet, but this one in particular has such force and conviction power that it makes a wonderful contribution for all those who appreciate these minor works if you want, but nice to listen them from time to time to rejoin with the Group of the Five.(Cesar Cui, Mussorgsky, Balakirev, Rimsky).Specially recommended the Second and the Third."
2,Decided not to buy.,"Thanks to these reviews, I decided not to buy one. I bought a plain one from Wal Mart for about $15. The wells may not be quite as deep or rounded, but so far it seems to handle the recipes just fine. Thankfully, the maker of this item has their recipes available at their website, which is the only thing I wanted from this anyway."
1,Save your money,"This item is great for infant sized portions. The non stick coating wore off after about 5 uses despite following instructions for seasoning. Cleaning was an absurdity. Food particles got stuck in the gap between the lid and the base. Burned on food had to be scraped off. We threw it away after about 10 days. We didn't even bother to unpack the second ""free' one. That went the way of the first.Save your money and use a frying pnn."
4,dillo's reviews from down under,"Wow!! One not to be missed. Highly underated in all areas, direction, production, script and acting. Now how could anyone not like a film with two of the best actresses of recent times giving 100%- I refer to Fairuza Balk and Gabrielle Anwar. Top them off with a wonderful effort from Andy Garcia and Steve Buscemi and this really is a collectable, in whatever format you can grab hold of. One of the top 20 films in my collection of over 3500."
3,Things To Do in Denver when You're Dead,It arrived very timely and in good condition. Had seen it when it first came out & liked it. My husband loved it but I'd forgotten that it was so dark - so I quit watching. (he'd have given it a 5-star rating.
5,They had me fooled until the very end.,This is a really good movie for those of you whom enjoy amovie that makes you think. The plot twist at the very end andleaves you thinking about it long after the movie is over.
2,The plan was stupid to begin with!,"Didn't they know better than to work with that psycho? Didn't they suspect that something was going to go wrong? And the kid was stupid to keep opening up his mouth! I found it excrutiating, waiting for the ""buckwheats."" I wouldn't look at this movie again."
4,"Love it, Love it, Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Bought this movie after renting it. Can't say enough good things about it. My favorite actor (Andy Garcia) is in it. Highly recommend this movie to all the true Andy Garcia fans out there! Interesting language and twists during the entire movie. I watch it over and over again. Never get tired of it. Once you've seen it, you'll want to own it."
4,Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead.,"Honestly, this movie is bit of star casting masterpiece. Treat Williams and Christopher Walken alone are Oscar worthy nods for their performances in this indy jewel. Well...ok. Maybe that is a stretch but TTDIDWYD is black comedy genius and one of Andy Garcia's best roles to date in my opinion. The story is simple yet woven nicely to tell a story of mortality and what a bitch it really is when it's nipping at your heels. It never pays to go against your instincts or deal with a crime boss that has all the cards for easy money. There is some geniune saddness here and bittersweet romance interplayed with a thriller withlittle in a way of a happy ending. But life is usually not always about happy endings anyway. This is a great classic and a shame it didn't get wider viewing during it's day."
4,Great Cast - Interesting Story,"I like Andy Garcia in just about anything, including this movie. The other cast members, Warden, Walken, and Lloyd are also excellent. I got a very Terrintino feeling from this movie. Its a yearly view for me."
1,Disappointing,"Surely Mr. Gatto has stumbled upon something of importance, I don't deny that. Most readers though may find this book largely pointless because nothing is sourced.There is no bibliography. Quotations are not cited.For example I was reading on page 40 that Max Mason says the new education model is for 'the control of human behavior.' When I read this I thought ""wow that's interesting."" Then I proceeded to find the source of this claim. This is what I found on page 391:'Should I now attempt to dazzle you with this grotesque assemblage arranged into a formal bibliography. I'll concede it would hardly have been possible ...'Worthless."
3,annoying musical score,"I had no problem with the story line in this video. Definetly 5 stars there. What makes this the least wacthable of all the Veggie tales videos is the annoying musical score which compares very badly with the fun cacthy songs in ""where's God when I'm scared"". With the exception of ""I'm so blue"" there is not one fun catchy song in this video. Most annoying of all is a silly song with Lunt, Which sounds like something Steve Tyler Of ""Aerosmith"" fame would write while suffering from a drug induced case of Muchies. Please bring back silly songs with Larry"
2,Just not that good for adults.,"I have loved every Veggie Tale up to this one. They're fun and kinda nuts... and while kids love them, they also work on a level which the kids miss but appeals greatly to adults. That is, until this one. If you're an adult, and you're not trying to teach your little kids to avoid materialism, buy another Veggie Tale video -- any one other than ""Madame Blueberry""."
3,1000TC is Great!,"Ever since I've been on my snobby ""I only sleep on 800+ thread count sheets I've always looked for deals. These sheets are worth it. They are soft and very comfortable. The only annoying thing about high thread count sheets is how wrinkled they get. But the world is just not perfect. I'm waiting to see how many times I can wash them before they start balling up. So far so good."
5,Great read,"Marilyn Meredith writes a page turner that holds your interest. The main character, Tempe Crabtree becomes a friend you hope to revisit. I am looking forward to the other books that follow Deadly Omen."
3,Bissell Filters,"I ordered the wrong filters, so I really can't review this item.No complaints, just can't review something I ordered wrong.The correct item was mailed to me, I made the mistake."
1,one star as a coffee warmer,"On top of the case of the JVC RX-D206B is a white sticker printed in red with the message""Caution: To protect from risk of fire or electrical shock don't put any objects on top/sides, don't block them, and do keep proper ventilation."" The case for this receiver/amplifier became too hot to touch, and since it was my intention to install this device in a cabinet for a bedroom music system, I felt it presented too much risk even with ventilation fans installed. I had bought the device for its low profile, but perhaps that is its inherent problem. In any case I either received a defective item or it suffers from a defective design. Therefore I have returned it to the seller and purchased a stereo amplifier as a replacement."
1,Very Poor Quality,"This set was unbelievibly low quality. The ends were hot glued on, and they were in the box, not on the swords. The paint was chipped off of the sheath on 2 of them, and there is a little wooden piece glued on the sides of the sheath.... All three were broken. I was expecting to not get the greatest quality because of the price, but I was not expecting this. It is the week before Christmas, so I am super gluing the pieces back together, but I would never recommend this product to anyone, try a different set!"
3,Good at first but ...,"I find these slippers vital around the house when you don't want to wear shoes: I have problems with balance and am apt to fall, so I need something to grip the floor with a rubber sole. These are great at first - nice and light - but after 3 washings or so, the elastic around the opening becomes loose at the heel. One can walk out of them, which is very, very dangerous!Also note the shipping cost is outrageous: about equivalent to the cost of the item!"
4,Great!!!!,"My husband has been a friend of Max's for quite a long time, and I think his music is wonderful. The CD does not do him justice. I have heard him live many times, and nothing compares. Only hope he will make another CD soon."
5,Cameta Slave Flash,"Unlike the Canon HF-DC1 external flash, the Cameta flash has a rotatable head, so you can use it for bounce flash. It also has 5 delay options compared to the Canon's single delay setting. Add to that the fact that it costs substantially less than the Canon flash, so all in all, it's a no-brainer."
1,One Who Knows,I have sat in the author's classroom while he used this book to teach the class and I must say that I agree with the other reviews. I have since then gone onto graduate and I am now working in the printing industry. I have never been asked to use any of the information I learned from this book while on the job. Not only did I feel short changed by buying this book but I also had to pay for many of the author's classes that also gave me useless information that would only come in handy if I owned a time machine and was able to go back to 1970 and work in the industry. What I did with this book is I gave it to a student who had not taken the class yet but I made them promise that they will also give the book to someone else for free when they are done with it. I hope that it will catch on because I do not want the author or bookstores to make money selling a book that will have no use for the buyer.
1,t is a deception not inclluye the lifeguards,"t is a deception not inclluye the lifeguards,In the advertisement he says that it contains the lifeguards and in the photos of the product they appear clearly.I hope that they return my money, otherwise I am going to denounce them and they them were forcing that to return many mas that it and they were eliminating his license.I wait for response."
1,So many things wrong,"This game is sooo bad. The makers of the game went to so much trubble to include extensive attributes for all players but once the game starts, all the players run atthe same speed, all the batters have the same shot at a HR, all the balls hit are of the same trajectory and all the pitchers throw there own pitches at same velocity. (Example- Pedro's fastball is always 93,94) I'm not the kind of person who usually gets on the computer to complain but I feel that this game is so over rated that anyone considering buying it should know these things first."
2,Not Worth the Price,1/3 of the drawer slides were not properly glued and had to be re-glued by me. The total cost of the cabinet exceeds what it is worth. I recently paid 235.00 for a desk made of oak and the construction is far superior to the cd 235 walnut cabinet
1,Return,Cabinet was damaged upon arrival. I am trying to return. Have sent e-mails describing damage and asking for pickup and return and refund but haven't received an acknowledgement.
2,Decent Blues Disc By Willie Trice,"This is a decent Blues disc from Willie Trice, with the following songs standing out: ""I've Had Trouble"", ""New Careless Love Blues"" and, especially, ""Troublesome Mind"", which has different guitar work than I've heard on any other Blues song. The problem with this album is that the rest of the songs just don't have the same quality as the three I just mentioned. If you are a serious collector who wants a cheap Blues cd, buy this one."
5,The Yachting Cookbook,"Honestly, this is the best cookbook I've ever owned because the recipes are do-able under different circumstances, and they invariably turn out well. A friend gave it to me years ago because we picnicked on our boat so often, but I use it mostly ""off boat"" now and am still trying out new recipes."
3,"Not as good as the first one, but not bad.","The first one was great, but this one serves as more of an intro to the Christian message of the series. Good songs, and there's still plenty of silliness to go around. The Cebu song, and Mr. Lunt's Cheeseburger Love Song are classics. it's too bad there's no Pirates Who Don't Do Anything II..."
5,Quite a bite for your buck! :),"These ears are HUGE! They are not greasy and you get a lot of ear for the money. I have three large dogs, one of which is older and missing some teeth. This ear lasts her a LONG time, and it takes the other dogs, who have perfectly fine teeth, at least 45-60 minutes to chew one of these to smithereens. I really appreciate the dryness of these; I hate the feel and odor of greasy pig ears."
1,Buyer Beware,"This is nothing more than a blatant repackage (for the Umpteenth time) of Anne's early ""What About Me"" album, without the studio version of the title track. If you don't already have it, it might be worth it to you, but I doubt it. The recording has been reissued so many times I imagine the tapes must be threadbare by now (and the vinyl version I purchased in the 70s didn't sound too good). Proceed with caution."
4,Textbook,This book covers a range of topics related to modern families. Both it's content and photos are up-to-date. There may even be a picture of the Obamas on p. 17! The book is easy to read.
5,A must read for people with APS and APS families and friends,Written for the patient with detailed and complete information. I believe anyone will learn a number of important life saving things from this book. It is especially informative for friends and family of APS afflicted people. Obviously written by a knowledgeable and caring author who has experienced the problems created by this disease and has a lot of experience dealing with others who also have the disease.
4,"highly recommend this, great for the newly diagnosed","Easy reading, describes sticky blood (aka antiphospholipid antibody syndrome or Hughes Syndrome) through the eyes of a patient. Especially recommend it for the newly diagnosed. Describes the disease in easy-to-understand terms, from diagnosis to treament. Recommend."
2,OK,It was ok. Very easy to read. It reminded me of a chapter book in grade school. Large print for those of you who are very hard of seeing.
1,Junk,"I bought two of these fixtures from my 150g fresh water tank. Just after the Amazon return period passed, one the fixtures stopped working. It's only been two months since I bought them. When I took it apart to see what the problems was, I found it. The plastic bracket was holding the end of the lights was broken. I can tell from the low quality of the internal plastics that these lights are made cheaply. I'm disappointed in the manufacturer Aqueon and now Amazon because I've wasted over $50."
1,Not worth the money!,"The ballast itself appears slim, but cheaply made. The plastic piece that slides over the bulb encasement flies out every time I move the light or remove it to change the water in the tank. The metal bars to hold the light over the tank are no more than glorified paper clip wire.The bulbs.... oh the bulbs. The first one died at about 3 months, and the second one died TODAY (~4.5 months). Considering the bulbs are as much as 60-70% the price of the unit, it might make sense to just keep buying the unit. However, my discus prefer (and frankly deserve) something a little more consistent and reliable.I should also mention that the cheap plastic I referred to above has partially melted (despite the relatively low temps of T5 bulbs without my knowledge (just found this out when I noticed the first bulb was blown.I recommend you DO NOT purchase this product if you need reliable and consistent lighting (especially if your plants/fish depend on it)."
1,"One bulb dead in less than 2 months, now completely dead @ 4 months.","I was happy with this fixture. It works well on my 29 gallon 30"" tank. However, less than 2 months after purchase, one bulb is out and the other one is very dark on one end. I went to Petsmart and picked up 2 new bulbs (for almost the cost of this fixture). And now it's working well again. Hopefully this was a fluke with the bulbs that came with the fixture.UPDATE: 4 months later and it's dead. This light or it's ballasts must be poorly made. The light flashes on briefly if you tap the top of it, and then it flickers on and off. Additionally the new bulbs I put in about 2 months ago are already very dark on the ends. What a disappointment. I really liked the slim style, and fairly affordable. But all that means nothing if it doesn't work."
1,Very Unhappy,"We ordered this light for our 9yr old daughter's fish tank.The light fixture was damaged when it finally arrived tonight by (UPS Ground!) well after 7pm 1/12/12 even though tracking indicated that shipment was out for delivery since around noon from the next town over. A bulb had broken inside and damaged the fragile reflector which is only made of thin foil film by the way. The packaging was insufficient allowing the box containing the fixture to rattle around inside the shipping box. Glass was all over our kitchen table and floor. My daughter has been bugging me all week about this light! So, she wasn't too happy when she saw the mess. I opted to replace the item. Why do I even need a return label(more hassle)? They should just come and get it. As it is they're saying I have to wait until 1/19/12 for the replacement to arrive. The replacement should go out immediately if they really regret our bad experience! I'll be really disgusted if we don't get a replacement very soon!"
1,misadvertised misused and abused,there were 7 discs missing 2 that i particularly wanted {brandenberg 1-3 and the magnificat. other discs wre defaced { unplayable } if i hadn't destroyed the packaging i would have returned it immediatly do i haveANY RECOURSE ?
4,"Wonderful set, great price","The performances on these CDs are top-notch, using original instruments and authentic Baroque performance practice. The organ performances are a bit cloudy at times, but overall, this is an excellent set."
1,When good Giga's go Bad,"I purchaced this phone thru another retailer, not Amazon.com,then came here to shop for a replacement for my busted analog Sonycordless. I was dismayed to see that Amazon was selling such a worthless phone. I found the phone to be handsomely styled and loved its efficient, clean look. But I found that in practice, the indestinguishable buttons were a pain. Furthermore I experienced the loss of audio another reviewer mentioned where I could hear the person on the other end but they couldnt hear me. Needless to say after a week of struggle, the thing went straight back to where I got it from. Do NOT buy this phone. END"
2,Very Disappointed,"When I bought this phone I was truly excited about the size, features and price of the phone. However, using it was a totally different situation. Callers said there was always an echo on the other end of the phone and I found battery life to be dismal -- about 36 hours before drainage after a full recharge! Mine has been returned and now I'm in search of a different brand. I can only hope Seimans improves on what is a great idea but a subpar end result."
1,Poor quallity,"First of all, the sound quality is awful. It sounds like a cell phone on both ends. The battery life is awful, so I'm always tethered to the base, which defeats the whole purpose of a cordless. The phone also ""crashes"" quite often. Phones aren't supposed to crash! It takes a lot of coercing to get it working again after this happens. Also, to change any setting, to redial a number, or to access a speed dial number, you have a to through a whole maze of menus. It takes four button presses to redial a number! You have to confirm it and bla bla bla, it's like I'm using a computer. ""Are you sure you want to redial?"" Wow.Overall a very fickle, poorly designed phone."
2,"Nice phone, low battery replacement cost, what... NO MUTE???","Ok, this is a nice phone for ($). Got it from ... for ($) with a ($) rebate from Siemens.The primary reason I selected this phone is because of the relatively inexpensive battery replacement. VTech wants ($)per battery for my old 900 MHz phone - that is criminal. Using AA batteries guarantees that the Siemens 2400 series will have minimal maintenance cost.BUT.... what systems/marketing genius decided to leave out the MUTE feature? I attend teleconferences where it is mandatory to use mute to avoid feedback from 20 other attendees. Also, it is just common courtesy to mute before flushing the toilet! (As if any of you readers don't take the phone into the 'potty' room )Sorry Siemens... close, but no cigar, this phone goes back."
2,"Shouting ""Don't hang up""!","I'm afraid we must agree with reviewer: synelg from Alaska who advised ""Don't buy this phone!""We also thought it was a great phone at first. But, after a little more than a year of use, our friends and family report that our conversation regularly breaks up about 10 minutes into each call and they can't hear us. We find ourselves shouting, ""We can still hear you, don't hang up"" as we run for our old corded phone in the basement. We replaced the NiCad batteries in both handsets, with no improvement.We had a replacement warranty and will now give the Siemens Gigaset 4015 we received a try, but I find myself wondering if we might be better off with a Uniden TRU448-2, an AT&T 2255, or a VTech VT2461."
3,Frozen Cliches,"I had high hopes after the first few chapters that this was going to be an entertaining suspense/myestery. Sympathetic protagonist, bucolic setting, compelling drama. Sadly, my expectations were crushed as the story descended into a welter of cliches normally associated with made-for-tv movies. The story promises to be a kind of small town mystery with unique characters and memorable insights. The author regretably felt compelled to throw in an international crime syndicate, incrediable series of twists and complications that prompted more questions than answers and fnally an action climax that produced more groans than suspense. I was left with one outstanding question - who killed the editor?"
1,No good,"This is one of the distasteful books I have ever read. If I were not determined to finish each book I start, I would never have made it to the bitter end. The characters are one-dimensional with no redeeming qualities. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Gaseous, but smart.When the astronomy types detect a giant titular object heading Earth's way, they get rather stressed, and there is a bit of a conspiracy to keep things quiet.It becomes a bit hard to do that when it turns up, and it is discovered it is actually intelligent, not just your random cosmic disaster.2.5 out of 5"
3,The title track saves the day.,"If not for ""Who Do You Think We Are,"" I might not ever touch this disc. Some other songs are okay, ""You're a Movie"" is amusing, and ""Skeletons in the Closet"" is almost creepy, but they're nothing to really drool over. ""Who Do You Think We Are"" is worth drooling over, as I often do, but I can't see too many people buying this album who aren't die hard fans. Of the four early 80s albums by Alice, DaDa is by far the best. Special Forces isn't awful, but it is (dare I say) kind of boring."
3,Special Freakness!,"Well i must say that this album is a cool one,I bought it already back in the 80's when it was released, didn't appreciate it then but now i must say it's a pretty fun record with very nice lyrics if you listen to them carefully. It's not at all the standard like the billion sellar albums from the 70's but it's in my opinion a fun,cool and listenable album"
3,"Great, however, both Latin Albums should have reissued in one CD","The sound of this CD is crispy clear. I did not hear any unwanted noises (as indicated by another reviewer) even with Monitor Headphones in any of the tracks in this CD.While this CD is solid with great interpretations of beautiful Spanish songs, I feel that both ""The Latin Album"" and ""The Second Latin Album"" should have been included in one CD since each of these albums run for only 30min, which is quite short by current standards. It is not uncommon that a classic Vinyl LP album of short duration be reissued into a CD with either bonus tracks or together with another classic album by the same performer. See for example, reissued albums of Kingston Trio."
3,Sure its poppy ...,"Yeah, its true. Every song on here is a repeat. Its all poppy ... but for some reason I cant stop listening to it. If I were you I wouldnt buy it just because its so readily available to download online."
5,"Polished, Harmonized group shows true talent","So Much For The Afterglow seems to be to be a great, cutting edge album. Not like other artists, Everclear relates to average life, with the song ""Father of Mine"". The harmonies between the singers and even the instruments is great, and it shows that these players have practiced. Great album all around, nice cover too. I loved the continuation wrap..."
3,"Good at first, but it gets old","This CD was really great when I got it, but it gets old pretty quickly. Granted, I still do like a couple of the tracks on the CD, but would usually rather listen to something else. I must admit though that ""So Much for The Afterglow"" can really get you going."
2,This CD...........,.....ROTS. the only good songs r Father of mine & I will Bye u a new life.So here u got my opinion.
4,You should buy this CD,Everclear is great group with some great songs. This CD should be added to your collection.
1,What a crappy album!!!!!,"Where is music heading? This terrible band has put out another bad album and somehow American kids have embraced these guys. I can't stand this music. the songs are all repetitive and have no beat. None of the songs have catcht tunes, they are just monotone ramblings with whining guitars in the background. Better luck next album boys."
5,Great cd,"This has to be one of my favorite cds. Every song is great. I can listen to the whole cd and not skip any songs. A true classic. My favorites are everything to everyone, normal like you, and sunflowers. If you don't have it, go buy this cd now!"
5,Great value and a great CD to listen to.,I feel this is one of the best CD's I have ever listened to. Thanks for making it so easy to buy and making it so much cheaper than going to the store. Thanks a bunch Amazon.
4,Buy this if you like rock. You won't be disappointed,"Other reviewers are correct in saying that many of these songs sound the same, but overall this CD is enjoyable and carries a lot of emotion. ""Normal Like You"" and ""One Hit Wonder"" are both good and sound the same, while ""So Much For the Afterglow"" and ""Amphetamine"" are both good and sound the same. We have no modern rock radio here in Cleveland anymore, but I am surprised that ""White Men in Black Suits"" never became a sleeper hit. I didn't like this song at first, but it really began to grow on me after a while. I don't like ""Like a California King"" or ""I Will Buy You a New Life,"" but these are the only two songs I dislike on this disc. If you like rock, then you will like this album. Oh yeah, it's much better than Everclear's previous album, ""Sparkle and Fade."""
2,All the songs sound the same,"I didn't buy this album. Although I don't think it's nessesary since it seems Everclear is planning on airing all their songs on the radio anyway. All I have to say is that I can't believe almost nobody notices that all the sons use the same chords, over and over again. The only reason I gave this CD an extra star its because some of the lyrics are good and were written with a good purpose, although expressed through a bad medium. I honestly think there's room for improvement... A LOT of room."
5,I really loved this CD. Everclear is the best band ever.,I found this CD to be both relevant to my personal life and to my friend's lives. I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes awesome music.
5,awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,the best cd on the entire planet.no one can come close to being as good as this one!!!if you dont have this cd...what you waiting for??go get it!!u dont know what ur missing!!it is the absolute best!
3,Routine TV Movie,"Mary Higgins Clark might write to a formula but she does it very skillfully to maximize suspense. This film retains the formula but provides weak character development and an overly familiar plot line. The best (girl) friend of a TV producer is murdered while on assignment from the producer. Against professional advice, the producer sets out to follow the path of the murdered woman in order to find the killer.The film is no worse than the average crime show, the acting is no better than average and the suspense is predictable. If available inexpensively it will fill your time adequately if unexcitinglyly."
5,5 port usb card,If you need addition ports for your usb and you have an open slot this is a very good card.
2,Don't bother,I bought this because my little one's head was not supported by the head rest that came with her carrier. This head rest was not much support either. My biggest complaint was that it didn't come with any instructions. There are velcro tabs on it but what are they for? My babies head was not supported. I ended up exchanging it for a snuzzler and love it.
5,Thumbsucker review,"For an indie, the lack of obnoxious dialog makes Thumbsucker more enjoyable than other recent indie films about high school students. The student counselor who makes Justin's ADD diagnosis with a pamphlet shows a popular additude towards students like him. The Polyphonic Spree made a very fitting soundtrack and the visual effects are subtle. ""Neo"" as the dentist is a nice touch."
4,Better than average movie,"A 17 year old Justin still sucks his thumb so his parents reluctantly give him meds as recommended by the school's psychologist. She thinks he has ADHD. He improves and stops sucking his thumb. He even starts to excel in school. Still, he has to overcome teen angst by just plain growing up and learn to deal with problems in his own way.I liked this movie. I like the actors in it and the plot. Keanu Reeves as a new age orthodontist trying to cure Justin's thumbsucking is funny and he plays the role well."
1,Poorly Constructed & Cheap Looking,"I ordered both the mustard & the ketchup because I have two dachshunds and thought it would be adorable. Unfortunately the ketchup arrived with one of the buns only half attached and therefore could not be used at all. The mustard arrived intact and held up alright to the dogs chewing on them however, not long after chewing on his costume (he was not allowed to chew enough to get pieces or to swallow anything) my dog began to throw up which makes me very concerned as to what chemicals were used in the fabric and the filling. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT if your dog chews on things it could make him sick!!!In the event you do still buy this product aim for a size bigger than you initially think you should get as they tend to run smaller than they advertise and the straps are quite tight."
3,Good Looking Costume but a Little Flimsy in the Construction,"It's a good thing Halloween doesn't come around very often. I don't think this costume would last very long. It is cute, but not very well made."
4,cute but not quality,"I bought this as a Halloween costume for my ~11 lb ""tweenie"" doxie. It was certainly the right size and I'm glad I didn't go with a small. While the costume is very cute, I can see where the complaints about quality come from. The attachments of the mustard and buns to the velcro straps isn't very secure. The buns are also a little too thick (up and down, not actual thickness) for a dog with such low legs. The mustard part is a little floppy. I didn't keep it on my dog for too long because our other dog thought it was a toy and was trying to play with it like one, but I don't think it would have stayed well on my puppy too well because of the attachment. I'd recommend if you're looking for an inexpensive, cute costume for your dog for a short amount of time. If you want something for your dog to wear for hours again and again, be prepared to do some sewing or go with another costume."
1,Complete Aladdin Recordings~ Floyd Dixon,"Complete Aladdin Recordings~ Floyd Dixon Are these CDs the one made in America, the one manufactured by Europe? It is ordered by the postal money order like usual. Do the confirmation of the stock before you tell all costs."
5,Kids love it!,"My kids love watching this! We especially like to sing the Silly Song, Barbara Manatee. It is nice to be able to refer back to this when something happens in the real world. They have a point of reference and can relate with selfish behaviors they exhibit or see in someone else."
2,Boring and repetitive,"Evil Dead: A Fistful of Boomstick is nice looking game, with some great lighting effects and extra touches like leaves blowing in the wind. Downside.. it's really, really dark.Bruce Campbell voices Ash's dialog, which should please fans of the Evil Dead movies.This game is boring, so boring that it's hard to play long enough to get to some of the game's more interesting elements like the selection of different weapons or the ability to cast a few spells.If you want to play this game, I suggest renting it first. Shooting and slashing zombies can be fun, but after a while it gets really boring."
2,"Good Delivery, Faulty Product",The CD came promptly and outwardly in good order. But when played the CD has a flaw in it. A nasty spot under the protective layer effecting a couple of the tracks.
2,4 matches cant save this.,"2 1/2. Some matches were great, match of the year candidates but Backlash 2002 is just not worth buying.1.Cruiserweight championship: Billy Kidman vs Tajiri W/torrie.10/10 , amazing cruiserweight action here!2.Bradshaw vs. scott Hall 3/10:Whats this?!?3.Womens championship:Trish vs. Jazz 1.5/10 Not as good as their past matches.4.Brock Lesner vs. Jeff hardy 4/10 this was a push match for Brock to showcase his stuff.5.Edge vs. Kurt angle 8.5/10 Great match with great ending.6.Intercontinental Championship: Rob van Dam vs.Eddie Guerrero. Good match 8/107.Undertaker vs. stone cold steve austin Special Referee:Ric Flair. Took forever to actually start shocking ending when watching live but to buy .... 2/108.Tag team championship:Billy and chuck w/rico vs.Maven and Al snow Booo!!! 1/10.9.Undisputed championship: Triple H vs.Hulk Hogan.the match was horrible until the ending where Y2j,taker interfered. 5/10Overall 5/10"
2,Backlash 2002,This ppv was at all one of the worst ppv in my life the only good one was the womens on The main event was not at all what i expected it to be it was a as bad as the first match the rvd eddie match was also a good one all in all this is not a good ppv
5,Tsubo's are great shoes.,"I fell in love with Tsubo's after randomly ordering them from a Victoria's Secret catalog. I've ordered my husband four pairs already and he wears them everyday. They are light, durable, and super comfy. Never any blisters and I can walk in them for days. We get compliments all the time and they are very stylish."
3,Blondie/Debbie is to good to be remixed,"I love all the original Blondie/Debbie albums.Once more into the bleach would not have been nescesarry for me. The Call me remixed by Ben Liebrand is interesting the rest of the re-mixes are just to far behind the original beauty's.Maybe this album is interesting for non album songs like Feel the spin and, Rush, Rush but therefore I recommend: Most of all...the best of Deborah Harry"
4,Nearly perfect USB 2.0 SD Card Reader,"The Simple Tech BONZAI USB 2.0 Card Reader is nearly perfect! It supports SD memory sizes up to at least 4GB so far that I have tested and never seems to have connection problems of any kind. My only problem with it and all other SD card readers that I know of, is that none of them seem to support any speeds past 9MB per second, even though practically every brand supports SD memory now supports 15MB per second or faster. I see no reason why companies making the SD readers can go faster, like the external interface on USB hard drives do."
4,Solid product...so far,"I purchased a 4gb memory card for my Dell 700m, not realizing that the computer (which has a SD slot) does not support cards with that much memory. Based on another review, I purchased this product. It works great; the reading and writing is very fast. The thing has a weird, flimsy plastic piece protecting the card slot which feels like it will break in 2 weeks, but not a huge deal. Also, it is weird that shipping was so much. The product is solid though."
1,No instructions,"I recieved the product as a gift for my baby shower. When trying to place it in the stroller, I had no idea how to...there were no instructions how to install it properly... So i returned it"
2,No instructions,"This product looks very comfy, but it did not come with instructions as someone mentioned. The main problem is tangling the seatbelt of the babyseat through it without making baby uncomfortable. Also there are fabric hoops, and who knows what they are for... they are not for the seatbelt either. Especially for baby really needs to get instructions out for this one."
4,Typical Timothy Wright,"Since I was born and raised in Brooklyn, I have followed Rev. Wright for a long time. This album has a few of his classics, along with some new songs."
2,Adesso cafe chair,"The color and style are ok. However, the seat is too smal, therefore makes it uncomfortable to sit on . i cannot recommend this chair for any adult."
3,Check before you buy...,"I registered for this item and realized that my carseat already has this feature. Check to make sure that you carseat has this feature before you go out and get an unecessary piece. Otherwise, this would be a GREAT piece to have for your little one."
5,A Warm and Interesting Look,"After reading this book, her husband's second book, and finally her second memoir, I did have a profound respect for her dignity, love for her family, and stamina. This book was an easy read and was absolutely fascinating to go along on exotic trips and learning about the side kick's day to day existence as wife to President. The book made me admire the Bush's as a couple more, the love for their kids and each other, and their principles, even if I did not agree with all of the latter."
5,it goes hard,This is the best screw theory in tha Northside its tha hardest hittin cd i tha nation I played it at a party and it got every one crunk
5,Inspiring!,I bought this for my husband as a gift after seeing the PBS special on Christmas in Yellowstone. He worked there one summer as a college student and loves telling about his time there. Now I want all of Tom Murphy's books on all the seasons in Yellowstone!
3,Some flaws,"Even though I'm Jewish, my 3-year-old son and I love VeggieTales, because despite its Christian background, it mostly refers to the Old Testament (the Christmas one is the only one that's overtly Christian, as it certainly should be). It's fun and entertaining and moral and educational, and I haven't found anything to disagree with, even though I'm not Christian...."
1,Drying Paint would be Preferable,"I wanted to like this film, I really did, but it was the slowest moving film I've ever seen. Potentially a good story, it was spoiled by poverty-stricken dialogue, long pauses and a lack of action. Charley fell in love with Eban but it was impossible to figure out why - Eban had a black hole where his personality should have been and ""scintillate"" was clearly not a word in his vocabulary. Most gay teachers are quite charismatic; not Eban! Could do better."
4,Very Helpful,Definitely got a lot out of this book. Lots of great examples and concepts that we put to use right away. Highly recommended for intermediate developers working with .NET.
5,A good alternative to the Sexual Dysfunction Clinic,"I recommend this book to my patients because we live in an area where there are no Psychiatrists running a Sexual Dysfunction Clinic. I am not even aware of anyone doing ""sex therapy"" per se in our area. I recommend this text to couples who are commited to making their relationship better by working on their sexual compatibility. The program that this book is based on is a 7 week program in which couples attend for a 5 hour session every week. There is a group lecture and then the couples pair off with their therapy team usually consisting of a male and female therapist licensed to practice in the State of Illinois. Many are physician's in training, medical doctors studying to be Psychiatrists. This book is written in easy language and can be followed at home, by the couple.."
3,good for first month,after my son turned 1 month his head kept falling to the outside of the headrest just about to his knees! it was very scary looking from the rear veiw mirror while trying to drive once we took it out he was just fine.
3,Not too bad,"I purchased this product after my daughter was born.The installation took me a while to figure out.Slide the top of the carseat strap into the slit of the headrest (it should have about the same width as the slit), open the velcro and hook it around the loop then fasten it back.The strap stays in the slit and the headrest doesn't fall out of the carseat when you lift the baby out.I gave this product 3 stars because even though I like its fit around the baby's head and its softness, I wish it had more support on the sides and kept its shape better.It works well in the swing or bouncer seat though."
1,JUNK,"The umbrella came in ripped at the top and missing the cap. I contacted the manufacturer who said they would send a return label to ship it back, which I never received.I'm tossing it, save your money and buy somewhere else."
5,Absorbing and insightful,This updated book contains some of the most absorbing and insightful summaries of personality theories I have read. The section on Erikson epitomizes his work in a way I have not seen elsewhere. The chapter on Maslow is a balanced view of the strengths and limitations of his theory. The chapter on evolutionary psychology is a clear summary and introduction to this field.
3,Good follow up to Fallacy Detective,"This book is a great follow-up to The Fallacy Detective, and includes several important steps to logical thinking not found in The Fallacy Detective (such as the reliability of sources, that the argument with the most ""reasons"" isn't necessarily right, etc.). As a stand-alone, I don't think it's as strong as The Fallacy Detective; some of the lessons feel repetitive (they acknowledge this humorously at one point).A friend of mine expressed interest that we were using the Bluedorns' books in our classes, as she had some previous Bluedorn books and said they were strict and dry. Apparently, the books she has were written by the parents; this book is written by Hans and Nathaniel, their sons. It presents the subject matter in an enjoyable and often comedic way. The material really stuck with the kids in my class, and that's a good thing."
1,NOT safe!!,"I just had our car seat professionally installed at our local police station, and I was told that these headrests are a hazard. The padding that rests between the baby and the seat prevents the seatbelts from being properly secured (extra wiggle room is lethal in a crash). A couple of rolled up recieving blankets will stablize the head just as well and doesn't interfere with the seatbelts."
2,False Advertising,"This book is written well enough and it's interesting enough, it's just not what the cover says it will be. It's not about Tolkien's and Lewis' relationship. It's a side by side mini-biography of both them, but there's very little about their actual friendship. I've read bios of both of them and I was really excited to focus on their relationship, but this book doesn't do it. I feel cheated."
2,"Ineffective, greasy but fragrant",A lay person has no ability to evaluate the amount or quality of ingredients in a product. My lay person estimation of the amount of calendula in this cream has to be skimpy. Calendula is a known itch killer yet this product produced not relief for psoriasis in terms of itch relief or reducing redness.The product leaves a greasy coating on the skin which transfers to clothing or bedding. It doesn't seem to absorb into the skin as other creams do. The jar now gathers dust as it provided no benefit or relief for me beyond a gentle pleasant scent.
2,"Helpful, but...","This book is full of useful advice, but do not mistake it for instruction on how to become a gentleman. Despite what one would think, I have come to appreciate this term ""Metrosexual"" as it distinguishes those who use manners and the appearance of urbane sophistication for their own self-advancement from true gentlemen. True gentlemen show respect for themselves and others, bringing the light of civilization to a darkening world, and leaving society better for their efforts. A gentleman's manners, urbanity and consideration are a lifestyle, not a mask that is donned for selfish convenience.Thus, if one is seeking to become a metrosexual, this book fits the bill. If one wants to be a gentleman, keep shopping."
4,I liked it,"I grew up lower middle class without a father. I am 25 and have worked hard to become somewhat successful in my practice. I spend atleast ten bucks on lunch everyday. If this book makes you twenty dollars(or better yet gets you laid), due to some confidence you got from this reading, you just got 100% return (or more) on your investment. Take it for what it is...an introduction to style."
5,Know someone with no style?,Loved this book. Very funny. Bought it for my brother in law. He wears the worst clothes. No style and no taste. Easy book to follow. Hopefully he will throw away his tassled loafers now!
1,I cant belive you people dont know this.,"I cant believe you people think this is the best thing since sliced bread. I grew up in europe and was tought most of these thing at the ripe age of oh...12. No one should have to read this and say they know every thing about art, food, proper etiquete...ect Americans really are uneducated hicks......Im just happy I chose CanadaNever the sell read it, so you could at least atemp to have an inteligent conversation."
2,Cashing in on a buzz-word,"For years, people have been writing manuals on male etiquette, and this one is no different. Think of it as no more than a slightly updated version of another etiquette book. On principle, however, buy something else (like ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy: The Fab 5's Guide to Looking Better . . ."") that isn't veiling 'basic etiquette' with a term that is intended to cash in on a reader's desire to feel cosmopolitan.It has useful information, but no more than any other etiquette books, and certainly isn't as comprehensive as others (such as the ""How to Be a Gentleman"" series).You'd be better off with something else."
4,Functional Mug,"I was looking for a simple travel mug, no logo, football or promotional ads on the outside. And something big enough to last during the drive to work. This mug is stainless, insulated, and does a good job of keeping the coffee hot. I'm not sure if it's dishwasher safe, but due to the rubber seal, it's not a good idea to put it in the dishwasher. Consequently, no matter how good you wash it by hand, once it's used for coffee, the coffee odor seems to stay with the mug. I tried using it for water after using it for coffee and the coffee aftertaste was apparent so we just use it now for coffee, not tea or water. When you put the lid on the mug, it doesn't seem to seal securely but it did not leak at all. The ad for the mug, and the sticker on the outside both say this mug is 14 fl. oz. but the sticker on the bottom says the mug is actually 10.7 oz. This is an acceptable mug for the price."
3,An O.K. game...,"At first I was very excited about Splinter cell. It started out as usual with movement trainning and off we go with a lot of expectations. I think that's what got me... Too much expectation and I have played games like this before...Despite of all the reviews and good ratings, I found this game boring after 4 hours of game play. It was repetitive and AI's of enemy wasn't so intelligent as I hope to be. There wasn't much of action either. I was thinking about giving two stars but because of the quality of the game I gave 3."
2,"Eh, I've seen better","Before actually playing it, I was planning on buying it anyways, because of all the good reviews it had gotten, but thank God I played it at a store because it really didn't please me at all. In the stealth-action genre, no game, and I mean no game at all, can even come remotely close to the entertainment that the Metal Gear Solid series provides. The gameplay in Splinter Cell is quite unique, but there are weird things that you have to do like when you pick locks, you may be stumped, sitting there for 30 minutes trying to figure out how to pick the thing.To say I've seen better does not do my feelings justice. In fact, I think that I'll go dig out my copy of Metal Gear Solid (the first one!)"
3,"Good game, but NOTHING touches Solid Snake","This is a great game but I have to go against what everyone is saying about it. This game does not even compare to the Metal Gear Solid series. Metal Gear Solid 2 has a much better storyline and characters. Sorry Sam, but Solid Snake owns you any day."
3,"Okay, but thats about it.","This game is okay and it definitly don't live up to it's hype. The game has some cool features like lighting and shawdowing. It's just that the game pales in comoparesion to Metal Gear Solid 2. The elimition of a radar leads you to spend half-an-hour to find which door to go though. Plus dare I say it, the AI is too smart. There could be one guy that always hears you so you find yourself pulling out your hair, how do I get past this guy? The stealth is amazing though it's just that thy left out to many things. Tom Clancy series pride themselves on being realistic. When it's takes you 3 shots in the head mind you to kill someone it is a tad annoying. In other words you will find yourself crying with fustration and bordem while playing this game. First of all is you want a steath game then get MGS2. If you say to yourself I have to have this game I strongly I repete strongly recomend renting."
3,Super Great Game,This game is a great stealth game and it is as good as Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons Of Liberty! It has just the same amount of staelth and actions with MGS2 Sons Of Liberty! This really is a great game!
5,Great Girl-Group Sound!,"The Chiffons embody the simple yet yearning quality of the 60's girl groups. Their harmony and catchy riffs make this an all-out pleasure to listen to and enjoy. Especially fine is the little-heard ""I Have a Boyfriend"" which is representative of the early 60's scene. This is a must-have CD."
2,Dispensible,This '60s blues summit was a chaotic disappointment. It's interesting as blues history more than as blues music (the female chorus is particularly annoying). Look for some prime Muddy and Wolf instead.
3,I wouldnt buy again...,"I gave 3 stars taking into account the price of this phone. otherwise i would give 1 or 2 stars only.PROS----1) cheapest phone as far as price is concerned2) comes with a bunch of features like callerID, callwaiting ID, Answering system. these days everybody wants to have features like these. this is one of the most inexpensive phones with so many featuresCONS----1) i had 2 uniden phones (different models) and both of them died exactly after one year.and one phone didnt work even after replacing the battery.2) buttons become very difficult to push after a while3) sound is not very clear4) as a next option, dont go for 2.4ghz as it always had problems of static and interference with microwave, wireless networking,etc5) customer service is not good. they dont care if u explain ur problem"
3,"It appears designed well enough for use, but....","I bought this for my 2003 Z4. The Amazon parts vehicle fit application said it will fit my car. I was very disappointed it didn't fit. Either they sent the wrong parts or the application is flawed. Returning the parts was very easy and was credited immediately by Amazon, but I would rather have had a fitting part. I also bought rear shocks for the same vehicle from Amazon, and the fit was incorrect. I am beginning to not trust their fit application software.I rated it only three stars because I really couldn't tell if the product was up to the task. It was well packaged and seemed like a robust enough strut to handle the job.I was forced to use a brick-n-mortar vendor at twice the price to finish the job. I am not please about that at all."
3,Did not come with a Heaven Coin,"Thought the dub was good, not great. But, it held its own.3 stars because my Limited Edition did NOT come with a heaven coin."
3,Not quite duplicate,"If like me you are in a town that has no duplicate tournaments, and friends just play bridge on their PC's, you might feel cutoff from real tournament play. This book by no means replaces the experience, but at least it has feedback from the author as to the hands and suggested play. And, unlike computers, you can take out a pen and sketch out the planned play."
4,A must have for Architects & Designers.,I use this book everyday for insight into the architecture of northern Italian homes and farm houses. For design ideas as well as historical backgrounds.
3,CIRCLE OF FIRE,"Do you know what it would be like to be a KKK member you dont want to know. The phsical descriptions and personality traits of the main character were worry and scared for his father. The setting took place in North Carolina in Tidawater, Christmas 1936. The plot of the book in the beginning was that Harrison and has friends had to gather black walnuts from the forest and then there mom told them to get in there house and they ran away to there tree house. In the middle of the book Harrison and his two friends were in the forest and they wanted to know what it was so they saw the KKK burning a cross ans satisying a person.In the end of the book Harrison never wanted to be a KKK person or kill anyone. The conflict in the story was that Harrison was a KKK member. The characters resolves this conflict by violents, illuminating, and ultimate satisfying"
2,NO CLOSED CAPTIONS,"ALTHOUGH THE JACKET INDICATED THIS FILM IS PRODUCED WITH CLOSED CAPTIONS, THERE WERE NONE. wE MISSED A LOT OF THE SPOKEN WORDS"
3,"Fun Sequel to, ""Tony Rome""","If you're a fan of Frank Sinatra as an actor, and if you found, ""Tony Rome"" to be a good classic private eye tale, you will thoroughly enjoy, ""Lady in Cement."" Ol' Blue Eyes is on a new case as Tony, a former Miami detective scraping a living as a private detective who can't afford to be too selective when it comes to clientele. Of course, this gets him mixed up in some complicated situations with shady characters, lovely mystery - women, and deadly mobsters. The script bounces along nicely with crisp dialogue and sharp acting throughout, and Frank is at his best delivering witty one - liners with a world weary cynicism. Sinatra's middle years produced some of his finest acting, and he breezes through this film as if he were made for the role. A supporting cast including Raquel Welch, Dan Blocker and Richard Conte nicely compliments Sinatra's boozing, gambling, but always reliable Tony. This is a necessary addition to any private eye DVD collection."
4,Lady in Cement DVD,"Frank Sinatra's second movie as detective Tony Rome. A typical 60's detective movie, with all the gender cliché's, etc., of the period. It is probably only interesting to those of us who were born in 1950 or earlier and remember who Frank Sinatra was.The disc has good quality picture and sound."
4,GOOD GAME BUT!,"Splinter cell is a great game, but! i hate stealth games plain and simple, i started loving this game then after a couple stages, i just got tired of doing the same old sneeking stuff, i loved Metal Gear 2 but this is not my pot of soup well later folks."
4,almost as good as metal gear,Boy i tell you don't listen that kid who gave this game a one star this game is great the only bad thing is there's no blood it would be cool if their was blood like in mgs2 and the graphics aren't as good as mgs2 but boy i rarly spend over an hour playing games but this i spent about 2 hours one while renting it and now gamecube owners and ps2 owners can enjoy this wonderful game. Rent it first because i had for three days so far and i'm almost halfway through the game and i plan to beat it.
3,Works Fine,"Like almost all chargers, this works fine. Nothing special, just works for the past year we have had 2."
3,'ehhhhh,"Well, I'm not sure about this one. I liked the first one on the PS1, so I figured I'd like this one. Well, I do but I don't. The breeding is pretty cool. Buy two horses and mate them, soon after, you'll have a new one with a combo stats of the parents. Very cool. But the controls! Ugh. I do not like them. I don't like the view, I don't like the way things blur instead of letting the hardware show off the horse pulling ahead, I just don't know about this game. I'm a fan of horse racing. I don't even want to start on Navigator Cindy. She's cute and all, but she needs to get a job somewhere else.It's a good simulator, just not a great one. Feels thrown together to me, without much thought into a strategy."
4,Enlightenment,"I thought this was a very good read and it surely opens up your eyes to people suffering from this terrible disease...they are amazing and courageous, and I give them a lot of credit for sharing their stories.I wish them all good luck and good health in the future."
1,Misleading picture,"I was very disappointed when my friend opened this on Christmas as it is only butterflies, no dragonflies as pictured both on the listing and also the picture on the box. I bought this because dragonflies hold a special significance for my friend, so basically it ruined the gift I intended. I chose the purple item when I ordered due to the dragonflies pictured. Be aware that if you purchase this you may not get what you see."
2,Makes my silhouette WORSE,"I bought this after I had a baby because I'd lost the weight, but wanted something to flatten the looser skin around my lower stomach. This fits me properly but the top squeezes me in a very unflattering way. Eh, oh well. Maybe it's intended for something else. FYI, I'm about 5'5"" and 120 pounds."
5,Best yet panty from Amazon!,I have worn this particular panty for years. I like the way it fits like skin and I like the way it feels. I recommend it to all my friends!
5,Oxygen Sensor,This oxygen sensor arrived in a few days and was well made and fit my car perfectly. Saved me $100.
2,John Denver but re-releases of the same set of songs is madding.,"This 2 CD set offers 21 tracks of John's material, never released from RCA as a set or a greatest hits collection. Watch out.Disc 11997 CD Delta Distribution 129231997 CD Laserlight 12923 Take Me Home, Country Roads1997 CS Delta Distribution 729232002 CD Delta Distribution 630312004 CD Delta Distribution 38110 [John Denver, Homegrown]Disc 21996 CD Delta Distribution 129241997 CD Laserlight 12924 [Annie's Song]2004 CD RCA/BMG Heritage 828766519222004 CD Delta Distribution 38110 [John Denver, Homegrown]2005 CD Windstar [The John Denver Collection, Vol. 2: Annie's Song]"
2,Disappointed,"JDeveloper 10g comes with its new ADF architecture to help developers streamline the building of J2EE applications as well as the integration of the Struts framework. In my mind this is the heart and sole of 10g. However, this book hardly talks about it at all. What little it did mention about ADF appeared to be nothing more than copied and pasted material from the help system. For other aspects of JDeveloper, I suppose it's a fair introduction. However, the online help system could probably do as much good."
5,An interesting and example oriented guide to JDeveloper 10g,I had quite a few prejudiced notions about using IDEs like JDeveloper. I worked on JDeveloper using this book and found it to be most interesting! The book has explained things with great lucidity.I must say that I have come to agree that JDeveloper does make a difference in the way you design and develop Java and J2EE applications. This book helped me see the many features and benefits of JDeveloepr 10g and change my attitude!
4,Very Nice,This is another very nice british mystery series. Good modern stories. I'd buy it again. I have the first three seasons and I plan on buying the fourth. This is the same actor that was in The Darling Buds of May.
2,FROST SERIES 1,"i have already reviewed this but just incase the fiollowing applies.The first disc was very poor quality and it froze then jammed the DVD maxhine for about 3 minutes.the second discs kept jumping. The quality was a little better but not good. This was a used disc, I have one episoe on Disc 2 to view, it makes me jubious about buying used products, but maybe I was unlucky. The poor quality distracted from what is a good series."
4,Good product.,This lets you put four different ports or connectors in an area the size of a standard outlet. It is very slick.
5,Justice in the Edwardian period,I purchased this book for a Readers Guild discussion group at Goucher College. We've also read Flaubert's Parrot and Metroland but Arthur and George is my favorite. It's an interesting study of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's time and family dealing with long standing racial tensions and circumstantial evidence in a search to establish truth.
1,Sadly disappointing,"Julian Barnes is a wonderful writer but, sadly, this novel does not use his gifts to his advantage. Had it been by another author, I'd have put it down for good about a third of the way through. It was only my previous experience w/ Barnes's work that kept me plowing ahead.The plotline has been recited in many other reviews; suffice it to say that Barnes did a lot of research -- probably too much for him to turn away from this work in midstream, which he should have. The novel is disjointed, too long, plodding, and lacking in a satisfying ending. Rather than ""Arthur and George,"" read something else by Barnes."
4,"Not compatable with 310,315, 320","The technical information for the product is misleading. The product is for the meridian model only. It is not compatible with the 310, 315, and 320. I still gave it a star rating based on it's use for a Meridian model. I had to send the product back and order direct from Vann's. They had the correct model for the 315."
3,"Levy's Leathers Leather Mandolin Strap,Burgundy","It is functional, but too thin because of this there is too much pressure in one spot."
2,Smell changes from great to horrid,"At first, it's a beautiful floral scent, then it dries to something that gives me a headache. I cannot detect what smell it is, but it's not pleasant. I cannot detect vanilla in this at all."
1,NO REFUNDS AFTER 30 DAYS - LET THE BUYER BEWARE,"The body magic costs a small fortune for all the claims Ardyss makes but in actual fact the product does not really survive longer than about 30 continuous use. Mine fell apart (the boning came out) just over a month after I purchased it (not from Amamzon seller). I called the Ardyss freefone line and they told me that they do not refund after 30 days. Considering the average cost is in excess o 80, I can help but feel like I have been fleeced. I spent 250 purchasing for myslef and gifting others. It is a hell of a lot of money to spend only to be told that they will not honour responsibility for what looks like a manufacturing fault. What does anyone else think?"
1,What a HOT MESS!,I am not happy with this cheesy so called ardyss body magic! I have the real one and not sure what this is. It is flimsy and light weight. I am not happy at all. What a waste of 150.00 dollars. Can I get a refund or half back?
1,Doesn't really work,"I would not recommend this product. I could not get the refuse bag to stay on the unit securely and when I turn the garden hose on, the effect is to shoot a stream of water through the refuse bag, blasting away anything you might collect. You also need quite a bit of water pressure to get some worthwhile suction."
5,Outstanding Video Series,I really enjoyed this series! Lots of action and excellent character development. It's heavily layered with Australian actors and I enjoy seeing the mix of fresh faces to the screen.The premise of a rouge US President causing a nuclear exchange while a US sub commander questions his oddly routed instructions to fire is an interesting twist. The questioning of orders gets the captain called a traitor and brings his sub under fire from other US forces. Hence a cat and mouse game of survival between the US sub commander and opposing US political/military forces. The high-stakes are increased by Russian and Chinese involvement.I like this series. I hope it continues for several more seasons.
5,Excellent Show,Very good Show about the Navy and a rogue submarine captain and crew. Navy Seals and a tropical island taken over!!
2,Beautiful Location,"But the show is just so predictable and the characters rather boring. I really wanted to like it if for nothing other than the amazing location, but I just couldn't."
5,great show ...,"I have not finished the whole season yet (only the first 4 episodes), but they are intelligent, and fast moving. My neighbor recommended this series to me, and my cable on-demand feature did not have the first 3 episodes, so I bought them through Amazon, and am now continuing them through on-demand. Very good show."
4,Last Resort gets you thinking,"This show delves into relationships, trust and testing of everything you think may or not be right and what you will do if you had to. I really like this show."
5,They should find a way for a second season for the show on another network because I think ABC made a mistake in scheduling it,"Because this is a great show and story line that this show presented with suspense, a lot of thrilling situations"
3,OF COURSE,"Jessica's good at track. So what else is new? In Sweet Valley Twins, she was good at basketball; no one could win without her. She was great at cheerleading and gymnastics; she was going to the California Games! So it's no wonder why she's suddenly the best after Bethel. She must really be a supertalented jock! NOT!!"
3,Triple feature,I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed all 3 movies The boneyard was a little amature but still worth it if you can handle the real crime videos
3,Six Degrees of Helter Skelter-mab,Each story was pretty good... each had info i hadn't heard before... good footage... pretty comprehensive. The movie about Ted Bundy was done pretty well.
2,missing parts,"I have purchased these filter in the past from Amazon without problems, but this time I ordered 3 filters and when they came they did not have all the pieces as in the picture. I returned them to Amazon without any problems and they sent 3 replacements...same problem. Amazon looked into the problem and said they would not be able to send more as they needed to look into the problem. I was given a refund in no time...but I am still w/out filters. I hope Amazon can rectify the problem soon."
1,I cant use it yet,"I didn't get all the parts neccesary to use this product, sorry can't help you yet"
1,"If you have a 17"" XPS laptop...",Don't waist your time. This won't fit the XPS Gen 2 laptop... bought it and return it same day...
1,The dimensions are not correct!,"Three problems:1) ZERO padding or protection on all four edges. Underwear literally provides more protection than the translucent nylon fabric.2) The corners are sewn in a radius, so the dimensions are not correct. They are sewn on about a 1-1/2"" radius, so your laptop must be at least 1"" narrower and shorter than the listed dimensions if you want it to zip close (that's what the zipper is for).3) The metal logo has sharp prongs that go through the neoprene to the inside of the bag.In short, the edges, corners, and top of my laptop will not be protected by using this product. I would have a neat cushion to sit on if it didn't have the stupid metal Bodyglove logo."
1,Didn't fit,"My laptop is a Sony Vaio 15.4"" and this sleeve didn't fit it wide wise ... lenght wise was okay. I was very disappointed. I thought on returning it, however, I really needed one for my trip two days later so I went to Best Buy and found one that fitted it perfectly for the same price and this one was even better - with handles included. So instead of returning it I will give it to a friend who has a 13"" Mac laptop."
5,Brilliant,"The Lion King on broadway is by far the best most amzing show ever created. Whats so amazing is that the book is as good as the musical. Without Julie Taymor the lion king would not be such a huge success as it is and you find all about this in the book. Some of the pictures of the show itself and the costumes are just wonderful which makes the presentation of the book even more wonderful. I dont even read books but am findin it very hard to put this down and read it over and over again. If you require any info, or are just curious email me simba262626@yahoo.com to discuss this amazing book."
1,Ridiculous and absurd bibliolatry,"I'll be sincere.I didn't read all this trash-book.Someone lent this trash-book to me, some years ago, here in Brazil.This book is so bad, that I didn't finished it.In fact, I read less than 10% of this biblical-garbage.This was a best-seller some years ago, in many parts of the world, including Brazil and USA.Today the best seller is Da Vinci Code.A trash-book so absurd, as this trash-book.Every time has its own trash-best-seller.About a century ago eugenics was fashion.Later came communism, fascism, nazism, ufologism, etc.This bibliolatry is a good book only for morons or atheists.If you are an atheist, this trash-book is a good way to debunk the bible."
3,Excellent to the last few chapters.........,"I have done a great deal of research on this fascinating and convincable subject but I feel this paticular book was written hastily to be one of the first marketed and that the writer, though convinced of the bible codes validity, proves to be having a bit of trouble excepting the reality, in the last few chapters. His assumptions and opinions can wrongly influence readers into believing that whatever is in the codes is meaningless because ""perhaps God changes His mind"" even though it is recorded in His word, in codes, much less!"
1,PROPHET FOR PROFIT.,"It always amazes me what legnths people will go to avoid the truth. If the author/investigative reporter applied the same energy sans the mathematic mumbo-jumbo examining the claims of the Bible and Jesus Christ, I think he would find more astonishing results than the mysterious code.There are many scriptures that predict with 100% accuracy the time, date of the arrival of the Lord and exactly what happened at His crucifiction between 500 to 700 years before the event! (Read the Psalm 22, Psalm of the cross). There are literally hundreds of these throughout the Bible. It has been my understanding that a (Biblical) Prophet is considered a Prophet if he/she is 100% accurate 100% of the time.I wonder if you applied a similar software model to the dictionary would achieve similar results? WHEN GOD REVEALS HIMSELF, TRUST ME YOU WILL KNOW IT!!"
1,"Horrible, Horrible Book.","Not only is the book badly written and presented, but it's basic premise is wrong. Codes can be found anywhere because humans often classify coincidences as MEANINGFUL"
1,I can't belive this is a serious book,You dont have to be a math genius o hebrew scholar to realize that this is a awful piece of pseudo-science. The author play with his own vague rules and with such unlimited playing field he can find whatever he wants. No more predictive value than any book on Nostradamus.
3,interesting reading,I am roman catholic and read the bible and have been thrilled by the content of this book which looks like scrabble. I do not read hebrew nor do I have the original hebrew version but have checked the statements in the Spanish and English catolic version and the information quoted is correct. I am looking for the continuation of this book since the facts stated date back to 1996 and 1997. Interesting reading.
1,What a bunch of CRAP!!!,"For further information on my review, please refer to the summary. Aside from the fact that the author doesn't have a logical leg to stand on, it proves nothing and is poorly written taboot. If there was something lower than one star this steaming pile of wood pulp would recieve it and shortly after be relocated to the bathroom, where it would serve a higher purpose. Man, oh man, anybody can get published these days."
2,Unbiased Review,"I dont take neither stance on Religion nor Science with these comments.I have read the book and I have to admit that it was marketed and was presented brilliantly. It has one goal... Sell, sell, sell.If you are after useful, quality, informative, knowledge to gain... well you wont find it here. Im so shocked to even see that when you check the back cover of the book it actually says ""non-fiction"".The author is a talented story teller...... add a few statistics here and there, a dash of scientific key figures, mix it with life's controversial unsolved mysteries, a few more dash of historic events and famous people, add and link a few references here and there, and WALA!!!! you have a best seller.Isnt that ironic! it is a ""New York Times number 1 best seller""It was an interesting read though."
3,Weak book about a fascinating subject...,Drosnin's book took a fascinating subject and turned it into a load of mainstream-pap of the sort you'd expect to see in the supermarket tabloids. I found myself quickly wanting more and sorely missed the depth the subject demanded. I found it to be self-serving above all and relatively useless as a research tool. This book is fit only as an introduction to the Torah codes and little else.
1,Poorly Written,"First, let me start by saying that the topic of this book is amazing. My problem is with the writer. The book is extremely repetitous and that leads to boredom. I think in the hands of a more skillful writer, someone with a little flair for language, this could have been a wonderful book. I felt like the writer was trying to convince himself that he believed in the code, and in the process droned on incessantly. While I am fasciated by the theory of a code in the Bible, the writing is simplistic and boring. Reads worse than a textbook."
1,PUUUUUUULLLEEEEEZZZZE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"A fraud, a joke or greed to make some cash off naive and easily suckered people?Answer:ALL of the above.That this thing could even get published is a testament to religion as a business and the publishing business as something beneath a street whore(there are some things even whores won't do to make money).This cynical book deserves to be burned(...)"
5,A Must Read,"I probably sound like somebody who helped make the book, but it is a very good book. Anybody who believes in G-d has to read the book. This book details how the Torah predicts what will happen in our past, and in the future. It predicts Rabin's assasination, who dunnit, and a possible war, with Israel involved after Rabin's assasination, up to the year 2000. (5760). It predicts the Oklahoma City bombing, Watergate, and much more. You must read this book, but only if you believe in a supernatural power. I guess I am one of those people."
1,Oh please.. don't be so gullible people..,"Its really easy to find hidden messages in damn near -any- text, especially if you know what you're looking for. If i wanted to find a prediction about World War 2 in a transcript of Dumb and Dumber, i probably could. As for the predictions about Nuclear war? Isn't that one of the biggest concerns of most people about the future? Finding a nice little ""prediction"" about it isn't difficult."
5,Established Truth!,The book is an easy read despite its documentary nature! There is a great review for the source of this book found at www.jvim.com in the August Intelligence Briefing
1,Tricks with Random Patterns,"This book is the topic of many jokes among scientists and statisticians (many of whom are Christian). It is based on the fact that scanning (especially with a computer) many items (in this case letters and words), one can always come up with patterns and other things in the data that are really just random. It is especially applicable when looking backwards as this book does. A recent astute reviewer points this out. The book preys on ignorance. Don't be sucked in by this completly uncredible nonsense."
1,Great entertainment for the credulous herd,"It doesn't take a Phd mathematician such as Brendan Mckay to notice the huge flaws in Drosnin's thesis (most of which he cynically neglects to mention never mind discuss). This sensationalistic, tabloid-esque drivel is a rubbish book for both science (which it is NOT) and philosophy. Just because Michael Drosnin has managed to find (using no firm rules whatsoever) LIBYA, ARTILLERYMEN and HOLOCAUST in the same 'area' in the Bible does not mean that Libya will attack Israel!!"
1,Irrational Prattle,"""The Bible Code"" aims its gun at the ignorant, looking to shoot down common sense by confusing the reader with mathematical mojo.What Michael Drosnin has concocted is something to tease those who would rather read about the Bible than the Bible itself to believe that Scripture, with the help of math and a sophisticated algorhythm functioned on a computer, is effectively a Nostredomus-like prophet.I do not recommend ""The Bible Code,"" because it is more fanciful than fact.Anthony Trendl"
2,Second one just quit working,"This thing works well until a bulb blows out. When I replace the bulb, it will not turn off after 4 minutes and I end up having to replace it."
1,It simply stopped working . . .,. . .after about a week. I was thrilled when I got it as it appeared to do all it promised. Then it stopped.
1,Works from one foot away! Not worth anything to me.,"I thought, 'what a great idea!' and I'm sure it is under certain situations, but in my closet, nah, didn't work at all. I had to reach up and wave my hand back and forth for it to 'detect' motion, worthless."
1,Just stopped working,"I purchased the item for a closet. I installed and it worked fine for 30 days (return window) then it just stopped working. Stays on all the time. I can't return it so now I have a light socket in a light socket that is redundant that cost me almost $25 and it doesn't work. Piece of junk. I didn't keep the packaging once I had determined that it worked as advertised. It seems like a simple mechanism. So, if you disregard the warning, at least keep the packaging so you can return it to First Alert at your expense."
1,Can't use it,"I had wanted something that would turn the outside floodlight on when someone came up the driveway. I thought putting this into the existing socket would solve the problem. Yet, when I received the item, it specifies only indoor use. If they put it in the product description (not sure they did), I did not see it when I ordered. I have no place inside my house where I can use this product, or where I would want to put it up. So once again, I've bought something for too much money that will end up in a garage sale, unused."
4,Great with an exception!,"This product does the job, however, the light must be at a level that is low enough to catch movement. I wanted it at my doorway, however, the light is located higher than 5' so it did not work. First Alert PIR720RN Motion Sensing Light Socket"
2,Size too large for an ordinary lamp!,"This motion sensing light socket would need a HUGE lamp and shade to look the proper proportion. Might as well just get a motion sensing light, instead of trying to have a regular lamp do the job."
5,Great little motion sensor.,This is a great little motion sensing light socket. I have three of them in my basement so that I don't have to fumble around in the dark looking for the switch. Love it!
3,motion sensor,The area that motion is detected is not as good as advertised. I have to wave an arm to activate the light. Perhaps mounting the light on a wall might have worked better.
2,First Alert not so alert.,Great when it works.Doesn't always come on on when I enter the room. Probably would not buy this product again.
3,luck of the draw,ordered 2 units - one worked the other did not. have since ordered two more. still problems with the unit coming on when there is motion. too bad. when it works it is great !
4,Illuminate!,"Easy to install and works like a charm. Range is pretty short, which is why I won't give it 5 stars. 12 feet is really stretching it but don't expect it to pick up any movement further than that."
1,Worked for 1 day,"It worked for 1 day.The light stayed on and doesn't turn off.Threw out the box, and now I cannot get a refund."
1,Doesnt work,Light were turning on and never shut off .I wanted to use it for the garage as i have a frig there and i am to lazy to turn on the light ...but this guy is FAIL
2,"Not good for closets, old obsolete incandescent bulbs only","Not good for closets, this device will use old obsolete incandescent bulbs only. I bought two of these to try. By the time they light up, you will have gotten what you needed and closed the door again. They won't work outdoors because they're not designed for that, either. So just what are these good for? Perhaps for a large empty room lit by a single incandescent light bulb? If you put any furniture in the dark empty room you'll be doing Dick Van Dyke impersonations every time you walk through. It is a shame but this thing is pretty much useless. Sorry."
3,Just what I was looking for,I put this in a closet with an overhead fluorescent light and it works great. I've had no problem with the fluorescent light that was in there (I'm using a DuraBright).Update: it doesn't work so well anymore; I have not tried to debug it: maybe it doesn't like the new LED light or maybe it's a connector issue.
4,Great Find,"I had seen this product selling for $40 in a catalog that I get and thought it was just too expensive. I bought it here for much, much less. I installed it in my glassed in porch and really like it. No more coming in to total darkness, with the light switch inside! The only thing that would make this better is if it also had a light sensor so it only came on when it is dark. Until I can find that product, this is the best!"
1,POOR product,"This product didn't work right from the beginning. It flickered, even with the change of watts and then soon after installing and manually turning the lightswitch on and off, it repeatedly burnt out bulbs. NOT at all happy with this product. Yes a great idea and concept if it worked properly."
1,Nice if it worked.,I bought two of these. They worked great for a few months and then both stopped working for no apparent reason. Too bad because they were very convenient and helped put an end to people leaving the lights on when not needed.
2,Works for only 2 days.,"Ordered the item from Home and Beyond through amazon.com. Only worked with incandescent bulb. Might work with fluorescent bulb greater than 25W, but could not try because it broke after two days. Sent two RMA requests, did not receive any response from Home and Beyond."
1,Never Received the Book,I did not receive the book. I leave for China in one week and will not be able to prepare for the trip as I had planned.
4,DK Now I'm Reading,"I purchased this for a mentally challenged relative. She is finding it hard, but challenging. Her biggest wish in life is to be able to read. I am grateful there are products out there to help her like this."
2,Amores Perros,"I'm not sure of what I was expecting, but the movie was ok. It was in Spanish with English sub titles. I missed some of the movie because I was reading the sub titles. It would have been nice if you had a choice to hear it in English. The movie was a little hard for me to follow."
5,Excellente!,"Hats off to all of the Mexican directors. You have done very well so far. Mexican cinema doesn't seem to be doomed to the fate of many other countries where all the films are boring and cliched.Amores Perros is a highly original film that takes on the ambitious task of connecting three plotlines. It actually does a pretty good job even if there are a few holes. However, everything else is so good that the flaws are almost unnoticeable."
4,Not a date movie but well worth seeing....,"This is a movie where the dogs deserve more sympathy than the people. Each of the characters is wallowing in their own troubles so much that they don't see the troubles they cause for themselves.That being said, did I enjoy it? Yes absolutely. While the images are extremely graphic, the stories make it worthwhile.Also as a side note, this DVD has several extras (featurettes, music videos, etc.)"
1,Violent and sad,I liked the acting but this was very violent and tough. I can't recommend it to people.
1,So what?,"This may be ""how Mexico really is,"" but its not a good movie. After reading all the great reviews I was expecting much more. But like 21 Grams, it is just a movie about people you don't really care about because you don't get to know them well enough. You feel like a voyeur on other people's miserable lives and you never get inside their heads enough to really care. Its like watching a sit com, just splashed all over a big screen. There is too much violence without a point. The acting is good but the stories are blah, especially the middle one, and the themes are not developed very well. Its too much ""film-making"" without anough story. The style doesn't hook into the story and there is very little emotion generated. I simply didn't care, and I would never want to see it again.Y tu mama tambien is much, much better."
2,Not for me!,"Ugh. Guess I hadn't read enough about this movie. It's definitely not for me. In fact I walked out after 30 minutes. If you like dogs and babies and don't really enjoy watching bad things happen to them, you might not like this either. I do think it was well done, and it's very intense -- just not for me."
3,Entertaining but not quite up to par,"I bought the audio version as a two pack with Full Bloom. I really loved the comedy and romance in Full Bloom, but this book didn't quite translate as well as an audio version. It was still entertaining on a long car ride, but honestly I just wanted it to be over so I can move onto another book."
2,Don't expect Stephanie Plum,"If you read this expecting the humor and fast pace of a Stephanie Plum novel, you'll be disappointed. It doesn't seem like JE did any more than wave a magic wand over these books."
3,Fun,"This was a cute book, easy to read... I read the entire thing in one afternoon. I couldn't help but think, ""boy I should have written this book"" being our experiences are very much the same.Overall, it is a great book for a boost in positve thinking which was much needed after study up on infertility for months and months."
2,"usb ports are faulty, and issue with screen resolution detection","Like others, I too experienced the USB ports going bad after a few months. The unit isn't very useful if I have to switch the keyboard/mouse dongle from machine to machine, rather than use the KVM switch, but that's my temporary workaround until I find a better KVM switch. Another issue is the screen resolution on the shared monitor gets messed up when switching between the 2 machines, I'd say about 10% of the time. I would have to switch back and forth a few times until it fixed itself."
1,Piece of Junk,"The switch was shipped with a defective cable. When I called Tech Support ( I prefer Tech Support in the USA TrendNet does not) I had trouble understanding the gentlemen's English which made the call twice as long. He refused to send me a replacement cable or to connect me to a supervisor. He suggested I contact Amazon. I did, for a refund. In the future I will not purchase TrendNet products."
1,"usb functionality flaky at first, completely broken after ~6 months","Monitor switching works fine, but keyboard/mouse started out flaky and degraded over time. Six months after purchase, stopped working completely.Also, audio has a lot of static when pumped through this.Poor quality, though I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Not friendly if using XP on one computer and Window 7 on the other,I purchased this to be able to have a personnal computer and a work computer. I have XP on the work computer. When I loaded Window 7 to the other computer I loss usage of the mouse and keyboard thru this box. Everything else works fine. So what I did to work around this problem is to use separate mouse and keyboard on each box.Before I upgraded one computer to window 7 and actually had XP on both it worked fine. I really loved it.If you can work around this problem like I did then it work fine.
5,Love it,This KVM does just what I want and does it very well. It is not large and very easy to setup and use.
4,Two for the space of one,"Previously, I had a 2-port PS2 KVM setup with 2 PS2 computers.. When I bought my new Windows 7 computer, it had only USB ports & lacked the PS2 ports. I tried using PS2 to USB converters by they failed to work properly. So I decided to go with this unit, since it had the additional audio switching capablity that my old unit lacked. At first it seemed to fail to switch properly, but once each machine 'learned' on it's own to handle this switch, it works fine, albeit with a several second delay when switching between machines..Really like the audio switching capability.."
2,Not a great device,"Device does not reliably switch between computers, which requires a reset of a computer occassionally.When one of the computers is running Linux, the scroll lock key does not work, I must use the Num Lock key several times.I had an I/O gear before...much better."
2,Anything but Automatic switching!,"This switch is unable to handle the USB keyboard switching at all. When turning on either of the two computers, the USB keyboard codes are scrambled. The only way I've found to resolve this is to unplug the keyboard from the TK-209, wait about 10 seconds, and then re-insert the keyboard's USB connector into the TK-209. That works about 80% of the time, but the other 20% requires a 2nd attempt. USB keyboards are cheap, so I gave up and connected a 2nd one, so each computer has it's own dedicated keyboard. I would not have bought this product if I had known such a problem existed."
2,Failed after 6 months,"Worked pretty well until today. The keyboard and mouse interface failed. Keyboard and mouse work when plugged directly into a PC, but no longer via the Trendnet."
1,Flicker City after one month,"Although this was very easy to setup, and everything ""works"" an annoying flicker is produced from monitor. I tried different monitors,different cables, and different Operating Systems to the same result."
1,lousy product,"After 1 week of operation, both USB ports failed...the unit was worthless....had to return it...you get what you pay for...I bought a different (more expensive) brand that works like a charm....do not waste your money on this product"
5,This switch is great,"I have a home computer and a laptop that I use for work and with just a hit of a button I can switch between them using the same mouse, keyboard and monitor. This is wonderful!"
4,TRENDnet TK-209K 2-Port USB KVM Switch Kit,"This is a handy device, works well even with mac os x and windows xp computers together."
3,OK for Winxp But Doesn't Work on an Imac,"I set this up on an old PC and a laptop. It worked OK.Then I decided I would like to use it with my iMac serving the monitor function. (I have a monitor adapter.) Well, I couldn't get the KVM switch to work although it is supposed to work with an iMac. I am running winxp and snow leopard on the imac.So I went to [...]. This version of the KVM switch was not listed on the website. Great. Registered. Tried to fill in a help desk ticket so I could get written instructions on how to do it. However, I could not complete the request for help because the webpage wanted additional personal information, but it would not let me type the information it wanted into the web form. Therefore it would not let me ask for help. Great.I'll have to call tomorrow but this does not bode well for customer support. I am not up to a long phone session tonight.I am fast losing confidence in Trendnet."
1,junk,I have had this about a year. about once a month the mouse and keyboard stop working and i disconnect everything on the switch then they work. I am sick of doing this and today it won't work even though I disconnected then reconnected everything. save your money
5,Great solution!,"Does just what it says it will do. This switch provided the simple solution for sharing screen time with my Dell Mini 10v and Xbox 360 on a single monitor. Cheap, easy, and (so far) reliable."
5,"Great, dead simple KVM Switch","Got my wife a laptop to replace her desktop but I use the desktop to record TV for my travels so I wanted both to exist in the same spot with only one monitor, keyboard and mouse. This worked perfectly. Setup was confusing but actually simple once I realized what went where. What confused me is you only need to connect a VGA cable and one USB to each computer. Previous KVMs I had needed 4 connections with sound. This handles sound, mouse, and keyboard with one USB. No time delay that I notice. . Takes up almost no space and the best part is it can be hidden. I don't need to push the button to switch between computers because it creates a hot key (hit scroll lock twice) to toggle between PCs. Works great. Uses a USB keyboard and mouse and VGA monitor.PROS: Price, ease of setup and use, hotkey,Cons: NONE"
2,You get what you pay for,"Ok, I went for price. I have some other Trendnet stuff and it all seems to work, so I said what the heck and I went for the cheap. The product itself is well done. Plenty of cables etc. Simple software. Limited but understandable documentation. It just doesn't work too well. I have two laptops and two desktops hooked up to it. The one desktop with a real video card works fine, the other desktop using onboard video control from Intel forgets it's settings everytime I shut it off. The laptops, one an Acer mini and the other a new one running Windows 7 also with an Intel video controller, both take about five minutes to reconfigure each time I boot them up. I've downloaded the latest drivers and utilities from Intel and Acer but no joy. I've had a couple of iogear two ports and they both worked great. The worst part is that Trendnet just fobs you off when you ask for help. My advice, spend a little more and go a different route."
5,Great device.,"Works as advertised. I am very pleased to have the capability it provides. With the push of a button, I can switch my monitor and keyboard between two different laptops."
1,avoid it,"so sad, this item worked for a few months, then it stopped working entirely, same problem that many other people have had, so sad"
4,"Dated material, but still essential","I purchased this book many years ago out of a general interest in Japanese history. There were few if any other titles available in English on this subject at that time. I found it gave a great introductory explanation, particularly in the historic background, etiquette and philosophy of kendo. It inspired me to start practicing this martial art. For more specific, practical information I recommend augmenting this title with Ozawa's ""Kendo: the Definitive Guide"" which, while it has a wealth of explanation and diagrams of greater value to a practicing kendoist, is less involved with the history/philosophy embodied in Sasamori and Warner's work. Still ""This Is Kendo"" is really an essential starting point."
4,Great book for Kendo beginners,"All who practise Kendo should have this book. Especially beginners, since it explains the basics of Kendo well.And it's perfect for reference, so even advanced student can use it.The book is quite old, but good anyway."
1,Lacking any real insight,This book is filled with sports analogies which frankly get a little tedious after a while. I found the book content to be no more than basic and would not recommend it.
1,Don't waste your money,"The price is low and so is the quality. I had a 900mhz Uniden for several years that I was happy with. So, I bought this thinking I would like it too. Uniden went cheap on this one. It even feels cheap. The sound quality was bad. It had a popping noise whenever I got a few rooms away from the base. So much for 2.4 GHz clarity. I sent it back to Amazon (who, by the way, was GREAT about taking the return and refunding my money)."
4,Sturdy but too loud to be used cabinet door cushion,"I was looking for bump pads to replace worn out ones for kitchen cabinet doors. My primary concern was the pads worn so thin (or fell out), that cabinet door closing sounded like someone slammed shut the door and was heard throughout the house.The reviews are strong so I bought one. They seem to be made out of rubber and felt sturdy but can give a little. Good depth also for cushioning between the door and the cabinet. After I applied, I closed the door normally and ""BAM""! It's just as loud as without any bump pads! ugh.These are great to replace worn out or missing bumps under small appliances. But if noise matters, it's not a good use for cabinet doors.I won't rate this badly since it is good product, just not a fit for my need."
4,prosiac,"Massive book of prose. Afraid I will never finish this one. I expected poetry not an encyclopedia. Arrived in perfect condition and very quickly, I just didn't like the content. and did not finish."
4,Intellectual and Interesting,"I decided to read this book for my Honors English class in high school. I really most of Emerson's thoughts and ideas presented in his essays. It was, at times, difficult to read because of how drawn out he is, but I found it easier to read once I became more acclimated to his particular style. It will take a lot of time to read, if you decide to read all of it, so don't think that this is a quick read whatsoever. That being said, I enjoyed reading Emerson's works and hope to read more from similar authors in the future."
4,Good quality,"This is a beautiful product. Good quality and a great match with the other Forte pieces. It was just too big for my small bathroom, so I had to return it. :("
3,Too tight for a size 10,"I had to return them. They are a narrow fit. In addition, it is not the same color as shown online. It is more of a shimmery off white and not just off white. Therefore, it was darker than I expected. I love the way the look, but it's just a shame that the size was off."
5,So Easy and Delicious!,"Not only are the recipes in this book great-tasting, they are very easy to make. Living in an apartment with a tiny kitchen, I could never make complex recipes with long lists of ingredients, but this book was perfect. It emphasizes fresh flavors and even though the recipes are very straightforward, I found the dishes to be sophisticated and elegant. Even as a beginner cook, I was making grilled lamb chops with rosemary and glazed salmon steaks at least once a week. You realize that you don't need a gourmet kitchen and lots of equipment to make excellent meals and eat well. I especially liked that her recipes sometimes include the main dish and a vegetable side dish, all made in the grill pan at once, making preparation and clean-up even easier. I bought this book a year ago, and it really inspired me to learn to cook and to expand beyond just the grill pan. I would be interested in other cookbooks by this author as well."
5,Yummmm! :),"This cookbook has some of the most delicious looking dishes in it! Most seem fairly easy to prepare and I am highly looking forward to having time away from traveling to try several of them. If you are buying a grill pan I would very much recommend this book, if not for educational purposes then just for fun!"
1,Too primitive,It's hard to say something new in electronic music. Philipp Quehenberger could not overcome the challenge. May be he had thought of something but this something remained with him. To me it is just a set of boring techo tracks like millions others on the market. Could not remember any of them the day after listening.
2,Incomplete and repetitive,"In this book are copies of the articles that appeared in Road and Track magazine over the years. For some reason some of them are in black and white, the ones that are color are of average print quality. Way too many articles about pre 1992 production/1992-1995 (like more than half the book). I found the information from article to article to be repetitive. Also the coverage seems spotty. It doesn't appear that all of the years are covered. Hard to tell since a lot of articles don't even mention what year they are talking about. Some good issues mentioned, but overall a lot of fluff. For example I don't need to know the tire size in every article. If you are looking for a complete reference forget it. This is the second lousy Viper book I read, I am going to go to the internet for further information."
2,Uniden caller ID cordless answering,"Quality is a disappointment. The clarity on this phone is very good but no where in the tech data did it mention the volume of in/out recorded messages and the ring on the handset cannot be totally silenced. This is a real nuisance when used in settings where silent operation is necessary. At it's lowest setting messages can still be heard from the base unit by anyone in the room. Additionally,the handset quit working after only 1 year.This is the 2nd Uniden product that quit on me. A similar phone by G.E.has lasted me 10 years without a hitch."
4,I didn't like only two things about it,I like this phone but I had to buy a head phones for it because of its design I kept hanging off on people if I wanted to hold it with my head. The other feature that is very inconvenient is that it only has space for 10 numbers to store in its memory. Other wise it works great. I like it for the most part .
1,Not non-acetone!!!!!!,"Bought this because it was advertised as non-acetone. So it would be safe on my acrylic tips, however, the first listed ingredient is ACETONE!! I'm not sure why that is, but obviously not what I was looking for......as far as an acetone remover, it has a less offensive smell than pure acetone, and is more gentle that the pure, but if it was acetone I wanted, that's what I would have bought."
4,Good basic case,"It's a basic rectangular padded case - about 8 x 3.5 x 1.5 inches, single compartment, with a 3 inch belt loop on the back. The package says this case fits a Meridian GPS and 4 AA batteries. It does, but the batteries are just loose in the bottom of the case. The Meridian is pretty rugged on its own, but this case is just the thing to keep the screen from getting scratched up. And it is nice to have spare batteries in the same place as the GPS. Also, the case is roomy enough so you could probably slip one or two folded map printouts or geocache descriptions in it as well.On the other hand, because it has all that room it is a little bulky to wear on the belt. If that's what you want to do then you might look for a smaller generic case instead."
1,Gross,This product tastes so bad that even with it being diluted it was extremely difficult to get down. If you are gonna buy this then I suggest you get it in a capsule form instead. WOW!!
1,hello?,"All of you giving this a favorable review- are you stuck in a time warp or what? Did ya happen to notice the brilliant predictions in the book have not come true? Yeah, when have facts ever gotten in the way of the Green Nazi Agenda?Where is my aerosol can of deodorant, I got all hot after writing that?"
4,Trainlistening.,"In a world where every other movie has it's own soundtrack, few stand out. This one does to me. Obviously a liking for the movie helps, but even without the film this is an excellent listen. A great mix of old and new, mellow and upbeat. I mean when you stick Iggy, Lou Reed, and New Order on the same disc as Brian Eno, Blur, and Bedrock.....well you can't go wrong. Still a great play ten years later, and should be found cheap anyplace."
1,Worthless Cowardly Junk,"If the excerpts that appeared in the Sunday Post Magazine are any indication, this ""book"" is a seething boil full of envious pus from a ""newspaper"" that has had a chip the size of a redwood on its shoulder since the early 90s. And the anecdotes about Colburn and his synagogue reek of anti-Semitism.If you're interested in what this hateful bully has to say, I recommend a trip to your public library. Don't waste a dime on this piece of sewage."
5,The Spider to the Fly,"Utterly complelling, meticulously researched book on the vampiric business practices of AOL and how indifferently they participated in the demise of many smaller dot.coms. The overall destructive impact AOL may have had on the dot.com crash cannot perhaps be truely measured, but it's impossible not to be alittle awed by AOL's reckless savagery toward clients and staff alike. Couldn't put it down."
4,Perfect... if pieces weren't broken,"The doghouse was very easy to put together, it smells very wood-y (which I like) and as long as the dog isn't going to spending all its time in there, it's relatively sturdy. The unfortunate part about this shipment is that the box that it came in was completely trashed so I wasn't surprised when I opened it and found one side of the roof broken, with the nails sticking out in the corner. I'm glad that I'm handy because I fixed it up so that it wouldn't fall apart but because the integrity of the roof is compromised, I didn't attach the roof to the house. I also wonder if the wood boards that make up the floor of the house will need to be replaced later because they are not very thick. Otherwise, if your dog is under 50 lbs (I bought the medium size) isn't going to use the doghouse as its primary shelter then it should last at least a couple of years."
3,Overrated,"Not sure what people think is so great about this gun. If you read the reviews on any airsoft site, this gun is almost despised. Smaller kids will enjoy this gun, if you're willing to let them play with it, but this gun is pretty disappointing compared to a regular paintball gun or most other airsoft guns.While I wouldn't try running around with it like you would in a match, it's alright for indoor target shooting. It shoots somewhat hard, but the hopup sends the bbs flying almost straight up after ~75', and you can't adjust it. The barrel wobbles, and the bolt feels like it will snap off if you try to cycle it too fast."
5,Great Gun,I just got this gun on Tuesday and it is great. It is the most accurate and powerful gun I have ever gotten and it can easily go through cardbord. The bolt takes a little getting used to because at first it is very hard to slide it back. Bbs will not curve until the very end of their flight. The gun is as large as a .22 but lighter. It does not feel cheap and is the perfect primary weapon. The gun is beautiful in apperance. I would highly recomend getting this gun from Amazon because its is the cheapest. This gun is probally not a good starter gun unless you have shoot real guns before. Overall this gun is fantastic
5,This gun is worth it!!!,When I went to buy this gun I thought oh only [...] it cant be all that good. But it surprised me a ton. If this gun was [...] or more then I would have to give it a four and a half star but for the price this gun IS A BEAST.
3,decent gun... BUT not meant for aisofting,"this gun was my first sniper rifle so I was very excited to get it.. it's now about 6 years later and I've airsofted with it about 20 times.Pros:pretty cheep, great accuracy, great range, great power, reliableCons: iron sight is terrible (unusable)if you have any eye protection on, the shells are a pain (you WILL loose some).conclusion: If you are a beginner or just want to have cool piece to do target practice, this gun OWNS. But, if you want a tactical weapon for ""combat"" then you'd be better off spending twice as much on a weapon with a scope and a better magazine system. Why, because as soon as you use it you'll quickly realize you need to upgrade ad this model costs a fortune to upgrade (more than the gun is worth)Examples of ""better"" choices:$100 <[...]>$190<[...]>"
2,average,"not very high quality material. i had had it for about 3 or 4 months and then a peice inside shattered due to cold weather. when it WORKED it was fine. the range was good and it hurt like heck, but i'd go for a little more high quality gun. 2 stars"
2,Eh....,"To me it's a good gun, it's hefty and some what durable but it jams EASILY and the front sight actually fell off. Also, I tried to clear out the barrel after it jammed and there was a piece inside that came out fairly easily. The shells are difficult to keep track of, and the 25 shot clip broke on me. I have a couple shells but I only keep one on me so I don't lose it and I manually load It each time which is easier for me to do then loading the magazine each time. I mainly use it for plinking, and it was accurate before the front sight fell off."
4,how to use the 25 30 clip,u just take the clip put the end with the hole in it in the hole then push the clip into place and pull back on the lever near the opposite end of the gun and just pop it into place then loafd it up and ur good 2 go
3,okay,"listen i see your side but you got to remember all im saying is to make fun of people who are doing something they enjoy isnt right okay, im saving up for a 250$ gun so i can have some fun with my friends its what i want and guys like you who attack people and there hobbys , and to accomplish what?i am Rikente"
3,is this version 2 or 1,Is the UHC Super 9 Pro Spring Airsoft Rifleversion 2 or version 1 because i read that version one sucks compared to version 2
5,fast and good,"Delivery is fast. and the sleeve is in a very good condition, though it is a bit big for my 14inch IBM."
5,Fellowes Body Glove laptop case,"Great product, fairly priced. Nothing fancy, does just what it says it does and for a good value."
4,Hot flash help,"This product is good so far. My hot flashes and night sweats haven't totally disappeared yet, but they have diminished a lot. I've only had it a few weeks. I will buy another one and hopefully I will get the desired results."
2,Didn't Work For Me,"Not everything works for everybody, and this didn't work for me. I was on HRT and thought maybe I could taper off to a product like this, but the hot flashes came roaring back. I used something like this early on in menopause and it was fine, but as time went by and hormone levels dropped lower, the only thing that worked for me was conventional HRT. However, women who don't have severe symptoms may find this helpful."
4,More Please,"Interesting that 'Dublin, Ireland' mentions Radiohead because, to be absolutely honest, that's the only reason I bought this record. Very interesting, very exciting music, and yes, there definitely feels like there's a link between the instrumentation of Fake Plastic Trees and I'll Wear it Proudly. All in all, an intelligent effort. Costello has the fantastic ability to write seething, searing lyrics under great melodies. Unfortunately, I really don't think he's got a great voice (though neither did Lou Reed and I think he's great so...).I'd say that this is a good record to get if it is your first time purchasing a Costello record and you don't want to get your fingers burnt by purchasing something weak. A solid performance and the lyricism you would expect from one of pops finest."
4,Pretty Good!,"Its a great pillow , only complaint is that after the first night I had a crick in my neck so I have to sleep with another pillow under my head ! Other than that its great!"
4,Good buy!,This item came and I was so excited being 4 months pregnant. It has made my later pregnancy life go a lot smoother when I sleep. It does take up a lot of the bed but its worth the comfort!
2,CALLING IT GOSPEL IS A STRETCH!!,"THE SINGING IS FINE. BUT, CALLING IT GOSPEL IS A REAL STRETCH! SO, THE TWO RATING!NOT THE ARTIST'S FAULT, BUT PROBABLY AMAZON'S MIS-LABELING OF THE PRODUCT."
2,Over engineered fluff,"BeBe and CeCe demonstrate great comprimise in this sad collection of ""gospel"" songs because almost every cut can also be interpreted as a secular love song. Unlike a true gospel artist like Vickie Winans, who has the ability to evangalize through her music, these performers seem to be embarrassed about being inspirational. This disc is for the bubble gum Christian, not for the listener who takes his or her faith seriously."
3,Good enough for scouts,"Juat like the title says, it's good enough for scouts. It did show up with a small dent, but I figured it will get a few more small dents when my son takes it on camp outs."
4,Mostly Good,"This is initially a good fit. I have been painting my driveway and the going is fairly slow so after a while, say an hour or so, the fit is not as comfortable. The fumes of the product I am using on the driveway are exceptionally irritable but with this respirator the fumes are under control. The reason I took away one star is because I cannot adjust it so that my breath does not blow into my eyes. I have tried every way I know how with the straps but to no avail. Even though it is my own breath, I don't like it blowing into my eyes and causing them to water."
5,A Real CLassic Movie,I love the movies Kathryn Hepburn made in her senior years. She was so natural in her acting then more so than when she was younger. This movie is very hard to find. I saw it on TV once and have been hunting it ever since. I would have preferred a CD movie but they are not to be had. I am happy with my purchase and Am pleased it was all in very good working order.
4,Works great just needs to be brighter,"In the daytime it can be hard to see, just wish it was a little brighter. But, overall an excellent product and sure beats the tennis ball on a string that it replaced."
5,Perfect,Works perfectly for my wife. Installed easily and cleanly. Been installed for about 8 weeks and never had a problem. The light flashes which I didn't like at first but I find it's easier to catch my eye with a flashing light on the dashboard.
1,AVOID!!!,I purchased this prior to Xmas and finally got around to installing it (so I can no longer return it). It worked for the first 5 minutes and then died. Look elsewhere.
5,Out of Stock,"When I placed the order I was told it was in stock, I later received an e-mail saying this item was out of stock. The company kept me informed during the processing of my order. The product was well worth the delay in shipping. Easy to install.Roger P Pizio"
5,We love Olive,This is such a creative and cute Christmas story. Both my 2 yr old and 3yr old love it.
3,Separation,"American Apartheid gives wonderful analysis, statistics, and arguments in the underclass workers defense. It has strong views, which any book should have if it's trying to be heard. But when you read it (if you do) you will be able to come to your own conclusions. Just remember if you've never experienced how it's like to be one in the underclass/working class, it may be hard for you to relate, so keep an open mind."
4,emotions...,"i am currently reading the book and so far it's okay. i hope Jude has more interesting things happen to ob1-wan. i think it's time that Obi-wan got a ""girlfriend"". i agree with some of the other readers reviews. Oui Gon just dosen't seem to care about obi-wan that much. what's up with that?! Obi-wan and Qui gon should have more of a father/son relationship. this book is okay, but i think Jude can do better."
5,Thanks,"These are perfect, I have been turning my records into cd's so these were very helpful for me to get."
1,Bait and switch!!,"I want what I ordered.You did not send me what I ordered. Graphing Calculator with Memory, Equation Solver, Statistics, Black TEXTI83PLUS; Thats what I ordered and thats what I want. Don't try tobait and switch me.Not cool amazon...not cool at all!"
4,TI-83 Plus,This is a perfect middle of the road graphing calculator for my high school son. It has all the features needed without being too expensive.
3,calculator,My calculator is okay. I have trouble with the screen fading in and out all of the time. I had to get someone to help me figure out how to get my screen where i could see the numbers. It still fades in and out
3,"Fast shipping but I expected the product to be ""good"" as it was told on the product description.","Fast shipping, but I expected the product to be ""good"" as it was told on the description but it did not meet my expectation. But overall it was a good deal."
4,"umm, its a calculator","It's a great calc, nothing diffrent from the black version except some free software and it's a bit faster...but if you're a high school student, talk to your teachers, get a TI 89 because that's the highest level calc allowed on the AP exams, and it's much better, I wish I had known that before commiting myself to this one. But as far as the calc itself, its really awesome and very cool looking."
2,Inefficient for normal use,"I am an engineer, working on various algebraic and arithmetic problems frequently during each day. Like most engineers, I have a computer at my desk for doing the tricky stuff (ideally with tools like Mathcad or Mathematica). I thought I would get this calculator for the routine numerical insight stuff. It also remembers to stay in radians when you turn the power off (which many other ""lesser"" calculators don't). What a mistake! Lets say I have just calculated a result. Now I want to find the square root of it. On my trusty old HP-32S at home, I press the ""sqrt"" key. On this calculator I press ""sqrt"" ""2nd"" ""ANS"" "")"" ""ENTER"" (5 keys). Basically the EOS system (which this uses) does not allow you to see intermediate results other than by going through the above rite. I think TI is hoping this calculator will replace my computer - no chance! I'm taking it back."
5,very pleased,the calculator was like new. very prompt service. we highly recommend this service and nice savings to boot
3,Kickin' it Old School,"I admit, I didn't do much poking around in the world of apps before buying this calculator. I needed one for class, and had no idea phone apps would be an OK substitute. But that's not really the point, is it? The point is, why is Texas Instruments still making calculators like it's 1994. Seriously, I cannot find one bit of functionality that wasn't on my senior year TI graphing calculator. And you know what? This one cost about 50% more than that one.So, value wise, it's still a locked market. I would encourage you, if your teacher or professor allows it, to go the way of mobiled phone apps instead. That said, the functionality is pretty neat once you get the hang of it, and it does its job as advertised."
5,Nice...,"I found out that I needed a calculator for school and I searched everywhere for one but at last I decided to choose the Texas Instrument TI-83 plus. I'm satisfied with it now because it is not an intricate device but it is still able to calculate hard things. Since a lot of this is being sold, I can find many Apps which I could download onto this. If you are looking for a great calculator, you might as well buy the Ti-83 plus, you won't regret it."
1,Regret buying online,"When I received the product I realized that it wouldn't turn on even with new batteries. It seemed to have some battery corrosion from the previous owner. However, when my mom tried it worked. So I decided to get it. Then about 2 weeks later, when I was taking a math test, 3 of the number buttons weren't working. I was so frustrated! At least it was easy to return and I was refunded( not including shipping it back). I really wish I would have just went to Walmart to begin with. I could have saved a lot of time and hassle."
1,dis seller had to know this product was goin bad,well after a few weeks the calculator started actin weid screnn started changin colors and not working properly i didnt like it.
4,Texas Instruments TI-83,I was very satisfied with my purchase. The description was accurate and it was a good buy.
3,I'm mad at the sender not the company,"I dont remember who sent this but they obviously lacked common sense. They sent it in a box, not in a box with protective bubble wrap; just in a box. When i got it the screen had a big black spot in it but it was still functioning. Its a good calculator I just wish my sender didn't lack common sense."
4,Great deal,This calculator looks almost brand new. The only thing I didn't like is that the keys need to be pressed a little harder than I like. I guess it got a lot of use from someone else. Everything works great and it looks nice though so I'm happy.
2,money back,For over than 2 weeks i did not get the calculator but I get my money back. But I lost 2 weeks without studying to my daughter.
5,great sale,The calculator has an obvious ink blotch but is still useable and the ink was disclosed and I received the calculator within 5 days
4,good calculator,"thank you so much! i love the calculator. the ones at the store are really expensive, so the price was really good. the only complaint i really have was that my calculator wasn't working when i first got it, but i then changed the batteries and it worked. but overall, it works great and i really enjoy it! thank you!"
3,A little disapointed,"i expected it to have all the parts, it did not have the USB cord that comes in the package. But it works good~"
3,TI T183 Graphic Calculator...school required waste of money!,"This item is required by school for 9th grade Geometry. What a waste. Hardly used, a lot of money, unneccessary in the real world. In the world of computers, we still need crap in school...why, why, why!!!"
3,calculator fine,My problen is not with the calculator. It is with the cord. I only got 1/2 of the cord. REALLY! 1/2 of the cord! I contacted the seller and got NO! response. I gave this 3 stars because the calculator was fine & 1/2 of a cord (I will have to go buy a new cord)& the no response from seller. If you are big enough to only send 1/2 the cord at least be big enough to respond to the buyer.
4,Good Caluclator,"I prefer when reviewers get to the point, so I'll try it this time around.Pros:-Hugely long battery life (medium to heavy use for over 2 years, I've replaced the batteries once)-All of the functions I've ever needed for a math class-Often subjected to discounted price-Virtually indestructable-Does not use the (IMO) counter-intuitive Reverse Polish NotationCons-Poorly written instruction manual the size of a small moose-Some commonly used functions require far too many keystrokes to activate"
2,No batteries,"This item Didn't come with any batteries or even a case, it just came wrapped in bubble wrap . Wish I could return, could've purchased for the same price with all of these included !"
2,Poor display quality and difficult to learn,"I am not sure if it was the unit sent to me, but the screen wasn't very visible. It was a bit complicated to learn and a bit pricey. :("
5,ni&#8198;ce,"I bought this for my office.It helps a lot!It is recommended to graduates like me.PS,the cord is not very long,less than 1meter."
3,It's an outlet...it works.,I needed some extra outlets in one section of my room and this fit the bill. Good price and works as expected.
1,what happen with amazon?,"ok, i bought this surge agrouped with anothers itemsand never come to me.. i do not know what happen with this!also i do not know how contact amazon to tell this!"
1,Meh... I've had better in store,Super excited to get a deal on these - however theres always a catch. the cord is super short which is fine I expected that - however whenever you move the cord while its plugged in it will reset and restart everything - I have discovered this is due to faulty wiring/securing within the plastic and wiring - Overall I would return if I could- I'd say avoid unless they just gave me 2 defective ones.
4,great surge protector for the price,i really love this surge protector it works like a charm its working soo good i bought 2 more :)
3,Fun wig!,It was fun to wear but within an hour of putting it on the whole thing fell flat. I don't know if hairspray would work.
5,"Great book for hs, college and returning students",Gives great note taking advice and samples. Great for something that isn't taught much in schools (how to actually take good notes so that you can have something to study by). I would recommend to everyone. I surely will be giving them to new high school students and returning students. A++++++++++
2,Lacks examples,"I bought this book after reading Goldratt's ""The Goal"" and was a little disappointed. He presents the ""cloud"" and ""logic tree"" methods, but never really explains the procedure to use these for yourself."
4,Easy-to-read book and very inspiring,"It's a nice book about management and negotiations, and it tries to show you how to tackle issues from different points of view, how to negotiate difficult problems and how achieve the results you want in your organization.The only con is that the methodology used in the negotiations is not very well explained. I mean that the author during the book uses 2 to 3 methodologies in different problems but only one of these methodologies is well explained."
3,it's not luck!!!,"It's written in a worse style that the Goal.What's wrong with Eli?!The Goal was great, but this one, alas!"
4,Lighthearted and funny story about a female assassin,"You wouldn't expect a book about a female assassin who leaves more bodies in her wake than Typhoid Mary to be lighthearted and funny, but that's the perfect way to describe Steve Brewer's Bullets.Lily Marsden is one cold woman, but she's not without charm, especially in the eyes of Joe Riley, a former Chicago cop determined to track her down and bring her to justice.Brewer has created a passel of unique and hilarious characters and thrown them into a page-turning plot that had me laughing out loud despite a hail of bullets.Reviewed by David Montgomery, Chicago Sun-Times"
2,Cheap material--good service,"I bought this item a while ago for my Ford Ranger. When I first tried to install, the plastic bolts broke on me. I bought stainless steel bolts from a local hardware store and installed it. The handle lasted a good 6 months before the whole assembly finally broke down. I live in Hawai'i so it's not like we have extreme weather here. The part was inexpensive and the company did offer to replace the handle when I emailed about the broken bolts. I would have replaced it but I put truck liner and didn't feel like peeling it away to get to the handle."
5,An important book for those who wish to understand Germany,"This book is a close look at the political role of the Prussian army in German society. It is heavily skewed towards covering the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and I wish more had been devoted to the seventeenth and eighteenth (this period occupies only the first 20% of the book). But that aside, what it *does* choose to cover, it covers well. Professor Craig teases apart the various determinants of the Prussian army's historical behavior--the Junker social origins, the political relationship with the crown, the ideological and pedagogical atavisms, the institutional and technological innovations, and, ultimately, the Prussian army's forceful veto power over the historical aspirations of the German masses. This book cannot be ignored by anyone curious about the course of German history."
5,The Best Book You Will Find On The Prussian Army,This work of Craig's is the definitive one volume history for the Prussian Army. You can read lots of books about the different Prussian wars or Prussian history - but they will ALL list this book in the bibliography. So do yourself a favor and read this first.
5,A Fine Book by a Man who Knows A Lot about Germany,"I had to read this book for a History of Germany Course at Mary Washington College. I remember my Professor, Blakemore, hyping the book. He was right. Based on this book, it is easy to see why Gordon Craig is considered one of the best Historians when it comes to Germany. This book is not only a history of the German army, but it is really a history of Germany it self. It was especially interesting to read about the importance of the Blood Oath of Loyalty taken by the German Army to Hitler before WWII. If you are interested in Germany, I highly recommend this book."
2,Maybe not good for puppies,"I have a 3 month old pup (border collie/german shepherd) and he tore this thing up and was pulling out the stuffing in a matter of minutes. I was hoping he would learn to chew with it in a non-destructive manner, but that wasn't the case.He doesn't go for rubbery toys like kongs, but he went nuts for this and played with it non stop until I took it away after about an hour (because he was sort of choking on the stuffing). Don't let a puppy play with these stuffed toys unattended or they seriously could choke.At this point I plan to pull out all the stuffing and let him tear up the outer shell, then toss it. Kind of expensive for a disposable toy. My cousin's adult dog has a similar stuffed toy which he (the dog) takes care of and doesn't destroy."
5,The Ultimate Paranoid Thriller,"There's the central character in this book, Matt Sinkage. He's a paranoid. Or not. He knows the truth about an extraterrestrial invasion, and he will fight each and every operative of the plan, despite the fact that he is... I better stop here. Poor Matt! He's going to be hunted by too many agents, private eyes, operatives, politicians and journalists, although he himself is a natural born hunter, and won't stop stalking at the enemies of mankind until the moment he would be able to end the whole invasion plan for good. Believe me, this is good stuff. Everything starts with ""Secret Affairs, Red Shadows"", follows up in ""Tarnished Dreams"" and has the perfect, unpredictable end in the last page of ""The Great Fear"". Anyone who was a fan of the ""Heavy Metal"" magazine back there in the eighties must go get this book at once (names that come to my head are Torres, Chaland, Serge Clerc). This story really fascinated me!"
3,"Close, but no cigar.","I bought the book because I was looking for ideas with regard to converting a gasoline powered vehicle to electric power. If this is your purpose, then this book has absolutely no value for you.On the other hand, if you are simply interested in the grotesque manner in which large corporations lurch along, then you will find this amusing - and possibly even worth while. Having spent a goodly number of years within the corporate world, I can empathize with this man. His main problem, however, is that he did not have the good sense to get out early."
1,AVOID,I uploaded a new version. Disaster! Would not take import from older version. Worked with my IT expert to get it transfered but now it won't sort and goes to error. NO tech support. Promised support but ends up to be nothing -- really nothing!
5,Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow Review,"I don't know about you but I'm a huge Castlevania fan. I've been hooked ever since I played Symphony of the Night. This game is very similar to its prequel Aria of Sorrow. In this game you are Soma Cruz and what do you know? You end up back at Dracula's castle. Only this time you're there to stop two ""dark lord candidates"" from becoming Dracula himself. A couple of cool new additions to this game are the abilities to level up your souls by collecting multiple souls from the same monster, the Doppelganger soul which allows you to switch equipment and soul sets with the press of a button, and finally the ability to create your own weapons. I give this game five stars because once I started playing it I couldn't put it down. If you are a longtime fan or just a new beginner to the serious this one is an awesome addition to your video game collection."
4,A very good side-scroller,"This is the game that convinced me to buy a Nintendo DS. The first time I played this was on my friend's system. It is a very solid adventure, with RPG elements (level, stats, equipment). The soul system is well thought-out and balanced. The enemy mobs are very animated and unique. You have the choice of viewing the map or your character status on the top screen, so the days of pausing 100 times are now over. This game was much more enjoyable than the Megaman X + series. If you don't have the patience for games like Tales of Phantasia or Golden Sun, this action/adventure is for you.-"
1,Don't order this version!,"This game has the dreaded ""Konami's BEST"" red bar of doom on it. Don't support a reprint that ruins the original box art. Buy somewhere else."
2,"If you live in middle America, try ""Kitchen Cosmetics"" by Jeanne Rose","I live in the Chicago-land area & many of these ingredients are very difficult to find. Unless you are prepared to send away to Canada or Britain to aquire some of the ingredients, give this a pass. The vast majority of recipes contain at least 1 item that I cannot purchase locally. When I did gather the items together, the recipes are very easy to work & have been very pleasant to use. I have found that the ingredients & recipes in Jeanne Rose's ""Kitchen Cosmetics"" easier to aquire & just as easy to assemble & use."
5,adorable purse,This is the cutest purse for a young girl; it's even more adorable than the picture. Lots of room and pleasing to the eye. My friend's daughter carries it everywhere; definitely glad I purchased this item.
4,Drums Among the Mohawk,"A very entertaining movie, this was bought for my husband as a gift, he loved the movie and has watched many times over, he collects all the good old time movies thanks Amazon for being able to get these old classics and shipped out to Australia, otherwise we would not be able to see the movies."
3,The Old Colonialist verses Indians Stroy,"Henry Fonda in his early years, does a wonderful job in a stereotypical roll. It's mainly a drama, with some humor inserted here and there. The color is wonderfully rich, and at least appears to have been shot outside, with only maybe the fort and interiors being shot on a sound stage. I won't say it's historically accurate, but does give at least the colonist views fairly accurately."
1,Waste of time and money,"All the electrodes look the same. The ""battery"" didn't work. The wires break. Shipment is extremely expensive. I am very disappointed."
1,Disappointed,"This product advertised that it was the entire book on tape, which it was not. The book is on 4 cassettes and only 2 were sent. Also, the cover said it was tapes 1 and 2, which it was not - it was tapes 3 and 4 so I can't even listen to the first half of the book because it only included the second half of the book. Definitely disappointed and probably will never order anything again from an individual seller."
2,Okay...if you feed it one sheet at a time,"Count me among those with the paper jam problem. If I have more than one sheet of paper in the feeder, it will suck all of them in and jam. It is remarkably efficient in that it does this EVERY time! The printer worked fine for a year or so, but now I'm forced to feed it one sheet at a time. Seems like this is a common problem."
4,pretty good little printer,"i think my roommate printed over 500 pages on this printer... but that was 2 years ago, and I'm a student. so this toner hold up quite nicely.as for reliability. hm.. jams at inopportune times. yeah, the paper does jam occasionally, but its not that big of a deal since i unjam and continue printingspeed is fast. color is good. what else do you want in a printer? i recommend it"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"My 6 year old daughter was so excited to receive this as a gift and couldn't wait to get started. However, we never got the machine to work. We put the whole thing together and it would not heat up so you can't melt the chocolate. We took it apart and checked the directions - still didn't work.I guess this worked to my advantage as I would have had to take it apart to clean it each time it was used which would have involved a screwdriver.This item is not child friendly and is of very poor quality."
3,This is a Pretty Good Toy,I like the Hershey Chocolate Magic Maker becauseyou get to make your own chocolate candies.The only problem isit takes a long time.
1,Very disappointed,We've been very disappointed w/ this toy. My daughter received it as a gift and it only worked 1 time. She then received a 2nd one which quit working before it was even warmed up. So now she has some rather expensive and tiny chocolate molds.
5,Love it ;-O,"This is the 2nd workout from this instructor and I love it as much as the earlier one. She's outgoing and encouraging and that helps you get through the workout while having fun.It's pretty much non-stop from start to finish. She teaches you an easy move and then ramps it up by making the moves more complex. It's like other layering step workouts; you learn the moves and then add more but she cues really well and so it's easy to get them down right because you know in advance what's coming up and also you go over them a few times. You can pick your own level too because you can either do low impact modified moves, or power moves. It's about a 40 minute step routine (then extra time for your warm up and cool down) and the dvd ends with an abdominal workout.She's a great instructor and it's a fun routine. There is good music here and trust me - when you get started, the next thing you know, it's done and you've burned heaps of calories. It's fun and I really enjoy doing this."
4,"Indispensable, but high-time for a CD-ROM","As everyone knows, this is a unique product and an enormous aid to getting published. However, it is a victim of its own success insofar as there is a huge amount of information here. It is increasingly hard to navigate and cries out to be published in CD-ROM or other electronically searchable media."
5,Poet's helper,"This book was very helpful in obtaining my dream of publishing my own book ""Remedies for the Soul"" After reading it and sending out correspondence to various leads in the book, one year to the day of purchase I was published and did not have to pay to be published."
1,Muy religioso pero sin profundidad en el tema...,"Soy profesional, madre soltera, y al comprar el libro entendi desde el principio que este seria un ""Relato"" de la experiencia vivida por la autora. Sin embargo, al leerlo me sorprendio la simplicidad de la narrativa y lo REPETITIVA de las explicaciones. Por supuesto que creo en Dios con todo mi corazon, pero el contenido de todo el libro pudo haberse resumido en 2 o maximo 3 paginas: ""Dejarlo todo en las manos de Dios y aceptar con humildad"". Quizas sea el resultado de alguna traduccion del texto en ingles, no lo se, pero en realidad considero que No es un libro para mujeres ocupadas y exigentes que tratan de sacar algun tiempo para leer y esperan algo de mayor nivel literario. No lo recomiendo."
3,Not big enough for normal straps,"I purchased this item and immediatly noticed upon arrival that the slits in which the strap go into are way too small for a typical strap. Way too small, maybe like a third of the width. I just have a normal planet waves strap, and it does not fit. However, it does hold the XDS transmitter nicely and securely. So looks like I will have to get creative with duct tape or something.UPDATE:When attached with rubber bands to my planet waves strap, it stays on pretty snugly. But you need to attach it with something."
3,PERFUMED!,"Wow. I tried to wear one of these gloves straight out of the box but the heavy, flowery ""dryer sheet"" fragrance triggered an old, rarely troublesome asthmatic reaction. The box had to go to the outside trash bin, the gloves went in a bowl of suds. Yeesh! The glove seemed snug and comfy for the few minutes I had it on. I'm sure they'll be fine once I get the perfume out of them, but others sensitive to fragrance should be warned. You just wouldn't expect to be overwhelmed by fragrance with this product."
3,IMAK compression gloves,The overcast stitching at the end of the fingers is not adequate. It begins to unravel after just a few wearings.
3,Okay,not what i expected its not made sturdy enough and is starting to ravel along the finger tips and I hand washed it carefully and letting it dry naturally
3,Arthritis sufferer,I bought these because my hands swell all the time. They are suppose to prevent swelling promote circulation. If only I could remember to wear them.
5,Helps a lot!,Works to relieve pain and offers support. Would order again!Fast shipping and just as described by Amazon. The added warmth does seem to help.
2,"Not 2 pair, 1 pair",This is not 2 pair of gloves. It is one pair. I hardly find it worth the cost plus shipping. We contacted Amazon and they said that it states it is one pair.
5,"Good for tendonitis (I need them for insulation, not support)","I purchased these 2 years ago for use in my office at work as it tends to always be a bit chilly. I don't get cold easily, but my tendonitis is aggravated by cold, so keeping my wrists and hands warm is important. These gloves, while thin, are just enough insulation to do the trick. They are very comfortable and don't in any way hamper my typing or anything else I need to do in the office. I tried a few other type of fingerless gloves and these have been the best and most comfortable I found for office use."
5,It does work!,"I love the gloves that I bought. It really helps my hands especially that I am working on the computer daily, and I am having a problem with poor circulation. These gives me relief. Worth the money."
5,Arthritis Gloves,The gloves work as advertised. They provide relief and allow me to do finger exercises with a minimum of discomfort.
2,Mines is broken,"I just got the TV and I'll be shipping it back tomorrow morning. The TV looks great and the picture is good too. Except for the fact that mines is defective it's otherwise perfect. I think the problem is with the black light. Sometimes when I turn on the TV, the picture turns off a second later and only the sound remains. I have to play turning in on and off for the picture to remain. I don't know if I'll have it replaced by another Viewsonic because I need something dependable"
2,Lots of features but poor acoustics,"Yes, reasonably priced and has many desirables features, but it sounds like your talking through a tin can. I can't recommend this as a primary phone, but maybe as a seldom used secondary one. Price is very competitive, sound quality is not."
3,Creatively abrasive,"3 1/2 starsThis is a great contradiction in it's avant garde tendencies in the same vein as a Sleepytime Guerilla Museum, coupled with it's no frills catchiness and demented pop homage. When it is not overdwelling on it's sickly unique style, the bandmates pull out some personified sounds from their instruments, crafting somthing special for the demented popster in us all...Future subtle influences that this band affected are abound in this album, and the music works best when all of those elements are balanced out, making tight rhythmically, all of that loose creativity.."
1,I would not recommend,"I was very unhappy with this book. As a first time buyer, i was hoping to get an exhaustive review of the subject. Unfortunately this is what I ended up with:1. Chapters written by the ""experts,"" and not one person. Unfortunately, this means there is no continuity between chapters. No growth of understanding. Each chapter could (and probably was) be a link on the expert's website.2. The experts like to advertise their services within the chapter. Thus, their opinions are obviously biased and the reader is not sure what to believe.3. I read the whole thing, and I honestly can tell you, I need to buy another book. Many terms were never defined; there never was even a clear outline of how the buying process should be initiated, what steps to take, etc."
5,"Quirky, Goofy Fun with Great Lessons for Kids","This is without a doubt one of my favorite children's books. The book is for 4-8 year-olds, but most 4-5 year-olds might not understand the artwork's quirky, abstract nature.Mr. Lunch is a dog, but a very intelligent dog who gets invited to appear on television for his bird-chasing abilities. Mr. Lunch and his bird-pal Ambrose have many great and goofy adventures along the way (especially on the plane) to the television appearance...which doesn't go exactly as planned...`Mr. Lunch' gives kids a whole cargo plane full of wonderful learning opportunities in: aviation, identifying animals, how to say ""goodbye"" in several languages, city and country life, airport procedures, music, science, cooking...you name it! A very imaginative, wacky, fun book!Ages 4-830 pgs."
3,has anyone bought this yet?,"I am thinking buying it, but I would like to see somer reveiwes from those who bought it. It looks good and space saving but I am not sure how stable it is to hold a 70 lb bag."
4,Hours of fun,"My daughter loves her Swirl Master. The day she got it, I had to pull her away from it so she wouldn't use all of the paper and paint up in one day. Less is more with this product. A little paint goes a long way. You can easily replace the paper with your own cardstock cut to size. I gave it 4 stars because the clean up can be a bit much after hours of play. It's time-consuming trying to clean all of the paint that splatters on the splash guard and inside the swirler. And if you don't clean it adequately, it's just going to build up and not work well. But my daughter loves it and has created some nice art with it. Her favorite part is sprinkling the glitter for a final touch."
4,"GREAT GAME WITH MULTIPLE MODES, STORY MODE DIFFICULT","I got this game as a gift from my grandmother and thought it was going to be another rip-off game on the GBA, but I was wrong. With 6 modes (Arcade,Training,Single-Race,Story,Bonus, and Championship)there's plenty of races to keep you busy for a while. You can choose from about 10 racers, each from a different country. And in single-race mode, you can choose from any track. The graphics are fairly good, the minuature cars look cool. The turning takes some time to get used to. Story mode is pretty difficult. I've only made it to the second level on story mode. The 1st level requires you to get a lap time of 18 seconds or less on the first track, and the second level requires the same, but you must collect 3 coins while doing so. Each story mode level involves a character and plot. For the cheap price ... I would suggest this game for racing fans."
