3,they were nice,i owned the form2 headphones.after i bought them i was dissaponted.they didnt sound as good as they clamed they would.i gave them away.
1,Bah!,"This story stinks! How dare the author of this book show selfishness like that and glorify it! The story is lame and evil. A dummy hen asks everyone one the Farm to help her bake some bread. They all have better things to do, so she does on her own. Then when it is all done, all their things are done, so they kindly ask if they could have a slice. She meanly refuses, and hogs all the delicious bread in front of the poor, starving animals. This story is a bad influnce on kids, because it glorifies gluttony and selfishness. This book ought to be banned."
5,Great addition to the base game.,"If you have Ticket To Ride: USA, I highly encourage purchasing this expansion. It adds a lot of new routes, and a new Globetrotter bonus card. The biggest benefit from this expansion though, is that it provides human-sized playing cards instead of the half-size ones that come with the base game. These are easier to handle and shuffle than the others, and the expansion provides replacements for all of them, so you don't need to use the original cards ever again!"
5,Ticket to Ride and the Expanded Version are quite the awesome pair,I enjoy every moment I get to play this game with friends and family! And I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys playing a good board game.
5,Bought it as a gift.,Got this for my wife for Christmas as Ticket to Ride is one of her favorite board games. Definitely a great addition to the game and the larger cards just makes everything easier for my giant monster hands.
3,"Good text, poorly worded multiple choice questions!","The text is written very well, however, the multiple choice questions in the student workbook are written poorly."
3,Not that bad,"Its a low budget film so don't expect anything special. However there are nice cars and hot women, something rare for low budget films. Miguel Nunez Jr. does a great job in this film and was the most entertaining. Of course the two girls on the cover didn't hurt, they along with the other girls didn't have much lines, but they were great to look at. I guess that's why their models. Anyways it's worth watching at least once."
2,Dont expect to much,This book wasn't very expensive but it wasn't that good either. If you collect jewelry books like me you will already have all the pictures. If you are buying other books at this price it may be worth an add on but dont expect to much. The photos are of medium quality and the text is poor.
1,Corroded to valve stem,"These caps look nice and feel pretty solid, but corroded onto the valve stems so badly in less than one year that they were nearly impossible to get off. It took penetrating oil and vise grips, and even then, the valve stem threads are pretty chewed up. If you use these, I suggest applying an anti-seize compound."
2,He Assumes way too much knowledege.....,"With a title like ""Ultimate Beginner Series"" he assume way too much. He is very good and I have other DVD's by Keith. I just wish they would show you the cords in a box like the other DVD's in this series. In this one you are stuck looking at his hands trying to figure out what to play"
5,Nothing Less Than Essential,"Not a wasted minute in this four disc set! This is the history of King Crimson carefully selected and sometimes re-recorded in the case of some earlier songs. Incredible oversized 12""x12"" 62 page book is filled with rare photos and detailed blow by blow events that shaped the bands history."
1,Pike Street Flannel Sheet - just too much lint,"Considering that the price on these was very low - I would say they are okay. But comparing these sheets with the European ones I have - these ""Pike Street"" sheets are almost unacceptable. Too fuzzy. You will have the lint all over the place...."
1,very bad not worth even $0.01,Please avoid buying these if you can.....these are not worth the cost of $5.99 also....
4,Not very thick- but great for $5 a set,"I ordered the outdoor pattern. Loved them. THey were thin, but I was still happy with a full set of sheets for $5! Mine did fine in the wash. I would not pay more than $10 a set for them."
3,"Good war film - good video copy, awful audio","Although the film print is good, the audio is horrific. Within two (2) seconds as the music swells under the titles, there is distortion. You also have to pump up the volume of your device on this transfer. The audio throughout the film is all over the place, worse with music, sometimes with explosions (its war), and a bit ugly with dialogue and music under.No one at Warners took the time to Q.C. this. I assume it was farmed out. Of course, ""they"" may say it is/was the best print available. Perhaps I just got a terrible copy since these are ""allegedly"" made to order.Also, the original price was $15.99, not $19.99 (as of this writing)."
2,nothing special,"along with the pillow, a disappointment. nothing special and not worth buying. didnt even take this blanket with me on the plane once i received and saw it."
3,How Far Can You Go!!!!!!!!,"The book is a marvellous commentary on the 20th Centuary Catholic Church and contraception - highlighting, often comically, the Church's own contradictions and dead end arguments - whilst maintaining the reader's understanding of why and how people avidly follow doctrines that are often detrimental to them, until they hopefully force change and growth. It will amuse and enlighten non, lapsed and practicing Catholics. But BEWARE, ""Souls & Bodies"" is the SAME book as ""How Far Can You Go?""."
4,Good book for students interested in History.,"I bought this book for one of my Life Skills students and he loves it. The reading level (which was found on the main Lexile website) was accurate and it perfectly aligns with the student's reading goals, being just challenging enough to move the student forward."
5,cool,this cd is is sweat and i think every one should get it. its the best cd ive heard in a long time
1,A really cool group with Talent and good looks? Um......NO!,"I havent bought their cd or INTEND to, unless possibly I go mentally insane. I, unfortunatly,have heard some of their songs and all i have to say is: screeching fingernails going down a board sounds better then these weirdos. They look like dogs.........no talent no looks..........you couldnt PAY me to buy their cd.......YUCK!"
1,Lack of industry and lack of artistry,"In terms of normal circumstance I wouldn't be writing this damn review but I have been astonished enough to try my hand this once. As an admited sucker for the likes of Dylan, Tom Waits, Frank Zappa et al maybe I'm not best qualified to acess the quality of this kind of music but can anyone out there among you offer me a reasoned argument on why this kind of dry hollow sound sells so much and why the aformentioned sell hardly at all. Just a question."
4,THE AWESOME 5IVE FROM UK!,"At first i only thought: Oh, God, another boy-band And i was mistaken, 'cause these gorgeous guys are here to stay and for good!! Experts say they're the new blokey Spices, but i think to deserve more than that. What can i say? They're young, they're talented, and their music has a funky tune that's definitely unique!! Keep it up, guys!"
5,Definatly one to blast in the car!,This Cd is unbelievible. When ever in am in the car I blast it! All the fast somgs just put me in a dancing mood! and the slong songs are perfect for anytime! I love it! It never leaves my car!
5,scott is the best!,SCOTT ROBINSON IS HOT! SCOTT IS NO.1# SCOTT IS CUTE! PERFECT! SWEET! AMAIZING! KING! VERY GOODY IN SINGING! AND VERY VERY VERY HOT HOT HOT HOT
3,This CD is great but it is not my thing. I prefer rock.,"This CD is great for fans of the pop world, but when I listened to the samples I found that all the songs were practically the same. It is good but in a cheesy kind of way."
4,"Good, but horny","I think that Five has alot of talent, but are too focused in on sex. They are more hip-hop then pop, so that seperates them from most of the boy bands out there, but should in their next album avoid that. That is why most people don't like them. I think that they should keep their distinct style, but should send out more positive messages."
4,Such a pop esq track,"I think this album is really quite good if your in the mood for sickly sweet teeny bopper music with a ""hard core"" feel to it, provided by the vocal styles of J and Abs. The majority of the cd is bareable and the hidden track is a good bonus. I recon that if Five's next album is as good as this one it should sell big!."
5,"Not just another ""boy band""","Five is in no way just another ""boy band"". Their music is a blend of pop, hip hop, rock and rap. Plus they have 2 beautiful ballads: ""When I Remember When"" and ""Until the Time is Through"". I love every song on the cd. It's a must have. Oh and they are five gorgeous guys!!"
5,Five Is Awesome!,"Five is an awesome group. My favorite song is ""When The Lights Go Out!"" Go FIVE!!!!!!"
5,5ive smashin' lads...,What could I say is that it's the best smashin' album ever! Loads of jammin' tunes so what are ya waitin' for..??? Go out and get ya self a copy of it..
5,"THE CD IS GREAT, 5IVE AS ALL THE RIGHT MOVES","5IVE'S CD IS GREAT, ALL THE FAST SONGS HAVE A NICE UP-BEAT SOUND TO THEM AND ALL THE SLOW SONGS ARE GREAT, ESPECIALLY ""UNTIL THE TIME IS THROUGH"" I LOVE THE WAY SCOTT AND RITCHIE SING IN THAT SONG, I LOVE ALL THE RAPS J AND ABS DO ON THE CD AND WHEN THEY WERE ON DISNEY THEY DID SUCH AN AWESOME JOB, THEY ALL HAD SO MUCH HYPE IN THEM AND THEY WERE ALL DOWN TO EARTH AND REALLY FRIENDLY AND I LOVE ALL THEIR DANCE MOVES THEY ARE ALL HOT! MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE, ""IT'S THE THINGS YOU DO."" ""WHEN THE LIGHTS GO OUT."" ""SLAM DUNK(DA FUNK)"" ""EVERYBODY GET UP"" AND ""UNTIL THE TIME IS THROUGH"" AND THE REST OF THE SONGS R GREAT 2, BYE BYE(I LOVE 5IVE)"
4,i really like their album!,"i think that they are awesome and that their music is appealing especially to teens like me.you'll love it ! their songs ""when the lights go out"","" it's the things you do"","" everybody get up"" and ""got the feeling"" really got me grooving."
1,I thought it sucked!!!!!,Why do people out there listen to this sh*t?Five are LOSERS!!!!!YOU SUCK!! Talk about Un-co. dorks!!!
5,invincable,"I BROUGHT THE INVINCEABLE ALBUM FOR MY DAUGHTER, I PLAYED IT AND LOVED IT, SO NOW I HAVE THE ALBUM.THE BEST SONG IS WE WILL ROCK YOU.I ALSO HAVE THERE FIRST ALBUM (FIVE).SO GO BUY IT AND PUMP UP THE VOLUME......."
1,The Wedding,The WeddingThe Wedding by Dorothy West is a very well written piece of literature. The southern influence in her writing is very obvious and adds to the overall effect the book gives. Even though the book is mainly focused around the Wedding itself there are many underlining topic and themes. These give the reader a better understanding of the whole family history and the characteristics of individual people in the book. The upper class setting of the oval island makes the prejudices people have for one another stand out. I thought that this book was very enjoyable and would recommend it to any who wishes to read it.
1,Spend your hard earned money on the Anthology,"Save for some of the commentaries made by John Lennon's sister and the Beatles ex-chauffeur it is a totaly inept documentary, most of the people interviewed seam to be more interested in telling their story than that of the Beatles, if you are a Beatles fan you will learn nothing new. Particularly irritating is the background music which is not Beatles music (go figure!!!) but some cheap approximation, they probably did not have permission to use original Beatles songs. Spend your hard earned money on the Anthology if you don't allready have it"
3,"Good, but not for the price","I got this in a mall last year for $5.99 and thought I was getting ripped off considering what it was, but bought it anyways because it was only $5.99. It is literally a rollerball in a holder- you could use an empty roll-on deodorant bottle and get the same results."
1,"Instead Buy ""Up in the Old Hotel""","All the material here and much, much, much more is included in the excellent Mitchell compilation ""Up In The Old Hotel"" - buy that in hardcover; you'll thank me in 25 years [or your children will.]NOTE: Amazon's touting a ""savings"" from buying 'Hotel' & 'Harbor' jointly!Twinning Hotel & ""My Ears Are Bent"" might be a fit, though."
2,Fair to mediocre,It is an old story and I got in on it late. Sorry I can't stay longer and say more.
2,"Not bad, but they've done better","Perhaps my expectations were so high because my prior Scorpions purchases before this have been Humanity just recently in 2008, and only Crazy World (Great album!!)in 1990 when it first came out. I guess this album had a lot to live up to. I've always loved the Scorps but just haven't been following them closely. ""Unbreakable"" shows their hard side, yes, but it's not as creative or artistic as many of their other albums, which is what I truly like them for. If you're a die hard Scorps fan, you'll want this for your collection. Otherwise, just download a couple songs like ""My Generation"", ""Maybe I, Maybe You"", and perhaps even ""Through My Eyes"", and you'll have the best songs on the CD. This one just didn't appeal to me as much as the others I've purchased."
5,Unbreakable- Unbelievable!,"This album is awesome, I can't take it out of my CD player! I'm a younger generation Scorps fan whose favorite album is Crazy World but Unbreakable just rocked my world! The songs, the vocals, the playing and the production are all absolutely awesome! I can't fault ths album and won't trouble myself to analyse the songs because they're all rocktastic mate! Enjoy-I guarantee you will!"
4,Unbreakable...unbelievable!,"Having been a fanatical Scorps fan since 1982,and particularly loving their albums from the 70's and early 80's, I had lost interest in them over the past decade. I am thrilled to report that ""Unbreakable"" has renewed my love for them all over again. I dutifully continued to purchase every album they have ever released, but after buying the dreadful ""Eye II Eye"" I had vowed to never again buy another Scorps album. However, after reading some great reviews of ""Unbreakable"" and reports that it was a return to the sound of ""Blackout"", I had no choice but to shell out the money and acquire myself a copy of ""Unbreakable"". I have to echo the sentiments expressed by all of the other reviewers on this site - this is truly a return to form, and the lyrics are as endearingly silly as ever, making this the best Scorps album since ""Love at First Sting"". Woo hoo - it's about time!"
5,Both are Exceptional Movies... !,"Michael is a great movie and I love John Travolta in this role! He is lovable, a different sort of character for him which is another reason I loved this movie... I love that he is not the typical angel role in this movie!City of Angels, Oh My Gosh! I was so touched by this movie...I love, love, love this movie! A friend recommended I watch it and it has had the strongest impact in my life... it is wonderful! Get your tissues! And I will send you a hug before you watch it... it is phenomenal! One of the five most touching, heart warming movies I have ever had the pleasure to watch."
2,Clever Idea. Poor Execution,"Only Gore Vidal would conceive a plot about characters being like movie stars and appearing in films, TV shows and other novels when they are off duty in the novel you are reading.The idea was great, but its execution was flippant and there is gratuituous everything. I stayed with it only to see how he would tie it all up. Had the book been longer, I wouldn't have finished it.I'm still not sure that I get the significance of Duluth being 9 miles from the Mexican border with a view of Lake Erie, although I have some ideas.Vidal is a great a writer. Even in this mish mash there are some great ideas and wonderful turns of phrase."
2,The emporor makes fun of himself for being naked?,"While the book is funny and drew my interest in what would happpen, it was ultimately sterile and uninvolving. Quite a disappointment from the author of two of my favorites, ""Julian"" and ""Creation"". I get that it is (among other things) a satire on the dry, lifeless, oh too clever world of Post-Modernism. This still does not redeem it from being dry, lifeless, or oh too clever. Granted it archly satirizes much of what is wrong in modern American life, but that only gets you so much credit."
3,True Betrayals,"This was okay, but it didn't hold my interest compared to other books by Nora Roberts that I have read. Still, it was worth the price to get all three novels in one book."
1,only one of 24 volumes,"I just received my order from Motor City Books and it is not what was promised in the description. The books were advertised under, ""The Family Creative Workshop (24-volume set)"". I only received one of the 24 volumes and wasn't even told which one I was receiving in my shipment order. I own many of these volumes but wanted to have a full set and the price seemed right. Thought it was too good to be true and sure enough it was. Very misleading bait and switch."
2,Has Edgerton lost his touch?,"I was thoroughly disappointed with Clyde Edgerton's newest novel. Edgerton fails to create memorable and true-to-life characters as he usually does; I had trouble keeping names straight in the book, and I never felt as if I knew any of them. ""Where Trouble Sleeps"" is uncharacteristically vulgar and crude for a work by Edgerton. Frequent profanity and allusions to masturbation that have nothing to do with the plot are things one would expect from a mainstream novelist, not from a highly esteemed Southern author like Clyde Edgerton. Has he sold out to the rest of America and kissed the true South goodbye? Only his next novel will tell."
1,Too quirky for me,"This was a quirky book about a small southern N.C. town. They have a strange visitor (Jack Umstead) who has come to scope out the place and maybe steal something. The author introduces several people who live in the town, however, he doesn't really develop them. They just play the parts of simple town folk. The stranger tries to fit in and even gets friendly with some of the people in town before he does his evil deed. The book is suppose to be funny and it is in some parts. I just didn't think it was hilarious. I wish it was, it might have made for a better read."
2,Very disappointing!,"I am a huge Clyde Edgerton fan, and I'm sorry to say I was VERY disappointed with this book. It just never seemed to get off the ground. I was expecting the type of story that I fell in love with in *Raney* and *Walking Across Egypt* (both of which left me in tears, I laughed so hard). If you're looking for Listre, you're not going to find it in this book Oh well, I guess I'll wait on his next one..."
3,Humorous scenes illuminate small town story,"Of all of Edgerton's novels I've read so far, this was my least favorite, although there are portions that entertained me. In small town Listre in the 50's, 7 year old Stephen's life is unremarkable except for occasional oddities, such as his mother taking him and a friend to see the electric chair (for a deterrent) and the arrival of the mysterious ""gypsy man,"" Delbert Jones (re name: Jack Umbaugh) whose slealth gets him into town but can't get him out.Edgerton's live reading from this book was the most entertaining author reading I have been lucky enough to attend--he read in character, played the banjo, and made the scenes he presented come to life. I was a bit disappointed that the whole novel didn't live up to the promise of the portions he shared aloud.For a better sample of his work, read Walking Across Egypt, Raney, and The Floatplane Notebooks."
2,A Dissapointing Book!,"I had previously read my first Higgins book ""Eye of the Strom"". I could hardly wait to read ""Sheba"". At first the book showed signs of life. The more that I read the worse it got. A book about doing battle with the Nazis in the desert in Egypt showed great promise. Our hero and the lady hunting for her husband had started the book off on a good footing. Then the book fell apart. The plot hit rock bottom. The hoped for action never took place. The excitement level of this book was a 1 on a scale of 1 to 10. I began to wonder if Higgins had hired a ghost writer. I was glad that I finally finished the book so that I could be through with it.A very dissapointing book.I do not reccomend it to anyone."
1,Horrible! Don't waste your money!,"This is a horrible product. It is not elegant at all!!! It is made of Styrofoam and looked like it was falling apart the second I took it out of the box. The pillars are cardboard and look like toilet paper roles. This stand would not hold up a cake, and falls apart when you try to cut the cake."
2,A Poor Attempt at Journalism,"What should have been a tremendous book about the astonishing rise and fall of Death Row, ended up being nothing more than heresay and curse words. How on earth anyone could like Mr. Ro's writing style is totally beyond me - maybe it works in magazines - but clearly not in a 300 page book. He jumps from topic to topic, he introduces WAY too many characters with barely any flow at all and most of his info is either taken from sources who refuse to be identified or from other prewritten accounts. He repeats himself in at least 15% of the book. I had really high expectations on this book - and it fell flat on it's face. Out of the 50 or so business books I've read over the years - this one rates dead last. If you've followed Death Row over the years - you've already read at least half of this book........."
3,Ronin Ro is a very good tale-teller.,"HAVE GUN, WILL TRAVEL would have received a 10 from me for its in-detail look at Suge Knight and his empire. Although Ro provides a very vivid picture of life in the fast lane of hip-hop, I felt his book was not what it lived up to be. It seems more as if he wrote this book to say everything he COULDN'T SAY about Death Row while Suge was at large. His narrative proves to be one-sided, and all statements from people involved in Death Row have come from magazine articles. Why didn't Ro go to more reliable sources. As I'm sure Ro rushed to make this book in order to reap profits, I will say that he has shown himself to be just another gossip monger, and fails to give the reader a more neutral outlook on the tragedies that have been prevalent in the world of hip hop today. What a shame."
3,It works,This prod. really works. Tried several others that did not do the job completely but this one works. Good positive feeling when you buy a prod. and it's true to the media advertising.
4,works great,"This visor has a larger bill than I wanted, but it works great and fits well. It doesn't seem to tight or loose on my head. It fits well under or over my hair depending on how I fix my hair for the day. I wear sunglasses all the time outside, but when the sun is straight up it shines in between my glasses and my eyes. So this works great to keep that unwanted direct light out of my eyes."
2,Delorme Atlas is much better,"I used the Universal Map book for a number of years. Then one day I saw the Delorme Atlas And Gazetteer. The Delorme Atlas is way better, much better use of color, much better topographic information, hiking trail info, and easier to navigate."
2,Not very good,"I thought I waw buying decent quality, but not so. These are basically like putting a white Hanes t-shirt on your pillow."
1,Not worth it!,"I bought a pair of these cables a year ago thinking I would switch over to using eSATA. I never did upgrade my system in 2010 but last week I did and since I never bothered to return these cables I put them to work. Worked great for the first couple of days and then I couldn't get one drive to be recognized and was actually pretty unhappy with the laptop and thought that it had something to do with the new machine. After screwing around with the laptop for a while I decided to try a cable I had paid 3 times as much for, and presto, it all worked. I was somewhat incredulous that a cable could go south after a couple of days - well it has. I cannot help think the adage you get what you pay for holds true for these cables. I am about to buy another eSATA (retractable and more expensive than this rubbish) before the other one in the pair I bought also gives out on me."
3,Shaky,"The eSATA cable works just as described.It provides high speed transfers. However, I am not sure whether its the wire or damaged physical driver of the eSATA port on my external HDD, but I do not always get a stable connection. Sometimes it would work. Then at other times I would try to use it again, and the drive does not even detect.For that (over multiple drives and various eSATA cables), I only give this a 3 out of 5 stars. It works as intended, but not always 100%. I have given up on eSATA tech and am waiting for USB 3.0 to become more widely used."
2,Ok for cats and small puppies,My puppies nails got thicker and the clippers almost twisted apart cutting. Not much force. He's only 7 lbs... so that'll tell you about how big the nails were.
5,Amazing book,"To me it's very important to know the history,how and why some decisions were made , how those audio gurus changed the audio industry on movies.This book should be a must have for audio guys,specially for those who take audio seriously."
1,not compatable with HP 3210,"purchased this item when installed in 3210 Magenta, Light Mageta printer said HP Cartridge installed. When Insalling Light Cyan Printer Locked up with Ink System Fail installed HP Cartridges still Ink System Fail Junk it brought anther Printer"
2,I thought that Monsenieur Musk by Dana was big BIG RIPP OFF,I used the real Monsenieur Musk by Houbigant in the early 1980's.....thie stuff that is now made by DANA using their old name is a JOKE...it lasts about 30 seconds and smell like crap...what a ripp off.I'm gonna call amazon and see if I can send it back and get my money back!!!feel like I was really ripped off!
1,DO NOT BOTHER,"If you want a product that you need to keep shipping back for maintenance...(oh and by the way you PAY for all the costs) THIS IS IT!!And if you want a battery that lasts 20 minutes and sometimes not at all even after ""FULLY"" charged this is it! And don't get me started on the cheap buttons!!! I HATE this ipod and wish that I had never gotten it!"
1,Refurbished Product,"I purchased this product in Novembert 2008. It is now 8/2009, the ipod will not charge."
2,"Great until it breaks and you deal with ""customer service""","I am sure I don't need to go on about how great an ipod is while it works, most people know that by now. But I had an ipod which broke after 2 months. When they replace it, they don't give you a new one - they give you a ""refurbished one"" which really means an ipod from someone else which broke and is probably older than yours. The warranty only exists for 1 year from when you bought the original ipod. Now after having my second ipod for under a year, the battery completely looses it's charge in minutes. As it is just over a year since my original purchase, I am out of luck. Their entire concept of customer service is a disgrace."
2,Not to Good,"The gloves work & their ok but really small in size , not super quity. I've had the gloves a short time an they show waer spots of the fingers.A friend of mine has the ""ove glove"" an says it lots better. I guess I should of bought the real thing not a knock off."
2,Not an oyster shucking glove!,"I bought this glove since it was paired with the oyster shucking knife which I was buying ... says that it's a popular purchasing combo. This is not a suitable oyster shucking glove. The description doesn't tell you that the back of the hand part is a knit fabric. Not very practical when there's a lot of water-splashing, oyster juice sloshing, and rinsing going on. On the plus side, I didn't come close to cutting myself while shucking. On the negative side, I was starting to get prune fingers from the water soaking through the knit part of the glove and collecting in the fingers."
4,no need to spend a lot these work,Yes these gloves work. rinse them off whle chopping from veg to meat real nice with just a little dish soap. They are thick and very proffesional. I recommend if you get a new set of top knives like Victoria or something from Global ect. you get a pair of these and start useing them until handleing your new knives becomes second nature. Even the most demanding chef will find these acceptable.
3,good product but smells,"Good product but does have a strong smell. I have attempted to wash ""the smell away"", but no matter how many times I wash, it still lingers."
1,nearly worthless when used with a mandolin,"When I first received the gloves I had great doubt on whether or not these gloves would protect my fingers against the sharp blades of a mandolin. They appear to be nothing more than thin cotton knitted gloves coated with a thick rubberized coating. Sure enough, I slashed through the tip of one finger the very first time I used the gloves with a mandolin. No, I did not cut my finger but only because my gloves were longer than my finger.These gloves are not giving me the peace of mind I was hoping for when I purchased them.To be fair, the gloves are not specifically marketed toward mandolin users. It was positive reviews of mandolin users that led me to purchase them. I would feel confident enough to use these gloves for handling sharp glass or metal edges."
4,Man-sized medium,"The gloves work well with the mandolin slicer. They are, however, very large for a woman's small-sized hands. But, they are the smallest size that I could locate. It sure beats getting cut."
5,Great pair of gloves,I had bought this pair of gloves to deal with sharp things aka broken pieces of glass. They are comfortable and I feel protected.
3,Comfortable gloves but latex coating leaves sulfur smell on hands,"CUT RESISTANT GLOVES-100% KEVLAR, Heavy Weight Textured Blue Latex Coated,large, (1 pair) (Tools & Home Improvement)Gloves fit well and comfortably, but after removing had sulfur smell on hands that did not wash off easily"
3,Seriously Rocks!,"I saw some comments online about the slicer not working that well, but, I'm here to tell you it does, it seriously does!! You would have to spend significantly more to get a better slicer."
3,"Great designs, but NO mention of measurements!!",This is a great book with beautiful designs and illustrations. One thing a cross-stitcher looks for (after) he/she looks at the pictures is what the measurements of the picture will be. No where in this book is there mention of what size (in grid form) the design is or what size it would be finished in various size material. Why is this?
2,A hit or miss book,"Although some of the designs are lovely, on the whole they are nothing most people would want to spend time doing. On the other hand, the designs for the Twelve Days of Christmas are delightful as are the letters that you can stitch. Some of the santas and other people are mis-shapened and look odd, but others are very nice. It is very much a 50/50 hit or miss book."
4,those who pan this book wouldnt know good sci-fi if it .....,"to those who expected this to be ""like asimov"" give me a break! First of all Isaac was more conceptual genius then a great writer, his prose style was pretty basic stuff, his use of characterization was also primitive. Lots of sci fi writers of his generation wrote rings around him albeit with weaker concepts. Second much of the foundation series was based on incorrect or obsolete science, which had to be updated. Finally, Asimov left several important questions unanswered. These answers were the primary mission the Killer B's attempt to fullfill in this series. So those readers expecting Asimov like writing are clearly barking up the wrong tree! This book is excellent, those readers who don't like it simply don't appreciate good hard scf-fi. He fleshes out Asimovs universe and adds modern hard sci-fi concepts to it. A master of the genre has contributed a fine piece of work here."
2,"Good, but not a Foundation book by far","Halfway through Foundation's Fear, I got the sinking feeling that I had read this book before. Characters, dialogue, even the setting was ringing my deja vu alarm. Finally, I realized: the entire middle section of the book (about Ipan, for those who read it already) was also published as a short story which made it into 1997's _The Year's Best Science Fiction_. Even though the book was good, most if it gave the same impression: it felt like a collection of Benford short stories bound up and renamed ""Foundation."" How else can one explain wormholes, Voltaire, tiktoks, and a dozen other elements that never should have been in a Foundation universe? For relief, read _Foundation and Chaos_ by Greg Bear, which tosses out Benford's deviations in the first few pages and gets back to the story we were hoping to read."
4,"Foundation's Fear nothing like Asimov's style, but good.","Foundation's Fear begins with an attempt at Asimovian style but fortunately Benford abandons it early on. Nobody can pull off that kind of efficient, plain style like Asimov did. This is a very long novel in comparison to any of the Foundation books, with a sub plot that almost could have been a separate novel without depleting the wordage too much. I was dissappointed that he deviated unnecessarily from Asimov's Foundation universe in some aspects, like replacing hyperdrive with wormholes, and several other small things that I found when I reread 5 foundation books after reading this one. Still it is a very good novel. A Benford novel"
2,"Keep away, else spoil your interest dead.","After reading the foundation saga and taking great pleasure from it, my attention was drawn, whilst in a book shop, to this further trilogy promising yet more insight to Asimov's tale. What a load of guff.The book lacked the gripping story line that Asimov created, fixing you to the book for hours. Whilst the characters showed deep progression along philosophical lines, the whole thing was just very dull and killed off my want for further foundation titles.Be warned, this is not Asimov material and will not live up to any expectations."
1,Don't waste your time or money.,This was the most boring of all the Foundation's books. The Book began to get good only after reading the first 100 pages and became very boring again. I have read all of the other Foundation book written by the master himself (IA). I wish the arthur did not write the book. This was the a major disappointment!
3,Works,The griddle is not as heavy as the Pampered Chef griddle I have but it works well as a backup for less money than the Pampered Chef.
3,STi Mobile has worked okay for me.,"It's true that STI unilaterally added a three dollar a month fee to their prepaid phones. They deduct the fee automatically from your airtime balance.I got my phone for free in a package with an air time purchase. The network is Sprint PCS, so you should first check whether Sprint will work well in your area.There are deals out there for the phone and for the recharge cards, and you might want to compare other prepaid phone deals with what you can get for STI. Deals come and go, so if you don't need a phone immediately, keep watching and you probably can find a phone for free with $.10 a minute calls. Don't go for any deal until you find out whether the phone will work where you want to use it."
3,The Wicked Day by Mary Stewart,"Having read most of Mary Stewart's books, this one is a major disappointment. If you have read her Merlin Trilogy, this will be a ""light"" rehash of the engaging work in the previous books. It does give you a different look at the history in the eyes of Mordred but it is not backed by all the info and research piled in the other books."
4,More Holistic than Freud,I'm not a major student of psychonalysis or Jungian psychology but my review may be helpful for the beginner. I liked man and his symbols because it is probably the best introduction to jung. I liked it because it was so readable. I tried to read Jung's other books but (and i don't know why) they were NOT as readable. I think that this book is designed for beginners. Jung fills in a lot of gaps that I couldn't understand about people in general. Jung is also willing to go beyond what Freudian psychology would. Freud explains all neurosis as a sexual frustration. Jung takes a broader approach.It's readable and enlightening.
4,Let the Games Begin,"This book was created by a Japanese psychologist and is supposed to be a study of the mind or spirit based on solid psychological principles. I am not sure how accurate the results are but I will vouch for an entertaining experience. This book contains 53 situations all with a choice of responses and a key to what your particular response means. The idea behind the games is to reveal hidden beliefs and attitudes about love, work, relationships and other important avenues in life. You might be surprised at what you hide inside!"
5,a surprise...,"i got a surprise when one day on the old music downloading website ""audiogalaxy"" i got a message saying ""i think you might like this band named OTEP""...i kind of kept it in thought and it wanst until i saw the ""jihad"" EP in stores that i checked them out...i liked them but i wasnt floored...flash forward almost a year and i buy ""sevas tra"" anbd i have to say,it's changed my mind about the whole metal genre...i though most metal was either to whiny or to unintelligent...but otep proved me wrong...i am a poet myself and it's cool to see words on paper brought to this level of emotion...you listen to her (and ESP. on jonestown tea)and you swear you can picture everything she is talking about...you go beyond just banging your head...you actually feel it...and to me,that's the way it should always be.P.S. - this is the best album i've heard so far...ever..."
5,critic number one is wrong,"the first critic for this cd is totally wrong!!!!!! this is one of the best cd's ever. The fact that otep is combining rap and metal is what sets them apart from other hardcore bands, and actually puts them above most. They have a unique sound that should be appreciated, you can't take the rap out of there songs, without it they are just another boring hardcore band. i think the rap should stay in it, they kick ass best hardcore band ever!!!!!!"
3,Reminds me of Korn and Limp Bizkit put together,"I've given this an honest listen. This is simply for Korn fans and Limp Bizkit fans. She reminds me of Fred Durst's vocal style, of course with the exception of pitch. As for the music, it leans more toward Limp Bizkit with much darker touches, thus Korn.Now, I know many people love Korn here, why wouldn't you? But since I'm a metalhead, I deny that these guys have any instrumental skill. I'm sorry, but it just isn't interpretive music to my ears. Just music that is in the wrong direction, towards gothic nu-metal trying to sound metal, ending up being simply nu-metal with screaming. Good? NO! Bad? It's your opinion.Let the no's start rolling in, but if you're a metalhead avoid this and pick up the new Fear My Thoughts disk or The Red Death, both from America. Or just wait for the new OPETH or ARCH ENEMY or BODOM."

1,Amazon should be sued for fraud,"Would Amazon offer a book of hoaxed memoranda titled ""Surname Dataset: Secret Memoranda Detailing Amazon.com's Plan to Exterminate Mexican-Americans""?It is one thing to offer Main Kampf by Adolf Hitler. He IS the author, and should receive full credit for its contents. It is another thing to offer hoaxed ""protocols"" authored by Christians, but fraudulently attributed to ""Learned Elders of Zion.""As wrong-headed as it would be, I could tolerate this trash being sold with the Russian Mathieu Golovinski listed as his author, and the subtitle, ""Plagiarized from the 1864 satire against Napoleon III, 'The Dialogue in Hell between Machiavelli and Montesquieu' by the Frenchman Maurice Joly.""[...]"
1,Reads like the original internet troll,"Even ignoring the ridiculous ""substance"" of this ""book,"" it looks like the original 13 year old internet troll wrote it. Random caps lock for words, sentences, or even whole paragraphs. With no clear reason why that is singled out for emphasis. Incomplete sentences, sentences that are nonsensical. Meandering ""themes"" that are essentially illegible.It made both my eyes and my brain hurt."
1,Blatant Lies,"Read this book simply for the sake of gaining insight as to the degree of hatred that it represents. It is a forgery, banned in many countries. It is a magnificent tool of propaganda, the language is complex and comes across as well researched and to those who do not know any better it is a convincing piece of literature. It has been used as the tool of the anti-semite since its publication, including Adolf Hitler, and so those who disagree with me will no doubt be his loyal post-mortem supporters, thier biggotry undying and their ignorance causing irrepairable damage. To this day, web sites quote Henry Fords appraisal of the work, they fail to quote his retraction and apology to the world of Jewry. [...]"
1,Shocking,"It is shocking that any corporation would see fit to sell this book, whose pages are figuratively splattered with the blood of millions, and even more shocking that the book remains on the best-seller list, more than one year after Amazon first made it available for sale.Those who want to study its contents can do so for free: The book is available on thousands of Internet sites, many of them blatantly anti-Semitic. Readers can get also obtain an analysis of this legendary conspiracy hoax from Hadassa Ben-Itto's brilliantLie That Wouldn't Die, Stephen Eric Bronner'sRumor about the Jews, and Binjamin Segel's 1934Lie and a Libel. Like a long series of other scholarly writings on this hateful diatribe, these works debunk it entirely.Buying this book, however, merely lines the pockets of hatemongers. Please, don't do it.---Alyssa A. Lappen"
1,Forgery.,"The Protocols are a scurrilous anti-Semitic tract produced by the Russian and British secret service around 1903. Of interest mainly as a piece of forgery and plagiarism, actually put on trial in Berne in 1935. Buyer beware!"
3,Worthy introduction to this singular brand of fractured funk,"3 1/2Few bands had such a detailed synthesis of their unique sound recorded so assuredly for a debut as this first Primus studio release. While the slap-bass heavy, nasally-weird, humor-driven group powered by eternal prankster and hellbilly deluxe Claypool will always remain an acquired taste, that small agitated demographic was served up properly with FF, a consistent but sometimes repetitive release."
2,primus vinyl,I was upset to see that the left corner of the album was bent badly. So i am not happy to see this album come with out it being in mint shape.
5,i listen to this cd at LEAST twice a day at work!!!!,I've been listening to Primus and going to their concerts since the Berkley Square days. every song on this cd is perfect...Props to les and the guys for creating it... Ground Hogs Day is the best song on the cd.... it grows on you after awhile. And how many bands open their show with a nice slow mellow tune like that..none cause Primus is the only one who can pull it off....but halfway through the song the crowd gets going..my favorite cd..... .it never dissapoints no matter how many times a day i listen to it!!!
5,Must read.,"Marshall's work shows us that sanctification is essential to spiritual life and inseparable from union with Christ, that union with Christ means that justification and sanctification are inseparable, that holiness involves both the mind and soul of the believer, and that Christians must aim for spiritual holiness and balance in all of life. A biographical and theological introduction by Joel Beeke is included."
2,superb acting,A heart warming look at very personal issues that affect the actions of certain individuals. Inspiration to be more open with loved ones.
3,Video quality seems like a knocked off video,"The movie is amazing, that's why I bought it but the recording itself leaves a lot to be desired. The asian language characters cannot be turned off and overlap and sometimes cover the english subtitles (my wife is foreign and needs english subtitles to understand)."
5,Nifty Jazz Book,"I really enjoyed this book. I'm not much of jazz player, and never will be but I learned a lot from this. It's helped immeasurably by the inclusion of a CD covering all the lessons. Not quite like having a private teacher, but not far off, and a hell of lot cheaper."
4,George Burns And Gracie Allen: Company for Christmas / Christmas in Jail,"This is a Burns and Allen classic that will endure the test of time.Grand holiday entertainment, guaranteed to brighten the holiday spirit."
1,weird problem,"So I had this watch for about a year now, and a few weeks ago the I picked it up to put it on, and noticed that almost all of the numbers and little metal tick marks on the face had come loose, like the adhesive wore out. So now they're all shaking around in there, free as can be. One of the numbers with a hole in it (a 9 or a 6 or an 8 maybe) got stuck on the minute hand, which broke it.I wrote directly to Vostok a week ago, but haven't heard back from them. Disappointing, because I really liked this watch for the last year. I bought it for its 'green' attributes: stainless steel (recyclable) and automatic movement (no battery, indefinitely longevity). But now that I know it only lasts a year, its not green at all. Its raw metal at best.:( disappointing."
5,"Awesome, a rare find!","This is a great DVD, covering Propaganhi's ""Today's Empires"" songs, with a few of their older stuff. The sound recording is unusually good for punk rock. There are few funny low budget ""effects"", but overall it is money well spent."
2,Is it me or that glockenspiel gets terribly annoying after,"a while?This record clearly shows why most present-day critics dismiss progressive rock as a boring form of mannerism. Oh, Gong are gifted instrumentalists, no doubt about that but sadly they tend to be a bit... well ""boring"" (and this comes from a guy who loves experimental and ""weird stuff). Let's talk about the record: Expresso II is basically a jazz-oriented album focused on percussions (which in a ""progressive"" way means that they use everything from marimbas to glockenspiels. Sometimes you'll hear drums tough;-). The songs (I mean, ""suites) are ways too long but I guess that's just part of ""being progressive"". In all a great money-waster if you mind my opinion..."
1,Bought the set of 3 but it stopped working less than a month,"Bought the set of 3 but it stopped working less than a month. Now, I have a few boxes of the single (return period expired!) and I am hesitated to put them up. Stay away from this product."
5,Great product.,I choose this for the bathroom and it is great. No more messy soap dishes. The adhesive is very good and I haven't had any problems with this product. Would recommend it to everyone.
4,soap dispenser,This product is excellent easy to fill easy to use and easy to attach to wall if you like very good product
4,Nice,These are very nice soap dispensers. I like that you can buy a large container of soap and refill this item. Muchless expensive than the other soap dispensers on the market that you have to purchase a refill cartridge.
5,Single Dispenser - love it!,This was a little smaller than I expected but we LOVE the product!! We put it in our laundry room with soap by our utility sink. I did follow the instructions like filling it with water first to make sure it worked before hanging it up. It doesn't leek. The pump works. It's a wonderful product!!!
1,An Absolute Joke,"Take note of the other poor reviews, for they are right on the mark. What an absolute joke of a book. Congrats to the publisher for creating some good marketing copy around a solid premise - a backstage look at the lives of five different NBA players. Unfortunately, the book read more like Palmer's boring diary of being an NBA sycophant: picking up spillover chicks; the riveting drama of his hard drive crashing with his manuscript (Hello - are you a professional? can you say 'backup'? Can you say 'gmail yourself a copy of the word file'?); and most embarassingly - the glowing accounts of Palmer getting spiffed with free schwag from NBA players.Lots of stupid asides, a completely disjointed narrative, nothing whatsoever redeeming. Hopefully I just saved you a few bucks..."
4,Very good!,"I really enjoyed the story here, but am not one to like all the sex in a book. However, I couldn't put it down when I got the chance to read it!!! I did think she could have had their relationship 10 years ago more in the book. Would have had more of an intensity to me for their love. There weren't enough details on how they really felt about each other, or looked at each other while sort of working together?? I would recommend this to anyone!!!"
3,relaxing saturday cinema,"If you're fond of 'cozys,'then you are familiar with Rosemary & Thyme. The episodes that are commonly on TV are apparently from later seasons;not the first two. The supporting actors are largly 'off'on timing, talent and even their marks,in the first two seasons. Felicity and Pam though, are above average, in their roles and are the saving factors of this series. If you are interested-like me-you must have ""The Complete Collection."""
5,Rosemary and Thyme,This was recommended by my sister. I bought it and it took me a couple of days to watch the complete series. I was disappointed that there was no more to watch and will probably start over. Thanks so much.
3,ladylike,I enjoyed most of the episodes for their visual beauty and subtle feminist humor.Men lost patience with it.One of the disks was faulty.
2,Makes you go to sleep....,This is one of the duller BBC mystery shows on. It only lasted three series before it was cancelled. I can not say what was more boring. The sleepy no thrills mysteries or watching scenes where the two women would talk the subject with corny non readable dialoge.
3,Why would one want to paint earrings and make-up on the Mona Lisa?,"Why would one want to paint earrings and make-up on the Mona Lisa? That's just what Edgar has done here. Too much fluff.Maroubra bay is now just annoying. It sounds as if my kid is riding around on his tricycle ringing the bell the whole time.If you do not have a copy of the first issue, try finding it instead. It is beautiful! Mr. Froese should have left it alone."
4,Christ at the Center,"If you've never read anything that interprets Scripture typologically with a Christological center, this book will open your eyes. Larondelle lays groundwork by first linking the whole of Scripture as one book. He then lays the hermeneutical groundwork, explaining the process used in Christological interpretation. Lastly he moves through problematic scriptures and interprets many disputed passages. All the while he is directly interacting with classical dispensationalism (although some of the critiques would hold with progressives as well). Larondelle is a SDA, so I'm not sure how and why he wrote a work that really upsets the idea of the law being in effect for the Christian, but he did. For that I am thankful. He does quote Ellen G. White a few times, none of the quotes, however, did I personally disagree with. They were mostly fluff, almost a nod to the SDA. A majority of the time he interacts with solid theologians.I'd also recommend Graeme Goldsworthy's According to Plan."
5,Restoring the Gospel to Escatology,"This book is Awesome! Larondelle has exposed the greatest single flaw in dispensational theology, the failure to maintain Christ as the center of all Scripture and to take Him at His word. His Christocentric approach to Israel prophecies breaths life into the written Word and brings the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the forefront.Instead of scrabmling to the newspapers searching for shreds of evidence that prophecy is being fulfilled in the Middle East, Larondelle digs deeper into the treasure chest of God's Word to uncover evidences of fulfillment in Jesus Christ.In my opinion, it will be difficult for anyone with an open mind to read this book and maintain a belief in dispensationalism. This book is a must read for any serious student of Bible prophecy."
3,Where's the REST?,"Living out here in California, I appreciate the time and effort that went into the writing of this book. I must say while being fluent in Western Apache, there are many vital words that have been ommitted...flora and fauna, for starters. Listening to the 'elders' speak is a lot different than what is written in this book. Three stars for effort..."
2,only a try,"It is true that there are too many words missing, I suppose this is just a vocabulary to an unknown corpus of texts; it will help the Apache to learn how to spell, but a non-Apache won't learn much from it."
3,Prayers for rain,"Gong fans will kindle me, but I think this album is overrated in comparison to many other Gong efforts. It lacks exactly the structure and direction needed even in avantgarde rock projects. There are many brief tracks with incidental music, but I think all these pieces are just filler and make this album rather dull and forgettable. Besides the first two and the last three songs, there's nothing particularly interesting and exciting here. ""The other side.."" is a great space rock song with Gong's typical space whispering, high-flying synths, and droning percussion. My other favorite tracks offer quirky, rhythm-oriented prog-rock with amusing, wry lyrics. ""Angel's egg"" is potentially rewarding, but it requires many listenings before the hooks and melodies emerge. Nevertheless, if you want to have a rocky and catchy album by Daevid Allen's Gong, I recommend you to check out their excellent debut ""Camembert electrique"" (1971) and the very diverse ""Shapeshifter"" (1992)."
3,terrible packaging,"I give the book five stars, but Amazon's shipping department about two stars. The book was shrink-wrapped, but the bottom right edges of all pages were bent from bouncing around in a box that was WAY too big. Hey Jeff B. - please spend less time on Kindle and more time on quality control and customer satisfaction. Regular Amazon customers know that mine is not the first or only complaint about poor shipping practices. (And yes, the book itself is beautiful...)"
4,"looks good, but not functional","i purchase it for a CBR600RR-2007 and didnt fit the nut to adjust it, i had to cut it but now is ok.this is for competition, is not very functional i think, but the bike looks great"
5,Remarkable account of an investigation.,"Philip Ginsburg has done it again! Like Poisoned Blood, I could hardly put this book down. Shadow of Death is an in-depth look at a series of murders and the investigations in New Hampshire and Vermont in the 1980s. As I read, I experienced the frustration and the urgency of the detectives and the profiler to catch the killer (or killers). Although the murders remain unsolved, it wasn't for lack of trying. Philip Ginsburg has done a remarkable job in relating the murders, and detailing the victims, the psychologist, and the detectives, to the point where you know them well. Truly one of the best books on a serial murder investigation."
5,"WONDERFUL, WONDEFUL JOHN G BETANCOURT!!","I JUST FINISHED READING THE BOOK SHADOWS OF AMBER. LIKE ALWAYS, I'M ENTIRELY SATISFIED. IT WAS AN AMAZING BOOK, AS WERE ALL THE BOOKS IN THE DAWN OF AMBER SERIES. I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT JOHN GREGORY BETANCOURT WILL CONTINUE TO FINISH OUT THE SHADOWS OF AMBER SERIES.I HAVE READ ALL OF THE 10 BOOKS IN THE GREAT BOOK OF AMBER, BY ROGER ZELAZNY . I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS AT ALL WITH THIS BOOK, LEADING THE WAY INTO THE GREAT BOOK OF AMBER SERIES. I READ THIS BOOK IN ABOUT 2 DAYS. I LOVED EVERY BIT OF IT!! THANKS JOHN GREGORY BETANCOURT FOR YOUR AMAZING WORK! I'LL BUY ALL OF YOUR AMBER SERIES BOOKS THAT YOU DECIDE TO COME OUT WITH!!!"
4,Great Natural Lotion,"I love that it's Natural & Organic. Great for my skin & my babies. It's very inexpensive when you compare it to a 8 oz bottle for $9+ dollars at mall bath stores (where the ingredients are healthy anyways). You are getting a lot of great lotion for the cost. It smells like lemon grass. It's soft, not greasy, but my skin feels very moisturized. I will be using this for years to come."
2,mainstream,"that's not what i consider progressive rock or avantgarde.sorry guys, good luck for future release."
1,Soren for Myself,"Most people who quote Kierkegaard aren't familiar with his works in detail. From a neo-constructivist perspective, the man is the greatest pornographer of his generation. Most especially, I find all his talk about ""love"" sickening. What about the other fundamental emotions- irony, tragedy, and viscosity? Who buys this carp?"
1,I get more out of a magazine,You can tell the DVD was made on a budget in someone's basement.The item arrived with a cracked case and menu options didn'tappear to work.
5,Patty Griffin - Impossible Dream,Anything by Patty Griffin is great! She is one of the best singer songwriters in my opinion.
2,Horribly glitchy game,"I really can't believe some of the high marks some people have given this game. It glitches out so many times; at least two or three times I had to manually turn off my x-box and restart because of a glitch. Many other times I got stuck on some invisible wall. The AI is horrible and does not live up to the hype.It's not all bad - it's always fun to kill storm troopers with a lightsaber. The cutscenes look pretty, and the voice acting and music are good.This game tries to follow the God of War formula and apply it to Star Wars: slash and hack and level up with new combos. It's not a bad idea, but it's so poorly executed, you'll wish you were playing the old wire-frame x-wing game."
3,"If you liked the Jedi Knight games, you'll ""probably"" like this one","Although I haven't played through the game yet, I find it hard to do so. The game plays like the Jedi Knight games, you versus an onslaught of enemies of various difficulties (mostly pushovers). The boss battles are forgiving and repetative, you can try to fling barrels and other items into your opponent, but using your saber usually gets the job done ""much"" faster.In essence, what I'm getting at is that this game has little to no freedom. Yes, you can fling the peons across the room, and do most everything you'd like to them. But that's all...The game more or less, ends there."
4,Force Unleashed 360,"Ok, so I originally bought this game for the ps2 because it was cheaper, but found that the version was unplayable. Then I got the 360 version. The 360 version is absolutely amazing, great graphics and game play. I would have given it five stars, but there were a few draw backs. The game had quite a few glitches, I had to restart several boss battles because the game glitched out so bad. Then there were some tedious parts, namely pulling down the star destroyer, that level was so unbelievably gay that I almost quit playing the game for good. If you can get past those two points, everything else about the game is amazing."
3,screwed by Amazon,Amazon didn't even ship this out until a day after its general release ... so I got it a week after everyone else had it. That's ONE Amazon!!!
3,Another SW game that fails to deliver,The problem with this game is it doesn't have any polish to it. If you play the first level you have played all of the other levels. It tries to imitate god of war and doesn't even come close in any of the elements. How come there is a loading screen just to move around the menu? That is ridiculous. This game was pushed back a year from its original release date and I expected a lot more polished game because of it and we get a tech demo game with SW skins on top of it. The positives about this game were the background level art is amazing and using some of the force powers are fun (how come you can't move when using force grip? It makes no sense you just sit there and get blasted). Overall I was disappointed and would not recommend this game for more than a rental.
2,This game is to short to be worth 59 bucks!!!!!,"This game was good, but it was way to short. I was expecting at least 20 hours of game play, and instead got 8. Best thing to do is rent it out and just play it. Anyone could pass this game in about 8 hours or less. There is no depth once you pass it; that is it nothing special about it. Hope Knights of the old Republic makes a comeback, because that is the only star wars game (besides lego star wars) that was worth any $#@t."
2,Not fun. You feel weak the whole time. Bad Platforming.,"The platforming elements are not good.You feel like a weakling.The force throw is just about broken.It's just, not fun. Sorry."
1,Awful Game,This game played a tug and war between love and hate until finally I gave into the dark side and recognized it for what it is. It's an awful game. If you enjoy strategy and cunning this game is NOT for you. It's only the 2nd game in my 37 years that I destroyed rather than wasting one more second on it. I gave it 2 stars for fun because chucking enemies is great but one star because I hope no one else wastes their time on this. Don't waste your time on this game.
2,Dissappointed for now,"As many have already said, this game is way too short. Unless there's a ton of DLC on the way they should've charged half price. Granted its fun to play but I was through it in 2 nites. And I'm no hardcore gamer.The game should've continued at the end instead of teasing a 3rd istallment. For a game with no online play, its definitely disappointing. The only way to make it better is to introduce online play or give us a bunch of FREE DLC missions."
2,Beneath Expectations,"I don't like to criticize anything too deeply, but I feel if I don't let people know how I feel about this book, some people may make a terrible mistake. I find the myth of Atlantis intriguing. I also love reading most fact or fiction about the Arctic and Antarctic. However, I clearly expected too much out of this novel.The character development is incredibly weak. The sense of setting is okay, if even mediocre. There is no flow to the plot at all. I mean, one minute Conrad Yeats is getting slammed with a ten foot tidal wave, and the next, this tidal wave brings him out of the water onto his feet on a ledge? Suspension of reality is one thing, but this is one example of something completely different! Plus, the ending just doesn't feel right.I'm not encouraged to buy any more of this author's work, unfortunately. I truly believe this could've been much better.If you love high action and adventure in colder climates, try Matt Relly's Ice Station, or James Rollins'Ice Hunt."
2,Full of factual errors,"A C-141 Starlifter with propellors?A US Navy battle group sailing 20 miles off the east Antarctic coast in September? No way, it would be solid pack ice at that time of year, I know, I've been there."
3,I think I missed something,"I gave this book 3 stars because Mr. Greanias had the guts to write it. Otherwise, you need to walk backwards while reading. The character, Yeats, the son, was interesting until the end. But yet he wound up exactly where he started. Sister Serghetti reminded me of the Flying nun becoming a secret agent. But even she wound up where she started. I'm not sure if there is a story here or not; I thought so, until the end. Mr. Greanias did well developing the characters until the finish, then everything just fizzled. It reminded me of t.v. shows where everybody dies, but it was only a dream."
1,Over the top and unoriginal,"This book took aspects from every Dan Brown book and meshed them together into one high unbelievable and somewhat silly story. It started out alright, but once I finished I was glad to be able to throw the book on a bookshelf, hopefully never to be read again. 1) The characters weren't well developed, 2) The characters weren't likeable, 3) I felt like Greanias was copying other author's ideas, and 4) The ending was laughable and I felt a bit of embarrassment for the author.I kept wanting the book to end but every time it looked like an ending was in sight, another bad guy would show up. Had the book ended at one of those earlier ""ending-in-sight"" points, it would have been better."
1,maybe the worst book I ever read,"What a disappointment, despite all of the hype. This book supposedly based on certan facts is a mish-mosh of poorly formulated ideas, horribly unarticulated characters and gross distortion of facts. Indeed, I have to believe that the author was drunk when he wrote it. Nothing else can explain this calamity, but even more disturbing, is the fact that a major publisher agreed to issue this disaster. I guess that owes to the fact the dumbing down of America has made book publishers desperate for material. This book is a total waste of money and a disgrace to literacy. Please, give us authors who have a sense of humanity and who know how to delineate their characters and how to construct a storyline. The main character is defined early on as a deconstructionist archaelogist, but he would have to go a long way to exceed the spurious deconstructionist notions of this seriously impaired author. I this is as good as it gets, no one will ever read anything ever again."
1,4 Bad flicks,"All 4 of these movies are pretty bad. The effects are bad, the acting is bad, the story is bad, most of them have big holes in the story and jump around without explanation."
4,Neat little book,"This is a complete and compact travel journal, loaded with travel tips, space for recording absolutely everything, great packing lists for all kinds of trips. What I didn't like was the out-dated calendars (1999 and 2000) on the inside front and back covers--some help that is. I purchased four journals at once, all different, to use as gifts. This was the most expensive, and I probably would have returned it except that our trip is less than 2 weeks away!"
3,dark love story,"This is an interesting book, and although the subject matter gets pretty disturbing at times, it's written in quite a simplistic way, which makes it a quick, light read. But to me, it's definately more a dark love story than historical novel."
3,Where does fact begin and fiction end?,"The book is a quick read, but it is frustrating trying to figure out what parts are true, somewhat true or utter fiction. Was Sancha of Aragon real? Certainly Lucrezia Borgia and Cesare Borgia are real enough, and Lucrezia was briefly married to Jofre's wife's brother. After reading the book, I am more interested in finding out more about the intriguing Borgia family, that is for sure."
4,Precious!,I purchased this adorable set as a gift.It was darling! Well worth the money.The matching hat to the coat was perfect.
5,A masterpiece indeed,"I agree absolutely that this is a gem of a record. excellent songs, musicianship, and specially one of the best drum recordings i have ever heard. The sound is very good and guy evans execution is absolutely killer. Also, Hammil's voice is monumental.Highly recommended for top level progressive rock seekers."
5,Kids enjoy building these,"Besides the picture being the Word Building Puzzles II instead of I, it is a great product. The students enjoy trying to put the pictures together. With the older students I have them write the names of the pictures on a dry erase board after putting the pieces together. Then, I'll take away the pictures, and try to have the students read the words left on the board without the pictures showing. It is a great builder for emerging readers. I like this product a lot."
4,fun little pocket sized toy,its cheap and is fun to mess with when your bored. great for kids just learning or interested in music. not as high quality as a recorder but well worth the price. i was overall very happy with it.
2,Dance shoe was of poor quality,"They sent the wrong size to begin with and I had adance class coming up shortly, so I had to wear themonce, Customer service was terrible and they didnot reply to my e-mail requesting a return."
2,A book of errors with pictures,"I bought this book for a research project for school, and ended up having to redo my research. This book provides nice prohibition era photos and other such pictures, but the information is purely faulty. First off, when they were talking about Capone, they were totally off. Capone had a stand-in son who he took out in public, he never killed ""thousands of people"", and the St. Valentine's day massacre was headed by Jack McGurn, (not Jake), and involved 4 men (not 5). The rest of the magazine was the same. Also, i sensed a very biased few, they worshipped Eliot Ness and called Capone basically a brute. Maybe Life should have researched this a little before printing, eh?"
4,A Very Rewarding Comedy,"John Landis has done it again with this very intelligent comedy gem. Eddie Murphy gives a very good comic performance as a down-on-his-luck street hustler who gets the opportunity to ""trade places"" with Wall Street snoot Dan Aykroyd. Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche both do very well as two greedy, self-centered stock market moguls, who think that just because they have money they can tinker with people's lives. The whole cast does very well with this material. Especially, Jamie Lee Curtis, who delivers a very sexy performance as a hooker with a heart.If you enjoy this movie and would like to see what happened to Bellamy and Ameche's characters later on in life, be sure to check out ""Coming To America"" which also stars Eddie Murphy and was also directed by Landis."
5,"Great, but a small watchout","This a great comedy. It has a good story and many key, funny scenes. The R rating is due to on quick flash of nudity and a handful of bad language."
1,This DVD will not play on most DVD players sold in the US.,I overlooked that this disc doesn't play on most players in the US.The seller knew this disc was being mailed to the US. It would have been nice if the seller had notified me of this and given me a chance to remove the purchase. It would also have been nice if they had sent a disc that could be played in the US. But nothing like this happened.I gave this a one star in hopes that this important issue be brought to the attention of potential buyers.
5,It was the Duke's ... It was the Duke's,Another classic from Eddie Murphy. He and Dan Akroyd were so great together. They should have done more together. Really funny pair.
4,mildly entertaining,"This book is a fast read and keeps your attention. I enjoyed the authors viewpoint on how recent history progressed as it did. I have not read the author's first two books ""Wall Street Meat"" and ""Running Money"", but from the reviews they are much different than this book, and have a lot to offer. He grabbed my attention, so I will add the other books to my wish list."
5,Jesus the Christ,Jesus the Christ is the most powerful book outside of scripture that I have read. James Talmage makes the content understandable and does a great job describing previously hard to understand concepts from the life of Jesus Christ. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the ministry of Jesus Christ.
5,Better than Ajax anyday,This is the absolute best ever sink scrub. It has a wonderful lavender scent. It actually makes you feel good when you're cleaning. Please Amazon bring it back!!!
3,a lot of quotes...,"Basically this book is a collection of quotes lifted from secondary sources. The authors then take them and write about entrepeneurship trying to extract the key concepts.I was not excited about the purchase although I imagine if you have limited experience in this area, you will gain some benefit.I am an active angel investor and previously ran companies in both the USA and England."
2,please put original on cd,"this is a remake of original cd. the sound quality is not that good. i'll purchase the greatest hits but it doesn't have the song ""it'll shine when it shines"" on it. now that i think about it this cd doesn't have the song ""e.e. lawson"" on it either. oh well, please put the original on cd that's all i can say."
2,Yawn,If you like Jane Austen you will probably be a fan of this book. Though the pace of the book was certainly faster than Austen I found the book rather boring and predictable.
1,Mainwaring shouldn't have done it!,"I loved The Buccaneers until I ran into Mainwaring's contribution, the last 12 chapters. That was like hitting a brick wall going 60 mph! As E.A. Solinas says, ""The problem is that Marion Mainwaring doesn't write like Wharton,"" and it is horribly evident when Mainwaring takes over.Not only is the tone all wrong, but there are horrible gaffs such as when Mainwaring characterizes Mrs. Closson as ""an obelisk on the banks of the Hudson."" Obelisk!!! Really? Is Mrs. Closson really ""a stone pillar having a rectangular cross section tapering towards a pyramidal top""? Or is Mainwaring confused with ""odalisque""? Don't believe me? Try the ""Look Inside"" function with the Penguin edition and search for 'obelisk' --there it is at the bottom of p. 327!!This really was a shameless attempt to ride Scorsese's Age of Innocence coattails, wasn't it? Better to have left well enough alone, providing the reader with Wharton's synopsis of the remainder of the book."
4,Good product for the money,The Motorola H500 Bluetooth is a good buy and functions pretty well. I will admit that this is the only one that I have had however I was comparing it to a different brand that was more money owned by my 22 year old Grandson. His didn't work that well and he paid more for it. This product arrived on time and was well packed. The performance is good. The only drawback is the voice activated calling sometimes takes more than one try to get it done. For the money I believe that it is a good product.
2,Not so great,"I brought it for my friend, the first one we got was terrible, But Amazon's cu care is excellent. They easily replaced it with a new one for us. But then that was a lil crappy too. The sound quality aint really good"
3,Not that hot,It okay for a not so busy important person someone who really just don't want a cord to tag along but as far as the use It much to difficult to use like turning up the volumn or mute or any of it functions using the features is a little annoying and it not ear easy meaning it comes off just as easy as it put on which mean if you laying back or doing head movement it just might slip off and the the talk time is not all what they say you might get just really 3 hours of talk time so it not for real talkers other then that it is a ok
1,Echo... Echo... Echo...,"When using the headset, I get constant complaints from people on the other end that they hear an echo. The echo goes away if I turn down the volume to a such a low level, I cannot hear. I suspect the problem is related to the unit not being very secure to the ear. The unit constantly flips away from the ear. The gap allows sound to feedback from the speaker into the microphone. It also almost falls off my ear constantly. When on a call, I often find myself holding it close to my ear to keep it from falling off. It has become so annoyingly loose, that I quit using it."
3,Very good.,"Just giving 3 stars because, even though the product works very well, I got the wrong cable to charge the bluetooth device, I had to buy one."
1,i got screwed,"The product doesn't work. there is so much static that comes out no one can hear me speak. when I called customer service they did not speak english and were of no help. they refused to replace it, but that could be because no one spoke or understood english. I was very disappointed in the blue tooth. and the service. I have had one for years and mine finally gave way. replaceing it was not a problem I wanted the same one i had ... that was a mistake...thanks for asking my opinion.. hope you post it"
2,"Nice looking, falls short.","Quickly:Pros - Compact, long battery life, good looking design with pretty, flashy blue light.Cons - Does not hug the ear welll and may very well fall whenever you move your head any faster than a casual scan to the sides (such as, say, looking the other way to check for oncoming traffic). Does not fit very well in the ear and thus, even at max volume, one has trouble listening to the other person if they do anything other than talk loudly and clearly into the phone. Although it seems to do a good job ignoring ambient noise, it does the same thing with your voice. One must speak at a very loud volume for the people on the other end of the line to hear you clearly, thus making it useless anywhere other than your own home, car, or desserted ally."
4,Used with TRENDnet Bluetooth USB Adapter,"The Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset was easy to setup, and pair with my Blackberry phone, and my laptop. When fully charged it can last all day, which is very useful as I use it for receiving and making Skype calls. There does seem to be noise on the connection, when used with my TRENDnet Bluetooth USB Adapter, but I suspect this is the adapter and not the headset, because I don't get the same noise when I use it with my Blackberry."
3,How do you use this thing?!!!!,"Can't figure it out! It beeps and1 - the pretty blue light goes away - Is it on a ""screensaver"" mode?2 - Did that beep mean needs charge? Color stays the same then it dies :-(3 - A call is coming in, press button nothing, press longer - turns off - Aargh! call went to voicemail.4 - Pick up a call....It's disconnected from the phone!!! How did that happen?This device seems awkward on the ear and I really haven't figured out all it's function so I am going back to the manual. On a very good note - when I get it going - quality sound! That's why I bought it in the first place! Yippee!Overall I think if the blue light could turn different simple 2 - 3 colors like red when needs a charge or yellow on stand by - It would be a 5+!"
5,Excellent product,I have 5 months with my Bluetooth Headset and i think is an excellent product. I use it to speak with my cell phone and Computer (MSN and Skype) and it works perfectly. The sound is great and the mic too. Recommended 100%
4,Bluetooth Headset,The Motorola H500 is a very good unit. It has excellent sound quality and is easy to operate. The only negative thing is it does hurt the ear after wearing it for awhile.
1,Works about half the time,"The purchase was not a good one. My set works about half the time, if that."
4,"Works, but with some quirks","Works as expected. It sync'd with my phone easily. Set up is a snap. Instructions were good. Sound quality is good. Fit my ear well.Only thing keeping my rating from 5 stars is some periodic issues connecting on the first power one (sometimes takes two), and an occasional delay in pressing the button and picking up a call. Can be annoying as I've pressed twice thinking it didn't pick up initially, only to disconnect the caller when both presses are recognized."
2,Terrible outgoing voice,"The incoming sound quality is fine. However, as many have experienced, this headset has terrible outgoing sound quality. I tried it with Skype with a PC and Audiovox ST5600. The main issue is the very noticable static heard on the receiving end. I am going to return mine."
3,Almost but not quite,"I don't use the H500 much but when I need it it's not loud enough, it breaks up, and is somewhat confusing to turn on and off. Overall I would pay the extra $3-$5 for the HS850 on Amazon."
3,Mic is not as good as I thought,"It's ok. You have to talk kind of loud in order for other people to hear you very clearly.After some people kept telling me that they could hear me, I quit using it.After all, it's a good one."
2,Complaint,The product did not function the first timeso I sent it back to Motorola with the charger and handbook but they did not return the charger.Now I call everyday to get my charger back.Again the bluetooth has the same problem. It sometimes does not ring while incoming call.
5,Motorola H500,Great product! I love being able to talk on the phone while doing something else. Not just for driving!
3,Average bluetooth headset...,Beware.. there's a lot of fake H500 headsets out there...try google searching the guide to spot counterfeit ones...
5,great bluetooth for the $,I bought one of these a few months ago because I hadn't found a wired headset that I liked. I was sold on it as soon as I got it and recently purchased one for my wife.
1,Not worth the trouble,"I was very happy with the appearance and size of the headset - but very unhappy with the performance. When using it, it never feels like it is secure. It just hangs off the ear, and everytime I'd turn my head to the side or bend down to pick something up, I felt like it would fall off. The sound quality was just okay on my end of the phone (I have a Verizon LG VX8600). But everyone I called said that they heard their voices echo and the sound was muffled. In fact, one of my friends refused to even speak to me when I was using it - the sound was that bad on his end. Several times I had to turn it off in the middle of business calls because they couldn't make out what I was saying. It ended up to be pretty useless. I exchanged it for a Plantronics Voyager 510 - it is a little bigger but I've been told that the sound quality is 100% better on their end and it's also better on my end.Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint Technology [Retail Packaged]"
1,Blue Harbour Can't Be Trusted!!,"I ordered this product from Blue Harbour and asked if they shipped to Post Office Boxs. They assured me that they did. The idiots shipped by Fedex and I never received the order as it was returned to them by Fedex. To add insult to injury Blue Harbour charged me over $20.00 for the order being returned to them.So I ended up not receiving my order of two(2) head pieces but also being charged for one,plus the shipping."
3,14k sim. diamond cross,"I think the chain is too small for the cross, but otherwise I am happy with it."
1,unbelivable storyline,"i must have read a different book than all the other reviewers. the most atrocious plotting i have read in a while, bordering on the the ridiculous and improbable. it was maddening to read it and i skimmed through it so quickly that i have almost forgotten how bad this was."
3,Ok but certainly Not worthy of five stars!,"I'm sad to say this DVD is entertaining but that's about it. It's also really short! I was expecting something a little more educational. There are 5 songs, 1 about Zoe knowing how to spell her name (in English), 2 about family (nice but they are completely in English and neither reinforce the word mishpaca ""Family"" that was just introduced), 1 about the number 2 (again it doesn't reinforce the Hebrew word for two that was just introduced) and a token Alif Bet song. Only one out of 5 was very disappointing for me. It felt like they barrowed songs they already had from other programs. There is a good special feature that goes through the Alif Bet and gives three Hebrew words for each letter with a picture of each object. Over all my kids (one and a half and almost three)really like the DVD."
4,Good movie,I like both of the movies and to get it all in one deal is pretty amazing. Love Denzel and a good price!
3,Not as sweet as local no-calorie sweetener,"This was about half as cheap as buying a local no-calorie sweetener which contains rebiana (stevia) & erythritol, but I have to use AT LEAST twice as much of this to get the same degree of sweetness."
3,The Littlest Angel...,"I remembered this made for tv movie from my childhood and was surprised it was available on dvd. The quality wasn't very good... but then, it was made in the late 60's or early 70's. Still, the story was sweet, and it was nice to see an old memory come to life."
5,Ignore the bad reviews! This movie is VERY old. Its worth every penny though!,"My mom told me about this show when I was just a little boy. We watched it together a long time ago and I immediately liked it. The age of the movie is noticeable as you are watching it, but the message is very powerful. If you watch movies and truly respect the messages you get out of them (also if you believe in Him) you will love this movie!"
4,"The Original ""Littlest Angel""","I remember watching this movie the year it came out at Christmas, and anticipated it the following year, but it was never shown again. I have been searching for 31 years and would love to have this movie for my children to see. They have heard me talk about it for 10 years. Please release this movie again. I will be the first to purchase it. Thank you."
5,The Littlest Angel should be released for sale again,This is probably one of the most beautiful stories of the first Christmas and brings back such fond memories of childhood. Please help to get this video released again. It should be available to be shared with every generation.
4,Nostalgia,"This is a great bit of nostalgia for the forty-somethings out there who still remember those holiday programs that came on only once a year. For me and my family the Halmark Hall of Fame presentation of ""The Littlest Angel"" was as looked forward to as Charlie Brown and Rudolf. The special effects are dated but this production has heart. It's something for me to enjoy with the grandkids when they come for a visit."
4,Great lotion,"I love this lotion for my extra dry skin. I gave four stars because it states that it ""helps heal and protect extra-dry skin"". I have been using this lotion for months now and I do not feel like any healing has taken place. It moisturizes my skin for the day or my hands in between washes. Nevertheless, it is a great lotion option for regular use - just do not expect healing as this product claims."
5,"Excellent lotion, non-greasy","After just a few minutes of applying, this lotion is almost unnoticeable. I don't get that greasy feeling, nor does it feel too watery like some lotions. It does a very good job of relieving dry skin."
5,"Fast-paced, fun, loved the characters!","I would give this book 6 stars if I could. I guess it comes down to what a person likes in a romance in their particular mood. Generally I happen to love spunky heroines, well-grounded heroes and a fast-paced, suspenseful adventure story with humor. I liked the characters even more as the story went along which is a very good sign. There was eventually some sex but it wasn't overdone or underdone. Just a rolicking good story with good romance and no slow periods anywhere. The perfect escape novel."
5,Absolutly Spectacular,"Picking up this book, I'll admit, I was a bit skepticle. My doubts were erased before I finished the first page. I just finished the book an it is one of my favorites. The story and the writing style are nothing short of perfection. I would recommand this book to anyone who asked as well as those who didn't."
4,A book worth reading - do yourself a favour and enjoy it.,This is a well-written book that I enjoyed a great deal. The start and finish of the book are excellent. The characters are full of life and the I got deeply involved with their lives. One drawback to this book is the length of time spent describing the camp life of the main characters. The other drawback is I never really got to know the main villain. In fact the only time the book involves the villain is at the finish. More involvement from the villain would have made this book something special.
4,Excellent Beginning,this is an excellent tale that tells us the how and why of the mage wars and sets up heroes that we have already heard about. A must read for any valdemar fan.
5,The best book I've ever read,What I think makes this story good is the unique style of writing.The best way to describe it is a fantasy/mystery/where you fill in the blanks for the rest of the plot.
3,Edited,"Although I have enjoyed Cheech and Chong's comedy for years, this CD has been edited from what it should have been. I still have the cassette version and was looking forward to the CD with higher sound quality, but instead got an abridgement of each track. What makes Cheech and Chong fun to listen to is their unrestrained humor and this holds back too much in my opinion."
1,"big dissappointment, man...","WARNING! Anybody who's seen ""up in smoke"" and thinks ""hey, lets get some more of that excellent entertainment"" - well, think again. Get Out Of My Room is poor, to say the least. Not a single decent joke, no creativity, no running-gags...."
3,Bass laiden speedgarage for the hardcore fans.,"OK, yes its SPEEDGARAGE. Yes, the tracks are bass laiden. THIS IS IT by State of Mind is bumpin'! Another Big Room album, try playing this on a tiny sound system, and you'll find the tracks monotonous. How to crystallize this album? Deep, hard SPEEDGARAGE, solid production values, boomin' bass. The better tracks include IT'S YOUR LOVE (Banana Republic Remix). Latch on to the vocals and ride the groove! Oh, Oh, Oh! Sima's GIVE YOU MYSELF is the BOMB! ""Its like walkin' on the moon . . . I'll always be around . . . Now that I found . . . YOU!"" Track 12 starts out tight with sub-bass but 2 minutes in, monotony sets in. Overall, an album worth purchasing for the true SPEEDGARAGE heads, but I wouldn't buy this for an introductory taste of the genre."
1,Don't waste your money,I wanted so much to love these but no dice. The suspenders are not adjustable so you are stuck with the prescribed length and the clasp broke after 4 wearings. Don't bother and buy some full suspenders.
2,"Great idea, badly made","After wearing this for 2 hours, yes 2 hours, the clasp broke and fell apart. I am trying to contact the company to get a refund. It's a great idea, but I must have gotten a defective product. Also, they are not adjustable, I think they would have been better if they could be adjusted."
3,"Better than #13, worse than any","i didn't like this one too much either i mean seriously what is cornelia's problem? sulking is like one of her hobbies now. and even though combining the aurameres affected the rest of the series(im refering to nerissa's revenge and all that)it doesn't really make any sense. so don't buy #13, 14, or 15"
4,"A little harsh on the hands, but otherwise good.","Very strong smell, doesn't take much to get the job done and leave the entire bathroom smelling like lavender. Kind of harsh on my hands, but lotion helped and a lot of other soaps have been harsher.Overall, good. No problems with leaking or delivery. Oh, but to get the pumps working I had to pull off the top and then stick it back on, for a few of the bottles at least. (I've had to do this with other things before, so maybe it's normal?)As a side note, if you wash your hands for the full 20 seconds (four deep breaths), that's supposed to be just as good as antibacterial handsoap, without any of the chemicals."
3,"Difficult to apply, but works well once applied...","I agree with the previous review. I applied the ShieldZone Invisible shield to a Motorola Razr V3 cell phone and it was quite difficult and messy. The shield is durable and looks good when applied, but it catches dust very easily and it's difficult to fix if applied incorrectly.You need an absolute dust-free environment for application as well clean hands. It takes about 40-60 minutes to install properly, but be familiar with how you are going to do it. Review the instructional video at the shieldzone website, and have your procedure rehearsed in your mind before beginning, because if you apply it incorrectly it sets relatively quickly and is hard to reset.Thinking back, a less durable but more pliable plastic shield might work just as good for short term protection, though in the long-run this is better (if applied correctly.)"
2,Not really that helpful...,"I didn't find this book helpful in terms of ""revealing"" anything enlightening. I especially don't think men would like it - it has a strong female slant, seems primarily applicable to females, and to females in rough spots - the author talks a lot about her prior experience married to an addict, and how women who are content to smile and nod should break out of their shackles (in so many words). Perhaps this book is beneficial to women suffering from a lack of self-confidence, or women in really unhealthy relationships, but I think people who are just seeking better communication skills or general improvement for their relationships won't benefit from this book. Almost half of the book was ""questions you should ask each other,"" which I also didn't find helpful. Wouldn't recommend this book to others; there are definitely better ones out there. I think part of this woman's fame and hype is the result of her connection with Oprah."
4,Very good.,"All in all, I really enjoyed this book, as it brought home the truth about marridge, and what we're really commiting to when we say those sacred wedding vowes. The truth in my opinion is that you are commiting to just more than love, and enternal life together, than we let ourselfes in for, and this illustrates this in this fascinating, book, that really tells you the truth about marridge, with self expeirences and other peoples problems, Smith really brings it home in a truly amazing way.Sam Worrall rating: 4 stars"
4,"a good, enlightening read","I'm currently engaged and eager for all the advice and wisdom that I can get. I'll admit, I bought this book mainly because I'm a big Oprah fan, and any friend of Oprah's is a friend of mine.I found the book to be pretty inspiring-- particularily the chapter on the importance of vows. The worksheets were helpful and made me really think about my values and views in a way that I hadn't quite done ever with my fiance.My only complaint is that I found the book a little.. negative towards husbands. Whenever Dr. Smith recants a story about a marriage gone wrong, the husband was always the do-wronger. I found it to be quite exhausting.That one issue aside, I did find it to a worth while read and would recommend it."
3,lid organizer,"A pretty good lid organizer. A bit inconvenient if you want to remove the middle lid. The handles on the lids can ""get stuck"" on each other. However, easy to find a lid, and no more digging thru a junky cupboard. I would recommend this lid organizer as an inexpensive, fairly convenient kitchen tool. thank you."
5,Follow the book and you will see amazing things!!!,"What a book!!! I purchased this book prior to going to Kauai in December 2003. Did my reading/research and thanks to the Malinoski's found some excellent snorkeling locations. I only wish there was more vacation time to hit every spot listed within the book.My brother and I snorkeled one location (which was listed within the book) and swam with several green sea turtles. It was amazing!!! If you do the same, remember that you CANNOT harass or even touch the turtles. They are protected by Hawaiian law, as are the monk seals (sea lions).I just bought the Malinowski's book for snorkeling Maui. I hope to visit Maui this Christmas and see more amazing underwater sights. (one tip of advice: purchase a good underwater digital camera -OR- a disposable underwater camera (Fuji or Kodak, $8-10 at Walmart) for your snorkeling adventures. You'll find plenty of fish, coral and other underwater life to photograph)."
4,Women have it rough.,"I am a man with a capital M and I liked the book. Holcomb has balls for laying it all on the table. In this day of Lewinskis and Wonder Bras, it is good to know that feminists aren't hiding."
2,Author's chance to vent her outrage and little else,"I am a working mom, and had to put this down after struggling through 100 pages or so. I was looking for a careful, respectful, reasonable analysis of the effects, if any, of working moms on children. What I got was an angry book of the author's outrage at various messages sent to working moms and college age women about ""sacrifices"". She does have a point that the debate about whether or not two income families hurt kids has been mostly conducted without real research and facts. Unfortunately, she just seems to add to this. I bought this because one editorial review said that she did include research results. If she did, I couldn't find them in the first 100 pages, and lost the ability to wade through her anger to get to any later ones."
2,Author Assumes that women are all victims,Ms. Holcomb uses an age old tactic of blaming others for one's own moral and ethical dilemmas. Women who choose to have children are being told that they are victims and that ALL men seek to dominate and restrict them. All of this is presented in a series of disjointed chapters.
2,Malawi bedding set,"I ordered this bedding set for my son, I hate it. It is very cute, but when I washed it, it got faded and fell apart. This set is not worth your money.........."
5,Love The Whole Collection,I bought everything Malawi; from the bedding to the switch plate cover. and my baby boy's room looks beautiful!
3,cute,i got this set for my baby girl....we knew we were having a girl but just in case we got this malawi set that is either for a boy or girl. it's adorable....the valance and the anilmals...but the bumper DOES NOT FIT our crib which is a rigazzi crib. we can't return the crib nor the bedding so we're stuck with it looking abnormal. make sure you get this if you have an extra large crib.
1,Dont do it,"This album is horrible. I LOVED the first Blue Murder cd so I was thrilled to find this one. Big mistake, how a band makes such a great first cd and such a poor second one is a mystery. This is nothing like ""Blue Murder"". It is sappy, lacking any good grooves and is produced badly.I should have thrown the money in the street instead of buying this cd, I think I will use it as a coaster."
4,Poetic Vignettes,"The book starts off with essays on various aspects of Indian poetry, particularly the different motifs used by poets writing in particular languages. The essays are a bit dry, but they are important for interpreting the poetry if you have not had any other background on Indic poetry.The poems are grouped by speaker/audience of the poem, which is helpful thematically, but is confusing when flipping between the poems and the various essays depending on which language the poem is written in. My favorites were generally the Tamil poems, which had very precise symbolic meanings attached to various aspects of nature."
4,Plot? What Plot?,"If you're looking for an amazing story line, incredible inferences into the state of nature and the human mind, or a thoughtful read to expand your mind-- you've come to the wrong book. If, on the other hand, you want pure, raunchy, unadulterated crude sex, you've got it. Every kink from analingus to water sports is covered in incredible detail in page-after-page of this book. This book pushes the limit, describing in hot detail the adventures of knock-out Crystal in child abuse, lesbian sex, relations with her high school English teacher and with her psychic psychiatrist boss (who claims to be a Russian spy). This book will never be a classic of English literature. It was simply not intended to be. It was written to turn you on and push your mental sexual limits, and I've got to tell you-- it does!"
4,JPLS - Twilite,"When you see the label M_nus, you already know what to expect: cool, driving minimalism, and JPLS' TWILITE delivers just that. ""Twilite 1"" has some watery synths gurgling over the beat, while ""Twilite 8"" has an industrial twinge droning through every once in a while. True to its name, the album always seems on the cusp of darkness. ""Green 01 (Skoozbot's Twilite Remix)"" adds some bounce into the mix, and ""Twilite 6.1"" has a clattery accompaniment, as opposed to the more spare opening tracks. Indeed, as the album continues, the sound grows increasingly full. ""Twilite 4"" gets slightly wobbly, and Skoozboy comes back for a remix of ""Twilite 1"" that whirls and tweets like a spinning canary. ""Twilite 6.2"" sounds like a robotic ballerina on the fritz, and ""Twilite 9"" takes the album out on a rather abrupt edit. A matter of subtraction, I guess."
3,Hurrah for Claude,"Similar to some of you, this was my first reading of a Willa Cather novel and I discovered that her story was so detailed - in its descriptions of the cornfields of the midwest to war-torn Europe - that it felt as though I were a part of her story. From college student to unassured farmer to lonely husband to war hero, I sympathized with Claude's struggle to find meaning in his life. I especially ached when Claude's father snatched away his hope to finish College and when Claude realized - all too late - that he could have had a more satisfying life with Gladys Farmer than the overly-zealous and yet selfish, Enid Royce. The book did drag in its final section, ""Bidding the Eagles of the West Fly On,"" but from this novel, one learns that - in life - a man will ultimately discover his destiny and in that, his true identity."
4,First read on kindle,"This was my first book on kindle. The story is well told without being sentimental, a rarity for this time period as far as I can recall. Wills Cather did win an award as a result.Mrscottad@comcast"
2,Wrong size shipped,"The seller sent me the wrong size. The jeans look very comfortable and warm, but when I tried to get the right size they did not have it anymore."
4,Nice Thick Jean,"These are really nice Jeans.I would like to recommend that you order at least1-2 sizes up on the waist of this Jean. The Thermal is so thick, inside the Jean, that your regular size won't fit.Wish Amazon would lower the price on these Jeans.Well Known Chainstore has them for less Money.I found that out after i bought 2 pairs.1 Pair didnt fit the person they were bought for.Because they were opened, I couldnt return them,Or so I don't think so??That's what the return Paper said.Lucky,I found someone to use them.I would have given this product 5 Stars But because of The Fit being off,Price Higher and the return policy.I gave it 4I probably won't order clothing again,But Next Yr I will buy Most of my Gifts from amazon. (Except Clothing) Stress Free Shopping is for me."
4,run small,"Quality excellent, shipping fast. However, the pair received was too small. I'm ordering again, but a size bigger than normal (maybe this is only true in X-large sizes, ordered a 46W, now ordering 48)."
2,a strong bite to this one!,This is a really strong medicinal-smelling product. I almost was overcome when I prised the can lid off. It feels good in the bath but I was not looking for such an odor....kind of puts me off my bath.
1,Terrible DVD!!!,"The film is a lot of fun, but the DVD is beyond terrible. It looks and sounds as if someone projected it onto a wall and shot that image off the wall for this DVD. Horrible, horrible quality!!! Not even worth the $.78 that it's selling for used. The producers of this garbage DVD should be ashamed of themselves. They're obviously trying to make a quick buck with no regard whatsoever for quality."
3,Not Complete,This is a wonderful book. As a lover of Fairy Tales I was excited to discover this book. However 3 of the best stories are missing from this Kindle selection. I recommend the paperback copy from Yesterday's Classics also available on Amazon. Although not free a fair price for a complete book with a really nice preface about this interesting author.
3,pretty cool book!,this book was pretty cool.It wasnt one of R.L. Stines best but it was good.If you like this book read Night in Werewolf Woods.
3,Big but breaks,"I had this juicer for about a month before the plastic pin that held it together snapped, rendering it useless.Still, it was a good size to squeeze even big lemons"
3,"It's useful, but . . . .","I can't quite give it the rave reviews that other readers have given, but it is probably the best book currently available on the subject. It does have quite a bit of useful information, though I didn't find it all that well organized and the author even repeats himself in places. I would have loved more detailed information on the trains themselves (from a passenger's perspective) and some illustrations if not photos. The author seems overly preoccupied with alcoholic beverages and I found his frequent references to the subject annoying. His few recommendations for accomodations were somewhat bizarre: five star hotels and low-budget places with almost nothing in-between. I'm not quite sure why he bothered with any."
5,Great service and product,The book arrived quickly and the book was in perfect shape. The price was 1 cent and I thought it was the best deal out there. I will definitely use this supplier again in the future!
2,smoke one two or three,once again Smoke is off to help a friend. This time its to help his friend monte recover his kidnapped wife. Once again mr johnstone starts out fine with his character but uses too many flash backs it seems like hes writing too much or something and had to have many fill in flashbacks. Since lamour died he has been one of my favortie writers but im starting to get away from his series books and going for his new character books.
4,The very misunderstood bully,"This book occurs in the same timeframe as ""A Dog on Barkham Street"". It is how Martin Hastings, the bully in both books, sees life. At the beginning of the book, Martin was being his ususal ""bully"" self and then he starts to shape up. Towards the end of the book I realized he was just misunderstood. It is a good book to see how a bully feels. You should read this book"
2,Really Torked it's Copy Protected,"There are zillions of people out there like me who don't upload songs on peer sites for stealing. But we do like to Rip them for addition to a mix disc ... in my case, for the car. So instead of listening to the new B sides on this disc a thousand times, I will listen to them zero and be ticked at Coldplay forever."
1,Poor Quality,It shrank horribly. It also wrinkles very easily. Over priced and poor quality if you ask me.
1,Not pleased,"This sheet is more ""fitted"" than the one that came with the Malawi six piece set, so it has ripped along 2 corners. I am very disappointed because this sheet was more expensive than most. My advice would be to buy a matching solid sheet and save the money."
2,Gong - 'Shamal' (Caroline),"Originally released in 1976,after both Daevid Allen and Gilli Smyth had jumped the mother Gongship,drummer Pierre Moerlen(R.I.P.)had virtually taken over the band.This CD reissue simply didn't do much for me,however four(4)of these tracks are performed live on the 2005 archive release Gong-'Live In Sherwood Forest,1975'(see my review)where guitarist Steve Hillage rejoins the the cosmic clan for a brief tour.Those four cuts are ""Wingful Of Eyes"",""Chandra"",the semi-trippin' ""Cat In Clark's Shoes"" and the jazzy title track ""Shamal"".Pretty much for Gong completists."
5,great stuff,mavelous darling... christopher guest in some of his funniest moments on snl. i don't know many people who can stretch their characters like him
1,Simply a copy,"If you ask me Will from W.I.T.C.H. is a copy of Elite 4 Will. Why? Same name, same hairstyle and Elite 4 Will is also a psychic. Enough for me. the grahics are OK. I've tried drawing myself and it isn't easy.Pokemaniac"
2,DONT get TRICKED into buyin' TRICK DADDY,"ONLY GOOD SONGS ARE ""LET'S GO"", ""THE CHILDREN's SONG"",""MANAGE A TROIS"" AND ""THUGS ABOUT"" , but the BEST BEST TRACK IS.... ""SUGAR (GIMME SOME)"" ft. Ludacris & Cee-lo. It's ridikulous. I'm glad i bought this album, just fo luda's verse! thats how hot it is. The reason this LP didnt get a lot of stars is because there's a lot of annoying tracks wit wack beats and lyrics but i expected to only get like 5 hot tracks anywayz. P.S- track 10 (skit) is teh funiest skit i ever heard. Its one dude actin like a grandma and a young hoe LOL, its still worth checkin out."
1,garbage! waste of the 88 cents i paid at allofmp3,"this album is not interesting, brings nothing new to the rap world, has mentally retarded lyrics most of which are not thuggish or gangsterish but plain stupid. if you are looking for real thug music, check out project pat. this is absolute trash"
3,The ghost was the best part of this book,"The book seemed to change focus partway through. It started out focusing on the heroine running away, and how Robert distrusted all English. Suddenly, that's dropped for a boring discription of how Mereli is in charge of the Douglas household (with pages and pages discribing her cleaning). We don't see why Robert stops disliking her. Personally, I though she had more chemistry with the ghost, Huge, and even Philip than Robert. Much of the dialogue was flat, sounding more like something written than said."
1,These bags are NOT clear!,"Unlike the picture on the Amazon website, these bags are NOT clear. They are white frosted bags. The outside of the box that they came shipped in also says they are clear. As a result, these bags can not be used in jurisdictions that require that recycled waste, newspapers, etc., must be in clear plastic bags. You can not see through these bags. These bags are being returned. This is the second time this has happened, but with a different vendor. I don't understand how some vendors can market and advertise an item without first examining the item. This results in wasted shipping costs and wasted time."
2,They Refuse to Eat It,Both of my fifteen year old cats refuse to eat the tablets and they are too big to force them to swallow the tablets. These are really more the size for a larger dog.
1,Faulty Cartridge,I have purchased several cartridges from different vendors and I have never been dissatisfied before. This cartridge leaks ink and made a mess in my printer. Now all my prints are coming out with a shadow.
2,Don't let the title fool you.,"The recipes in this cookbook aren't simple, nor would I call this ""home cooking."" The ingredients required for some of these recipes are diverse and very, very gourmet-oriented. Truffle oil is often mentioned, for example. This is not to say that the recipes are bad, but if you're looking for easy, simple recipes, this is not the book to be buying."
3,Disappointing,After reading all the positive reviews of this book I had high hopes. I've made a number of the recipes from this book and they have all produced mediocre results or been failures. This seems to be the fault of the recipes as I usually have great success with baking. I would recommend Beatrice Ojakangas's baking books as much better alternatives to this one.
2,Not for the Vegan Baker,"First, this looks to be an excellent book -- if -- you eat eggs and dairy. If you follow a plant based diet, this is not the book for you. There are handful - count maybe 5 - recipes that don't have eggs and dairy. It is possible to substitute Earth Balance for butter and tinker with egg replacers for the eggs, if you want to bother. For some reason I thought that because it has Buddhist roots it would lean more heavily on plant-based baking."
5,Tassajara Bread Book,"I was first given this book many years ago. Just recently saw that there was a new printing with a hard cover. It is a 'bible' for those who like to make their own breads, rolls etc. Clear instructions with explanations as to why things are done as they are. Can't go wrong with book...even if you area beginner or a long time baker."
5,just as good as ever,"I knew this book many years ago. I bought it for a friend who is getting into baking (she's an amazing cook already) and I knew it was going to be a part of her permanent collection. she was really pleased with the book, got a new sense of the essence of bread, got to own a famous book on baking. It was a smash hit as a gift for someone earthly, natural who wants to learn not only baking but the spirit of baking as well."
4,"Cute, Useful for Awhile","I have the bedding set but I didn't register for this mobile because I was going to get a more educational one. However, when I received it as a gift, I thought I would give it a try because it matched the set. It is very pretty and works fine on my crib. The length of the music is a little short and I have to wind it up two or three times in a row, but I have a CD player in the room for when I want music that lasts awhile. The colors and movement of the animals entertain the baby for about three song lengths then he becomes uninterested. Once the baby starts moving around, I'll have to take it down anyway so I'll put in other crib toys. I would recommend it because like all mobiles it can only be used for a little while."
3,Hard to apply,"I baby-proofed every sharp edge in my living room with this tape, and it does the job. It's a bit difficult to apply, and the adhesive is not super-strong, which is good if you don't want to permanently baby-proof your furniture, but bad if your baby decides it's a fun toy, because they can pull it right off. Also hard to put around corners, but I got around it by cutting a slit where it went around the edge."
3,does not stick well,I put this tape around our platform bed and the next morning it was hanging down like a garland. Have to fix it every day now.
5,Recommended by a hair stylist,"This came to me recommended by my hair stylist. I have curly, frizzy hair that i regularly straighten. Along with the S Factor deep conditioner, my hair is silky and smooth."
3,ehhhh....,I ordered this product hoping that it would help my frizziness and whatnot because my John Frieda Frizzez was not working for me. It smells great and I got it for a great cheap price. I remembered this product from last year when my hair dresser used this on my hair. I remembered it worked great then. I've used for only a couple of days now and to be honest I haven't really seen much of a difference. I used it on dry hair the first day and then wet hair on the second day. Maybe my hair dresser had some kind of magic touch or maybe I'm not using this product correctly. It does work when I blow dry it into my hair but it doesn't last long at all. Within a few hours its like I didn't put anything on it at all. It does smell pretty good and its great that you only have to use just a little bit to go a long way but I just wished it worked better.
3,10 Year Old Boy,Battery worked great. Toy is a little to fast and aggressive for indoor play with my 10 year old boy.
3,"It was average, but not what I was looking for","This book is valuable if you know nothing about showmanship, but I was looking for a more instruction-centered book. I'm teaching my mare showmanship to show this summer and was looking for a step-by-step guide rather than a synopsis.I have trained two three-year-old paints in showmanship previously but their skills were never as refined as I would've liked. I'm looking for help in finishing skills and this book didn't give that to the degree I hoped for.It is well written and covers everything about showmanship. My only warnings to potential buyers is that the photos sometimes do not correspond to what is being discussed on the pages and the show clothing is dated. Keep up with current trends and use this book as a tool for beginners. Overall it wasn't a bad addition to my library, just would've liked a little more. : )"
5,Excellent Book,"I traveled to Laos in January, 2002 and found that the Rough Guide to Laos enhanced my experience tremendously. The writing is much more thorough and intelligent than Lonely Planet's guidebook for Laos. About 95% of independent travelers depend on the Lonely Planet book, but I think Rough Guide does a much better job. Laos is changing quickly so there are oftentimes many additional restaurants and hotels in a town that were not around when the book was researched, but that is not a major problem. I highly recommend this book."
3,How Many Of These Movies Can You Watch?,"I pose that question seriously. There are so many of these films available, and what's worse is that most fall into the catagory of ""Here's more of the same"" that they almost give revenge flix a bad name. There's a tsunami of them to drown in, and this series brings nothing new to the table, though I've only seen two of the three. Adequate, maybe, horrible, no, but run out to add to a collection? Hardly. Once watched, there's precious little left to offer in repeated viewings. Stick with the top shelf of these films from that era - 'Blind Woman's Curse', 'Lady Snowblood' 1 and 2, and 'Bohachi Bushido; Code Of The Forgotten Eight'. And more recently, the excellent 'Azumi' for true kickass enjoyment. I'd rather sit through Quick Draw McGraw before Quick Draw Okatsu..."
3,Smells great but not very effective,"I bought Mrs. Meyers shower cleaner under the impression that it is a regular cleaner. However, when I read the directions I realised that it really not for cleaning but maintaining a clean shower. If you clean you clean your shower with some other product and spray this on everyday it helps keep it cleaner. To me it is an unnecessary expense. I won't buy it again."
5,This game was so fun,"Well the game was amzing but it had one little flaw. I hate when you play by yourself and you return punts or kickoffs and it goes into close up camera mode. But other than that the game was really fun and the campus legend was awesome how you have to balance your time with social, study, and position work times. Overall the game was spectacular."
4,"Good Gameplay, Terrible Penalties!","NCAA 2007 is one of the better EA sports games. The controls are easy enought that my father, who can barely hold the controller right, can play. The only real problem with the game is all the stupid celebration penalties. It seems like every play one of your players celebrates and gets a penalty! Don't bother turning that penalty off because it doesn't matter. Celebration penalites will still be called against your A.I. players. I went an entire game where every score had a celebration penalty."
1,Terrible,This game is the worst of all the previous NCAA football games at least since 2002. The kicking game is horrendous. The Campus Legend mode is a joke and many things have been changed on offense and defense in a negative way. This game is atrocious.
3,gene wilder got robbed...,"if it wasn't for the godfather coming out the same year(1972) and three of its supporting actors being nominated for the oscar(caan, pacino, duvall), gene wilder would almost certainly have been nominated for best supporting actor for his performance in ""what is sodomy?"" and may have even won... joel grey was nominated and won for cabaret that year, but eddie albert in heartbreak kid..? over wilder..? come on... wilder's 23-second take when stavros milos tells him he's ""in love with a sheep"" is one of the funniest things i've ever seen in my life... and when he's yelling at the customers in the deli... ""i'm not a waiter..! don't call me 'waiter'..! i'm a doctor..!"" oh, my god... wilder got robbed, plain and simple... an overlooked and underacknowledged masterpiece... on par with his work in wonka and young frankenstein..."
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH AMERICAN DVD PLAYERS,The dvd is not compatible with american format players. No where on the ad was this stated. Now we are trying to find one to play it. I will not order another older dvd from Amazon. You shouldn't be allowed to sell non-compatible items without bolding stating so!
1,Garbage.,"Huge disappointment from an otherwise consistent, high-quality period in Allen's career. I'm no prude, but the whole exercise is simply base and comes across as simply dirty as opposed to dirty and clever - even the Austin Powers films display greater sexual wit. The ""Fantastic Voyage"" sendup is definitely the highlight, but nary a laugh is to be found in the remainder of the film. And references to gang-rape and child molestation simply are not funny in any context."
4,Pretty Patchwork & Stitching Details,"This lampshade is very pretty and matches the set very well. I especially like the patchwork and stitching details. I didn't care for the base, so I like that I could purchase the shade separately and put it on a plain white base. The shade is made with two metal prongs that slide onto a light bulb. This is a plus because it can fit on just about any lampshade. However, it's a minus because it doesn't stay in place very well if you hit it while turning the lamp on. I would still recommend it because it is very pretty and the size is just right."
3,Multiple Streams of Internet Income is Outdated,"The book was very informative, but very much outdated. It is not what I was really hoping for.Lanesa Stubbs"
3,It's time for a revision,"A lot of the techniques discussed in this book rely on using e-mail marketing. With the spam problem getting worse, many of the ideas won't work or will require too much effort to get your marketing messages delivered.The book does provide solid explanations on other ways to make money online, but there're newer strategies being used.I can't recommend another book at this time. Your best bet is to do searches on the Internet for money making ideas.This would have been a 5 star book when it first came out. If Allen were to write a revised edition I would get it."
2,Not so much,"Want to know his secret for making $24,000 in 24 hours? First you need to create a website and get thousands of people to sign up for your free newsletter. (He sort of glosses over exactly how he did that). Then wait a year or two to get your subscribers to trust you. Then send out an email selling something to your subscribers and sit back while watching the money flow in. It's as ""easy"" as that!I thought his ""Multiple Streams of Income"" was a pretty good book. Good enough that I actually used some of his ideas in that book a few years back and still have some income streams from them. But this book was practically worthless. The ideas are outdated, the marketing strategies were obvious, and there was no real value from reading it.If you really want to see what this book is about, check it out from the library and save your money on something else."
1,Not exactly.,I?m always looking for new ideas - but this highly touted book was in reality a very disapointing read. Nothing new here. Very basic stuff - not for anyone who is already on the internet because frankly almost all of the info in this book is already available from many sources - for free. This book is by the same guy who made so much money selling books about how to buy R.E. for no money down - then left to go into network marketing of all things. Ancient Chinese Proverb says: Caveat Emptor!
3,Nice bag but . . .,"This is a nice bag. Has lots of compartments and would hold all my accessories. Unfortunatly, it was too small for my gigantic 17"" laptop. If only the product info listed the dimensions of the laptop sleave, I would not have to go to all the trouble of getting another bag. If only this bag would have held my laptop, it would have been nice, and trendy too."
5,"Some Good Stories, Some Superb Stories","Peter Beagle has given us six stories set in the world of his novel The Innkeeper's Song. It's the same world, but not the same location, and, except for one story, not the same characters. Other reviewers have pointed out that the fact that there is a different teller for each story helps maintain interest from story to story, and I agree. I also agree (mostly) with the reviewer who states that the last three stories in the book are better than the first three. I found ""Choushi-Wai's Story"" to be as good a story as I've ever read, comparable in quality to P.G. Wodehouse's ""Lord Emsworth and the Girl-Friend"", Yasunari Kawabata's ""The Dancing Girl of Izu"", or the best of Hemingway's stories. ""Giant Bones"", the title story, isn't far behind.Beagle is that rare author who has given us both great novels and great stories, and readers have been blessed that he has done that for close to fifty years now."
4,Lacking in Sound Quality!!!!,"How come the First Season pack has Dolby Digital 5.1, Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround and Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono while THIS pack only has Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround???????????????Warner Home Video is truly taking a crap on their fans and costumers!!!!!I fear what the the third season pack will lack..."
3,better than Season one,"I started watching & put it aside for awhile. Season one interested me enough to buy season 2, but I am slow to get through it."
5,Gotta Have It!!!,"Hello, HBO... Are you listening? Demand is huge already for Season 2 on DVD... Let's have it, already!"
4,"Lots of personality quirks and drama, very compelling","I liked it so much and every seaon afterwards! Unique situational drama, from tragedy, to comedy, to irony and more."
5,fabulous show - please release this dvd,"Please, please, please release this dvd soon! This is one of the best shows on tv, yet the second season is still not out."
1,A downer for an otherwise good band,"If you like the Wilco of the past, I am afraid you will be as disappointed as I was by this horrid album. It marks a major departure from Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, if not in style, at least in the quality of the music. It also is a long cry from the gutsy roots rock that was part of the collabrative work done with Billy Bragg. I am really glad I listened to this one first and didn't drop the $15 on it."
4,Solid,"It wouldn't be fair to compare A Ghost is Born to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. After all, what music lover wants recycled songs and ideas? That being said, I think Wilco pulled off a great follow-up to an even greater album with their latest release. My first impression was that Ghost seemed a bit disjointed in its song selections, but after further listens, it seems to work (excluding the end of ""Less Than You Think""). I like the mix of bluesy piano and acoustic guitar throughout, and without the feedback and experimental noises found in YHF. Great tracks such as ""Hell Is Chrome"", ""Handshake Drugs"", ""Company In My Back"", and ""I'm A Wheel"" are textbook Wilco, but it's the tracks such as ""Spiders"", ""Muzzle Of Bees"", ""Theologians"", and the very Beatle-esque ""Hummingbird"" that are a bit of a departure and really seem to make Ghost work. Bottom line: it's the perfect evolution for a band that is currently one of America's best."
5,"""View From the Top""","This was such a great movie. Don't listen to the critics. Its harmless, fun, free, funny, and overall great! I saw it with my girlfriend and we both loved it. Mike Myers is as funny as when he is in Austin Powers! See this movie its light and fun. Candice Bergen was so funny and it was a great escape! See it. Im going to buy the DVD!"
2,View of the Slop,"Gwyneth Paltrow stars as Donna, a small-town girl who dreams of escaping the banality of rural living. Dumped by her boyfriend, Donna hooks up with a new bland guy and learns how be a stewardess.I found ""View"" to be a real let down. Gwyneth, was cute, Mike Myers was oddly endearing, but I HATED the premise, and the romance was just BOR-ring. I also hate, hate, hate stories where the heroine 'gives up her career' for a man. The authors tried to pull the impact of the 'self-sacrificing heroine stereotype,' by giving us a 'surprise' at the ending, but I'm not buying it. It came off WAY too contrived. Also, what with making her boyfriend a lawyer? Is it too much to let him remain a lifeguard, and let Paltrow make the bucks? This is the 21rst century after all.A disappointing movie which delivers drivel, instead of laughs, filled with annoying stereotypes and and questionable message. Ech..."
3,"Some good, some bad","This movie had true potential of being good. It explores true determination and love, a rarity. However, the writers missed a lot of important details. They could have explored love further. Gwyneth Paltrow is a terrific actress, but the lacking of demand doesn't match her. Her acting is the best movie feature. Everyone else was either underreacted (Mark Ruffalo) or overreacted (Mike Myers).Despite the downfall, ""View From the Top"" has a lot of funny scenes, which make up for the defects. The flight attendant outfits are creative and match the movie's theme well. It teaches the audience many valuable life lessons, those that one would least expect.""View From the Top"" may have mixed reactions; some may like it, some may not. It depends on the audience. Either way, everyone will be entertained."
4,Gwyney divy,"I like Gwyneth and Christina, and this is a fun chick flick with a message, and a minimal sexy (swimsuit). A fun movie about the airline industry and what we used to call stews. From a stew I dated years ago, it's fairly accurate about their lives, even with the hollywood ending."
2,Great if you only like chicks in short shirts and bikinis,This movie makes no sense at all--a weak plot-it is plain stupid-great if you like looking at some real foxy actresses in minis or bikinis-I could look at this with the sound off and it would not matter--the humor is weak and Patrow is foxy as ever but acting is terrible-there are alot of foxy girls in this movie but thats about it--extras are stupid--I say--rent it and forget it.
5,Wilderness and Grizzlies: This has it all!,"This book is one of the best books I've ever read. David Petersen does a fantastic job of educating the reader while involving them in some exciting adventures. While searching for grizzlies in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado, David fills you in on grizzly natural history, the history of the San Juans, and the need for preserving wilderness in North America. This is a must have book for all who are interested in grizzly bears, the Rockies, wilderness, and the outdoors in general."
5,Msterful Inquiry Into Nazi Horror,"This descriptive and introspective account of the Eichman trial, Nazi history, and what it means is the best book in the area that I have encounted. If it far better than Arendt. Anyone interested in the trial, in evil, in the Nazis, what it all means should read and reflect on what he has seen to write his reflections and analysis. Not rigorous, not designed to prove or persuade, he suggests by example and by inference a powerful way to comprehend the trial, man, the Nazis, the past which allowed it and the future which could produce it again."
1,1 star out of 4,"The Bottom Line:An awful movie whose terrible production values preclude a ""so bad it's good"" effect, Beware! The Blob! has nothing going for it whatsoever and should be avoided by any and all potential watchers."
2,Good for FPGEE but not for NAPLEX,this book is very hepful for taking FPGEE but it have very less role in Naplex.I will tell you all with the my experiance i have studied APHA pharamcy review for naplex whic is the best book.If any body taking naplex please also do Kaptest online which also have lot of patient profiles which actually come for your naplex.KAPLAN review is just helpful after you have studied some theory from some books like APHA.
3,Comp Pharm REview good but was not helpful to me...,"Honestly i was expecting an audio device and not pictures.I discovered that i don't have enough time to sit down and read, so was looking for an audio device that can kick start me into reading"
2,Why would you waste your time listening to this?,"Looking at the reviews other amazon customers wrote about this album astounds me. So much so that I can grasp why wars break out and people generally disagree; how can some find this pleasureable and others completely deplorable? I don't get it. At the time I bought this I was really into finding ""new"" artists and giving them a chance. ""Chameleon in the shadow"" and ""Silent Corner"" were very different from what I had been listening to, and after a couple weeks I found them to be rather engaging. I've had ""Future Now"" for over a year and I still can't get into it, after listening to it today for probably the fifth time I don't think I'll wasted any more of my time with it."
1,Disappointment if you're looking for the classics,"If you're looking for original classics such as Gazebo's 80's hit ""Masterpiece"", then skip right over this CD since both versions on the disc of this song are bad remixes produced especially for this compilation sometime in the mid-nineties which are way over-produced. Let's face it, classics from the 80's were meant to stay in that decade. Other better Gazebo compilations exist, notably ""The Collection""."
2,"Good at Poaching, bad at flavor","Item was purchased for me as a Christmas gift from another site. It's a very nice poacher, but I'll swear to my grave the flavor and aroma of the eggs is affected by the non-stick coating. Was hoping maybe through multiple uses; heating, cooling, and hand cleaning would ""break in"" the cups, but the awful metallic/chemical flavor is still there. Can't believe I'm the first one to say something about it."
3,good quality but hot handle,This pan is durable and the nonstick egg cups are easy to clean. We've used it for months now and my only complaint is the metal handle gets as hot as the pan and you need a potholder to pick it up.
4,"Classic Eighties Groove, two standout tracks","Let me start with the tracklisting:1. Do it to the music - Raw Silk2. So fine - Johnson, Howard3. After the dance is through - Krystol4. I'll be a freak for you - Royalle Delite5. Main thing - Shot6. You used to hold me so tight - Houston, Thelma7. Fool's paradise - Morgan, Meli'sa8. Who do you love - Wright, Bernard9. Hanging on a string - Loose Ends10. Change of heart - Change11. Settle down - Thomas, Lillo12. Encore - Lynn, CherylNot the best in an otherwise hi-quality Mastercuts series. But, Raw Silk's 'Do It to The Music' and Main Thing by Shot are worth the price of the CD alone, unless you find the vinyl versions."
4,Great collection and editon,"Great collection AND edition! A lot of Americans read the short stories Billy Bud, Bartleby,or Benito Cereno at some point in their college life, and rightly so. Growing up in Belgium I have to admit I associated Melville only with whales ..."
4,The Economist pronounced ...,"In its 16 December 2000 edition [p109], ""The Economist"" reviewed this book favourably. Haven't read it, but - based on the review - am ordering it now. (A bit puzzling that the publishers have not bothered to stir, failing to put a blurb here. Slack!)"
3,It's All In The Name!,"My granddaughter loves anything, as long as it's Bratz. I bought this for her this Christmas. She was thrilled with it and sat and played it for hours. I found it had some good points and some bad. First the bad. It isn't made well, the legs kept falling off while she was playing the game and that was quite frustrating and it was smaller than it looked, and not very durable. However, it was very colorful and the little Bratz figures that you place on the side are a nice touch.My granddaughter didn't seem to mind the little things that I saw wrong with it, so I suppose that is what matters in the end."
4,Cute and Colorful,"I got this valence with the bedding set. I have a single window in the room and the width is adequate. I have it hanging on a wide white wooden rod and it hangs pretty well but looks a little droopy because the tabs are so large. It is very pretty though and the colors brighten up a plain window with white blinds. I would recommend it because had it not come with the set, I would have purchased it anyway to add more color to the room."
4,Malawi Valance,"My husband and I love this set of bedding, etc. for the nursery. We painted the walls green and purple (green on top, border then purple) and it looks adorable:) The valances are great and really finish the look off. The only thing is that I had to stitch the loops up about 2 inches or so. Otherwise, the valances hung low and you could see the blinds on the top. Once I shortened the valance though, it looks great."
3,Better for wall decor than window valance.,"We got this valance as part of the bedding set and I'm glad we didn't pay for it separately. The tabs are very long and it simply doesn't hang right (you can see the top of our blinds?!). But, we cut off the tabs, hung it above the changing table, and now it looks adorable! Our son loves to talk to the animals while being changed and/or dressed."
5,This is the Ish,"These 3 emcees all work together to form a very good album. Eligh produces some dope ass beats and also shows us sometimes that he does have some lyricals for us to hear. Murs is a god to underground music and you can tell why on this CD. The third member of 3MG is Scarub who is often overlooked. Scarub perfoms well on this CD and is making a name for himself. Overall this CD is very good. If you can find it, cop it.Top Trax: Halo, the Plannit, 3 men marchingMost overlooked track: And If"
1,I got fooled!,"The Bear's guide used to be an excellent resource. Now, it's been watered down into a series of books rather than all the needed info in one book, I presume to make obscene amounts of money. So, save yours! There's better info online, and it's free!"
5,WOW!,"The Piano Quintet, Op. 29 is simple astounding. Black tears; this Quintet is the ""tear-stained flower of the poet's mind."" Here, one is not asked to listen to melody, but rather a cascade of threads of melody woven together in the subconscience. This is impressionism in its most quintessential form. I highly recommend this recording for its addition of this marvelous Piano Quintet - a gem of the modern world."
4,Chambray Hamper,I bought this four our 4 year old's room. It's done in horses and the blue matched perfectly with her bed spread. The mesh bag inside could be a little bigger. But it seems to work fine.
1,disappointed,"the fabric is very coarse. i was expecting so much more for the money. after one wash, they look like they are years old."
1,Not again!,"I happened to buy all three of the Okatsy movies, partially based on positive reviews, and the third one definitely was unnecessary to make or watch. Okatsu gets raped (again), and manages to lose another set of parents (again), which, in Oscar Wilde's words, smacks of carelessness, and we get to see more of Junko Miyazono's poorly choreographed sword play.The costumes are surprisingly good, the make-up has the usual shortcomings for Japanese movies of the period. If it is porn you are after, there is nothing to see. If you want to see good swordplay, get a movie with Toshiro Mifune, but this is just Japanese trash, just like the rest of the pinky violence series."
2,House of Rothchild Vol 1,How totally ignorant is it that Volume 2 can be purchased for the Kindle when Volume 1 can't be purchased for the Kindle ? This is the kind of stuff that keeps people upset and confused !
4,Great book,"A great little guide for a family getaway including important information like: addresses, phone numbers, cost and descriptions. The only drawback I saw was a misspelling of ""Hiram Chittenden Locks,"" there is no ""o"" in Chittenden. Since he was an ancestor of mine I noticed that you didn't spell it correctly. Maybe that could be fixed with a re-edited version."
5,Get to know what Life is all about . . . before it's out!,"Akin to Hugh Prather's NOTES TO MYSELF, Kay Anderson's I AND THOU in the HERE AND NOW offers positive capsules of optimism from an awakened and enlightened consciousness. If you feel alone and confused about the way human friction and fears torment us through life, this is the book to read. Ms Anderson writes: Life can be beautiful if we care enough about ourselves and others. Either we go forward, or we go backward."" It's a gret UPPER!"
4,"Nicely done, something for everyone...","This was my first exposure to Schooner Fare, who apparently have been performing in, and around Maine, for decades. The song choices are a great mixture of the familiar and the exotic, and the singing and picking are high quality. This one can be enjoyed in any month of the year, although I can imagine it being a staple in December in any household that owns it."
2,A little disappointed,"I bought this for my Kimber 1911, and while it is well made, I am not sure about the design. The cross piece in the back that fits in the middle of back in the pictures has a tendency to work it's way up my back to the point where it almost comes up above my collar. I bought the separate belt loop to anchor the magazine side to my belt, and it still does it. I have played with the balancing of the holster itself, tilting it at various angles, and nothing seems to work. I think this is a design flaw that can not be fixed. While the holster is wearable, and reasonably comfortable when it is placed properly on the back, I am constantly have to adjust it, pulling the back down and re-positioning it. I have stopped wearing it, and have gone to a Milt Sparks IWB holster, which is more satisfactory than this."
1,Awful!!!,"This has to have been the worst film I have ever seen, next to Monster A Go-Go and A Kid in King Arthur's Court!! This review will not do it justice."
1,Pound on this DVD,This movie is a awful mess. The cast is forgettable. It has zero redeeming value. It has nothing to do with the TV series AND the toyline it was base on. The story makes zero sense at all. The animation is choppy & subpar. I seen better animation from TV Funhouse. The songs are awful and make the songs from The Tom & Jerry Movie sound good. The voice acting stinks. It sounds like it was done by a drunk 4 year old. I give this film 1 out of 10.
5,Great,Oh the memories! I bought this for my grandson to watch because I remembered it from when my kids were small. He loves it just as much as they did. It gets watched multiple times a week.
2,Poor Sound and Not Enogh Wes,"With so much Wes Montgomery out there, I would avoid this CD. The sound quality is poor, and on the Billy Taylor cuts the piano overly dominates. The live set with Clark Terry is much better, but the fifth track in the session is not included."
4,Great for beginners,"This was the first Feng Shui book I read (I have read now over 20)and I still find it one of the easiest to understand.Skinner touches on all aspects without going into great detail which may have made it boring for a beginner. Nice pictures too.If you are looking for uncomplicated initial knowledge of Feng Shui, I would recommend this book."
3,FUN IN THE BEGINNING BUT GET'S BORING QUICKLY,"My grandson loved this toy and was quite good at it, but it bacame very boring after only a short while. However, it is well constructed and worked very well. The laser works correctly and makes the hits as it should."
5,Turtles Are Back!!!,"When I heard the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were coming back after I had seen a commercial, I immediately got online to see if it was true( and to make sure it wasn't some kind of ""Robo Turtles""). I checked it out and found that it was actually surprisingly like the old Turtles. I was a fan of the Turtles since the early '90s , back when they were first popular. I had all the toys and I watched all the cartoons and movies. It is amazing they are making a comeback, but as long as they are, I'll get back into it. I recently purchased two of these toys and they're just like the old ones, aweosme."
3,Disappointed. Overpriced Ninja Turtle Toy. Too small.,"When my sister was young she loved the ninja turtles (Michelangelo was her favorite). She had a toy that was the size of a doll. I saw this online and thought it was perfect! It looked almost exactly like the one she had. (My nephew wants hers, but we have misplaced it.) Nowhere on here does it say the size of the toy. The picture makes it look a lot larger than it really is. It is so tiny and not worth the money I payed. I should have double checked on the size before my purchase, but the picture was misleading. (at least to me). A picture of it in the box would have shown its true size. I am extremely disappointed because I just spent close to $40 dollars on a toy that is about 5 inches... The Ninja Turtles are a classic, so a high price is okay. But not $40...*** This was a misunderstanding on my part. However, the seller should specify the size of this pocket-sized toy."
3,book,This is...kinky and stalkerish. The chick is a weirdo. For her to go to such lengths for just one dude is borderline crazy.
5,Paradise,"A masterpiece. If you like Mike Oldfield ( Tubular Bells or Music of the Spheres ) you should love this, keyboards orchestration strings flutes trumpets ect occasional percussion beautiful structures"
2,"Kind of a gullible writer, but an interesting read.","Texas Poker WisdomI wonder if he would like to shoot dice over the phone??Still, I enjoy the stories of the fabulous West Texas musicians. It is worth reading. More interviews, stories of West Texas musicians are on www.virtualubbock.com I just put an article up there entitled Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, Joe Ely, and the Cotton Club. It adds a different flavor.Johnny Hughes"
4,Great tool to have,"This tool is great to use weekly to help with shedding. My cat doesn't particularly like it, but it works great!"
2,Furminator ok,"I've seen the videos and there are people who swear by it. I thought the price was rather high for something that could be done almost as well as by a flea comb. I found this cat Furminator for a significantly reduced price and purchased it. I'm not super impressed by it, and my vet told me about a client who had nearly Furminated her cat bald, so maybe I am a bit too hesitant with it on my own cats. I think I like my flea comb just as well."
4,"Works well, but...","It does remove a lot of hair, but I do have to pull it off the comb every time I run it through my cats hair making it a very tedious motion."
4,Good tool for occasional grooming,"I have a Persian cat and, obviously, hair may be a problem at times. I used the FURminator with good results; I elimintated an impressive quantity of ""dead hairs"" and afterwards, hair seemed to fall less for the next few weeks. The cat wasn't crazy about it, but it tolerated it quite well.I do not think one should use the FURminator very often (not daily, in any case!), so it won't replace the cat's regular brush, but it is an excellent aid to the overall grooming."
5,IT WORKS!!!!,"What a great item. Here is something that says it works miracles and then ACTUALLY WORKS MIRACLES. Ok, perhaps that's a tad strong. The truth is, the Furminator works wonderfully. I've owned cats for 20+ years and had many many cat brushes and NONE of them can even come close to the Furminator for effectiveness. Get one of these, throw out the cheapies and you'll never have cat hair again!"
1,not great for my longhair,"It didn't help with his knots, and actually seemed to create more knots as his underfur got loosened but not removed. He seemed to hate getting brushed, which is not usually the case."
4,It works well,"I think this tool works well for removing that undercoat that cats constantly shed. My cat, however, is not so sure it is a good idea. She prefers just a fine-toothed comb."
5,Amazing!,"To anyone in doubt:This works! I have an all white medium-haired cat and his shedding was out of control! Although he is a handsome cat, his fur everywhere made my house look unclean and my clothes look bad. Brushing with a regular cat brush did nothing. My cat sheds a lot less now, I would say 90% less! Before, huge amounts of fur would float from him when he moved or when I would pet him! Now, I can COUNT the strands he sheds! I brush him for 15 minutes everyday and always get a ball of fur the size of a hamster! He does seem to enjoy it even though he is very hyper an d does not like to sit still. Its a great product to cut down on cleaning and add to bonding with your furry kid!"
5,The FURminator lives up to its claim and more!,"I was hesitant to spend almost $20 on a brush for my short-haired-but-ever-so-shedding kitty. I've tried all sorts of different types of cat brushes, but none have even come close to how well the Furminator works! My kitty has gone from a shedding machine, even with hours of weekly brushing, to a well groomed beast. It's a little harsher on his skin then other brushes, but he doesn't seem to mind. It is definitely worth the investment!"
2,AWESOME,"I HAVE A VERY LARGE CAT-SOME PEOPLE THINK HE' A RACOON.MY CO-WORKER TOLD ME ABOUT THE FURMINATOR.AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A MOVIE BUT WENT TO AMAZON AND BOUGHT THE ""BRUSH"" WELL NOT ONLY DID IT GET ALL THE EXCESS ""FUR"" BUT HE LOOKS 20LBS LIGHTER.AND HE JUST LOVES TO GET ""FURMINATED""RICK"
2,deshedding tool,"It was way too small.But the other size available, I thought would be too large. I should've returned it, but I've lost alll of the paperwork that came with it."
4,fur-o-rama,"This tool is helpful, if pricey. (I was so desperate to do SOMETHING about my Maine Coon-Pixie Bob longhair and her epic shedding that I would have tried ANYTHING.)The Furminator gets rid of a lot of her dead undercoat (she seems to have a triple coat--whee!). She had been trying to get rid of the stuff herself by pulling on her fur with her teeth--hairballs abounding.She seems to like the feeling of being brushed with this tool almost as much as she does her softer brush--though she won't let me brush her stomach area with either one. I started very gently with the Furminator, since it doesn't feel like a regular brush. I've also made the grooming a ""condition"" of her favorite game--leaping in the air to catch treats. Three or four treats--a brushing--then more treats."
5,works great,This brush works great. It seems to get at the undercoat. It's amazing my cats have any hair left after they are brushed.
4,Be aware of remaining fur after using it,"I love the furminator because it really worked for my furry friends. Two siberian cats. One does not mind me brushing him with the furminator but the other one does not like it. I think it's because he can feel the edge of the furminator brush, which is kinda sharp. He has slightly shorter hair. Anyway, this help tremendously with eliminating loose hair. But, be aware of one thing. After brushing them, I find the ""furminated"" fur still remain hanging loose and they shed those remains all day long. For me, best thing to do is to ""furminate"" them AND also brush with the regular(bristle one)brush to remove the remaining fur afterwards. It does take some time. But as long as the kitties allow me to do, i don't mind. Good luck!"
4,Effective,"This thing really does take a lot of fur off of my cat. She loves it and will sit for me as long as it takes for me to finish. I tried using it on my small dog as well and he has such sensitive skin he cries when I use it on him. So if your animal has sensitive skin I wouldn't recommend buying this. But otherwise, it isn't a bad tool."
5,Love it!,"This is my second one. I don't know what happened to the first one but we can't go without.It pulls hair from the undercoat where normal brushes don't. My cats love it, so do I. No more tumble weed furballs rolling across my floor."
4,Great Product,I really like this product! It gets a lot of hair off of our cats. I just wish my kitties would cooperate and sit still for me!
5,Great Cat Brush!,"This tool is awesome. It removes tons of hair from my cat, and she even enjoys getting brushed! She sits in my lap and I pet her face with one hand and brush her with the other hand. It makes her coat very shiny, diminishes her dandruff, and greatly reduces shedding. I highly recommend this product."
5,Gotta Have It,"We have 6 cats (2 are short hairs). I have that rake/comb that you see at County Fairs, and it works great...for only 1 cat. Is useless for the others, but I thought it was a good investment, until now.The Furminator was a spectacular buy and a big hit. The cats actually like to be combed with it, even the one who's notoriously skittish about everything else but won't groom himself, and so gets mats routinely. I've got a wastebasket full of fur from just 4 of them so far, and it immediately stopped those clumps of white hair (from one of our Ragdolls) showing up on the carpet all over the house.Should be a required tool in any household with cats."
5,Furminator!,"This worked very well, although the packaging of the product does not prepare you for how much hair will fly all over, but that's not the seller's fault. They were absolutely great, and it cost me a third of the price the same item was being offered for at local pet stores."
4,Does it's job!,Great product...and definitely is easy to use.Came quickly even during the Xmas rush.
4,Great for removing hair,This product really works for removing hair--but my cats still hate it and run every time I get it out.
4,Works as promised,"My sister bought a Furminator for her cat and loved it. I held off on buying one due to the high price tag. I finally found one on Amazon that was below $20 for my cat, and took the plunge. So far so good. My cat tolerates it and the Furminator does a great job at pulling/combing out the loose cat hair. It also seems to be constructed very well. I still think the Furminator is overpriced, but I'm happy that I finally got it."
4,Let the Fur Fly!,"I have 4 cats so shedding is a constant issue at my house. The first time I used this I started to become concerned at the amount of hair after a while. Was I going to have a bald cat?? No, she just had that much loose and dead hair!It is a little tricky if you cat does not like to be brushed or combed at all. I have to work a little slower with this than a rubber brush, so they get impatient. And I have one that just can't seem to get used to it. I think her skin is just to sensitive. For her, I will stick to using a shedding blade which is the only thing I have found that even comes close to doing the job that this thing doea.And if you can brush your cat outside...you might want to consider it. You will be coated in fur and have a huge pile to deal with once you are done."
5,Great tool!,"Shipped fast, new condition as promised. I have two cats and the furminator works great on both. I have to do it frequently though as they are fur generators. Great product & service."
4,I like this but,My one cat has very long fine fluffy hair & this really doesn't work as well as it does on the Siamese. I love it for her though. Takes off the excess that she's too fat to catch on her rear! :-)
2,They sent a knock off brand.....,They send a knock off brand one to me. Some no name de-shedding tool. It looks similar and has the same 1.75'' edge. But really? You cant send what you advertise? It still works and I'm not gonna bother sending it back and waste more money on shipping.
3,Be careful!!,"I bought this for my medium sized tuxedo and long-haired female cats. I just finished brushing my cat today when I noticed the fur on her back was so thin after brushing her with this that you could see her skin. I had brushed her for only about six minutes. Bottom line, it works but be careful not to over-do it!!!"
2,Not really all I expected,"After reading all the other reviews I couldn't wait to get my hands on this... but it wasn't 'all that' for me and my long haired cats. The Furminator took off less fur than the wire brush I had already been using! Maybe it has to do with they type of hair/fur, who knows? Obviously it works great for some people, but it wasn't worth $20 to me. I'll be passing it on to a friend in hopes they have better luck with it."
3,It actually cuts the fur,"This brush takes off a TON of fur, but after the first time using it I wondered whether it does so not because it's getting to the ""undercoat,"" but rather, that it's just cutting away at the outside layer -- similar to how some salons will thin human hair by running a razor blade down it.I tested this theory with an experiment. I took a length of ordinary thread and ran it past the teeth of the Furminator. The thread immediately snapped, cut in two by the razor-edge.Despite this blunt proof of somewhat misleading advertising, the Furminator *is* a satisfying tool... if you don't mind being satisfied by having a leaner cat after a couple of strokes! On one hand, it does get rid of excess fur simply because it's like giving the kitty a quick (and admittedly even) haircut; but on the other, maybe a haircut isn't what we're thinking of when we want to minimize normal shedding?"
5,Milo and I are so happy,"Milo is 20 years old, and I've brushed him - with what I thought was a really effective cat-brush - all along the way. Based on other reviews, I got this and within 5 min we'd removed so much more hair, really! Huge fur-balls from a supposedly groomed cat. And he loved it. It must be a professional grade tool."
5,Excellent tool,"We have four cats, one of whom is 26 pounds. He is the one who doesn't like to be brushed. Needless to say, he's pretty much in charge of his own universe. We have tried many different brushing tools on him. He allows a couple of brushes and then it's over.But with this tool, he literally stopped eating and stopped and waited while we brushed him. He enjoyed it. It felt good. It also pulled out knots and undercoat.This tool is superb."
5,No More Cat Hair everywhere!,"My cats, who hate to be brushed, actually sit still for this. It does a great job of removing loose hair. Unfortunately, I didn't realize it would remove ""all"" hair if you keep brushing in one area! Poor kitty, she now has very little hair down her back! But if done correctly, it works beautifully."
5,Have to try to believe it!,"So I was very skeptical...I have a Himalayan so cat hair is something I am used to. I have bought so many ""gadgets"" and I've always been disappointed. I had heard about this product but found it at the local pet store for $35 and was not ready to pay that much money for something I was not sure would work. I then found the same item here for a fraction of the price. All the reviews were good so I decided to purchase it. I am SO GLAD I did. This tool is amazing! I used it for a few minutes on my cat last night and I got so much hair out. My cat is happy so it doesn't seem to create any pain or discomfort and I have never used something so efficient. It is supposed to reduce up to 90% of shedding, well now that I have tried it, I am not surprised! I have one regret...I should have bought it much earlier!"
2,"No Blu Ray, No Widescreen. Pointless to order.","Very Very disappointed to see it is not Widescreen, and there was no indication in the original advertising. I might have even missed it before opening the packaging if I had not gotten bored and read previous reviews. Since Blu Ray isnt an option yet, I finally broke down and decided widescreen is at least better than nothing. Now I find I received nothing. Sent back same day."
5,The road warrior,sequal to madmax loved it ever since i saw it for the first time. I watch it every other week or so cause its so exciting but still believable ITS A EXCELLENT MOVIE
2,anoid,These movies contain subtitles whether you want them or not I found this terrably distracting considering these movies are in english already. I cannot recomend this double feature. If other versions don't have the subtitles I'd go with that.
5,Windows will never be like this again...,The packaging heralded the age of cloud computing....all the way back in 1995. Still a viable upgrade from Windows Vista. Get it now before it becomes out of date!
5,Wonderful but if you have dogs and cats...,"This book is a vital addition to my herbal library. The information is clearly organized and easily understood for beginners. However, if you have both dogs and cats and are thinking about buying both Dr. Kidd's Guide to Herbal Dog Care and Herbal Cat Care books, there really isn't much difference between the two books."
2,The Jab vs. The Straight Lead of JKD,"I break down the book's weaknesses here. Here's an excerpt, and the rest of the article is in the link:Having just read The Straight Lead by Teri Tom, I was compelled to write about ""The Boxing Jab."" The straight lead works as a more powerful jab than the boxing jab, and it indeed has more reach than the classic boxing jab. The problem is that the straight lead serves no additional function from a `regular jab' than to make up for its lack of power in the wrist (as the straight lead's form is to not turn the wrist) with explosive hip rotation. JKD people tend to overstate the effectiveness of hip rotation in the jab, simultaneously underestimating the effectiveness of shifting weight and the dynamics of not rotating the hip with the jab.[...]"
4,Great Atlas but No Cities,"This is a great road atlas of Oregon with terrific detail and well-laid-out coverage. I especially appreciate the landscape maps design and the separate sections on major recreation areas. The mileage charts between all cities is especially useful for trip planning. However, out of all the other state Benchmark Atlases I have seen or have, Oregon is the only one to leave out full page maps of major cities and streets. I would have liked to see details of at least Eugene, Corvallis, Salem and even Portland. But nothing in this particular book. This disappointment kept the rating at just 4 stars."
1,Terrible!,"I never write reviews, but I had to in this case. Total Junk! Low receiver rating and a poor excuse for private enterprise... Onkyo sickened me with this product so much that I will never buy from them again..."
2,Disappointed,"I can't believe all those wonderful ratings for this book. All I see is a man who vowed never to marry again, but was willing to ruin a virgin maiden for his own self gratification, and not caring what this would mean to a young girl in this time setting. No hero there for me to see. As for the heroine she is a hot sex fiend and I fail to see how Love enteres this arena. It take a preist who should be commited himself to ""open"" his eyes and at the peril to her life to make him relaize he Loves her. Where are the scruples of these girls ? And in a time period where this is taboo. I'd love to read a REAL LOVE story where it didn't take the capitulation of the heroine into the sex act to make the Hero fall in ""love"" with her. How about caring, and protecting her from the scorn of people and showing his true value of her.Hot torrid sex is not necessarly an act of love. Please someone out there write a Love story. This is after all supposed to be fantasy. Not REAL life."

2,You hear your voice over the synthesized voice,The kids thought it was fun but you hear your own voice over the projected ones. The different voices sound very familiar.
3,Voice Changer,"It was ok, but the voice is distorted too much..can't really understand most things being said. Changing from the 4 options did not help."
2,Not what I expected....,"Nine years ago when I had my second child I had the type that went over and under my belly...which was great but of course I've since given it away. With this child, I decided to buy this adjustable prenatal cradle and it was okay...yes, it supported the weight of my belly but didn't give me enough back support that I required and to add to that it wasn't really user-friendly (so to speak), meaning it only had 3 choices to choose from to adjust for size...once you've outgrown the last eye & hook because you estimate the size you'll get but don't expect to exceed that size, it's useless....the previous one I had (9 yrs ago) was velcro style which held up wonderfully and I wish I would've stuck with that same style which would've saved me some money."
5,Reservoir Dogs (15th Anniversary 2-Disc Special Edition),"A very good edition of this great film, in a beautiful metallic box simulating a really incredible gasoline boat and the package where the disc are simulating a matchbox, a very good version with many extras and good sound in the film."
4,The best movie of all time,Reservior Dogs was one of my all time favorite movies. Harvey Kietel is excellent. I think you willl find most interest and quality in michale Madsens Mr. Blonde. It is a twisted film as well.
4,I watched it for the 1st time when I was 11.,"Reservoir Dogs was for the 1st installment of Quentin's movies. I have to say this man is a genius. I remember when I 1st saw it, it had me fizzled a little. Then I couldn't get it out of my mind because the scene with the cop was the best. The whole idea of the robbery and the using of colors as names was pure genius. There is no way I want to steal with people I know. At least you can say that you didn't know the man if you had to kill him. Now to this day sometimes when you get a traffic ticket or some cop stops you for something stupid. You take my advice rememeber what happened in this movie and I promise you, you'll feel better."
3,"Good movie,bad edition","When I was ordering this it said GAS CAN VERSION SPECIAL EDITION and I got an ordinary DVD with nothing inside a box or outside...Bad edition,but good movie though!"
5,kiks butt,"awesome!!!!! quentino is an awesome writer, director, never been anything short of happy with any of hus flicks, a must see"
5,A+,The product was shipped very fast and in perfect working condition. Had no problems with it what so ever. It came new and sealed as if I bought it straight from the store.
2,torture as comedy,"I'll never forget the (very long) torture scene: ear cut off, victim doused in gasoline--and hearing young men in the audience laughing like it was a Woody Allen comedy. Way to go Quentin. Nothing like prolonged graphic violence for a good chuckle!"
1,"Revolting, unsatisfying","The ONLY reason this video is in my home is because it is my husband's video. The movie lacks a plot, or any real substance. The level of violence is completely unneccessary and gory. Despite starring some of Hollywood's heavyweights, it is a true let-down. If you are looking for action, appropriate violence and a REAl plot, investigate Tarantino's masterful ""True Romance."""
3,It was a long wait to recieve the status on my order,The Product I ordered never arrived because of some unavailability problem. Although when I contacted the vendor by email she was prompt with her response and I was issued a full refund.
4,Res-Dogs Review,"I love Terantino's movies, by far my favorite being the Kill Bill movies. Res-Dogs remade unto Blu-ray is great. The only problem I have with this movie like other movies that weren't originally made with HD filming is that they are not as clear as movies that are now being filmed in HD. Sure the image is a lot clearer than the DVD version and the sound quality as well, but much like movies that first came out in VHS and then reformatted for DVD or black and white movies that are re-made in color, the quality is still not as good as the movies that were made for that format. But I totally recommend it for Terantino fans who want to see it in a better format and the ""Blu-vision"" or whatever it is called is great because it pops up with interesting facts based on the movie or the people that had to due with the movie such as the director and the actors."
3,"Great movie, but doesn't utilize Blu-ray well","I am not commenting the quality of the movie (which is great), but just the Blu-ray edition.In a nutshell, the movie is very grainy and does not utilize HD well. However, I assume this is due to the quality of the original material.So if you already own this as a DVD, there's really no reason buying it. If you don't (such as myself), then it might still be a good reason to add it to your Tarentino collection."
5,Classic,"Ocean's Eleven was good, but mediocre compared to this film. I can't fathom the idiocy of no taste reviewers giving this classic film one out of five stars. There's no way in the world this movie achieved a one star rating. This movie was all about taking risks. It differs from the other clone movies, such as Ocean's Eleven. Which continued to follow suit like all other movies and making it so that the movie go-er can sit back and just put their mind on autopilot, letting the movie do all the thinking for them. This film actually involed the audience this time, and asked them to think."
1,WHY Is This Movie So Popular?,"Is it its' own publicity? Is it a rite of passage to hip-hopping youth? WHY is this movie so popular. I could'nt STAND it! All it is guys in black suits talking like gangsters and puking up potential tag-lines in every seen. This is nothing compared to 'Pulp Fiction', which relies more on its' content, story and puzzle-like directing effect. THIS movie reminds me of drama class in college when everybody wants to be sophisticated and well-dressed with a gun and a New Yawk accent. Theres' nothing special about it, don't believe the hype cause thats' all it is...hype. Steve Buscemi's performance I thought was some of the worst acting in a big-production movie I've ever seen, I'd rank this right up there with Kung Fu Shuffle and Big Momma's House...save it for double-feature night in Da Bronx."
5,"Great Movie, lightweight DVD","This movie is great, and you don't see the ear being cut off contrary to popular belief.There isn't much else on the DVD except to flip it over and watch the 4:3 aspect versionI'm giving 5 for the movie. I'd give 1 for the DVD package"
5,Watch this one w/your Grandmother!,"Well, Considering it's Tarentino's first major picture...I can definitely say it's a gem among sh*t....the majority of all movies are complete garbage, so it's crazy to find such a great movie from a new director. There's no use in going over the plot as 80% of the other reviews already do that....so all i can really say is if you're interested in seeing a Shoot em' up flick that actually has good writing and actual unique cinematography....check out Reservoir Dogs. I'de Also recommend Tarentino's other films...esspecially Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill."
4,Reservoir dogs,Classic Tarantino film. This movie is what his film making is about. If you can't understand his thinking and way if directing you will never be able to really enjoy his movies.
1,Poor marketing,I live in Australia and you sent me a US zone copy which I cannot playon my blue-ray. Amazons Boo Boo.
1,I HATE IT,This movie is SO boring. Pulp Fiction is way better. Off-beat dialogue and INDIE do not a good movie make. I'm sick to death of everyone in the world thinking that if it's an INDIE movie it MUST be good. in this case it certainly is NOT!
1,"Really lame, nothing new for limp","This Durst guy can really get on your nerves. He's so annoying with his bragging and his i-am-cooler-than-thou trip. And the way he sometimes kind of yodels is so ridiculous, but of course fits the ridiculous music. How many times does he say ""rolling"", I lost count. Did I mention how annoying it is? Go listen to some REAL metal, such as Pantera, Slayer, Cannibal Corpse, or Black Sabbath. Or to those who really know how to mix rap with rock and do it honestly - Rage Against the Machine and the Chili Peppers - they did it first, when it wasn't the mainstream thing to do yet. These guys are just posers, jumping on the bandwagon just to capitalize on the trend of the moment. All their cds are the same, especially the chocolate hot dog or whatever the stupid name of the cd is, it's the worst of the worst. Word."
5,Fantastic work bag!,"I work as a leasing consultant in a major city (I.E. I find people apartments) and this bag is literally perfect for the job. Between built in filing, space for a notebook, the main compartment for a binder, a bottle holder, and the ever-so-great built in key organizer, this bag is it. If you're a professional who needs mobility and durability, not to mention style, look no further."
1,"silly, improbable mess","a friend of mine recommended this book a while ago and i decided to give it a try. what a waste of time! after a so-so start it dissolves into a silly, improbable, absolutely unbelievable mess, the conclusion being particularly stupid and unrealistic. if you want to do yourself a favour, stay with patricia highsmith instead."
4,Okay...adds fun to kitchen play,"The material was very thin and the meat slices are very small. They don't match the quality of the bread. Just printed details on circles of felt. I guess since they are small and thin, kids can pile more into the sandwich. They tend to scatter and get lost easily. As a parent, I wasn't overjoyed with the product, especially coming from Haba, my all time favorite toy company that usually surpasses my highest expectations."
2,a boring book,"this book wasn't so interesting for me.I expected a series of photos with the life of the actor, meanwhile there is only a long list of his participations in movies or shows in theatre."
2,Boo! Hiss! to V.C. ghostwriters on this one!!!!!,"""Lightning Strikes"" is the second installment in the Hudson series. I really had a hard time getting into this second installment....not only were the characters pretty dull and boring...but Rain disappoints me with her behavior with the men she encounters along her journey in London."
2,Lightening Keeps Striking,"All of VC Andrews books revisit the same themes: incest between siblings, a female protagonist who has an artistic aptitude - Cathy a dancer (Dollangager series), the aptly named Melody a musician, Raven sang (Runaway series) and Misty of the Wildflowers series like Melody, was also musical. Rain, the newest protagonist revisits all of these themes and parallel concepts by having an aptitude for acting and by having feelings for her half brother. The only departure from the Cliche Andrews or vintage Andrews, if you will, is that this is the first interracial character. That adds an interesting new element."
4,would really rate it 3.5,"i enjoyed this one, but i always say if you've read one v.c andrews story, you've read them all. just curious though, did anyone else catch the continuity error between ""rain"" and ""lightning strikes?"" near the end of ""rain"" she flies off to be with her beloved, dying Mama. at the beginning of this one, as jake is driving her to the airport to depart for london, she tells him she has never flown before. hmmmmmmmm? still an okay read. as usual she's perfect and everyone around her is sick and perverted and out to get her. just what we're looking for in a v.c. andrews book. i hope they never change."
2,Predictable,It's been said that all VC Andrews books are predictable. They are. I didn't like the way Rain ended up sleeping with Roy. They were raised like siblings. It insults your intelligence when Roy puts on that stupid act of not knowing who Rain is when they sleep together. It is a tired old story. VC Andrews books are pretty much all the same.
3,Smell wonderful but no flavor.,"I felt like it i was tasting water instead of coffee, i dont know but somehow this coffee brew out really really light, and no flavor, but the smell is great, i dont know how they done it, but the smell of bana nut creme is so good, make u want to sip the coffee, but once u sip it it full of disappointment, i give a 3 star for being average, if u like to drink coffee without the strong aroma and flavor, then this is for you, I already order some french roast on the way.."
5,Preponderant Lovecraft has no comparison in the horror genre,"This book is without question an astounding piece of horror literature. With such classics as The Dunwich Horror, The Call of the Cthulhu and other shuddersome stories, H.P. Lovecraft creates a world in which the supernatural ingress the real world and makes its hideous presence felt.No other author can adequately replicate H.P. Lovecraft except during the times when they're trying (often with great disappointment) to be like Lovecraft. They, at best, plummet in their endeavors as a feeble simulacrum of the real master of horror. If you like horror and have never read Lovecraft, you either don't like horror as much as you think you do, or you have been missing out on a formidable force who has influenced just about every horror writer alive today."
4,Great collection,"This is part of a (3?) volume set of corrected Lovecraft texts from Arkham House. Either this, or del rey's ""tales of horror and death"" is a good way to start if you've never read Lovecraft, although Dunwich Horror primary focuses on one side of his writing (poe-ish) and the other on the dunsday-ish. As far as the book iself, it looks like the publisher picked the best of materials, texts, and fonts, and then did a slapdash job of gluing it together :("
5,The best stories from the master of horror.,"Most of H.P.'s greatest stories are collected in this volume, from his best horror tales to some of the best Cthulhu myths stories. Required reading for any H.P. Lovecraft fan. I used to read this book in High School, usually around midnight and it scared me to death..."
5,This bag is great!,"I purchased this bag before our son was born - he is two months old now, and it has been a great diaper bag to have! It is very spacious and has room for everything that you would need to carry for your baby - and it also has a section to carry the 'parent' essentials - if you do not want to lug a purse around. The pattern is great because it is attractive but does not look overly feminine or masculine - so both parents can feel good carrying it around. The diaper bag also comes with a changing mat that is easy to clean and great for when you are changing diapers on the go! I would recommend this diaper bag to anyone - a good product for a good price."
1,PIECE OF JUNK,I bouught this clock back in June from another seller on Amazon.com. It is a piece of junk. I've had to change the 2-D batteries every month because the clock drains them so fast. VERY DISAPPOINTED and have tossed it in the garbage!
4,Great Price,I have had this system for at least 10 years and it has outlasted a tv and a receiver. The quality and sound reproduction is without equal in everything but the very best home theater. Through all this time I have never heard one crackle from any of the speakers and often times at full volume. Right now I'm driving the system with an Onkyo TX-SR608 and I mean drive. At $800 it's a super buy.
2,More like UPTOWN baby,"I read the first two reviews above before I bought the book and bought it anyway, figuring it was probably going be a useful reference, even if it was Manhattan-centric. Unfortunately, the book turns out to be written exclusively for uptown yuppies. This is a quote from the introduction to the ""from health care to day care"" chapter: ""We have each changed nannies several times since the first edition....""Don't bother. It's unfortunate that, with the enormous amount of resources in NYC, no one's yet put together a decent guide for real parents."
2,Not up to QA standards,"This looks like a transfer to DVD from a blurry VHS EP mode source. The picture quality detracted from the total enjoyment of the feature. The sound was also flat. You can only improve the film quality a tiny notch inspite of all the adjustment you make on the TV set. But since this is the only one available on DVD for this Rex Allen film, I suggest you get it. Very atypical of Alpha to come up with a release of this quality."
3,Fine and Super Fine.,"This is a beautiful pepper grinder that is built solidly. It is simple to operate, to disassemble, and to clean. It also produces a large quantity of pepper with minimal effort.The only complaint I can muster, granted it is a substantial one, is that the range of coarseness or fineness is very small. Indeed, if one were to ask me to discern the difference between the product of the coarsest setting and the finest setting I would be hard pressed to provide and answer; they are both very fine. I liken the difference to that of powdered sugar and baking soda. I even went through lengths to ensure my grinder was not faulty, and indeed nothing was wrong with it.The pepper mill is excellent for fine pepper; however its extreme lack of versatility especially coupled with the price makes this product worthy of only 3 stars."
5,My favorite,This works really good. I like it so well I bought one for my sister. Very easy to clean and use.
5,Enthralling CD of enchantment!,"This envoking CD is joyful and enchanting! The playful and up lifting song, Linus and Lucy, reminds me of the times at Christmas, watching the Peanuts special with my family. I will always keep this CD in my player and never take it out! I am addicted to this CD. It is rich in character and will make anyone smile."
2,My first George Winston disappointment.,"I've been a George Winston aficianado for years, and I didn't think he'd ever issue an album I wouldn't like, but now he has. I suppose it would have been okay if I weren't also a Vince Guaraldi fanatic, which is why I bought the CD. But Winston goes to such extremes to differentiate his style from Guaraldi's that all the charm and spontaneity of the original music is lost in the chaos of rearrangement. If you're a Winston fan and have never heard Guaraldi (although it's hard to imagine that you haven't, given the ubiquitous success of ""Linus and Lucy""), you might want to buy this. If you're a Vince Guaraldi fan, forget it. Mine went into the ""Used CD Store"" pile after the second playing."
5,Cocoa Cookbook,My copy disintegrated and I have been looking for another copy. I am glad I found it.
4,Great invention!,I got this for my daughter who is expecting twins. She says it is very helpful but keeps the babies up high. She works at a job that requires standing on her feet all day and says it really helps.
5,Worked Wonders,I was 30 weeks when my hip started going in and out of joint. My Dr. recommended this brace. I purchased it at 32 weeks and within 2 days my hip problems were almost completely gone.
2,Not as much support as it claims,"This product received great reviews, however, when I received it and tried it on, all the bells and whistles carried no support. I felt just as much support without the straps as with the straps. Moreover, they pulled on my shoulders, making my entire back lean forward. The product did not scream ""quality."" Cheaper fabric and kind of flimzy. Did not work for me at all."
5,clean and concise,"It has a very good style of writing for the nature of mathematics. It is clean, no unnecessary explanation or examples. In a way, one can feel something similar to Axler's. It is an excellent reference book. One should keep this book just as Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right, Numerical Recipe, DE Knuth's Art of Programming."
2,Much more advanced than expected,"This book is more advanced than the description leads you to believe. This is not a book for beginners. Some theorems from real analysis and functional analysis not proved are mentioned by name but not even quoted. Not even the introduction tells the reader that real analysis and functional analysis are needed to understand the book. Besides that, the index is very incomplete. It seems to have been prepared by randomly picking pages."
3,Billie Holiday does not sing here anymore,"I purchased this Remixed CD because I want to enjoy another experience with Billie Holiday. The music is not Billie but dance club music. She is there in spirit and in the background but not singing soulfully. This interpretation is interesting; however it is fulled with instrumental and not Billie singing. #13 But Beautiful is sounding like ""another one bites the dust"". I think that some DJ somewhere is enjoying this recording; however if you are looking for Billie she is not here."
5,"HOT!!!!! If you love Trip Hop, House, and acid Jazz, this remix is for you!!!!","Every song is perfectly remixed with an ambiance of House, Down Tempo, Trip Hop, Funk, and Acid Jazz. If you want to hear Billie Holiday in her natural style then buy the original Billie CD's but if you love remixes that take the past and make it a blast for todays generation, this is it!!! The flow of the CD never misses a beat. Each song is perfect in its remix style. This is much better then the Nina remix because it's smoother and the producers really meshed Billie Holidays vocals and original music to the new remix style they intended. Once again, if your looking for original Billie this is not the CD for you but if you want original Billie with a bit of Cayenne Pepper this is it!!!!"
1,buyer beware on this one,"The first time I purchased this printer, it had such serious problems that the tech people said I should return it. I exchanged it for another one and a whole set of new problems. The tech people said they are receiving all kinds of calls on this new model."
1,Automatic feeder is horrible,In less than 3 months I am on the third replacement under warranty.First time the store replaced. Problems occurred within 30 days.Second time HP sent me a replacement product. Problems started in 2 days.I'm on the phone again with HP to see what they will do now.Very time consuming dealing with customer service.Consistent problems with feeder not working and jamming problems.I understand HP has discontinued this model. Very good reason...it is junk.Do not buy!
1,Worst HP ever!!!,"This unit has never worked properly. First - software won't install properly in either Windows or Mac. I have never been able to use the various software features. Windows fails to recognise double-sided printing (though Mac does). Second, Scanning through document loader always leads to crooked scans. Third, after 6 months, fatal ""printhead has a problem"" arose. Google this and you'll see it's a fatal non-recoverable problem with the unit. Printer now junked. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
1,ABSOLUTELY do not buy,"I have two of these printers and have had nothing but trouble--avoid these like the plague. Numerous print quality issues--won't print in cyan, streaks in black--and HP's solutions are to replace the expensive ink cartridges and even more expensive print heads. HP support is abysmal. I will probably never purchase an HP product again after this experience."
1,It is a piece of Junk,"I am on my second 7680 and frankly I wish I had never purchased it. I have accessed many tech sites and all say the same. Fails to install, and hangs up at 96% during the installation. Scanner will not work either except with MS own software.The worst part is that HP knows about it and will not do anything to fix the issue.Do not purchase this product as the only install that works is the initial time. If you have to do the installation a second time, you will have to rebuild your system to get it to work."
3,L7680 not all it is cracked up to be,"Okay, so i needed to replace my laser printer, hit the stores, checked them all out.i've had good luck with hp, love my 5550 photo printer, so went for the 7680. used the first one maybe a month before it started eating the paper as it printed. CS was polite, but of no help. Finally said i need this printer for work - i had a new one on my porch within 3 days. They paid shipping to me and for first ones return.So far so good, but have the same complaints:Noisey and won't scan properly. i can live with the noise, as the prints are nearly as good as the laser and the color is incredible, but the scanner not working properly is enough of a problem i won't purchase another one.maybe gen II will be better.Sharon"
1,HP Fails yet again,"this is the last time i will ever buy an hp product. not only did this product arrive dead in the box but after speaking with 3 people (none of which had english as a first language) i was asked the same questions over and over and not one bit of progress was made.i don't care where the call center is, but if you sell a product in an english market to an english speaker for godsake, get some tech support that can speak to me so i can understand.this is the 3rd bs product from hp and the last.i have no review of the actual product because it never worked.urgh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Piece of Junk,Nothing but problems since the beginning. Problems with two sided printing (paper jams). Problems with scanning (locks up and does nothing). Problems with ink cartridges (says new ones are empty). Avoid like the plague. I won't purchase HP again.
1,Hate it.,Don't bother. It won't black pages unless it has all three color cartidges in. It got some network problem that won't allow it to print in a network. It loses its drivers and won't scan to email and the computer. There's so much extra crap in programming that it just overtakes the computer memory. This is the last HP we will ever buy. We're done.
1,HP all-in-one printers are bad news,"How frustrating it was to get conned into buying this from the HP Sales Rep at Best Buy. This printer is sucks. I've spent more time trying to just use the stupid thing. Now for the past 3 months I can't scan to memory device, which is extremely important for my small business. I wish Apple would make a printer, as their products tend to just work without frustrating uninstalling/re-installing. To make things worse I travel across country for thanksgiving to my dad's place, only to find they need help to get their printer working. Guess what, it's an all-in-one HP printer. My advise for them was to recycle the boat anchor. She didn't like my advise so she threw more money at it to have the geek squad come out and get it working. HP you should be ashamed to sell this crap. The hardware itself is fine, it's the software that runs the printer that is the problem.HP Officejet Pro L7680 Color All-in-One Printer"
4,really good buy,"I ordered this bag thinking it would be a little larger than it is, but it's still a good buy. my husband has an alabama bag that our son gave him for his birthday a few years ago that he bought locally at an Alabama store in Tuscaloosa and i was hoping this was the same size. Although it is smaller, it's the right size for what my grandson needs it for .. overnight/weekend stays with friends. The construction is great, the pockets are roomy and easily accessible and the fabric is sturdy. Overall, it's a really good buy."
5,Better made than I expected,"I got this bag to show off my support for UGA in a UVA dominated state.It does that exceedingly well. Bright red and clear G logo.It also doubles as a very well designed bag. What a handy feature!some of my favorite features are:1) Light weight - it's easy to carry around and it doesn't have a lot of extra stuff built into it like useless frames etc.2) Secret compartment for dirty clothes. The 2 flaps on the end look like regular pockets but they are actually a 2nd ""main area."" There's a cloth divider that runs all the way under the main compartment. As you fill this up it simply takes up more space in the main area. It's the perfect spot for dirty clothes. It keeps them separate without taking up double the space.3) Plenty of space to carry around whatever. I kept the entire team's shirts in it without any problems."
4,AWESOME,I have always loved the wordless workshop from family handyman...and this compiles them all in one place.
5,These guys sing history like it should be!,"These three guys contribute to the sense of altruism that we all once had. Their sense of history, in their music, lets us all know that we may lean on our historical character to do what SHOULD be done, and be comfortable in the fact that we aren't the first to try. Can""t wait for the next one and hope to see you in Rockland next Jun/July."
3,Only For Dickens Fans!,"This work is all the more mysterious that Dickens died before finishing it and left no clear indication as to its resolution. Apparently, dozens of hypotheses have been devised and debated since it was published almost a century and a half ago.Yet, the story about the novel is perhaps more interesting than the work itself. As is frequently the case with Dickens' tales, the characters are numerous but they all lack depth. None is particularly engaging, including Edwin Drood and his fiancée. The plot and sub-plots are thin and largely predictable. Dialogues are artificial and drawn-out. Dickens' trademark tongue-in-cheek is remarkably absent.It must be pointed out however that the audio rendition is impeccable, with a touch of music inserted between chapters to lighten things up.Overall, though, this work can only be recommended to die-hard Dickens fans."
4,A book about nothing....who knew?,I found this book at my daughters' book fair this year and immediately purchased it. A wonderful view of what we really (really) need at the holiday times. I have since sent copies to other (grown-up) friends for them to share.
5,Best gift for those who don't celebrate,It's hard times when you have a close friend whose religion has them not celebrating holidays or such but when I saw this I was happy that I can sneak it passed that little by-law of religion. I have to say this is a wonderful book and I had to get a copy even for myself!
5,Perfect for Everyone,"this is perfect for anyone - from children to just people you lovethe gift of nothing is beautiful, and you should share it with everyone. i chose this as a birthday gift for my mother - who, consequently, has given me everything and nothing. i feel it is only right to give the same back. ;)"
4,"Good fit, good price, limited availability.","I know platform boots of this style look intimidating but they're surprisingly comfortable to wear. I wear mine all day long. Pleaser brand has never let me down. They're a true-to-size fit, affordable, and are quality boots. The only bad thing I'd say is that the shaft width is too small. If a person has muscular or fatter calves the boots won't fit. Most seem to only give a 13-14 inch diameter. Larger women like me would fare better with a 17 inch opening but even with the laces spread they won't fit. Especially buckled boots, I've returned many adorable boots with buckles on account of my larger calves.That's my only negative statement, I wish Pleaser would make the Electra foot style with larger calves. This particular model is the only one that fits because it's shorter in height. I want knee-high boots like this but they don't make them for bigger girls. I'll keep buying what I can from this company though, because they're great boots."
5,Great toy for finky cats,My cat absolutely loves this mobile. She's very picky about toys but this has withstood the test of time.
5,Psagent is a must read!,"If you purchase no other book this year, you should read Psagent. ""Psagent"" is the coinage of Keith L. Partain, the author, for ""psi-agent"" or a practitioner of ESP, OBES and mind-over-matter. Partain, who has written the fast-becoming-classic Psi in the Sky, returns with startling insights into the origin of ancient calendars, Halloween and even Friday the 13th. He reports his own interface with ET races, strange magical forces and curious entites like Mothman. He gives us humor, acid wit and clear documentation of abuses in the New Age and the anomaly community and how analysis of data is more important (and safer) than anecdotes. Yes, buy this book!!!!!; and if you do buy another, also buy Psi in the Sky by the same author. These books are unique, well-documented and anything but cliche."
2,Depressing materialistic,"While Nora Ephron can be very clever, this book portrays her as a very shallow, materialistic person with no connection to the reality of a person with an average income. the last chapter is particularly depressing and I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,I FEEL BAD ABOUT MY NECK:AND OTHER THOUGHTS ON BEING A WOMAN,ONLY THE FIRST AND LAST CHAPTERS WERE REALLY GOOD.I EXPECTGED THIS TO BE A SERIOUS/FUNNY TAKE ON WOMEN'S AGING NOT MOSTLY DEVOTED TO HER RELATIONSHIPS WITH MEN..THE AUTHOR WAS ON OPRAH AND WAS REALLY INTERESTING AND WITH OPRAH BEHIND IT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE VERY GOOD..I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT...
4,LOve Nora Ephron,Loved this so much I bought it as a gift too! I would highly recommend her- fabulous author and very poignant
3,Nora Ephron: When Nora Met Her Neck.,"Does this book deserve a Pulitzer? No. Is it up to some of her other work, for example, Sleepless in Seattle? Can't say it is. But is it a good light read with a couple profound thoughts sprinkled here and there? You bet. Ephron shouldn't feel bad about her neck or anything else, including this book. It is what it is, we are what we are...and when in doubt, thank God there's chocolate. Diana BlackWOOF: Women Only Over Fifty"
1,Self-indulgent pretension,"I cannot believe this book was published. The author comes off as a shallow idiot who actually expects readers to enjoy/sympathize with/relate to her writing about her vapid life. She has nothing new to say and doesn't say anything well. She whines about getting old. She's also cushioned against many of the problems of the elderly due to her wealth. Since this book was a complete waste of my time, the only positive thing I have to say about it is that it's short."
3,Not that much of a feel good book,"Okay, I know this is chic lit, which generally is just a lot of fun but not a lot of substance, but even so I was dissapointed. Where was the fun? Most of the little diddies in this book were rehash that just weren't that good to begin with. Trite is the best word I can come up with to describe it. Chic lit does not have to be bad, there is some very feel good entertaining reading for women that is better, like 'Enchanted' by Nancy Madore, 'This is not Chick Lit' by Elizabeth Merrick, and The Guy I'm Not Dating by Trish Perry."
3,Medium,Definitely average in my opinion. I liked a couple of the essays but overall thought the author was trying too hard to be clever and funny (Purses)in several others.
5,I feel back about my neck: and other thoughts on being a woman,I shared this book with all my women friends and they ran to get a copy immediately. I resumed to use neck creame after I read this book.
2,so short,"Pleasant little read, ""little"" being the operative word... At seven bucks, this cheapskate feels kinda ripped off.This *could* have been a nice book, with a lot of fleshing-out."
1,I feel bad about buying this book,"While the author may be a respected writer, this book is a poor example of her work. She rambles on about nothing, drops names and brags about herself and her finances. Where are her ""thoughts on being a woman"" when she rambles on about her high priced apartment? It was not insightful, not funny and really not what I expected."
1,Quit yer whining,"Although this book has been touted as hilarious and so trendy, I found it overwhelmingly boring. I saw the author on Oprah and thought it might be a good laugh, but, no! Got really tired of all her whining. But, so many books right now are being published that are nothing but somebody whining about their life. I just think it is really sad what popular literature has come to. I haven't recommended this book to anyone and won't. Thank goodness I got it from the library or I would be really ticked."
5,you'll laugh and nod!,Nora Ephron has taken all the things we secretly confess to girlfriends and put them on paper! You'll laugh and nod as you see yourself! A warm and friendly read. I keep it on the coffee table in my dress shop to share!
5,"Great, fast read","This book is laugh out loud funny! Ladies, relax, accept it, and enjoy the humor of it!"
5,Fun Quick Read,"I just finished this book and I'm really glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews that some readers posted. This book is a quick (I read the entire book in one sitting) and fun read. Basically a series of essays on a variety of subjects, (purses, lipstick, NY apartments, divorce, kids, etc). I didn't find the stories depressing. They are written in a light fun manner. This is not heavy literature or an in depth psychological discussion. Its just observations about her life."
5,One of my favorites,"I love this book, she had me in tears I was laughing so hard. How sad Nora Ephron has passed she was a witty and joyful author and will be missed!"
5,I Feel Bad About My Neck,Very fun book. I loved reading it and I agree with a lot of what Ephron says. We're really going to miss her and her humor.
4,A Fun Read,"This is a very quick, entertaining read. Great for an airplane ride or while sitting in a doctor's waiting room. It's funny, interesting, and any woman over 50 will relate."
2,"dull, duller and dullest","I would have thought a woman older than myself would have had more wisdom to share. The funniest thing about this book was the title. After that, it was a waste of money....dull, duller and dullest. I believe her history of writing satire is what sold this book, surely not the content.But then again women who are so hysterical about aging, and their necks may not have much content."
2,I feel bad about my service,"I ordered this book from this seller, and the picture shown was the newer cover, released in 2008....the book I actually received was the old cover, the 2006 released. Since I was buying it as a gift that was part of a joke, the really relied on the picture, I was VERY disappointed. I feel the seller should warn the buyer if they do not have the book shown, and will be replacing it with a lesser book. Also, the shipping package was very thin and did not properly protect the book...it came with a bent corner that appeared to happen in transit. Not impressed with this transaction."
4,Perfect birthday present,"I received this book as a present for my fif*mumble*th birthday. It was perfect. The only downside is now I am overly aware of my neck. So far, it's fine; but now I know that some morning I will look into the mirror and find out that overnight, SOMETHING AWFUL has happened.Until then, I will invest in scarves so I will be prepared for the inevitable."
2,Overrated,I found this book boring after the first chapter. I gave it away and would not recommend you buy it. It's highly overrated.
4,A witty little book about the passage of time,"I Feel Bad About My Neck contains all of the things that Nora Ephron finds lamentable about growing older. This book is just as funny as you would expect from the same woman who gave us When Harry Met Sally and Sleepless in Seattle. It also contains sage advice and witty commentary about everyday life. Ephron's discussions include everything from why you should buy and not rent to the pitfalls of owning too many skincare products. It's also less than two hundred pages and a very fast and upbeat read. I think this book is good for women any age, so don't be discouraged into thinking it's going to be a depressing rant about downside of getting older. Instead, Ephron gives us an inside look into her thoughts on the passage of time from someone who's been there and done that. This would be a great book to read in the bathtub or nail salon when you're relaxing and in the mood for a chuckle."
4,funny!,"You will love her!!! She speaks to every women about from cooking to your purse!!! Hilarious! It worth the price I paid for the book, a quick read!"
2,"Words, words, and more words","I can appreciate someone putting their heart into writing something monumental like this. But is/was it really neccessary? Read the bible, pray to God for enlightenment, and understanding of His will. This is what happens when a man believes he has to add so much more to what God has already said, and thereby confusing the whole purpose of God giving us His word to read. It is so simple: Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved. If you need to know what from? We are sinful creatures, seperated from God. Only by the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross are we able to stand before our Creator, redeemed, bought with the blood Christ shed on the cross. And as He was raised from the dead, to spend eternity with God in heaven, are we able to do so also. Now, does this not sum up 17, or 31 volumes of long-winded, exegesis? Know where I got all my info? I read God's Word, and pray for wisdom."
3,Cute doll but too heavy for toddlers,"I bought this doll for my daughter for Christmas last year. It's very cute and cuddly, but when it's filled with water it's really heavy. It might be OK for a school-age child, but for a toddler, it's too heavy to be carried around easily. I also had quite a difficult time filling it. The funnel doesn't fit in snugly and it's awkward because the water keeps seeping back out the hole since the doll has to be held horizontally while filling it. The doll also ended up getting a puncture in it after about 6 months. My daughter enjoys the doll better when it's empty anyhow! I think these dolls aren't designed too well - keep the cute faces and outfits, but make them with cloth bodies and they'd be great!"
3,A let down.,"Okay, a lot of people will feel let down and betrayed by this final installment of the series. I was! So I went back and re-read the entire series just to get a perspective on the characters without getting sidetracke by the plot twists. In hindsight, you can see the logical conclusion to each of Maupin's characters, especially Mary Ann. This is the woman who left Cleveland and jumped into the mainstream to get ahead in life. Here she is, doing it again! What really baffles me is Mona's fate . . . but then again, Mona was always an enigma to me. Throughout the series, the writing has always been true and outrageous. You won't regret the time you spend with these folks at 28 Barbary Lane. Bravo Mr. Maupin!"
4,The book that makes you hate Mary Ann Singleton,"Okay...I adored Mary Ann. I adored her for years. When I moved to NYC, I was given all six Tales of the City books as a present. I would read them and immediately recognize myself as sort of the little lost lamb. For five books, I loved her. Now I hate her. How could you make me hate her?!?!? But I am so glad you did...made me take another look at her and what she is supposed to be made of. However, I think the most enduring person is Anna Madrigal. Finally finding love in Greece (she predicted it in an earlier book) and Mona coming back after being gone for so long. Sigh....it's not the best of the bunch but the door is left opento pick up for a seventh installment...just to see if Mary Ann gets her comeuppance."
3,Readers need to be warned about persistent present tense!,"I ABHOR modern novels that are written entirely in the present tense. Call me Jurassic, but I just find them unreadable -- flat and artificial. I took this book out of the library. As a soon-to-be expat in Mexico, I was really looking forward to the story. Had I purchased it based on favorable reviews, I would have been beside myself with rage. I gave it three stars because you have to give stars to post a review, and less than three seems unfair since others seem to like the book. But -- be forewarned."
5,"Beautiful, sensitive, and timeless portrayal of a family","I first saw this in college. I was overwhelmed by the quiet but poignant characterizations and plot development centering around an elderly couple's trip to Tokyo to see their grown children and grandchildren, and the subsequent funeral of the grandmother after she suffers a fatal stroke upon the couple's return to the little seaside town of Onomichi. The director of this film, Yasujiro Ozu, has been called the most ""Japanese"" of the great Japanese directors, and this is certainly his masterpiece; indeed, many critics consider it the greatest film ever made in Japan. A must for connoisseurs of world cinema and Japanese culture."
1,not worth watching,"i would give this film zero stars, but it won't let me.this is a realist film. it's long, and it's boring. not that i hate realist films. but this one is predictable, and i was waiting the whole time for the end to come. i guess i'm just unsympathetic to what others called ""insight to the human condition."" just because others consider this a classic, doesn't mean you have to."
5,A 180-degee turn away from Allen's comedies,"This film is moody, brooding, stark, and even the gray and tan costumes complement the colors of the beach house's interiors. The interiors of the rooms, in fact, mirror the insides of each person in this family, from the man who wants out of his marriage to the woman who wants to remain in it to the three daughters whose own relationships are suffering.A fine cast including some Allen regulars like Diane Keaton, as well as a young Sam Waterston, give powerful performances here."
2,where's the movie?,"I can give this ""product"" (the Amazon rental) which I was asked to review no more than a 2-star ""I don't like it"" because I have not been able to watch it. Amazon provides no instruction how the rental can be downloaded to a thumb drive to watch on a HDTV. I'm now thinking that, perhaps, it can't be done. What a waste. This is not a ""rental,"" as described but, rather, a video on demand for streaming only. If that's the case, let's make it clear from the outset."
1,Item did not state regional restrictions,"The DVD ad did not state that there were regional limitations, i.e., the DVD I purchased and sent to a friend out of town, could only be played in Great Britain. I am still waiting for my friend to return the DVD to me so I can return it. In addition to not knowing about these ""regions"", I was told my the seller that I was still going to be charged shipping fees to me and would have to pay return shipping fees. I complained to Amazon and have been told they would credit me with the shipping fees."
2,Disappointing,"I am someone who believes the best way to appreciate Burroughs, is to hear him read his own work. This set of recordings however lacks ""production"". It consists mainly of live recordings of readings, where the sicophantic laughter of the audience is extremely intrusive.It does of course contain good material but lots of crap too. I say go with ""produced"" recordings such as ""Dead City Radio"", ""Spare Ass Annie"" or the excellent penguin audio book ""Junky""."
1,Too dumb to read,I read a few chapters and gave up in disgust. How on EARTH did this stupid book get published????
2,This game STINKS!,"The games graphics are pretty good, but the gameplay is REALLY bad!The music is bad too, I mean, who's heard of ""the sloppy meat eaters?""All in all I rate this game a 2 out of 10."
4,Captures the turn of the century beauty of the Parks,Very interesting read !!!!! Describes in the words of Mark Twain and others the National Parks beauty around 1919. What I enjoyed was the history of each National Park.: who explored and documented their mystic wonder and the Indian accounts in the old west.
3,Nice Projects,"The book is nice and the project are beautiful, but you do need several tools (scrolls saw, router table, router bits, chisels or a mortise jib, table saw and possibly a drill press)and knowledge how to use them as there are several different types of joints the author uses.As others said, I found the instructions a bit ""off"" especially for beginners who don't know how to ""look"" at a project but slowly work their way step by step. I did have to make some adjustments due to the not-so-clear instructions. That being said, I learned a lot from my first project (the bed) and am looking forward to other projects."
4,Use these almost every day!,I really love this set! I am starting fresh and needed something that wasn't a hand me down but was something that is a bit sturdier and really feels nice to use. So far they fit the bill greatly! The one draw back is that their are rivets on the inside so there is the slight possibility that food could get under there and is just harder to clean (reason for 4 instead of 5 stars). I do like the weight of them and am very glad to have these as my staples in kitchen ware.
4,"I feel that the title should have reflected ""promises kept""!","I agree that this story was lacking in it's motivation and other details having to do with the murderer's psyche.The two main characters, Ben and China,while meeting under such tragic circumstances, compliment each other and seem destined to face their challenges together and overcome them.Ben may seem to overdue the ""honey"" but I can't fault the sincerity of his feelings for China and the love that builds between them.As for the mystery woman with the long blonde hair that commits the murders, I had a pretty good idea who was guilty, but the puzzle didn't fit exactly right,even in the end.I still enjoyed the book. Ben and China were worth the time!!"
3,Not what I expected!!!,"The book I have is paperback with the the Disney characters of Miss Bianca and Bernard on the cover. The book was rereleased in 1977. The illustrations are done by Garth Williams.This book was not what I expected. I expected a version of the Disney animated film with some differences. The only similarities of this book and the film are the characters Miss Bianca and Bernard, the Prisoners Aid Society, and that they are rescuing a child.Margery Sharps style of writing is different and it is difficult to understand what it is she is saying.The story is exciting and the characters of Nils the Norwegian sailor mouse and the feared Mamelaok the gaurd cat add to the story with their many exploits.The story gets better with each chapter. Stick with it, I think you will be glad you did."
3,Nothing Wonderful,"I didn't find much to be great about this game. This game took me about 3 days to beat. The graphics are ok but, the way you do the stunts and moving around on the corse is stupid and gets old really quick. If you want a really good BMX stunt biking game get for PC or some type of game consoul."
2,It isn't a bad guide,I don't have a huge problem with the guide other than that it is not needed. The game is very short and you could beat it in a rental. They aren't any powerup item to miss. I got lost twice and the guide did help me out then but that isn't worth the cost of buying a guide. Go to gamewinners if you stuck instead.
1,This isn't my Courtney!,"Pretty on the Inside is a cd that ultimately became a casualty in my music collection. First of all, I am not a Hole hater, I love the band of Courtney Love's screaming voice but this particular album is an absolute mess! The lyrics are somewhat hilarious but not much is being said and the music is non-cohesive. None of the songs are complete or brilliant. If you want a great Hole album then try Live Through This, My Body, The Hand Grenade or Celebrity Skin. Those are real and breathtaking albums. Discard Pretty on the Inside, it's not that beautiful kids."
1,i hate courtney love,courtney made this albulm without the help of kurt cobain or billy corgan and it shows. horrible.
5,look into the bloodroot,"this album is so dark and heavy and ugly nothing will ever touch it again.when something makes you uncomfortable, you have to explore it or your not a real artist. if you were molested, dont you wonder what makes a grown man want to have that power? this album reclaims and explores all those dirty feelings that are so personal we could never know what they mean to the writer. and its done with such passion that its complete. thats why hole changed so much and why courtney love is so great. wherever she is, thats where she is. and when its done shes gone.this album is beautiful because it makes you feel as ugly as you know the people who made it feel. the comparisons to teenage jesus? please. this is an original masterwork."
4,before all that sparkle... there was this hole,this album is all hole!!! is angry... is cleaver... is everything else and more.
5,Ministering through listening,"This book I found to be an awesome book for it lays out numerous suggestions on how to prepare oneself for the ministry of director, counselor, even just as a friend helping another, seeking help in christian growth, relationshiops, or emotions. It show that one doesn't have to be a professional counselor to be able to assist another.I found that it also helps one (the reader) to grow as well by taking a look inward, interiorly into the heart.Thanks Thomas N. Hart"
2,"Actually, I didn't think he was a very good teacher","Too much of the video was taken up watching the teacher perform the exercises. This isn't very helpful. You might pick up something if it were in slow motion (probably not even then), but what you really need is a good explanation before hand - which you don't get. At one point he suggests visualizing the chord shapes while practicing the scales, but doesn't really explain why that would be helpful. He also shows some licks, which just sound like noise to me (boring heavy metal noodling). I found the guitar louder than the talking so I needed to turn down the sound with the exercises and turn it up for the voice. Also, just from a personal preference perspective - why do we need distortion on the guitar? It just makes it sound more like noise."
1,Not What I Ordered,"I ordered White Diamonds EAU de Parfum and received EAU de Toilette. This product came from Target. Amazon was very good at giving me a complete refund and did not have me send the Toilette back.I then ordered the same thing directly from Target. The very same thing happened. Target has been more difficult to work with. Basically, I do all the work inorder to get a refund when the mistake is on their part. Amazon is great to work with."
4,worth it for the performances and Richard Hell,"In no way is this movie great ""Art"" but it is entertaining. Bouchet may have been beautiful, but incredibly bland while Hell was simply great fun to watch. Enjoyable, not even an arthouse winner, but still amusing and the performances are just great."
2,"Stories in a weary mood, not his best","I had greatly enjoyed the Rabbit books and the excellent ""Marry Me"" and was hoping for more of the same finely tuned and energetic writing, but found to my disappointment that many of the stories in this collection meander without much drive.The subject manner tends towards an autumnal sense of reflection; this monotony of tone reaches its extreme with two stories in a row that both concern a middle-aged man contemplating the death of his mother.One story, ""Cruise"", throws in something like magical realism apparently out of boredom with the same old formula, or maybe just to see if anyone's paying attention (like a student gluing the pages of a report together before turning it in).For Updike completists only."
3,cool to say you love it,"I've known of Pavement for a while. I know certain songs from pretty much every album. I know and love Stephen Malkmus' solo work, but everywhere that Pavement was mentioned it was all about Slanted and Enchanted, their so called brilliant and ground breaking debut. So I bought it...and was REALLY disappointed. If you think this is brilliant, I'm very jealous of how you will feel when you discover what truly brilliant music sounds like. As far as my opinion is concerned this is a perfectly nice out of the ordinary album with some nice songs and some less nice songs. The only song that stands out is ""Here"" (as mentioned in every single review of this album, trying to hold on to the one solid song on it) which really is quite moving, not moving enough though to make all the other songs sound less ordinary. My conclusion : someone back in the early 90's decided that this is the coolest album to claim as your favourite and the world followed. Beg to differ."
1,WHAT IS SO GREAT ABOUT THIS?,Please dont waste your money on this album. I tried so desperately to get my money back that I claimed it was scratched. It is poorly recorded (It sounds like it was recorded in someones garage) and is mostly made of terrible noise and senseless lyrics. I dont know how it got such great reviews.
1,Save yourself,"Don't buy this. Please, just don't do it. You may as well set fire to a 20 dollar bill or gouge your eyeballs out. Buy something worthy!"
4,The spirit of the age,"When I first listened to this album back in '92 I really wasn't convinced. My initial thought was ""These guys aren't trying very hard."" But after repeated listens Slanted & Enchanted started to really grow on me. Its not recorded well, the guitars are sometimes out of tune, the playing isn't all that competent and Steve Malkmus' disaffected and sometimes whiny voice is an aquired taste. So why did I keep playing it? Sometimes spirit and originality trumps a band's technical limitations. The ideas are fresh, and they have a personal take on rock music unlike any other band. I don't love this record (tho I do like it). For me Pavement improved with age but Slanted And Enchanted has a special slacker charm all it's own. It really didn't sound like much else around at the time yet somehow encapsulated a certain feeling that was in the air during the early '90s."
4,great comp,"This album already sounds dated, but it's still a very good compilation of ambient electronic works. There's also quite a bit of variety, from the cod-Middle Eastern wailing of ""Tarenah"" to the straightforward ""Solid Motion"" (pretty chucklesome) and the past-oral beauty of ""Past"". I've had it since its first release, and still play it occasionally."
3,"""Eye of The Storm"" follows formula","The ""V.C. Andrews"" books that have been written since her death all seem to follow a formula. This usually includes multiple deaths, one or more of which happens tragically; a young girl surrounded by strangers who are usually in some way related and some kind of abuse- either physical, emotional, or sexual. ""Eye of The Storm"" is no different. Much of the plot is reminiscent of previous novels in other series, and is also quite predictable. I still enjoyed reading the book, but found it not quite as exciting as I had predicted. Even with the dissapointment I had in ""Eye of The Storm"", I am still awaiting the publishing of the next book, ""The End of The Rainbow"", which comes out in February 2001. I am sure that the series wouldn't make much sense without ""Eye of The Storm"", but I am hoping ""The End of The Rainbow"" redeems it's predecessor."
1,The hanging light worked for 3 months and died,"I bought the Paradise hanging path light Nov. 5, 2013 and it died 5 days after Jan 390, 2013 return was allowed. Bought a new lamp, tried to replace it and still didn't work. Can't return it and no way to contact Amazon or Warehouse Deals by phone or email to complain. It was just $19.19 wasted."
5,Imation rocks!,I already had been using an Imation 2 Gig flash drive for about six months when my wife asked me to help her find a 4 Gig one. I didn't hesitate to reccommend this one as mine has always worked flawlessly. This one's even better because of the design with the rubber case. Great product!
2,Flimsy Shelf,"Overall, the structure is sturdy and functions well. However, as others have reported, the shelf is too weak and bends."
4,Freaky Friday,A good booka readerI thought this book was boring in the beginning thats why I gave it 4stars instead of 5 stars. I like the part when Annabelle switches places with her mother and gets in a lot of messes. I wonder what else is going to happen to her. She already forgot to pick up her brother from the bus stop and got in trouble by the police. Annabelle also ruined the washing machine and was late for a conference.
1,The kind of book babies would read,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be your mother for a day. Well now you don't have to wonder, you can know. This book tells the story of how a young girl Annabel Andrews becomes her mother for a day. Now she has the problem of finding her body with her mother inside of it, to turn them back. I didn't like Freaky friday, because it is the kind of book babies would read. It was boring. One bit I liked was when Annabel had to go and alk about herself to the school. I would recommend this novel for about 9 year olds. It is the kind of book parents could read to their kids."
5,freaky friday,"Freaky friday is about a mother and a daughter, and one morning thier bodies were switched. so, they tried everything to get back to thier own bodies. I liked it because it was weird and it has all different kinds of emotions, like, scared, surprized, happy, sad, and other feelings. I would like Mary Rodgers to write a freaky friday #2."
1,Thought it was terrible / unrealistic!,"I was handed down this book from another pregnant mother. I agree with another poster that this book creates a culture of fear. I have been trying to buy organic when I can, such as milk, meat, cleaners and a few facial products, but I just cannot afford to buy everything organic, not to mention not everything organic is necessarily available where I live. This book is informative, but extremely over the top. I felt like it told you that everything in your house, your products, produce, etc. has toxins that can cause cancer. I took the book to my OB and she told me that regular produce is healthy, just make sure to wash them and to stop reading the book! If you can afford to replace everything you own, or to only buy organic, then you might like this book. If you are easily worried, then I would refrain from buying."
2,Negatory.,"Just started Diane Ackerman's, _Natural History of Love_. I find it practically insufferable, but will give it a little more time, or will skip around some. The writing itself has nothing to commend it and the Western, late twentieth century, cultural/psycho-theraputic-ethno-centricity is uninteresting to the extreme.I've recently finished Alain de Botton's _On Love_, am reading Plato's _Phaedrus_, and thought this might be, uh, right up my alley.Negatory."
1,Test the mouse first!,"This mouse sounded just good, so I bought one. BIG MISTAKE! It was extremely uncomfortable and clumsy to use. I finally sold it and purchased a Targus rechargeable laser mouse -- it's super!!!"
2,For big hands,"I am an adult female and this mouse is too big for my hand. After a very short time, my hand starts to ache and I have to go back to my previous, smaller mouse. I have both of them active. I switch to this one when I need to magnify something - as that part works fairly well. I just wish the magnifying window was larger. I have to keep moving it around on the page to read anything - often just to finish a sentence."
3,Not bad,"I will say, that it has an amazing price, and it's been a good mouse after roughly 3 months of average-intensive use. Only problems I have with it is such1.) Takes 2 AA batteries, my others only took 1 AA and have seemed to last longer than this mouse that takes 22.) Everyone once in awhile it will stop/slow response dramatically, yet I'll check the connection and it'll say wireless connection and battery life are great. So that's confusing3.)The fifth button on the right side of the mouse has proven worthless to me, I have it inactive because I accidently hit it constantly. Not really a problem, more just a waste of a button.All in all it's a good mouse, the response problem has only happened twice that I can remember and lasted 30 minutes, give or take 5 minutes.Still a good mouse though, I'm sure I'll be using it for awhile."
1,Not For AutoCAD,"While this might be fine for everyday computing needs I would not recommend at all if you use CAD or any other graphic related software. Or any Microsoft mouse for that matter.The software creates a horrible flicker that I could not tolerate for even 5 minutes of use. This is a known issue with newer Intellipoint versions and Microsoft does not seem to care.I uninstalled the software and the flicker went away. However... there is still a slight, but definite, delay when you push the middle button (scroll wheel)to pan. When you do this about every 10 seconds a half second delay is not acceptable. Again a known issue (Google it) and Microsoft doesn't seem to care.Long story short... CAD people don't buy! If you do you'll be glad it's wireless. It will go a lot further when you throw it ;)"
3,window washer,The concept of this product is great and it works wells. The issue is the sponge part drips on the window when you are trying to squeegee it so it is hard to get the water off. There is no way to squeeze all the water out of the sponge before you squeegee. It would be better if it were to separate products.
2,sad!,I love scary movies!! I've seen everyone in the book!! and I had to see this especially because I live in Tennessee( it's based on a story in TN) and I saw it and it was ok The man was gross and it was confusing at first but then I was like whatever! it's ok I wouldn't give it 5 stars though!Pris!
4,An Intense Drama,This film was very intense. You never knew from one minute to the next what was going to 'jump' out at you. This was a real 'nail biter'.
4,Great Suspense,"This movie is one of my favorites for the element of ""Make you jump"" suspense. I did alright with it, however, my wife didn't. She screamed,I jumped and wet myself (Ok, maybe an exaggeration on the jumping part)not only because of the movie, but the high decibel pitch accompanying it. We enjoyed this movie all the way till the end. The greatness of this movie depends on your level of ""Horror"". Great imagery, and the story makes you guess what the turn in the plot will be. I recommend it."
2,A daughter's revenge,"This movie is not a horror movie revolving around a witch really. It revolves around the story of a daughter wanting and getting revenge on a person who has violated her. When I watched it, I kept waiting to see a scary witch, but all you ever get is a strange little girl with a bonnet on her head, wolves, & invisible spirit attacks! Also, when you find out who's doing all of the ghost attacks, you're left scratching your head. I thought this movie was going to be scary, but boy was I wrong! 1 1/5 out of 5."
1,Ridiculous.,The twist at the end was completely inaccurate. It ruined the entire movie. I want these hours of my life back. I feel robbed.
2,"Read the book, skip the movie","I made the common mistake of reading the book this movie is based on first. The movie at points is almost laughable...especially a scene where the demon/spirit is slapping the girl. Anyhow, I advise you to skip the movie and read the book instead. Your imagination will creep out our more than the cheesy acting! If you are into demon posession type movies I recommend the Excorcism of Emily Rose instead...better acting, more twists and turns and plenty of ""meat"" to debate theologically and otherwise."
2,It wasn't that great,This movie was awful. And it wasn't evan scary. It was stupid. I don't recommend it but if you really want to see this movie then rent it before you buy it.
1,I hate this movie so much....it sucks,I hate that stupid girl who played the main daughter being raped or whatever by the ghost or her dad or something. The actress that played her totally sucks and all she did was scream mama mama!!!! I was hoping she would be killed by the end of the movie. Wasted acting by Sissy and Donald.........those two actors deserve better scripts.....There is no bell witch just a nasty old daddy....
2,"Could have been a much better ""Haunting""","Blech!!!Let's not mince words here. What could have been a really strong and truly frightening film, because it was based on historical truth, was not to be realized. How many times can one watch the exact same things going on in a film until you turn it off? I don't know, because I was foolish enough to watch to the most ridiculous end!Two stars- because the cinematography saved this film from the bottom. No recommendation in the least."
4,GOOD OLD FASHIONED HAUNTED HOUSE FLICK,I think people that complain about this movie arent used to good old fashioned creepy haunted house movies. no the movie isnt perfect but its very creepy and visually nice to look at. i dont know much about the story but this is a good movie to turn all the lights out and watch. i stopped it a couple of times thinking i heard noises in the house. As far as seeing Sissy Spacek and Donald Sutherland i am glad that these great talents were offered something and i know missing Sissy that i loved seeing her in something new. Its not embarrassing to them at all. I am sure they arent offered as much as they used to be so to get Sissy in something alone is worth the viewing. she was GREAT as always. From someone who has seen every horror movie ever made this was a pleasent throughback to the old fashioned scary movies.
1,Stupid Ending,Sad to see an American Folklore turned into a writers therapy session to deal with childhood trauma's.
2,New Formula not Good,"I wish I would have listened to the other more recent reviews about the new formula. I was able to tolerate the smell of ylang ylang with the old formula, it didn't smell too bad to me. At least it kept the shower clean. After starting with a clean shower of course. But this new formula not only smells bad (like a wet diaper) but it doesn't keep the shower clean. It's funny because everyday, I spray it on the shower, I'm hoping that it will smell better today. I gave it two starts because it does keep the silver chrome? part of the the shower nice and shiny but the rest looks dull and streaky. So disappointing...I have 7 bottles left. I wish I would have listened to the other reviews."
1,"Made my shower door sticky, not clean","I don't really like the smell of this product but I would deal with it as long as the product does a good job. It doesn't. Instead of cleaning the shower room (tiles and the glass door), it made the surface sticky and left dirty spots. This was a waste of money. I'll sticky with my seventh generation products."
2,Shower spray,"My husband bought this product by the case. Big mistake. This product does not do a thing to help keep your shower clean. It does have a pleasant aroma, but I can spritz perfume if I just want fragrance."
2,Disappointing,"As an important figure in the early LA punk scene, Brendan Mullen theoretically would have amounted to an ideal figure to recount its history. Alas, he and co-author Spitz fall short of the mark, though to be fair, this may have owed more to their publisher. What should have been colorful anecdotes are compressed into blips that barely make an impression. The lingering after-effect, on finishing this book, is that it follows too closely in format the superior ""Please Kill Me,"" which largely concerned the NYC punk scene -- and that in turn reflects poorly on the scene in LA, as if that, like this book, followed too closely the scene in NYC. Not true! The LA scene awaits a better recounting. But ""Neutron Bomb,"" although seriously lacking, it still a decent place to begin."
2,Wished it were thicker.,Its not as thick as i would expect. Although it did make sleeping on my hard bed a lot more comfortable. I just wish it was thicker.
5,Great slide!,"My twin girls got this slide when they were one. They learned very quickly how to get up the steps, get their feet in front of them, and slide down!! It is a little narrow, so getting their feet in front of them at that age was a little hard at first because they couldn't balance well. They learned fast and wanted to do it over and over again. This slide doesn't take up a lot of space, plus it folds, so it is great if space is limited. Ours is in the bakyard, and it is easy to clean and very durable. My girls love it, it helps with balance, and it is a classic fun toy! My girls are now almost 3, and they don't slide as much, but they still really love it (especially when the sprinkler makes it wet and they go FAST!)"
4,Great for new chefs,Im a new chef starting out. I got this kit because it looked like it had alot of things in it. When i recived it i did not relize how big it was. I really like it and would highly advise new chefs starting out to get this!!!
5,Amazing!,"I love cooking and experimenting with food and have worked in the food industry but I am not a professional chef. But from the years I've spent in the kitchen serving others, I know the importance of having quality equipement and these knives are the ticket.Be very careful when handling, using and cleaning. They're extremely sharp and keep their edge with proper care.Be prepared also for this set to take up some space in your kitchen. The case that stores the knives is quite large. It's about 2 feet long and 1 1/2 feet in width.I love these knives and it's made my cooking experiences each day a pleasure."
5,Citric Acid from Barry's Farms,"I used Fruit Fresh for years until I realized that Citric Acid would do the trick just as well. It keeps fruit from darkening in fresh fruit salads, pies or puddings. Why buy an expensive little shaker when you can get 4 oz. for about the same price. Love Barry's Farms products, they're always fresh and much less expensive."
5,"Witty, dry adolescent boy's view of adults in his life","A witty, dry adolescent boy's look at the adults in his life. At times laugh out loud funny. I enjoyed the vignette style and the absurd yet believable characters, especially the grandparents. A most entertaining read."
5,Gets the job done,"Seems to be durable enough, fits enough tea for a large mug, easy to clean. I don't need anything more than that."
2,"Cheap, but gets the job done","It is pretty hard to open the cage, the cage is small and the rim bends really easily.The infuser works by squeezing the handle and the lever action opens the cage. The problem is that it is a really tight mechanism. If there was a spring (there is not) it would be too strong.The cage is enough for 2 teaspoons of loose leaf tea, which is usually fine, but if you ever want to serve more than 2.5 coffee mugs of tea you have to do the whole thing more than once.The rim bent the first time I opened it. I didn't even touch the rim. Fortunately, you can bend it back fairly easily.Overall, it does the job it claims to do. The cage has very fine holes which is definitely good. It's not bad, but If I were you I would keep looking."
3,Not good for finely ground teas,"I ordered this mainly to use with the pound of rooibos tea I had bought from Amazon. Unfortunately, the rooibos tea is so finely ground that it goes right through the mesh on this infuser. This infuser would be fine with most teas, but beware for use with finely ground teas like rooibos."
2,Works but not as well as other styles,"This works for tea but not as well as the other style of infuser (the almond shaped ones with the little holes in them). This is a little harder to get closed without stray tea leaves holding it open a little bit. It also leaves more tea particles in the cup than the other style does.It has a tenancy to bend a little bit pretty easily so that you have to bend it back to get the top and bottom circles to meet up with each other.Isn't horrible, but there are better choices out there."
3,Just okay,"I ordered two after searching around and reading the reviews. I've had them for over a month and find that there a bit hard to fill but easy to cleanThe reason for my low rating is the simple fact that as much as I like them, there not the best out there."
3,A Good Book With A Bad Ending,"I thought the majority of the book was very exciting and touching, but at the end the person the main character has been trying to save cannot be saved, so she helps him rest in peace. This book is not even comparable to some of his other works."
1,Leave The Recorded KISS Classics Alone!,I would not take this music if it were given to me for free. End of story. It's already been done by the best rock n roll group on the planet....KISS!
1,Deceptive Packaging,"I already own both films but purchased this as the case described ""Dirty Dozen"" as being a 16x9 transfer. It is not. Further, special features are listed for this film that are not actually on the disc. I knew I was in trouble when the film began with the Turner logo. Old transfer. ""Kelly's Heroes"" IS 16x9 as it was on the single feature release.In addition, it appears the newly repackaged ""How the West Was Won"" suffers from the same deceptive packaging by being labeled ""enhanced for widescreen TVs"" when it is not and is also an old Turner master.People are bound to complain so it's hard to believe Warner Home Video, previously very reliable, would do this intentionally. Something is defintely wrong in their QC department these days."
2,BEWARE OF FALSE ADVERTISING ON PACKAGE,"These are both EXCELLENT movies. However, for some reason (mere incompetence, I'd bet) the dvd's packaging states that The Dirty Dozen is presented in 16x9 (anamorphic) format and also includes audio commentary by cast and crew. This is NOT TRUE--neither of these features exist on the disc. If you're thinking of buying this as an upgrade from your standard single-disc version of Dirty Dozen, don't bother. The DD side of this flipper disc is the same as the budget single-disc, non-anamorphic version that's been available for years.Warner's should either fix the packaging, or upgrade the content of the disc. SO ANNOYING!"
1,Kelly's Heros/The Dirty Dozen,"I like the movies, but the DVD skip on both movies, the soundtrack wason and off at times. I hope the rest is ok.Tom Thomas"
2,Kresley Cole is the only one worth reading,"I paid $11.99 for the Kindle edition of this book and I have to say I feel really ripped off. The first two stories were awful. The first one had a plot so unbelievable it bordered on just plain stupid. And the second was so incredibly misogynistic I wanted to burn the words off my Kindle. I kept waiting for the heroine to say something smart, but she seemed incapable of non-horny thoughts. I almost gave up completely because the first two stories turned my stomach.But the Kresley Cole story made it worthwhile. If I could I would give her story 4 stars and ZERO for the other two."
3,Sort of flat,"There was only one good story in this anthology and that was Kresley Coles story that starts off her immortal series, which I love. But of course that's par of the course for anthologies. There's more duds than actually winners."
2,Disappointed,"I was very dissapointed with all the stories in this book. Plot holes, poor character development and overall just plain under-whelming."
2,not ALL calibers,"NOT *ALL* calibers! DO NOT try to put one of these through a 223 / 556 !!!! It will get stuck and you will not be happy. You can cut them down to size and it will work then, but buyer be ware"
3,They're Ok,"The Otis system is good at what it does; however a one size fits all concept doesn't exactly work out for firearms the way it would seem. The patches however do work really well at what they are supposed to do in terms of cleaning things really well. You can get three uses out of each patch effectively, unlike the six that Otis claims. Unfortunately, I found that there were issues when trying to clean smaller calibers and eventually resorted to going back to my original cleaning kits."
4,cheap for lots!,"for how many patches you get, its a great price. some people complained of strands coming off. i noticed that when handling it roughly at the edges, but have not noticed that when using it to clean my weapons. i use the outer hole for .22LR cleaning. i'm able to flip it over and use it about 1-2 other times, depending upon how dirty the patch looks after the first run. great deal. i plan on purchasing again."
5,A stimulating examination of cross-cultural ferment,"This book is the cultural critic's equivalent of a richly textured and nuanced novel. It is full of startling juxtapositions and imaginative leaps; it can transform the familiar into the strange and wonderful; and its point of view is witty and ironic and generous. It is as valuable to me for its insight into the complex relationship between Lafcadio Hearne and Japanese folklore as it is for its explication of the intricacies of twenty-five years of contemporary Japananese/American post-post-modernism. As I read it, I looked forward with pleasure to re-reading it with deepened understanding."
5,Super lens super service,The lens arrived quicker than expected. I used it same day for macro work on flowers and decorative grasses. Then used it for working an U14 soccer game. Great great great.
5,How can you beat the price for what you get??,"I've been using a Nikon manual focus zoom lens for years, and finally got irritated enough with it to spend the money on a decent zoom lens WITH auto focus, and it's been night and day. I love it. Focuses quick, great picture, great quality, etc. Sure, you can spend more and get a BETTER picture, and QUIETER motor, and BETTER build quality, but if the money's not there, you won't regret this purchase. It's a great lens."
4,Good Into Telephoto Lense for the price,"The is a good intro to photography lense. It's probably the cheapest 70-300 you can find, and it does well enough. It comes with a lense cap, so i don't know why people are buying an extra lense cap. If you are planning on taking sports photography, then you might want to get a different lense, one with image stabilization. But if you are new to the digital photography realm, and you want to increase your arsenal of lenses, and you don't want to break the bank. Go with this one."
5,Stellar Lens,"This is just an awesome lens for the money. Really a bang for your buck type deal, all you have to do is not worry about the loud auto focus. Love It."
3,Good for the money,"Let's not forget that this is a low-cost lens. At the same time, it delivers a nice tele-zoom with macro capability (make sure you read the manual, or you will never get back OUT of macro mode!!!). It ""does what it says on the tin"", even though it is easy to note that the picture can be a little soft, there is quite marked CA, and the autofocus labors somewhat.Construction seems solid enough, and with the included hood I would say that this does give a good value (although I haven't had the chance to compare it with the similar offerings from Sigma and Canon)."
5,Camera Lens,"This lens was delivered very quickly in packaging that protected it very well. I gave it to my son-in-law as a Christmas gift, and he was thrilled with it. A superior product from a very fine businesss. Thank you!"
2,"If you like purple fringe, buy this!",I like the macro portion of this lens. But at 300mm the CA is so pronounced it is unusable at that length. And it is pretty bad at 200mm. I am very disappointed. I would not recommend this lens.
2,The motor is a little noisy and slow - switch to manual focus if you mind,"The motor is a little noisy and slow - switch to manual focus if you mind, picture quality is not so good, than canon 75-300"
4,Great lense!,"This is a fantastic lense for the price. Arrived promptly and in perfect shape. It produces crisp clear images across the entire zoom range and the macro function is wonderful. Mine is mounted on a Pentax K100d Super and it's performance has been excellent over the past year. Auto focus is a bit slow, but the resulting image quality more than makes up for it. I am very happy with this lens!"
3,Chromatic aberration,"When there's enough light for this to work, you get Chromatic aberration, when there' s low light you get nothing(4 seconds to eternity to focus). Canon 55-250mm is or sigma apo 70-300mm will do the trick. I would recommend Canon 55-250IS since its fast autofocus and Image stabilization."
4,I like this lens,With the rotating front lens when you focus the use of a polarizing filter is a 3 step process. I like this lens.
4,Great Lens,"Great lens for the price.Pros:Great pictures up to about 280, the included hood worked great and made the pictures look much better, fits great in my bagCons:Was a little noisy on AF (not disturbing though), the lens is a little tight to turn to extend and you feel like you almost have to force it before it zoom's hopefully this will get better, the AF did not always work correctly at 300 but once it did it took good pictures.For the price you can't beat this lens!"
4,Nice lens on a budget,Bought this lens for my Canon Digital Rebel XTi. Works very well and generally happy with it. It is NOT an IS lens so low light shots or tight zoom photography defininitely requires a tripod. Very good results in bright daylight but if you don't have a rock solid steady hand you might want to consider an IS lens.
5,great deal,i needed a zoom lens for my son's wedding..this one is awesome!!! the pictures are incredible and so isn't the price!
4,Great lens for the price,"I read a lot of criticism on motor noise but have to ask what does that matter if you are not taking video where it might be heard. I know I like the macro and enjoy the added distance for taking photos, I am still getting use to the lens though so will probably update this again later."
3,Good lens but doesnt work well with Pentax K10,"This is a very good lens at a great price. Good optics, sharp images. I've had mine for a year, and as long as I stay within the 70-200m range, it's fantastic. I used it to take photos of a high school football game on a dark, rainy afternoon, with my digital camera set to ISO 800, and the results were great. I could enlarge and crop without problem even shooting under poor lighting conditions.The only problem for me is that between 200-300m it does not work properly with the Pentax K10 auto system. I'm not sure what the technical problem is, but it basically shorts out the auto-exposure system. You have to turn the camera off and back on and remove and re-attach the lens, and then it works fine."
1,Gravel Voice,"I wanted to like this disc based upon the positive reviews that I was reading , but there were only 2 songs that I could finish listening to because of his ""unusual voice"". The arrangements & lyrics are decent , but he makes Tom Waits sound like a real good singer."
5,very interesting movie,"A lot of movies that are classified ahead of their time in dealing with issues like sexuality, race and war are almost always from foreign countries. America was still a ""child"" and steered far away from such issues until the 21st century and only then on the cable networks (Queer as Folk, Weed and Paul Mooney's comic routines). ""Liana"" was definitely ground breaking and thought provoking for the time of it's release. The previous review was right in stating that this is not a movie so much about a lesbian affair but more about an unfulfilled and lonely housewife finding her way in the world."
1,"Should be ""Battle of Buck Rogers Effects""","Actually, Buck Rogers had better effects. I think they used a commodore 64 to make the effects for this movie. Man, how do movies like these even come out? Really. There is so much crap out there, there has to be something behind the scenes we do not know about. Because someone is still making money on these. This goes to show that probably any one of us here could write, direct, and act in a movie."
1,Battle Los Crap!,I just finish watching this Piece of Mierda. I know in some reviews people liked it.I watched it and it was a horrible waste of nice quality film ever.This Ninth class actors just stink. Miss old Woman Ninja want to be simply Sucks. One of the Worst movies ever... Not as bad as GIGLI But it's up their.B-Movie garbage....
1,Beware!,"This is NOT the theatrical movie, ""Battle: Los Angeles,"" starring Aaron Eckhart and Michelle Rodriguez. Instead, it's a horrible, cheap production from SyFy... 90 minutes of pure discomfort!"
1,Crapola,I am attempting to watch this movie on SyFy right now. It is extremely terrible. Please do not waste your hard earned money on this piece of trash. The acting is terrible as well as the special effects and the story. I was only able to watch 15 minutes of this. Too bad I can't go back in time to get those minutes back.
3,Conception-flow,"Great melodic metal. If you like bands like Kamelot, Royal Hunt, Stratovarious, you will like this band."
5,Great Toy,My daughter loves her new piano. I am glad I purchased the Melissa and Doug piano over other brands.It's well made and was assembled in minutes.
3,Grand is Okay,"Like the look of the piano but the legs wobble even though they are tightly screwed in. The two pieces that go on the top to hold the music book constantly fall out or are removed from my daughter, wish they would attach better."
4,Teac 5 Disc CD Changer,"Everything about this CD change met or exceeded my wants and desires except that the remote does not have a ""Power"" button. I still have to physically be close to the changer to turn it on or off, a slight problem if you are trying to hide or place it in a remote location. A small problem that none the less detracts from my complete satisfaction."
2,They don't make them like they used to,"I had a Kenwood 5 cd player for 10 years that finally died. I ordered the TEAC as it is one of the few that still had a 5 cd carousel format and was a reasonable price. This unit didn't work well from the getgo. It took forever for the carousel to turn. After 2 weeks it wouldn't play the cd I selected and would constantly default to cd#1. I then had a problem getting it to play after I had turned it on. The only thing it did well was to open and close. Once I got it to play it sounded fine, but it was just a series of frustrations getting this unit to work. I have just returned it for a refund as I couldn't get a replacement on this item. The other options for a 5 CD carousel were either to expensive (JVC)or I read the terrible reviews on Sony so forget that one. I have reordered this unit and hope that the next one I get is better than this one turned out."
1,Lousy CD Changer,"I just recieved this TEAC changer today, Christmas Eve. I hooked it into my system and it played for 2 minutes then started to skip the CD. I cleaned the CD and put it back in a minute later and this changer would not read the CD. I put in several more CD's and it continued not to read them. This is in just 5 minutes out of the box. MADE IN CHINA should have been the warning."
5,TEAC PD-D2610 5 - CD Carousel Changer,"What's wrong with this picture? I walk into a store where 3 salespeople are standing around talking - and don't stop talking to wait on me....What to do?.....Go home, go onto Amazon.com (my favorite place to shop), and order a TEAC 5 cd changer at 12 noon; it's delivered the very next day, at 11 a.m. I thought the set up would be complicated, but I simply pulled out the old 5 cd changer, and installed the TEAC in about 5 mins. It works perfectly, easy directions, easy to install, and sounds great (well, I have it hooked up to my home theater setup). The most difficult part was getting the electric cord thru the back of the entertainment center. This is a great unit and Amazon makes it easy to obtain, at a reasonable price. It plays CD-RW cds, and MP3 files recorded on CD-R. No more skipping all the homemade cds in the changer. Continuous music has been restored for the holidays. I recommend this unit."
4,teac pd-d2610 5-cd carousel changer with mp3 cd playback,"this is my first cd changer from teac , I should have bought it a long time ago, amaising sound quality , a smooth operation in the changer, in switching of the carousel . I am very happy and pleased of my purchase of this TEAC unit, thank you very much.Domenic Marzullo"
5,"CD PLAYER, good buy","These items seem to wear out rather quickly, in years... I've had three or four. This one works fine; good price, fast delivery. I've no idea how long it will last... I always hope for the best."
4,Exceptional value,"After considerable shopping to replace my malfunctioning 14 year old disc player it was a pleasant surprize to see the offerings from Amazon. The TEAC 5 disc player suits my needs very nicely with a very fair price - easy installation, and easy to use. Many of our local electonic stores don't even carry these units anymore and those that do have a poor selection that were much more expensive. The young folks like the more advanced high-tech units but as a senior with several hundred discs it's a pleasue to load up my new player and listen to hours of entertainment. A very gratifying, cost efficient purchase.MLS, West Palm Beach"
1,An expensive lesson,"Bought this unit, hooked it up and enjoyed it one time. A month or so later I went to use it again and it skipped on any CD I had in the drawer. Just past the return time period from Amazon I had to take up my beef with Teac. Sent them an e-mail. To their credit they called me the same day, telling me that if I shipped it cross country to CA, that they would repair it and send it back. I had discarded the packaging materials, so I took the unit to the UPS store, and was informed it would cost me $42.00 to box and ship this to CA. Not worth it for something with a retail cost of $120. I sent Teac another e-mail informing them of the cost to ship this. No effort on their part to take ownership of the cost to make this right.BTW for those of you who like the multi-disk random shuffle - I discovered that this unit will not perform that function. It will only shuffle on one disk at a time."
3,A mistake..,"I thought it would be my introduction to House music, but I was very disappointed.. Only disc 3 has some songs that I like. 1 and 2 are boring..."
2,Dont waste your money...,"After coming home from the winter music conference in miami last week and hearing all sorts of funky house I was pumped to add some new cd's to my collection. The one mistake i made while doing this was buying this cd. It is very slow and boring. I need something that is gonna catch me and want to make me move. If i was waiting in an elevator in the 1970's this cd is perfect. I know dimitri is a good dj and defected is a great label but this time it wasnt happening. There are a few songs hear and there that are up to par but as far as a 3 disc set its just not good. If you want to throw a dinner party this cd is good if you really like good house check out something else i would go with erick morrillo, hector romereo, junior jack and kid cream, roger sanchez, miguel migs, frankie knuckles. They all get it done!! Hope this helps , later ......."
5,"Fun, exciting and highly effective!","Leslie takes her basic WalkAerobics just a little further to provide an excellent work-out for the whole body. She uses the same basic steps as her earlier video, then adds more upper body movements and a little twist to the sidesteps. I hate to exercise alone and this video makes you feel like you're a part of her class and in the studio even when you're in your own living room."
4,"Good product, but difficult installation","This is a difficult product to install, but that doesn't make it a bad product. You just need to know what you are getting into. The enclosed instructions were fairly complete. The instruction do contain a web address where you can watch an 8 minute video of the installation process that goes into much more detail. Do yourself a favor and watch the video at least once. You will get a lot of good tips (such as spraying your finger tips with the included solution to prevent the parts from sticking to your hand) and feel a lot more confident when you do the installation.I had to ding the product one star because the spray bottle broke early in the installation. By the way, you can buy an additional bottle of solution from the company for a small fee. Having more of the solution will yield better results than not having enough."
3,Breaks again in just 4 years!,The first one that came with the processor broke in about 3 years. The stem disintegrated while I was shredding cheese! I mainly use the stem to attach the shredding disc. The manufacturer replaced the part as it was still under some kind of warranty. The part works the last 4 years. then it broke in half with springs bouncing in the processor while I was shredding cheese! The funny thing is that the processor motor is still going strong and so does the blade and the other parts. It is just this plastic part. (the first one has an uneven discoloration) I would hope that cuisinart has a better quality on this stem! I hate to be paying for this stem every 4-5 years!
4,If you did not believe in the death penalty.................,This book is of course about the unbelievable horror Paul Bernardo and his wife Karla committed on countless young girls. If you are shocked by what was written in the newspapers at the time do not read this book - it contains some of the most disgusting acts that people can do to others in the name of ... pleasure. If ever there was a case for the death penalty this is one.The book mostly focuses on Karla and the way in which she fooled and manipulated the police. It is very readable but is utterly shocking.
4,Disturbing and graphically detailed.,"These two people, Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka, are the mostsickest of human creatures around. Their story is compelling, shockingand absolutely disgusting. Stephen Williams is a fine writer. He does not let you forget about what they did to those poor young girls, which is absolutely horrifying and unbelievable. My heart goes out to the victims and their families, both in death and in life. I hope Paul and Karla burn in Hell for what they've done.With all Sincerity, A stunned reader from Merrimack, NH"
2,Too little,"I found the contents amusing, although it could have included quotes from actors/actresses, movie moguls, etc., and to omit Dorothy Parker was a tragedy. I thought it could have gleaned more than what it did."
1,Talking in circles for 400 pages,"I have a high IQ, I 've read countless books on TA, including the very dry Pring-TA Explained, and I couldn't find anything lucid about this book.The chart examples were overcrowded with short, medium, and long term trendlines, support and resistance and Fib charts.I kept looking for a chapter that was straightforward but couldn't find one.Stick to his web site--this book is a big disappointment."
1,"Emperor's ""Important"" New Clothes?","I rate this book at minus 5 as well.It does not matter what you call it, the self-named ""master"" is still naked, with no clothes on.The author is apparently incompetent in math, probably a reflection of developmental arithmetic disorder. The obvious inability in forming any clear high-school level concepts indicates tremendous and unsumountable learning disabilities. These disabilities should be remedied by seeking helps from the professionals, and should not be ""blamed"" on the market ""volatility"", ""dynamics"", or ""conspiracies""."
1,"Lots of educated talk, but it just doesn't contain anything useful","One big dissappointment.Let me repeat again what others have already mentioned here in the comments: you won't get anything useful out of this book. The author gives you the impression he's got a whole new toolkit of swing trading techniques to show you, but you won't get anything. There are some set-ups mentioned in this book, but they're not even supported by backtests or other evidence.For this price, and 400 pages with tons of graphs, I expected a lot more. The writing style of this author can be called frustrating at least.There are much better books out there on chart patterns or swing trading (Elder, Weinstein, Appel, Link, ...).I'm sorry if this review sounds too negative, but these are my exact feelings after reading it."
1,Wrong Title,"After reading this book, I thought that the author is extremely dishonest, and that the book should be named as""Swing Rambling On Specially Selected Stock Charts By A Random Mind"".If there is anything that could be called ""new"" in this ""book"", it is the dishonesty of the writer who made such ""tardemark-claim"" on the so-called ""seven bells"". Yet there is nothing, not a single ""bell"" is defined in any way, even not defined loosely. That's only useful for the writer: since nobody could test it, or claim whether or not they actually work. Sound familiar? Uh!!! It reminded me the infamous fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen.I would like to give the writer a second chance: If he could define a single thing out of the ""7 bells"" on this board, I will be more glad to tell him what is wrong with his ""work."""
4,How to trade in the net connectivity era,"Ok, now that every novice traders knows what a flag pattern is, it seems like every market maker is fading it and every novice is losing. Well, if you are on the losing end of that proposition, what to do? Alan Farley has a good set of strategies that can help you overcome this negative net worth situation. Along with Dave Landry's Swing Trading book, I would say that this is a must buy opportunity for the trader who wants to be successful."
3,good info but TOUGH read,"I read the reviews where people had to read this book several times to get the info, and now that I own it I see what they mean. The author writes in a very complex manner. He uses insider terminology & phraseology without fully defining it, or defines it later in the text, much after he has used the word in the ordinary flow of a chapter. He often uses terms interchangeably, without explaining that they are near-synonyms. The reader must flip to the index to understand the meaning of a sentence (inadequate glossary). Structurally, as well, the author hops all around. The layout for the book does not build consecutively.The book presents some excellent market ideas, however I found myself lost in the writing style, reading and rereading till hypnotized. I have since discovered other books that explain the same ideas in a manner that is much clearer and more accessible."
2,Stay Away,"You will not learn anything from this book, well except for fear and greed that apeares every other page. that will not teach you anything along there is no trading strategy, all about swing trader should do that, shouldn't do this...., Written like you are writing a paper on something you know nothing about, proven by continuous refernce to other books and what they written.Bits and pieces from here and there, good Candles, but no trading strategy or will teach you how. The seven bells, who use them. Try Conners or Copper books for short term trading."
1,Bad Style or Bad Character?,"I also rate this book at no stars at all.For those who felt that all the problems in this ""book"" is just because of the author's style or ego, I would like to make the following suggestion. Just try to follow one so-called ""concept"" appeared in this book, and you would soon find out that NOTHING in this book, or NOTHING from this author's mouth, has a meaning that common sense understood. Actually, you have to FORGET everything you've learned in your life-time about learning process, thought process, logic, concept, just in order to follow this self-proclaimed ""master.""I agree with one of the reviewers, and I am also willing to refute any specific claim, either by author himself, or any of hired pumpers. More specifically, I would like to challenge the author, or any his hypters to explain just one ""concept"" from his ""seven-bells""."
1,Talks more and more about less and less until everything is said about nothing,"Out of perhaps 300 books on trading, this one takes the cake. This gentleman really knows his stuff but it it comes across as far too obtuse for me. I felt like it was in your face, full on at one hundred miles per hour. And you know what? At the end of it its like wow what was that, what just happened ? Hurricane Katrina ?I'm sorry but rather than see some systematic application of quantitative techniques, all I felt I got was an in your face, throw the book of trading indicators at a price movement and then see what sticks. I found the methods presented (for me at least) to be all over the place.I don't normally comment - but I felt I needed to air a total disappointment with this book.Save your money. Move on."
1,"Wise insight, bad readability","I bought this book a year ago, and tried many times to read though it, but gave up. This guy has good knowledge, but wrote in a way he talks to himself that can hardly absorbed by others."
1,Do you need to buy this book?,"There are useful ideas in this book but I find it is so difficult to read. We definitely need to apply the right strategy to suit the market cycle but do we need to have too many entry set-ups? Trading is a game of probability. There is no guarantee an entry set-up will work out. Risk control and exit strategy are more important. We can swing trade successfully with just a few entry set-ups.Do you need to buy this book? If you want to get ideas on entry set-ups and chart analysis you may consider but be prepared it is not an easy read. Besides, most of the ideas are already presented in the author's website [...] You may want to visit his website first."
5,The BEST brazilian group!,"Hey guys! 5 stars is not enough to describe this CD. Jota Quest is the best pop/rock group in Brazil. Girls....u gotta see the guy who plays the guitar (his name is Marco Túlio), he's a total babe! The songs are great, great melody, lyrics, everything's great, ya know what i mean? U gotta listen to it! What are u waiting for...huh? Go check it for ur self! More information go to www.jotaquest.com.br See ya guys later!"
2,not very useful as it is,"Many of the dialogs assumes that you know the subject and several of the screen take forever to come up. I am surprised that some of the business schools recommends this kit as pre-MBA training material! Btw, they don't even accept returns (depending on where you buy). I strongly recommend to look for any other options."
1,Not happy,This umbrella was so poorly made - it broke the very first day I used it!! NOT A GOOD PURCHASE!!
1,Rhonda,I was very disapointed in this cd. It did not sound like the real singer at all. Would you like to buy it back?
1,LO MEJOR DEL SR. SÁNCHEZ....,"...es que él mismo se ha creído sus ideas, y ahora se siente redentor y salvador del mundo. No dice NADA nuevo (no me extrañaría que el título, sólo el título de mi revisión, apareciera en la solapa de uno de sus libros....)"
3,A good beginning...part2,"When Seth entered the magical world with the all knowing talking tree, I became a little interested. All the party characters, except Rane and his magical flute, should have used their gifts more since they were brought there for that purpose. I guess only so much could fit in a little book. For those who have read it, I bet at least half the readers felt as disappointed as I am at the final battle. What kind of ending was that? A little to simple, not clever, for me."
1,Not a great purchase...,"When it came out of the box, it was working fine but when I held it up to the first light, it broke... Just completely stopped working. Maybe I did something wrong but I've bought two of these light testers and each one has broken before getting the chance to use it."
5,Fantastic Sinister Pop Album,"What Luke Haines and the Auteurs acomplished here was an erudite, melodic, largely acoustic set of songs that perfectly capsulated the early brit pop scene in a way to which only the Auteurs could. This album is fairly perfect and is a wonderful treasure of simple, yet wonderful songs."
5,A Southern Gospel Classic,"This recording features a wonderful gospel group with wonderful vocals. This was the recording when two populars songs first came out in 1981 ""Beulah Land"" and ""We Shall Wear A Robe And Crown"". If you are a Southern Gospel Music fan, then you need this classic recording from a talented mixed group recorded in 1981."
3,Nice Idea - Average Quality,"I think the idea behind ""NAMING A STAR"" is a very interesting concept to gift recipients. However, I was somewhat disappointed in the actual product (stuffed animal). The animal was rather ""flimsy"" and seem to have loose fur. I would not recommend allowing a small child to ""play"" with the stuffed animal."
4,Bear,"Grandson still has this, he is now 5 and it still works well. I would buy this again for another child."
1,Broken neck,Arrived with broken neck. Split just below tuners. Hanging by the strings. I contaced the company. I still have not recieved my replacement and it has been over 30 days.
3,"TOO ambient for an ""ambient"" CD","This was the first Euphoria CD that I bought, hoping to be taken into the realm of peace and serenity. Rather than the mellow, yet soothing beats and rhythms I was hoping for, this CD mostly contains a lot of ""oooooohs"" and ""ahhhhhhhhs"". It kind of reminds me of the music you hear when you walk into the ""nature store""...like water trickling into a pool....somewhat calming but a little TOO obvious and ambient. I'm gonna try my luck with the regular ""chilled"" album instead. Wish me luck!"
2,grade c+,I am glad I only payed 14.00 Dollars and not over than that for this CD. (I guess that tells it all)
5,"He who smelt it, dealt it","Anyone who actually reads Steigmann-Gall's review, which apparently Colorado Chris has not done, will read a lengthy four page examination of every part of Goodrick-Clarke's book. Apparently Locke will stoop to false accusations to support his otherwise untenable assertions. Steigmann-Gall has done a very thorough job. Chrissie, you can like the book without defaming a reviewer who doesn't. By the way, you should read Steigmann-Gall's book to see just how ""jealous"" of Goodrick-Clark he is. Either that, or pass judgment on a subject you actually know something about -- like UFOs."
3,I wish I could change it to give it more stars!,"This one doesn't flow as well as some of the other Sesame Street ones--this was my original comment, but as we watch it more and more, my daughter loves this video. I want to give it more stars now that I am editing my review, but Amazon won't let me change that part. This is a very cute video, and just took us more time than the others to get into. My daughter loves the Honker Duckie Dinger Jamboree and Put Down the Duckie (with tons of celebrities like John Candy, Paul Simon, Danny DeVito, and Rhea Perlman to name a few). A very good movie that all ages can enjoy (and MY mom's favorite because of the James Taylor song, too). Buy this video!"
5,Best of the Sesame Street DVDs,"I've purchased about 5-6 Sesame Street DVDs and will probably purchase more. But this is the best of the bunch. It's not too long. All the songs are pretty catchy with some old time favorites like the Ladybugs' Picnic. I find myself singing them. Best of all, my son first saw this when he was abou 10 months old and it was the only DVD that caught his interest. He's 16 months now and still enjoys this one (along with Thomas but that's an entirely different thing in a little boys life...) If you children like music, this one is a sure fire hit."
2,Too short,"I purchased this video and although it is cute, it is much to short. I think that it is only 15 or 20 minutes in length and only has a limited number of songs. My grandson liked it. I was disappointed that it didn't last very long. I guess I should have read the time on the review before I purchased it."
4,Fine Product,Easy to use and does a neat job. Especially appreciated is the ability to create 40+ hour DVDs containing iTunes music tracks. The only drawback is that the program will not allow songs purchased and downloaded from the iTunes music store to be recorded on DVDs. This can be a significant drawback for some users.
5,review,"I bought this as a gift for my dad. I guess he liked it so I'll give it a good review.Honestly, I only bought it because he was afraid to download it from the internet for free. He never listens when I have an idea...."
1,Audio & Video Sync Problem...,"The Tivo Transfer feature would be great if it worked properly. Unfortunately, each show I transfer to my Mac has audio and video that is out of sync and the transfers are unwatchable. To make matters worse, Roxio support is non-existent. Check the Roxio forums for more info. Buyer Beware!"
1,Sucks,"Toast Titanium 10, which I payed over a 100$ bill for wastes more DVD tapes than I can afford. When I give it a simple task, suchas convert a VLC clone into a DVD in seldom succeeds. The last tape it failed to get the audio. I always wind up using Parallels andusing DvdFlick which never fails to get the TS folders."
1,Masterful Piece of Propaganda!,"Although Richard North Patterson is a masterful story teller and has written several excellent novels in the past, his most recent works are nothing more than masterful examples of left wing propaganda. I am neither a gun owner nor a gun advocate, but I found this book to be extremely one-sided in its handling of this controversial issue. I don't know what has happened to this talented author, but this is the second book in a row in which he has twisted the facts to suit his own agenda. Don't waste your time on this unbalanced story. Read one of Mr. Patterson's earlier works instead. He has definitely lost one formerly dedicated fan!"
4,A Well Written Argument,"Mr. Patterson has evolved from a writer of thrillers to a writer of political intrigue. This well crafted novel is the third in the Kilcannon trilogy. The argument centers on gun control and the NRA. The debate is a good one and it is well thought out (ignore other reviewers knee jerk response to any form of gun control). The characters are well drawn. The political machinations are reminiscent of Drury's ""Advise and Consent""."
1,A political passion play.,"The characters are one dimensional. Pure evil vs. pure good. No real effort is made by the author to give the characters believable motivation. Like a passion play, the target audience seems to be people who already agree with the authors motivation, since those who disagree or who have an open mind will not likely be engaged by the flat characterizations, one sided dialogues, and obvious logical flaws in the plot. This is a vanity project of the author. It was not written to entertain, but to push a message. Fine if you are writing a speech, not so fine if you are selling your work to public that believes it is buying an entertaining book. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that was looking for an entertaining read."
2,Not Exactly a Novel,"I have never before read a novel by a popular author that was so totally dependent on the reader's commitment to the same political and social agenda as its' author. I have enjoyed earlier works by Patterson, but had read not the 2 prior books of this apparent trilogy; if I had, I would probably have skipped this one. It would have been more honest to present it as a clearly political tome, to warn away those who prefer not to be bludgeoned on every page by an author's attempt to ""educate"" the reader as to the ""correct"" political and social views. This made the book somewhat tedious, and far from a truly original and entertaining read. No doubt this is my own fault, in that I rarely read book blurbs. Had I been aware of its' 2 big fans, I would not have purchased it. For those who do not share the agenda of Senator Ted Kennedy, or the Clintons, I would advise that you not waste time or money on this offering."
2,Snore...,"I agree with the message Patterson was trying to deliver (I am much in favor of stricter gun control), but this book was so long, drawn out, depressing, and dry - I started to wish I'd never heard of guns or gun control. It was painful trying to force myself to finish this book. I felt like I was watching one of those poorly-done TV documentaries - when you might as well be listening to your most pathetically dull high school teacher. On the other hand, my mom thought it was a fabulous book."
3,I am off to the gun store,"This is the first book I have read by Patterson. He is an excellent writer and it is too bad that he took such shameless liberties to push his agenda. I do not own a gun and am sympathetic to his cause, but RNP beats his message into your head with a sledge hammer. After reading this book I can see why people want to own guns--to protect themselves from the arrogance and self rightouesness of the intolerant left. This book is so slanted he even paints the Boy Scouts as a right wing political group. The arrogance really comes out in his afterword.All that said he does tell a good story, hence the three stars.-"
2,"""Balance of Power"" is not balanced","According to Patterson, 20% of US citizens like guns, 20% dislike guns, and 60% are somewhere in the middle, providing the ""balance of power"". The 20% that like guns will dislike this book, and the 20% that dislike guns will like this book. The other 60% are likely to move a bit closer to disliking guns by reading this book. But the reader should be mindful of the fact that Patterson is controlling both sides of the gun debate inside the covers of his book. Clearly, he is anti-gun and believes that the Second Second protects only the rights of state militias, not individuals. If you're looking for a well written, emotionally compelling, fictional story to buttress your belief that guns are bad, this book is for you. On the other hand, if you'd like to explore a balanced debate, check out ""Opposing Viewpoints Series - Gun Control (Opposing Viewpoints Series)"" by Helen Cothran (Editor)."
1,Conservative?---Save your money!,I usually don't like to write reviews on books I haven't finished but this one deserves all the bad press it can get. This book is so politically one-sided that I couldn't even bring myself to finish it. I got so bogged down in Patterson's political agenda (of which I don't agree with) that I lost total interest in the story.One only has to look at who wrote the blurbs on the cover to realize that the book has a left-leaning agenda. Gun control is one thing but Republican bashing is another and there is enough of that in the first half of the book that any self respecting conservative would have to stop reading as I did.I have been a big fan of Patterson's for many years and was sorely disappointed that he chose to politicize his novel. I probably won't bother reading any of his future novels after this one.
5,A must for Medicine,"If you are interested in Pulmonary or are interested in bettering youself, this is a must have for your collection. It is an easy read that you can read through multiple times and pick up new stuff each time. Highly recommended"
3,Not what I expected,"A few years ago, I came across a CD titled ""Love Songs of WWII"" and I loved it. This isn't the same. It is OK but I was disappointed"
3,All or nothing,"I bought this for our office as a way to give our folks the ability to cook various things for lunch. It has met that goal, and it has been great to have around. I was worried that it wouldn't produce the kind of heat that a regular stove would, but it does just fine!My one complaint and it is a significant one, is that it doesn't really have a medium heat setting. The dial covers the range but the heat it actually produces is either very, very hot, or hardly anything at all. I don't know if that is a quirk of just my unit or if that's a typical problem people face. That is a big enough flaw, to me, however, that if I bought another one, I would try a different brand."
2,Works but cannot simmer.,"i bought this burner two years ago and it has been working just fine. however, i must say that i am now in the market for a new one because i have gotten tired of my only two option high or low. one can't really cook on this thing - which i need to since it's my only stove - because there is no medium range of heat. other than that it's fine."
4,Good medical information,I liked this book very much and will keep it as part of my Ayuervedic library. It has very detailed and useful medical information. I was a little disappointed with the lack of spiritual information and spiritual tie-in to our physical parts. But over all a very good reference book.
4,A good book,"I bought this book while we were traveling. I thought that it would pass the time, and it did. The books atmosphere is great. There is great dialogue which seems like you really are in North Carolina. It is a good mystery that leaves a lot of people dead and has a very twisted ending. I couldn't figure it out, but I am not a detective either. The book runs smoothly and makes you want to read it through out the day. I hope it comes back in print because my copy is ageing."
3,The Time It Never Rained,"I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THE BOOK, IT FOR ME WENT INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL ABOUT RANCH LIFE INSTEAD OF THE POINT IN WHICH THE BOOK WAS TO BE ABOUT UNTIL HALF WAY THRU. IT GOT MORE INTERESTING THEN & THE CHARACTERS BECAME MORE REAL. I JUST EXPECTED MORE OF THE YRS. THAT IT NEVER RAINED & THE HARD TIMES. SORRY."
2,Not that good,"I would have liked it if the product had an push button that chopped without me holding it down however, I can cut up small amounts to do what I need to do and for the cost it should have been just a little cheaper."
4,Slip leash,This slip leash works great for small dogs - I need a more heavy duty diameter one for my larger breeds
1,THIS IS NOT A TOY,"So there we go. On Amazon it is listed as a toy - this review treats it as a toy. Only when you get it and have been staring at what seems to be a broken toy for weeks or even months (live overseas, return much too complicated) you suddenly see in small print on the packaging that this is a collector's item and not for children. Ok. Grown up toy then. I finally read enough reviews to find out HOW to make it work - only after I'd opened it up and examined it with a non-engineer's eye. Whole ordeal just very bloody annoying. My son WILL actually be entertained by it and plays gently enough to enjoy it - but the process was too long and more information was needed up front."
4,Fun little guy!,"I bought this as a gift for an adult family member. She loves robots, and robot related things. This guy made her quite happy. He's fairly easy to operate and we've had no problems or system failures. When I ordered him, I thought the sparks came out of his mouth, sadly that is not the case. He does have sparks, but they're in his chest behind the plastic...safety first I guess. :-/This little guy may not be appropriate for a young child, but he's very cool. Plus he scares the dog, which is a bonus."
5,An intensive exploration of satellite image-based weather analysis.,"There are not a lot of textbooks that cover satellite-image based weather identification and forecasting, and luckily, Conway's book is still available. He starts out covering ca. 1990s satellite image technology and moves on to sat-based geography before diving deeply into sat image interpretation for weather forecasters and enthusiasts. Conway's approach is outstanding, simultaneously providing the reader with the weather theory that is manifest in the sat images. I run a NOAA APT satellite downlink system at home (receiving signals from the NOAA polar orbiters on 137MHz and processing the telemetry w/software) so I put what I learn from Conway to work every day. Overall, it's a fascinating, well written book. I hope that this book gets an update someday, so as to take advantage of the advances in weather satellite imagery in the last 15 years since it was printed."
3,good textbook,I am just getting started in the class where I am using this book and so far it is quite informative
2,Not his best,"If you read one book by Rohington Mistry or even one book about India or just one book in your life read ""A Fine Balance"" from the same author.This book just leaves an empty feeling when you finish it and is just not a well though out or even coherent work. Read his other (and far better) work and move on......."
5,Fans of R.K.Narayan have one more author to look forward to,"This is storytelling at its best. Gentle humour, and empathy with all characters. Mistry develops his characters and surroundings in great details. I can visualize the 'Khodadad Building' in front of my eyes.I read this book after reading 'A Fine Balance' and was kind of dreading the end because I was expecting it would all end horribly. (Ofcourse, that does not take anything away from that book - a very moving tale). So it was an added bonus when the end was a softer landing."
1,Loved the Style!However.....,"However,the're was a stripped screw so that the dice on top would fall off every secound!I tried everything to fix it but couldn't.I'm going to try another bio plastic belly button ring and see what happens.Hopefully I won't get a stripped screw!Oh this belly button ring is super super small size of my pinky finger but I liked that part!"
4,"Love product, but don't buy it from Amazon","First, I want to say that I love the pattern. I ended up buying the whole dining set for 12 from [...]. It is unique, so it will stand out from more classic/plain dinnerware, such as the person who commented about buying it for a Thanksgiving potluck. The color is more of a deep burgundy than the red it shows in the picture. I give the product itself 5 stars.BUT- Amazon.com is very bad at shipping this item. The first order came shattered, and wasn't packaged properly, with stuffing only on top of the box; nothing to protect it on any other side. I ordered a replacement and it came the exact same way. So I sent a e-mail to customer service and the person told me that another order would probably come broken too, so I shouldn't waste my time with placing another order with Amazon. So, I went to [...] and placed my order - got free shipping, so the pricing was the same. It was packaged great and not one piece was broken. Amazon shipping gets 0 stars."
2,"Too dang small, and messy","I bought this because my local department store didn't have the Brew 'n' Go coffeemaker with the travel mug - big mistake! None of my mugs will fit into this thing! Also, the coffee grounds wash out of the filter and into the reservoir, which is annoying. Finally, the first cup I made was very messy - I got water everywhere. I'm a bit of a klutz, but I've never had that much trouble with a coffeemaker in the past. No one around here seems to have the Brew 'n' Go in stock, so I guess I'm gonna go with the Toastess. I can't wait on Amazon to ship it - I need coffee now!"
2,Junk,"I bought the Cup-At-A-Time as a water-heater for my dorm room, and for a while it did it's job merrily, but several months after I bought it, it began to sputter out on me. Once, while loading the water after brewing a cup of tea fifteen minutes prior, steam shot out of the fixture and a piece flew out. It appeared to be a regulating apparatus that stops and starts the intake of water. I managed to put it back in, but time and time again, it dislodges. Another problem I noticed is the lid does not sit securely on the machine, and can be easily opened by a small child that may not know any better. I plan on returning this fixture to the store I bought it from for something different."
3,Buy from your local stores,I don't why I bought it. In Wal-mart you will find cheaper and better products.
3,Beware - way too short,We are fans of the Black & Decker model and wanted a white one for our beach house however this one only accomodates short mugs.
3,"Useful, but with Problems","I have had two of these coffeemakers and have been generally satisfied. However, I have encountered two problems. First, in the water reservoir there is a little plastic piece that is attached over the hole to force the water to drip over the grounds. In my experience this piece wears out after about a year, and the coffeemaker then becomes inoperative. Second, the coffeemaker uses #1 cone filters, which are comparatively difficult to find. Almost all grocery chains seem to carry only the #2 size and above. However, the #1 size is available on Amazon at $15-20 for 12 packs of 40."
4,Great little gadget!,"I'm not a coffee drinker, but I like a hot beverage in the morning.Since I commute, This little one cup beverage maker is a life saver. I fill it with water and tea leaves the night before, and just hit the power button in the morning. It's easy to clean and takes up very little space on the counter.My only peeve is that sometimes it drips and gets under the basket inside the machine, and can spill out unexpectedly when moved."
1,Product does not work,"This one cup coffemaker from Black & Decker did not work properly thefirst time, I used it. Instead of waiting until you pushed the button down to turn it on, it just started brewing on its own. So I had to pour in the water, put in the coffee and make sure I had the mug underneath the opening before I plugged it in or the water would come pouring out of it. My mother bought one of these brewers too, and it did the exact same thing mine did. I have had other brands of these one cuppers over the years, and none of them did what this one did. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,DON'T ORDER THIS PRODUCT,This product arrived without the cup and the polarized plug had been cut off. Doesn't do me much good. What kind of company ships broken and missing products?
2,More trouble than it was worth,"I love coffee. But I am the only coffee drinker at home. Sounds like a perfect situation for a cup-at-a-time coffee maker, right? I thought so too, so I ordered this little guy from Amazon. I tried to use the mesh filter that came with the coffee maker, but grounds kept ending up in my coffee. Then I added paper cones, which worked ok. I couldnt find cones small enough so I had to wedge a much larger cone in the smaller space. It worked, but was frustrating.However, the coffee maker will only fit the standard coffee mug. My coffee mugs arent that much taller, but they wont work with this guy. I had to give him the boot after an earnest month of trying to adapt."
4,Good for a quick cup,Me being an avid coffee drinker I will have to say if you want a quick cup it does the job. For the money its cheap and provides a quick cup but you better have good coffee I used the pods and found it to be weak at time and sometimes you need a stronger cup I think more brewing is better. Sometimes was a bit messy water all over the place but maybe Im a bull in a china shop would recommend the item I spent more on starbucks in a week.
2,JUNK design,"While sounding like a good idea, terrible engineering skills were applied. A cup here means a TINY cup. What's the point if I can't even use a coffee mug? The area to pour the water in is also narrow, and you wind up splashing some into the coffee container that is right next to it all the time. To top it off, apparently the thing doesn't seal well and the coffee grounds wind up bubbling into the water container so that the latter is always dirty. BAD."
4,1-Cup Coffeemaker,i'm very satisfied with this product. it brews quickly and in just the right amount. it's also easy to clean. the permanent filter is a stroke of genius.
4,"So Far, So Good","So far, so good on this item. It fills a great niche - I microwave for an island. We struggled for a while with the placement of a microwave when planning our kitchen. We found this and problem solved!Pros:- Cool looking- Works well- Great placement in kitchen- Very quietCons- Almost too big for standard M/W cabinets (we had to carve our enough space for it in my 24"" standard microwave cabinet)- No convection option"
1,Horrible,"I agree with the reader from La Crosse; This book is dark and scary. I can't imagine ANYONE wanting to read a story about lunatics rioting, a family running from a burning apartment, cats lost in the fire, and a reference to a ""dead body without arms""(turns out to be a mannequin) to a 4-8 year old. The the overwhelming tragedy of the story out-weighs any redeeming message that might be hidden within. Pass this one by."
4,A dog trainer who can work with dogs and people,"Seeing Bash Dibra take an aggressive, stubborn dog and turn him into a well-behaved, friendly one is one of the pleasures of attending his training classes. In his books, including this one, Dibra shares with the wider public tips that enable us to train our dogs for companionship or -- in this case -- stardom. If you think your dog could help pay the rent, this is THE book to read. And if your dog is not destined for stardom -- this book can help you make sure s/he wins friends and admirers on walks in the neighborhood."
1,"""POOR KNOCK-OFF BAGS""","DON'T BOTHER WITH THESE BAGS, THEY DO NOT COMPARE IN QUALITY COMPARED TO ORIGINAL KENMORE BAGS. THEY ARE ABOUT 1/2 AS THICK & FEEL VERY CHEAP. I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING ORIGINAL KENMORE BAGS--NOT THESE ""KNOCK OFFS""."
3,"Good, but not necessary","I have been a fan of the AoA since it came out back in '95. This volume is really only for those who want to know all of the back story. The writing is pretty decent for the most part, however, most of the issues in this book are not necessary for the core of the AoA storyline. Some issues, like X-Men Chronicles and X-Man -1, give some good back story to the entire AoA universe. The artwork ranges from alright to excellent (think Ian Churchill). This does collect the four issue Blink series and I have to say that they really don't add to the overall AoA story at all. It's more like a Blink solo adventure that has nothing to do with the AoA. So I would recommend this only to the die hard x-Men/Age of Apocalypse fan. Book 2 is really where the fun starts so I think that is a better place to start than reading this."
5,Priceless,"If you're a Jeff Dunham fan, this is definitely one of the must-haves. I don't ever EVER watch a comedy show more than once but my husband and I break this out every few months to watch again!"
5,Jeff Dunham's Very Special Christmas,"Loved, loved, loved the story of his daughter putting gas in her car for the first time. If you like to laugh, you will enjoy this."
5,Wierd But Hilarious,"I first saw Jeff Dunham a week before Christmas and the week I got out of school for winter break (This is my first day back). I first saw Spark of Insanity but my teacher meant to show this one first. I only know 2 of the puppets. Walter who is always the opening puppet is one of my favorites. My friend can do a better version of him than I can. And I also know Achmed the Dead Terrorist. I'm not sure if his arm was supossed to come off before he asked Jeff to hold him. I do my own where I ask Walter how his New Year was and he says ""When the clock struck 12, I burped and fell asleep"". Now that I'm gonna get this DVD I think we're gonna need a bigger stage."
5,jeff dunham,"Jeff Durham-----what more can you say The Best,Very funny and the puppets unreal.The Christmas CD very good and it has all fav puppets . Even Walter!"
4,"Great DVD, Laughed so much",Jeff is true to form in this DVD. He keeps you laughing from the beginning.
4,Jeff Dunham,Jeff Dunham is by far one of the WORLD's bestat his craft (ventriloquism) and is a top flightcomedian with a wry wit. Very good.
3,IT WAS EDITED,"I ordered the video and received ""EDITED"" versions. I did not see anywhere in the description where it says edited or condensed. They aren't even the whole show. I was very disappointed."
5,Jeff Dunham's Very Special Christmas Special,"Looking for a good laugh with Jeff Dunham, Walter, Peanut, Jose, and guitar guy. You will love this video and have a great laugh with every moment. This also makes a great gift for anyone that loves to watch these characters on youtube or on stage.. Hi I highly recommend picking up this video for you or make it a christmas gift for someone who appreciates a good laugh."
4,Jeff Dunham 's Christmas Special,We loved it. It will be one of our new christmas traditions to watch it.
2,Not very special,I have enjoyed Jeff Dunham and thought this would be a fun DVD. I was very disappointed with it. It definitly was not one of his funnier shows. There were a couple laughs but mostly I found it stupid and stale. Sorry Jeff you need better material.
3,"Great fun, but not for kids","I like Jeff, or is it Heff (Jalepeno on a stick) and I bought this as soon as it was available. The theme is dark for a Christmas special, and much of the material is more adult oriented. Some things that really bothered my twelve year old was the recurring references to drugs, sex and swearing. Don't get me wrong-there's some funny stuff for sure, but this is better suited for the grown-ups.Overall, you're better off getting the CD called Don't come home for Christmas. It has a lot more music, only one bleeped swear and no drug references (except beer)."
4,Good DVD but has bleeps in it,"I am a huge Jeff Dunham fan and always will, but I think it would be fair of the DVD people to allow the people to have a choice between a bleep and unbleep show. The special is still very funny and I give it four stars of course only taking away the one star because of the bleeps. I also enjoy the puppets singing made the show even funnier. So if your into the comedian Dunham and willing to put up with the bleeps then get this DVD and enjoy it for yourself or with people you care about, and make yourself a better Christmas with the DVD."
3,Not nearly as good as his first two DVD specials,"Be forewarned...this DVD is not nearly as good as Jeff's first two DVD specials.This clocks in at 90 minutes, and it does drag. The sets were far too elaborate, and were not necessary. In fact, the sets detracted from his skill as a ventriloquist.We do see Jeff's family in this special...and it may have been nice for him; it wasn't necessary for us, the TV audience.When viewed on Comedy Central, it is even worse due to the cuts made by CC due to time constraints.Stick with his first two DVDs. They were homeruns. This effort was maybe a double at best.I'd rate it at 2 1/2 stars."
5,love it,as always very hilarious. jeff dunham never dissapoints. love all the characters.we continue to be big fan.next best thing toseeing him live
5,Too funny,Characters are pretty developed and comedy is good. I do like having the option of censored vs uncensored as my 8 yr old loves Achmed.
4,Very Special Christmas review,"Very entertaining! I still think ""Spark of Insanity"" is my favorite, but his shows are always very funny!"
1,This one of his Sucked!,This show of Jeff's sucked! It was horrible compared to anything else he had done before this one. I was very disappointed in him and the shows have just gotten worse ever since. :(
2,Very funny but what's with the censorship?,"I recently found out about Jeff Dunham and have watched all 3 of his dvd's. While I find the act pretty funny, I don't understand what's up with the censorship. On his previous DVD's he either didn't censor it or he gave you the option as to which one you want to watch.Overall he gets a 4 stars for the content of the DVD and -2 stars for it being censored."
3,WHY THE ****in BLEEPS?????,"I ususally love Jff Dunham, and his DVD is funny, but what got me is its a CENSORED DVD!!!! There is NO option on this DVD to have the cuss words in or not....and that frosted my butt!!! I paid for the extended UNCUT version...and I got that crap!! I was very dissapointed, and will NOT buy one again if he chooses to release it that way."
1,Grasping for material - and missing the mark.,"We have both of his other dvds and love them!! This one should never have been targeted for Christmas (not sure why they tried - it has little actual holiday humor). His previous disks have so much funny stuff about real people, and all kinds of people, so we could all relate. This one tends to really target, with mean/almost angry humor, specific groups of people. The only part of this disk I really enjoyed was when ""Guitar Guy"" was on stage and cracking up. Other than that, this is no where near as good as his other two. I would not recommend this one."
5,great dvd,I think Jeff Dunham is great. I now have 3 of his DVD's. I have seen him in person; it was a great evening.
2,look below,"I am unable to review what I haven't recieved yet. Today is Sunday, January 24, 2010 and the Estimated Arrival: January 19, 2010"
4,Jeff Dunham's Very Special Christmas Special,"I haven't seen it yet, but if it's like his others it will be great. He is a great puppet man"
2,Disappointing,"I found this Christmas Special to be disappointing. An adult movie ""unrated"" per the write up and it is ""bleeped""."
4,The funniest terrorist ever !,"The blooper moment with Achmed will become a memorable one. When the ventriloquist himself has a hard time continuing the show, you know it's funny."
3,no disk,"The book was what i was looking for but the ""included"" disk was not there. Should have been advertised without disk"
4,Touch base with the god/dess within yourself,"This a really good and fun read. It's a lot easier to read than any of the books on mythology that I've ever read, which were quite a few! It makes you realize how much in this world is named after gods, goddesses, and heroes, from the Orpheum Theatre (which I found out is a contradiction!) to Troy's Greek Restaurant. Ms. Hathaway shows how different cultures from all over the world have the same stories with similar characters with similar names. It gives you goosebumps! While this is an easier book to read, it lacks all the drama that all those heavy mythology books have. Her book touches base with most of mythology so there is no deep study of any god or goddess. Ms. Hathaway covers not only the Greeks but Celtic, Chinese, and Norse mythology as well. The only thing that I have to say negative about the book were all the typos! There is a plethora of typos in this book. But if you're looking for a quick intro into mythology, this is your book."
5,What the other guy said- TEAR-JERKER!,"I didn't read this book until years after I bought it because I hadn't expected it to be so good... Boy, was I wrong! I gaurantee you this book will make you cry. I mean, poor Boyardee...! (read the book)"
2,Overdone,"This books writing is ok, but it's horribly overdone with cliches of cruelity perpetuated on animals by one dimensional men. I didn't finish it. It made me ill. Corkscrewing wire hangers into blind pups in a den to yank them out, etc. Yeah I get the alleyway abortion metaphor. It's lame."
2,bad shoes,"the shoes are too stiff, not flexible, I really did not like at all like the models I've seen here in Venezuela, the suit and I regretted"
2,"Clunky, Heavy, Short wear only","The shoes feel very heavy & clunky, plus they rub on my ankle bones. There is some sewing inside that I had to cover as it would rub on my foot when I was walking. I wish I had ordered the Performace shoe instead as it would have probably been more comfortable. I have been trying to break these in, but my feet really hurt by the end of the day. I will just have to figure out how to make these more comfortable. I walk daily, but have to remove my shoes as soon as I am done. I have already added gel pads, but they are not enough.Skechers Women's Energy - Atomic Sneaker"
3,Sins of the Father,"As Buffy books go, this one was pretty good. It's focus was mainly on Giles, who faced a tough challenge, so if you enjoy reading about him, this would be a good book. There was also a good storyline with a focus on Buffy and Angel, so if you are like me and love reading about their relationship, then this is a good story for you"
1,This sucks.,What a joke. It's a shame that someone with a voice like this makes such a flop. Really cocaine? You shouldn't waste your money on this. I'm sure you can pick it up a second hand shop for a quarter if you want. The song All I Can Do just about sums it up. This actually put a dent in the solid DP albums from back in the day.
1,:(,"I bought this album for 25 cents and once I realized this was Buttafly from Digable Planets I was excited to give it a listen. I have no clue what happened, but this is a complete 180 from what Digable Planets were doing. Lyrically, the album fits the mainstream rap topics of being pimp, gangsta, etc. A step back from the poetic days of Digable Planets. If you like Digable Planets don't listen to this, it might make you think less of them. Of course if you have never heard of them, then you might be able to get more joy out of this than I did."
1,Something NOT to declare!,"I had to read this book over the summer before I went back to school. Let me just say that this was the most boring books I have ever had to read. Page after page would be filled with vain, boring crap about her childhood and her supposedly humbling, amazing journey to becoming a "" wonderful "" author. The minute I finished this book, I threw it on the floor and didn't pick it up for an entire week! Later, I ended up throwing the book away. If you decide to purchase this book, spare yourself some grief and don't pay full price for this book. Trust me, even though I got it cheap, it was still a waste of money and time that I will never get back."
5,A great toaster,"I've had plenty of toasters over the last five years; mostly cheap (under $20) types. This is my first mid-priced toaster and let me say that so far it's been the best toaster ever.Even toasting, even after toasting multiple slices in one session; and it toasts twice as fast as any toaster I've used. The only thing that I can't say is how long it lasts. Most of my toasters fall apart after 6 months so I'll have to wait a little while to see how this one lasts, but absolutly no complaints at this time.(update) It's now been two years and the toaster still works as well as it did on day one! I've never been able to keep a toaster this long without it breaking on me."
3,good gift for my friend,"I gave it to my friend as a gift, because she didn't have any Calphalon cookware at the time. Anyway, the price was right and she likes it."
3,"Engaging, but lightly wanting","I was drawn into Desolation Road immediately and enjoyed the book. It begins as an intimate, slightly fey, story of misfits on a terraforming Mars finding a place for themselves in as yet undeveloped stop on a desert railway.But as it progresses towards the end it drags and what was an engaging story of a small society of misfits loses focus when the stories scope expands.I became increasingly disinterested as the story seemed to become less about the characters and more about the wider world around them.I don't think, as some reviewers say earlier, that this is McDonalds best work. I think his stories set in future India ('River of Gods' and attendant short stories) are much better."
4,Good C.D. by a classic band,"While this C.D. isn't as good as their pre '75 albums, it is still better then anything they did in the eighties.I would recommend to skip everything after Tattoo You and buy this one if your looking for a modern sounding Stones record."
4,Stones Back From 80's Wilderness,"The Stones return with a vengeance. Their best album since the mid-70's Some Girls, you can sense the reinvigorated swagger of Jagger on songs like ""I go wild"", ""Sparks will Fly"", and ""Suck on the Jugular"". After the mediocre ""Dirty Work"", ""Undercover"", and workmanlike ""Steel Wheels"", the Glimmer Twins prove they are back on top. Buy this album."
3,"Aging, yes; old, no","No one is going to confuse this album with any of the Stones' most powerful works, but they're sure not going to confuse it with albums released in wretched excess days of Post-Exile.The single ""Love is Strong"" shows a tamed Mick Jagger who is more content to growl than howl. ""Sparks will Fly"" and ""I Go Wild"" have the howl and some rather naughty lyrics as well. If Aerosmith has reduced itself to little more than cheap double-entendres-as-singles, the Stones with ""Brand New Car"" at least offer a fresh slant, even if you can ""feel the fur."" ""Out of Tears"" is a beautiful ballad, in the ""Almost Hear You Sigh"" and side two of Tattoo You vein.Though their best days are behind them, they prove here that they're still worth a listen. You'll more likely get hooked than not. ."
4,The Comeback Album,"There are a few skippable tracks here, but this album was the best set of songs the band pulled together in ages, and performed with a fire down below not seen since the mid-70s. Highlights are many, but all the rockers kick it, and Keith's two vocals are standouts. ""Moon Is Up"" will go down as one of the great underappreciated Stones album tracks."
2,Nearly Unlistenable in 2006,"For a long time, I thought this was one of the best Stones releases. However, after spending quality time with ""Bridges"" and ""Bang,"" I now see that this now-dated album does not even come close to competing with any albums that the band has ever released. This was hailed as a ""return to form,"" but when was the last time you actually listened to any of these songs:""Moon Is Up"", ""Sweethearts Together,"" ""New Faces,"" ""Blinded by Rainbows,"" ""Suck on the Jugular,"" ""The Worst,"" ""Baby, Break it Down,"" ""Mean Disposition,"" ""Brand New Car,"" ""Thru and Thru?""When was the last time the Stones themselves played any of these onstage?Really, only the first 3 songs, ""Out of Tears,"" and ""I Go Wild"" are of interest to the compilers of today. If you're really dying for ""Suck on the Jugular,"" go out and get either ""Bang""'s version of it (""Look What the Cat Dragged In"") or ""Bridges'"" version (""Juiced""). Very disappointing, 13 years later."
1,ALMOST BEYOND BELIEF,"WHATS BEYOND BELIEF IS THAT THESE GUYS CAN KEEP CHURNING OUT ONE ALBUM AFTER ANOTHER AFTER ANOTHER WITH THE SAME REDUNDANT SINGING,DRUM BEAT,GUITAR LICKS,AND HAVE SOME PEAPLE RUN OUT AND BUY STUFF LIKE THIS!JOHN LENNON SAID IN A 1971 INTERVIEW,WHILE TALKING ABOUT THE BEATLES BREAKUP,THAT HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD SCENE FOR THE STONES TO BREAK UP CAUSE THERE MUSIC WAS STARTING TO SOUND LIKE THE SAME OLD FORMULA.HISTORY HAS SHOWN THAT HE WAS RIGHT,AND HE WAS DOWN RIGHT PROPHETIC ABOUT EVERYTHING PUT OUT BY THESE GUYS IN THE LAST 25 YEARS! AVOID THIS ONE, IT SHOULD BE OUT OF PRINT!"
5,Stones,"Don't agree with the ratings of stones albums. I certainly wouldn't give satanic rquest a C. My God, 2000 man is A++++. I'd put tatoo you by the top along with Now or it's only rock and roll. Only way you can go wrong on a stones cd is to buy the greatest hits stuff. Those albums just don't have the feel. Unless it's flowers. That's a good album to listen to while going to sleep. Vodoo lounge is like a greatest hits, but they weren't hits and none came from it so don't bother. There's 22 other records that are better."
4,The best in 20 years,"I really like this album, I think its the best they have released in 20 years. Theres lots of Rock and roll here that you can dance to. The production is great!"
4,Great Album Continues Stones Soap Opera,"This represented a temporary return to form for the Stones in the '90s. It rocks like the old days and it has quite a few songs, some of which are memorable. What's most striking is that there is a return to a theme explored, in particular, on ""Let it Bleed,"" ""Exile on Main Street,"" and ""It's Only Rock 'n' Roll."" Read the printed lyrics to see what I'm talking about. ""Sparks Will Fly"" is particularly outrageous. I have a hard time believing that people don't know what this song is about -- if you've never heard it, check it out. The Stones maintain their reputation as one of the most dangerous and outre bands with this CD. There's a lot to love here, especially if you like the Stones doing that old time rock 'n' roll. Buy it and find your own favorites. ""Sweethearts Together"" perfectly sums up the giddy mood of this record."
3,And the point was...?,"I looked forward to reading this book and was thrilled when my book club chose it as a selection. For the life of me, I have no idea what we will say. I feel like I just finished a Dominick Dunne book after the plot had been extracted. I forced myself to finish this book, and I like to limit forcing myself to doing the truly necessary unpleasantries in life, like paying taxes. <P"
3,-,A lovely portrait of Savannah and all its quirks. It ddoes slow down considerably for the latter trial parts though.
5,"Amazing book, I can't put it down!","I am only 1/2 thru this book and I am kicking myself for not buying it sooner. I love True Crime books and this book kept popping up on my ""suggested"" list. I never did buy it, until this weekend. Wow wow wow! Not only is this interesting in a cultural way, it is also one of the best written books I have EVER read. The writer draws you in from the first page and every page afterwards you get more and more intrigued. The descriptions are so vivid, the characters are so memorable, the setting is so lush.... I must stop now so I can go back to reading.Get this book!!! My whole family is planning to read it as soon as I finish, then we are booking a trip to Savannah!"
5,proves once agiain that the pen is mighter than the camera,"ok, ok, ok, so the movie is ok , but nowhere near as good as the book. once agin we are shown how the written word can fill our imaginations much more than a literial filmatic translation. DON""T read this book if you want a thriller type murder straight line mystery. It is NOT that kind of book and doesn't try to be. You need to amble through Savannah with the author at the pace of Savannah ( which is greek-island-on-a-hot-afternoon pace ie SLOW. ) If you thnik that the characters can't be real , slow down and LOOK around your own place, there are chacters like Savannah's everywhere. Perhaps not so many ,so obvious, but just you watch and listen you'll find them. Americans are eccentric to me!!!! ( I'm English) . BUT achually what I really want to know is ""What happened to the Lady Chablis??Where is she now? what happened to her? .. Does anyone know? I wish her luck."
4,"Terrific, colorful reading!","Just finished Berendt's Midnight book and loved it. Couldn't wait to get home from work each evening to see what new characters I'd discover. If you want to read a mystery, this isn't the book for you. The murder and consequent trial(s) seem a small part of the book. But do read the book for the sheer pleasure of discovery. Berendt writes wonderfully and the reader is entertained with historical bits of information, image invoking descriptions of the Savannah area and its people, and often-times hilarious introductions to various colorful characters. I'm glad I finally got around to reading this book!!"
4,Nice book!!!,"I received the book in the expected time. It was in 95% good condition. The edges were a little roughed up but it could be from the shipping. It was supposed to be in new condition. I don't know if that means ""perfect"" or ""really nice"". But the book was in ""really nice"" condition."
4,A cast of memorable characters make this story work well.,"What I found amazing about this book is that the events and people were all from the author's true experience! Savannah comes to life through the unforgettable characters...the denizens of the city, who seem to transcend both time and reason. It's truly a gothic Southern tale. Relax and enjoy."
1,So bad I didn't finish the book,I heard so much hype about what a great book this was. I was working as a travel agent and a woman booked a weekend trip to Savannah because of this book. I found the book totally uninteresting. I'm sorry I wasted my money.
3,Did I miss something???,"I read this book and struggled over every word. Perhaps I readover the sentence that tied this book together.In my opinion it was just a travel brochure forSavannah,Georgia telling about the different places, and the more curious characters.I'm one of those people who thinks it's worth your while to read every book you can, but I'm having a hard time of saying that with this book:("
3,"Service was great, Book not so much.","I had heard about this book for years. Always good reports. I thought the story was worth telling but the writing was not up to the task. Too many side stories with no bearing on the real case other than to show the variety of life in Savannah.We could have learned more about the victim and the killer and less about night life they weren't involved in. Sorry, I had really looked forward to reading this book and was a little disappointed."
4,Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (Vintage),"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is a well crafted mystery/murder story. What I enjoyed most is the gossip like develepment of the characters, which were revealed in little bits and pieces. The setting was so well described that you felt like you must visit Savannah very soon and experience it for yourself. A good summer read."
1,Why???,"Why this book was so 'popular' I'll never know. I read the first 7 chapters and decided enough was enough. I don't know what I expected, but this wasn't it."
1,Very disappointed!,"This book is disappointing. There is really nothing interesting about this book to me. I am from Georgia (born and raised) and I live about 4 hours from Savannah and have visited about 5 or 6 times and love it, but this book I do not love. It is very dark, depressing and just boring in my opinion. I don't know where all the hype came from, but this book did not do it for me! I struggled just to finish it."
1,Popcorn reading,"Reading this book is like eating popcorn. You are kept busy, but you don't ingest anything of real substance. Most of the chapters are simply self-contained ""biographies"" of a particular character. There is little, if anything, tying the characters together. As far as a plot is concerned...this book has no plot! What a waste of time and money."
4,Excellent Reader,"Since all the other reviews dealt with the written word. I'll just talk about the reader. Jeff Woodman does a terrific job on this book. His voices for the characters are well done. Sometimes men have a problem doing women's voices and visa versa, not this time!! Excellent listen, good story, and so much better than the movie."
3,Three Stars,Takes a while to get into the book but then the book is good. Has a lot of history and tells a lot about Savannah
2,"Readable, but what's the fuss?","Only a 3 because a book on the bestseller list for over three years had better be great, it wasn't. Every chapter develops a character with a murder ""mystery"" to keep a thread. Yawn. Do not compare to ""In Cold Blood,"" Capote invented the fiction, non-fiction genre and is still the best."
2,Now I Know Why the Movie Died at the Box Office,I had just started to read this book when the movie came out. My wife (who had read the book much earlier) made me go see it before I had finished but it turns out that it didn't make much difference in the end (as far as spoiling the ending for me that is). That's because the book doesn't have much of an ending! I think the author just ran out of musings to jot down in his notebook. I wish I had just spent the 10 minutes reading the reviews and saved my time to read something more worthwhile. This guy won't get my money a third time!
4,Berendt proves a great guide of Savannah and its citizens,"This is one bizarre town. That's the feeling I had after reading Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. John Berendt's bestseller is a portrait of a Southern city - Savannah, Georgia, that is populated by some very unique people, each with his or her own charm, and the murder and trial of one of those citizens. Berendt's writing truly takes the reader with him for this strange yet interesting tour, whether in the home of Jim Williams, the accused murderer, Minerva, the voodoo priestess, and oc course, the Lady Chablis (need I say more ?) The access that he received lets him paint detailed character studies, as well as a narrative that keeps the reader ready for more. A unique and fascinating book."
3,utterly obnoxious protrait of a bankrupt culture,"as a chronicle of totally gross and despicable characters this book is great. as far as telling a mystery it is also quite good. however, i felt cheated at the end since the mystery is never really cleared up. so really i don't understand what the theme was besides belaboring the obvious point that if one has enough money one can get away with murder. overall a chilling portrait of thoroughly corrupt people and culture. read it if you like high class southern sleaze"
2,A general rolling of the eyes,"To use a Southernism worthy of my grandmother: ""Oh, please."" This airy, feather-weight book is nothing but the rehash of every Southern stereotype to come down the well-worn pike since long before Faulkner and Welty. We might even be talking pre-Glasgow here. I did not sigh, cry, and die as I read it. I thought, well, the sure way, once you are living in Manhattan, to get a book published is to make your way down South and see what the rubes are up to. Read Penn Warren or O'Connor if you want to soak in this murky nostalgia for the Southern eccentric. And then move on, for goodness sake"
2,I said the hell with it after plodding through 200 pages.,"I kept plodding along, page after dull page, searching for whatever it was that so many other people had apparently found interesting in this book. After more than 200 pages, I gave up. I'm forced to conclude that this was one of those cultural phenomena where people buy something or go to see something because it somehow became fashionable. And, once having been duped, nobody wants to admit it, so they continue to recommend it to others. Because of the book experience, I have no interest in seeing the movie version."
4,Good Read,"Ok, slower than I like. Like for story to move quickly. More information than I felt necessary. Still good book."
3,"Interesting story of a true crime, but was expecting more","This portrait of a crime taking place in Savannah, Georgia was ok. When I began reading Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, I hadn't realized it was a true story so that aspect intrigued me. Berendt's portrait of the quirky people of Savannah was interesting and it was incredible that it took four trials to resolve a murder charge. Although several of the characters were colorful and interesting, I'd expected much more. Reading an account of four trials for the same murder wasn't all it's cracked up to be."
2,Should have been titled The History of Savannah ....,Most of the book is just the history of Savannah as seen through the eyes of the author. I read the book in order to try to figure out the movie but since they are almost nothing alike that was no help. I will say the selection of Kevin Spacey to play Jim Williams was a stroke of genius by Clint Eastwood. The latter part of the book is much better than the first half since it deals with the real story of Jim Williams and not all the unnecessary history of the bit players.
3,A mixed bag,"The first half of this book, a guide to Savannah, its history, and its eccentrics, was quite interesting and made me want to visit there again. The second half, a blow by blow discussion of a celebrity murder trial, was dull, dull, dull."
2,I forced myself to finish it.,"This just was not an interesting book. None of the characters were very well developed, so I didn't really cared what happened to them. The first half described houses in Savannah and the second half was about a trial. The second half was a little better than the first, but I thought the book overall was a waste of time."
3,"It works, nice tools","Just trying when received this tools, with fan load and I can see 0.01 (with x10) in my clamp. But the body look not good enough."
5,root candles,"Root candles are a little pricy, but they burn nicely and have a very nice fragrance. One of my favorite!"
4,Works good if you can withstand the burning period,"This cream is good. I usually don't use creams, but I have been bicycling a lot lately and have really sore wrists and elbows. I take epsom salt baths and they help a little. This pain relief cream works pretty well. I had aching elbows and wrists and put some on and now I am pretty much back to normal. It does burn though when it's working, so if you have really sensetive skin, I would search for something else. I have sensetive skin, but I can tolerate it good enough."
2,Great Story line,"This Movie has a good storyline to it and could be betterBut the picture of this movie is terrible, it looks likethe old time film side handle rotaters. Only worth buyingif your a Lee Van Cleef fan."
2,Not worth the read..,This book is definitely not worth the read. It should be noted that it is written by an AT Kearney dude and as an ex-EDSer I can see the resemblance of the consultants that made all consultants look bad. It had no substance but choose to use big words and complex evolved scenarios to provide the pretence of intelligence. It is everything bad about a pompous consultant roled into a book. Please note that the positive reviews of this book are all from the Dallas / Fort Worth area which is home to the AT Kearney legions. I gave it a 2 only because all reading is positive and it started off good.
4,Aldrich brings focus to the digital economy,"This book is a must read for decision makers in the digital economy. Aldrich provides the reader with a clear vision of the digital landscape, he provides the labels, language and descriptions that bring it into context, and finally, he provides strategies for both the existing and start-up companies to exploit the digital age. This is a book with great predictive value."
3,Good beach read.,Picked this up practically for free and was very pleasantly surprised. It's essentially a detective novel in which the detective plays second fiddle. The story and characters are interesting. The writing is crisp. It is blissfully free of both gruesome violence and the extended sex scenes apparently required in the romance genre today. I'm actually planning to seek out the sequel Truth and Dare.Don't be turned off by the supernatural stuff in the opening pages.
3,Danger in the Dolomites,"Neil Blair is an unemployed ex-army officer. One day he bumps into his old Battery Commander Derek Engles who offers him several months' well paid work as a script writer. Indeed Engles is now a hard-bitten film director shooting in the Dolomites. To Blair, this seems like the chance of his lifetime and he thinks that his luck has turned at last. What he doesn't know is that the job also means getting caught in a breathtaking adventure with plenty of suspense and drama.An old fashioned adventure story much in the vein of what Hammond Innes usually wrote."
3,"Hoyle's Rules of Games, Third Revised and Updated Edition","Great Book of games, only problem is the print is very tiny."
2,One Bad Apple Destroys the Novel,"When John Martel started this novel, he had all the beginings of a great courtroom novel. Then he made his first mistake. He titled it, and made a title character that is so unbelievable that the novel just dissolves into a poor effort.The story revolves around the murder trial of Elliot Ashford an ex-congressman with possible mob ties. All the lawyers in this case have hidden agendas and are well thought out. Barrett Dickson and Grace Harris are very well rounded and likeable. Then enters the alternate juror Amanda Keller. An ex-actress with delusions of grandeur. She starts by slowly breaking all the rules of being a juror and then things get messy.The Keller character is so unrealistic in this novel. Martel portrays the lawyers to be very competent, but even they get fooled by Keller which is hard to believe. Martel gets two stars for the surrounding characters, but no more due to Keller"
2,Good beginning--poor follow through,"The first half of this book is a better-than-average courtroom thriller, with well drawn characters and plot twists to keep one interested. Then it starts to fall apart. The plot twists become so implausible as to be ridiculous, the characteriztion becomes inconsistent and hackneyed, the court-room scenes degenerate and largely irrelevant strands are introduced. Furthermore, the author violoates the convention that information that may be doubtful to the reader should be presented so that this is clear. Not worth the time"
5,The book proves the organization is NOT the faithful and discreet slave,"I was a witness for 20 years and in a nutshell this book explains clearly why the organization cannot be the faithful & discreet slave in Matthew 24: 45-47. The organization basis their entire existance on this scripture so when it is blown out of the water you have NOTHING left. The Watchtower is merely a small group of power hungry men trying to convince millions that they are gods chosen, when they are not. Read the book and see how obvious it is using the Watchtowers own publications."
2,Great in concept,Why isn't every 10 key like this with a screen?It should have a battery and frequently freezes up. There is a reset button that is recessed and a pain unless you have a pin.When it does work I do love it though.
3,Not what you would expect from RevCo,"This album is good in its own respect, but doesn't sound anything like the Revolting Cocks I remembered. This album might be more appealing to someone who is just getting into industrial. A true rivethead, however, would see that this album does to Revolting Cocks what Big Hit did to Nitzer Ebb, what Voyeur did to Noise Unit, or what Pulse did to Front 242. Whether that is a good or bad thing is up to you; It depends on what aspects of industrial music interest you. You won't find any hard-hitting drums, metal-grinding beats, or demonic bass riffs on this album."
1,horrid not revco in any way! sad.,"well, revco was Al, R23 and Luc Van Acker, right, cool stuff. Then it grew eventually became diluted and deservingly was laid to rest after Beers, Steers... an album that was half filler already, around some classic tracks.And over a decade later we get this? WTF? the most boring thing I've heard ... Some great names on it, but nothing like the earlier. So although they have all done great stuff in their careers, just mix Gibby, Cheap Trick, Jello Biafra, Al, and the Skatenigs, and well, it's not Revco, and it's not even remotely interesting. Gibby always sounds like he's singing Jesus built my hotrod on this, Jello is the only almost highlight, and he's appearance isn't noteworthy either. Sad. So Sad. Nothing like what revco was. they are gone, now it's just a bunch of rockers that live in Texas."
1,No way,Talk about false advertising some thing!!! This is NOT the complete series. That has over 4000 minutes in it. I looked for the complete series and this showed up. Not good.
5,hogans heroes the komplete kommandants kollection,"Hogan's Heroes: The Komplete Series, Kommandant's Kollectionhi! after buying this set i was impresed with the digital transfers from the grainy looking tapes/dvd i owned before the set. i wont review the show, because if your looking at this you know how great it was and is. the only item that inspired me to leave my feedback was everyones concern about the card board dvd holders scrathing the dvds. what i did to solve this was to take some paper dvd holders and cut them so they fit into the dvd holders slots.(just like the everybody loves raymond house looking set did) this way the dvds wont rub against the cardboard holder. the other thing i like about this is that it makes the dvds a little snugger in their case,and they are less likely to fall out. well, thats it for now hope this helps. jim"
1,Great show horrible disc,"My first set had scratches so I sent them back and Amazon replaced them, I received the second set and just started watching them and this set is worse than the last. You can watch the first 3 to 4 episodes but after that the way the disc are put into the cardboard sleeve it scratches the DVD. Again, Amazon is great and Hogans Heroes is one my favorite shows to watch, to bad the maker of this set did not take the time to create a better way to package the DVD's."
5,comments on Hogan,Love the show but the some of the disc where glue to the packaging.You might want to talk to the manufacturer on how they make the packaging.
5,A real find,I enjoyed this series when it originally ran on CBS and in periodic re-runs on other stations and cable networks since. I decided to buy while it was still available.
3,Not a great choice for a new cake maker,"The idea behind the book was great, and she does give you some very good tips if you want to read the whole thing. I tried it, and the cake came out dry and it was very hard to frost. I think that she should have helped more with the frosting tips... also the frosting recipies are very sweet and very rich in fat. There are better recipies out there that might taste better. I would only recomend this book to someone who has practice in making large cakes... it would be a great buy for a cake maker, there are some great ideas and recicies in the book, but be carefull if you do buy it and read it first."
2,The Wedding Cake Book by Dede Wilson,I thought this book with very average... It just seemed to be the some kind of work though out the book.
2,It was NOT what I had expected at all!,"I had expected to see more ideas for wedding cakes and these were NOT something people in my circle would make or eat! When writing a book like this, ALL types of readers should be considered."
3,The Wedding Cake Book,"Jonathan's service is great. good book, arrived a little slowly but due to Christmas mail."
5,All Faiths Share the Same Teaching,"This remarkable documentary features prominent scholars and mystics of many different religious and spiritual traditions who speak ""With One Voice"" in agreeing that we're all interconnected with and dependent upon one another and our world. They also agree that love, compassion, and the peace that surpasses understanding are the natural fruits of this realization, regardless of one's specific faith tradition. ""With One Voice"" is a refreshing and reassuring antidote to today's media messages that focus on religious doctrinal differences, intolerance, and radicalism. Charles Day, Des Moines, IAWith One Voice"
1,NOT GOOD,"I think this book is a horrible outline of events. First of all the author seems like he is trying to be this big wig of a motorcycle club. The book was boring and all it did was go on and on about himself (the author). It was like reading de ja vu, because one chapter would be repeating itself from another chapter. It's almost like he had nothing more to write about, so he repeated himself but re-wording it. What total nonsense. Get a life! Don't buy this, you WILL be dissappointed."
1,rusted,"i don't know why, but days after i used this product to wipe off my stainless steel refrigerator and dishwasher, rust dots began to appear on both appliances. (i used good ol' bar keeper's friend to remove the rust.)"
1,Still waiting,"I have ordered and received this DVD twice now and each time, my DVD player (even Blu Ray player, tho this DVD is not such) refuses to play the movie. So I have no idea what the movie is about or whether it is any good or anything. I am writing this just to warn prospective buyers that they may have the same problem."
5,Always get the best,"It is advisable to get the best and this original, name brand product is the best. The ones available at the local auto stores are made in India and the filter media breaks down. This is the brand recommended by my car manufacturer and Amazon has it for the same price as the off brands. Amazon ROCKS! My car now has 130,000 miles on it and still going strong due to taking care of it with the right products."
5,Excellent value,"I needed a set of cups to go with my new espresso machine and found many sets that were extremely expensive. I saw the Bormioli set of 4 on Amazon while searching the web. The price was so good that I bought 2 sets. While they are not made of crystal or fine china, and they don't come with a matching saucer, they do get the job done. I like the wire handles which are large enough to fit fat fingers. The retro coffee house feel, and the clear glass makes the espresso even more inviting. Enjoy!"
2,So so,"This book was very good, but the cover was really worn and torn a little. There were a lot of old papers in the book too!"
3,Good story.,I am a psych nurse and work with teenagers so I was interested. Its a good story about a boy who finds himself in a strange situation. I didn't love it and wouldn't read it again but it had some truth to being in a psychiatric center.
3,Book Review,"It was an ok book, have not seen the movie yet. Just a little different. Quick read, didn't hate it but not on my top favoriates."
2,"Attractive, but not long-lasting","I saw these in a swanky hotel and loved them! I got a set for my home, and used them regularly. I considered them ""expensive"", but I figured that if they stood up to regular use in a hotel, they must be durable and safe.I still consider them beautiful - they offer a candle ambiance without the soot and fire risk.I was dismayed that their light soon started to last a shorter and shorter time. I considered replacing the batteries, but considering how much I paid, I wasn't interested in spending even more money on them when they seemed to ""wear out"" in a matter of a few months.I would rate them a ""5"" if:... they were far less expensive, or... the manufacturer would provide the first set of replacement batteries free, or... they used some sort of standard rechargeable battery (I'm a big fan of rechargeables - I used them in all my battery-powered devices.)"
4,gets the job done,"I think that it looks sharp to match the other stainless in my house. the paper towel rip off doesn't work all that well, so i just use it to hold the paper towel."
2,Very loud,"This is my first time using an air purifier. I bought this one because it was on sale for $29.99. Well, I bought it because I thought it would help me with my allergy but I sneezed the whole night when I used it the first night I got it. I wonder if all air purifier makes loud noises? Because this one sounds too loud when I turn it on to medium, not even high yet. Good deal but doesn't help me at all. Maybe it helps others."
5,good nite sleep,quiet operation can sleep at nite without sneezing very good price recomend it highley
3,A good primary guide,"This book is an excellent introduction to the Five Civilized Tribes, the major nations which still existed on the American frontier and in the backwaters of the early national period of the United States. The five tribes to varying degrees attempted accommodation and cooperation with the U.S. government but in the end they were not permitted to remain in the way of the progress of the nation."
5,Best in what it is meant to be!!,Have tried all possible faucet systems but this one is little genius!! Does its job best!! The water tastes great after filtered!! Easiest possible installation any faucet filter could have and super economical in terms of refill every couple of months!! In just 3 words.. Go for it!!
3,Not Bad,"This filter is mediocre. It seems to filter the water fairly well but, the amount of water coming out of the filter could be much better."
4,"Good deal, but do not over-tighten","These filters are a b**ch to get out of the casing (maybe I'm tightening them too much, so be careful not to do that), but other than that I'm happy with Culligan. And, the new option to have it auto-shipped regularly is handy, especially because the Culligan filter doesn't have a fancy replacement indicator light."
3,"Sturdy and leak proof, but more expensive than Pur; takes force to replace filter","I got this as replacement for my Pur facet. Pur started to leak after using it for 2 months. I turned to Culligan. First time installation is easy for Culligan faucet, but changing filter is kind of a drag. The filter design is a bit awkward as you have to loosen the old filter from the bottom. I found changing Pur filter was alot easier. Culligan filter are stuck so hard in the faucet that I have to take out the entire faucet system off before changing the new filter. If you are old, forget about buying Culligan. You will have to rely on some one younger to replace the filter."
2,water filter,Just had problems with it and our faucet. tossed it and planning on getting an in-line filter instead of a faucet filter.
5,Subscribe and Forget,"I bought the Culligan faucet filter a few months back. With just me and my roommate using the filter, I started noticing some loss in filtering quality after about 2 months. I don't think it was nearly 200 gallons of water, but my water is quite hard and chlorinated and the life of the filter will be determined by the type, not just the amount, of water pumped through it. This filter life seemed to be pretty comparable to Brita and Pur filters in terms of life for me.The subscribe and save on this is a great deal. Not only does it save you some money, but it also allows you to forget about buying new filters entirely. Just wait for them to come every couple months. I am also really pleased amazon now allows 2 month recurring orders (used to be 1, 3, and 6 only). That period is about perfect for me.I recommend the Culligan faucet filter quite highly, and this filter is about the perfect deal to go with it."
4,Adaptor didn't fit.,"The faucet filter was very easy to install once I went to the plumbing supply store and purchased the correct size adaptor. It comes with two, but they didn't fit my faucet. Other than that, it works fine."
5,great product,Totally compatible and comporable in filter quality to GE FXMLC. Thanks! 2 pack would be a nice addition. hint?
2,"this is a below class ""B"" movie","First movie was OK, Second movie was like watching a train wreck, you could not stop watching-hopeing it would get better, but didn't. Third one isn't a whole lot better. I didn't know that they had made a second and third movie, after watching I can see why. It does have some OK explosions. If your a Don ""the dragon"" Wilson fan, you might like, if not, save your money"
3,Good story but not fantasy,"Cold Iron is not a bad story about a PI hired to figure out if someone is trying to murder the leader of the band. However, it is mislabeled as a fantasy book. There happen to be elves in the story but they are people like anybody else. There is nothing in the book that makes it a fantasy book."
3,Mortal Causes,It was ok. Not what I had expected after reading the reviews from other people.Mortal Causes (Inspector Rebus Novels)
2,Mistake in product number identification?,"The quality of this Braun replacement appears to be fine. However, it DOES NOT work with the Braun KFK10 product that I have. Is there some other designation that could be added so that one understands that it is NOT universal, does not fit all KFK10 models"
3,Small Slip lead,"I purchased this for my 2 dogs: one is a maltese, 4lbs. and the other is a chintese, 13 lbs. It works better with the bigger dog but I feel like they both are choking when I walk them. I try putting the collar part high up as instructed but it slips down. I'm not sure if it would work better to walk one dog at a time but then that defeats the purpose of me buying these. In any case I still use them hoping that the dogs stop pulling and therefore stop choking themselves. So far one is getting the gist of it."
4,good slip lead,"Got this slip lead for our year old pup who's had issues with slipping out of her collar and actually breaking her collar. This works perfectly for us! The quality is great, we like the leather detailing!"
3,if you're going for the whole set...,"i feel like this is the weakest of the golden collection dvds thus far. and for some reason they decided to change the packaging format this time around too which really bugs me out personally. having a collection on the shelf that vary in size is a little obnoxious.anyway, the tashlin disk on here is great! it even includes some snafu cartoons that might not be available anywhere else! but other than the tash disk, this collection isn't very desirable.the golden collection dvds are a great resource, but the way they're organized by character for the most part is pretty rough. this one is no exception. there's a full speedy gonzalas disk, which is great but hard to stomach on it's own.i recommend this for people going for the whole set, but not for a random purchase."
3,Best Bugs Bunny disc yet!,"This fourth volume in the Golden Collection series has my favorite Bugs Bunny disc yet, with plenty of favorites from the Bugs Bunny / Roadrunner Show. The Cats disc is also a welcome addition to my Looney Tunes library, with a lot of great latter-era cartoons. Unfortunately, this set also has a lame Tashlin disc and a little too much Speedy. Who decided a Tashlin disc without ""Nasty Quacks"" and ""Unruly Hare"" was a great idea?!? There was plenty of dead wood on this disc that could have been cleared away to make room for those two gems. I like Speedy's cartoons, but 15 of them in a row is a bit much, and the Daffy/Speedy short should have been replaced with ""The Road To Andalay""."
3,"good content, bad packaging","I would rate the content at 5 stars but the packaging gets 0 stars. you have to take out disc number 2 to get disc number 1 out, take out disc number 4 to get disc number 3 out. They should have stayed with the original packaging they used in volumes 1-3."
4,Where are you Foghorn Leghorn?,"Love all the releases so far. When are we going to see Foghorn Leghorn get his own volume or at a minimum his own disc??? The character is just too funny not to be given the same credit as speedy and others. For me, Foghorn ranks right alongside bugs and Daffy !!! Spent many happy hours laughing my head off at this character :) C'mon Warner, give Foghorn his due."
5,Keep them coming!!,"I remember finding the first ""Looney Tunes Golden Collection"" a few years ago at a Sam's Club. I thought that I had hit the jackpot! I love the old stuff. Cartoons were so much better before everything on T.V. had to be toned down for this poor tele-tubby loving generation. Even though I'm only 30 years old and a lot of this stuff was from when my parents were kids, I remember getting up early on Saturday morning to watch these very ones. Now I have all five of these collections and eagerly wait each year for the next one to come out to regain some of my youthful cheer."
5,cardigan vest-100% Itlian Merino Cashwool,Fabic is soft and the vest is well designed and well made.
3,Disappointed,"Although sold in the U.S., it is NOT an Americanized version of the Oxford English Dictionary. This product uses British terms and spellings.The game features draw from a separate list of words than that of the product's dictionary or thesaurus. When exposed to a new word, don't count on being able to look it up.The gaming feature also used terms that were derogatory and colloquial in nature. I felt that this was inappropriate for kids and did not lend to my overall goal in using this product."
3,Not bad to answer simple questions,"I'm fairly good with the C++ language and I just started learning the Visual C++ system. I bought this book to try to learn how to use the wizards and controls that are available... To my dismay vary few of my questions were answered. The first few chapters are pretty good at explaining how to get started and the VERY basics of some controls and other features but taking his examples and turning them into something that I could use turned out to be impossible without more information... On the otherhand. If you aren't too terribly familiar with the C++ language maybe this book is for you. The last 2/3 of the book is dedicated, not to the visual C++ but, to the C++ language itself... this is more a manual on the C++ language than on the features of Visual C++!"
5,2005 ALA Quick Pick for Reluctant Readers,"K.K. is obsessed with getting THERE when she dances to the top 40 hits of her favorite pop stars. Through luck, hard work, and the encouragement of her gay guy bud, she finds herself dancing as a back-up for one of her favorite stars, a Britney/Jessica Simpson-like Texan flanked by an overpowering mother figure. When K.K. gets THERE around this mater familia, she finds herself in a Tejas-sized heap of trouble. Balancing her dancing, her pride, and her need to scrounge up the dough to cover the tuition for her juvenile delinquent brother's reform school --- it all proves exhausting for K.K. Will she make it through the summer without breaking her dance contract or losing her realness?2005 ALA Quick Pick for Reluctant Readers"
4,Will the Real Kelly Kimball Please Stand Up?,"I really enjoyed this book, which was a great easy read, written in true form of a 17-year-old girl, where the use of proper grammar and capitalization is optional. It left me wondering, though, how much of it was true... and wanting to know more about the real Kelly Kimball, (or at least the girl who inspired her)!!! I'd love to know more about the story behind the book! Oh well, fun summer read. Fast paced, in diary, IM and email form, funny, good story."
2,Overpriced and Cumbersome,"I gave Reunion 3 stars a few months back, but after trying to print out a new set of reports, I have to downgrade it. I have spent more time trying to figure out how to get good reports and charts than I have spent doing input and research put together. Instead of allowing direct printing with lots of formatting options like FTM, Reunion tells you, if you don't like their clunky, hard-to-read reports, to send them to your word processor and reformat them yourself. Isn't formatting your data what the program is for?If you need Mac software, I would suggest checking out the less expensive programs or waiting for FTM for Mac, which I have read will be released any month now . . ."
5,damn right they call him bruce,"This was the best movie ever, i laughed so hard i cryed and i cryed so hard i laughed. If you hate good movies then stay far away from this masterpeice. why is it so good?? maybe you havent seen a crazy chinese guy eat noodles with nunchucks, but i, oh yes, i have. in closing.... thats all i have to say."
4,Not as good as the novels,"Perhaps its because I am not a great fan of the short story form, but I did not find these short stories as enticing as the full length Blandings novels. Even so, the fun is there galore and I often laughed out loud at the nonsense. Let me give an example of the kind of desciptions that makes Wodehouse a genius. Lor Emsworth looking out his telescope takes interest in a cow but: ""Presently, the cow's audience-appeal began to wane. It was a fine cow, as cows go, but, like so many cows, it lacked sustained dramatic interest"". Curiously I though Freddie Threepwood began to sound more and more like Bertie Wooster in these short stories than I had noticed in the novels.I did not really get into the Mulliner stories but perhaps this is because I am single mindedly focusing on Blandings at the minute."
5,Excellent! Great blend between practice and research!!,I have used this book with students and get very positive feedback about the book. The explanations and examples are terrific.
2,I thought something was rotting...,"I used these wipes first to clean my kitchen. About halfway through, however, I kept smelling this gross, slightly nauseating scent. I thought it was our garbage, but after sniffing that, noticing no smell at all, and then taking it out just in case, the smell was still there. As I continued to clean it kept getting stronger and I wondered if a squirrel had gotten in and maybe died in the walls. I then itched my nose with my wrist and got a large whiff of the problem- the stupid wipes.Now, I don't know if this is a problem with some of them (like maybe they went bad on the shelf before I got them due to a lack of preservatives or chemicals) or if they just all smell rancid. But I would definitely go with something else if you want a ""clean"" scent."
5,a great product!!,"I use a lot of wipes in my household, doing my part as a full-time caregiver to my ninety year old grandmother. That involves wiping down and sanitizing a lot of surfaces. We previously used a more chemically-based wipe, with a high level of bleach. That meant it really dried out and irritated the skin on my hands. Though, Method doesn't list all of the ingredients used in their Cleaning Wipes, they do mention that they are ""anti rubber glove."" I was pleasantly surprised that they were right. You don't need to use latex or rubber gloves to protect the delicate skin on your hands, when you use this product. It effectively cleans and santizes any surfaces you clean with the wipes, leaves a fresh grapefruit scent, without being abrasive. What's more, they are biodegradable and aren't tested on animals. Highly reccomended!"
3,early Irving work entertains but isn't polished,"The Water-Method Man is a good story and exhibits all of the creativity and novel plot lines that Irving is know for. But he was still 29 at the time that he wrote it. The novel is a bit rough around the edges and does not capture like his later works. If you are new to Irving, this is not the New England writer at his best. Instead, try his classics: The World According to Garp or A Prayer for Owen Meany."
4,Fit the bill,"I needed these pans to make a dinner entree of filet of sole stuffed with shrimp mousse. They were a bit shallower than the one I already had but the same capacity. They were actually better suited to what I was doing and not only cooked dinner perfectly, but unmolded without a hitch. Glad I was able to find them."
4,"Surprise endings, Hauntings, and a Bumbling writer","Most of the stories in this book are tight, well written, and present the reader with enough twist and turns to keep the pages turning. ""The Witness for the Procecution"", with the ultimate surprise ending, will always be a mystery-o-phile's favorite - and humor lovers will enjoy the ""Mystery of the Spanish Shawl"". Poriot fans will probably recognize the revamped ""Second Gong"" but it doesn't take away from the gems in this collection. All in all this is a must have for all mystery readers."
4,Earliest movie I have ever seen,"I bought this movie because it stars the great Theda Bara. I had no idea what to expect because I just wanted to start watching some of the older silent movies. This was actually very good. I did have a little trouble following the storyline but that didn't really matter. I was so captivated by Theda Bara! There was one scene where she shows her ankle...how revealing for 1915!The extras were disapointing, I was hoping for my photos of Theda Bara or a biography.It is so interesting to see who they made movies at this time!"
1,Theda Bara gets lost in the murky haze of a bad print,"I assume that all these glowing reviews are for a DVD version of ""A Fool There Was"" other than the Alpha version. This review is for the version released by Alpha. First of all, the DVD gets a one star rating just for the nice design of the DVD case. The film inside the DVD case is another story. It is dark, blurry, murky, and darn near unwatchable. I spent about five minutes trying to watch this film and finally gave up. So save your hard-earned bucks and spend it on ""A Fool There Was"" produced by Kino or some other company."
2,Not worth anything without the matching sound card from Razor,"Product sounds like garbage on the Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi Notebook Card and on my RealTek ALC-885 Onboard Sound Card. Sound was ""position relative"" while in game, but sounds weird...example: an enemy is shooting at you with a shotgun, while facing the enemy it sounds like ""tink, tink"" then you look away and it sounds like ""boom, boom"" (like it should). I contacted Razor Phone Support and they said that was ""by design""...(unless of course you have their specialized Barracuda AC-1 Sound Card). That option does nothing for me since I have a notebook though. By design doesn't make sense though, because why would sounds sound different while in game...you still can't differentiate were sounds are coming from if they have a different pitch depending on their location...retarted honestly...just defeats the purpose of having these headphones...so I returned them to Amazon."
2,Not so good.,First off. My fisrt set had a bad mic out the box. I had to call support to figure out that they had a 10% failur rate. I went back and exchanged it hopping for a non deffective Unit. The second set worked fine. Untill the metal part that hold the right earpiece broke. Completly Snaped This was 3 days after getting the headset. It broke when i was getting it of my head. No more for me.I was very upset becuase the hole motife of my computer is the razer logo i have the mouse the keyboard stickers. But now i am rocken a diffrent headset.Pros':They look niceHave nice specsCon's:Cheap manufacturing and shotty workmenship10% failur rate
1,Problems after just 3 months. Poor quality and build.,"I spent over $100.00 for my set and was disappointed by the sound quality produced by these headphones. The 5.1 directional aspect was the best thing about them. I owned a pair of Medusa 5.1 before these and they compared about the same for 5.1 reproduction. But after 3 months of ownership, first the right ear started losing sound, then static from all of the controls started. These are clunky, cheap, plastic, shoddily-put-together headphones. Looks like I'm taking a hit on these since Razor doesn't stand behind what they sell. Don't buy them. They won't last."
1,Breaks Too Easily,"I've owned two pair of the Barracuda Headphones and both have broken the exact same way. The piece that holds the earphone to the headset is made of some type of metal. After about a year to two years of use, the metal fatigues and breaks. Unfortunately, this is a key part, because the earpiece no longer connects to the headset now.When the first broke, I was disappointed but thought it might be a fluke and purchased another pair because I was happy with the sound. When the second set broke, I realized it wasn't a fluke.Oh, and the microphone stopped working."
3,razor barracuda 5.1 headphones,"Most uncomfortable headphones I have ever owned.My ears hit the inside where the speakers are, as the padding is not thick enough. These are the same as turtlebeach Ear Force HPA2. Sound is good, but not as good in surround as the zalmans I wore out. The bass is great, and they vibrate if enough bass is there."
2,"The reality is, Razer knows how to make PC accessories. The other reality is, they don't build them to last.","The reality is, Razer knows how to make PC accessories. The other reality is, they don't build them to last. After 4 months of use, the headphones stop working in the left ear. When you pay over 100 bucks for a pair of headphones, you expect them to last- and last for a really long time.The problem with Razer products overall is that they need a good basis of creating their products to last much longer than they do. They get the quality of design and ideas behind them, but not build structure. So really, I'd only recommend these headphones if you found them on the cheap- otherwise steer clear."
4,Fun movie for adults and kids,Great surprise ending with lots of action from start to finish.Good character development.
4,"Hilariously, Messy Story of 3 Women...","I loved this movie and the fact that it reflects real people with realexperiences, and, in a way that allows you to laugh WITH them andAT them.The cast does an outstanding job portraying the livesof 3 women out in the world just trying to deal with their everydaylives and relationships. Directed by Carrie Preston and Written byKellie Overbey, both talented actresses who have clearly succeeded increating something relatable and funny from the other side of thecamera."
5,I love it,"Altho discontinued, I just picked this unit up for under $25 brand new, and what a great value. It is designed very nicely; easy to operate, has excellent sound clarity in hq, and was very easy to master in no time. It is small and light, and will be perfect as I think of things I have to do while meandering thru my home or when driving. For the money, I really don't think you can go wrong (if you can find one)."
2,underpowered dont buy,"my braun multimixer lost its steam after a little more than a year of regular use. it does not have the torque to compete with other brands and stalls when mixing thick items like banana bread, especially when you add the bananas. avoid it."
3,Not bad,"Sometimes it is hard to be objective about a band that meant so much to me as a teenager. But, I have seen this band in concert and the Kilburn show is a disappointent musically. The band appears off, Townsend is trying too hard, and appears that he is agitated like he is on cocaine. Moon looks sick. Townsend even says the performance is poor, comparing it to feces, and recommending they stop filming. I agree with Townsend. No wonder it didn't get released sooner. This is an example of a professional band ""going through the motions"" for the cameras on a not very inspiring night.However, the REAL gem on this disk is the performance at the London Coliseum of Tommy in 1969. Just compare how much more relaxed Townsend is here, and his guitar play reflects it. Too bad the sound quality isn't better as it sounds like it is coming from a tin can, but the MUSIC...Wow. What a gift to be present at that show."
4,Moon Must-see,Very interesting concert. The interplay between Moonie and Pete makes for a good watch. Very well shot and audio quality is excellent.
1,Mine doesn't work at all!,"I am surprised by the only positive reviews of this item. I've tried mine exactly twice - once in a soup, once for applesauce, and both times, I got exactly nowhere. Maybe I have a dysfunctional one. But I am on the hunt for a different model for sure."
4,"Works well, easy to install...","Installation was a snap. I didn't have to use any of the extra gaskets, etc but nice to have those handy. You take off your old nozzle tip and this screws on easily. Then you run water thru it for 5-10 mins (to flush the filter). I can definitely tase the improvement, its not as good as bottled water from the store but still very good. I have no complaints other than I should have bought this years ago.I read in another review that you should not turn your faucet on full blast as that decreases the time water is filtered, only turn it on about half way. This does seen to help somewhat with the taste. And seeing as water streams out slowly from the filter, there is no need to turn the faucet on full anyways.I like that the filter lever turns itself off after using. This is a great product and a great price."
1,It can not be installed on my faucet,I can not install this product. I live in California and our apartment has normal faucet like most of the others. I just can not screw it into position of my faucet. It just does not work. This is something I never expected based on thebetter reviews of this product than the other PUR brand. It's waste of time and money for me. I am going to return it.
5,Great filter...Great price!,"I have been using the filter for 1 month and am very happy with the water quality. The filter took only minutes to install and I have had no leaks or drips. In just the first month I have been using it, it has more than paid for itself in the money I have saved from not having to buy bottled water."
5,good filter,"our water wasnt all that bad to begin with , but i thought id buy a filter to see if it could be better. well, i didnt notice much difference but my wife thinks it tastes better, and as long as she thinks it works and is happy then thats all that matters. was very very easy to instal."
5,Best faucet filter on the market!,I was using one of the other big name brands and after running out of filters switched to the Culligan. Water tastes great and the filters were cheaper. The operation is just much smoother and really looks like it is built to last. I'm very glad I switched.
3,Not too sure this is how it should work,"Just got the filter tonight, very hopeful from all the nice reviews. Very easy to install. I hate to waste water by running 10 minutes, so collected the water in a bucket.Problem:I only turned the water on to 1/6 of full pressure. Water leaks from the top (where it connects to the faucet). I also tried a PUR. The two are not so different in terms of leakage. May be there is a problem with my faucet or I should not turn water on to more than 1/6 of full pressure? OR may be this is just one filter seed so I should get a replacement and try it again?"
1,I hate this thing!,The button to switch from filtered to unfiltered water popped off and I never could get it to work quite right. I should've bought a Brita or something like that. Definitely do not recommend this.
2,Doesn't cut the taste from NYC water...,"Basically, due to the Brooklyn/New York/NYC water, the filter didn't cut enough of the city water taste out to be worth keeping. Tried running tap at half flow volume as some reviewers suggest but taste was unaffected regardless of flow rate.Returned before build durability or usable filter time could be tested."
3,good for the first day,"so after installing the unit and using it for a day, it was working fine. however, the second day, the water stream just became way too slow. i dont know if its defective but the water was trickling down. need to call to see what the problem is. the material seems sturdy and well built, just need to resolve this issue because its supposed to be a very nice one.update June 2011ok, i got a few refills, they would work for a few days, but then the water would trickle and its basically unusable. very disappointing"
1,not good for any unusual faucet,"It wouldn't fit on our faucet, it is slightly bell shaped and would not fit so it sits in the box/"
5,Great tasting water but the quality is what you pay for,"I guess I am use to Pur and Brita quality filters. I did not want to pay $50 for clean water so i went with this based on the reviews. I really can not complain. It provides great tasting water. The switch on the side that allows you to choose clean/tap water will take some getting use to but it is nice that when you turn off the water, it automaticly goes back to tap."
5,"Easy to use, easy to install, works great and a great price!",I thought I'd try this filter based on what others had said in these reviews. I was completely surprised and thrilled to find that this product met my expectations. I too have tried Brita and Pur with similar results to what others had mentioned here. The Culligan filter works as promised producing great tasting water at a price that fits my budget! No complaints!
2,No water pressure!,The water tastes good and I don't doubt that it works well. For the price and the good reviews I thought I'd give it a try. Sorry I did because it's a pain to send things back. Unless you like waiting 2 minutes to fill a glass of water I'd look elsewhere.
3,Worked great until the 2nd replacement filter was added,"I purchased and installed the filter and it worked great. I replaced the filter cartridge after 3 months. Again - great for another 3 months. When I went to replace the filter cartridge at 6 months, it leaked. I thought it was the new filter cartridge so i returned it. I tried that filter & it leaked. I took it off and tried the old filter that had worked. It too leaked, so I sent back the entire unit. I hope that works! Product is great when it works, but a hassle to replace."
2,Too good to be true,"I ordered this Culligan filter after seeing all the good reviews and comparing them to the bad ones PUR and BRITA received about how they crack and all. Culligan had good reviews, was smaller and cheaper so I'm thinking ""great."" But then I did a little research and came up with this website that compares the filters and found that culligan only filters out aesthetics (taste and odor, sediment) and chlorine while BRITA and especially PUR filter out all kinds of other chemicals as well (including lead). I guess they break and the material is not sturdy but the whole point of buying the filter (at least to me) is to drink cleaner water! So I took my chances and ordered the PUR filter despite its bad reviews. I would list the link of the website that compares the filters but I don't know if it's against amazon policy or if it will be seen as spam so I won't be doing that."
1,Filter cartridges impossible to replace,"I bought this filter a few months ago and was pretty happy with the quality of the water filtration. Installation was difficult due to the way that the faucet attachment can rotate freely (hampering your attempts to screw it onto your faucet) but you only have to install it once.Unfortunately, the filter cartridges are literally impossible to replace. The instructions claim that you should be able to unscrew the cartridge from the filter, but it won't move. I broke one of the three plastic fins off the filter cartridge trying to remove it. I'd recommend going with a water filter that has a less fragile approach to replacement cartridges."
4,almost made warranty,"I like the Culligan FM-15A water filter. Its relatively inexpensive and seems to work. There are 2 problems. 1: the valve sticks so it doesn't go back to tap water automatically 2: I think this is my 3rd one. The first 2 broke. I'm not sure how long the first one lasted, but it was longer than the pur filters i used to buy. this last one lasted 1 month shy of the 2 year warranty period, so i could send it back if i wanted to but i already bought the replacement."
5,Culligan FM-15A Level 3 Faucet Filter,"I use this filter and it worked nicely. I did not drink the water though I just cooked with it, so I do not know how it taste. I also washed my dishes and hands which where not as dry as before I used the filter. I made a household move so I have not been using one and my hands are dry, cracky and itchy again, now that I am settled, I am going to buy another one."
1,$18 down the drain,"I live in California and my local tap water is hard and bad-tasting. For decades I have been refilling gallon bottles with good water from vending machines (35 cents per gallon at the local grocery store, but the real price is in inconvenience and back pain). After reading numerous positive reviews of this in-sink filter, I had high hopes. But I have been consistently disappointed for six weeks. The water from the filter does not taste much better than plain tap water. It's not nearly as good tasting as the water from Culligan (and other) vending machines. I can't drink it, my cats refuse to drink it, and even my house plants notice the difference. Back to the vending machines!"
3,OK for the Price,"Make no mistake... you get what you pay for.This is definitely not as good as BRITA purifiers. The system installs easily and the water flow is almost immediate which makes me wonder how efficient the filtering is. Overall, Its better than not having any filter at all.. but i wouldn't buy one again.UPDATE:A year after installing it, It finally failed. A very noticeable crack appeared on the top of the filter and the water flow lost all its pressure. You get what you pay for i guess..."
5,Great Inexpensive water filter,This water filter delivers good tasting water for a inexpensive price. It was easy to install and easy to use.
5,Finally!,I can't believe I've been using the Pur filters as long as I have. They invariably leak after a month or two and start spraying water everywhere. The Culligan is great. I could not recommend it higher.
2,Slow Filter,"Does what its supposed to do for the price, only complaint is the slow filter output. Wouldn't buy it again for my other faucets."
3,Could Not Attach To My Price-Pfister Kitchen Faucet,"I gave this item a 3 star rating, because I believe I would have been happy with it if I could have used it. Unfortunately, I could not.I could not attach it to my Price-Pfister kitchen faucet. The fitting at the end of the faucet was much too small (or the fitting on the filter was much too large). The included adapters were useless and local plumbing and hardware supply stores did not have an adapter that would work. Based on my conversations with those more knowledgeable about plumbing than I, this is apparently more of a problem with the design of the faucet than with the design of the Culligan water filter.However, I thought it would be useful to warn others who might have a similar faucet design. When I ordered, I did not imagine it would be impossible to find an adapter that would allow me to attach the filter to the faucet."
1,Supplied Adapter For Faucet Connection Causes Leaks,"We have a Delta Kitchen faucet in good condition and installation of the supplied adapter and attachment resulted in leakage above filter at the adapter. Tightened carefully, untightened and retightened several times in seeking to close the leak. Was unsuccessful. Pressure of water channeled through the the unit even when filtering element was ""off"" was insufficient to wash dishes effectively. Followed all OEM directions to the ""T"". Not a good experience."
3,A good filter in a pinch...,"For the longest time we'd owned and used a GE SmartWater faucet filter. Don't know why GE decided to abandon a nice product, but they did. Having no replacement filters for the GE, we purchased a PUR filter. DO NOT BUY A PUR filter. TERRIBLE product; poorly designed. After 2 weeks needed to replace the PUR. Opted for the well rated (Amazon.com) Culligan. Install was easy. It came with a fresh new filter which was also TERRIBLE !! Water flowed through the new filter at an alarming rate and water quality was HORRIFIC. Took a last gamble on Culligan, that their original filter was malfunctioning. Ordered one replacement from Amazon. Thank goodness this one worked. I guess pride in product and quality is a thing of the past, and consumers pay the price."
2,What next?,"The water here in Dallas becomes very difficult to drink in the summer. Something about the algae in the lakes. After trying three pur filters I decided enough of these pieces of junk. Each lasted less than one summer. I purchased the Culligan FM-15A and promptly installed it. The water quality was very good. Then the bad things. About three weeks after I installed the unit, the auto-turnoff failed. It hasn't worked since. I've tried the recommend CLR treatment but no-go. And it has become increasingly difficult to turn off as time has gone by. This evening, the top of the housing cracked and started leaking. Net result, it lasted about as longas one of the pur filter units. So it's back to square one. Searching for a faucet based water filter that works and will last.Robert MegeePlano, Texas"
2,Only three weeks and already problems!,Bought this three weeks ago. Seems to filter the water okay but the valve stem has already stopped working which means you have to remember to push it back in after each use or the filter won't last every long!
2,"Don't like this, I think it's a waste of money","I don't like this. I think it's a big waste of time and money. I had a reverse osmosis water system before this, so it of course could never compare, but I thought it might at least do something for me since some of the reviews were good. The water comes out of this very slow, too slow for me to stand and wait.Just invest in a reverse osmosis water system, that's the best in the long run and then you don't have to mess with contraptions like this."
4,good deal for decent filter,"this filter is pretty decent. although after I changed the first filter, the water pressure wasn't as good as it was initially."
4,Best deal for the price,"Very good deal for the price. It was very easy to install and very easy to use. It has a little knob you pull out to go from tap water to filtered. And after you turn off the faucet, the knob goes back in, so you never forget to turn it back to tap. It's a bit large, gets in the way at times. But they all do, and this one, I think, is smaller or average compared to others. Only color option is white, but doesn't look bad as all my appliances are white. I've been using it for almost a month and am very happy with it. I was nervous at first as the water color was cloudy, but after reading the instructions, you need to run water through the filter for at least 10min, then water was clear. Water tastes good too."
3,sloooooow!,"Works great, it does screw into the faucet and will not slip, no problems there. However, because it removes the splasher, it reduces the amount of pressure that mounts in the system, making the water slow down to a trickle. I think I may stick to Brita type filter jars in the future. As a matter of fact, I fill up a jar with this water, and it takes so long a Brita filter jar would have filled by the time I get to half of the same jar... AND I have to wait there because the faucet is on! The slow trickle really is my biggest complaint, but otherwise works as described."
4,best for the price. 4.5 Stars,"After much research and review, this product seemed to be the most reliable and effective for the price. I purchased the product. Installed it in seconds very very easily. The instructions said run for 20 minutes I did an hour. It took about 5 days to break in. Now the water is odor and metal-taste free. The cost and convenience to have clean drinking water and cooking water and not carry the gallons of bottled spring water.....is not even close with massive savings.. I bought a camelback BPA bottle and now drink more water than ever. The only downside is that the stream of water is somewhat slow. BUT with the metal fastener and button (reliable) the ease of installation, effective cleaning and removal of odor and the PRICE.....this is extremely hard to beat. The unit is also small enough as to not cause any issues at the sink. 4.5 stars"
5,Impressed.,"I just moved to an older part of the country (near Boston), from Iowa. The water is VERY hard (when I filled my first glass, and let it sit for awhile there was about 1/2 teaspoon of sediment on the bottom), and this filter worked perfect. No sediment or weird taste. It takes a lot longer to fill a glass, but I am very happy. I would highly recommend this filter!"
4,Great filter!,"We bought this filter 3 months ago and really like it. It was really easy to install, I mean really easy. As easy as screw off your old faucet cover and screw on the filter. No tools needed. The water tastes great. The toggle switch to go from regular and filtered water is a nice feature too although it stops working automatically after the first filter needs to be replaced. You just have to do it manually. Good thing is that unlike a Brita filter, you can tell when to replace the filter in case you forget when you installed it. When it needs to be replaced, the water starts coming out slower, until it's only a drip.I just installed the new filter and it seems to be working fine. Great product for a great price.****UPDATE!! 2/7/11. Although the filter's been great, ours cracked and needs to be replaced after having it for under a year. We have to order another one but I think it's worth it. Beats filling up Britas."
3,Unimpressive but adequate,"We just drilled a new well and the water's a little smelly. We couldn't afford to add a whole-house filtration system, so this will have to do for now. It does seem to take the smell out of the water, but it runs very slowly. The instructions say to not run hot water through it, which is a bummer, since washing the dishes is when you really get major odor from the water. Doesn't make sense to me; we bought the showerhead filter as well, and you can run hot water through that."
4,Better than Brita for less $$$,"A 4 pack of Brita filters goes for about $20 and lasts for 160 gallons. Add the pitcher in and you're out even more cash.This costs $17 or so, and the replacement cartridges are only $11. Each lasts 200 gallons, as claimed. Plus, you get water right when you need it, no waiting for that slow, slow pitcher.The downside is that if you've got hard water like me, the entire unit will begin to malfunction in about 6 months due to the valve clogging up. Still a good value at $30 for 400 gallons of filtration, but not perfect."
2,Leaks,"It's leaking from the bottom after changing filters for the third time. On top of that, I see particulate floating in the water. I have one more filter and once that's used it's back to Pur."
2,I really wanted to love this filter system,"After having to replace the whole PUR faucet system multiple times due to cracks and leaks I was happy to try this system with its 5 year warranty. Easy to put on , replace filters, inexpensive! However, I cannot drink the water from this as the taste is so inferior to the PUR. So now I use this water for cooking and my animals and have a PUR pitcher in my frig..."
4,Great little filter!,This is a great little filter. Not big and bulky like the PUR filter I had before the Culligan. The only thing that threw me off a bit when I received it was the Mnfg. date on the box. It said 2003. Somebody somewhere must have bought a whole sh_t load of these things and had trouble getting rid of them for awhile. I don't know what the life span for the filter element is. Seven years seems like a long time to me! But it does take the chlorine smell out of my water and makes it taste clean.
1,Do not recommend!,Thought the adapter would work on my tap as it is fairly new(pull-out type with sprayer) but of course it didn't. Bought this while back and have yet to get the proper adapter. Was going to send it back but it's more of a hassle than what it is worth. Culligan should really get a modern adapter as most people don't have old taps!!!! Guess I will never know how it works until maybe oneday I do find the right one!!!
2,Destroys your unfiltered water flow.,This filter reduces your *nonfiltered* water flow by over 40% Unbelievable and useless unless you can up the pressure hugely.Water tastes fine. Poor flow through design absolutely ruins this thing. Pur at least allows the water through.
5,Great product,The product did all that was promised and was what I needed. It mounted solidly and produced quality water that was the end goal for this product.
1,Lousy DVD transfer from Madacy,"This is a marvelously produced and very well acted TV miniseries. What a shame that Madacy released it and no other company picked it up. After approximately the first hour (maybe 65 minutes) of play, the soundtrack goes out of sync. There's probably a 3-minute lag between visuals and the appropriate sound. Mouths open without sound and, conversely, a male voice may be connected with a female visual. -- Inexcusable!"
4,very educationale,Good book on learning how a monitor works. The bad thing is that monitors with picture tubes are out of production now so if you want to get this book plan on learning about old technology. There is one chaper in this book that does have info on how flat panel monitors workThe book does have a lot of tips on things to look for relative to the problems you might be having with your monitor. If you like video technology this is a good book on how your monitor works.
2,Too much Greek Bashing!!,"Although I had high hopes for this book it ultimately disappoints. It is too long-winded and the story never maintains a smooth flow.Even though Thoth narrates the story from an Egyptian point of view the Greek bashing that goes on continuously does not convey the feeling that it is made as an aid to understand the differences in the cultures or people but simply as a mechanism to demean Greeks and Greece as a whole.As for extensive research, that may be true for the historical facts, but when Sprott uses Greek words or phrases as a wow-he-is-so-learned factor he would have done much better if he employed any Greek school kid as an advisor.Lastly, in which Greek tourist trap did he ever learn that moussakka was a food eaten by ancient greeks???!!!!"
1,Abysmal,This movie was shot on an old 1980's camcorder.It shows one man sitting at a table with stuffed animals.Then it gets weird.He then takes the movie in another Direction.He goes about the town with a watermelon (which he has fastened a picture of one Anthony Cummia).He takes the watermelon skating and then for a late dinner by candle light.
1,Collateral,Not enough rock and roll. Only three songs were any good. But the one's I liked were great!
4,not as pictured,"Fits fine. not as pictured, has 1/3 the pleats.Is that a big deal? It's an air filter IMO.Price about the same as local discount auto chain."
5,Very Well Done!!!,"Aviation enthusiasts must see, this is historical film not seen before, reconstructed air craft flying, and an in depth look how flight progressed during World War One. My hats off to the Ausies for this wonderful set of four hours of aviation History."
3,STOP AND KILL THE ROSES,"With a band name more suggestive of a cheap packet of garden seeds, as opposed to anything Greenday may covet, Garden Variety's 1996 debut has 15 tracks, all sounding like an angrier Superchunk, and all nearly interchangable in their similiarity. This can be a bad thing for half-listening ears; the drone of these punkish songs may sound like the same song repeating, and a good thing for the attentive, who may find the exceptional hoarse garage vocals, constant guitar, and loud drums, pounding the same path in each song deceiving, as it leaves subtle progressions and changes to the sonic landscape, more revealing in it's totality, than the sum of it's parts, like a plot of bare earth becoming a garden with a little help from Miracle-Gro. Drummer Joe Gorelick created the cool street scene artwork on the CD front and back cover, looking like the work of an excited Van Gogh after an outing with Greenday."
3,Decent Heater,"Got this heater about 3 months ago to use under my desk at work to keep my feet warm (there's a bad draft along the floor in my office). It does sometimes turn off at inconvenient times and I have to fiddle with the settings/dials to get it to kick back on again. Then at other times it's down-right HOT and I have to cut it off. There's really no significant correlation between the air temp and when it goes off and on. It's very finicky. Anyway, for the money and that it's safe, it's a decent heater and does the job about 75% of the time."
1,A heater is supposed to... heat,Not only does it have a very strong plastic odor that is overwhelming but it does not put out much heat at all. It barely blows out and I have to be inches from it to feel any heat what-so-ever. I would send it back but I really dont want to bother with all that. I would choose another heater for sure.
1,"No, No, No...Do Not Buy This Item","i don't write reviews, either i forget or i'm happy so it's not important. however, this mistake i cannot forget. i figured for fifteen bucks i'd just buy two and heat different rooms on the cheap. these two little bastids cost more to run in the winter than my 10,000 btu air conditioner in the summer. on top of that, they don't heat. i don't know why, coils get red, fan occasionally spins, but i'm still layering sweatshirts and socks to keep warm. not to mention they feel cheap, have no shut-off switch, and thermostat control (!) is worthless. i cannot stress enough, do not buy this. buy any other heater. buy a nice robe. get a dog from the shelter. get married. anything else in the long run will be cheaper and more satisfying than this stupid little piece o' junk."
1,hot air goes off all the time,"The hot air is from the fan, but the hot air goes off all the time, and it becomes cold again once the hot air is away. I put it near my feet, but it can even hardly keep my feet warm.... :("
5,Great Heater For Office,"My office has large windows and was freezing cold in the winter. For the price, this heater is amazing. In fact, sometimes my office is now too hot and I have to turn it down. Also, the heater makes very little noise. I have trouble blocking out background noise but don't even notice it with this heater."
1,bad pricing...,this item is either the wrong heater or the price is wrong....most paid under $20.00 and it's now listed for 59.99. I ordered it thinking I was ordering a different unit and now can't cancel the order. I'll be better off paying the postage shipping it back and getting a refund and buying it somewhere else for the 60.00 I've been charged....
4,Great little heater for the money,"Pros:1) This heater is effective and quiet. I'm surprised at how quiet it is, given that is has a propeller fan (not a centrifugal fan), but it is sometimes hard to tell that it is ""on"", it is so quiet.2) The design is excellent. Very stable (even though it looks tippy). High quality plastic casing. Nice molded handle at the upper rear that makes it easy to pick it up and move it.Cons:1) The controls are hard to read; I had to actually read the instruction manual to see where the markings on the controls are located. The markings are embossed into the white plastic without contrasting color.2) It lacks an on/off switch (I unplug it to turn it off).I almost gave it 5 stars because of its very high cost/benefit ratio. It is not perfect, but is a great value for the relatively low price."
2,Quits as soon as room starts to warm up.,"It would seem the safety switch in this is just a little too sensitive to heat. I know they say not for bathroom use, but we put it well away from where it could get water on it. It will shut off in 5 minutes or less just about the time restroom is starting to get warm enuf to hop in the shower. End up having to turn furnace up and heat the whole house, which is a waste of heat as we are both leaving within the half hour. The bathroom and bedroom are 5 feet apart, use a radiator type heater in the bedroom at night, which does very well to keep the chill out of the bedroom."
3,"Good heater, Bad controls","It works well and is a small size. It's not too noisy.BUT, the dial controls have NO notations on them. They do not match the manual so I have no idea how to setup the option to keep from freezing. They are just dials with notches on them.The other thing I don't like is that it doesn't turn off, off. It seems like you can only turn off the heat switch, but the fan can still be active."
2,Good while it lasted,"This little space heater was good while it lasted. It warmed up my little bathroom in the spring. It wasn't hot to the touch so it lived up to it's name: SafeHeat. However, the thing died after a mere 5 months. I tried unplugging it for a day and switching it on again but it refuses to work at all. While the product wasn't crazy expensive, it's still a waste of $15. It's not worth the cost of shipping it back. I will not buy this product again."
3,okay for tiny insulated rooms,"Works great for my 9 x 10 room but in my 13 x 15 bedroom it runs runs runs and won't heat it. You get what you pay for, just fyi. Beats paying $200 for a fancy fake fireplace that does the same thing as a little 1500 watt space heater, though."
4,"Energy sucker, but price can't be beat!","I purchased the DeLonghi DFH132 from Amazon a few months ago and here I am ordering another for the kitchen. It gets pretty cold in Northern California, and having a personal heater that provides immediate warmth really increases productivity. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a heater for a small space."
1,I got a bad unit,Mine had a very loud rattle (Maybe it was defective.) In addition the control dials are not well marked and a bit difficult to turn.
1,DON'T BUY DELONGHI!! THEY ARE JUNK!!!!!,"I bought a DeLonghi heater 3 years ago, only used it for a few months out of the year, and it died! Cheap junk!!"
2,Do Not Buy,This heater is very unnerving; it shuts off every 10 minutes. I bought this heater for office use and am very disappointed with its performance. A co-worker/friend recommended it to me. We are now strictly co-workers.
4,Pretty Good,"Product does work good, however when you put it in a less open area the thermostat is a pain in the rear. It always thinks it is warm & shuts off."
5,Excellent,This is a great little heater. Especially good for those who work in an office and the boss is to cheap to turn up the heat in the winter. Shuts off on it's own when it reaches the temp you want. Well worth the money!
1,doesn't stay on,"I've had this thing for a day now and can't get it to stay on for more than a minute or two. The only way I can get it to turn back on is to unplug it for a few minutes (as the directions suggest), then plug it back in. Works great for another 2 minutes, then turns itself off again. Plus, what's up with heaters that have no handle or off switch, like this one? I'm returning it."
1,review of delonghi heater,"I purchased this heater and the ""safety"" feature doesn't work. I guess you get what you pay for!The heater does work but there is no on/off switch so you have to unplug it from the wall to shut it off/turn it on. When you plug/unplug the unit, you can see an electrical ""spark"".Not a very safe unit. And, will not be worth the time or effort to return since it was only 15 dollars.."
2,"shuts off too often, hard to restart","although i am very happy with my little Holmes heater, thought i would try something different for my second heater. seemed like a good idea at the time, from the description. unfortunately, when it shuts off at the ""right"" temperature, it doesn't restart easily. it also does not get very warm. returned the product, and bought my second Holmes heater."
4,just right to heat up bathroom without having to heat the whole house,"I had a little trouble figuring out how to turn it on and get it to blow warm air but once that was doone, it has been perfect for the purpose for which I bought it. I am careful to make sure I turn it off and unplug it before I leave the room."
1,Broken upon arrival...,"I was all excited to get this heater and have a nice warm bathroom when I showered. However, I unpacked it, plugged it in, and the fan wouldn't work. The heating element worked but the fan wouldn't turn. I won't be getting another one of this brand. It's the first time ever that I have received something broken from Amazon."
2,"SAVE YOUR TIME, MONEY, AND EARS","This CD only get two stars because of the beats and not for Dwele singing. Dwele couldn't hold a note if his life depended on it. I'm sure anyone with a decent voice could ""sing-talk"" a song to music. My honest approach is to purchase the only good song on the album in the form on the single: Find A Way.However, Find A Way did remind me of one of Musiq's song maybe that's why I liked it."
4,Very Relaxing Material,"I first heard Dwele on Tainted and then I heard Find A Way..I didnt think about getting his album at all because I didnt really know what to expect from him..I guess I assumed that his album would be lumped under neo-soul, but that doesnt mean that all ""neo-soul"" tagged albums are all that good..But just a couple of days ago, I was listening to an online radio station and heard some of his songs..Damn, they were smooth!! The songs that I like the most are- Angel (interlude), Day at a time, Subject, Hold on and Kick out of you (my ultimate favorite from the album)..Though his voice leaves something to be desired, it is smooth enough to hold down this album along with the incredible vibe given from the beats..Its a nice album to put on when you just want to relax...It would be nice to hear what else this man has to offer!!"
3,It's ok...,"I wanted to be able to give Dwele a higher score, but quite frankly, his album kind of bores me.I find myself skipping to ""Subject"" and re-playing it over and over again. Nothing else on the album really stands out to me except ""Sho Ya Right.""It's an ok one for him, but when I listen to his voice I know he could have done better."
2,"Dwele, ""Subject""","I usually love neo-soul but this album is boring. Most of his songs sound the same because Dwele sings in one tone and does that ""speak-singing"" category that Musiq also does. The only interesting tracks are the new version of 'Lady at Mahogany' (the old one is on one of his underground albums), the remake of 'I Get a Kick Out of You' and 'Hold On', what Eric Roberson gave to him (the remix with Kanye West and Consequence is even better; it would have lit this album up if included). Better luck next time, Dwele."
1,Horrible Service - Forzieri,The sunglasses came unassembled and were defective. Forzieri wouldn't give me return instructions in a timely manner. I will never buy on amazon or Forzieri again after this experience.
2,"GREAT MUSIC, SEXIST SONGS, BAD MARKETING IDEA","The intentions are good. So is the choice of music. But the title, ""That's What Little Boys Are Made Of,"" is --- boy, oh, boy! --- simply sexist. To claim the tunes found here --- from Allan Sherman's live take on ""Hello Muddah, Hello Fuddah!"" to Gene Autry's vintage ""Bucky the Bronco"" to the nifty Danny and the Dino-mites ditty ""Do the Dinosaur"" --- are meant just for the pleasure of little boys is appalling. Music For Little People, the noted company that distributed this title (and the equally sexist ""That's What Little Girls Are Made Of"") should know better."
5,as good as everyone says it is,"I've been playing with GPS since before the constellation was complete and I feel like I have pretty realistic expectations for GPS receivers - commercial and consumer. I've got a healthy respect for Garmin consumer receivers: I've owned 4 different models.I also know from experience how difficult and slow it can be to get a cold start.This unit is remarkably fast in acquiring the satellites and impressive in its performance indoors. The screen is bright, the user interface is intuitive, and the feature set is very, very complete. I honestly cannot think of anything I would add to the 'wish list'.I admit that I had serious doubts about the performance claims of this unit, but it REALLY is surprising.The sensors are novel (I also have a GPSMAP 76S) and fun. The compass draws a lot of battery (relatively speaking) and may or may not meet your expectations. The pressure sensor (altimeter) is interesting, if you understand its limitations, it can be useful."
2,garmin gps only works with garmin maps,next gps i will buy is a magellan triton 2000 and then use the national georaphics topo maps. the best hiking gps/map combination available in the market today.
1,lost customer,All I can say is the unit looked nice as to how well it worked I can't really say since the first time I went to use it to go fishing the button which connects the unit to the belt clip (with the tinyest screw I ever saw ) broke clean off whith ease and sunk to the bottom of the ocean . after reporting this to the sellor Amazon they coulc care less . ever wonder why you can't leave them feedback it's probebly cuz they would have the worst rating of all sellors . thanks for nothing Amazon !
5,Still learning all the functions.,"We received our GPS very quickly. I only had about a week to play with it before using it on our 2 week vacation out to the Southwest. I also bought the Topo 2008 software. It had enough road info for me as we took mostly major roads and we had other maps also. I mainly bought if for the ""Geocaching"". But on this trip it helped more than a few times with navigating and identifing landmarks and rivers and such. Lots of fun to play with. And as I said we learned new stuff along the way as we went.It is a very powerfull tool."
4,Garmin 60CSx,I bought this unit for hunting and it exceeded my expectations. However the map on this unit has no detail. When buying this unit one will need to get the topo map along with it.
4,"Solid unit,","Unit works well, we use them in our fire department for keeping up with units on brush fires and and search operations. Seem to hold up well and easy to use. Wish the menu screens for navigating could be modified to show coordinates without switching screens."
4,Greatly improved support,"Having read several complaints regarding customer support, I was prepared for a lengthy wait and little or no real help. I was totally wrong: I had a human being on the line(Andrew)within five minutes. Andrew tells me Garmin has added over forty new support people. He took as much time as needed with no urgency at all. If the wait is usually as short and the support so hassle free, then the rest of the hardware/software industry should take notice."
4,Garmin GPSMap 60csx Handheld,"So far Sooo good, to date this gps keeps making me smile. I had the etrek, which for my use was very limited. The 60csx gives me more options for tracking and recording and expanding. The screen is clear and bright. You must read the instructions and follow them but once you get used to them its smoth sailing. Only problem I've seen is in day light you have to angle the screen of the sun washes the picture out but thats an easy fix. Love this unit."
4,Awesome GPS once you have it setup,"My fiancee and I used this GPS while hiking the Long Trail through Vermont last fall, and were happy with the results. We were almost always able to get a reading within 10 feet or so, and the battery life was truly impressive. This unit did everything we needed it to do very well and with little fuss. Out on the trail, I'd take this GPS with me anytime.So why didn't I rate it five stars? I had a TERRIBLE time trying to get the maps installed from the Garmin website. It was an endless amount of frustration trying to work through the website, which constantly told me that I did not have the correct unit for the maps I was trying to buy. I definitely did have the correct GPS and was just trying to buy basic maps of the US. This was the only major negative that I experienced, but it was enough of a pain to remove a star from the rating."
4,Garmin GPSMap 60CSx,"This is a great GPS with good performance. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is, that because of it's multiple capabilities, it is somewhat complex and might not qualify as a ""user friendly"" unit for some people. Anyone buying one of these should understand that until it is loaded with the proper navigation software, (About $116.00 plus tax and shipping.) it is not capable of a detailed navigation display. Since it only comes with a 64K memory chip, it will also be necessary to install a larger memory chip to accommodate the software. (I would recommend 1 GB) This will cost anywhere from 30 to 90 dollars, depending on whether you can find one on sale or not. I did have to contact Garmin on one occasion, and was impressed with their support. If you are looking for a great handheld, I would recommend it unless you want complete performance right out of the box."
4,Somewhat difficult to operate,"I have only used a few times, had to order TOPO map as the map that comes on the unit is about useless. Still having some difficulty using all the features, maybe it's me but instructions are not real clear on the operation. Will have to see with more time and usage."
5,Never get lost,"Bought this Garmin to go out on the AT for the first time, when it arrived it took a few days to figure out how to navigate with it but wasnt too difficult to learn. I highly recommend using it as much as you can before you take it out on a hike, again took it out on the Georgia part of the AT after I had downloaded the way points into it. The Garmin worked without any problems, kept us informed of where we were and how much further we had to go until the next watering hole and camp site.It is unfortunate you have to buy a topo map to go along with this or any unit as they can sometimes run as much as the unit but well worth it when you get it set up."
5,Owner,This handheld GPS unit is a great unit and has already provided me with many hours of Geocaching fun. I would suggest this GPS for this or any other navigation needs.
5,CSx,"Great GPS, The maps on this model were not sufficient for my search and rescue needs (no topo or local roads) so i had to make an additional map program purchase"
5,Great unit,The Garmin 60Csx unit performs very well. Its reception of satellite signal is outstanding. It even tracks inside buildings. The case package and belt clip is durable. The display is bright and clear both in bright light and darkness with its back light. The user interface menu is a little awkward but navigate able once accustom to. I purchased this unit with Garmin MapSource U.S. Eastern Parks Topographical. I am very happy with this hiking GPS.
4,So far so good.,"I have had my unit for only a month and it works extremely well. It picks up 8 to 12 satellites and is accurate to about 11 feet. I have down loaded tracks and waypoints to aerial photos using some free software and they are dead on. I even get excellent results with the GPS sitting in the front seat of the car. I use it professionally to map forestry and other projects. It works great. I have not tried the navigation or other features so I can't comment on them.The only down side is that I need to use third party software to down load tracks so that I can use them in my GIS programs. (ArcView and Manifold). Garmin should provide this with the package. It would make life easier and probably increase their sales to professionals. If you need the free software, go to the web and seach MSDNR Garmin (Minnisota Department of Natural Resources). Download the program and read the help file. It is not too complicated and works just fine."
1,Beware Garmin Customer Service,"Downloaded a map of london onto the unit and it wiped out my Topo US 24k West SD chip. On line at Garmin does not warn you of this prior to download. Customer Service said they could not make this up to me and basically they were sorry that their site does not address the issue prior to download. They stated you have to by a blank SD chip to download another map even though the online download states there is room to download additional maps. Garmin makes a good product and this GPS is one of the best. Their corporate greed is problematic. They have lost me as a customer, though they do not really care."
4,Great trail hiking/workout companion,"I really appreciate the average speed, distance traveled, moving time, elevation gained information at my fingertips. Oh yeah, the map and route information have also been great for keeping me on track and finding my destination when the trail information was a bit sketchy. I've had my Garmin for about a month now and have used it on about 4 hikes. I like to incorporate a workout into some of my hikes and find that this unit is great for that because of the features I mentioned above. I would only want that I could add more detailed 7.5 minute USGS topographic maps. It seems that only the Garmin TOPO product can be used with this GPS and they appear to be only as detailed as 1:100,000 scale...not really enough detail for what I'd really like. Regardless, it's a product ""headed"" in the right direction for me."
5,Sturdy and reliable GPS navigator,"The Garmin 60csx wins hands down in almost every outdoor situation I've been in. On or off road, the unit holds a steady lock whether navigating through dense concrete jungles or under the thickest forest canopy. The solid build of the 60csx is very reassuring - it doesn't squeak nor feel flimsy compared to the newer Garmin 62 series. I will bring this 60csx anywhere, anytime!"
3,Much too Complicated,"I have used this unit quite a few times but find it way too complicated. The instruction material leaves things very vague. For instance, I haven't been able to use it to retrace my steps after going for a hike. Plus it would be nice if you didn't have to constantly keep your eye on the screen. Maybe a voice prompt would help. I don't think I would recommend this unit."
5,New GPS User,"Did a fair amount of research on GPS for hiking/geocaching. This model really stood out. I have owned it for exactly one week. There is a fairly steep learning curve, be prepared to spend some time reading the manual and trying out the features. I used it on a 6-hour hike this weekend, mostly to log waypoints and gather data about the hike. It was fabulous. Haven't used it to retrack or geocache yet, but for my initial trial hike it was extraordinarily satisfying. I haven't bought the extra maps yet -- those will be an enhancement, I'm sure. A truly great toy."
5,geocaching,got this for geocaching and it works great gets me to 3ft away from the cache with it raining outside.. this one good for being deep in the woods
5,GPS and More,"Exactly what we needed for both finding our way around town and while out on the trails. Durable, rugged, small, easy to use."
2,No Maps,"Nice looking unit, everything seems to work, GPS, compass, altimiter, but it does not come with any maps, the map page is blank. Of course you can buy them for $100 from Garmin. All the advertisements say this unit comes with a base map, don't believe it. I plan to return this for false advertising."
3,Decent GPS for biking,"The 60CSx was purchased for a bike tour in Spain as their would be no maps only way points. While the GPS functioned perfectly, the screen lacks the contrast to easily pick out the correct route in bright daylight. This led to some interesting excursions in unfamiliar places. Locally I use the ""dashboard"" screen to provide max. speed, avg.speed, trip miles, elapsed time, time stopped, altitude, etc. The 60CSx agrees within .1 of a mile with my regular bike computer that has been calibrated to the actual tire diameter. This unit will operate on two AA NiCDs, but I perfer to use Alkalines as they lasts for weeks before being replaced."
5,almost perfect GPS,I received this GPS on time with a great service from the seller. This GPS is one of the few products that works exactly as advertise and exceeded my expectations.
2,Will not work with Mac -- even with Windows NT/Parallels,"Garmin announced in early 2006 that they planned to make all of their hardware and software Mac-compatible by the end of 2006, but there have been no further announcements, and there are no rumors suggesting progress.If you are a Mac user, do not purchase this or any other Garmin product which requires or allows uploads of maps, new software or waypoints unless you have access to a PC.Garmin will not license it's proprietary USB drivers (which are said to be quite flaky, even on PCs), so Mac users are locked out of the Garmin world until further notice."
2,Go Placidly,"Going placidly is a nice way to go. This is only possible if you have someone else to pay your tuition and costs of living. Find yourself a rich person, marry them and go spongeing your way to placidity Like Max. If you are born poor, forget the whole idea. Instead, go steal the life-sized statue of him in Indiana and sell it to a metal recycler. Then, you can go placidly for a month or so.Nice theory though."
2,Good CD player BAD radio,"The first CD player had such bad FM radio reception that I contacted Sony and was told to return it. I got another one, and the FM reception is almost as bad, so I've realized that it is the player itself. There is an incredible amount of bleed-over from one station to another even though it has a digital tuner. It is not just a matter of poor reception. The stations play fine on other portable devices; it's that the radio on this player is VERY POOR."
3,Nice minimal House/Techno record,"This album's really good, but I'm giving it 3 stars because there's a lot of vocals on here, which I'm not the biggest fan of, but for most of the tracks the vocals seem to work. If your a fan of anything on Force INC. or Force tracks, then you'll love this record."
1,Slow...very...slow....,"this book wasnt really bad, but i wouldnt recommend it. it was full of problems that you think are going to be solved at the end, and the ending is one of those where you sit there and go ""ok.....and the point of this was ...what?"""
1,What's worse than awful?,This book? I can't even begin to write about how bad this book is. The story jumped (if you can call it a story) and the characters were annoying. The one thing I was was grateful for was that I checked this out from the library. Save your money and your time... don't read this one.
4,A little too close to home?,"I have never laughed as much as I did reading this book. Everything you have ever imagioned about yourself and others in here in all it's glorious humor. So, I highly recommend this for all gals who want to confront a friend or even your own demons. It is hilarious and you will enjoy it fully."
4,A great book for women!,"Men, don't pick this one up any faster than ""Ya-ya Sisterhood,"" but ladies, this is a pleasure read. The plot between the client and boss relationship is sure to catch your interest. A charming, quick read! You're sure to enjoy it!"
2,Hated It,"This book isn't worth your time to read. I have read a few other books that have identical themes. ""Good In Bed"" was an excellent book that I read before reading this book and it was 100 times better. It was poorly written and not very humorous. I had to struggle to finish it."
1,Boring,"Boring, meandering story line and under developed characters. I did not find this book funny but instead just found it tedious. There were too many characters for the story line and none of them were interesting or had any depth. I found myself losing tack of who was who among the supporting characters, and I never get a real sense of who the main character was."
3,very slow start but ends up with a little more depth,I thought this book developed too slowly. I only hung in there because of all of the great reviews. It did develop some depth later on in the book but overall I felt this was just an average book. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend as a must-read.
2,series of wisecracks masquerading as a book,"Be warned: I could not complete this book. It did not keep my interest.This review is based on the first half of the book.I bought it based on the reference to Bridget Jones on the back cover. The only thing GIRLS' POKER NIGHT shares with Bridget Jones is a female protagonist. Although Bridget Jones is written in a similar ""diary""-style, it still manages to develop characters and build a plot. As a script for a comedy show, Girl's Poker Night works. It's not a book insomuch as it is a series of wisecracks, sometimes witty, sometimes contrived. If you like watching tv shows where unlikeable characters trade barbs and quick rejoinders, then this book is for you. If you're looking for ""chick-lit"" with character development and a plot, try Katie Fforde."
4,Poker Night is more than just about cards.,"Jill A. Davis has written a book that reflects her humor and fast paced wit. Once a writer for The David Letterman Show, and a five-time Emmy nominee, I can see where her quirky style gets its roots. The captivating one-liners never stop.The main character, Ruby Capote, is a writer who has trouble being serious. She will do anything to avoid confrontation, and humor seems to be the flavor of the day. After the loss of her father, not once but twice, Ruby has issues about commitment. Between working out her angst with a mixed cast of girlfriends that spice up the pot, and a potential love affair on the horizon, GIRLS' POKER NIGHT reaches an unexpected combination of delight and depth. Is there love in the air for Ruby, or will she descend to the conclusion that all men leave?Either way this debut novel will capture the reader's attention from beginning to end. ..."
5,Book Club Hit-o-rama,"We loved it. All of us. That never happens. Half of us are married, half single and dating, and in each case all saw parts of ourselves in Ruby Capote.This wonderful character seems to feel so unworthy (at first) and her journey toward becoming a more complete person, who loves and trusts is wonderful, beyond hilarious, and so absolutely true to life!We played poker, discussed the book, and felt like we were Girls' Poker Night! It was a great night. We also had all underlined our favorite passages and chapters and read from them - which was really funny!Can't wait to see what happens to the girls next!"
2,A bit disappointing...,"I am sadly disappointed by this book. The plates are sporadically placed throughout the book, and some species of birds are not illustrated. For example, what does a Greater Antillean Grackle look like? There is a brief description in the text, but will I be able to differentiate between it and a Great-tailed Grackle?There are no distribution maps either, so I have to rely on checklists printed from my Thayer's Birder's Diary program to determine which species to expect in, say, the Cayman Islands.I will be field testing this guide in May 2002 and may have a better feel for the usefulness, or lack thereof, of this book. Meanwhile, studying the birds prior to my trip is a bit cumbersome due to the design of this book. In any event, would recommend a North American supplement for any trip to the region."
1,"Review of ""Birds of the West Indies.""","Unless one is collecting Peterson Field Guides, I do not recommend this book. Its organization is dated. Color plates are segregated from the bird descriptions. Many of the descriptions are accompanied by a black and white sketch. Some of the birds described lack any sketch or color plate. The book does not contain distribution maps. Redeeming aspects of the book are (1) it is small in size and (2) it includes a comprehensive list of species in the area with a written text for each."
4,"Bond, not birds.",This is a must have for any James Bond afficionado. I couldn't testify as to it's usefullness in the field. Arrived promptly and in excellent condition.
4,Cry Baby,"I thought that ""Cry Baby"" was a really good book for teens to read. It has a lot of issues in it that a lot of teen girls (and maybe even teen guys) can relate to.Samantha is not exactly going through the best time in her life right now. One of her friends may be anorexic, her mother is pregnant, and her sister Polly is a constant problem, always making fun of her and telling her what a big baby she always is. Nothing seems to be going right for her, until she meets a boy who is a great match with her. But there is still one problem left....he is her best friend's boyfriend....Read this cool book to see how things go for Samantha."
5,Great,"I read this book once while on summer vacation. When I returned home I pulled the book off the shelf and read it over again, and found out that their were parts that I missed. Total now I've read this book at least 5 times it's been just as great each time round."
2,was not what I was looking for but it was nice,"there has been a mistake, I ordered the steam spray and dry travel iron, and had to return it. I returned it because it did not get the wrinkle out plus one had to allways press a button to even get the steam going. Which was not what I was looking for. I wanted an iron that you could iron clothes while they were hanging. That is not what it did. PLUS I CALLED FOR INFO TO RETURN IT AND THE LADY SENT ME ANOTHER GARMENT STEAMER THAT I DO NOT WANT EITHER, AND WOULD LIKE TO RETURN IF I MAY AND GET MY MONEY G.BACK THANKS! ARTHUE ROSS 833 30TH ST. NW MASSILLON, OHIO 44647 AND SEEING AS I DID NOT ASK FOR THE GARMENT STEAMER IN THE FIRST PLACE I WILL NOT PAY FOR IT TO BE RETURNED, AND HOPE THAT I RECIEVE A MAILER TO RETURN IT THAT WILL NOT COST ME ANYTHIN"
5,Nordic Chill,Absolutely fantastic! If you're interested in what the Nordic music scene is like you must pick up this album.Smooth downtempo chill.Hird and Plej are my favs and since I've had this disc I've picked up a few albums by both artists and have discovered that the Swedes know how to make amazing electronic vibes.I highly recommend it!
1,Buy the widescreen VHS instead! This is terrible,"DO NOT buy this dvd, the quality is quite simply the worst Ive ever seen on dvd. The format is 4:3 fullscreen, and the picture is so blocky it looks like a chequers board! This version is also illegal, and has not been transferred with permission. My advice - stay well away from this version and wait for a good quality widescreen dvd release. This version is offensive!"
1,Read carefully...,"The average customer review is based on all versions!The film is incredible, but this (DVD) edition is appalling beyond words - the quality is about that of a pirated VHS film, a genuine VHS copy would be a much better buy.Avoid it at all costs!"
5,Zulu DVD,This is my favorite DVD. The final third of the movie is wonderful. I'm a fan of Michael Caine especially his early movies. I wish there was a soundtrack. Men of Harlech is thrilling.
1,Zulu,"The disc arrived broke, the quality of print on the cover, tells me more about the provider than the quality of disc. Quick dispatch, shame about the product"
5,Classic British (indeed Welsh) understatement,"Those who appreciate under-stated acting, under-stated heroics (in the best British tradition) and with the superb and greatly under-rated Stanley Baker, should relish this film. Those who have a fascination for Africa in general and southern Africa in particular, will yield even more pleasure. Those who rejoice in the rhythmic chanting of African warriors will feel their spines tingle. Those who have been in the British military, especially as a private soldier, will recognize that the humour they often experienced, particularly in the face of danger, has been available for a long, long time. The other revelation of course is Michael Caine's first starring role and a terrific debut it was. The Welsh dimension is quietly significant. It's a wonderful film.Ian Hunter.Author of `e-Love'."
4,Troma's Going All Classy On Us,"For a studio that subjected us to 'Maniac Nurses Find Ecstasy', Troma's release of 'Zulu' comes as a complete surprise. Zulu is my all time favorite war movie, with unforgettable battle sequences and razor-sharp suspense.It's not what you'd expect from Troma, but entertaining nonetheless."
5,Stiff Upper Lip Action Adventure,"ZULU is a good stiff upper lip British military action adventure film directed by Cy Endfield. The battle sequences and their buildup are spectacularly staged. This is a suspenseful and very moving film thanks to an outstanding cast including Stanley Baker, Michael Caine, James Booth and Nigel Green and John Barry's incredibly dynamic score."
2,Video on DVD,"The movie itself is great, but the format is standard NTSC on dvd. Making the use of dvd a waste of effort. Just like wactching regular VHS video. That is the reason for the poor rating."
2,Great movie- crappy DVD,"Zulu is arguably one of the greatest war movies ever made. Even people who don't like war movies will enjoy this movie.Unfortunately, this version of it on DVD will not play on most computer DVD players. So if you watch movies on your computer, then you are probably out of luck.MGM should be ashamed of themselves for using overly restrictive copy protection."
2,fascinating first 10 minutes,fascinating first 10 minutes but the rest is very boring.the zulu wedding ceremony dance is incredible and beautiful.the rest forget it. I would recommend this movie just for the first 10-15 minutes.
5,Very Satisfied,This was ordered as a gift and arrived on time. I am sure the recipient will enjoy it greatly! I was not able to track the purchase until 4 days after it shipped.
5,Unforgettable,"Fantastic Christmassongs, we bought the CD to substitute our gramophonerecord, which had become unusable."
5,"A ""user friendly"" introduction to the practice of hatha yoga","An Invitation To Christian Yoga provides an informed and ""user friendly"" introduction to the practice of hatha yoga as a source of spiritual well-being in a format compatible to a Christian discipline of prayer and exercises. The text is wonderfully enhanced with helpful illustrations in simple line drawings with Nancy Roth (an Episcopal priest) providing a short biblical text, often drawn from the Psalms, accompany each exercise as a basis for Christian mediation. Whether a novice beginner or an experienced yoga practitioner, An Invitation To Christian Yoga will prove invaluable, practical, inspiring reading, and is especially recommended for anyone who is recovering from an illness or insure, or is less limber than they once were due to the aging process."
2,Difficult to adjust straps,"I'm still looking for a well-fitting bra. The wide straps are more comfortable than narrow ones, but I need to shorten them more than the construction allows."
1,My Grandmother was SO wrong!,"for most of my adulthood, I've been searching for THE perfect bra to wear and after hearing my grandmother's advice for years and years to try an ""18 hour brassiere,"" I bought one last week to try it. I am so disappointed. The fit is terrible and not true to size (incredibly small) and the fabric is a scratchy mess. I had bulges coming out in places I never knew I had. I did wear the bra for several hours, hoping that it would maybe relax a bit, but after four hours, the straps just dug into my shoulders causing more uncomfortableness. I really wanted to like this bra, but I can't. I would take the bra back, but because it's unsanitary to return a bra, it's getting thrown in the trash."
2,Uncomfortable,"I really wanted to like this bra as it is very pretty. However, it was extremely scratchy and irritated my skin in several places. I did not like the cone look! I felt I looked ridiculous. I am big busted so this bra will probably work for those who are smaller. It's just not for me."
5,Great Bra!!!!,This is the real deal. I have several and I am never disapointed.... also shipped right on time!I will always buy from this dealer.
3,"great bra,","The item was okey however, i didn't like the smell that was coming out of the box and i didn't feel alright knowing that the item inside wasn't in plastic."
3,not happy,"it took way too long to get here, will probably not use this company again the item was a little small"
2,Ok but way too big and no support,"The were huge and no support. Probably good for people that do not have huge watermelon boobs. lol, but seriously."
5,Great Bra for the money,"Great bra for the money and very durable. I gave it 4 stars because the comfort straps need to be improved. The straps tend to be sharp in certain areas, making it uncomfortable and even a bit painful. I do have very large breast so I know that makes it worst. Overall I do recommend. For smaller breast it may be perfect."
2,Not for me,"Made my boobs look pointy and the material was itchy. I did like the comfort straps, hopefully I can find that feature in a different bra that works for me."
2,Just Horrible,These are very thin and unlined in the cup area as well as very scratchy. They also create a very unattractive cone shape once you try to put a shirt over the bra. They are not at all what I expected. :( I’m not sure why they took so much time to make the straps padded and comfortable (which ARE pretty nice - which is why this product is getting two stars from me instead of one) when the cups are like wearing burlap on your breasts.
5,"Great Bra, Great Price","I love Playtex bras to begin with. Even though I have a large chest, I have not experienced any discomfort. Time will tell to see how well the bra holds up as they sometimes stretch too much amd this particular one is a new style for me, so there are some unknowns. Would hate to be too droopy at my age!"
2,typical shoddy Sennett,"Nothing about Langdon's individuality can save these films from being typical low-budget, slipshod Sennett productions. The accompanying scores are dreadful and just make viewing that much more of a chore. I'm beginning to think that 'The Strong Man' was the aberration - the more I see of Langdon the less I feel he deserves any sense of equality with Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd. I applaud Allday for creating this set so that all can judge Langdon for themselves - but if you're listening at Allday, please give me something less avant-garde musically on your next silent project."
5,"Langdon, at long last!","I was hoping that more of Harry Langdon's films would come to be seen (after fearing that time & neglect had ruined most of his work). Kino Video has already released his three hugely successful feature films (the ones which built his reputation as a serious rival to Chaplin, Keaton & Lloyd). But his shorts with Sennett have never been spotlighted until now.While Langdon's success is partly owed to prodigies such as Frank Capra, there's no doubt that Langdon himself was these film's genuine treasure, using his comic timing & pantomimic skills to make them special.I'll be anxiously awaiting the release of this DVD package along with many others who want to see more of this neglected silent film clown."
1,Color is terrible!!!!!!!!,I bought three of these printers and had the same problem with all three. After about 6 months to a year the color went bad. Since I had all these expensive toner cartridges I bought another printer- same model. And the color went bad. So I did the same thing again- and again the color went bad. I now have 3 network printers that will print in black and white- but not in color. These printers are horrible. If I could make it less than 1 star I would.
2,HP 2600n,"This printer is a primary network printer. It has issues when connected directly to one PC. If using Windows Vista, a Printer Spooler Error occurs. HP has no supporting drivers to fix this. Microsoft has no Windows patches to fix this. This error is famous as several forums exist to attempt and hack both the Windows spooler and the HP 2600n. Fought this problem for two solid days with Tech calls, internet chats and promises of return calls with a solution. I have yet to hear from either group. However, the pages that managed to print were of the finest quality I've ever seen from a home office printer. I'm sure it will be the best printer I'll ever own once it works."
2,USB interface killed Ethernet port,"I migh have a defective printer but this is what I encountered. I want 2 computers to share this printer. I connected one PC via the Ethernet port, everything printed good. I than connected second PC on the USB port, everthing worked great. But the first PC can no longer print to the printer on the Ethernet port. The printer didn't even appear on the DHCP list. It just seem using the USB port would disable the Ethernet port forgood. Emailed to HP about this, no reply yet. Has anyone else had this problem?"
3,No Problems... but...the cost of cartridges!!,"I have two of these: One at work, one at home. I've had both for well over a year and a half. Mechanically, and functionally, they have performed great. In fact, I would say that you can't get much better value for what the printer delivers. It has consistently produced some fairly decent quality documents.However........the cost of the toner cartridges is pretty astounding. I don't think there's much variance between different manufacturers for this, but, you easily pay more for the ink than you do for the printer. My recommendation would be, if you're in the market for a COLOR laser printer, by all means look at the quality of output, speed, etc... but, be sure to factor in the cost of the toner cartridges for that particular printer."
3,Average,"This machine prints great. Takes a while to initialize and does it quite often, so best if you leave it on all the time. Also had a problem with it thinking that it was out of the yellow ink. It was not. Took me skaking the cartridge and taking them all out and placing them back a few times to correct the error. But, otherwise this item is acceptable especially for the price. The ink....expensive. Look to see the ink prices before making this choice."
3,small size = smaller toners,"Do the math, folks: this printer comes with 2,000 page toner cartridges and runs around three to four hundred bucks. Each toner cartridge (there are 4) costs around eighty bucks so by the time you use 4,000 pages you've added a whopping three hundred fifty bucks (with tax) to the price.I did some research and found a Dell 3100cn laser for three hundred direct from Dell, which costs about the same and comes with full toners for a whopping 4,000 pages!!!The HP printer is smaller and prettier, though its print quality is not quite as good. Its color output is slightly faster but its black and white output is super slow in comparison. But bottom line is that 4,000 pages and another set of toners later, I would've had to pay TWICE as much as the Dell.Needless to say, I made a beeline to Dell's website. Got the 3100cn for only three hundred clams with shipping, in fact. Shweeeeeeet!"
2,"Decent Printer I guess, but leaky cartridges","This is not a ""low use"" type of printer. I found out that when not doing alot of printing jobs and letting the printer sit over time, the color toner cartridges will start to leak, which causes nice vertical lines on your print jobs. The only solution is to buy new cartridges, which at 80 per, isn't exactly easy to do.Also the networking ability is junk. I'm sure it's much better when directly connected, but the software finding this printer is spotty at best.I believe this printer when used in a higher use environment will probably do well, the print quality is wonderful (except for pictures, but who would try to print pictures on a color $500 laser and expect picture quality?). But for home use, this leaky cartridge thing has me looking for another computer. Luckily I can buy a new Samsung CLP 315 for less than new cartridges for this printer, and the CLP has wireless ability!"
3,"Good price, but sucks down the ink","Laser printers usually use little ink. There is a reason the printer is inexpensive.If you print volume, in the long run, you are better off spending more and getting one that uses less ink"
2,Poor paper handling,"I've just had to return this printer due to its constant failure to feed paper correctly. The paper either fails to feed up from the tray or jams half-way through printing. This was already a replacement printer for another with similar problems so I think it's either a design flaw or a bad batch. The type of paper doesn't make a difference - light grade through heavy presentation types all jam in exactly the same way.On the plus side, when it does print the quality is outstanding. I may have just been unlucky twice in a row, but the mechanical problems mean that I can't recommend this printer."
4,the green method.....,"I have been slowing switching all of my families cleaning products over to Method products. They clean well, have nice, fresh scents instead of choke worthy chemical scents in most ""toxic"" cleaners, and come in very mod, clean line, eco friendly packaging. Method has made it easy being green.I gave sweet water a 4 instead of 5 because it was a little too ""flowerey"" for me, but you may like it. Please remember to either recycle or reuse the bottle. Like the other reviewer, I've reused the foaming bottle by putting about 1/8 to 1/4 of method dish soap and the rest of the bottle with water (fill slowly so you won't make it foam out of the bottle.)4 stars!"
4,"""Don't matter who you are, THAT'S funny...""","I pull this vid out whenever I need a lift...it is a guarantee that I will be laughing out loud. One of the best things about it is the time they spend together on stage after all the sets are done, just telling stories. And Larry the Cable Guy at Victoria's Secret just hurts."
