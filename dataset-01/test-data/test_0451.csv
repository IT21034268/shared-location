1,"This is not a CHI, product is counterfeited","I can't believe my surprise when after two months of using this item and wondering why it performed so well the CHI label faded away, that's correct it faded.This company is counterfeiting CHI products, something must be done!I have contacted them several times and no response, Amazon protection program has not responded either. What must a consumer do to get their claims answered?"
2,not for african american natural hair,i brought this product awhile ago finally used it and it barely straightens my hair....i should have returned it along time ago...it also pulls your hair out...it didn't seem that hot to me
2,USED!,"I ordered 2 Chi straighteners from this website, and they originally only sent one. I had to email them again to have the second one sent. Although the product was listed as ""new,"" it is obvious that both straighteners were previously used. (They didn't even come in a full Chi box). The straighteners work just fine, but don't be fooled-these are not brand new."
3,"Not the right one for my hair, good price however","I bought it for the name but not impressed with it's performance. Maybe it is too small, I have long hair. Would not buy this if you have long, thin hair."
4,Good Value,Condition of book (used) was very accurate. Overall a very good reference for my wife who is an artist and needs images of cats by specific breed.
3,Written for Young Folks,"This books is a decent effort by a first time writer to give a good account of the adventures of Hugh Glass, an American mountain man who has been woefully neglected by history. Unfortunately the writer often repeats facts to a point where the adult reader would throw the book across the room.Because Hugh's greatest adventure (his lone survival after being attacked by a mother grizzly and abandoned by his comrades) is one of hatred and revenge, the author focuses primarily on his life as a captive and reluctant pirate under the command of Jean Lafitte, and his life with the Pawnee.I mistakenly believed this was a novel for an adult so I ordered it. If I were a ten or twelve year old boy I would have enjoyed it immensely. The book tends to be well researched with few historical errors so it could be used to make American history a bit more interesting to children who live in front of home video games."
3,"Elmo's World- Babies, Dogs & More",My 11 month old son loves Elmo's World I just wish that they would put on the product information what stories are included because I also bought Elmo's World Pets and the Dogs and Cats part was also on there as I have found that alot of these discs do put the same stories on other discs. Overall we are statified.
4,"a little two ""real""","A very cool cop show- but as typical of all these shows- they always get their man, and the rookies (not really rookies in the second season)save the day. All in all an addicting show- but being based out of Canada how come none of the cops say ""eh""?"
2,No response to email of damaged product.,I bought a seasoned DVD from this user and obtained it pretty quick. However some of the discs were damaged and it skipped episodes. I reached out to this user by email but to no evail. I will not be using this person again because I there is a problem you get no response
5,Rookie Blue Fan,"I really enjoy this show and can't wait for next season. I really like the player and the story line for each week. Wonder if I would be able to be in their shoes, I know it is a tv show and watch it every week."
3,Not up to expectations,"This DVD would probably be OK for most, but I found it somewhat lacking in originality. The first season offered mostly fresh and interesting material but in this season, I found many episodes repeating portions, or at least very similar to some from the first season."
2,For small bones...,"Got this to replace the rusty trusty generic pliers I use to pull bones from larger fish like salmon, sea bass...the contact point on the tweezers where they meet the bone is flat and not grooved. So a bone that's anchored in a fish slides right through, even with decent pressure on the tweezers. After a few tries, I had brought the pliers back into the kitchen again.I had seen several recommendations suggesting fish pliers such as the Messermeisters over tweezers, I guess I'll try that route now."
4,A good read!,"At good read that is both funny and at times frightening, Horwitz doesn't seem to pad much with his descriptions of his travels which makes it quite real (and also quite enjoyable). I highly recommend this book which gives a pretty good look into parts of the middle east."
2,Thunderbird U.,"Thunderbird - the American Graduate School of International Management, is where these two guys graduated from with M.B.A.s. Isn't thunderbird that stuff that winos drink? Someone must of been drunk on thunderbird when they did the illustrations for this punishing piece of literature. When I say punishing, I'm not kidding. Illustrations are in the wrong place and off the wall sentences appear out of nowhere. The editor for this book must have fallen asleep while he was editing it. I have to agree w/ Sharky's statement, ""In Depth"" my eye."
4,very good,"If I can figure out how to use it, anyone can! On one long trip, and a few short ones, it has been perfect. The battery lasts about three hours, if it lasted longer, I would give it five stars, because then I could use it on motorcycle trips also."
2,Updater Doesn't Work,"When I took the SD card out and tried to update it... nothing happened. Long story short, the maps on the SD card got erased and I couldn't figure out how to get them back. I contacted Calibar but they replied with confusing directions and I had to get ready for a trip to New England with lots of twisting roads. I returned this to Amazon and went to Best Buy to buy a Garmin. The Garmin works great."
3,Braille lable tape,This clear tape is perfect for the Braille labler. The Braille is easy to read and the clear color lets the print still be read by sighted folks.
5,finger paint,I have not used this product as it is a Christmas present. It is exactly what I ordered and is a great value.
2,No Real HD Photography - All CGI,"If I would have known that this was not real NASA HD photography and fake CGI, I would not have bought this Blue Ray. It's not even good CGI, as it is extremely grainy on a 1080p HD TV. It looks even worse than 480i on a conventional TV. This video is just a screensaver basically, and not a good, clear one at that. I would not reccommend it unless you like to waste your money on really BAD CG!"
2,Neat the First Time Through,"As far as novelty recordings go, its good fun. But Zevon's lyrics carried most of these songs the first time around, and some just don't hold up well as instrumentals. Roland just seems to trug along for an eternity.That said, the quartet really does hit on I was in the House When the House Burned Down. Buy it if your a huge fan looking for a novelty record."
3,the jury is out,"i am a HUGE wz fan and have been since i first saw him live in boston circa 1980. i agree with some of the other comments. no lyrics means that you've lost more than half the power of zevon. however, i'm delighted that someone out there respects his songs so much as to put out a tribute record. but what i would really like to see (hear) is a tribute record performed by singer/songwriters, such as bob dylan, tom waits, elvis costello, or even eugene chadbourne, the residents or randy newman. now that would be fun !!!and i still want 'the envoy' and 'stand in the fire' to be released on CD. get with it already !!!"
4,Great for trimming,My beautician uses this trimmer and recommended to me. I like how well it cuts and is lightweight. My boys have thick hair and sometimes the Peanut has a little trouble getting through it. So think it's best for trims. My oldest son likes to use the guard and trim his beard with it. Good product.
1,Shocking,"Developed a short in it after 2 months. I would receive a shock when I plugged it in before I turned it on. Also, as another user said, as a beard trimmer, it is difficult to fully remove the hairs from the blades."
3,trimmer is loud,"Purchased timmer because of it size. Thinking it would be lighter and easier to use. It is much lighter and it is easy to use, however, it is loud. it also has a smaller cutting width, which isn't a big deal but buyers should know what they are getting. It does cut very well, but the 4 combs it comes with may not be enough. They do not go large enough for our cutting preference. Just my thoughts on it. Over all a good buy."
4,Great Clippers!,These Clippers are Great! Tons of power packed in a little compact casing. They are great for everyday use and/or travel. They are so gentle you could use them on toddlers!
5,Best hair cut ever.,Easy to grip and different attachment for whatever length hair cut you want. Have cordless and wired. Both are great.
3,Not the best but helpful!,"if you have a straight razor or shavette like a barber razor this is the one your looking for because you can always define the line with the razor, but if you don't have one and for a decent barber razor or shavette which ever you call it, you'll probably be looking at another 10 to 20 dollars so i'll suggest one of the andis t outliner or the outliner 2 which if adjusted right can help you get better line ups or use it to shape up your beard"
4,Happy so far.,"After reading all the other reviews I decided to try this clipper. I have now used it twice, and can say I like the product. It is a bit small to be a stand alone clipper. Plus there needs to be one or two guards that are longer than the #4. In my opinion it works great for touch up work. It is easier to handle than the larger clippers I have tried. I have used it alone to cut my hair, but I will need to buy another clipper with a longer guard for my winter haircut."
4,Corded trimmer...,"This trimmer is very good for face and feet, but is does have a tendency to burn if you are not careful. That is not a problem with the trimmer, but a problem with the user."
4,Powerful and easy to use,"Amazing how much power can be packed into a small package. Very easy to get used to. Results are excellent. After years of using dinky shaver attached trimmers, my first attempts cut too deep as I was unprepared for how much strength this thing packs. Highly recommend. Just be careful at first."
4,"Slim volume, excellent pictures","As far as contemporary pictures goes, this book is fabulous. It shows costumes from diverse times and regions, and even mentions the Festival dancers, etc., and not just An Coimisuin (excuse my spelling if it is incorrect). As I mentioned in the title, the pages are few, but the size of the book is reflected in its price (LOW!). The content in terms of text is ok; nothing was obviously inaccurate (unlike the arthur flynn ID book), and, even though the volume is brief, the text is fairly comprehensive."
4,Highly Recommended,"I purchased a Litter Robot 2 and absolutely love it. I have a very messy cat and was afraid he would somehow miss the container. He has not so far. The motor is a little loud, but not so bad I would consider sending it back. Overall I consider this a great purchase. There is an adjustable sensor on the bottom up front that allows you to adjust the sensitivity. I had to make it more sensitive on the carpet and less sensitive on a hard wood floor.Pros: Automatically sifts litter after each use. Uses regular clumping litter. Low ongoing cost. Deposits the clumps in a waste basket underneath. Adjutable sensitivity to allow for different cat sizes and different surfaces.Cons: High up front cost. Somewhat loud. Sometimes clumps of litter stick to the floor initially."
3,Needs some tweaking...,"Overall, the LitterRobot does as it claims.Pros: Saves you time in scopping and cuts down on odor.Cons: No matter how often you clean out the globe, the cat's mess gets stuck to the top of the globe when it rotates. I'm not happy about my cat's head rubbing against mess that sticks to the inside top of the globe. Also, about once a month, he forgets to turn around with his head sticking out, and does his business on the steps. For an additional $20 you can buy 2 things that ""help"" seal out the odor even more. This didn't appear to help with mine. Every 5 days I need to change the bag. If the cat's turd is too big, it can cause the ""window"" that opens to jam. This will cause the mess to smear on the outside. I thoroughly cleaned the globe 2 days ago, and although not as bad as a regular box, I can still smell it! Ugh! It needs some tweaking."
1,Horrible waste of money!,"I purchased this because I had read some good reviews. My experience was horrible. We received it, put it together, and it NEVER ONCE worked. Customer service was very quick to respond with trouble-shooting tips, but none of them worked. Now we have to ship it back at our expense - and it is costing me an arm and a leg to ship back. Basically I spent a fortune to have something NEVER work! I would have been better off never purchasing this in the first place. The company should pay for return shipping if the item never worked. It's not like my cats ruined it - they never even got a chance to try it out. WASTE OF MONEY!"
3,Mediocre,"I waited for this litter box to come so much!We have six cats and we have to leave them for up to a week once in a while. We have a Scoop Free automatic litter box, but cartridges are expensive, and I use it only when I am away to ease life of a ""visiting mom"".So I bought Litter Robot for everyday use and in addition to Scoop Free. The idea is great and it works well. I want to mention the two shortcomings, which I have not seen mentioned before: cheap, very smelly plastic litter underlay and small cabin size.My cats are Siberians, smaller then Main Coons, but still are big fluffy buddies. I filled Litter Robot with Kitten Attract litter, which my cats would not miss for anything. They use Litter Robot occasionally, but not nearly as much as they would use a normal litter box filled with Kitten Attract. Also the plastic can be a source of bad phenol-like chemicals in your house.I do not mind buying the Litter Robot. If nothing else, its movement definitely attracts a lot of attention :)"
2,Worked well for a short time,"I bought one of these and it worked really well, doing what it said it would do for a short time. Then the sensor stopped working and the only way to get it to spin was to unplug it and plug it back in... making it useless. Add to that that one of our cats refused to use it... again making it useless. A huge waste of money. I suggest looking into the Tidy Cats Breeze Litter System. The most amazing litter box I've ever used... I would highly recommend it."
1,Great FOR a SHORT SHORT period of TIME,"When I first got the product it worked like a dream! Then I began to notice that it would not go through the cleaning cycles like it had when first put to use. Then the lights started to blink, then it would cycle only if you unplugged-plugged it back in and held the button down... All this led to a non-functioning 299.00 litter box that is a pain in the tail to clean out (manually). I have left messages for the ""Customer Service dept"" but no calls back.!! What really angers me is that I initially spoke so highly of the product two of my close friends purchased the same product. At this time I would recommend you not buy this product on-line, MAYBE at a local pet store etc that you can easily return it too if there are problems. I no longer have the GIGANTIC box the product came in nor the shipping papers so I do not see how I can possibly return the item. VERY VERY disappointed!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Naked Men by David Leddick,"This book is fascinating if macabre. Seeing these one-time beauties, after age has ravaged them for forty years, is a humbling experience. However, do not confuse this author's writing with scholarship. I counted over 25 factual errors in the first 10 pages of his essay. Also, the selection of photographs is often poor. Better nude images exist for many of the models featured in this book."
1,Very Disappointed Concert,- Poor Video and music Quality. I'm very fond of the Latin Music and above all LIVE CONCERTS but this one was the Worst concert I have ever bought so far. I wish I could have refund for this buying. If you have the Marc Anthony concert at Madison Square Garden DO NOT BOTHER in buying this one. This has the same songs but with POOR Video and SOUND quality!!!
5,A Nightly Must-Read Book For My Home,"I have been reading this book to my 3.5 year old for well over a year. We love the rhymes and all the different types of hugs. Her favorite is a ""tickle hug,"" which I am happy to give to her upon request. I am surprised that there have not been that many reviews. I recommend this book to everyone that has a toddler!"
5,Great music,"This music is wonderful, as it is with all Lawrence Welk's music. I'll have nice times listening to it. Thanks"
4,Fate,In my opinion I do not see why this movie has gotten such a bad rating for.Although I did not like the nudity. That is the only bad thing i can say about this movie. Michael Pare' whom I adore was great in this .HE is a superb actor.THe story plot wwas good.Lee Majors and Philip Michael Thomas also did a good acting job. me for one really liked this.
3,You Decide,"I'm going to sit right in the middle of the fence on this one. I rather like Number 17 despite its all-too-apparent flaws. It's one of Hitch's least leisurely films, running only an hour and three minutes. The train/bus chase is wonderfully imagined, if you can get past the obvious model work. The characters ARE hard to keep track of -- none are particularly engaging -- yet you find yourself rather quickly engaged by them and the truly silly, convoluted plot.Unfortunately, Laserlight hasn't bothered with any restoration work, and the print is pretty awful on the DVD. The most that can be said is that it's not as bad as most of the Madacy prints and that, with the addition of the silent feature, The Ring, the DVD is a true value for the Hitchcock collector. And on that topic, The Ring has values of its own, including impressive performances by Carl Brisson and Ian Hunter. Sadly, Lilian Hall-Davis's heroine is mostly trashy and unattractive."
4,Really good book !,"Don't hesitate to buy this book, especially those who want to understand more about sports nutrition without any medical background. Discribe everything very clear and I think I found every information I need in this book. Can't wait to purchase the new edition when they're out."
2,I discontinued use,This product did not reduce the number of flats during my 40 mile daily commute. I have not figured out why. I discontinued using them because replacing my tubes became a minor hassle. I usually inspect my tire for a thorn or nail so using this product forces me to remove the liner for this interior tire inspection. I think a better tube or a better tire would be superior to using this product.July 2012 Update: I was right about getting a better tire. I went with Kenda Kourier K-Shield Bicycle Tire which has a shield built into the tire. I have yet to have a flat after 1 year of commuting to work about 20 miles day. I just love this tire for this reason.
3,Not the best Gevalia has to offer.,"Unfortunately, I have to say that the flavoring added to this coffee to make it ""chocolate raspberry"" was subpar.While I'm a fan of Gevalia coffees in general, this was not their best effort. Maybe suitable for a dessert coffee; but, serve it with a plain shortbread, if anything.Try the amaretto or Irish creme instead!"
4,Pricey for an ebook version.,"Surprisingly anticlimactic for a RM novel. Still a good read, but 10 bucks is steep for the ebook version I think. Save your money."
5,Best book for Unix newbie,"When I bought this book, I didn't realize the value of book.After I finished reading, it was amazing!I learned everything I need to know for using Unix/Linux system.Easy to understand and easy to follow examples.Just buy it and read it all!"
4,Excellent Beginner's Book for Unix,"Dave Taylor does an excellent job of presenting Unix to the beginner. My company used this book to train about 20 of us in beginning Unix. The hands on training and do by example while you are reading through the book is invaluable for learning. Also, Dave provides his website and responds promptly to emails send to him. I was impressed that an author would respond to my email in less than 24 hours."
1,Do Not Buy if your a beginner!,I purchased this book based upon the reviews provided. In my current job I use Unix in a very basic way. I wanted to purchase a book to give me a better understanding of the commands I was using. This book fails in every way.The building block concept the book claims to implement is a joke. The author directs you to enter in commands but does not explain why he is doing so. Concepts from future hours are utilized early (don't worry the author says we will go over it later). Key concepts are dismissed in one sentence (see echo). So many commands are thrown at you that it becomes difficult to keep track of them. Exercises at the end of the book do not come with answers at the end.If your a user with a good working knowledge of Unix then you might find this book useful. Otherwise do NOT buy. You'd be better using google to get your Unix expertise.
5,Great insight to a lesser known Kennedy,"I have always been facsinated by the Kennedy's, but Kathleen has been my favorite. Probably because she was such a strong presence. She risked losing her family for love, she lived in such beautiful places and during a romantic time period.I wanted to know more about her, but could never find much past her marriage and then her doomed relationship with Fitzwilliam.I was thrilled to find this book and learn more about he education and later her job as a would be journalist. To think about what she would've become had she lived a full life.Very interesting and I came away with new insights into her life.Sarah J. Boyer"
2,So slow.,I like the fact that the drive is password protected and was very easy to setup a new password.But this is the slowest flash drive I have ever used. A write operation of 300 MB that on my cruiser or HP flash drive completes usually within 5 to 10 minutes takes close to 4 hours on this one.Will not buy again.
1,Trashy Product,The item broke today in my pocket. Do not waste your money. How difficult is it really to make a flash drive that goes on a key ring and does not break (the drive was not dropped & it was in my pocket)??? Do not buy this junk.
3,A good guide but too much information....,"This is a good guide for the beginning watercolor artist...but I hesitate to give it more than 3 stars, simply because there is too much information and it is a tad overwhelming.The book is divided into:MaterialsTechniquesColorLanscapesStill LifeThere is adequate information as to appropriate tools and there is good information on color and brushmarks. However, there is too little instruction and the instruction that is given, is not always clear. I think I would have enjoyed the book more if there was less information on some of the more advanced techniques and more instruction on the basics. I also felt that the format of the book could have been better- there seems to be simply too much squeezed onto each page.However, I'd still recommend this to anyone interested in watercolor though I'd suggest checking it out of your local library as opposed to purchasing it."
4,Very good for the price,"We needed an easel for work and this one fit the bill. It allows us to use easel paper and if we run out, the dry erase board looks well.Its construction is the one area that I think could be improved. It's not as stable as I'd like and the fact that the rear leg is just cantilevered out and held in place by the small plastic hinge mechanism makes me worry that it might get broken. I would have liked to have seen a chain and/or collapsing piece of metal that stopped the rear leg from spreading out rather than the hinge, but it hasn't been a problem yet. (I'll try to updating in a few months to see whether or not it has been a problem.)"
1,Don't waste time or money on this dud,"A 30 page novel, compressed into 453 pages of tedious, slow moving, irrelevant drivel. After 250 pages it began to move a little. After the first 200 or so pages, I began to skim the rest and really never missed a thing. The conclusion is really never in doubt. I only had to wade through randomly generated words for confirmation of what was expected all along. When I finished it, it was a relief. I could throw the book away and get to something interesting.If you liked SSN you may like this.Oh yes, the ending is a set up for a sequel. No thanks."
3,Good on most fronts-except the title,"I purchased this dvd alongside the Neena and Veena ""Basic Dance"" dvd, to help get me started. This is most certainly NOT a teaching dvd. If you are a new beginner (such as myself), this is not the disk for you. If you're an experienced dancer (read ""intermediate""), who wants to learn a new dance, fine.In short, you're better off finding a different instructional dvd until you can keep up with her. Sorry Rania."
3,Good Sword and Sandal!,"I just received ""Atlas"" in the mail and watched it for the first time in forty years. I saw only about twenty minutes of it on television, then the station went out for a couple of hours. It has taken all these years to finally see the end of it! For a low-budget sword and sandal movie, it has to rank high in comparison with its counterparts. It is good to see an English-speaking sword and sandal flick with a decent plot and realistic scenery. Michael Forest does a very good job as Atlas and does an especially fine job wrestling. Many films of this genre advertise wrestling matches, but end up in a pro wrestling skit with feigned blows. Atlas and his opponents actually show off good wrestling moves. The major downfall of the movie is the warring sequences; it is hard to have convincing warfare between nations when you never see the nations! Other than that, this is a good movie!"
2,good idea gone bad,tried to adjust air pressure in tube and the slime sealed the valve stem. 15 16 17 18 19 20
5,The best Schrader valve Tube,"Great tube for hostile glass and thorn ridden trails. You will have very few flats when you use this. You can also put slime into regular tubes, but this makes it easy."
1,Not much better than a regular tube.,"I bought these tubes expecting them to be better than regular tubes, and a little more resistant to losing air. I was wrong. Rode my bike regularly for awhile, then a small thorn punctured the tire. The slime did virtually nothing to stop the leak, so i went and bought a patch kit from a hardware store. The patch kit works wonderfully! Makes me wish i had just bought those originally instead of the slime tubes."
3,"Ordered two, received one defective.","Ordered two of these along with tires to upgrade my girl's bicycle so that we can go riding with friends, but when i received them, one tube was defective, the valve did not hold the air. Amazon replacement was easy, but that did not help the fact that we had to cancel our ride until the replacement arrived 2 days later. Once the second tube arrive, i installed the tires and its been working great since."
4,It works,"Great tube. Need to make sure you fit it in right. The slime isn't fun if you need to take the tube out. No matter how you do it, the slime will come out and gum up the tube if you have to let air out to reseat the tube. Its a fill once and ride tube. No leaks so far."
3,"first one popped, second one good",The first one popped as soon as I pumped it up to 60. Amazon was awesome about sending out a replacement one quickly. The second one is holding up great. Had no issues with it. Can't beat the price.
4,Surprised,"i was kind of surprised by the movie, wasn't thrilled with it, but the seller was great and true to his word...it wasn't his fault i wasn't hooked on the movie, my bag...but still would do future purchases thru them..."
2,Gorgeous but unwearable,"These are beautiful shoes. They have great arch support. I wish I could wear them. The top of the heel grinds into the back of your heel under the ankle, and the sole under the toes and front of the foot is paper-thin. Insoles didn't help. Heel guards didn't help. I haven't yet taken them to a shoe repair store to see if anything else can be done. Realize that these are DANCE shoes and not everyday shoes. (My niece who is a dancer tells me all Capezios dig into the back of your heel.) If you don't need these for professional dancing, don't buy them."
2,2 Dog Night,"How disappointing, without all three lead vocals, this is not Three Dog Night. Anyone who thinks this is a 5 star CD is either tone deaf, or is completely ignorant about TDN. First, with all that symphony, it's not Rock n' Roll anymore, and w/o Chuck Negron, the true voice of ""Joy To The World"", ""Easy To Be Hard"", ""One"", ""Old Fashioned Love Song"" and others, it' is NOT Three Dog Night. Someone else singing Chicks part, is that what you'll settle for, Two Dog Night plus a non Dog?"
5,Three Dog Night - Live w/the TN Symphony Orchestra,"This is such a great DVD. Any ""baby boomer"" will love it and then younger generations as well. What a great group. Great seller to deal with. Prompt communication, fast shipping and reasonable price."
4,Could be better with Chuck Negron,"Overall, it is a good DVD, excellent sound quality. Three Dog Night without Chuck Negron still performs well. The DVD includes most of their hits, even though many of the originals were sang by Chuck. Many of their classics, like Easy To Be Hard, One, and Old Fashion Love Song, bring back memories of the good old days. Baby boomers grew up in the 60s and 70s will enjoy this DVD. Afterall, Three Dog Night was one of the most influencial groups during that era. Hope there will be a DVD coming out with all three original members performing."
1,"Excuse me...This is, at best, One Third Dog Night.","Chuck Negron was the voice most people would remember as the voice of the TDN hits, and he isn't here. He sang "" Joy To The World "", "" Eli's Coming "", "" One "", Easy To Be Hard "" and many of the other songs people remember them for. Neither Cory Wells nor Danny Hutton have his ballsy tenor and it shows, if you love the original songs. Hopefully, the original band will appear on a DVD, as they were, filmed back in the day. The chances that the original trio will ever appear together are pretty much non-existent. I call this band ""One Third Dog Night "" because Negron did most of the vocal heavy lifting; far more than his 1/3 share, and these guys were basically his backup singers. This is a weak brew for those of us who remember TDN as they were."
2,Too easy and disjointed,"This is one of the worst exercise dvds that I own. I like Tanja as an instructor, but all of her workouts are way too easy and only for beginners. This dvd was way too disjointed because all the segments are really short, such as two exercises per workout on some segments. My heart rate never went up and I just felt it was a waste of time. If you really are new to exercise this might actually be a really good start and I do recommend it for beginners."
4,"Sweeping, invigorating polemic","This book is a bit rough, sometimes cryptic, but brisk and opinionated and very very interesting. Rice identifies the distinctive feature of Western art as the celebration of the human form, and dashes through Western art since the renaissance to illustrate his point. The first and last chapters underline the main thesis, that this the main current of Western art has in modern times been abandoned, to the detriment of great art. This is not simpleminded conservatism; it is erudite and intelligent and thought-provoking. It's short, too, easy to read, lots of illustrations ... and yet has more to say than many 1000 page art history tomes. Try it!"
5,Love Nadia Ali,I LOVE Poetica... Nadia Ali is so talented and her voice is phenomenal... This is a must have!
2,"Sorry, this is weak.","I first heard Nadia Ali on a few tracks from Global Underground 29 - Sharam/Dubai (which I seriously recommend) which immediately made her my new favorite singer - so I bought this with great expectations, only to be really dissapointed. I can't imagine why she's working with this guy - sorry, he's a hack - these tracks sound like leftovers from Kylie Minogue's trash, and yes, I could do better. Avoid this at all costs & hope Nadia finds somebody with talent to work with ... yawn."
4,It's about timethey released this CD !!,After releasing wht seems like 100 singles thye finally put this CD out. It'sok but the songs seem to drag at some points in the production. It doesn't flow like it should. I do liek alot of the songs however I also think it drags at alot of points. It's Ok though
4,Girafffe,We have our giraffe hanging from the car seat. I really like all the different colors and patterns. Can't wait for my baby to start enjoying it.
3,Doesn't hold baby's attention,"Stretch the Giraffe is definitely nice. He doesn't, however, hold my 5 month old daughter's attention for very long. By far her favorite is Freddie the Firefly. She's had it since she was 3.5 months old and has played with it consistently almost every day since. I also recently bought her Princess Sophie which is super cute and she likes that one too."
2,I heard you the first time,"Decent if not particularly original characters and a well used plot but an over kill of a message. I would have liked this book better if the author had lightened up on his anti religious diatribe. I'm not particularly religious but I got tired of the same message being repeated over and over again in the story. Mr Modesitt made his point quite nicely early on in the story. His continual repeating of it throughout the story left me wondering if he had written the book to entertain or to send a message. I ended up feeling somewhat insulted, it was as if he thought I was too simple to get his point the first time he presented it and I needed to be told a few dozen more times before I would grasp it. I would have preferred a book with more plot and less preaching."
4,damnation alley,"Well my opinon is that this movie is by far the best sci-fi i know of i enjoyed it ememsley,the only trouble i had was that the cockcroaches killed one of the stars!!Ithink though it made it more exciting,there was alot of adventure and danger along there long journey!i mean have to think can this really happen,i say yes because who know who will drop the next bomb?When it came out in 1977 i was a little thing not much older then 3,but i happened to see it about 8 years old i watch from my room as my father had it on ,he told me time for bed ,but even at this age i was intriged by sci-fi and horror movies i couldn't take my eyes away from the screen!!it's a great movie and i think sci-fi fanatics like me should get every chance to see it!!Thank you james r jumper"
5,little slices of pop heaven...,"Vocalist Hilde Drange sounds like a cross between Petula Clark and Bjork (If she could sing). Her delightful voice trips thru swirling nu-jazz arrangements as electronic flourishes flesh out these little slices of pop heaven. Fresh, young, crisp and new is how it all sounds in the end....."
5,Great for my business.,I do taxes out of my home office. I buy these every year for tax season. I like them a lot better than the standard tax folder. And they are a lot cheaper. I use a dymo printer to label fronts. I will continue to order these as long as they are available. Various other colors.
2,Don't buy the black!,The black look like some gray funky tye-dye crap. I purchased these for a business and they are not professional. I couldn't have spend the same amount of money for better stuff at walmart. What a waste. So unhappy with this purchase.
4,long way from chicago,bassist willie kent from chicago is finally getting his due respect winning wc handy awards for best bassist. umptempo good time blues fill the grooves of this cd. with guest such as chico banks and james wheeler playing guitars to piano/organ player ken saydak(who plays on everyones cds) completes a great band. from the title track to the great cover of black night this cd is great
4,Not bad Not great,"Does what it is supposed to do. Face of gauge scratched from packaging, but not to the point it needed to be returned. For the money it does the job for the occasional test. Nice having the adapters for the various sized plugs"
3,"Not really 1/4""","I bought this plug cutter to plug 1/4"" holes to hide screws in picture frames. No matter what bit the hole is drilled with (I tried DeWalt and Craftsman 1/4"" bits, and a Freud 1/4"" forstner bit), the plugs cut by this tool were too small, and wobbled around in the hole. The gap was much bigger than I found acceptable (probably between 1/32 and 1/64"" all the way around). I got a different plug cutter locally, and the plugs fit perfectly in the holes I had drilled. Tight enough that I don't need any glue to hold them in place, in fact.If you don't need the plugs to cover a hole tightly, this plug cutter will work fine. It's sturdy, cuts quickly, and is easy to get plugs out of if they come loose and stick in the bit."
3,Hair grew an inch,"This product was fine and as expected... shame they don't include the last two sizes 1-1/4"" and 1-1/2"". They just took forever to get here... if I knew it would have taken so long I would have purchased at walmart or something."
3,Not bad,"Definitely not as thick as OEM mats, but the mat extends to the second row, so OK value for the amount of money spent."
3,Stick with Nintendo,"Don't believe what you read about the Prima guide being the only one with a Pokédex. Nintendo's version of the Ruby/Sapphire strategy guide includes a complete Pokédex and more information than you can imagine.Sometimes the Prima guide is better, but if you are getting a game for a Nintendo system, I'd suggest at least looking at their game guide first before even considering any other."
1,Find yourself a better guide,"Now for those of you gamers that actually like having all the information and buy a guide for that specific reason don't even consider this one. The only thing this is good for is a list of all of the pokemon. The guide skips around and you'd swear that they made up some of the information, which isn't that far fetched considering the other mistakes. Save some money, and just buy another one."
2,Not the best guide!,I think that this guide is to crowded and that makes it hard to read but this guide is helpfull and it helped me beat my game. but i did most of it without the guide and if i were you i would get the nintendo one.
4,A good guide,The only real problem with the guide is the Pokedex in the back does not give enough information.
2,Looks great to us... Baby hates it,"I am the first time mom, and don't have much experience in baby toy department. We bought this toy purely because of the reviews. This is an amazing looking toy, but my baby just hates it... It is so loud and annoying, even for us. He is scared of it so much!!!"
5,Both sides of this toy are great!,"Our daughter loved the black and white back side when she was a newborn, and now, at nearly 4 months, she is into all of the fun stuff on the colorful front side. We love this toy!"
5,Entertaining and COLORFUL!,"It wasn't until my baby was 2 months before toys started to be of interest. Freddie is definitely entertaining and helping build coordination. My baby bats at him and reacts to the different textures. For car, stroller, and tummy time, Freddie is a Must."
5,Great toy,My 3 month old daughter absolutely loves this toy. She loves the contrasting colors and patterns. It's great! Really holds her attention.
5,The Swiss Army knife of baby toys!,"I got this toy for my daughter before she was even born. We use it every single day and do not go anywhere without ""Buggy."" At 3 months, she loves to touch and grasp the crinkly wings and it is fun to dangle the teether in front of her. Somehow she is fascinated by the red color. When she was a newborn she seemed to really like it when we flipped the front of the bug (colorful) to the black and white side. We extended the reach of it by adding more links to it. You can hang it in the car or on the car seat. It's a fantastic item. We look forward to seeing her discover all the goodies this has to offer her in the coming months. I highly recommend it."
4,Lamaze character toys are the best show and play toys out there...,"This guy is now on his second kid and they both have loved the bold colors, different textures, and simple sounds and sensations. Once my son got to crawling, he lost interest - but until then he was hooked. My daughter now loves looking and feeling it, and it is easy to grasp either a wing or a ring if you simply set it next to her, although I wish it were just a little bit smaller overall so she could hold it up for herself..."
1,Boring read,This book was really boring story! The author did not make her story interesting at all. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
2,Broken when opened,I liked the large numbers which would have been great were it not broken when I opened it. Not sure if I did it or it came like that so I've ordered another.
2,Candy thermometer,"Numbers do not go low enough. I wanted to be able to see if foods are room temperture. It's ok for candy, I guess, just didn't work for me."
3,I liked it but it can be better made,"yes its the same as the picture, but really it could be better made, the cap is just the part that blew all the rest of the can."
4,Pretty Realistic,"It definitely has the look and weight of a real soda can, just not the slosh of liquid. In fact, it kind of rattled a tiny bit when I first picked it up, but stopped after I opened it and closed it again. I would suggest putting soft things like money in it because if you put jewelry and stuff in it it will definitely rattle.Otherwise, if you're just randomly moving around objects and this happens to be one of them, you'd never know it wasn't real!"
1,No Challenge,"Why the hell isn't ""The Challenge"" included in this collection? One of Frankenheimer's best movies, and it wasn't included!"
4,A Good Game,"The Quest for Glory series is the best series of computer games there is, in my opinion. Although not my favorite of the series, (QG2, Trial by Fire is), the graphics and music are really good.The big problem I found with it, as in almost all of my Sierra games, is that there are some bugs in the game and you need to download a patch to fix them. This is a shame, because otherwise Sierra would make the best games out there."
4,A Good Primer,"After a good opening salvo in the first chapter, this book slows down a bit but is none the less informative and easy to get through. good quotes, though mostly the same ones an avid golfer would have read about in Golf, Golf Digest, or Golf World. Touches on the financial implications of the Cup, sure to be of more conflict in the future as tour purses get bigger and bigger. All in all, a good primer."
2,sd card difficult to load,"I bought this SD card to use with a digital photo frame. It was recommended for purchase and seemed a good idea: Load all my pictures on a separate SD card for use with the digital frame and keep the existing SD card in my camera. However, it was extremely difficult to copy the pictures onto this card. I have no idea why this simple task was so difficult. I finally gave up after only using 300MG. What a waste for a 1 GB SD card. I wouldn't waste my money on this brand."
4,Good source,"The request for the review came weeks after the purchase. I don't remember much about the transaction other than I received the item I purchased, and it was as advertised."
5,Basic Card,"This basic memory card does just what is expected. Amazon's price wasn't the lowest on the Internet, but since it qualified for the Super Saver free shipping, it was the most economical option. The same equipment is available in retail stores, but costs as much as $10 more."
1,Worst Amazon Purchase Ever,"I've been a very happy Amazon customer but this Kingston 1GB SD card is the worst purchase I have ever made on Amazon. I purchased 4 cards and three of the four were unreadable on my MacBook Pro. I couldn't even initialize them. I thought that perhaps this was a Macintosh incompatibility issue, so I used a Windows computer. Again, I was unable to read or even initialize the card. I will never buy another Kensington product again."
5,fast shipping,I did not even expidite shipping on this item and recieved it in 3 business days. WOW !thanks for being on the ball
5,Great little card,"This card works great in my Nintendo Wii and my laptop. I have no complaints. I can't comment on the transfer speed as it is my only SD card, but for what I use it for (transferring game saves and pictures) it does the job."
4,As advertised.,I have had no problems from this SD card yet (since Christmas). It does as it says it does.
4,"Good price, good card. Too bad it's not compatible with my camera!","I can get it to work with my Gateway digital camera, but I have to format the card every time I turn my camera on. Oh well. It works great in my PDA and my husband's camera, so I use it for those."
2,Works ok but probably would try something else,"Works ok but there are a few nagging problems. Bought this product because I already have a router and wanted to drop wireless devices on my wired network. I have a toshiba laptop with a wireless G card built in and by the end of the day network throughput performance drops off by at least 50%. Tried various options and still haven't resolved. Also, the firmware for this product is not updated as often as the Wireless routers (latest is August of 2007), which makes me think this product is not used as much as the router and does not get the same level of support. Note the manual says it supports NTP but there is no NTP picks on the time menu. For the couple of months I've had this product I've had to reboot 4 times."
4,Very Nice product,It picks up well and is very lightweight and easy to use. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's rather tough and messy to clean.
5,Exactly what I hoped for,"I wanted something quick and easy to sweep up kitty litter from my carpet -- no plugs, quiet, quick, lightweight, easy to use, easy to get to. This sweeper does exactly what I wanted. It is well made, and works well. It's actually fun to use! Can't imagine not having one in my household from now on."
4,View it for the Dancing,This is a tongue-in-cheek cinderella story which contains one of the loveliest dance sequences I can remember. Anytime the two stars are on screen dancing together the film more than holds your interest. One has to wade through a ditzy plot to get to them but they are worth it.
5,"Unconventional, Campy, Cool","Unconventional, Campy, Cool really says it all.A must-see for all lovers of dance/choreography/theatre/film-making, and for those following a different drummer. ""Strictly Ballroom"" excites the senses, awakens forgotten passions. The viewer is pulled in quickly, driven to watch every moment, caring what will happen to the characters.""Strictly Ballroom"" will find its place in your top ten favorite films, without a doubt.FYI, ""Moulin Rouge"" shares the same director/producers as ""Strictly Ballroom"", although as the title might suggest, there is no vocalization in the latter."
3,Lots of Features,"I really wanted a tape player and a CD player, so this seemed like my best alternative. The CD player did not work in the first one that I received. (Only the right speakers emitted sound). The replacement seems to work fine. I like the sound quality. I like the auxillary port for my MP3 player. I do not like the bright, graphic EQ display, but I think I can find a tinted sticker to mellow it a bit. The unit also has an internal speaker, and it plays several different quirky little noises each time that you push a control button. I will probably put a piece of tape over that speaker to make the noises more subtle. All in all, it seems like a decent unit with the set of features that I wanted."
3,ESL/ELL,"I found this book very difficult to follow and understand due to the wording. It was a required textbook and I did not care for it. If I was more proficient in the terminology used, I might have liked the book better."
2,A mixed review....,"I was glad to see that there was finally a book devoted specifically to IT asset management, and was pleased with the novel way that the author went about conveying his knowledge of the subject. The book was somewhat dated though, and obviously structured to steer readers towards the product that Mr. Jesse's company sells. (Not that there is anything wrong, particularly, with that....just that I would have preferred to see something with a bit MORE substance than I found in the book that would be of use to me if I didn't have his specific product."
4,childcare,Have your own childcare business? This is a book that helps you if you are looking at a theme curriculum. Young kids really enjoyed the different themes.
4,God-darned Good,"What is death? What is life for that matter? What do our spaces, both real and virtual tell us about ourselves? Themes of transference, distortion and escapism abound in this terse, crackling novella that speaks volumes about who we are as both an addictive culture and a culture immersed in our ubiquitous virtual realities. A fine, fast read that lingers long after the story ends. Dennis Cooper can turn a smart phrase like a short-order cook but there's much more to God Jr. than a quick meal. This is deceptively powerful book that I've read twice now and will read again."
4,Typical low-down Byther (that's good!),"Nobody does low-down, deep blues like Byther Smith. At times his guitar playing invites B.B. King comparisons, but Byther is lonelier, edgier, tougher and more personal. Byther's blues cut. ""President's Daughter,"" ""Blues on the Moon,"" ""Give Me My White Robe,"" (harrowing, that; who else packs such a wallop singing about getting ready to die?), ""Runnin' to New Orleans"" and ""Monticello Lonely"" are standouts. Two or three cuts are weak, but that's a minor quibble on a very fine Chicago/Mississippi/Delta electric blues record."
1,Smoke & Mirrors,"Pay attention and ask yourself - what does Dayle really do to ""solve"" the crime? Nothing, nada, zip. Spouts a few platitudes that any good cop could figure out for him or herself. Dayle's the master of the obvious. One news item I read about a recent case said she wasn't even present at the time of the investigation. Pretty easy to be right all the time if it's after the fact."
1,For Advanced Excel VBA Users ONLY,"I agree with the previous critique. I came to this site after purchasing the book and I should have come before I purchased it. I access the site to see if I was the only one of the opinion that this book was not a guide to learning Excel VBA for beginners or even intermediate Users.It seems as if Mr. Birnbaum is trying to impress us with this knowledge of Excel as opposed to guiding us through Excel VBA. The projects are much harder than they need to be. I realized that in the ""compare workbooks"" project.If you are an advanced Excel VBA programmer this book might work for you. What Mr. Birnbaum fails to realize is if you are an advanced user he has no need to inundate you with the first 10 chapters of information. If you are not an advanced User then the projects need to reflect that."
2,thermometer,The face plate under the glass curled up and not the theremometer doesn't work properly. I honestly don't know what happened to it... I have since purchased another brand
2,"promising, but sliding into mediocrity","'Microeconomics and Behavior' is considered a good intermediate level microeconomics textbook where most other texts are too basic or too advanced. Unfortunately, buyers are better off buying the older 3rd edition. The new 4th edition is not noticeably improved on its predecessor. For some reason, the editors have decided to leave out all the appendices (which were in the 3rd edition) and have them posted on a web site. The appendices were useful mathematical extensions for more enthusiastic and able students. This slimming is claimed to be in the interests of creating a more 'focused' textbook, but it's sad to see yet another promising microeconomics text become added to the swelling ranks of mediocrity."
1,Random errors with Canon SD400,"I've been using this card for 3 months now and it gives me random memory errors on my Canon SD400, making it impossible to take photos sometimes. Beware!"
1,Unable to access everything that was supposedly on the video,"The intervview was interesting. However, I downloaded this feature so that I could use the content focused on Three Skeleton Key. This 30 minute feature doesn't seem to be included, as stated in the decription."
5,Garmin Forerunner carry case,Perfect for transport/traveling with my Garmin Forerunner. Search for a good price as I paid $ 22.00 and also saw it priced over $ 40.00 at numerous locations.
2,Too Small,"I have the forerunner 405, heart rate monitor, and foot pod. I was hoping the case would be large enough to carry these along with my charger. They all fit, but it is very cramped. The case isn't quite long enough for the heart rate monitor, so it needs to be folded a bit to fit it in. On the positive side, the case is very solid and well made."
3,Not the best fit for the Forerunner 405/405cx,"I bought this case to carry/protect a Forerunner 405cx while traveling and specifically to protect the watch from accidental button pushes which would bring it out of power saving mode and discharge the battery. This case achieves that goal only if the watch is carefully positioned in the case. While everything fits (watch, charger, Ant Stick, chest strap, foot pod), the chest strap must be somewhat uncomfortably contorted to fit. The watch is also a tight fit (with the standard band-not the velcro one) which is actually a good thing because it holds the watch rigid helping to prevent the buttons from being pushed. The case has a semi-rigid clamshell design with an elastic mesh webbing on each side that holds stuff in on either half. Not a perfect solution for the 405 or 405cx but it works. So far I have not opened it to find a dead battery but I would have rated it higher if it had a dedicated compartment for the watch that would protect the buttons."
3,A bit pricy,"Good casing where my forerunner 305, cables and HRM, just fit there is not room for more. A bit pricy..."
4,A Different Conde,"Heremakhonon takes a different bent for Conde in which it seems that she was writing to a rhythmn of very fast-paced drums. It is more complex than Segu. Looking for herself the young protagonist goes to Africa leaving behind the subtle effects of racism in the US. It is an adventure for her and the reader. Anyone who likes the direct contact with the protagonist's mind will love this novel. In reading it, you don't have to wait long to find out exactly what she thinks in any situation, Conde puts it right there for you. It is a book written in an abrupt and intriging style."
5,Very well constructed and great features,"I bought this timing light to replace an older one for simple tasks. When I tried it on my car, I was impressed with the features on it. Since I have a 1994 GMC Jimmy, I couldn't use the dwell angle feature, but the advance and retard feature on it is very nice and convenient for me. RPM gauge is nice, although I had a little trouble getting it to stay in sync with some newer vehicles. Still exploring the features on it. If you want a high quality timing light with the freedom of multiple features, I would recommend this."
5,Equus 5568 Pro-Timing Light,"Solid product, executes all functions I have used flawlessly. I have not used the advance and retard modes yet, due to not having them on the cars that I have used the light on."
5,solid product,I bought this as an interim solution to replace the awful OTC timing light that broke while I saved up for a snap on timing light. I am no longer going to buy a snap on because this product from Equus is a damn fine tool and has everything I need in a timing light. A solid well made tool that does it all in a very nice case.
5,A very tasty variety of peanuts,The product arrived promptly and in good condition. I liked the convenient sized containers. The peanuts were fresh and not broken into small pieces. I am enjoying them daily and highly recommend them to those who like peanuts. Bill Lebus
4,Sondheim and Hearn Rule!,"To: Mark Orell; That little bit that Pirelli sings before he is slain does not have a name; it's technically a reprise of ""The Contest"" with different words. Anyway, Sondheim is God and ""Sweeney"" is my favorite show of his (""Passion"" running a close second.) George Hearn is the best Sweeney ever; I paid [250$] for a seat in the balcony to see this concert at Lincoln Center - worth every penny! I think George Hearn is much better than Len Cariou, who ain't bad! When Hearn yells: ""At last, my right arm is complete again!"" it never fails to thrill! I agree that Patti Lupone is no Angela; but still enjoyable. I saw it with Audra McDonald as the Beggarwoman; unfortunately, she is not on this DVD, more's the pity. I saw this production at the Kennedy Center; Christine Baranski was an excellent Mrs. Lovett; however, I felt Brian Stokes Mitchell was miscast (and let me hasten to add that I love him). This just isn't his part."
3,Patti LuPone is an awful Mrs. Lovett!!!,"TRULY! NO ONE CAN REPLACE ANGELA LANSBURY as the grotesquely avaricious Mrs. Lovett...honestly, I was so horrified at Ms. LuPone's portrayal of the character I could barely register the rest of the cast! Her delivery was breathless, and not in an effective manner...why, she sounded completely winded on several numbers, and her ""take"" on dialogue delivery was so completely off I felt nothing but pity for George Hearn (who was, of course, brilliant, as always). While generally I enjoy her (I loved her in ""Anything Goes""), I was tremendously disgusted with Patti LuPone's inept delivery in this performance, and HIGHLY RECOMMEND anyone who's not seen this fantastic musical (and easily one of my very favorites) to partake of the Len Cariou/Angela Lansbury 1982 edition."
1,Break-your-ear Hands Free Headset,"despite the fantastic reputation that motorola products have kept over the years, this one is definitely NOT part of their line of terrific products. i have to admit that it does in fact work well in the sense that it is indeed clear, but comfort is not part of this package. the over-the-ear piece is made of very sturdy AND uncomfortable plastic, very painful over long periods of time. for those with ""larger-than-normal"" earlobes, watch out for massive blood restriction if not swelling in the ears. the speaker microphone barely moves enough to reach the mouth. as opposed to rotating in a 360 degree circle, it barely moves 90 degrees in each direction; therefore restricting the microphone to a very select area. i would highly recommend looking at a more comfortable hands free set; this one is a definite LOSER~"
5,Great twist on an old favorite.,This book is a great twist on the old favorite. A lesson for children in sharing and helping. I've used it when teaching preschoolers and they really enjoyed it.
1,For the new generation,"There was a time when we taught our children the value of hard work and allowed them to face the consequences of their choices. But people don't want such character-building concepts to enter the minds of their children these days. Now it's perfectly acceptable to refuse to work and still reap the rewards. Now it's the little red hen -- the one who does all the work herself! -- who is in dire need of learning her lesson to share with the very people who told her to buzz off because they only wanted to eat, not to actually earn their supper. This is the Little Red Hen told for a new generation. So if you want your kids to grow up to be undisciplined moochers, here you go. It's a very sad state of affairs that our culture praises this new version so highly."
2,Love Sony Hate the Camcorder,"I purchased the camcorder for family events etc. The video quality is good, get what you pay for, but the still picture quality is/was horrible (@.39)!!!!! I took the camcorder back to Best Buy and will continue to look for a good zoom, high quality still & video CCD."
3,Review,"Everything is good so far, except the remote is missing...... As i was reading the manul,,, i m suppose to have a remote along with this camera... I don't know how to claim that..."
1,Horrible software and PC interface !!,Byt this only if you plan to never never make a DVD out of multiple DVDs.. ;-) - that is the most common thing I do .. and i guess you all do too.The software which comes with it is terrible. Does not recognize the camcorder when it is connected to the PC - even the the Picture Motion Browser is up !!DO NOT PURCHASE - unless you have your own software to work with!
3,Can't use touch screen,"One of my biggest problems with this case is that you can't use the touch screen when the case is closed. The screen cover is made of hard plastic.Another problem I have with the case is access to Comm and Ok buttons. The buttons are partially covered by the case, making it hard to press.Other than that, I guess this case is fine. It can really protect your TyTn from damage."
4,Mamet with all the brillance and none of the violence,Unique screenplay that is virtually all dialouge. I've read it twice and still can't fully grasp how he makes the picture so clear in my mind with so little description. Impressive and a great education.
5,Daughter Loves this Book!,"My daughter had seen this book at an art store and wanted it for her birthday. It has been all that she hoped and it has helped with her art and she has enjoyed it very much. It has helped her to improve her character drawing skills both on paper and digitally, on her tablet."
4,u2 dvd collector's box,a lot about the history of the band and how they started out. some about bono's extra projects. no real interviews with the band.
2,Only if you love the comic,"Only buy this movie if you absolutely LOVE the comic version (I do). This satisfied my need to see Vampirella in a film but that was about it. Talisa Soto as Vampirella was the only good acting in this whole movie. She really did a good job (but then she always does). The rest ranged from unbelievable. I really find it hard to believe that after spending several thousand years on earth the head vampires would be this stupid. Unless you have a penchant for Ms. Soto or the Original character this one isn't going to tak eyou anywhere, I wouyldn't even recommend it to general vampire movie fans."
1,Absolutely horrible,"I am a fan of vampires. I am a fan of vampirella. I like to try to convince myself that essentially awful movies about the things I like are still good movies. However, such action was utterly IMPOSSIBLE with this film. I cannot believe that some people have given this movie over one star. That's the truth. This is the most horrendously sickening movie ever to tarnish a video tape. The direction could not be worse. Ditto for the acting. I was tempted to hit myself for watching this movie. The plot SUCKS, and only an unseasones moviegoer (or a blind, deaf person) would say otherwise. ALL the actors sucked, even Miss Soto. Don't even get me started on Vlad. Avoid this at ALL costs. They should pay you for watching it."
5,THis was a subscription,"Threads is a very good magazine. It is a bit more advanced than most people can handle... If you are in to couture sewing and tailoring, then you will enjoy this"
4,not the Threads magazine of the past,"I used to dream about subscribing to Threads and drool over them in the library, but the new format beginning in Fall 2005 is disappointing. They have added many more articles of interest to very new sewers such as how to choose the correct needle for a fabric. This basic info is readily available in many basic sewing books and it is not why I renewed to Threads for another 3 years. This magazine once showed cutting edge techniques and lots of projects that intermediate and advanced sewers could savor. As a beginning sewer I used to dream about conquering the exciting projects in Threads. Now, they have watered it down to appeal to less skilled people at the expense of the projects and information that made it stand out from other sewing magazines. This is still a ""good"" magazine, but no longer excellent. I wish that I could get back my money for the next 3 years and spend it on fabric."
2,Changed format/contents,"I have always enjoyed every issue of Threads in the past. The new format / contents does not appeal to me. Threads is now a beginner sewing magazine like many others on the market. Thread's was once a great magazine, the only one on the market for the intermediate and advanced sewers. The projects were wonderful and I and other's I know kept every single issue. Not now, there isn't really much in Thread's for the wearable art/advanced sewer. I will really miss the couture finishing techniqes and other articles with new ideas. These articles were much more detailed than any book. Because of this detail a sewer with some experience could use these articles to become an advanced sewer more quickly than buying many books. I only gave the 2 star's because it is a nice beginner magazine. If you are new to sewing this is a good magazine, but the more advanced sewer's should pass this one up."
1,These do not work,"I have tried the CCB Navigator and now this product. Neother works. I took both to the cellular phone dealer (who does not sell these products because they don't work). They told me that the aftermarket products are not very reliable and after 2 tries at the CCB product and 1 try at this, I agree. I'm off to trade this product for an earpiece. Too bad. I wished it worked."
2,Rusted!,"I got this knife set for my in-laws last Christmas. They have already rusted and look terrible. They cut well, but they can't put these out for nice dinners because they look terrible. We're very disappointed."
2,not as helpful as I thought,"The university I am attending actually recommended this book as a study guide for the CLEP exams. I thouroughly studied the natural science section. I learned a lot, but to my surprise when I took the test, a lot of the material on the exam was not covered in this book. Needless to say, I did not pass. Maybe the other sections are closer to what is covered on the exams."
1,Book not for everyone,"This book is an exhaustive list of bass drum/snare drum combinations and permutations. NOTHING MORE. The idea here is that there are 476 two beat phrases that can be individually put together in any grouping. It is a mathematical, systematical chop builder. No musical information or application is motioned. This can be great for the beginner to learn basic drumbeats (hence, the five star reviews below) or a large disappointment for someone looking for drum information and guidance. There are many other drumset books that accomplish more than what this book has to offer.I wish I knew this before I bought the book."
2,"Nice Logo, poor material.",Turn around time to receive item was good. Material of the shirt was sub-par (very thin) for the price.
4,Inuyasha Movie Box set,"If you are an Inuyasha, fan then this box set is a must-have! 4 films with the original cast members that takes place before the final act series. (Although I'm not sure when exactly they take place...) I enjoyed them very much."
5,Loved it,Saw it on the TV and wanted the CD for the car as opposed to the DVD - loved it loved it loved it
1,I hate this series!,"These super-short Bratz books are so stupid! They are hardly even books! They are just pictures of the ugly Bratz showing off their inappropriate clothes to 5 year olds, who will probably be the only people reading these stupid books!It also comes with fake tatoos that won't stay on. That's not a big surprise.Don't buy these books. You'll just be wasting your money."
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this book. I bought it for my 8 year old. He loves the Redwall videos, but this model was difficult to put together (even with my help) because the directions weren't clear and it didn't stay together after we did find which ""tabs"" went together. Also, it is not sturdy enough for child's play. I wish I had read more of the negative reviews to that I wouldn't have bought it."
3,Garentied to fall apart!,"Falls apart easily, and a lot of the details you can't see. So honestly, I rate it three."
5,A revealing and needed book,"Larry McShane shows proof here of the old saying ""No good deed goes unpunished"". I was lucky in 1972 when I fatally shot a suspect trying to kill my partner and me. No one tried to say I was anything other than an officer doing his duty. Others have obviously not been so lucky. This book points that out, and I am gratified to see that these incidents are getting some attention. A good read for all who care about their community.Wayne D. Ford, Ph.D., author of Managing Police Stress. docwifford@msn.com"
5,fin fan,"loved all the commentary, i've seen this on tv a million years ago and been wanting it on dvd ever since. personally i think the dolphins of 72 could crush any team in 2012."
3,Flight to Mars,"Fans of B&W SciFi will enjoy watching the film at least once in a while. A bit too talkie and character based for a film of this quality, it could use more action or special effects time."
1,Bad Original Print,"I collect 1950s era Sci-Fi and I have been replacing my VHS versions with DVDs. Unfortunately, I need to keep my VHS version for this movie because the print that Image Entertainment made this from was in such poor shape. The VHS version by UAV Entertainment (The Wade Williams Collection) is MUCH better. Hopefully, UAV will come out with a DVD version soon."
5,Nice Ride,I was concerned that this shock would make the ride harsh but was pleasantly surprised that it's a comfortable yet controlled ride.Much better ride when pulling my trailer also.The bushing supplied with this shock will not work with a Chevrolet truck as the top opening is larger than the bushings so I had to reuse the original bushings.KYB should supply the proper bushing for GM products
5,Unbelievably amazing,"This CD is unbelievable. I love every song on it.Lost innocence - great tune, and the lyrics are amazing.One Good Reason - my favorite on the CD. Catchy beyond belief.Hole in the Head - awesome melody.God's Roof - not my favorite song, but it has a powerful meaning and quite a guitar solo.Much as I love these songs, the Eric Stuart Band has songs that are even better! So I definitely suggest you buy his CD 'Blue Dressed in Black,' to get the full effect. It has all these songs and more.Also, check out his other CD 'Bombshellshocked.'"
3,Coming Out of the Fog,"This is a parallel story of a boy named Ben and the struggles of Tor, Viking shipbuilder. Ben is recovering from the recent changes in life: death of his mother in a foggy parking lot in Florida and the recent move to dad's home in Newfoundland. The reader is intertwined in the two tales sometimes finding relevancy and at other times struggling to put the two together. I read through the story of the Vikings and concentrated on the story of Ben. An intriguing story that entices you into finding out what really happened on that foggy night in Florida."
3,Not fully developed,"The writing is good and the story is strong, but the connection between Ben and Tor is not fully explained, and the reader is never exactly sure whether Tor existed. There are some passages where ""the game seems to be getting too real"", and these are never elaborated on. I was disappointed because the plot summary on the back cover made me think this was going to be more of a psychic/fantasy/ghost story; instead, it's realistic fiction about a boy who just happens to imagine that he is a Viking sometimes. If that's what you want, then read this book, but if you're looking for a fantasy look elsewhere."
1,Explorer Video Review,I showed this to a group of fifth graders. The narrator talked extremely fast and it was difficult for the students to grasp the concepts.
5,"I LOVED ""THIS YEAR IT WILL BE DIFFERENT""","I loved how this story evolved using so many characters, their experience(s) and the reason they showed up at the Hotel.So sorry Maeve passed away and I will not have another of her wonderful stories to look forward to.Catherine"
4,Misleading title,"Neither the title on the sheet music nor the title on the listing page indicated that this is just the second movement. If you scroll down to the book description, it does say that it is the second movement. Since the sheet music doesn't state this, it would be helpful if Amazon could add ""second movement"" to the title at the top of the listing page. Other than that everything is fine. The pages are easy to turn, unlike some stiffly-bound copies."
5,"The Shield, Season 3",This series has to be one of the best cop dramas I have ever seen. It is gritty and thought provoking and the acting and camera work are outstanding. I love the development of the characters. There are plenty of reviews that offer up a synopsis so I won't go into that.Delivery was quick and the product was in good condition.
5,The Shield Season 3,"Very enjoyable, not quite as good as 1 and 2, but sets up the action for Season 4. Shield fans will buy this!"
2,"Too bad the manual in English is garbled, and there is no tech support","If you want to watch TV on your PC screen, this little box is fine. If you need any of its other features - take your business elsewhere.The manual is poorly translated into English, probably from Taiwanese. Whoever published it failed to notice that the right portion of all paragraphs was chopped off.Try contacting tech support, and the only option is an email address in Taiwan, which totally ignores your correspondence.The price is good. Performance is mediocre. Do NOT purchase this for any other use than watching TV on your computer screen."
5,I like it...,"I bought this TV Tuner from Newegg.com to replace a Kworld Tuner that was a piece of junk.It works as intended. Video and Audio are in sync (it wasn't on the Kworld). It is a small box. I wish the ports were not on three sides which forces you to hide it, but otherwise I am very happy with it. The resizable video window is easy to operate. The video is crisp and clean. It was easy to hook up. The remote is small and aesthetically pleasing.4-12-06 update: When it worked, it was greaat, but it started having problems (computer did not recognize it) so I sent it back. The replacement had the same problem so I sent it back and got another product by another manufacturer to replace it."
2,Very Disappointed,"Bought this thing based on the earlier reviews and the description, and it sounded very good device. However, when the unit arrived, I had some problems with it. For example, I could never tune to any FM station. Looking through forums and reviews, I got an impression that this is a common problem, but I was never able to find a solution. Also, despite what the leadtek site says, I couldn't get audio through the USB cable on my Win XP computer. I had to use the external connection to the microphone, which of course resulted in the horrible sound quality.I returned this one, I look for something else."
1,"TOTAL CHEESE,REMINDS ME OF MEGADETH","Raise Hell is a joke,Sweden is known for awesome bands but these guys [are unacceptable]. I guess if your into Megadeth and Manowar you might like it but its hard to get past the cheesy lyrics and vocals. I mean the song title Babes even sounds hysterical,wait till you read the lyrics. Also the artwork with the vampire ... on the chair is 100% lame. Not Dead Yet makes Holy Target look like a classic(which it definetly is not)and for every good band that comes from Sweden(Arch Enemy,Naglfar)their are a couple of terrible bands(Raise Hell,Messuggah,Divine Souls),so if you can't stand Dave Mustaine vocals stay far away from this worthless CD!"
3,Not enough photos of the cover collection.,It is always interesting to see what others are collecting. I would have liked to see more of the aquarium furniture that was shown on the front cover. I was more interested in seeing the collections than reading so much text.
1,Poor ebook translation,"The content of the book is good. If you are going to buy this, buy the hardcover version. The electronic version is useless. There is no table of contents and you cannot easily refer to different chapters, and the kindle version forces you to read it sequentially like a novel. Save your money for the hardcover copy."
4,Good content but bad look,"This book is very interresting and has the most updated information on stem cell research.Sadly enough the cover does not look very nice and is blotchy, which is too bad as I bought it as a gift for someone else. It looks like a prodution error though.Still, one can always ignore the cosmetic problem of the book, and the content is very good and as up-to-date as it can be in such a fast-paced field of research."
5,Kurt McGettrick !!!,"This CD is another good chance to listen to the very impressive work of Kurt McGettrick, the late great master of the Baritone sax, Bass Clarinet, and flute. Nice compositions. This CD is a bit more tame than this band's other CD. To hear Kurt's wilder playing, listen to Andre Caporaso's ""Avenue 5""."
1,So Disappointed!,"I love this mini-series and own the book. When I saw it for sale on your site, I immediately bought it. Of course I was expecting to see the same film as on TV. What a terrible disappointment to me to view this chopped up, makes-no-sense, version! The parts about Worthy (trying to break away from the old ways) and the Widow's rescue of the daughter (which explains why the parents are so trusting of the Widow) are not even in this version. This version completely destroyed the plot and all the suspence of this wonderful Mini-series. PLEASE could someone put out the entire mini-series on VHS or DVD? I'd sure buy it."
1,bad news,"This was a great movie. Dont sell it, if you are going to cut it to pieces. I want to see the movie, not a short part of it. Please release whole miniseries on dvd."
1,"""Dark Secret of Harvest Home""","This 1986 ""re-do"" of the 1978 miniseries was a terrible disappointment. Right from the start, it didn't have the ""feeling"" of the original, which is what I thought I was buying. It has been so cut up, edited, and condensed as to lose all sense. It isn't even scary anymore! Where's Worthy Pettington, he who drove a tractor to town and was burned as a scarecrow on Kindling Night? Where's the scene where Tamar seduces Nick on the creekbank? I was so looking forward to seeing this again, remembering the miniseries. I feel I got ripped off. Thanks for letting me rant."
3,"Universal, why, why?","There really is no point in buying this (1978) TV series with Bette Davis, because it has been edited way to much. The original series was 300m., but when Universal released it on VHS the cut it down below 120m. which took away a lot of the story's plot. It is very mysterious, but doesn't make much sense due to the harsh edits that have been made. The story is about a young couple Kate and Nick Constantine who move to a strange New England village, just to soon find themselves caught up in mysterious witchcraft rituals. Bette Davis plays the eerie Widow Fortune who has the towns people in her power."
4,Great speakers for a good deal,"I got these speakers for around 8 dollars and they have been amazing. The sound is really good. It isn't the best like dolby speakers but for 8 dollar who cares. It is nice since you can directly hook up your iPOD to the speaker thru aux port. There is also a speaker port for anytime you just want to use your headphones. Overall, I recommend them for anyone looking for good cheap speakers"
1,"Perfect, low-cost solution for low volume","My new motherboard on-board audio did not have enough oomph to drive my desktop speakers to a useable volume. The 1121's solved the problem - full volume and tone controls, good sound (I'm not an audiophile), and nice styling. The convenient aux input is very handy for playing my wife's MP3 player when we're not using the computer."
4,Is the Pot Calling the Kettle Black?,"James Fallows certainly deserves credit for writing an interesting and clearly presentedargument for media reform. However, Fallows' tenure at U.S. News has thus far failed to deliver any of the reforms he touts in his book. A recent study I did of U.S. News articles for 1997 shows that most articles regarding American politics still follow the ""Game"" schema. That is, the focus is on who's winning and who's losing rather than what the issues are. To be sure, Fallows has brought a bit more coverage of the issues themselves, and more significant change may take time. Still, Fallows is quick to criticize journalists turned television pundits in his book. Yet Gloria Borger, a U.S. News columnist, points out at the end of each and every column she writes that she is also a CBS political analyst (read: pundit). Fallows has some good ideas, but as he is learning first hand, when trying to put theory into practice, things sometimes get lost in the translation."
1,I want my money back,I bought this item for the full price. Now I see why it is being offered for 35 dollars LESS. Even now $6 is too much. The problem I am having is that the feedback makes this product unusable. I followed the directions and went to the website for help. It says keep mic away from speakers and close to mouth. My cord is stretched completely away from my speakers...feedback. UNUSABLE.
1,"REALLY BAD, DONT BUY IT","I bought this item, and after reading all the manual and try to use it, I returned to the store and asked for a refund."
1,bad,"it did come with the actual microphone but it did not come with the cord to connect to the tv, so it was pretty much useless."
2,"Volume issues, not for car use","The product does exactly what it claims to, but leaves something to be desired. Your singing volume and the volume of your music can't be adjusted independently, so you end up with the music always being too quiet and your voice always being to loud. I originally bought this for my girl friend so that she could sing along with her music on long car trips, but since you are completely surrounded by speakers in the car, the feedback is deafening. Even using it at home wasn't practical, because in her small apartment we couldn't get far enough away from the speakers. If we turned it up loud enough to hear the music, the vocals were blaring and caused feedback. If we toned the volume down enough to reduce feedback then you couldn't hear the music at all.Not worth the money. I was disappointed."
1,"great idea, bad technology","i ordered this product thinking it would be a blast for a party i was hosting. good thing i checked it out right away or i would have been embarassed at my party. griffin tech. great idea, bad technology. i think they need to take it of shelfs for a while, put some more time into it, then rerelease it and hopefully then it will function properly."
5,Spiritually uplifting,"This is a wonderfully performed concert. Carman gives his all. I don't know what ""A big chunk of funny "" was watching but this was not a comedy and there was no reference to George Carlin or any other jokes. Just a spirit filled evening. This was special to me personally also because I Went to this concert on tour when it was in my city."
4,"Very, very interesting...","I picked up this book at one of my university's libraries, and read it in one sitting. While it is clear, as some reviewers have pointed out, that Cook's knowledge of physics and engineering leaves something to be desired, the sheer amount of information presented leads me to think that if only a fraction of what he suspects is true actually is true, there's a lot of wacky stuff out there that's been deliberately concealed from the public. I even found the WWII history to be interesting and not dry at all.I think the take-home message should be: keep an open mind."
3,Not what you'd think,"""Antigravity"" is too restrictive a subtitle. It implies the author is focusing on gravity. In fact, he focuses on a search for technology that allows flight based on principles other than chemistry and aerodynamics. He chronicles his hunt for clues to alternative technologies hinted at in the footnotes of recent history. These technologies are based upon unusual phenomena, observed and partly tamed but not understood. He believes that significant advances were made in WWII Germany and continue to be developed today in ""black"" government programs. There are many intriguing hints of the existence of this technology and its direction, but the description of theoretical possibilities such as ""zero point energy"" seem only uninformed speculation. The author is severely hampered by a lack of technical training or mindset. Yet, this is an interesting tale with lots of diverse threads woven into an intriguing picture."
4,first review?,"wow...i can't believe no one has reviewed this yet.what a wonderful, wonderful debut album. anyone witha love for early JAMC, the flatmates, shop assistants...hellany of the C-86 bands of the eighties...will absolutelylove this album. the cover of beat happening's ""IndianSummer"" is a bit obvious, but it's still done very well."
5,All the answers,"Talk about a breath of fresh air! Our retirement to orchard country left us wondering what to do with the buckets of apples from the trees on our acreage ... and Proulx and Nichol's book gave us all the answers.It's an easy cover-to-cover read in layman's language, yet it's also good for reference (the many tabs I've installed in our copy make it look like a porcupine).Whether you're a novice or an old-timer at cider-making, this excellent information-packed book should be in your library."
2,Brewers: avoid this book!,"I purchased this book as an experienced homebrewer interested in branching out (I also bought The Compleat Meadmaker, which is excellent and helpful). I was *sorely* disappointed. It has nothing of value to teach about brewing of hard ciders. It does have lots of Foxfire-type info on building a cider press, planting an orchard, choosing cultivars, etc. But there is no real guidance for fermenting cider beverages.If you have a farm and want to press sweet cider, this would seem to be a good book. But if you are interested in ""something a little harder,"" look elsewhere (wish I knew where!)."
2,Wheel of fortune,We found this version of WoF didn't have the correct drivers as part of its installation and needed some Micromedai Flashman 3 drivers. In our particular case we had to organise another graphics card to cope with what was required. Not very IT friendly.
2,Only a 1-player game...,"I purchased this for my son and I to play, but you can only play a one-player game. There is no option for a 2nd or 3rd player. If I had known this, I would not have purchased this version.Other than that, it's fine."
3,Good Book/Lots of errors,"I lost my original copy of this book & decided I need toget another. Upon going through it to refresh somefundamentals, I remembered that there are a lot of simpleerrors in this book in the review problems. Mostly thingslike fogetting to carry pi or getting lead/lag reversed, etc.This becomes really frustrating at times, but if you canoverlook it, then this is a very good book to do a weekendreview of filter basics."
2,Chat from Jon,"I have gotten so much good from the writings of Mr. Kabat-Zinn, especially his book and CD on depression. This was, for me, a meandering talk that made me wonder why he bothered to issue it. I felt like my money had been wasted."
2,Predictable,"This is supposedly a Western ""Mystery"". The mystery is how such a good cast and a director like Henry Hathaway could produce such a plodding, unimaginative movie. There is absolutely no mystery as to ""who dunnit"" and the annoying title song is repeated throughout as in a bad parody of a suspense thriller. Pass!"
4,helpful after back surgery,"After major back surgery, this was recommended by my PT gal --- very well written, easy to use, and helped me alot."
4,Good performance for price,Excellent compass for the money with easy to follow instructions for calibration. As accurate as any OEM product I have had and certainly close enough for most highway travelers.
3,disney cars bank,"I was a little disappointed when I received the cars bank.I was giving it as a gift and it didn't have a box or packaging. Also, it had a few scratches over the decals. It was a little smaller than I expected. One good thing was that it was made of very durable plastic, which is good when giving it to a young child. Overall, I thought it was a little expensive for the product,( I paid 24.99). Although, I'm not sure if it was that expensive because it is a ""collectable"" and I purchased it when it was harder to find, which could explain the no packaging. Nevertheless,my son loves disney cars and it was the perfect piggy bank to give him on his 4th birthday, along with some of the other cars toys."
5,Very nice,"I bought this watch for my wife. She loved it. I think it's very classy. It's a great dress watch, but you can also use it daily as well. After I bought this I compare it with Ecodrive diamond I think this one looks more real even though it's not diamond. Highly recommend it."
5,"God be merciful to me, a sinner: by Seraphim Day","This is the orthodox truth that so many need to find. I am baptized Orthodox and am not ready to die yet because I wont go to heaven without more time. Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner."
4,Only four episodes,"Ripping friends is great but with the only 4 episodes I would have to give it 4 stars. Last week I saw a DVD with all 13 episodes and bought it, but Im not sure whether you can get it in the USA. Worth looking out for though."
5,Youth & Beauty,Anthony Perkins in his youth and beauty plus a pleasant singing voice.'Nuff said. But I must type a few more words to complete this review.
3,strange happenings,"I don't remember where I saw this advertised but I decided I wanted to see it, so ordered it. Hmmm... it isn't bad, just not necessarily what I thought it would be, a musical of sorts. I didn't know that about it. But Anthony Perkins singing is a different perspective than Psycho!"
4,"Unsure? Catch the musical numbers on YouTube, in full","Very nicely, Entertainment One has made the musical numbers from ""Evening Primrose"" available, in full, on YouTube (just search on the musical's title). Enjoy the music box quality of the songs, and judge for yourself--"
4,Lots of nudity but no shower scene?,People please tell me how can you have a womens in prison movie without a show all shower scene? The movie is great and is based on a true story of a women put in a Brazilian prison for the wrong reason. Gratuitous meaningless nudity especially the part they whip the leading actress with wet bath towels... Great movie but no shower scene?
4,"Great Info, Definitely Worth Reading.","This little book, has in one place, all the essential info about NEEM and its many uses (health wise, insecticide etc). I have been reading up on Neem for years but still did not garner as much info as this book ! You won't be disappointed."
2,Not what I expected,Not applicable to my area; thought from the review that i could possibly use it with my study of healing.
1,Absolutely terrible,"The hardest part of this workout was listening to ""The Situation"" talk and creep on the female model. He did ~3 reps of every workout and stuttered every 5 seconds. I own P90x and have played 7 years of football and can honestly say that this was the most worthless workout I've ever seen."
1,I'd rather do anything else,"I tried this workout for the novelity of it and because it popped up on Netflix... bad idea. If you like to be motivated by an instructor, this DVD is not for you. If you would like to do a bunch of push ups and listen to inane comments and a generally stupid man whisper directions to you, then by all means, buy! Don't be fooled by his physique, it is not enough to inspire.If you want a real workout that anyone can do, check out some buns of steel tapes from the 80s (#GregSmithy). You won't be disappointed. Where did all the honest people go in America to motivate us to get up off our lazy, fat butts? The real Situation is that you shouldn't buy this DVD unless you have a thing for the reality TV celebrity involved.The Original Buns of Steel: Intense Target Toning with Less Aerobics"
4,"Madonna soars, but not quite as high","I love madonna. and i'm always open-minded about everything she does. ""music,"" her latest opus, is great but in it's own right. compared to her other works, it doesn't top them but instead nestles in right next to them. i think part of the problem is the image. country/western covers with french techno music is a strange combination, despite the fact that she looked beautiful. the 6 tracks produced by Mirwais are excellent and should provide a good american introduction to french house music. the other 4 are questionable. while i do love this woman, i have to admit: this album contains her most throwaway lyrics (and bland title) in years! but as always, the former material girl keeps the pace going with energetic singing (even if some of it is computer enhanced) brilliant movements, and a stunning video suggesting the madonna of the ""erotica"" years might be making a comeback."
4,fairly good for the price,"i bought one of these a year ago to server as a tv for my N64 and it works great, im just mad it doesnt have an svideo in so thats why i gave it 4 stars"
5,Kick ... Metallica Video,"Very Complete video shows what it was like to be on tour with Metallica. Lots of backstage footage and interviews with the band. It also shows the videos of ""Unforgiven"",""Enter Sandman"" and more. Would recommend this video if you are a Metallica fan."
1,TYPICAL WACHTER,"Dr. Wachter is well known within the medical community and at UCSF for being a slimy opportunist, anxious to put his smirking face on the promo posters for the trend of the month. How surprising is it, then, that with the overhyped concept of ""medical errors"" in the fore of everyone's mind, that we find none other than Dr. Wachter publishing a book on the subject under the auspices of ""academia."" The title itself speaks to Wachter's motive: is this legitimate research or a sensationalist piece of yellow journalism?Which is not to de-legitimize the episodes contained within, or the idea of systemic medical errors in general. Rather to point out that in jumping from the ""noble profession"" of academics to the talk-show publicity circuit, Dr. Wachter loses in credibility what he gains in book sales."
1,Styles don't mix,"After reading a few reviews from other Amazon customers I ventured into buying this record. Let me first say that I love the sound of the trumpet and the synthesizer together. I am a big fan of Mark Isham, Chris Botti and Colin Chin. All these artists have successfully combined the sound of both instruments. Mainly because of their background (jazz) they have created beautiful melodies in the synthesizer which enable the trumpet solos to fit very well. Meg Bowles doesn't bring this to the mix. Space music, which is her forte, dosen't mix that well with the trumpet. Space music in itself lacks melodies. Usually is drones and washes of sounds. By the time the trumpet kicks in you are ready to press the forward button on your CD player. David Bilger is excellent on his solos, however Meg Bowles is not up to par. Skip this one and go directly to Chris Botti - Midnight Without You or Mark Isham - Film Music."
2,No mention of Romer; deficient,"No mention of Paul Romer's work on growth, that makes technological change endogenous. His paper came out in 1991 so there's no excuse for it."
2,Problems,"I too enjoyed the SD-2150 and thought I had made the right choice in buying it after researching many of these reviews. However it has been less then 3 weeks of movie viewing and after freezing up a few times, it finally stopped reading any kind of disc and is currently in the shop."
2,"Great, til it died!","Worked great for a couple weeks, and up until that point I agree with the other reviewers. However, skipping got worse and worse, then it would freeze, and finally, after inserting a disc it would tell me to insert a disc. It stopped working entirely on any DVD or CD. Too bad. My old SD2107 never gave me a problem in over 3 years. Maybe I just had bum luck, but another reviewer noted needed it cleaned after several weeks."
3,"Good for what it does, bad for what it doesn't","I purchased this DVD player based on the quality of Toshiba's DVD mechanism. The player plays DVD-ROM and CD-ROM discs very well. Quality is present and performance is nearly flawless. If these are the only requirements you have, this unit is an excellent choice.BUT there are problems. I had hoped to be able to play my own CD-R recordings. No dice. Toshiba includes a disclaimer in the manual about pirated recordings and their choice not to support recordable discs (at least in this model.) So, if you are creating legitimate recordings, you are still out of luck. Another problem, in my opinion, is the warranty. One year on parts, 90 days on labor. Sorry, but if there's a problem, I expect it to be corrected at NO CHARGE under warranty (including labor.)I am afraid, this may be my last Toshiba purchase."
5,Talk about memories...?,"...""Living In the Footsteps (Of Another Man)"", ""Yes, I'm Ready"", ""Let me Be the Man My Daddy Was"", ""12th of Never""...school boy crush jams! So rare and so, so, so good..."
1,Stay away from Vizio!,This is not an inexpensive TV. This is a cheap TV! Do yourself a favor and stay away. It is guaranteed to fail (perhaps repeatedly). I've yet to meet anyone who has had one of these go for more than 3 years without a failure. Mine failed twice in 18 months - naturally the second failure was 30 days out of warranty! Oh and Vizio will scold you for not buying the extended warranty rather than apologize for a crappy product.
3,Happy End...,"This movie just shows you what can happen when you have someone with ""power"" that's just a little...crazy. In the end, it's another murder story. Three stars!!"
5,All you ever wanted to know...,"Ms. Minow and Mr. Lipinski have written a very thorough, extremely readable volume on a tough topic--libraries and the law. In these times, both patrons and those active in the library world need to know the information in this book.Written in an engaging question and answer format, the book is like reading newspaper questions to the editor with responses!All of us fit in the patron and/or library world categories (right?) and, therefore, I highly recommend this book to everyone. As a person who falls into both categories, I learned a lot--and, with no pain! Five stars."
2,Not for Kindle/iPad!!,"Since Kindle/iPad has no search function, The Real Book VI is very cumbersome on an iPad. You can bookmark desired pages, but the bookmarks indicate page numbers, not song titles. Finding a particular tune involves making a separate written index of titles by page number. (And, by the way, it's not returnable.)"
5,The Real Book: Sixth Edition,"Nicely laid out, easy to read, and useful for the most common standards in the jazz repertoire. Unfortunately, due to copyright issues, some of the tunes present in the illegal version are missing, but this is through no fault of Hal Leonard. A very useful tool for learning tunes!"
2,Missing in Action,"I was very disappointed and plan on returning the item. You would expect , even if the the book is ""used"" to have all of the music contents intact. There were dozens of pages missing, especially in the A section."
5,One of the BEST Bellydance Instructional vdoz,"I had been looking for clear instructions on how to shimmy. And i think out of all the instructions on the net iv seen so far, Amira's instruction on Shimmy is THE BEST AND MOST CLEAR, in Amira's Belly Dance 101 dvd. Not just the Shimmies, but overall, i find the instruction as though she is speaking to a student who duznt know much, and the student gets to know what are the critical things to pay attention to.In one word, i'd say...just go ahead and get this dvd if ur looking for Nice n Clear Instructions on the important moves of Belly Dance!! Practise with this dvd and you'll be really happy with your progress!"
3,Good for basics...,"I found this video to be fun for learning some of the basic moves, but really lacked any substantial content. It felt like there was more to the advertisement for her shows than what was in the actual ""fitness"" video. It was interesting to watch, but seemed to lose something in translation."
5,Basics Helped Me Improve My Technique,"I love Bellydance 101 for Beginners and always look forward to dancing with Amira. Her pleasant personality and love of dance cheers me up while I'm learning and practicing. And I really like that she encourages flexibility through stretching and proper body posture. Initially, my efforts translated to improved health (better balance, body alignment, more energy, more focus). Gradually, I feel I'm building better coordination and technique and can execute more complicated choreography by regularly returning to Amira's basic warm-ups. I recommend this DVD to all of my friends who love to dance and have given it as a gift to quite a few family members!"
5,I loved It! A must buy for beginners.,"I liked the movie a lot. It is very relaxing too. I love the cool down. I always feel great when its over. As far as the set goes, I thought it was nice. Kinda cozy. Anyway evry belly dancer should own a copy."
4,Great book - lousy copy editor,"This book is as great as all the other reviewers say. It's the kind of book that's fun to explore -- each entry is self contained, and there are also a few short sections on the elements in general (for example, a history of the periodic table).The only negative comment I have is the poor copy editing. There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors. In the periodic table section alone, on one page, there were three spelling errors and three numerical errors. Needless to say, this is a especially problematic with a reference work..."
5,A chemistry student's delight,"Much more than merely quantifying the elements, this book adds several dimensions of human interest, including war, historical notes, and an element of surprise, an unexpected bonus that makes each element unique. Several appendices rounded out the available compare and contrast items to make the book, overall, both a delight and an informational storehouse. It has no color pictures or graphs, but otherwise is a whole lot more interesting and informative than the average high school chemistry book. Good for all ages and knowledge levels."
4,"A very good and insightful ""how to"" book on writing fiction","My review is going to be pretty short but I do hope it is helpful. This book has been extremely helpful to me. It addressed some of my fears head on. The ""your turn"" exercises were great in making this book more engaging, interactive, and instructive. I definately feel it gave me good advice and sound guidence in navigating the process of writing strong fiction."
2,"Support Duke, Inc.","As an avid Duke fan and 2001 University alumnus, I was initially very pleased to have received this video as a gift from my girlfriend. However, the video fails to deliver. The swelling music and terse commentary seem very overwrought, and all the action and interview clips have a very patchwork, abbreviated feel. At the end, my first thought was, ""That's it?""If you are looking to complete your personal shrine to Duke Basketball in your parlor room, then buy this video. Otherwise, your money may be better spent on Coach K's new book about the '01 season or on internet access for checking out DBR..."
5,30 Dollar Film Student,"I am very amused by Mr. Deans writing style and I must admit it is the first literature of it's kind that doesn't require me to dose up on ritalin. It's easy to read and he keeps you laughing throughout the book. 30 Dollar Film School is good motivation for getting out there and doing it and not just sitting at home dreaming about it. Cool tips on Funding, Lighting, Software, and vital information about film types can be found in this book. Basically, Mr. Dean shows you how to get your foot in the door.It's a great little, er big book! :)"
4,Confidence Builder,"I needed help in putting together a ""trailer"" type of movie for submission to a cable TV network. That network had requested this DVD as part of my programming submission idea. I called a few local colleges, some local producers and even friends with more knowledge than myself. No one was interested in lending a hand. So, (as Michael says) I decided to D.I.Y. (Do it Yourself). I visited a bookstore, and purchased Michael's publication.Basically, $30 Film School gave me the confidence to create something out of nothing. I've completed the DVD, and will begin the promotion process next. The second edition of $30 Film School even includes a DVD with music tracks (that you can include in your project), short films, contract release templates and other ideas. The DVD alone is worth the price of the book.Thank you Michael Dean."
4,Awesome Book,"This is a must have for video producers. Short films, documentaries, or whatever your appeal this book has something for everyone. I like the plain format, it is meant to be read as informative boot not a novel. Great illustrations and tables, the DVD with my book was damaged so be warned if you buy a book used there are no promises that the media will be usable, however despite that it rocks. Its a must have for my library."
1,save your money,"You might get as much useful information if you go over to your neighbor's house and ask him his opinion about making a movie. This guy did it once (unsuccessfully) and thinks he can write a book about it. Waste of money. If you want to read about someone who made a movie with no money that was actually successful, I recommend ""Rebel without a crew."""
1,Really bad,"Dean spends most of the book talking about how great he is, whether it be as a filmmaker or a musician. He drops names no one's ever heard of, and spouts off about how cool he is. Of course, I've never heard of any of his films or bands, but he'd probably say that he's so ""DIY"" (do it yourself), that only the hardcore folks have heard of him.Dean winds up rambling about making films for nearly 500 pages, but doesn't say much that will help a new filmmaker hone his/her craft. He makes flippant comments about how Hollywood's approach to filmmaking is wrong, and points out that his method is way better, but he doesn't give any convincing reasons why his method is better. In the end the reader is left $30 poorer with film tips they could pick up from someone's MySpace page."
1,How to lose friends and alienate people,"Not the best book on making your own film. I was largely very disappointed. I dont know which books the ""rave"" reveiewers were reading but when I bought this book I thought I must have got a different book with the same title. Interesting in places but I learnt more from reading 1 edition of Moviemaker magazine. The free CD is full of strange files, that whilst probably very interesting to the author, prove to be quite pointless. My advice to anyone really interested in learning the art of movie making the quick way is firstly get a subscription to Moviemaker magazine. For less than $30 you get up to date, useful info. and a free copy of Moviemakers own, ""Guide to making your own Film"". Then look for the only other books I could recommend, ""Rebel Without a Crew"" and ""Roadracers"" both by Robert Rodriguez. Also buy ""El Mariach"" on DVD and check out the 10 minute film school which comes as an extra. Avoid this book."
4,The Best $... I've Spent In A Long Time,"I got this book after spending time in a much more expensive version of film school. ""Thirty Dollar Film School"" gives a lot of practical advice on topics such as financing and distributing a movie that are completely absent from a conventional film school. Add to this the personal experiences that Michael shares in this book along with all of the stuff that on the CD-ROM and you have one rock-solid book.If you have any intention of ever making an independant film in your life, this is one book that you'd be a complete idiot not to buy, read and use."
2,Panasonic KX-TGA200B 2.4 GHz Handset,"We invested over $1100 for the base unit and 8 handsets. At first, the unit worked great. The intercom and call transferring features were especially nice. However, after a year of normal use, the number 1 stopped working on the most-used handset. And last month, the 1 stopped working on 2 more handsets. It's a great phone as long as you don't need do use long distance or have a friend with a 1 in their number. Grrrr. The Panasonic rep in India was of no assistance. He gave us information where we could go PURCHASE more base units. Again, Grrrr."
3,Globe Trekker - Jamaica,"This dvd showed the less than glamorous side of Jamaica and its people. It did not excite me about traveling to that island. There was not one beautiful waterfall or lagoon scene. Lots of views of bad roads, bad transportation, less than appealing 'restaurants', negative commentaries from tourists as well as the 'globe trekker' himself. The last scene of a carnival-type celebration was almost obscene. The 3 stars given because of the reality of the dvd."
5,Polk Speakers,"Polk Audio RTi4 High Performance Bookshelf/On-Wall Speakers, Pair (Black Oak) (Purchased on 11/18/2007)Great speakers, don't need a woofer. Sounds good just as they come. Just the right size and performs like the big ones."
2,Awful and not in a good way,This is my 3rd Mirjam Minger book and I loved the other two. This book was painful and awful. The heroin was not believable. The story line was so full of holes that is made swiss cheese look solid. I really would like the 6 hours of my life back that I wasted reading this book. Don't waste the money or the time.
4,Fine Kindle edition,"First of all, the Kindle listings for Oman's books on medieval warfare are a bit of a muddle, and the conversions vary widely in quality, so make sure you are getting what you pay for. Oman published a short ""Art of War in the Middle Ages: AD 378-1515"" in 1885. This was followed in 1898 by the much fuller ""A History of the Art of War: The Middle Ages from the Fourth to the Fourteenth Century."" Finally, in 1924 this second book was revised and reprinted as the first volume of ""A History of the Art of War in the Middle Ages.""The Tales End Press edition, ASIN B007DQ0VW6, represents the 1898 book and is excellent value for money. It includes the entire text, footnotes, and diagrams, and has evidently been prepared with great care. Highly recommended for students of military history. I subtract a star only because the scholarship of the last century has inevitably revised some of Oman's views."
3,Thunder kick,I purchased this dvd for Bolo yeunge aka Yang sze & he only appeared in onefight & lost. You have to be a true bolo fan to keepOrdering his movies! Some are ok & some are not! I enjoy chop sockey kung fuMovies because I grew up in the Bruce Lee era so I personallyEnjoy them. The best bolo chop sockey I have seen so far isThe Chinese hercules! But again you have to be a Bolo fan orEnjoy chop sockey kung fu!
1,Palm T3 has to be the worst palm case ever made....,"I have been working professionally supporting palms for years and familiar with several models and their cases. This is my 6th palm that I have purchased, but this has to be one of the poorest cases designed for this particular device. They should have put a rubber grip inside the case. Half the time when I extend the screen - it pops out of the case. I have dropped the palm numerous times when just holding the case because the 2 small hooks holding the palm in does not lock it securely. This case gives you little security in protecting this device..."
2,not so bad...,"I had bought hard cases for my previously owned Palms (V and 500) because without one, they were always getting accidentally turned on in my purse, draining the battery. Palm T3 doesn't have that problem because of the placement of the on/off switch. I didn't have a problem with the T3 coming loose from the case, and found it functional - just bulky, a bit heavy and not needed. I'm far happier with a slim leather case that also holds my credit card and 2 expansion cards. But if you are looking for a hard case specifically, I don't think this one is so bad."
2,Mondo Hollywood,"This one is even more bizarre than the Golden Throat's CD (something I honestly thought was not humanly possible). There are more deconstructed pop classics (and one classic country song) which are a scream but the vast majority are topical songs that are silly, but do not hold up so well to repeated listening in my opinion. Check out Golden Throats instead.There is one ""song"" I want to comment on, ""The Ask Not Waltz"". It is a recording of John F. Kennedy's ""Ask not what your country can do for you..."" speech set to a waltz. It has to be one of the goofiest things I've ever heard in my life."
3,Proud To Be . . .,"The book Proud To Be by Kelly Flinn was an interesting read. It opened my eyes to many of the rules of the military and how things are run. I started the book feeling sorry for her and for how she was treated. But, by the end, I felt no sorrow for her. Flinn broke the rules and she was court martialed. End of story. Flinn whines throughout much of the book when she really brings alot of her problems on herself. Granted, I'm not saying that the sexual assault was her fault. But she did have an affair with a man who was married to a military person. The story is interesting and full of stories. It was entertaining and a good read. But don't expect to feel sorry for Flinn in the end. I finished the book asking what exactly she was proud to be?"
2,Simple Issue,"Humm...found this book in a base library after all of these years. The issue is quite simple in my view, Lt Flinn could not, or would not, seperate her desire to be an officer and bomber pilot in our nation's defense from her hormones. There is no greater responsibility, or honor, than commanding our nation's most vital vessels or aircraft. My view is that she gave into her primal instinct for physical companionship and gave up the rarely issued privilege of decisive deadly force authorization. Not many officers draw the attention of their Service Chief. Lt Flinn's outcome was not only fortunate, but she most likely received concessions that others would not have. She did not fall-in-love with the wrong man, she betrayed the special trust and confidence bestowed upon her by the United States Government. I would encourage readers to research what special-trust-and-confidence means."
1,This Book is a Joke and so is Kelly Flinn,Don't waste your money on this joke of a book. Flinn is a whiny slug that is only trying to conjure sympathy with her story. We should all be thankful she's no longer an Air Force pilot--I'm sure the Air Force is.
3,Reusable Coffee mesh screen filter,"Should have mesh on bottom, too. Makes it harder to rinse and clean. My old one was much nicer to use."
2,description was limitted,Mr. Coffee GTF2-1 does not fit all basket style drip coffee makers too large for the JWX3 model. Had to return it and order the 6659 4 cup permanent filter. Most web search sent me to this filter. Extensive searches proved only the smaller model that most inconveniently does not have a handle like the others fit. Would have been perfect if it were the correct option. Be careful when making your purchase.
4,Does the job,This does what it's supposed to and is much cheaper than using paper filters. The only issue with this type of filter is that they don't filter as well as the paper ones but just don't drink the last dregs and save some money and a little bit of the environment at the same time.
4,The price was great!,"I recieved it in the mail after just a few short days after I ordered it. The only little thing I didnt like (not a big deal) was that my Mr. Coffee maker has an auto stop so you can pour the coffee during brewing you dont have to wait till the entire pot is brewed and when I took the coffee pot out, to pour a cup, the filter doesnt stop the auto pour feature right away so there was a little bit of coffee spilling on the the hot plate below. Other than that,Its great. I love not having to buy filters!"
5,Fits Great!,"I was worried that this permanent filter wasn't going to fit my coffee maker, as it is an older Mr. Coffee machine, but it does. It is easy to clean, can go in the dishwasher and eliminates the cost and trash of paper filters. I love it!"
1,awful,This basket was designed for the coffee maker I bought. I have used it twice and TWICE my coffee maker has overflowed because of its use. Pure garbage here folks. don't waste your time or money.
5,No More..,No more.. paper filtersNo more.. collapsed filtersNo more.. coffee grains in your coffeeNo more.. tossing old filters full of spent coffee
3,Does the job but flimsy. Carefull when washing.,Does what I bought it for. However the mesh screen and side cracked under what I would consider light handling when washing. The product is still usable but could lead to cuts if not careful. Just an fyi..
1,"Good idea, bad results","This looked like the perfect product to make coffee without the cost and mess of paper filters. The results did not live up to the expectations. When making coffee with this filter and using the water filter, the coffee? comes out as slightly colored water. Not good. When making coffee with the basket and leaving the water filter off, there is a lot of sediment in the bottom of the pot and your cup. That was not acceptable to me so I have put the filter basket up in the cupboard and am back to buying and using paper filters. The coffee now comes out great. (I buy my coffee in bulk at the market and grind it there using ""drip"" grind)"
5,Basket-style gold,"works great, love that we aren't wasting coffee filters and it's saves us money. totally worth it. works fine with most coffee makers"
3,Curious,This came in a plain cardboard box--no original packaging. I'm not certain it was new. But it works (and I cleaned it really well.)
3,Mr. Coffee Basket Style Permanent Filter,"This is a very good item, but is a lot of work to clean it after each use. Recommended at home, but not for work, because it is not convenient for work when several pots of coffee are brewed at random."
5,Love Air Supply-glad Amazon carries it!,"I recently attended an Air Supply concert in Wendover, NV. and wanted to purchase some of their music. The lines were unreal and there was no control over the crowd so I left and went right to Amazon to purchase the CD. It is a great CD."
5,Best of Air Supply - great album!,"We went to an Air Supply concert with an older friend who had never heard their music, and she loved it! So I bought her the CD and she was thrilled to be able to hear all the songs she had enjoyed."
5,Works Well and Reasonably Priced - Recommended!,"We bought these Kirkland ""Ibuprofen Tablets"" at the warehouse store that has ""Kirkland"" as it's store brand. My wife and both take Advil (along with other prescription medication) to help with arthritis pain and other muscle and joint pain.We find these work every bit as well as Advil and they are usually less expensive.Highly Recommended!CFH"
1,"WOW, Do I feel like an Idiot","I think the title of this review says it all. The items arrived right on schedule, but it turns out I was actually in Costco that night for some other stuff. The actual retail price for this two pack is $8.99. I feel like an idiot. Just wasted five bucks. I guess the moral of this story is it's possible to make a profit buying retail from one store, uping the price, then reselling it to suckers like me. Maybe be if you didn't have a membership this might be a good deal (I thought it was), but then again I'll bet you know someone who does..."
4,Works But Has Side Effects,"These help with pain but cause tinnitus. OK for daytime, but if I take it at bedtime the ringing in my ears keeps me awake."
5,A must for collectors of English Victorian Plate!,If you collect English Victorian silver plate this book is a must. It has the most comprehensive directory of English silver plate makers marks I have ever seen. There are also Sheffield Plate marks which could come in handy if you can not decide if your piece might be electroplate or Sheffield Plate. If you collect American plate this book is not for you as there is little info on American marks.
2,Rubbs Ankles,I like the basic construction of the shoe however the straps rub my ankles and make for terribly uncomfortable wear.
3,It wokred in Spanish.,"I used to be a big fan of Spanish edition of this book. Unfortunately, it is not enough for French. They are totally different people and more demanding. This book can put you in a very dangerous spot. If you want to save 5 minutes before an interpreter arrives, it may be a good help, but French patients will not let you go just with this book."
4,Episode List,"Season Four contains episodes 82-99.82 Gap Between the Ages83 The Female Wolf-Demon and the Lunar Rainbow Promise84 Koga's Bride-To-Be85 The Evil Within Demon's Head Castle86 Secret of the Possessed Princess87 Kikyo's Lonely Journey88 The Three Sprites of the Monkey God89 Nursing Battle of the Rival Lovers90 Sota's Brave Confession of Love91 The Suspicious Faith Healer and the Black Kirara92 Plot of the Walking Dead93 The Mysterious, Lecherous Monk94 The Sacred Jewel Maker Part I95 The Sacred Jewel Maker Part II96 Jaken Falls Ill97 Kirara Come Home!98 Kikyo and Kagome: Alone in the Cave99 Koga and Sesshomaru: A Dangerous Encounter"
5,Not for the layperson but an excellent study,"If you are the average person looking for a book about Romans in the movies, this book is most likely going to give you a headache because it is focusing on tracing large trends in how Italian and American movies have used Rome for variety social and political agendas. At times there is real oppositions, an Italian movie arguing for a fascist state while during the same period an American movies makes a pro-democracy film -- both movies are based on the same book, the same historical events, or the same legend. All of that changes as society and politics changes in both the USA and Italy. Maria Wyke tackles a huge amount of material and traces these changes over more than a century. I'm certain it wasn't easy to research and write and it isn't a quick read, not even for a scholar of the ancient world or film."
2,Funny movie leads to....OH BROTHER!,"After spending a few years in a singles ward myself, I thought the movie was funny because it pretty much described each person that I was around with. The humor started to get old real fast and I soon found it dull and really ridiculous. I don't really care for movies that leave me feeling like I have the IQ of a slug. By watching this, it has taught me to stay away from LDS comedy movies in the future. I gave it 2 stars because I feel that they at least tried."
2,Really Not Worth the Change I Paid,"There's nothing new or noteworthy in this book. The diet, and the science behind it, appears to be revamped Pritikin.""Stop Inflammation Now!"" was my purchase choice because it's hard to determine the components of an anti-inflammatory diet. Every website/blog seems to have a different opinion/theory/definition of inflammation-battling foods, and I can honestly say the reasoning in this book was no better or worse than a lot of what is available at no cost.Finally, the actual diet is too restrictive and rigid. Moreover, I question the nutritional balance of the scheme."
5,A Miestro shows how,In 1966 when a local station in Evanston IL played Chacksfield's rendition of Buttons and Bows (included in this collection) I dropped my body shop tools and stood at attention for the duration of the play. Here is a British Orchestra working its magic on a chronologically arraigned collection academy award winners. The result fires the soul as only genius can.
3,Excellent book but too outdated,"I was excited to purchase this book only to find that its material is out-dated, finally realizing this is a re-publication of the original book. Professor Reza is of course a great expert in the field, but I'd have loved this book to include new improvements in the field of decoding, etc."
4,"Enjoyable, tantalizing","This is an enjoyable, tantalizing book, with some dull spots in the earlier chapters. It is an account of Fisher's 3 years in Dijon, where she moved in 1929 so that her new husband could pursue a doctorate. She was 20 years old, bright, pretty, charming, in love, and most of all, enthusiastic. The reader gets caught up in all this, so as to overlook the book's serious drawback. Fisher can write very nicely, but you learn much more about her landladies than her husband. Fisher says of her sister Norah, ""she TOO speaks always with reserve"" (caps mine). The book is written as if you are already acquainted with Fisher, as no doubt many readers are, but for the rest I would recommend, before starting the book, that they look up M.F.K. Fisher in Google and thereby get to the site about Fisher sponsored by Les Dames d'Escoffier International."
4,One sausage short of a BBQ,"an excellent read, just a couple of gripes coincidently both involving bass players. I would've liked to know a bit more about how the author (Jim Greer, natch) came to play bass for GBV in the mid-90's (he never mentioned it), plus there was nothing in the book explaining the departure of latter-day bass player Tim Tobias. those minor issues aside, I loved the book, as I do the band. thanks for everything GBV..."
2,Review,Easier to read than two years before the mast and a complimentary companion for it...however very political and outspoken....Melville focuses more on the evils of the navy than just telling a story with both light and dark in it
3,yeah it's okay,"This book is a step up from common sense in that it has a few more details when dealing with certain injured body parts. But unless you're going to be in the middle of nowhere doing extreme sports, you probably don't need this book. If you hurt yourself, the procedure is pretty much the same for everything: rest and professional help when you need it."
4,A great eye opener,I found this book to be have great guidelines and usefulinformation in taking steps to protect the assets.
2,bad but NOT as bad as Johanna Lindsey's Pirate book,"I read the whole thing. It seemed like such an extremely long book to me. Throughout it all, I just wanted it to end. I always finish books, because you just never know. This almost felt like I was reading the very long literary version of ""The Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie, without an interesting curse or interesting characters. Considering the fact that I liked that movie but didn't like this book, rent that flick and skip this paperback."
1,horrible,"This is the first time I've ever refused to finish a book. After Justin practially rejoices at his brother's death, he goes off an rapes the guy's wife. It just made me so mad I had to stop where I was. I like Lisa Kleypas, but I have to say this is her WORST book."
1,leave it on the shelf,"I normally like her books, but this one was not only hard to read, but mildly offensive. I have always enjoyed her books because they show women as strong, capably people- this one does not. And while rape may be appropriate in pirate literature and historically correct, I choose not to read stuff that glorifies it.In short, even if you normally enjoy her works, leave this one on the shelf."
2,Confusing layout,"I have had many lab books and this one is the worst. The layout is confusing. While in my experience my lab manuals have been in bullet, short paragraph form, this book was in a longer format. The procedure is not outlined in clear steps and I haven't gone through the entire book yet but in at least one case so far there was a critical part of the procedure left out of the book that my lab TA had to mention. There is also a poor flow of thoughts in the book. Each section requires you to go back and read pages earlier in the book in order to understand what the current lab exercise is about."
3,useful information but poorly organized,"The previous reviewers are correct in pointing out that the organization of the book is almost random. Also correct is the statement that end of chapter questions are frequently too challenging for 2nd year students (why would a 1st semester ochem student know how to estimate NMR peaks???). And yeah, there are some glaring omissions in the procedures while way too many words used in most places.I found it surprising that students had to go online to look up a 1 page supplement to the book on refractive index... why was that one page made an online topic? could not possibly have been that it didn't fit. The directions to find it were poor, it took me an hour to find it, and most of my classmates could not. If the author is going to publish that the information is to be found on line, at least give the freaking link so it can be found.Annoyances aside, the information is good and helpful if you can slog through the information. Or find it."
5,Good book,"If I had the tools I would do a few of these experiments on my own,. But I only brought this book to fulfill the textbook requirement for the class."
5,Microscale Organic Labratory,This book was required for my organic chemistry labratory class. I found amazon had the best price for this book.
5,Earth Surface Processes review,The book as a product is very well written and it contains everything a young geologist need in terms of sedimenterary geology and the physical processes that govern the sediment transport. I highly recommend it.
2,Meh.,"I guess if you are actually taking the class somewhere you would have to get this, but I figured I'd just get the books/kits and learn on my own. Nothing in here that you can't learn for free on You Tube, and the tiny oval pans just get in the way, I just don't know what to do with them. My biggest complaint is for all the course kits, several of them have the exact same tips, mats and lame cake stands in them. You would think each kit builds off each other, but instead each kit assumes you don't own any of the others and comes with stuff you already have. So keep that in mind when getting these."
2,Could have been better,"Their are so few books dedicated to the darker side, so I snatched this one when I found it. Good descriptions, of the dark god/godesses are given-but hey, why were the Celts left out? Also, how the author managed to put a newage happy twist on goddesses like Kali and Hecate is beyond me. Overall it was ok-though I wish someone who actually worked with ""the dark side""of the Dark side would have wrote it."
4,Review of Never Look Back,"Never Look Back held my interest and I couldn't wait to read the next page. A lot happens and the characters are very well written. The story takes you from Richard Webb's early life through all his exciting experiences, first with his psychopathic son,and then his so called dilemma between his wife and girlfriend from hell. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Some exciting twists."
3,comfortable but the wood of the back broke soon,"comfortable but the wood of the back broke soon, after two days from assemble. what a shame!I didn't call the productor, wrap the broke place with tape instead.after all, it is comfortable and my baby and me both like it,day and night."
4,"comfy but slightly squeaky, motion sickness!","Very pleased overall. Husband hates the noise but I don't mind it much. The oil or lubricant that allows the seat to glide smoothly seems to be the source, sounds like rubbing a plastic bag with lots of tiny ""pops""Seat is plush and supportive, about the size of an airline seat but without the neighbors! Happy that the seat locks in position (5 choices I think). Just as happy with my feet on the floor, although I have long legs.Motion sickness was unexpected! This has been a problem for me during the whole pregnancy (never before ) and this chair does make me queasy sometimes.Assembly was delayed and tricky because the seat board is not labeled top/bottom or left/right. Felt like a genius when the third try worked: all other orientations fail! Cushions are a breeze."
2,Not convenient for breastfeeding,"We received this glider as a gift for our first baby. The assembly was a little challenging - but it came together without too much trouble. The chair and ottoman look beautiful - the wood and material are very nice. However, after a couple of weeks it became clear this chair just wasn't going to work for us. The arms are very narrow and high up - making it very difficult to breastfeed or bottle feed. I found myself feeling very restricted in the chair. Additionally the ottoman is significantly lower than the chair, which was very uncomfortable for me. The back cushion also stuck out too much at the top and hit me in the middle of my back. I am 5'3, so it might work better for someone who is taller. While it is a good looking product, a price, and a nice enough chair to just sit in - I found it to be a bad fit for a nursing chair. We returned it without any trouble and found a chair that is wider and lower to the ground."
2,Not a good chair.,Not very smooth. We bought another that is one third the price that rocks so much better. Do not buy
4,generally happy with it,"Bought this glider right before I had my daughter and it was very easy for me to put together. My daughter ended up having to stay in the NICU for 3 weeks due to prolonged labor, so I used this glider while pumping and it was the most comfortable place to be. Company comes over and loves to sit in it as it is really a comfortable addition. Only thing I don't like about it is the material stains very easy if something (milk or spit up) drips on it, also my dad (5'11, 170ish) had his feet on the ottomon and it snapped in half. The construction of the ottomon is a little cheap. Have had the set up since Aug 2011. Still happy with the glider though."
4,Good quality for less,"Easy to assemble, good quality, much cheaper than other models. only complaint is no real lumbar support."
4,So far it works pretty good,"I've only had it one day, order it thinking I had a bluetooth module in my Toshiba laptop, nope. Just know, if you buy this you need to have a USB Bluetooth dongle if it's not standard on your PC/Laptop.It loses one star because it is a little annoying having to wake up the mouse. It's not horrible, but if you're going to play shooters I could see how it could be annoying, even ruin your game.Overall, it gets the job done pretty well."
2,Save yourself money,"Ordered this for my Grandma. It came in a timely manner but she was not happy. You are paying close to $40 for a wooden block with some material on it, 3 plastic needles and a tiny bottle of distilled water (literally). The bottle that comes in the package doesn't say ""cleaning solution"". It says, ""distilled water"". Save yourself some money and buy just the needles. You can buy distilled water for $1 at the grocery store and a piece of soft fabric from you local craft store for next to nothing."
2,Transamerica wide screen,"This is rather a juvenile story, very predictable. Being a tranny my self, I was rather looking forward to a better grade of story. I have given the DVD to friends as I probably wouldnt watch it again. Dissapointing too that the role was played by a woman."
2,Wasn't Impressed,I thought the acting in this movie was wonderful. It was what I thought it would be but it just did not do anyhting for me. I wasn't impressed with it at all. It was bland in some points and in others I thought it was finally picking up it would go back down. I think it is a wonderful story but it just did not impress me at all. Definatly not a movie I would watch again or refer anyone to.
2,After-school special,"One star for Felicity Huffman's remarkable performance (the whole cast is good, actually), plus another star for tackling a sensitive subject in a sensitive way.The script is ho-hum, though, and far from edgie. It's all a bit too ""Wong Foo"", if you know what I mean. If you need to pat yourself on the back for being open-minded, then this is the film for you. Me, I'll be rewatching _Hedwig and the Angry Inch_ for the umpteenth time."
3,Kudos to Andrea James,"On NPR today, Felicity Huffman's voice coach, Andrea James, was interviewed. She is the number one trainer of the stars to sound like men pretending to be women. I must say that she has that talent herself. The segment did not mention the obscene pictures of Michael Bailey's children that Andrea James had on her wesite during 2003. I wonder what Felicity Huffman would say about that. Perhaps Andrea James told her about them?"
5,Awesome Movie!,This is an awesome movie. I'm not sure why it wasn't a bigger hit. An awesome performance by Felicity Huffman!
3,It's an okay movie,It wasn't as funny as the reviews made it sound. It was more of a drama and I was looking for a comedy. Not a whole lot of laughs but a pretty good movie.
3,"It's O,K.",A transsexual woman learns she is the father of a long lost son. They go from New York to L.A. to get surgery. I thought it was a worthwhile film to see at least once. Earned an Oscar nomination for best actress.
3,Worst Therapist in the WORLD,What therapist would insist that a person going the week before for a sex change must fly across country to bail out a criminal who MIGHT be related. Bree could have been killed by this strange and messed up boy. It was impossible for me to get past this total lapse in believability.I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 1 only because the acting by Felicity was of course stellar but the forced plot just ruined a truly great idea.
2,"Buy this to support the band, then see a live show","Only discovered Zero a couple years ago, religiously try to make it to every Bay Area show i can, was only entertained by their Fillmore show which they used as the bait for their new CD. The tunes are OK, but i'm sure they could have almost randomly picked any good live performances and slapped them together on a disc and have a commercial success. My main beef with this album is that they include the Zero yang to the exclusion of the Zero yin. They include the chord progressions, lyrics, and set up the song, then at 5:30 they fade out, leaving the listener deprived of the jams. Kinda like listening to Skeletons in the Closet. Great band, though, will continue to collect and support their live acts till i die."
2,A very minor miracle,"I have used the Miracle Mop for years. Apparently the product has been discontinued. Because of the Fuller Brush name, I decided to try this product. I am comparatively, very disappionted. The mophead is small, does not wring out as efficiently, and cannot go into the washing machine because the metal holder remains on the mophead."
3,It's just kind of....There,"I was not a fan of Beautiful Girls. The song got under my skin and made me grit my teeth. So I was not about to go out and buy the CD over that, however I WAS a huge fan of Me Love. I didn't buy this album, but I've heard it a couple times nad it's not awful. There's not any songs (with the exception of Beautful Girls) that I hate, but there's just not really any I love. (The radio did eventually ruin Me Love for me). ""There's Nothin"" & ""That Ain't Right"" are kind of some I catch myself bobbin my head to. I wouldn't suggest buying the album to someone who wasn't a die hard fan, but I mean...if someone gave it to me I wouldn't throw it away."
4,hood rats aint real either,"i am tired of hearing about whether sean kingstons' accent is real or not! who cares? lots of the so called 'hood rat' rap artists ham up their manner of speech to sell records --- and nobody seems to dis them for it. this isnt a super meaningful or musically superior effort- just fun and easy to listen to....makes you want to dance. i enjoy it, although i hate that hammy cover photo."
4,Music,I bought this CD for my grandson as a christmas present and he loves it. He is happy with the product
4,Great!,"Really like it! Keeps my breakouts under control like nothing else I've ever used, rinses easily & leaves my skin feeling clean & not dry."
5,a dastardly smashing wistfulness flung from the hills,Ever wonder what Menudo would be like if they killed off all the members and replaced them with a young female tiger tamer in shellfish heels carrying an acoustic guitar and a dinner roll? Ever loose an appendage in a motel hottub drain? Ever enjoy the delightful sway of a LLama ride after an endless dawn of precoital expectational arguments? Well you will once again when you listen to this album. Buy one for the servants too!
2,pleasant after a good beating...,I found this CD on a bus from Philly to NY. I took it home and listened to it and then tried to find the rightful owner so I could pummel him. I was unable to do this so I brought it to my local police precinct. Five hours later my door was kicked in and three cops beat me with my own toaster oven until I lost conciousness. It has a certain noisy intense quality...
1,Mega-disappointing,"I agree completely with ""one beeg hawaiian music fan's"" review.I loved their first CD, every song, and it plays continuously on the car stereo. I also love ""Instrumental Peace"", with Barry on his own.This one is just awful. The choice of songs lack any coherence or theme. They don't hang together as a unit, nor move smoothly or logically from one to the next. The instrumentation is flat and unimaginitive, unlike the first CD, where every note sang.It's a mish-mash of whatever was in the cupboard - and the cupboard was pretty bare.It's the first time I've fast-forwarded past a previously unheard song on a new CD - and I did that on several. The title track is bloody awful. Again, hit the FF button once it got to the speech bits. If I wanted to listen to a speech, I'd listen to a speech, not a music CD.If I could give it less than one star, I would.This one is destined to be used as a drink coaster!Save your money and buy something else."
3,"Book club choice, not mine","Had it not been a book club choice I wouldn't have finished reading it. Although well written, It was just too slow for me and I didn't like the main character's passivity. Others in the group did enjoy the book, however."
1,Lame,"I don't get it. I watched this numerous times on Comedy Central and haven't laughed once. They try too hard to be funny. Everyone on the show sounds like they are high off thier ass and the 'squigglevision' crap is annoying. I suppose some episodes could be funny, but the majority I have seen weren't at all.Hell I thought the same thing as Aqua Teen, and they ended up being moderately funny, so I guess there is hope. Im not going to run out and buy this though.I'd rather stick to the greats such as Family Guy (#1!), Futurama, The Critic, and everything else.This is almost as lame as Duckman (another non-laugher), and Courage the Cowardly Dog."

2,Review of Oxford Dictionary of English,This book sucked monkey s*** balls. I would recommend this as a bed time book for complete bores. It SUCKS!!!!!
1,Helps a bunch,this book is really cool because I can look up any word I want to whenever I want and my dad thinks its cool to so it really helps with my school work!
3,Dictionaries,I believe that dictionaries are helpful to children because the children can get to understand what the words mean and should be able to write a sentence or even more. Students and adults should be able to understand the meaning of the word
5,Dictionary,This was a very helpful book and this h we lose with homework a lot. I hope this book helps everyone else too.

1,I just flipped through the page,Uh well I didn't really look at the meanings but I think I might need them soon. :) Ps I'm awesome
1,overpriced!,i am sure this is a great dictionary but i would never pay $50 for a dictionary. this is an absoulute rip off!
1,The best online dictionary,This was amazingly the best virtual English dictionary.it gave me so much information about words and their meanings I really enjoyed it!
4,My review,As always the Oxford Dictionary has a class and this one has no exception. The explanation for each word is very informative.
3,Tangled,Once UPON A TIME THERE WAS a new flower that can actually glow there WAS THIS old woman searching for something and she found this flower that can heel HER she sang a song and she got younger BUT the guards came and they saw a flower and they brought it to the QUEEN who was sick so they put the flower in the water and mixed it up THE QUEEN drank it up and she had a new baby and she felt better again the baby had glowing hair everything was perfect but that night that old woman came up to their castle and she cut that baby's hair and that woman became old again the suddenly SHE took the baby than her real parent woke up and saw that old woman took the baby that old woman kept that baby in the tower when that baby grew older that woman told her that it is dangerous out there and I DO NOT WANT YOU TO GO OUT THERE OKAY THAT LITTLE GIRL SAID YES MOMMY I will not go out there 5 years later that little girl became a teenager and she cleaned up the house while her mother go out and get some food
1,About Oxford dictionary of english,The Oxford dictionary of English is good because if you have it when you go to a place and you have to look up something you can use this to look up your information you can find it easily
4,Very helpful,This dictionary was veryHelpful to me and probably very helpful to others to! I will never forget this dictionary!
2,"Great brush head, not so great handle","The brush head itself is just the size I was looking for in a barbeque brush and works fine. The handle is also the right length. However, I could not tell from the picture that the handle is metal, not solid. Using a handle that is essentially a piece of thick wire bent in two feels uncomfortable and unbalanced in your hand. It also makes unwieldy to use. If I had known the handle was actually a metal loop instead of a solid material, I would have never purchased it. Because I like the brush head, I just wrapped the handle in duct tape. Not a perfect fix, but better than the original design of the handle."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"I have really bad dark circles under my eyes, I think its just genetics and was hoping this would work but I really dont see to much of a difference. i think it would work for someone whos dark circles arent as bad or just have the puffy eyes."
5,Find it!!,"Just hit the web and find a copy. Don't pass GO, etc., etc. Be prepared for a hard read, be prepared to think (and not to think - see the book) but read it, shoot a lot, re-read it, repeat until you think you know more than Brian Enos. That won't happen, btw."
4,Excellent,Essential reading if you want to know both the mindset and physical skills required to excel in this great sport
1,Stock photography plus text,"If you are looking for a gift for a father-to-be, please don't get them this book. The photographs of fathers within this book aren't the men interviewed. The images are from stock photography - many images of men looking surprised at a baby. Give something meaningful instead."
2,Not the best for the Money,"I'd like to set the record straight about these speakers because part of why I purchased them was because they had good reviews. I bought these for a stereo setup to listen to music 90% of the time and to watch movies the rest of the time. I'm something of an audiophile with a Pro-Ject turntable and a Harmon-Kardon receiver. I listen to a wide variety of music from jazz to hip hop to punk and heavy metal on vinyl, cds and mp4s. I will say these speakers do have a lot of bass with the dual 8inch woofers, but it sounds muddy and clumsy. The highs are distorted and the mids are weak. the overall sound of these lacks warmth. I ended up going with Polk Monitor 60s. For only a little more dough these are a world of difference.The JBL speakers look ridiculous too. They look kinda cool in the picture but once you see them in person they are huge (10 x 40 x 15""), the silver looks like imitation aluminum, and the silver grilles are really cheap."
5,I loved the album. It's a mix of so many pleasing styles.,"I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys music in the traditional styles of Springstenn, Dylan and Hootie with some real blues mixed in for good measure. I keep finding myself putting on the cd over and over because the songs really grow on you. That to me is always the sign of a great album. This is the type of CD that you keep hearing the songs in your head untill you have to put it on again. Fine production qualities also that are very pleasing to the ear."
4,BERRY SWEET FUN!,"I enjoyed this DVD as much as the other SS DVD's, especially because we get to meet Peppermint Fizz and her pet lizard Cola Chameleon, potential villains.But in this DVD, Angel Cake becomes a bad sport because she isn't playing the games as well as the other kids so she throws a few temper tantrums and acts like a diva. That was a tad annoying to me. Other than that, I would have given it 5 stars."
1,Useless study guide,"Unless you know absolutely nothing about the US, the world, and/or English grammar, don't even think of buying this book. The book has not been updated for new test format, and has quite a few ?printing/editing? mistakes. Just use the study guide from FSOE website & any English grammar book to prepare."
4,Welcome to the real world,"The quality is not terrific and there are problems--and this stuff is in the public domain. However, this is about the only way to get this material and it is of considerable interest for animators and cultural historians.Before DVD people didn't ""restore"" films much and before DVD and video tape (an era I remember too well) access to just about everything was limited to the point of just not there for you. We've gotten a bit spoiled and our expectations on media material are way too high; unrealistic even. If this material was restored the DVD would cost an exorbitant amount of money and probably wouldn't exist--restoration is expensive. One of my favorite East German science fiction films was restored by the University of Massachusetts German language department and offered for educational sale only for $150--it was the only way they could justify the expense."
4,Great video!,"I'm not the world's best fitness person, but this video has been great. I purchased a belly dancing video in the past with different instructors, which I enjoyed, but I enjoyed this one much more.I really appreciated Amira explaining why learning the particular moves were great for a woman's body in general and to help the woman's body deal with pregnancy as well as childbirth.The moves are simple enough and explained well enough that even someone who has never exercised could still do them.After doing this video, I felt worked out, but not drenched in sweat. This is an awesome video!"
1,Crap,"No problem with the seller, just the product itself. Came in a package that might or might not have been new, items were dirty and scratched. The thing that's the worse is if you try to clean them with anything other than your hand and some soap, you will scratch the heck out of them and leave swirly marks all over them, fingerprints show up quite vividly. Would not recommend buying this product, cheap, looks and stays dirty, difficult to clean. Did i add after you wash it you cant wipe it down with a paper towel, that will also ruin it. Wash with your hand and dry off with a soft cloth. Good luck to anyone that orders these. They are pretty, but ruined right out of the package. NOT THE SELLERS FAULT THOUGH!!!"
3,a weird shade of white,"Got these today, they are super deep, probably best for gas stoves, and I have an electric one, so they are a bit tall.. Color is a weird shade of white. Wouldnt have bought them if I were to have seen them in person... Not that there is anything srong with them, just not what I wanted."
4,very good story,I bought this after reading Book 1. I am anxiously awaiting Book 3. The fictional characters have well thoughtout personalities and intertwine with the historical period without a hitch.
4,Liked it alot!,This book is a nice mix of historical fact and fiction with a good story line. Characters are detailed. A good read!
3,Wright keyed door entry set,"[...]Service from seller was terrific.Price was terrific.Product appears to be great too.But the instructions for installation left a lot to be desired. I have installed several entry sets before and this one was the most difficult by far! I am remodelling a home and replacing existing door entry systems, etc. I purchased a Kwikset through Amazon and it took fewer than 30 minutes to install. This Wright set took over an hour because of the lousy instructions. Complete steps were omitted in the instructions which meant I had to uninstall and reinstall over and over. It was frustrating and time-consuming and completely unnnecessary. Too much installation effort was wasted in trial and error simply because the instructions were lacking. Every system is different, I know from experience, and this ain't neurosurgery, but this product could be greatly enhanced with more specific instructions!"
3,"Great Singer, but","I remember when Marion was Marian alias Pepe and without a doubt one of the finest of her genre. Her record ings for Capital in the 60's were jazz classics. This recording made in the late 80's is o.k. but regrettably not in the aforementioned class. Perhaps the impact of age and living in the UK have taken a toll as I suspect it would on all of us. Make no mistake the gal can still sing ballads with the best of them; however, the renderings are on the bland side with far too little ""juice & bounce"" which this gal used to exude. Unlike the Cap sessions when she sizzled with the great backup band with D. Cavanaugh producing, the Brits apparently are not prone to the ""juice & bounce"" which this gal is capable of delivered. Is she still alive and recording?"
2,Not an encyclopedia,"Unfortunately this book lacks of a good editor who can classify in the design all of the different cases and link them together so the reader can browse through them.An editor could easily underline the basic facts of a term and spell it out to the reader.For example, there should be colored textboxes for to distinguish the credible facts from the misssing information.Moreover, under famous cases like ""Roswell"" he offers little accounting of the event blaming ufologist literature. I can hardly believe that the most famous case of a ""UFO landing"" has little material, while he describes the Hill case (less witnesses) in such a detail.This book is too expensive for what it offers. It promises an organised reference of UFOs and instead is difficult to read and in some occations it lacks of information."
3,It's ok,"does not work very well for me, maybe my paint is too far gone? who knows.I could not tell a difference after using this product."
4,Good CD,I am extremely familiar with Happy Louie's music. This CD is a collection of his early music. The recording equiptment back then was not as good as the technology that we have today. That is the only reason that I gave this CD a 4 star rating. But the quality of his music and singing is truly a 5 star. His Polish vocals are wonderful. He is very energetic with his music and performances on stage. His energy shows in all of his music. If you like Polish Polka music this is a good CD to have in your collection. Any of Happy Louie's Polka band CD's are a wonderful addition to add into your Polka music collection!!
4,Tell your friends about this book,"Steven Rangoussisis has introduced himself as an author with enormous potential in his first work. ""Blood and the Imperial Purple"" is a thoughtful and sensitive fiction placed as the foreground in front of a beautifully textured historical background.I savored each page of this book on my way to Rome on a business trip, and appreciated the author's attention to detail. It made my trip to some of the local sites to which he referred even more magical and mysterious.I am anxious to read Steven's next offering."
4,Intimate Reflection,"Although not an avid reader of poetry but I have dabbled in fine literature such as Shakespears Sonnets, love poems of Browning and spiritaul inspirations of the Psalms. This book on peotry has given a real life perspecitive of love, pain, understanding and a connection to inner-personal feelings that helps one relate to what the author is writing about and makes you feel as if you are almost there with them at the same time going through it all."
3,"A light, entertaining read with a ""you are there"" feel","Even though we're now in the era of comprehensive ""making of"" documentaries that accompany so many movies on DVD, it's still fun to pick up a good old ""behind the scenes/making of"" movie tie-in book from time to time. Carl Gottlieb's updated edition of his ""The Jaws Log"" is a good example of how entertaining such a book can be. It's nothing spectacular, just a solid, anecdote-laced account of a movie now famous for its production horror stories. Lots of new footnotes (about 20 pages worth) update the reader on what's happened since the book's original 1975 debut as well as providing further details not in the earlier edition, but it should be said that the original 1975 manuscript was still pretty candid for a merchandising tie-in."
5,THE GREATEST!!!!!!!!!,"I simply cannot imagine how anyone could not absolutely love this wonderful book. The love story was beautiful and engrossing, the plot was suspenseful and well thought out and the characters were to die for. I am an avid reader of science-fiction, fantasy, and romance novels and this book captured elements of all of them. I have read this book more than a dozen times and love it each time. Anyone who likes romance and science-fiction will absolutely love this book!!!!"
3,"Good Book, Deceptive Marketing","The reviews for the first edition of this book, and its software, were very positive. I bought it for my kids shortly after the second edition came out. This edition of the book is useful, but the software--supposedly the key to making the book work, since it is supposed to allow you to actually design games as you go along--is advertised on the back of the book as being unlimited, and it's not unlimited. It's a demo that expires after several uses. Supposedly there's an unlimited version on the author's web site; good luck finding it.Followup: I'm told the URL for the software is at www.maneeshsethi.com/BlitzPlusDemo.exe but I haven't used it yet to see if it's completely unlimited, or just has more uses."
2,"To many errors, Good if you know blitz basic and trying to learn blitzmax",There are wayyyy to many errors in the code in this book. I only recommend someone get this if they have the 1st or second edition and know blitzbasic trying to switch to blitzmax as you wont be able to figure out these errors otherwise. It looks as though the Author was in a Huge rush to make a quick extra buck buy releasing a crappy 3rd edition
2,You have to pay to play,"This book is ok if you are not serious about game programming. My biggest issue is that you cannot run the programs from the book on another computer. If you want to do that, you have to log on to their web site and pay a lot of money for it. The fact is that I can get a semi-professional IDE from Microsoft's web page for free. This will compile and create EXEs that I can run on any computer. I can also program in C++ which is the language that almost all video games are programmed in. Microsoft's IDE also has an excellent debugger. If you are serious about game programming, or programming in general, I recommend learning and practicing on the real thing."
1,Fake Programming,"First off, anyone who takes this book seriously, and wants to learn how to ""prgram"" makes me laugh. Go take a course in programming and learn some real language.. Not some Bs language for little kids who want to pretend to make a ""game"". Go buy a book on Visual Basic 6.0 or Visual Basic.net, that is a very good starters language."
1,what is this?!,"The safe I received was marked as new, but what I got clearly was not new or in any new condition. The top left corner of the safe was damaged and rusted enough not to be considered ""new"". When I opened the box the safe was covered in some kind of fine dust. Inside the safe was just gross. The top shelf was covered with brown stains that looked almost like burn marks. I ended up throwing the shelf out just to be safe. There was also a piece of rubber inside covered with some yellow, sticky material. I was so disgusted by the inside I ended up cleaning the entire inside with Lysol and rubbing alcohol. If you do buy this make sure it is truly in new condition."
4,Good Product,This would have been a better rating but there was 2 things broken on the inside of the safe which is keeping this from a 5 star rating. I fixed the clip and the seal that was broken because it wasn't worth returning because of that however I do not like getting things that are broken and looks to me like it was shipped broken.
1,cheaply made broken out of box.,"This product was an extreme let down. Keys fit horribly, much like throw away plastic handcuffs. Electronic aspect didn't work. Repeated tries and multiple 15 minute lockdowns later accepted it was never going to work. Barely got started pealing off large face sticker, before I knew I had to send back. That was going to be next obsticle with this piece of crap.Merry Christmas."
4,"great price, free shipping","perhaps not the greatest safe ever built, but i feel it's adequate and feel quite secure using it. price was right, shipping free. researched, couldn't do better. thanks amazon."
1,where is it,i cannot rate product rec many calls from deliv company now it is my oblig to call them monday the 22please cancel this order i will reorder it again on the 25 thank you skybluepink@optonline.net
4,Honeywell 2077D,"This safe arrived in approximately 10-12 days after I ordered it. It was the perfect size I was looking for. The instructions,keys and shipping slip were all included. I was disappointed that the top left corner of the safe was dented. The damage was very minimal, so I did not bother returning the unit. I was also disappointed that the was no way to secure the safe to the floor. No mounting bolts or holes were provided and no mounting tips were mentioned in the instructions. This is an average safe for average security. I would say it's an entry level product."
1,No keys with safe,"Seems like Honeywell has a huge quality control problem. I am the second person reviewing honeywell safes on this site who received no keys. No master to open it, no keys for after it is progammed. Honeywells manual and their FAQ does not address where the the keys ""should"" be. They also have very poor customer serivce. I emailed them 24 hours ago - no response. They can just take this useless paperweight back at this point.BUY A SAFE FROM ANOTHER COMPANY."
3,Side effects,"I've purchased these in a health store before and never had the side effects I have had with these.They are very tasty, however the side effects- let's just say intestinal, make it very uncomfortable."
4,Great Book for Young Adults,"Helen Frost does a terrific job of writing characters that all young people can relate to. Each character brings a different set of problems to a house where all are accepted and all are welcome. Tender moments prevail as a group of unwanted misfits manage to create a safe haven and family-like home.My only concern would be the man who owns the home. Perhaps we don't learn enough about him to be able to ward off uncomfortable feelings. An older man who allows unwanted teenagers to live in his house without paying rent? Let's hope that our young people know enough not to replicate this scenerio, as we know that this picture-perfect setting is realistically not as innocent."
3,Pretty good fantasy,"Pretty good fantasy movie with an interesting, if not particularly original plot. (This a pretty familiar storyline for readers of fantasy fiction.) A lonely young man falls under the spell of a painting of a young woman. The subject of the painting seems to come to life, steps out of the painting and kisses him passionately. Thereafter he continues to see her alive in the painting and becomes obsessed with obtaining it at the cost of his savings, his job, the friendship of the waitress who falls in love him, and very nearly his sanity.Victor Burke as the young man and Salli Saffioti as the waitress gives nice performances, as do a number of actors in supporting roles. For an independent film the production values are good, although the cinematography is a bit jerky.Not a particularly deep or moving film, it is obviously a labor of love on the part of director Phil Scarpaci and writer Colin Mitchell.Not great, but certainly not bad. Worth checking out."
3,Not a terrific book but not completely terrible.,"This book has some good suggestions but it's definitely not a great book. It really doesn't have much substance to it. What I hate the most about this book though is the obnoxious and condescending tone the author uses. The author speaks as if he knows everything about children and overgeneralizes too much, and furthermore he does so with an obvious arrogance."
1,making the terrible twos terrific,"What a sad idea of parenting. This expert would have us think that nurturing involves abuse (even subtle abuse). Spanking, leaving a baby to scream until he tires and no longer trusts his parent and other power over tequniques will not change the world into a peaceful place but further a divisive culture. We could learn from some of the cultures that practice loving parenting. I certainly do not reccommend this parenting book."
3,"Before you spurge on this, do consider...","I would be warry of spending too many of your hard earned dollars on this book. I am a new fan to Hellboy, and absolutely love Mignola's art. However, the reason I would be heasitant about recommending this art book is that there is very little new art in it. Most of it is just rehashed covers, pages and posters. Probably about 10% of it is stuff that you've never seen before; which in my mind, does not warrant the hefty price tag. If you have all the books in the series then you already have 90% of the art found in this book. The sketches and other doodles that are only in this book can most likely be found floating around the net if you look hard enough for it."
4,Condition,I was very satisfied with the condition of this used book. It was in excellent condition as advertised. One corner of the back cover had a small defect that was hard to detect.
3,"Help for beginners, student or otherwise","The author does a good job of covering a lot of food choices; there's even a section for vegetarians. The handy hints - ""Don't dump grease from cooked meat down the drain! Drain grease into old can and discard when solidified"" - will be a great help, not only to students but to any novice cook out there. The style of the book though, could use a bit of pizzazz, especially since it's audience is 20-somethings who will need visual interest to draw them in. Other than that, this book will help a lot of kids who are feeding themselves for the first time. 50 Ways to Leave Your Mother"
5,About quality,Goods are genuine articles and became brave. + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +
1,CHEAP!!! BEWARE!!,Made in Thailand.I have many other pieces of Le Creuset I absolutely love. This one is CHEAP looking and feeling. DO NOT buy it if you are want the quality Le Creuset pieces.
5,Journey Without Distance,"This is a very concise explanation of how A Course in Miracles was created,a very important read for those ready to begin studying A Course."
3,The One That Has You're So Vain,"I agree with those that have said the only reason for a FP fan to really want this is for the song ""You're So Vain"", I'm really surprised it's so low in price, I am tempted to pay the 7 bucks for one song, but I have all 3 of thier studio Cd's, and for that one song seems strange.Perhaps in the future a better collection of songs also, why ""Bottle In Front Of Me"" is on here I don't know, and only 10 songs it's a poor representation of the band. They might as well put out an essential 2 CD set and put ""You're so Vain"" at the end. Leave off 3 or 4 songs from ""Whipped"", and leave off maybe 1 or 2 from each of the first 2 CD's and there you have it.This one is lacking, even for a band that only put out 3 CD's of studio material."
4,It works,"The copy of this book that I bought was actually given as a free ""examiner's copy"" to someone who sold it to a book buyer to make some fast cash. As far as I can tell though, the only thing that is different is the cover, and for half price, I think thats worth it."
4,Excellent little vice but ...,"First, Amazon forces toy style reviews on this product. I had to agree that I'm over 13 and rate how fun, educational, etc. This is a tool and it is sturdy. There is little or no sloppiness. It fits the Dremel workstation. Very nice except it does not hold 1 1/2"" materials. It comes very close but won't. I had to return it."
1,sent it back,It did not fit my Dremel drill press ( it is an older model - maybe that was my problem
3,A Compelling Read-Emily Parmenter Was a Lonely Kid,"I've read quite a bit of Anne Rivers Siddons literature in the past, and have enjoyed it. This book was a compelling read, yet not her very very best work.Emily Parmenter is a loner for only a 12-year old kid. Having lost her mother when she was very small, she has her 2 brothers and her father who run a Boykin Spaniel dog training business, and don't pay Emily too much attention at all. So Emily is kind of on her own.When Aunt Jenny moves in it helps Emily with another female in the house. But what really changes the picture is the arrival of the enigmatic Lulu Foxworth, who has a powerful personality all her own. Emily isn't too fond of Lulu at first, but it doesn't take long before the two are fast friends, like sisters.Lulu also comes from a wealthy family with a domineering mother and father. She also carries some dreadful secrets that will affect Emily in a not-so-good way."
1,THE DREGS OF SWEETWATER CREEK,"I listened to this book on tape while driving to Los Angeles. The promo said it was a bittersweet story. That does describe some of the characters....some are bitter, others are sweet, but when all is said and done, who cares? The reader, Anna Fields, has a voice that is annoying. Her pronounciation of certain words like ""recipe""......calling it ""receipt"" was particularly aggravating. Do they pronounce the word differently in the Carolinas???The story itself is a real ""soaper"" and the only really interesting character is Elvis the Boykin spaniel. (He seems to use his brain which is more than I can say for the humans in the story.)"
3,Unsatisfying,This book started out great but then left me hanging. The author never goes into detail. What was Buddy's illness? What happened to Lulu? I was very unsatisfied with this book. I would have like a better finish for the Lulu character. A better understanding of what Yancey was all about. Where did the mother go?
2,Where Was The Editor?,"I usually like Siddon's work but Sweetwater Creek was just TOO 'way out there' for me. The descriptions were enchanting for the first 100 pages, then I felt like I was drowning in adjectives.The editing was pathetic. Contradictory statements, poor research. Since when is a dolphin a FISH?????Glad I got this one from the library and didn't waste my $$$."
4,A Spellbinding Yarn Of Modern Naval Tactics and Combat.,"The second in the Amanda Garrett series spins a great tale of daring do. Great plots and sub-plots, characterization, and informed Naval warefare doctrine. One of the best I have read in the last year."
3,Night Of The Creeps,"Movie is really not that bad. However it does contain a classic line. ""Hey Girls, theres good news and bad news. The good news is your dates are here. The bad news is that their dead."""
4,Yummy Bunnies but messy little fingers!,"How can you go wrong with Annies? The only thing I didnt expect with the white cheddar is that they have a cheesy powder on them that the regular cheddar does not. It tends to be messy for little ones, leaving them with sticky messy finger. Next time I think I will just buy the regular ones...but these do taste great!!!"
2,pretty bland,I did not like these crackers. The cheddar flavor was barely there and there was a weird aftertaste.
5,good book,"This is a used book when I bought it. but for me, it is perfect, defenetly like a brand new book. They said damage cover,but I cant find what and where is the damage. Its perfect.The book itself gives an inspiration. the shipping is fast enough."
5,Enchanting,Deb is a teacher at my daughter's school. She has helped create an inspiring learning environment for all the children to learn in.This book will help you allow new ways for your child's imagination to blossom.
5,speedy service,"Wow, you order the book one day and the very next day, the book is sitting in your mailbox. Prompt and speedy service - I like it. I look forward to doing business with you again."
5,"Wonderful, moving book","This is, in my opinion, the best book that Joy Fielding has written, and I've read them all. Truly a piece of wonderful fiction that will be as poignant today as far into the future. One of the very few books that has made me cry."
3,"Mored dependable than running on batteries, yet no power-on function offered.",I was expecting to get power on/off automated as well as forget about buying batteries once a month. Be aware that radar will not fire up on its own and requires driver intervention after car is parked for several hours. Cord is good to prevent from powering off the Solo 3 radar should batteries go dead. Mute button on power plug is nice feature. Manufacturer should consider adding a menu configurable function to enable/disable power auto-on.
3,textbook,I ha to get this for my undergrad class. It was okay. The issue I dont like is the price. most of these you can get for free now. and they book changes so often that when you want to sell it again it is outdated. I wish this book would stay constant for at least 5 years. and not change almost every year
5,GREAT!,"I'm a total amateur that's starting to understand the way the game is played, instead of just swinging a club on the golf course. I wanted to buy some shoes, and these are perfect for someone like me. Good grip, great quality, stylish to boot! I would highly recommend it also because it has options for wider sizes for someone with great big duck feet like me!"
2,bad fit,"The order arrived on time and in good shape. The shoes look good(construction, etc). The problem is fit. I ordered 91/2w and the shoes were actually narrow. Unable to wear them and returned to company."
4,Nike Black Golf Shoes,Great looking and really good feeling shoes. They are stable and comfortable. It's like playing in sneakers with the look of playing in tour shoes.
3,golf shoes,"a good looking shoe but not to be recommended to buy unseen and untried. For the size on the shoe, it is SMALL and therefore a v tight fit. I would not buy this brand again via the internet"
2,Disappointing for Atwood fans,"I am an avid Margaret Atwood fan, and thus felt compelled to finish reading this book in the hope that it would somehow be as emotionally provocative as are many of her other works. Yet I felt incredibly disappointed in this earlier work of hers. Although her writing is interesting and the symbolism is vivid, it feels like Margaret Atwood is still searching for her literary voice and style. This novel seems to represent her search for her writing style, as it flips between using poetic symbolism and diary-style narratives. Quite disappointing- and I recommend to anyone reading this as their first Atwood attempt, to read another of her much greater works (i.e. Bodily Harm, Alias Grace, Robber Bride, Wilderness Tips) to truly experience the power of her writing."
1,Junk,I purchased this product prior to my current HP cartridge running out. When I installed the Verbatim cartridge I got the error message 54.1 Remove sealing tape from the cartridge. Of course I had already done this. Since these are remanufactured cartridges the sealing tape has been retrofitted by Verbatim. Verbatim expected me to pay for return shipping and would replace it after they received the cartridge. I don't believe that I should be required to pay the return shipping and then wait for a cartridge. Verbatim cartridges are not the cheapest but rank right down with the quality of the bargain basement remanufactured cartridges.
1,Piece of Junk,I purchased this for my K-8 music classroom. I liked that it had the record player because I still have some older pieces of music that are on record that I haven't been able to afford to replace. The CD player rotation stopped working 13 months after we purchased the it. The tape deck dubbing function quit after 14 months when the recording deck started eating the tapes. The warranty had expired by the time these things happened so we (the school district) are out of luck.The sound was okay when the thing worked. It didn't have the ability to be turned up very loud.I'm now using a Sony CD player that I won in 1998. It works better than the piece of junk Emerson we purchased.
4,Veggie Tales Rock!,"Larry is a gucci pucci mama papa soft soft pillow head. veggie tales are so cool, funny, silly billygoaty, ahwww and soo cutey booty, dooty, lo loo goo gee. Get this for everyone, not just kids you guys! Okay, bi bi."
4,So you didn't like it....what have you produced lately?,"Man, these reviewers really didn't seem to like this single. Makes we wonder why they would ever choose to own it..? For the instant gratification of disliking it again and again?I, myself, happen to be a fan. I like it. Ok, so it's not the Joshua Tree. Let a Joshua Tree be a Joshua Tree, and quit subjecting yourself to things you don't enjoy. We can do without your public servicing.Go review an Usher CD. -js"
4,Good stuff,Slightly different than the album versions. I prefer the HTDAAB Collector's Edition version of Fast Cars.
5,Excellent folowon for the series,"This stands alone but I recomend readingTouch the Dark (Cassandra Palmer Series, Book 1)first. Cassandra is the Pythia who is in charge of policing the time line and preventing massive changes or paradoxes. The plot starts out kind of liner but winds up with some good twists. The characters are well done and compelling. There is quite a bit of sly humor; I liked the finger sandwiches and the illegal aliens. One nicely done errotic scene central to the plot.Well thought out and consistent overall although the author introduces a lot of different magic and critters she is so far consistent.I would recommend reading the first book first; otherwise there is a lot to soak up in this book. These books are rich in complexity and imagination; with lots of interesting critters, not just the relatively pro forma vampire/were.Excellent reads highly recommended!"
3,um... I bought the wrong book,"I actually read this over a year ago when it first came out. I had forgotten the cover and no longer actually had the book in my possession. anyhow, I should have been reading the sequel only it's not out until next month or so."
1,Exhausting,"I think this author needs to review some principles of writing books. She has so much action in her books that you just get tired of jumping from one disaster to another. She fails completely on drawing a vivid picture of her characters. At the end of the book I have a bunch of names in my head and not a single defining characteristic sticks so I can get a true feel for them. The reviewer says nonstop thrill ride but even a good roller coaster has some slow places so you can catch your breath. Long descriptive passages of place and character provides these breathing spaces, something Ms. Chance does not excell at to put it mildly. Unfortunately her lack of desciption makes these characters and her story a forgettable jumble of exploding noise without much entertainment being offered.It's clear Ms. Chance has a good imagination but she very much needs some help polishing her writing skills."
3,"Not Book 2, but Part 2","I was not a fan of the first book mainly because of the quality of the writing, although the story line seemed fresh and original. In this book I have the opposite issue - the writing was better and less awkward, but it was the plot I had issue with. This book continues from where the last one left off and pretty much consists of the same plot - Cassie running for her life and going back in time to save people. To me there is nothing distinguishable between the first and second book (kind of like the first two Halloween movies). While I enjoy all of the magical creatures and objects Chance has created, the story really didn't keep my interest this time around. Cassie is a good heroine-even though she does not want the job she manages to save a lot of people. But I am really disappointed in the romance. I think there was a lot of potential there but it kind of fell flat. I really wanted to like this series, but I think I'm giving up."
2,boring,Only read it because I had bought it. I was disappointed in the first book in the series and was hoping this second book would be better but it wasn't. Lame.
4,Good but disjointed,"We have enjoyed watching these movies, but at times it can be disjointing, as the format of the director is to jump back and forth in time as the movie is shown... sometimes it loses the thread and the ""moment"" when the plot is not smoothly progressing"
3,first time ever disappointed with MJQ,"I'm old, really old, so you can believe I've loved the MJQ since my prime. I even went to see them in person, in their dotage (not mine). But this effort is SO not like them, so disconnected from the original, the melodies, storyline, characters that it should bear a different title altogether."
4,"Powerful and haunting, yet delicate....","This beautiful melody will stay in my mind forever! I was very impressed with the material on the whole soundtrack. This was a supremely divine written score. Jarre masters the orchestral elements...from the twitter of the piccolo to the driving tympany runs - this is an excellent work of musical art. He uses variations to the main theme nicely. It is mesmerizing and entertainingly majestic. I felt like a king listening to this.So...why only 4 stars? The transfer of this masterpiece to CD was done poorly. I had to turn up my stereo very loud just to hear it. With more volume, comes more background noise and air distortion. Not sure if it was just my copy, but that bugged me. I will probably exchange this CD for a new one and hopefully not have the same issue.Anyone else had this same problem? Please drop me a line."
2,Corny farcical tale.,"The story of an undercover cattle association detective with the name of Peter Piper which pretty well ruins the story to begin with, there is no doubt who the bad guys(rustlers and murderers) are to start with but the law can't act without proof positive, these lawmen are dumb beyond reason, of course there is a lovely young lady involved, William Colt MacDonald wrote a lot of novels and did film writing for the old western movies of the 30s and 40s, along with creating the three mesquiteers which John Wayne among others starred in, the story is just too corny and unrealilistic, try Ernest Haycox or Luke Short."
5,cool,"I didnt see this movie , but ewj himself is best hero in the world i was watching this cartoon in 1997 (i think).I am 13 now but i still remember him.This guy is BESTESTEST in whole universe(and further)!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Fun but breakable,"We got it as a prop for Halloween for our 2 year old son (going as Chucky). It served its purpose well in that regard, but it's not very durable. It didn't last long after that."
5,I love it!,This is the best CD ever! Hackers has the best music I've heard in a long time. And does anyone know the song that was playing when Kate was on the balcony and Dade was on her computer. And the other song when Dade was hacking and discovering about the worm and the virus. And the other song at the end when everyone was hacking into Ellingson and the booths were spinning. Just those three songs. And buy the soundtrack!!!
5,Awesome CD!,"I dont get it-whats with these negative reviews? This cd is great! I ordered it 2 months ago and have listened to it many times. Some songs are very exciting, and ""Escape"" is so beautiful, as is ""wont let you fall"" by Fergie.I highly recommend this cd."
4,"Cracked after a couple of months, but another is on its way","I like this baster a lot - I'm not totally sure what to look for in a baster but it's easy to use, comes with a handy cleaning brush, and seems sturdy enough. The other day, however, while I was roasting a chicken, it cracked up the side. Small cracks, not a full break. It still works to some extent. More importantly, I called Zyliss and another is on its way. Great customer service (provided it arrives)."
3,Zyliss 50510 Angled Baster,"I just received my order and this baster was an item I really needed. I ordered four kitchen items so they all fell under the ""purchase four and only pay for three items."" The baster was my free item because it cost the least. It is supposed to have two detachable tips; one an angled baster tip and the other an injector tip. My unit never came with a baster tip. I think I can still use it. You do get what you pay for! Regardless, this is a nice baster. I especially like the brush that comes with the unit."
3,Timeline issues,"This book is based somewhere mid season two of the show, however it lacks any mention of Jenny Calendar and guessing by how Angel is still good and Xander and Cordelia are still keeping their relationship a secret, she was still a part of the show at the time. Besides from that a strong storyline with an interresting choice for the villan."
3,Nothing to special,"This is far from the greatest Buffy book I've read, and I've read many. The characters sometimes don't seem in tune with the show but they do have their good moments. The author wrote Buffy and Joyce's connection all wrong. He made them seem like they don't have a great mother/daughter relationship like they do on the show.The story was ok. I think the author could of done a better job but it does capture you while reading a couple times. The fight scenes are well written so that's a plus.Overall, this book is in average. If you have read lots of other Buffy books this wont be the best. This the first Buffy book this author has written so that could be a reason. But I hope he continues because he could get better. I mean, remember Nancy Holder's and Christopher Golden's first Buffy book, Halloween Rain? What a mess."
1,Liberal Revisionist Relativism Hiding Behind a Collar,"Liberal, self-justifying philospohy disguised as ""theological"" scholarship with an inflamatory title designed to generate sales. It must be killing Spong watching 100's of millions of faithful Christians feeling more centered on our united faith with John Paul's passing eternal life with Christ (which Spong says dosn't exist) and the joy of a new orthodox Pope ..., while the empty theology of relativism and revisionism withers away.Spong and his message are like old Lawrence Welk reruns - tired relics of a hyppie generation that no one takes seriously anymore. File this book in the dust bin which such stellar titles as ""Earth in the Balance"" and ""Will - G. Gordon Liddy."""
1,A New Part of the Canon for the Spongian Sect,"The doctrine of the Spongian religion adds a new book. Spongianism is just louder, more liberal Unitarianism; built on dead Episcopalians' money and wearing a purple shirt and collar to look ""ministerial."" 1 star doesn't mean one shouldn't read this book. Its a wonderful treatsie on why liberals and particularly the NE and left coast are so out of step with normal American values, and on this point quite valuable. Just take a couple of doses of Pepto Bismol and have a ""comfort bag"" handy while reading."
1,I havn't read a word from this book..,"I havn't read a word from this book. But still can safely see from the author's claims of a ""Married Jesus"" and a ""Gay Paul""that this is a book based less on Facts and more on speculation."
1,A Revisionism Crusade,"All the editorial reviews predictably sing Spong's praises as a visionary, persecuted in his own time like all the great prophets. Spong's liberation and revisionist theology continues in this latest work, only with the added theology of ""Eco-Justice."" The bishop also continues his self-portrayal as some pioneering martyr, struggling for a reformed church. In actuallity this reformation is nothing more than he and the ""Jesus Seminar"" carving up the scriptures like some grizzly Halloween pumpkin - picking and choosing which verses to believe from 20 centuries away like a group of bittys sorting through beads at a swap meet."
3,Background Hiss,"The phone had a background hiss, and while not overwhelming, it was worse than the ten year old 900 mhz Panasonic phone it was to replace. The range was not as good either."
2,"pachmayr pre-fit decelerator recoil pad,ruger red lable wood","this product is not direct-fit in my opinion.the fit did not match my stock ,nor. did the screw pattern match my gun.there was a need to plug orignal screw holes in stock and re drill for new pad."
2,Wages of Sin lacks depth of good true crime book,"As we all know, there is more to a good true crime book than interviewing the main characters and summarizing what they had to say. This book read like a ping pong game, going back and forth from each of the two main characters. In depth research into the crime, the why's and how's, and the psychological profiles of each person involved could have made a profound difference and provided great insight where there was none."
2,Not the best I've ever read........,"After I finished reading the book I knew less then when I started it. For some reason the author portrays Stephanie Martin as a sweet girl gone bad. Well, she went so bad that it is hard to believe that there wasn't some kind of abuse going on in her family. We never find out the real reason they killed Michael Hatton and the Author admits we probably will never know. I think Stephanie might have orchestrated the crime. Maybe she was mad that Michael Hatton didn't pay attention to her, or maybe she just really wanted to see what it felt like to kill someone. Who knows?, and reading this book won't help."
5,Mind Blowing book,"I rate the book highly on almost all counts, especially:- comprehensiveness (some books ignore cleansing techniques, mudras, bandhs, spiritual areas, and some even ignore pranayama - this book covers all these areas as comprehensively as a book should)- detail - would help if this is text is the constant companion of a yoga practitioner - the latter can read, re-read, and re-read many sections of the book and learn new things every time and integrate them into the practice- spiritual orientation - correctly followed the book would help practitioners gain deep spiritual awareness (explains chakra focus during asanas)- progression - the book begins with very basic practices and progresses to complex practicesThoroughly recommended - however, a book cannot replace the guru"
2,Creative Mistake,"The speakers are decent for the price, but I suggest that you buy other speakers if you are looking for bass.The sub-woofer was built like junk. As a result the sub produces bass like junk.The wired-remote that this product comes with has two dials (1 for volume and 1 for bass).The bass dial can go up to 9, however as soon as you pass 4 the speaker begins to rattle.I like my bass in music, but the rattling the sub makes muffles out all the bass, including the rest of the speakers.I gave this set of speakers 2 stars, because the mid/high ranged satellite speakers produce ample sound.I recommend buying another system."
5,Another great night with Louis C.K.,"I love this guy. I'm not married with kids, but in watching his act, I think I get a good feeling for what it might be like. He's a good storyteller, but his comedy works because he doesn't pull any punches. No word or concept is off limits if its funny and a least a little truthful, PLUS he's the butt of much of his comedy which you need so you don't hate the guy.If you're already a Louis CK fan, watch this because its just as funny as anything else you've seen by him.If you haven't watched a Louis CK routine, but you're not easily offended and like raw comedy, you'll dig this.Highly recommended."
3,Louis C.K.: Chewed Up,"Not his best stuff..me and my fiance recently saw him live in Portland, OR and he was exhaustingly hilarious....this DVD, however, was a bit of a let down"
4,Hilarious!,"Any fan of comedy and a good laugh should definitely check this one out, I guarantee you will love it!"
4,memories,All I have to say is it brings back memories of my childhood days listening to the radio. Great lyrics you can understand.
5,Great CD!,"Love listening to this CD - The music is great and that voice just gets you, whew! Not a bad song in the bunch. Can't wait for the next one!"
2,NO NO don't read,"This book is cute and has great illustrations. It even has a cat as the main character, my child's favorite thing in the world. But the curious cat is being scolded on every page. This was a frightening message for my child and she cried after the second reading. I would not recommend this book for toddlers as they may be confused by the ""NO NO"" on every page."
5,My 2 year old loves this book!,"Being a toddler, my daughter likes saying ""No, No, Jo!"" and she feels like she has some control over her world (and she's ""reading""). The Sam-Jen-Jo situations are very typical for her age group (selecting socks, brushing teeth, painting), and the pictures are colorful. (Plus we have a kitten ourselves to relate Jo's antics to!) A child who is testing out his/her independence would enjoy this book. It's also short enough for a parent to read over several times without getting too annoyed with the repetition that toddlers so love!"
4,Good 5th Doctor Music,This CD is good. Has the 5 doctor Opening and closing Theme and as the music form The 5 Doctors and the Caves of Androzani. If you find this CD get it! Great for a Doctor Who CD colection
4,Good book to take to Las Vegas,"This is a good book to take with you to Las Vegas. The recommendations, coupons, etc. are well worth the price of book."
5,las vegas casino book,This book is filled with coupons and advice on gambling in Vegas. It was worth buying.
1,Bad,This was the worse book I ever bought. The pages are falling out because of bad binding. The contents are very poor. Casino's that I know are not in the book or not accurate. Very Very poor
3,Past books were better,"This was okay, but some of the discounts we used from the last book were either missing or so much less that the book might not be worth it. The buy one get one free buffet at the Rio is now just 5 dollars off, that was the killer for me."
2,"expired coupons, little information for tourist","this book sounds great, but then you find that the coupons are expired, there is little information for the tourist and not much more information than one can find just reading a few sites online. this book is definately geared toward those tht gamble or are starting to learn to gamble, not the travel guide that many may think it to be. very disapointed."
1,not worth the money in coupons in vegas,"The information for Las Vegas was good but when you tried to use the coupons they were no good anymore,so it was not the savings in coupons that I had expected."
5,THE BEST RICE!,"We have a favorite sushi restaurant where they serve sticky white rice, and we love it. I used to be able to buy Sticky White Rice, uncooked, at Trader Joe's, but for some reason they no longer carry it. Then I found this brand, Annie Chun's, at my local Ralph's market, and tried it, and it is every bit as good as the rice from the restaurant. It is pre-cooked and ready from the microwave in 2 minutes. But now, for some other unknown reason Ralph's no longer carries it, so I went to Amazon, and of course they have everything, and here it is, at a lower price than at the market! Thank goodness for Amazon for many different reasons..... And yes, sticky white rice has a flavor all it's own; we like to sprinkle black sesame seeds on top of it when we serve it. Try this. You'll love the ease in preparation, and the flavor is wonderful!"
5,Best There Is,"This rice is the greatest. We found it in the supermarket but then couldn't get it again. So we ordered it. It is perfect, easy to use. We hate to be without it! Dee Harris"
1,mislead,"The CD you advertise is not the original group from the 50's.the Jive Bombers from the 50's were Afro american and sang songs, such as Bad Boy and When you Hair has turned to Silver."
3,"Decent for price, expect to buy a bow","The violins are fine construction, but not really set up to play. I had to do some work on the bridge and really drive the pegs in to get them to stick. The sound quality is decent.Unfortunately the bow broke first tension put on it. Tried to use wood glue on it and it can't hold the tension. The hair is decent and takes rosen, but again, broken bows are useless except for oversized batons."
1,Extremely terrible,"This is not worth the money. Period. I don't know who they're trying to fool, but it's not working. Nothing on it works and it takes up space in the closet."
4,Ceiling Fixture,"It was a little smaller than I expected. Still, it seems of good quality in constuction and materials. Overall I am satisfied with the purchase."
4,Highly entertaining!,I spend a few sleeples nights with this book and it brought all my childhood dreams about finding lost civilisations - the author did some serious research although I have feeling that sometimes he got carried on with his own imagination.The parts about Pyramids I find too complicated and - no wonder - he actually continued to writte about them in another book.Sometimes I couldn't follow all the names of Gods anymore and feelt stupid :( but I guess that there is something about his theories after all.I understand that people are sceptical but history showed already that in general people dont always take new theories easily (what to say about how difficult was to admit that the planet Earth is a globe?).I reccomend this book to everyone who is curious and it would definitely bring some new ideas to readers.
3,"Overpriced, better alternatives.","There is a 9 disc Kino collection of David Lean pictures that is a far better value. That collection also includes ""Great Expectations"" and ""Oliver Twist"" (two of Lean's very best) as well as ""Hobson's Choice, ""Madeleine,"" ""Sound Barrier,"" and ""Passionate Friends."" This collection has only one film not included in the Kino collection, the fairly good ""In Which We Serve"" which can be purchased elsewhere. This is not a bad collection of 4 films. However, the Kino collection is a far, far better buy."
2,The cover art was good....,"Weak story, weak art.. I found myself just waiting to be finished with it. It has a meager manga style (story and art) but is lost somewhere in-between. Would have been better having just been completely american or manga. I would probably give it a D+ at best."
2,Illustrator Shames Cartoonist,"This example of Marvel's manga-style diversion disappoints on a grand scale. The beauty of the cover and chapter-break illustrations only serve to emphasize the artistic failings of the cartoonist. In fact the poor quality of the panel art, from inking through color, nearly overwhelmed the little interest that the story-line engendered."
2,Another uninspired tale.,"this book is another story about wolverine showing up somewhere, and killing everything. Add in some of the old cliches of evil twins and ""the best there is at what he does"" and you have a pretty good idea of whats in this book."
1,Made In China,I expected to recieve a good made in the USA brush and ended up with made in Chine. There is a big difference in made in USA brushes vs these.
5,Excellent Choise to iluminated,"This flush celing mount fixture it's moderm, ease to install, excelent finished, and great ilumination, but the package it's poor. i doesn't have any problem whit this but it's a very important issue for the costumer."
1,WOT? Is this for REAL?,"They just get a bunch of people together and ""discuss"" Ya-Yahs? Hey, I have a film of a ticket to their concert that somebody threw away, and I'll sell it for $99.99 OBO..."
5,Better than I thought it'd be!,"When I first started this book I thought it would be something which progressed slowly. But I turned out to be wrong! I wouldn't call it fast paced but once you've started reading, you'll find it's hard to put down. The story-line was easy to follow and it was intresting, which is a very important part. However, I spotted a few mistakes in the spoken German at the beginning, eg. 'Vas'. I am learning German and know it should be spelt 'was'. Don't let this small mistake discourage you from reading such a good book though."
1,Mediocre and unbelievable,"This was a suddenly quiverred, flutterred, weakened talent typically shown by J.K., especially, after he wrote his power-house ""JUST CAUSE""(The only readable one). Like his other books before the only recommended one, there were so many holes and illogic flaws in this leaking story. J.K. needs to be restrained from writing such bad story again like this! Before writing any new novel, please try to get some credits of LOGIC lessons from your community college, OK"
4,A great Eastwood vehicle,"This would make a terrific movie (I don't see too many thrillers coming out of Hollywood anymore). But, they would have to get Clint, since this is clearly who the author had in mind. This is the fourth Katzenbach novel I've read, and it would rank third in terms of scares. Wrong Man and Madman's Tale were truly chilling. But this is his most poignant ending. The supporting characters were well written, but had they been left out, it would've worked just the same, if not better. Still, a good and fast read, a great lead character, and one chapter (where he knows the killer is waiting for him in his apartment) is particularly excellent. It's been a while, I hope we hear from Katzenbach soon...I need a good chiller!"
3,Strength and Weakness,"I have just finished my linear algebra course, we covered up to chapter 7 (out of 9). Here are my opinions.StrengthThe book did quite well on introducing Gauss - Jordan eliminations ,linear transformation and determinant. Concepts were explained in detail.WeaknessBut the subspaces and dimension part was bad. There are no image aid. It felt like you had jump straight into a middle of a chapter.The proofs were rather sketchy. The author skips almost half the steps on each of those proofs. Some problems in the book are quite tricky unless you really know what you are doing. Half of the times, you won't be able to use the example for help. If you get stuck in one problem, chances are that you won't be able to do the rest of them.The rest of the topics such as eigenvalues, orthogonality, least squares are average."
1,the worst math book i have ever used,"this is absolutely the worst math book i have ever come across in my academic career, i feel realy bad for any body taking a linear algebra course with a book from otto....good luck"
1,Terrible,"This book is terrible. The reading sections are so short as to be terse, and they ill-prepare readers for the section problems. In my opinion, Bretscher does not effectively explain the concepts of linear algebra.Furthermore, I rely on answers to odd problems to check my work. Often, they are invaluable guides. In this book, however, the answers in the back are worthless due to their brevity. Moreover, (odd) answers for concept questions or proofs are omitted entirely.Take my advice, spend your [money] on something else!"
1,not well made,these blade are not Dewalt's best representation. terribly made. they brake apart as soon as you start cutting. avoid em
5,Found at last....,How to Play Piano Despite Years of Lessons: What Music Is and How to Make It at HomeAbout thirty years ago my husband got me this book so I could play folk music and other favorite songs on the piano. Up until then all I could do was pick out melodies and get very frustrated. I took lessons for a few years when I was a child but dropped it.Almost immediately I was able to enjoy the piano! Then sometime over the years and many moves I misplaced the book. Recently I described the book to someone and decided to try to find it which I did on Amazon.If you just want to sit at a keyboard of any kind and be able to make music and sing along get this book. You don't even need the years of lessons. The system just makes sense and will let you enjoy the process. I am using it again and it is great!
2,vice improvement,"I am enjoying the cd however I think it could have been done much better. In the beginning of a sentence, the male voice, is strong, but then it goes so low that one cannot understand it nor hear it. I find it fustrating. Also a little more time needs to be allowed for a response from the student."
4,Black Diamond Earrings,Gave them 4 stars because we liked them but they are definitely NOT 1 carat or 1/2 carat each.
2,Excited but then dissappointed...,I was very excited when I found these but when I received them I was dissappointed as the (1) earring had a large inclusion on the surface. Posts were nice and the settings as well. Had it not been for the inclusion in the (1) earring I would have given this 5 stars all the way.I did return the items and re-ordered.I will update as I am VERY excited about these earrings.
3,I had one that was bent and there wasn't as much shine as I was hoping for. I would not have paid full price,I had one that was bent and there wasn't as much shine as I was hoping for. I would not have paid full price
2,Rambling And Forgettable,"This should have been a great book. However, this collection of interviews, essays and writings from Alfred Hitchcock develops into an almost utterly incoherent mess that has no shape and is hard to get into.The editor clearly loves Hitchcock and his work, it's just a shame this love is so poorly expressed. The constantly changing, unconnected 'chapters' will leave you confused and losing interest in finishing the book.However, I endured all the way to the end. Whilst it's nowhere near the satisfying read it should be, there are a few - repeat a few - interesting tidbits of information. But unless you're a die hard Hitchcock fan you're better off avoiding this book."
2,Disappointed,The CD was not from the Original movie scores. It was mostly orchestrated music. Overall I was very disappointed in the CD.
4,"Amazing, a textbook that's easy to understand!","I took a class in Fourier Optics and found this text to be indispensable. It explains everything very clearly and concisely, which is a minor miracle for a text at this level. I didn't have any particular background in optics, and was able to pick this up and understand every word.I do agree with the earlier poster that more 'physical' or graphical representations of concepts would have been useful as I tend to be a visual learner."
2,Fluff and more fluff,"This book is fine if you like innane ego-stroking but that's about it. There is no concrete information about how to actually get started in the business. This might be suitable for a freshman Writing 101 class but not for someone seriously wanting to know how to start making a living off their writing. Fluff, fluff, and more fluff.Not recommended."
3,Good lessons - very bad editor,This book has some great concepts and lessons if you allow yourself to take what works for you and leave the rest. I had a very difficult time letting go of the NUMEROUS editing errors. The author mentions how wonderful of a writer he is towards the beginning. This discredits him with the repeated words and sentences throughout the book. His editor should give him a refund.
3,"Impressive, but not great","I liked Joe Connelly's novel, ""Bringing Out the Dead,"" better than the movie (I read the book first). The movie follows the book pretty well, while leaving out many things, as movies must do (there's a significant amount of time spent in the book talking about the narrator's ex-wife).Connelly creates a gritty, realistic atmosphere surrounding his NYC ambulance driver job. At times there are hints of Chuck Palahniuk, but Connelly has a ways to go before reaching that level. The main character is well-developed, and easy to sympathize with, despite experiencing a problem that most of us will never face; failing to save the lives of his patients night after night. Therein lies the triumph of this novel. I feel like I now know exactly what it's like to be a nightshift ambulance driver."
2,Dark and Depressing,"Having been involved in EMS for over 20 years I thought that Connelly's book would be a welcome and entertaining read. Unfortunately, it was anything but! This story focuses on a burned out, psychotic medic and a host of oddballs who work in the same EMS system. Granted, not all of EMS is uplifting or lights and sirens, but Connelly's story turns the profession into a constant run of hallucinations, drinking bouts and abuses of patients and one ""street person."" If Connelly's character worked for any of the the EMS units I've had the privilege of being associated with he'd have, at the very least, been fired but more than likely he would have been charged with a variety of criminal offenses. Any supervisor worth his salt, and the one in this book was a joke, would have dismissed this ""nut case medic"" the minute he came in and asked to be fired. Don't waste your time with this story....it insults the men and women who work in the real world."
4,An Eye-Opener For The Intelligent Otaku,"As an otaku who pays attention to current events on the news, I can daresay that this anime really brings the power of economics to light. With its interesting tidbits about the financial strategy and its flashy colors, it paints a tale that warns about the daunting strength of money on the world.Though I enjoyed the ride, I personally believed it was too short. There were still a myriad of unanswered questions and I felt that the Financial District universe could be explored even further, allowing for even more gems of beautiful storytelling. Regardless of these setbacks, I highly recommend this anime to anybody who either loves economics or wants a creative tale about the haphazard state of global finances."
4,Awesome series!,"I thought this series was really good. The animation was awesome and the story was well-paced. The premise of the series was very thought-provoking...what is the future worth? Is it OK to sacrifice the future for the benefit of today? Again, a great series that I would recommend!"
1,annoying subtitles,"Funimation decide to burn subtitles into not only DVD but also Blu-Ray discs. So, it is not possible to erase subtitles from player. I love this animation, but burned subtitles spoiled it."
3,b-movie that admits it,"a capsule full of killer slugs escapes an alien ship and falls onto 50's suburbia while a patient from a mental institution has escaped killing 4 guards with an axe.30 years later 2 dorks unleash a man from a cryogenics lab as a practical joke,not knowing that they are reviving the man who was infected with the killer slugs.Obviously this is a b-horror film but it isn't all that bad.What makes it work is that it admits to being a bad b-movie with lines like,""is this a crime scene or a bad b-movie?"",and showing Plan 9 From Outer Space on the tv.The movie is hilarious.After blowing off the head of a girls boyfriend and torching the corpse with a flamethrower in order to kill the killer slugs the kid says handing her the shotgun,""here hold this,it'll make you feel better."" sometimes b-movies work and this one isn't that bad.if you like b-horror movies 80's style,than i'd have to recommend this,at least for the laughs."
2,WTF?,Seriously I can't even understand this. There is such a thing as trying too hard to be artistic. What else can I say?
3,"An imaginative, albeit amateurish, debut.","Scott has a good mind and he writes about scientific matters without condescension. However, he indulges in overwriting and purple prose, using many images such as ""an avalanche of unopened mail,"" and others that are far worse. With proper editing, Scott can put his fertile imagination to good use in his next novel. On the plus side, his dialogue is OK and some of his characters are entertaining, but he uses the stereotypes for Orientals that are so insulting: The beautiful and spunky Chinese spy who is tough as nails but is looking for a solid and hunky guy. The horrible Chinese villain who tortures and mutilates his victims for fun. Scott has talent but he must learn to harness it and strive for a more realistic writing style and fewer stereotypes."
4,HAUNTING.......RIVETING..........I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!!,THE PREVIOUS REVIEWERS WHO GAVE THIS BOOK LESS THAN THE 4 STARS THAT IT DESERVES REALLY DIDN'T READ THIS BOOK AT ALL!!! I NORMALLY DON'T READ 'PARANORMAL' TYPE BOOKS BUT FOR SOME WEIRD REASON THIS ONE SUCKED ME IN WITH THE VERY FIRST PAGE....YES!!! I LOVED IT!!! DO GHOSTS REALLLY EXIST??? IS THIS REALLY BASED ON TRUE SCIENCE??? WHO KNOWS???? READ THIS AMAZING BOOK...I DARE YOU TO START IT AT NIGHT AND NOT CONTINUE ON UNTIL DAYBREAK!!!! I LOVED THE SURPRISE ELEMENT IN THIS BOOK AND WAS GLAD THAT IT HADN'T BEEN MENTIONED IN ANY OTHER REVIEW AS THAT CHOICE TIDBIT WAS AN ADDED ELEMENT TO THIS NON-STOP ACTION BOOK!!! I HOPE TO SEE THESE VERY INTERESTING CHARACTERS IN FUTURE BOOKS AND I TRULY HOPE THAT WE WON'T HAVE TO WAIT LONG!
5,Do You Believe In Ghosts?,"Have you ever been a skeptic about whether ghosts exist or not? After reading this book, it will make you think about the possibilities of science research. This book was very entertaining and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout most of the book. The way the author builds suspense is quite genius, and the plot creates questions in your own mind of what ifs. Even though the book is fiction, it makes you wonder about the craziness of others who want to make an impact on the world and what they might do to be successful!"
2,"A bold idea, spoiled by awful writing","Ghosts in the machine: a tempting theme for a writer of thrillers, but hard to work into the no-nonsense world of medicine. The author might have pulled it off with imaginitive writing, but sadly his skills in this department are woefully lacking. As a result it never really rises above being silly. I suspect a pitch for Hollywood along the lines of 'Fallen'. But it's not even that good. I'm slowly coming to the conclusion that thriller writers who can really write are depressingly rare."
4,Almost perfect. Some leakage,"This stopper is almost perfect. It allows a very slow leak in the sink, but works pretty well overall. I'm happy with it."
1,Beware of of the Black finish!!,The matte black disposer flange & stopper look beautiful in my blanco black sink but within 6 months the black coating started to chip off. I would not purchase one with the black coating again. I will purchase the stainless steel insinkerator flange & stopper since they work well & are simple to use.
5,Built tough...,I definitely got more than I was expecting...this wire wheel is a monster and tough as a tank..expensive but worth the money.
4,Good quality,"Nice and wide for my 8 inch grinder, make sure your grinder can take one this wide, it just cleared mine..........look at your spec sheet before ordering"
3,pleasure / paradise,"the title track by pleasure gardens are actually 'Badfinger' under a different name [billygibbons.com] this was recently discovered by a fan of Badfinger. It was recorded during this time period. (mid/late 60`s) this track was featured on a london promo package to promote the essence of the 'times'. Sadly, only a few copies were distributed with a 'flex-disk' included. Some copies did not include the flex-disk at all. The promo package included mostly 'black-white' pictures to capture the theme.Other then this footnote: I think it`s a quite good sellection of songs by unknowns (to some) to capture this era"
2,Jack kornfield lapses into new age coma,"Even though I admire jack's skill as a vipassana teacher, He seems to becoming progressivly warm and fuzzy. His writing style is grating and over sweet and he doesn't seem to have an ounce of critical thought to contribute. This book just seem to continue his slide from vipassana teacher into wayne dyer style new age teacher. I can't recommed this book, But I did like the tape set ""The inner art of meditation."""
4,After the guru trip,"Excellent comments on coming down from the guru trip. Particularly helpful for anyone disillusioned with a guru. Well written, good stories and insights. An easy read."
3,NOT compatible with all JVC receivers!,"After reading about problems certain consumers were having with this JVC adapter (loses preprammed channels, reverts to channel 1 when powered off), I called Audiovox to get list of compatible JVC receivers and realized my JVC car stereo was not on this list. Now I need to exchange my stereo if I want XM radio. Here's list of compatible JVC receivers: KD-DV6200, KD-DV4200, KD-AVX2, KD-AV7010, KD-AVX1, KD-ADV6270, KD-AR870, KD-AR770, KD-AR470, KD-AR370, KD-SHX85, KD-SHX750, KD-LHX550, KD-AR8500, KDK-AR7500, KD-AR5500, KD-AR270, KW-AVX706, KW-XC400, KW-XC410."
1,NO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is not the way to go if you want to create a website that will draw attention! If you want to learn how to write HTML I recommend that you buy HTML 4 for the world wide web, by Elizabeth Castro. That book will help you create good websites. After buying and using this book I was not happy with the results I had, so I bought Elizabeth Castro's book on HTML 4, and now I love the results and will never again buy a Dummies book. If you buy this book you must be a Dummy!!!"
3,Learned a Little,"I honestly did not know a thing about building websites before I started. Miss Komando's first 8 or so lessons should have concluded the book, but unfortunately it did not. She should have spent more time writing about different tags then trying to unsuccessfully make the reader laugh."
1,"Good grief, Padre!","I really tried to read this book. I've read most everything the Good Father has written, both fiction and non-fiction, but I just couldn't finish this. Cinda-Sue's dialect is distracting, incorrect, and extremely offensive. I have lived in the south most of my 62 years and I have never heard anyone begin a sentence with ""happen"", nor have I ever heard the word ""bodacious"" used. The ""Hollywood"" / ""Beverly Hillbillies"" / ""Hee-Haw"" representation of the south and Southerners are stereotypes that need to die.Once you get past (if you can) Cinda-Sue the plot is convoluted, cumbersome, and boring. Don't waste your time with this book."
1,Not Worth the Cost,"Most of the exercises in the book can really be done without needing any foam rollers. The roller part just seemed like kind of a gimmick. I have a foam roller and it is great for my back and rounded shoulders. However, this book didn't provide any insights into exercises I either couldn't simply think of on my own or easily do just as well without using any rollers."
2,"I guess when you buy things ""new""--> they can still be old.?","The bleach may have worked, but the toothpaste wasn't in good condition. It tasted old, and to even get it out was a struggle. The ingredients weren't mixed so you basically have to massage the tube to get anything besides a watery liquid to come out. I wasn't very happy with thw overall pacckage. I guess when you buy things ""new"", they can still be old."
4,Best baby bottles for infants,I found these bottles very useful for my daughter as a transition from breast feed to bottle feed. The shape of its nipple to similar to a breast nipple. I believe it makes baby easy to learn sucking milk from bottle. I would highly recommed Gerber NUK Orthodontic bottles to those mothers who want to breat feed and bottle feed to their baby at the same time.
2,Great idea. Poor execution,"The bottle is great and PBA free. The vent idea is great, but does not work in preventing a vacuum, like the old Gerber wide silicone nipples that vented throuh the base. The baby sucks until a vacuum is created, and has to release for air to get back in. Expected more from such a reputable manufacturer. Do they test these things?"
2,Not as good as others....,"I have read several of the Morgan's Mercenaries books and found this one to be lacking in many areas. The story is depressing and the lack of in depth character development makes it difficult to be sympathetic to their plight. You start not caring after awhile and the characters are just annoying. There is none of the ""action and adventure"" that is in the other books in the series. This whole story can be boiled down into a couple paragraphs as restated as background information in several of the other books. Read the rest of the series instead."
4,I really enjoy the modern interpretation.,"The character leverages the addictive behavior of the novel character. It's different than the BBC Sherlock, and I like both."
4,Rather pleased,"The show has promise; the acting is quite good, as is the directing and locations. The premise is interesting and given Sherlock Holmes morphine problems, believable for an updated version of the character. The shows' writing needs a little work as does the chemistry between Mr. Miller and Ms. Liu but that should come with time. All in all an enjoyable way to spend an hour with your television set"
3,Entertaining enough,"Decently enjoyable to watch, pretty good rapport between main characters, and alright evolution, thus far. It is Sherlock Holmes lite."
2,A bit too strange,"I did not enjoy this but my significant other, male, did. Sherlock talks very quickly and I find him hard to understand. The Dr. Watson character seems amaciated and timid. She is not a character I warm to. This Sherlock is even more quirky than others."
4,Great Show,"I was looking for a show that was similiar to Bones on Fox, and I found a show that is great on its on its own. Love Holmes and Watson!"
3,Elementary,"This series does not adhere to the Conan Doyale storylines as others have, but rather loosely utilizes character biographies and plot elements to create the series. It is an interesting show, occasionally smart and with a good rapport between the main characters. The focus through the fist half of the first season has been in building the characters and developing relationships, sometimes a bit slowly. Hopefully the introduction of nemisis Moriarty will liven things up."
3,Could be named anything,"I wasn't blown away by this. It was interesting enough, but I was not impressed at all by Lucy Liu, and I thought I would be. There wasn't enough resemblance to Sherlock Holmes for me. It was fine as a detective show, but not satisfying as a Holmes spin-off."
4,Great Holmes,"Elementary has transfered the the Sherlock Holmes character, with all his quirks, to modern day New York, and done it well. The personification of Watson as a female sober companion actually works and the interplay between the Holmes and Watson characters is entertaining. I also like the way the police are portrayed as competent collaborators with Holmes and not bumbling fools. Very entertaining show."
5,The Raid,Top 3 military history books I've ever read. Excellent review of covert operations in Vietnam and the courage of the American soldier. I have searched for this book in stores for years to own a copy so I can loan it to friends.
3,Good info - small booklet,"This small, spiral bound booklet has some good information in it, but I missed the part about it only being 78 pages when I ordered it. At $21.95, it's fairly expensive for what you get."
5,One of the best,"I have been working with adolescents in conflict with the law for approximately 12 years as well as with their families. This is one of the most comprehensive guides I have ever seen. Power and compassion is the other one near the top by Jerome Price. Every one of the interventions in this book have been used by me with the families I work with. For those criticising the severity of the interventions I would think that the clients you are working with would be higher functioning than the pre-contemplative childhood onset conduct disorder kids mandated by the courts for treatment. Only 10% of my referrals have a parent willing to attend. If the police are supportive in your community, then use them but we all know this is not the norm. The book explains clearly how to restrain without being abusive. BTW almost all of these kids get worse before they get better (extinction burst) so plan for it ahead of time."
2,Two Tier Bathroom Space Saver Cabinet,"It's a different thing to see the picture when you shop and order, to have it.... not good material, plastic not resistant to body lotion or some other stuff. Poor value"
5,good product,brought this as a gift for my mother building it was easy its pretty sturdy no real complaints i received my order quickly it was exactly what how the advertised it
2,Not so much,"I have to agree that it can be condensed a lot.... He comes off as all knowing and we should listen to his every word. Real estate is where to put the money, well my IMHO I think the housing market is about to crash, so does Greenspan, why do you think he's getting out while he can. I bought the book used, for the one or two nuggets it's ok. Ok, prepare for the crash that everyone knows is coming anyway, and with Katrina, Rita and Iraq you don't need to be a prophet. CASH, GOLD, I recommend, not property, free, enjoy.20080911, Just reviewed my post and just saying that I was right! Housing is tanking. So I put money into metals, as for the others, ""How's that working for you?"""
5,Great Book,It's like he could predict the future or something. I'm wondering if he was talking about the 2008 crash. Great buy!
2,"The Government will screw you, AGAIN!","Use your head, and you will outsmart Rich Dad! Having forsight. The book (I listened to the book on CD) was interesting and eye opening but seemed to mull over the same points (not uncommon with anything in the Rich Dad series). Basically if the Gov't doesn't change its distrubution rules with 401ks and IRAs, when the baby boomers are ""forced to take $$"" from these accounts (that are all the stock market), Our stock market will crumble. This obviously being a forsight of supply and demand, More sellers than buyers, the market will drop. I don't know that I buy this ""scare"". As the other poster said, if you have read his other books, no need to spend the cash. I just summed it for you anyhow."
1,Repetition - the same concept again and again and again,"If you learn best by repetition, this is the book for you! He states the same concept, or lunch appointment with ""rich dad"" over and over again. Sometimes I went back in the book to see if I lost my place, but no, he just keeps on saying the same thing over and over again (didn't I just say that?). I'm disappointed."
1,ALL filler.,"Another bunch of blather, in my opinion.The biggest stock market crash in history may becoming. IS probably coming, even. But WHEN, Mr.Kiyosaki, WHEN? In 2016? It might, but you don't know,the chairman of the fed doesn't know, the Presidentdoesn't know, no one does. You're guessing. All your bookssay you're a money expert, based on a questionableautobiography, anecdotes, and a gullible public. I don'tthink Mr. Kiyosaki gives very good advice. I'd preferAndrew Tobias, Ben Stein, or God help me, Suze Orman.Sorry."
3,Rich dad Prophecy,"I have read many books in the Rich Dad series, and unfortunately, Mr. Kiyosaki continues to recycle the same concepts and themes over and over again. This book could have been written in 20 pages to get its unique, from his other books, message across. I would definitely not pay full price for this book and even if free, you may still feel frustrated at the redudancy of the message by the end of the book."
2,Repeat,I thought this book took forever to get to the point and if you've read his other books a lot was repeated in this one.There were only a few good points.
1,Feet looking for a good shoe,These shoes have very little support and have been a loss of 35 dollars. I have replaced the inserts to attempt to salvage these shoes with no success. They also run a little small.
5,Truly one of Morricone's finest arrangements,"After watching the movie several times, one realizes that the soundtrack was edited so well with the period piece that you can easily follow the movie by merely listening to the outstanding movie score."
2,Explicit sex and violence,"This movie was totally different from what we expected.Much explicit violence and sex. Parents be ware.I did enjoy the historic nature of the movie.The cars and advertising, politics of the time."
1,Clumsy,Compared 2 WATERPIK and the PANASONIC portable irrigator it runs a somewhat clumsy and messy second. Sorry!
3,Runny Rembrandt,"We have been using Rembrandt for years and love it EXCEPT lately the toothpaste seems to run out of the tube rather than squeeze out in a nice bead. If it is a cost saving change, they will probably wind up losing some very loyal customers."
5,First Brush? Stains Lifted!,"I am a college student and a barista. Needless to say, both professions required large consumption of coffee! I bought the toothpaste on a whim because I couldn't drop the cash for any professional whitening and didn't want to fuss with at home kits. Under the impression that the toothpaste wouldn't make my teeth any MORE stained, I was not expecting much. Other brands had suggested ""whitening"" and I never noticed a thing. I gave my teeth some thorough brushing and I when I rinsed, I noticed a big difference! Upon subsequent uses, it's been getting better and better! My breath is fresh and it leaves my gums feeling good too!I am SO happy with this product and I will never EVER go back to any other dental brand!"
4,Great toothpaste,"This is the best toothpaste I have ever used. I've been using it for a long time. Every once in a while I will switch up, trying to find a brand that works as well but is cheaper, but I have had no luck. I drink coffee every day so I have to stay on top of it or my teeth get yellow pretty quickly.One star off because it's pretty expensive for toothpaste.The texture did change a while ago (it got thinner) but it's smoother and seems to work as well for me.I don't think it's an Amazon problem because what I have bought from the drugstore is the same consistency."
1,As bad as Vertigo,"I can't stand this shameful song. Pathetic, lazy, canned, cliche, silly and posh. I really hate this crappy song. Vocally, Bono sounds terrible. This song features such a thin and pinched Bono vocal it beggars belief."
1,"For love or money, money, money, money...","As sentimental as Bono's sunglasses, this canned song is an ode to Bono's greed. A fake touching melody, this song was released on 3 different singles, of course, one of them with a filler DVD, that include ""Vertigo"". They knew this crap is even worse than that annoying tune, so they had to put something catchy on this single.How come some fans can't realise this is the most clear evidence of U2's corporate sellout?. I mean, 3 SINGLES FOR THE SAME PIECE OF CRAP!. Bono's raspy voice is annoying as hell!. This boring crap is much too slow without ever reaching any climax.For love or money? I have the answer, for sure."
1,"How To Use The Name of ""U2""","This is the worst ballad I've ever heard. Silly, commercial, cliche, pathetic, posh, artificial, filler, boring, lame, shameful, pitiful, annoying, sissie, canned, recycled, cheap, etc, etc. This crap is nothing but a collection of cliches for the Grammy Awards. The other fan was right, video is even worse and more pathetic. Shame on U2, I can't hardly believe this is a ""U2"" song. This lame attempt at song is an absolute piece of crap and anyone with any musical sense would throw it out the window for being tainted by this bland, vanilla, and sickening commercial use of the name ""U2"".Plus all we are sick of ""Vertigo"", so we don't need any pointless remix, videos, etc.U2 should quit... after getting their 6-7 Grammies for this crap, Vertigo and their How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, and after being named ""The band of the year"", ""Album of The Year"", ""Song of the year"", ""Video of the year"", etc once again by Rolling Stone..."
4,No captions!!,What a shame this documentary only has sub-titles for the speakers who do not speak English. Most of the others have heavy accents. I wear hearing aids and it was nearly impossible for me to understand a great deal of what was said. How can any modern production not be captioned for the hearing-impaired?
3,Bushnell 16x50,"This is my second pair. The first is abut 20 years old. I do like the new 1/4"" threaded screw socket. I can secure the binoculars to my tripod pretty easy with the hardware I have. The downside to these binos is that the prisms seems to be slightly out of alignment...which was the problem with my old binos although they were far worse. If the prisms were in alignment, I'd say these are a good value for the money."
1,"HEAVY, and UNSTEADY FOCUS","I read other review, and decided to give it a try. As soon as I recieve it in the mail, and opened the box, I realized this was a mistake. CHEAP quality Binocular with ""high power"" being a selling point. It came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart. you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place! It is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation. You will be CONSTANTLY ajdusting the focus. Your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it. Indeed Strap, Case, Lense protectors are all cheap crap, and annoying to have it all ON~! I am taking this back, and buying MADE IN JAPAN ""NIKON EAGLE VIEW"" 100 times BETTER. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR~!!!!!!"
2,Bad for Birding - Make me dizzy,"I purchased these with the intent of using for bird watching but they literally make me feel dizzy and green. No matter what I try, they just don't seem to provide a clear, distinct view. Seem abnormally darker than others I've used and never give a crisp clear view. On the other hand, they are by far more ergonomic than the old ones I owned, feel great, solid, nice set...but wish I'd kept my 30 year old set instead. Not good for bird watching. Can't begin to imagine for sports. Perhaps its my eyes? Unsure but they don't compare to 30 year old set."
4,"Decent Binoculars, not good for birding","I bought these binoculars to watch the birds in my backyard but failed to do sufficient pre-sale research. Their nearest focus point is probably 50ft and their magnification is generally higher than you would want. So they are ill suited for my intended use, but that is my fault, not Bushnells.For viewing things further away they are fine. They seem rugged and very solid, though I haven't done much with them. I like the rubberized housing. The one general complaint I have is that the rocker focus mechanism has too much give in it. You can rock it for a few degrees before it actually starts doing any focusing."
1,Extreme caution required,"Great idea, squalid execution. I'm not surprised that Amazon has dropped the price to around half the RRP, but in my opinion it's still over-priced.Why? Mediocre user interface; claimed iPod support but not with my Windows-formatted 4G 20GB unit; frustrating menus. After 48 hours fighting this product I shipped it back."
1,Not Good,"Extremely dissatisfied. Expected more than this product delivered. Experianced problems with freeze-up. Could not watch a complete movie, even with a wired connection."
4,great for video streaming,"Bought it for primarily streaming avi xvid movies off PC. Finally got it working well after setting up with tversity's free media server software. it required alot of tweaking with ffdshow direct show filters. Look to tversity and netgear's forums for help. Tversity is also great for rss video feeds/video podcasts in flv, mp4 formats."
1,way way too much,This book was too hard to follow. The author assumes that the reader (me) understands or has a dictionary is hand at all times. Which of course I did not.
5,An Ideal Replacement,"Many of the smaller boxed drill bit sets do not come with the more odd sizes, such as a 9/64-inch drill bit, so this is an ideal replacement for when that particular size breaks in your master set. The gold ferrous oxide is strong and cuts great. It matches the other sizes I have in my set. I ordered one, dropped this inexpensive bit into the storage hole in my master box set as a replacement, and it is as if I had never broken the old one to begin with! Great!"
2,Big disappointment,I'm sorry I purchased this. It is not what I had envisioned.....I wanted more authentic African music. African voices are magnificent...why not let them sing their own music?
3,I never buying anything unless i can look at it first,"I bought this product because others gave it misleading reviews. I was hoping that the verbs would be written in the kanji and kana forms using furigana to translate the kanji. Its does have the verbs in all there forms and tells you which are not really used. It also tells you how to turn dictionary forms of the verbs to either the te or masu form. In that aspect the book is awesome. As for examples, it doesnt make it clear for which form it gives an example, which is a down fall. I was hoping that after every form i would get an example sentence but instead it gives us 5 random examples and if your not advanced your unsure which sentence belongs to which form. The book has potential just needs to fix those two downfalls and its awesome. Also letting the reader know if it is written in kanji or kana more often would be great also. Maybe next edition..."
2,A whole lot of nothing,"This book was chosen for a book club and honestly, I was hard pressed to get through it. I expected more out of the author, but even half way through it hadn't turned the corner. One drug deal after another and eachchapter seemed the same to me. Very disappointing."
2,Just the facts...no cohesive hook,"Mark Bowden's heritage as a journalist shows in this book. He goes into precise detail about Larry Lavin's (the dealer) life. The characters drift in and out of Larry's life just as people do in yours. After a while, I lost interest in keeping track who was who. I read about a third of the book before I stopped.When I think back, his book ""Killing Pablo"" was in the same style. The difference is that while I was interested in the history and methods used to bring down the cartel; I wasn't interested in the day-to-day life of a drug retailer.If you are interested in the facts about Larry Lavin's life or if you care about how to grow and keep a drug trade, this might be the book for you."
4,A word or two about Doctor Dealer.,"Doctor Dealer is an excellent read and far superior to any otherbook written on the subject (Larry Lavin), in part because of theway Mark Bowden tells the story. Despite a lack of pictures (there are none), Bowden's storytelling literally makes you feel like you are there with the characters. Any Philadelphian who reads this story will feel as if he or she lived the tale becauseof the specific geographical details that Bowden allows. Doctor Dealer is truly a Philadelphia story (albeit a transplanted Philadelphian) which leaves the reader shaking his or her head at the magnitude and incredible level of cocaine dealing which put this city at the center of many individuals worlds."
1,Another cop out,"Every organization that understands child developement has come out against spanking. Why? Because all of the research has shown that hitting children is potential dangerous to their physical, emotional, and social health (and I would add spiritual health). There are many good books on how to raise children in non-violent ways. Anything by Jane Nelson or Dr. Sears is a good resource. I ask parents to please consider the future well-being of their children before being duped by somebody who is obviously only interested in making money, and not the well-being of our children."
5,Extend your way to more fun!,"These are great add-on's to the Frigits if you already have a larger set. We use them on the file cabinet in my office, and now the kids can wrap contraptions around the corner of the cabinet.I am always amazed how kids gravitate towards marble contraptions (even older ones (13-15) that come by can't resist making something on my cabinet and running some marbles through their paces)."
3,Made a mistake ordering it,I should have read the product label more carefully but now I cannot return it. Much cheaper than drug store but for sensitive skin so does not have too many of the scrubbing material inside.
2,Very Poor Theodore Case Book,"Simplistic and childish and lacking so much information about Case and the development of sound-on-film movies, it isn't even funny. This book isn't even worth $2.00.The fight with DeForest is totally missing in any detail, since DeForest tried to cheat Case and embezzled his funds. DeForest was a self serving liar, stock swindler, cheat and desperate for any publicity all his life. Claimed inventions, like Case's, as his own for stock sales purposes.Other books on the era, ""Speed of Sound"" and others, had the detailed information, why not in this book too? DeForest did not invent sound-on-film as his biographers claim, Case was far ahead of him with a superior system that gave much better sound reproduction.Photo content is the absolute minimum, should have had a lot more.A cheap sleazy book and does Case no credit at all. He deserves a lot better than this one.Very disappointing and returned to Amazon as just not good enough for the price."
4,A music collector in Pa.,"This is a pretty good cd. I bought it mostly for ""Turn up the radio"". The sound quality could be a little better. All in all a good cd for the money."
1,Poor design - avoid,"I had a moderately performing shower radio and decided to replace it with something better. This one was fairly low cost, so I thought it might be a good risk. It wasn't.* The sound quality is terrible -- very tinny sounding. I get better audio through the telephone.* The antenna is extremely sensitive to movement around it. Since it's designed as a shower radio, you are generally right next to it and moving, causing the signal to go from loud to scratchy to soft to loud again.* The dials cannot be easily tuned with wet fingers.In short -- this is a poor radio, and it's a TERRIBLE shower radio. I regret buying this and I'm going back to using my old one. Avoid this one."
1,Don't waste your $$ on this one.,"I purchased one of these (not via Amazon) and had to return it.It had absolutely no reception (just static). I tried both rechargeable batteries and regular batteries. The static was louder with the regular batteries, but still no reception. The price may seem like a great deal, but if the item doesn't function as designed, then it's just a waste of money.**Oh... in the interest of full disclosure - the one that I purchased was white and green, not blue."
1,golf mind link,I was sadly disappointed with this video. The price... did not match the quality. Save your money and buy a lesson!
3,Ok for the price,"I would rank the headphones performance as fair when compared to others.I have had my pair for 2 years now with out any problem.No volume control and the headphones not working withoutthe battery were my 2 biggest complaints.Since dropping them from 4 feet onto a hard surface, my newest complaintis cheap plastic, although its hard to fault the headphonesfor my own clumsiness. Be gentle with them is my caution."
1,Piece of....,"it came with no batery. I changed it, then the watch broke down... no comments... ... ..."
5,Lois and Clark season 4 Review,The DVD was in great condition when I got it in the mail. I really enjoyed watching it since it is no longer on TV and it has been years since I watched it. It really is a great season and series as well. I give it 2 thumbs up!
5,For sheer entertainment value . . .,". . . and a great mind candy beach read for those lazy days on vacation, strap yourself in and prepare for impact! With scenes not in the movie(or will they be in the special edition DVD out soon?) the novelisation of the excellent alien invasion disaster epic is surprisingly well done for this type of spin-off. Stephen Molstad transposes the film characters into print very well in a cinematic style yet painting a more human picture of a cardboard character in places! This novel is also a good introduction for young adults to the world of'adult'fiction, in my view. Great if you want a good, easy-reading book with a bit of dramatic impact, also check out SILENT ZONE, an interesting prequel."
3,Fast Read,"This was a real fast read for me. I liked the book, but it wasn't one of my favorites. The relationship between Shining Dawn and the man she considers to be her brother is very touching. And Blade is an alright guy. I wish the one character was brought out more. Shining Dawn knows how to stand on her own two feet that's for sure."
2,Mediocre and worse than many other Praxis I books,"This mediocre book is worse than most other Praxis I books I used. I found that Cliffs PPST and Barrons How to Prepare for the PPST and Computerized PPST were much, much better, Both these books cost the same as this book and they are much more helpful with better review and practice tests. Take a look at these books before you buy this one."
1,Garbage,"Is this book for real? I didn't find one bit of useful information that I didn't already know. This book is disorganized, unresearched, and a complete waste of time. I'm really getting tired of hearing ""you can save money by not buying those expensive Starbucks drinks."" Give me a break. I don't buy Starbucks, I already know it's a waste of money.This book has several unnecessary financial ""quizzes"" which tell you nothing, and meaningless pyramid charts. Even the ""humorous"" references are ridiculous... in one part it says you should celebrate your debt reduction program by ""experimenting with bisexuality."""
3,Tell me if this worked,can somebody who has this video please rate it. I would like to know if it works
4,Excellent Versions of Classic Themes,"This CD features new orchestral arrangements of Morricone's most famous themes. It's a very interesting album and even if one prefers to quirky original recordings of his western scores (like I do) it's still well worth a listen. (The only reason I'm giving this Four Stars is because some of the personality of the themes hasn't quite translated to some of the versions on this collection.)The versions of ""Two Mules for Sister Sara"" and ""For a Few Dollars More"" are particularly well presented. However, if you're looking for some of Morricone's original recordings, I recommend you pick up ""A Fistful of Morricone."""
4,"Oh My Goddess, they've shrunk!!!","It's not animation that will change the world or make you think. And that's the point. Adventures of the Mini-Goddess is a foray into cute, harmless fun, and there's nothing wrong with that.Fifteen episodes of your favorite Goddesses, Belldandy, Urd, and Skuld, as they explore the house in a diminuitive size, and have adventures with their friend (and constant foil for their mischevious pranks) Gan-Chan.Missions to the moon, weddings among household appliances, and battles with giant moldy monsters (remember kids, just toss the moldy cake and don't eat it), as well as adventures in weight loss, and a game of baseball, it's good clean fun."
5,"Classic Entourage, Puzzled by Negative Reviews","With this set we now own the entire series on DVD, and it was a great ride.This last season was classic Entourage, and I enjoyed each episode just as much as the early seasons. The characters we love were all given some closure.My only complaint is that there were only 8 half hour episodes on two discs, so this last ""season"" was very short."
5,AWESOME,I COULD NOT WAIT UNTIL I RECEIVED THE LAST AND FINAL SEASON OF ENTOURAGE AND WHEN I DID I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED AT ALL. THANK YOU AMAZON ONCE AGAIN.
4,Good ending,"Overall a good ending to eh series. Nice setup for the movie that will be made this year. Overall, good purchase."
1,uncomfortable!,"I bought this product hoping I wouldn't have to take aspirin for my headaches or at least less . After using this uncomfortable product for a short while, I noticed It gave me a headache.It works nothing like accupressure.Such a disappointment!"
2,Deceived,"I purchased this product from the hype of an HGTV special, because I suffer from stress headaches often. It is very uncomfortable on the head and is not very relaxing when it vibrates(massages). As for the product, I received it in a respectable time frame and it was exactly what I ordered. I am not satisfied with its performance or comfort."
1,Isn't the joke over yet?,"Popa Chubby may have fooled the graybeards who run the awful NYC blues club scene, but anyone who doesn't have a tin ear realizes that Chubby has yet to pen a single decent song, plays woefully too loud, and has gone through more recording contracts than Carter's has liver pills. This album is no exception, without a single redeeming quality. Please, blues labels, start signing artists with actual talent and not cartoon characters. If it isn't Curly here, it's 13-year-old girls. Enough already."
1,cable is scratchy,i got this cord and it is scratchy the first time i used it. it looks good but the wiring is shot and it is brand new. i guess you get what you pay for
1,defective,Only one audio channel worked when I used it. Too inexpensive to bother returning it - I'll choose a nicer one next time.
1,The cord doesnt fit well in my phone. I have iphone 4 and both ends do not fit well into the phone. I am returning it.,I bought this because it was cheap. Although it had about 20% bad reviews I thought it might work. I purchased this as this was of perfect length to use it with my iphone in car. Sadly it doesnt fit well in my iphone (4).I am now going to return it and purchase one from the store as I dont have much patience to look for one online.
4,Nice plugs.,I bought a few pairs of these cause I needed to cut and rewire different wires to go to different places on the plug. I have a wireless video receiver that does not play well with a LCD monitor so I cut one of these and changed up its video and audio signal. The wire is a little stiff but it isn't that bad. The connection points are snug and the video signal is now crystal clear. I would recommend these to anyone in need of a short lead of this type.
4,Good cable,Received item as described in a timely fashion. It works properly and has given me no trouble. I would buy it again.
3,Cheap Flimsy Cable,"The cable works and is a great price but it's very flimsy. I used it for my ipod in my car and after about the sixth time of stowing it away after use it stopped working properly. Lesson is you pay for what you get.Giving this three stars because it works it's cheap and it's mainly my fault it broke, I would wrap it around my Ipod after use which just destroyed the connection between the cable and the cable head."
1,Sucky,Bought this cord to plug my MP3 player into the aux input on my car stereo and it doesn't work you have to wiggle it around and it doesn't stay working
1,Absolutely horrible,I did not expect top end for the price just something useable. This cabe provides almost no sound and anything that can be heard is extremely tin sounding. It is unusable an complete crap dont waste your money.
1,Is it broken?,"I see a lot of glowing reviews here, so when I got this I was surprised to notice that these wires do not seem to work well. The wire is really flimsy, and when connecting my player to my car speakers the sound output volume level is so low that it makes this product useless. I don't know if my product is broken, but I do not recommend these wires."
1,very unhappy,I still haven't gotten my items wich i orderd a while ago. I have actually gotten other things that i orderd much much later
3,Worth its price - but not great quality,"Cheap, but not great quality. You have to play with the cable when in a headphone jack in order to hear the audio properly"
2,As cheaply made as possible.,"Cable produces a lot of background hiss and popping/cracking if it rotates slightly when plugged in. It is comprised of cheap plastic on cheap tips with (what I can assume is) the thinnest gauge wire they could use.I do not recommend this 2-ft cable. It was a big let down considering the good number of reasonable reviews.Thankfully, the cable only cost me $1.32.Also of note. Shipping was atrociously slow from Hong Kong. I ordered in September and didn't receive the cable until the first week of November."
5,beautiful album,"This CD is well-produced, features great musicianship, and classic song-writing. It's obvious that Gary Hill has roots in old-time country with his sincere, honest lyrics that anyone with a soul can relate to. Songs like ""Explain this to Me"" and ""I Still Love You"" are sweet and melodic, while ""Damn Good Thing,"" and ""Ain't Coming Back"" proves Gary's boots are also made for rockin'."
4,A Good Beginning,"If you want a good laser pointer, and a good Swiss Army knife, this is your pick. It's a strong, compact laser pointer, and it has a penknife, a scissor, and a nailcleaner."
1,Does NOT fit the Treo 650,"This product does not fit the Treo 650. It arrived in a bag clearly labeled Palm Tung T5, with no reference to the Treo. The seller may enjoy advertising that it works for the Treo as a way to sell more product, but it's not even close. It doesn't even fit into the phone! May work for Tung, but steer clear for Treo 650."
5,Thermaltake SILENT775D CPU Cooler,"Lowered my Intel Core2 Duo E6600 processor temp by over 15 degrees! Very quiet fan, moves alot of air. Fit perfectly on my motherboard Evga 680i, Powering directly off the board. The air cooled my memory too! Highly Recommended! and very fast shipping from Tiger Direct.Thanks"
5,Love this poster,I brought this for my teen daughter who loves Mariah Carey. She was especially impressed to find out it was a drawing.
3,Lancome Absolue Bx .25 oz,"This is a good product but even for a travel size, I felt the amount of cream in the jar was very much on the low side."
3,"A nice starter kit, but can't stand on it's own","Length:: 0:54 MinsIt's a good starter, but you'll be craving more pieces."
2,strap clip broke after 6 months,"The bag seemed sturdy at first, but not designed for heavy duty usage. The shoulder strap clip broke after only 6 months of normal use."
5,great book,"I read the book twice and I will read it again. Mate shows ina clear way, how cracy and inhuman our western - andespecially US-American - civilization has become. And heshows ways to escape that crazy environment - the rat-race.The book is worth to be read"
3,a text for peasantry,"This appears to be a handbook on how to go from European peasant to European peasant in one generation. Enjoyable if at times infuriating. I'm reminded of the old essay in which the author visited Walden Pond but sadly concluded that he must forego a Thoreauean life for the sake of a twelve year old who needed a new baseball mit. There's a wonderful irony when a man like Mate, who made his money (apparently enough to buy a farm in Tuscany) by writing and publishing coffee table books on yachting, screams at us for not giving up all. I hope that rather than taking himself seriously, he's chuckling all the way to his Swiss bank account. Enjoy!"
1,I had to hold my nose when I read this book,"This guy thinks that every thing was pristine and pure before man. Us Humans... we ruined nature. Then he retreats to the position that the world was pure before World War II. This book makes good reading for Al Gore wanna-bees. It contains nothing of practical value. I couldn't make it through the first chapter. I wanted to read about how someone built their retreat in the woods... but only received large spoonfuls of propaganda against humankind. On the bright side, the cover is pretty."
2,Honest songs.,"When I bought ""Proud Words On A Dusty Shelf"" I was very much into Uriah Heep and Mr. Hensley was my man. I simply loved his songwriting in Uriah Heep. so when he made a solo album I was deligheted and surprised at the same time because the songwriting on ""Proud Words On A Dusty Shelf"" was so different form the stuff he was doing with Uriah Heep. I simply fell in love with this album because of it's honesty and simplicity. This album is my all time favorite. I'm actually lost for words here. ""THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. KEN HENSLEY"""
3,"Massage=Good, Acupuncture=OK, Diagnosis=Needs Help","The hammer feature (massage) and most of the other massage-like features work well for temporary relief. However, in terms of acupuncture (the reason I bought it), the diagnosis feature leaves a lot to be desired (the manual's not good re: how to interpret etc) and the acupuncture sensation isn't nearly the full experience of an acupuncture session."
2,HealthCare Acu-Point Pen,"Item arrive okay. Unfortunately, it seems to work well for diagnostics, but doesn't seem to work when it comes to applications for doing some self- electronic accupuncture relief. Don't know if the unit is just defective or is a faux product."
3,"Good writing, but not relateable","As the child of holocaust survivors I thought I would find myself in these pages, but didn't. Then, I remind myself this is fiction, so, the author does have room to invent. The writing is good, but the story didn't capture me."
4,A Moving Portrait,"I found this book tucked away between bigger ones and was intrigued by it. I devoured it in just two days of almost non-stop reading! While having a few, and I mean a very few, slow points, it was one of the most moving portraits of a holocaust survivor family I have ever read. I wonder how much of this is really fiction? I found myself crying uncontrollably at the end as I realized how close the main character's feelings come to all people coming to terms with their parents, and how accentuated it was/is for a survivor child. Although written from a woman's viewpoint, it is not a story just for women. I cried as a man reading this story who has children, and who has a wife that it helped me understand better. I hope it helps her too. Thank you to Cheryl Sucher for such a well-thought-out story.I look forward to more from you. Read it. It will definitely pull at your heartstrings."
5,Time saved--much more than the cost of this e-doc,"I've suggested this article to a number of friends who needed to do something in a hurry on leadership. You can use it to personalize a discussion you have to conduct--and with it, do it in a very short time. An hour of my time saved is worth a lot more to me than the cost of this doc. It's what I love about e-docs, given how little time I have for anything. And now to sign off--writing this is time consuming, but looking ahead, worth it because I want to keep these e-docs coming."
3,Some Good Songs,"Kenny Chesney and the entire beach cowboy attitude is a bit funny and has so many aspects of Jimmy Buffet, but I feel right at home listening to both Chesney and Buffet.Love the beach, ocean, girls in bikinis, a Corona with lime, sitting under the shade in a hammock, getting some sun on a boat deck, sport fishing, or strumming a guitar while looking at the waves.Many of Kenny's songs reflect a similar love and he has a great country twang and sound with a sense of humor.Several songs in this compilation I like. I know I'm missing many great unreleased songs, but for someone like me a greatest hits album is the best bang for the buck."
3,Pretty good,"Kenny's got a great voice he seems to like really slow melodies when he has the potential to make some great country music, it's still a good CD though"
4,Great Songs,Love Kenny C. My hubby and I listened to this from my Kindle Fire while working on the deck ;-) Very nice songs!!
5,Love it,"I love the old Kenny Chesney, but no so much the new stuff. I think he's gone downhill since No Shoes, No Shirt. For an old fan or a new fan, this is a must have CD. It has all of the songs that really highlight his voice and the types of songs that he sings well. It is also just catchy enough that fans of his new stuff will like it, too."
2,Kenny Chesney Greatest Hits,"If this is his his greatest hits, I'm sure glad I don't have his normal albums! Kenny's voice is different from alot of singers and it is a good voice. But most of the songs he sings are just not very good. Out of the 17 songs on this cd, 15 are about love! And most of them are the slow, I love you songs type. The two non love songs, ""Baptism"", a duet with Randy Travis, and ""Back Where I Come From"", are both great."
3,thin and pretty,"This is a gorgeous volume, but there's not much here in terms of real content. Although labeled a ""master class"" the book is best suited to the beginner. For example, in the chapter on PDF presentations, it spends an inordinate amount of time walking through the basics of page transitions, and then inexplicably completely skips the details of how to simulate animations with transitions (a primary focus of the chapter). This is especially frustrating because the authors are obviously all highly skilled, as evidenced by the samples on the accompanying CD. Unfortunately, they seem less interested in sharing their expertise than in simply knocking out a quick run through the basics of the Acrobat interface."
4,Mitzi Minor on Mark,"I would suggest a look at this book for anyone who preaches. It is full of ideas about the gospel, many new and challenging but not unusable. It also includes many, many non-biblical stories that could be used for illustrating texts from Mark, great to have on hand to start your thinking or your congregation's thinking. Good notes, but (too bad) no index, which lost it a point."
4,Great for the price,"I am not a knife expert, but I love this product. I have small children and I love the hide-away feature. The knives are very sharp, and I don't mind that they are lightweight, although I did expect them to be heavier. The bamboo cutting board is VERY heavy compared with my other cutting boards. This is fine though, it stays put and isn't easily moved by little fingers. My sliding drawer was hard to open at first as well, then I figured out that if I opened it in the other direction it was extremely smooth, so I trained myself to open on the one side. Maybe it is only supposed to open one way? In my opinion, this product is well worth the price."
3,You MUST oil the wood before use!!,"Bamboo wood MUST be oiled before use, and once a month or so afterward. It is the driest wood on earth, and does not generate nor hold its own moisture. Instead it absorbs moisture from the environment, which is one reason bamboo grows in humid climates. The wood will split easily, or absorb water as others here have noted. It is recommended that you oil the wood every day for a week before using. You will notice that the oil sinks in within a few hours. I notice in the photo of the product that the wood is split on the top. If you oil it several times before using, and then once a month afterward, it won't split. Don't soak it in water either, wipe the board to clean it off, or use a spray bottle to wet a little. Otherwise, oil, oil, oil!"
3,only release available,This Collections album is not a bad selection of Platinum Blonde tunes but it would be much better to be able to get a hold of a reissue of the Standing In The Dark album which had a certain charm and was the high point of PB's career. Hits albums always leave me feeling cold.
3,Teachers' edition of Entre Nosotros,"I received my book in a very timely fashion, and it seemed to be brand-new. I did know that it was a teachers' edition when I ordered it, and I am not a teacher, I'm a student. It was a reasonable price, however, so I ordered it. What I did not know was that right on the cover, it is written that it is a complimentary copy and it is ILLEGAL to resell it. I would not have purchased it if I had known that."
2,The Littlest Christmas Tree!,"""The Littlest Christmas Tree"" I can't believe/dissapointed that they left that song out. I just ordered the CD but wouldn't of if I had read the reviews first. Luckily, I have the original, I'll just have to hook up the phonograph, if I can find it."
4,Thank you to Kelly,"I too was disappointed with the omission of ""The Littlest Christmas Tree."" Earlier today I had asked a friend if he would record the song from the original album onto a CD for me (he has the equipment). I wanted to surprise my mom and sisters this Christmas. It is after 3:00 am right now. I have torn my house apart -- unable to find the album. I must have given it to one of them. I went to the Amazon.com site hoping that Mr. Skelton's estate had had a change of heart. And Kelly's e-mail was right up top with the wav file. Thank you Thank you Thank you!!!!!! I had tears in my eyes listening to it! You are so awesome! Merry Christmas always and forever from ""A grateful family!"""
1,"Pick another biographer, this one is TERRIBLE!","First, Brendan Gil is noted for 'good work' but this one is the pits. I am not touching the subject matter nor areas of trash this author deems necessary to descend to. (Suffice it to say, I am not an FLW idealist and actually care little about his work).This was a toughh book to read, editted poorly, chronologically all over the map. Probably more disjointed than my simple review with long wordly (boring) digressions that vaguely related to FLW or some area of his life.I can understand why there are so many of these editions 'for sale'. This edition is just as big a 'train wreck' as that of the person whom it tries to cover."
5,2 years and still a good time,"we bought the basic set after seeing this product at another child's bday party. My daughter was 2 then and loved to play alone and with us. Now at 4 it is still a fun toy to break out and see who can make the tallest, most complicated towers-- the travel case is a must-have. It is great for taking to Grandma's house where there are not enough things to do for the kids"
5,"Powerful, Emotional, Unique","Sweep, cinematic, majestic, complex, innovative, beautiful...These are adjectives I would use to describe Great Songs like Kookabura, From The Flagstones, Pink Orange Red... Some Great music is on the Lullabies To Violaine discs. One word I would NOT use to describe this music is ""primitive"".CD's like Victorialand, Blue Bell Knoll, Heaven and Las Vegas are favorites, but some of the Cocteau's greatest work is on these discs. Songs like the acoustic ""Pink Orange Red"" provides new insight as why their songs work...they are simply beautiful, complex, melodic masterpieces.In many ways the early work is more keenly, deeply emotional. Like nothing else ever was or ever will be again. This music touches a different part of the brain than the Rolling Stones, Al Kooper, U2...Highly recommended if you like Mike Oldfied, Tears For Fears, The Cure, Brian Eno..."
1,Poor design,"The first reviewer mentioned a crack by the handle. I bought mine at a B&M store and had the same thing right out of the box. When I went to exchange it (A couple months from purchasing), they no longer carried it. It might be a design flaw and maybe a different pitcher was the replacement because of a redesign. I never did get another after that one."
1,QC problems?,"My fiancee and I registered for this based on the photo and my prior good experience with Luigi Bormioli glassware. The first pitcher arrived with a crack in the back along the handle. The replacement (wow, Amazon was fast!) is intact but looks nothing like the photo. The spout is tiny and completely flattened, so water pours over the top rather than out the spout. It has a pig-nosed appearance--quite ugly. Yeesh. I really like my Luigi Bormioli water and wine glasses. What happened with their pitcher?"
4,The Cybelene Conspiracy...a good read,"This book takes place in the 3rd or 4th century A.D. in the Western Roman Empire capital of Ravenna, Italy. It revolves around a physician and his wife, who trains under him, as they are drawn into a conspiracy involving the pagan goddess Cybele. I love the historical period and the author has clearly done his homework, particularly regarding the medical field of that era. This is the 2nd book of two...the first is titled ""The Secundus Papyrus"". I recommend them both."
4,Enjoyable read,"When I started ""The Cybelene Conspirary"", I thought it was going to be a historical novel and very dry. Instead, the story was compelling...a regular ""almost modern day"" mystery. Really interesting was the use of many medical terms that could have been the pre-cursors to modern terms. For instance, the surgeon prescribed valerian in cases where we'd see modern doctors prescribe valium."
2,Great gift for my four year old,Got the leather police I.D. & Badge Holder to accessorize the deluxe policeman costume outfit that I got for my four year old for Halloween but it wasn't such a great hit with my son. He just kind of looked at it and played with it for a little while and tossed it aside. I think just the costume with the belt would have been enough.
2,I'm wouldn't buy this again,"The stationery is cute and colorful, but the pages are very cluttered. While the envelopes have spaces to write addresses and put return labels, the pages are too colorful and bold. A ballpoint or ink pen doesn't look good on the paper."
3,"If you want a good book of Spanish names, don't buy this.","While this book has a very interesting variety of very exotic names from all over the world, it has practically no Spanish names in it! I wanted a book with a reference of Spanish names, so I was disappointed."
2,Poor performances and strident recording,"The content is very interesting, if largely rearranged.As for the performances, I will give but one example. The first track of disc 2 is one of the only performances (besides the entire score) of the North 2001 title (it is not The Dawn of Man track as the booklet states, it is the title). At the climax, where 'A Stanley Kubrick Production' were to appear on the screen, the Prague first horn plays a melodic note a semitone higher than the original (changing the tonality teomporarily!). Astonishingly bad."
5,IMAX,"What can you say about a great IMAX film. If you have a fine 3d tv like our lg, this film blows your sox off."
2,Not much for your money,"The movie was way to short for what it cost. When you pay that much you expect to see hour and a half show, but not this one. Save your money"
3,Average 3D.....above average price!,"3D was average and actual video material was boring for anyone over the age of 10. Also after it arrived I turned on my new Samsung 46"" LED 3D to one of my DirectTV channels that show 3D videos and documentaries and to my surprise this exact DVD title was being played. In fact it's been on all week at various times and I recorded it with my DVR to see if there were any differences in the quality of the 3D.. My conclusion is not enough to pay the $20 in price. If you have DirectTV and a DVR receiver save your money and record it!"
4,Great 3D showcase!,"This is the first 3D Blu-Ray I've ever watched on my new set, and it was a good choice. The 3D effect is excellent all the way through. At times, I found myself almost reaching out to some tiny little fish that seemed to be swimming in the air between the TV and my eyes - a nifty illusion!The content is nice, giving us some basic information about coral reefs and their accompanying numerous life-forms, with just a little cautionary environmental material near the end. My only complaint is that it would have been helpful to know the approximate size of the various life forms we were seeing. For example, barracudas and trumpet fish, shown in schools, looked to be about the same size on the screen, yet in real life barracudas are much, much larger than trumpet fish. It's a small complaint.The music soundtrack was just right; very pleasant. It didn't distract from what I was seeing, and emphasized the right moments.All in all, it's a relaxing show and a wonderful showcase for 3D."
3,its an ok type 3d blu ray presentation.,"not satisfied with the 3d quality.should have bought different 3d video than this.some 3d seuences are there ,but for the money it is not at all up to that level."
2,Poor image !,Reproduce and poor quality ! No exciting scene as viewer expected . It is priceless Blue Ray disk and for the amateur viewer .
1,The Tortoise DID Cheat. Don't Buy Unless You Enjoy non-American Narration and Bad 3D!,"Oh gawd, please deliver me from this movie!! It really IS like watching a tortoise run a race.Bad 3D presentation; boring, non-American accented voice narration.This was miserable ""3D"" on our 2011 model Oppo and Panasonic Plasma.Do yourself a favor and get this REAL 3D disc about the sea from Amazon: IMAX: Deep Sea (Single-Disc Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray Combo) (2006)Oh, the pain...THE PAIN OF IT ALL!!Aesop, please rewrite your fable so the Hare will win.Stay Safe, (And make soup out of the Tortoise)...GhillieMan"
5,Wake Islands Heroic Stand,"First, I was only nine years old when the attack on Pear Harbor and subsequent battle for Wake Island took place. I remember our father coming to the bed room and telling my older brother and myself that we were at war with Japan. At that time I hadn't even heard the name Pearl Harbor. Thought it was in San Francisco Bay. When naming the battleships which are named for states it kinda of added to the confusion. My folks, like everyone else in North America at the time were glued to the radio and the battle for Wake Island was very much in the news. Several months later a movie came out on the battle of Wake Island which I saw and left everyone with the impression their were no survivors. As an adult I read many articles on the Battle of Wake.Bill Sloan's book is probably the most detailed and informative which also cleared up a lot of misinformation documented by other writers."
4,Informative,"Mr Sloan gives a good account of a sadly unknown battle to many generations. The defenders of Wake set the tone for the rest of the Pacific campaign. The Imperial Empire found out that maybe they did not have the divine right to expansion and that the Americans were not the spoiled, lazy children of priveledge that they expected. While a great triumph for the men who fought there, Wake is, in my opinion a blemish on the US forces for essentially hanging them out to dry. Despite Kimmel's errors at Pearl Harbor, I do have to give him credit for at least trying to help out these abandoned men before his successor, in his infinite lack of ""determinism"", managed to FUBAR the whole mission and leave these US Soldiers and civilians out to dry. Disgraceful!"
4,"Brian, Heather, Nathan and all the cast were great","If you are thinking of getting this album for Brian Stokes Mitchell's voice, i don't think it's worth your money. He only has a couple of numbers in here. One album that has a lot of good stuff with Brian's voice is ""Kiss Me, Kate."" Heather's number in ""Cry like the Wind"" is one of the most magical experience anyone can have."
4,A Good Buy for Cello Students,"This is a very useful and intelligent book for beginning cellists. There is a wealth of information about cello technique, and an abundance of musical and even physical exercises (along with detailed instructions on how to read music). I am very glad I bought this book -- it's a gem."
1,Stopped working after only one year,"I loved this coffee maker. I have owned only Cuisinart and this was my most favorite so far. Until one morning, after a long night with sick kids, it would not turn on! So sad. I could have just got a bad one but I expect a coffee maker to last more than a year! Yes, I am a little bitter. Also, I did order this machine off of Amazon but it may not be this exact seller."
1,It was great while it lasted,"I'm doing an update to my February review. After a whopping 90 days of making fairly good coffee our machine decided to take a trip to the coffeemaker graveyard this week.That makes three Cuisinarts that have lasted a combined total of nearly a year. Not great for hundred dollar+ machines. So to the reviewer who said that since it was Cuisinart it must be good all I can say is good luck.Oh yeah, after sending the second one back and being told that we'd have no warranty on this one since we'd gone through so many machines I don't suppose there'll be a Cuisinart anything in our home again any time soon."
4,I'm now an Amesist,"This book is a touching and hysterical collection that spans across a broad chunk of Ames' life as an artist and as a confused, exciteable, realistic man who always owns up to his choices and his feelings. A very worthy read."
5,An Encyclopedia of Everything that's Wrong about Bush,"An excellent read. Although he makes a precious few inane points (such as the motive for the Electoral College), he makes many points that are not only valid, but that I have not heard from the mainstream media, from liberal outlets like The Nation and Mother Jones, or even from liberal pundits like Molly Ivins and Al Franken. The only other book from which I learned more raw data about conservatism is Greg Palast's ""The Best Democracy Money Can Buy"". I strongly recommend ""Fraud"" to any progressive who doesn't have a full grasp of the extent of George W. Bush's fraudulent ways."
3,Nice but not needed,"This was an interesting book, but we found the info in the guide book to be enough for our trip. Maybe better for someone planning to live there."
2,Not very satisfied,I still have not received the subscription. I am disappointed that it takes a long time when Amazon contracts with an outside vendor
3,linzer cookie cuuter,"I was looking for a pretzel cookie cutter. This one is really cute, but I didn't know what a ""Linzer"" cookie cutter was. Not sure how to use it. Didn't work with my sugar cookie dough."
4,Lovely shoes but too small,"I bought these for my son, and I bought a 1/2 larger than he was wearing but they were too small. I think they fit a little small. However they are lovely and I passed them onto a friend who's son, although older, has smaller feet."
5,hot stuff,so many recipes call for chipotle peppers and adobo sauce. I would be at a loss to find it locally.
2,Not Great,"The author tries to use a silly sense of humor to inform readers about electricity and solar power, but I found his sense of humor overbearing and much in the way of getting across important info. The book could easily have been more informative in half the number of pages."
1,"The Easy Guide to Solar Electric,second edition","If you want a book that talks in generalities and gives NO practical information, then this the book for you. I tried to send it back, but they wouldn't take it. Don't waste your money. Is that clear enough?"
4,Perfect Interim TV,"Sylvania LD-155SL8 15"" LCD HDTV with Built-In DVD PlayerGreat for a small space. Nice picture,good sound, easy to use controls.I did my research beforehand and this is THE best value for the money."
2,Some Lovely Moments,"I'll say at the beginning that movie soundtracks don't always make for good listening. The jolts and explosive sounds are appropriate when watching the movie. If you like to hear them by themselves, you may like this just fine. I find them quite jarring. One track is really pleasing and I could listen to it over and over. That one is called ""Circunderunt me fluctus mortis."" ""Playing Alone"" is also compelling. These are free of the sound effects that I find so obtrusive. I have a music editor on my computer and I edited the jolts out of some of the tracks. I put the whole thing together, leaving out a few of the tracks. The resulting CD is about 35 minutes of lovely music."
1,Horrible film,"Terrible, terrible acting. Ludicrous sets. Totally made-up/re-write of history. I really don't understand the point in making this movie. If they did want to do a martial arts movie, why claim (falsely) that it was based on a real person's life? Dude, he wasn't even in Foshan during the war.BTW, read Wikipedia before flaming me.edit: OK, don't trust Wikipedia or anything else written about him on the 'net. Still a crap movie that revises history and with wooden,stereotypical acting. As someone else commented ""It's a mainland propaganda film, what do you expect""."
5,"Best fighting movie ever, period","Best fighting movie ever, period. Ip Man completely kick @ss, hands down. If you have a chance, check up Ip Man 2 as well. Awesome kungfu movie."
5,Awesome Movie!,This is an awesome movie and definately one you want in your collection. I have both copies now and while the other version is amusing at times with the subtitles these seem a little better. A++++
2,"Entertaining movie, insulted at the end","The movie itself was entertaining, and I enjoyed the fight scenes. The voice-over was a little distracting at first, but I got used to it and enjoyed it more than having to read subtitles.I was insulted at the end when it essentially gave China full credit for defeating the Japanese in WWII. I went on to read several reviews about the historical inaccuracy of the movie, especially the portrayal of the main character. Ordinarily I don't get too worked up over historical inaccuracy (I've come to expect this from movies, and generally I'm just looking to be entertained). Between the ending and the subsequent reviews I was overwhelmed/reminded of the horrible things the Chinese goverment has done with its heavy-handed propaganda. I had watched the movie for free, online through Amazon Prime, and was thinking of buying it for my movie collection until the end. I wouldn't be able to enjoy the movie a second time."
4,Excellent,"I was very interested in this movie, having taken Wing Chun in my youth. For the most part they have pretty accurately portrayed the Martial Art style in technique and style, with the exception of some minor acrobatics. As an autobiography of Yip Man, I think they have made some edits to his actual history. But, since this wasn't a documentary, and made as a action movie, I think it's forgivable. I suppose it should be taken as artist liberties, of the movie industry, which doesn't really bother me. Overall it was a very exciting movie whether you've trained in Wing Chun or not.You can listen to the movie in Cantonese or Mandarin, If you don't speak ether of those languages, an English subtitle is available."
5,Great stuff!,"As a fan of Bob Martin from way back, the only complaint I have is that a major label hasn't snatched him up so more could share this great songwriter and singer. Folk doesn't quite describe this CD. It's too confining a label .Witty and gritty and real, he pulls you into his world with a Dylanesque rasp and lyrical storytelling. A must for the well rounded CD collection."
1,A Waste of Time,This book could easily be cut in half. It rambles in so many areas -- going into mind-numbing detail about unimportant subjects. Don't waste your time
1,Boring...Real Boring,"I thought use of the title of ""secrets"" of success implied that one could take a shortcut to success. The reality is that only true creativity, integrity and hard work (your OWN hard work) will get your there."
1,Not Good at All,"It arrived well packaged. That is the good. It is not ""solid wood"" it is reconstructed wood and Made in Malaysia. One leg fell completely apart right at the stress point. Real poor assembly instructions for the average user. The marks where you are supposed to mount the leaf hinges and stops are way out of tolerance. The leaf does not mate well with the main top. I have taken photos and might post them at a later date. I couldn't really find a number to call for this vendor, so good luck with that. Returns are a pain with this thing. Amazon is a great site, but they can't watch everything. I don't think I would deal with these folks or their products again."
5,Siglo de Caudillos en condensado perfecto,"Excelente libro que describe el siglo de la independencia de México, no es un libro común de Historia logra integrar la trama no como una lista de hechos históricos sino con la sensibilidad del temperamento de cada uno de aquellos principales personajes que participaron en el siglo más revolucionario de la historia de México"
2,Enjoyable but no new revelations,"Unless you've totally missed the boat with natural horsemanship, you know that the key to doing anything with horses is having patience, a theme that is repeated over and over again in every section of this book. I needed help with a bucker, and Jessica's bucking info basically reiterated what I already know. Check saddle fit, and call in a professional trainer. If I had the money for a professional trainer, I wouldn't have bought her book."
2,"Not bad, but not satisfied","The product does work. It made my hair darker quickly. It was a nice, natural color as well. Still, the dye has a very strong and bad smell, leaving my hair to also smell bad during the day. The product also made my hair feel gross and dry. With these downsides, it isn't worth it."
4,"A nice, intense workout","At first the video was too fast paced to learn the moves and workout effectively to it. Then a week and a half later, after working out to it 4 to 5 days a week, I finally picked it up and now it's kicking my butt. I've only mastered 20 minutes at a time so far. My goal is to get through all the workouts without pausing for air :)Kelly keeps you moving the entire time so this is not a DVD for people not totally in the mindset for a workout.Great DVD, I would highly suggest it!"
2,Works fine until it is out of Warranty - then watch out!,"This toaster oven was purchased for its looks to go along with our remolded kitchen 4 years ago. This product comes with a 3-year warranty and ours stopped working in year 4. The heating element on top stopped working so it is toasting unevenly (nothing on top). My other complaint about this oven is the tray. Even using aluminum foil each time when cooking, the tray turned brown in the first few uses after letting off an offensive smell. Bottom line - it works fine but only while in warranty, it seems. A call to their ""customer service"" was of no help since unit was out of warranty."
3,Only Cub Movie Available,"One of the difficulties in recruiting new Cub Scouts is that the boys don't know what that is. Chances are, they have never seen a Cub Scout, and there are none in current popular TV and movies. So, we go back to this one--a 30-year-old story that does not accurately portray what it is to be a Cub Scout leader. The woman is forced to do the job, has no support, and no co-leader. She takes the boys on a field trip with no additional supervision and they get into trouble. In real life, we have guidelines and dozens of local people to help and support Cubs and their leaders.Nevertheless, it is a cute story, and will get boys excited about doing things as Cub Scouts, rather than passively sucking up the idiocracy from the TV set. Gary Coleman at his most loveable. If you collect Scout movies, this is a good one to have."
4,soup recipes look good,"Initially I was very disappointed in the soup recipes, but after trying one with great success, and perusing many others, I now like the book and will try many of the soup recipes which is the primary reason I bought it. It includes several stock/broth recipes.All of the ingredients I've seen are readily available in local stores."
5,mix-up,"Although the books are fine, there was a mix-up with the order and delivery.I wanted the two Moosewood books to be billed to me but shipped to my friend in Raleigh, North Carolina.I realized that you had recorded TWO shipments, one set of books to me, anda duplicate set to my friend. When I reported this, you mistakenly cancelled the NorthCarolina shipment and sent the books to me. Moreover, the North Carolinashipment would have been free of shipping charge, but the books mistakenly sent tome had $4.98 in shipping charges. I took it upon myself to re-ship the booksto my friend in North Carolina and pay the second shipping charge."
5,Dewalt DW1928 7/16 Gold F Oxide Pilot point twist drill bit,"Fast shipping, well packaged, as described. I love the way the point stays where it is supposed to. use center punch, put tip in slight divot, no traveling . Drill runs straight and true. Have used other bits and had them walk off the mark, major upset .. You want to do quality work and precision, drop the coins and buy this product"
2,Unrealistic,"This is (as Vonnegut would say) is a ""Kilgore Trout"" book: one that is better as an idea than as something to read. As an idea, it's great. As a play, the dialogue isn't very realistic. The baseball players talk like they're in a Woody Allen movie. Very arty, references to cultural things, a little neurotic. Pro Ballplayers do not generally talk like Woody Allen. The dialogue just took me out of the story. I couldn't believe that real people would talk like that. As a gay man, I bought it because the idea is catnip to gays, but the writing didn't really get me into the action, but took me out of it. I recommend reading a sample before buying it to make sure that this problem doesn't bother you."
4,lexmark x83-pretty darn good,Nicely put together. Seems quite solidly built and integrates well. Very quiet and the price is definately right. The only real negatives are the fact that its not terribly fast and its a pc fax. It doesn't have the card reader function of the brother product but it is half the price. It's easy to recommend this product.
2,Mine had a life of ~1 year.,"Bought this from Office Max a year and a half ago.After my Windows ME crashed, I re-installed the softwarefor the printer. Now it is not recognized by my PC anymore.So, currently I have a glorified copier on my desk.I called the tech support several times, but since ayear has passed since I purchased this, they are not verysympathetic. I understand. I should have been suspiciouswhen Office Max had put this on sale."
1,Most disappointing printer in the history of the universe,"What can I say. From the day I bought this piece of junk it has failed to work properly. Emailing back and forth with Lexmark's tech support was fruitless on most occasions. Problems popped up, disappeared and popped up again with no rhyme or reason. I might add that my brother-in-law is a tech expert at a major university and could never figure out the slings and arrows of outrageous misfortune I suffered with this printer. DO NOT BUY. I repeat, DO NOT BUY. Learn from my mistake. Right now it serves as a gigantic paperweight. I'm too lazy to call my town's special pick-up garbage service to haul it away."
1,I Won't Buy Another Lexmark Product!!,"I've been running my X83 on WinXP for 18 months with no real problems. Occasional problems were usually solved by re-booting the computer. My usage of this machine is only about 15-20 pages per month (let's see, 15-20 page x 18 months,that's about 270-360 pages over the lifetime of this printer.A week ago, I started to print a document and noticed that the printer wasn't ""On"". Turns out the power supply is OK, but the printer itself totally FAILED (this is what Lexmark' Techs - 3 different ones - decided) with absolutely no warning!! $186 for 360 pages is a little too expensive for me and that doesn't include the cost of the numerous print cartridge that it used.Of course now I'm stuck with three unopened ink cartridges as well.Nothing else from this company for me. Also, I just learned that Lexmark makes Dell's printers, so stay away from those as well."
5,Best on TV,Arguably the best tv series ever made. Happy to say I finally own the series. Came packaged as each individual season placed together and then sealed up in plastic. The individual seasons were fully sealed and brand new. Lots of extras included on each DVD. Good to drop in on Mulder and Scully and relive their adventures.
3,Not the Collector's Edition,The paper booklets that these come in almost guarantee that the disks will be damaged. It has to do with the way that they're slid into the slots. The disks scrape against each other and are scratched. Get a different edition that doesn't come in paper booklets that scratch the disks right in the factory.
5,One of the best TV shows ever!,"Words can't describe how much I love the X-files. I started watching it back in 1994 in Russian, when I was living in Russia. I continued watching it when I came to the US, in English. In fact, I bought two sets of the complete series on DVD: one for my residence in Russia and the other for my residence in the US. Chris Carter is a genius, because only a genius could create such a thoughtful, interesting, enthralling, addictive and clever TV show."
5,x files,WOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE X FILES SERIES WAS A GREAT FIND AND YOU SHIPPED IT FAST I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN I GOT
5,The X Files-Ultimate Collection,"I find this to be the ""Ultimate"" in collections. Though, I haven't viewed all of the dvd's in this collection, I am quite pleased with what I have seen so far. The package did arrive a little damaged, but, the dvd's were ok. The storage case that they come in is quite appealing, however, the drawer can't be opened unless you remove all the dvd's. The cardboard separator isn't strong enough to hold the weight of the dvd's and it rests on the drawer. So, you can't open it and is worthless as a storage drawer. The design of the drawer needs to be worked on some more. Maybe, stronger cardboard.The dvd's rate the 5 stars, the storage unit 2 stars."
4,Braun Handblender,Works fine. Unhappy that it doesn't fit inside Nalgene wide mouth bottles. Have to take an extra step to blend in another container before transferring substance to the Nalgene bottle.
3,"Okay, but nothing special","Blender was okay, as noted above, but it was not as good as an earlier one that we bought. This one seemed to cavitate more frequently and cause splahes of hot soup to erupt. Soup smarted, it did."
3,An interesting book,This a very interesting book and worth a second look. I like the author's style and lots of info here.I also suggest that you read Untapped Wealth Discovered by Jeff Marquis and Kerry Harrison. This book appeals more to me because it goes much deeper into strategies for the over 50 crowd.
4,It's a Bundyful Life,"I am a number one fan of the bundy's! all of the episodes are great shows. I feel that al/bud are the best actors and do not recieve the credit they deserve as talented actors! My favorites are...the one when al loses his car in the car wash...when peggy sees elvis in the mall..etc. p.s.I think steve made a big mistake leaving the show,since it is the greatest tv show in the history of tv!"
2,Won'f fit filter frame.,These refils don't line up with the filter frame. I taped them to my 20x25x5 filter for extra protection. I would not recomment buying these.
2,Game needs tweaking,"Okay, I was really excited to play this game with my kids too. But I was disappointed. The first problem is, when you stick your hand in the unit, it slides all over the place (they should have placed suction cups on the bottom). The lid kept coming off, so we were constantly holding down the lid to keep the unit still. Another problem is that the cards do not stay in place because the unit kept sliding around, so I was rearranging the cards the whole time. When you are playing with a 5 yr old, it is best to use only half of the pieces. The price was not right for this game. I feel like I overpaid about $15.00. You could probably buy a bunch of plastic toys and put them in a jar and make up your own game and have more fun."
4,family fun,Great game for the family. With children ranging from 6 to 13. It is not always easy to find a game we can play together. The only thing I did not like was the timer pops off when you reset for the next player.My 6 year old was able to play with my 5 year old neice.
1,I got porked,"One of Amazons sellers sent me the wrong set of cartridges. I ordered this one and a number 16 black cartridge but was sent a set of 28 and 29s by that merchant. I couldnt get them to respond to emails and needed cartridges so I had to reorder.Dont misread this review, the proper cartridge work just fine, I just got screwed by a merchant that Amazon is supposed to stand by and they didnt and neither did Amazon. So, I finally got this, part of the correct set of cartridges but still have a useless to me set of cartridges that Amazon nor the merchant that sold them will do anything about. Amazon is not flawless and they proved so well to me."
1,DO NOT buy this ink!!!,"I bought this ink because it looked new and I do not trust buying cheap refilled ink online, so I bought from this seller. It has been about 6-7 months The ink is half full according to my printers clculation yet the ink is already dried up. It has actually already been dried up for a few months now I am just now writing up a review about it."
2,works ok but I don't like it,"Got it on sale and it works, so how can anyone complain--but I do. Simply put, I don't like the cone filter which must be used. Their filter holder is designed with a deep pocket and a portion of the heated water will never reach the grounds in a basket filter. Also, I like to start the coffee maker while I'm grinding the beans and water leaks on the hot plate if the pot is not in place. Lastly, Cusisinart could cut the product price by excluding the unnecessary charcoal filter."
3,2009 Kawasaki Vulcan Voyager,This cover is fine. It fits the bike and I only bought as a temporary thing. I only use it in the garage and suited that purpose well.
1,Problems,I couldn't get the volume down to low level for noisey environments. The volume control was so stiff that I had to use a knife to turn it. The tone adjustment did nothing discernable. And the tip of the included tool that turns the tone control knob wore off after a few trys. One battery went dead while the unit was shut off for a week. Very low quality units.
5,All Around Good Introduction To Business Law,Well written book that provides a good introduction into business law principles. Outlines complex concepts with case law that makes it easy to understand. A reccomended read for the pre-law students as well as a valuable reference for business owners.
1,Not Recommended,"I ordered a textbook for school and payed extra for expedited delivery and it took over 2 weeks before I received it. A waste of over $100 and lost time I could have spent doing my work, now I am almost 3 weeks behind. Not recommended for anyone needing a book within a certain time frame!"
1,not what i ordered,"i ordered the text book and received a study guide. i'm not angry because it only cost me a couple of dollars but still, what a waste of time!"
4,not as impressive as some of their other work,"this album starts with a bang with neverending math equation, but much of the album is a let-down for those of you who have already heard modest mouse's other stuff. baby blue sedan is incredible and broke is an undeniably beautiful and pitiful song, but the rest of the album does drag a bit. if you want an album with a couple of great songs, then this will provide that, but be aware that there are a couple songs that you may skip pretty consistently. if you want their best overall album, the lonesome crowded west would be a better purchase. notice, however, that i am not running out to sell my copy of this album, so if you like modest mouse, run out and buy it anyway."
4,good cd. a few bad things about it,"the lyrics will make you think a bit, the rhythms are so catchy and everything is fine. the only problem i have with this cd is, is that in about evrey song, the last minute or two is just repeating the same line over and over. which gets boring... which gets boring... which gets boring... which gets boring....other then that its a fantastic cd!"
5,TPA and DeLonghi and Vapor Sytems are tops!,I'm also doing some research and I find the TPA and DeLonghi brands to be of the highest quality and the people at Vapor Systems to be extremely knowledgeable and responsible. The times I have contacted them they have responded with lightning speed. Heather from CT must be a competitor in disguise to write what she/he did. My advice is to ignore the review of someone so obviously bitter. That goes for Cathy from New Jersey too. Only a competitor jealous of another's success would behave so maliciously.
4,Printer Cartridge for Lexmark Z23,The cartridge prints very crisp and clear. Installation easy.Objection? I haven't found any refills available for it. Just have to buy a new cartridge when it gets empty.
2,list the correct item that your advertising,"Watch out for toner co's that say they have NEW ink jet cartridge's, they advertise it's a new product and then send you a used one,hoping that you'll accept it and not complain. Cheap shot!then when you do write a bad review&they; send you a refund but want you to remove the negative comment so it won't affect their image, watch out you might be the next!!"
5,"A great, fast read","Like one of the previous reviewers, I read this book in a short time (about three days, around my college schedule). It's a entertaining, colorful book with honest takes on the WWE, current and former wrestlers, and the everyday lifestyle of a sports entertainer on the road. Amy tells her story with candor, especially having to do with all the ups and downs of working in the WWE. She's no ""company man"" that acts an apologist for the company she works for. Yet her book is filled with positive stories, she has led an interesting life and is thankful for the experiences she's had. This is the most refreshing aspect of the book, compared to the Dynamite Kid's book, which was very bitter and negative. A highly recommended book, as far as wrestling books go, I rate it only behind Mick Foley's first book, and far ahead of every other one I've read."
3,Lita?,Have o clue who she is. I didnt order this one. Doesnt sound like my knid of music. Thanks anyway
5,Book Worth The Travel,"Young Amy Dumas is known to millions under the WWE Franchise as Lita, the high flying, risk taking, dare devil of a woman who is well known for not only her skills against the women, but against the men as well. I grew up not really liking wrestling, but I would occasionaly watch it with my Uncle who is a big fan. But as I would watch...this young lady would stick out like a sore thumb.Within this book Amy Dumas (Lita) describes her road to becoming the professional wreslter she is today, as well as her journeys after. She has went through a great deal, being nearly homeless after highschool, working as a stripper, taking judo lessons, as well as the carreer threatening neck injury that took place on the set of t.v. show Dark Angel. This novel is well worth every penny to anyone who is slightly interested in the life of this inspiring younge woman."
5,Totally AMAZING,"Ever since I started watching wrestling I have been a huge Lita fan but other than what I had already seen I really didn't know that much about her. After I finished this book I was stunned, it was totally AMAZING and I wanted it to go on forever. This book covered every topic in Lita's life from personal events and problems to her succes in the ring in such wonderfull detail it was like you were there with her. This Autobiography was undoubtedly my favorite!"
5,Good advice from a real expert...,"Kelly James-Enger is one of those rare writers who also knows how to share her success with others who strive for a career in freelance journalism. Her book is filled with solid tips on how to break into the marketplace and then create a solid niche for your work. One of her most important messages is to ""believe in yourself"" - and she is right on target! Bottom line is: If we want people to value our skills, we must first show that we value ourselves. (Review by: Marion E. Gold, author of the ""Personal Publicity Planner: A Guide to Marketing You"" and ""Top Cops: Profiles of Women in Command.)"
2,not what it claims to be,"Very disappointed in this book. Contrary to it's description, it does not help you develop a specialty of your own, but describes a bunch of pre-existing specialties. The book is really just a collection of magazine quality articles covering the only the very basics of each area. There are entire books written about writing in the subjects of the various chapters that are far more useful as books about writing than is this one. This book could only be useful to somebody who needs the obvious pointed out to them."
3,Not as Rapid as you might think...,"The BU-500 charger included in this package uses a fixed 13-hour timer that is reset whenever unplugged. (Stated on Olympus web site) If the batteries are fully charged, the current is reduced, but the light stays on until the 13 hours are up. As my two-year old Olympus BU-100 charger (sadly no longer available, it seems) charged 4 batteries in about 4 hours, I am not sure how this one can be called ""Rapid""."
3,"fun at first, but not for long....","I bought this for my son. He never really played with it. I personally played with it and had a blast trying to find the final item. I think it's a cool conversational toy to have out for guests and what not...something to grab folks' attention, but for a general go-to toy, it's not the thing. Your child may come back to it again and again, but it doesn't strike me as that kind of a toy."
2,Kids didn't play with it,This toy was not to my kids' tastes. Neither played with it (ages 6&7 when recieved) so it went into the garage sale pile. No one purchased it at the garage sale either.
4,Kids Love It a Little Too Much,"We are an orthodontic office. The kids absolutely love this product. We purchased eight of these at different times. We still have three of them, which are the ones we purchased about six months ago. They get dropped and rolled often. We have even seen kids trying to pry the tops off with their parents sitting their watching them try! They last about 6 months in our waiting room."
3,Chai low carb,"Very sweet for a diabetic. I actually bought it for my mom, but she did not like it very much. The service, however, was excellent--prompt shipping."
4,Abbott and Costello In Hollywood/ Lost In A Harem,"Two good non Universal A/C films on one disc. Nice quality prints, good price - what more do you want!!"
4,Good for entry level information,"I use this book to teach a Graphic Production class. This is a good entry level book to wet one's interest in the broad scope of each part of the printing production process. It touchs on everything from scheduling to design to prepress to actually getting it on press al the way through the bindery and shipping processes. Without this basic understanding, new design students have no understanding of what they are creating. This gives a brief snippet about each process. The early designer then at least has an idea of how their final products will possibly be used.Each area of print production can have its own book and ideally designers will learn these processes in depth. As an entry level book however this has all of the basics without overwhelming the student. It also delivers the dry information that creative folks need in simple clear form. After thirty years in this industry I welcome the simplicity this book provides."
2,Not as good as anticipated,"Very basic--- fundamental production values...Should probably go with a video that does not try to superficially cover quite so many styles, but restricts itself to fewer topics but more in-depth coverage and more practice music time....."
4,Works on the Hubby,"I've always been prone to try homeopathic remedies...from teething to my sons acid reflux...so trying this was a no brainer! My husband has a very strenuous job--a tire chain--and is constantly bending and lifting all day (10-12hr days) five-six days a week. I use Arnicare Arnica Gel on his feet at night, and the unscented gel is quickly absorbed and is non-greasy, which is important...who wants to sit around with greasy feet. Now, while he was disappointed there was no immediate relief [as in you put it on and feel better], I did notice he wasn't complaining of pain the next morning...that's an A in my book!"
4,Great product,"This product is great. It brings swelling down almost instantly. The pain relief is mild or about the same strength as Tylenol for me but every one is different. I can't take other anti-inflammatories, but my doctor recommended this one. I have been pleased with it. Though, I wish that it would have a better pain relief effect."
5,The Best,"Received a free sample of this item a while back and couldn't believe how well it worked. Had to come back for the full size when I ran out. No yucky smell, no burn, no freeze. After applying this to my sore knees and/or sore back I go about my business and realize all of a sudden that the pain is gone. Best ever..."
1,Didn't work,Another homeopathic remedy that doesn't do a thing. You might do better with a menthol based rub-on painkiller. I prefer the roll ons.
1,Arnicare Gel to relieve pain,Disappointed in the product. It was recommended to me by a friend but I did not find any refief from this product.
4,The Forgotten,A good read including information about illegal operations that affect the United States.I enjoy the power and tenacity of the hard trained army officer.
3,Nothing to note,Got this from advice from my massage therapist. I used in in my groin region and hadn't noticed anything. I will keep trying and hopefully update.
3,Caution ! Exhaust Header,"Caution ! This is not an exact bolt-on for the 258. My installer had to do some machine work in order to make it fit properly and not leak any exhaust. It's a nice product and helps with exhaust flow but, if your not good a manufacturing parts I would skip it."
1,save your money,"I bought this thermometer and after one use the inside fogged up and could not be read. Of course, drying the inside was next to impossible and since there is paper used for the markings, the paper also got wet and then distorted. Save your money and buy something better."
3,Not a totally useless book,"If you own the Sega Saturn version of Grandia (which is in Japanese) then this book is quite useful, as it retells some of the story as you are going along. Doubtless this will annoy people who have the english version (hence the low scores).As a guide it is quite poor - It does'nt tell you where all the Mana eggs are, and there are no details of the secret areas...but it is a small price to pay for a story synopsis. Get this book if you love the game or if you have the Saturn version - which is the best one ;0)"
5,Mr Larry,This is an great product u can make the pizza perfectly the way you want it a little less done r more done top our bottom wonderful product its our 2 nd one
5,Previous owner and current owner,"Just purchased my second Pizza Pizzaz. We love the product. Fun to use and makes great pizza. The last once lasted about 6 years. Used every couple weeks during that time. Finally stopped turning the pizza. Not sure what went wrong with it.This second one we purchased about a month ago and is working just fine. I have some concerns with the timer. It feels flimsy, but has not caused any problems. I will give an update if problems develop."
2,"burnt outside, mushy inside","I'm surprised at how much praise this pizza oven has received. I have made two fresh and 1 frozen pizza on mine and have been dissatisfied with the results on all of them.First of all making a pizza from scratch is so hard, I wanted to give up at that point. How do they get the crust to be an even thickness?Second, the pizzas cooked terribly, esp the fresh ones. I followed the suggestions <cooking bottom first> but the inside of the crust was so mushy no matter what I did. The bottom crust was burnt, the cheese and toppings burnt, the inside crust mush...yuck!Even the frozen rising pizza came out similarly. I should have stuck with the oven. Plus this is so heavy and takes up so much space"
4,Loved It So Much I bought Three!,"I initially bought one of these because we eat a lot of pizza and I had heard good things about the oven. It more than met my expectations! It bakes frozen pizza so tasty that we have stopped ordering out. We enjoy cooking pig in the blankets on this cooker too. Everything turns out evenly cooked and delicious. The tray is very easy to clean. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because there is no ""off"" switch. It has a switch which allows you to cook using the upper, lower or both ""burners"". (I recommend using the dual setting for everything!) It also has a timer but the tray continues to rotate even after the timer goes off so you must unplug the product to get it to completely turn off. The pros out weigh the cons by far. I liked this item so well that I ordered two more through Amazon for my grown daughters and they love them! This is one of the few small kitchen appliances that you actually will use as often as you store!"
5,PIzzazz works,"Only had 1 small problem and that was square pizzas,they still worked but you have to adjust them abit. otherwise Great product!"
4,my third pizzazz,"Presto has done a good job w/ the Pizzazz. This is my third Pizzazz, as the other two went to college.The only reason for the four and not five star rating is that the finish is not very durable on thecooking surface, ie; when using a Scoth scrub sponge to remove baked on cheese. I like how they have expandedthe recipe possibilities, and look forward to many years of use. Amazon had the best price, and seems to get you the best deal. Dan"
5,Great and useful gadget. So glad we got it.,"We've had this for quite a few months and always appreciate how handy it is. No more preheating the oven. You want a pizza? It's done in 12 minutes. We always let it run on the ""lower"" heat level for an extra 4 minutes to make a crispy crust.I take an organic three cheese pizza and layer on fresh mushroom pieces, fresh red onion pieces, freshly chopped parsley and fresh chopped organic bell pepper. The oven heats up the veggies so nicely. Fantastico!I've used it to make kale chips too.It's easy to store after use and clean-up's a breeze. It's a handy dandy pizza maker."
2,Beware of squeaky gears,"My sister had an older one that was great, so I ordered the newer one.It was not as good as I was hoping. Cooks food well, but the gears are a little noisy. Sometimes it squeaks loudly. I returned the first one because it sounded like a sewing machine and the replacement also had gear noise issues. Im thinking they all may be like that... Overall I was dissapointed after seeing how my sisters older model didn't have these issues."
2,Slow Cooker,"I was disappointed by this cooker. It takes 23 minutes to cook a pizza to my liking in the oven. It takes this cooker 30 minutes to do the same. $50 is a lot to pay for something that doesn't work as well as an oven. Steer clear of this waste of money! It does work, but you need to wait longer for your pizza."
4,Exactly what I hoped!,"I was very impressed with this product. It does a great job of heating frozen pizzas through (I haven't tried it with homemade pizzas, but don't plan to), especially browning the cheese. I didn't give it 5 stars for two reasons: I have had a hard time getting the crust crispy enough for my taste (hopefully with more practice), and if the pizza gets done sooner than the timer was set for, there is no way to turn it off early; you just have to wait the extra few minutes with the pizza maker turned on. Aside from those two small faults, I love this!"
4,Gooood Pizza,"Using the pizza oven is great for frozen pizzas. It is quick and both the top and bottom bakes evenly, better than having to preheat the oven and then not getting top and bottom done perfectly. Easy clean up too!"
5,I love my pizza heater!,"Since I'm always looking for a bargain, I found one of these for sale on the internet not far from home. I only gave $15 for it fell in love with it with the first pizza I put on it. After looking at the prices here, I evidently got a great deal even if it was slightly used. If it broke, I'd buy another one, probably a new one. Is it worth it, heck yeah!! I'm single and live alone, just right up my alley!"
1,Got defective one,"I was going to replace one I have had for years, but this one came and had a defective timer switch that would not turn on."
5,Wonderful Pizza Cooker,"My wife and I received one of these from my parents when we first moved in together three years ago as a house-warming gift. At first, I was a little skeptical - Why would anyone need something like this if they have an oven?Boy was I wrong. This thing is fantastic. It cooks pizza evenly and thoroughly and takes up little space on the counter (we stow ours away when not in use)I will agree with another poster that the pan is hard to clean after cheese, etc gets baked onto it. However, it still works great, doesn't stick and cooks pizza very well.If the cooking plate gets too bad, you can always buy a replacement through AmazonHighly recommended product!"
3,it's okay,To me it's too much work...BULKY my pan gets scratched easy and there are spots that no matter what I can't clean. Pizza'a are pretty good (expecially homemade) but for frozen pizza's it's easier for me to stick in the oven with my SilPat.
5,Presto Pizza Oven,This is a must-have for our family kitchen and the second one that we have purchased. Our first finally wore out after 6-7 years of weekly use. We purchase frozen pizzas and add some extra toppings to personalize them. Actually find these home-baked pizzas more desireable than ordering out!!
5,Presto 03430 Pizzazz Pizza Oven,I love this machine. You just take the frozen pizza & place it on the machine & in 16 minutes you have a piping hot pizza. It is really great. I have used it several times & really love it.
2,Snooze,Quite a low for Lundell this record. It bored me to death when it came out. It is a record of covers that are ill-suited to him. Do not ask me why a man with his talent chose to waste his and my time with this...
4,Fans of this group will love this album to death!!!!!!!!!!!!,"For those who loved three times dope & thought that they fell off, well guess again. The beats are tight and the ryhming of E.S.T. is the E.S.T. the we remembered from ""THE GREATEST MAN ALIVE""!!! Buy this album, because you will find a hard time trying to find this album in any record store!"
4,failed comeback,"this album is by no means a classic,but because i got it for next to nothing i didnt mind what i herd,however if you have herd there classic bangers from back in the day,you will be dissapointed,i get the impression that they tryed once more to reach a broader fanbase,but it never happened,to long in between albums and simply fans forget you.get it if its dirt cheap."
5,My Favorite!,"I was really happy to see this product offered, and I wasn't disappointed when I received it. A very nice fragrance - an air of mystery. I received it in a timely way as well. It is very much worth a try. I'm very pleased with it, and plan to continue to order it."
4,Pretty Average,I think this is a pretty average book. I mean Cap America is my favorite Avenger/Superhero. This is still a pretty good book.
1,Pathetic!,How can they charge so much for the replacement foil? It cost almost as much as the whole unit! One of those ripoff schemes of manufactures that put their profits way ahead of their customer satisfaction. Do not buy this product. It does not work well enough to justify paying so much for a replacement head.
4,Nitpicking,"Dear Amazon,I do not own the album yet, I am going to buy it in the nearest future - I was won over by the lovely rendition of ""Isn't She Lovely"", which was played to me by a friend.Please pardon me for the outburst, but Django Reinhardt was NOT FRENCH. He was a Belgian Roma (""Gypsy""). These distinctions may seem trivial to you, but only if you yourself have never been in a similar situation.Thanks."
4,Well written survey,A fine book that provides a fine overview. The 3-D maps really bring the battlefield alive. This series of books is a must-have for the professional military officer starting out on the military history adventure.
1,Worst product,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I bought this popper yesterday. Read all the directions. All the popcorn popped but it also blew out my microwave and now it is dead and I have to buy a new one today! I read one other lady on here said the same thing. But I thought that maybe she already had a bad oven. Mine was a good one. It also said to make sure your microwave has a popcorn button on it which mine did. You are not supposed to use it with this popper which I didn't. So followed the rules EXACTLY!!I wrote in to the Presto company. Told them what happened and I want to know what THEY are going to do about it. If they don't do anything I am getting in touch with the Better Business Bureau.Want to say I heard back from Presto. They are sending me a $60 check for my old microwave. It was 10 yrs. old. So I thought that was fair. Plus they are sending me a free hot air popcorn popper! The microwave product might not be good but the service there was very good. They were very quick in getting back.
4,Works great BUT ...,Works great BUT I would not have bought this item if I had known that I would have to keep purchasing cardboard inserts called powercups.
2,I prefer Hot popers,"Its OK, but to much against it, you must purchase the bottom piece, it doesn't meet my expectationthe people commenting motivate me but I don't think it deserve the attention its getting, THE AIR POPPERITS A MUCH BETTER DEAL, THIS ONE WILL LEAVE KERNELS UN POP, THE ONLY REASON TO BYE THIS IN MY OPINIONONLY IF THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO DO POPCORN. THEY MUCH BETTER WAYS, I SAY THE AIR POPPER IS MUCH MORE EFFICIENT."
2,NOT the best microwave popcorn popper,"This is NOT the best microwave popcorn popper. We tried this at a friend's house after Christmas, I was raving about my own new popcorn popper (the NordicWare Microwave Microwave Popcorn Popper that WAS available on Amazon) and my buddy wanted to show me his popcorn popper, the Presto popper. (Such is the exciting life of younger married men with small children). He has to use a disposable paper base each time he uses the Presto Popper and the popcorn is not as good. Get the NordicWare instead, much better popcorn and it is just a well-designed piece of plastic with a lid, no gimmicky ""Concentrator"" baloney."
5,It is literally everything I have ever wanted in popcorn,"This is not gross pre-packed microwave popcorn. This is the real deal. You put kernels in the container thingy, put the container thingy in the microwave, have delish real popcorn! Also, container thingy goes in dishwasher. It is literally everything I have ever wanted in popcorn. So, yes, I may have popcorn and wine for dinner with some regularity now."
5,Best Ever!,"This was a purchase I can review with all positives. The popper delivers so much popcorn,that the cover practically comes off. The directions say to start with 5 minutes, but each microwave is different. You must stay near it and not leave it alone, so that you can check the time between pops, and make sure that it is less than 3 seconds, or you can have a burnt offering! I am down to 4:06 and I have about 3 unpopped kernels left in the bowl. This popper is stupendous."
4,good value,"good value. only used once but worked great. only a few kernels didn't pop but since the directions indicated to be careful the first time used, I may have not popped long enough"
5,The Best in PopCorn,"Fast and good delivery, I was tired of using the commercial popcorn in bags and this is the perfect option to make PopCorn at home."
3,Love the Popper where's the replacement cups???,"We really do love the popcorn this little handy thing makes and I even got one for my parent's and they totally enjoy there's, but I guess the big question is where do you buy the replacement concentrator cups. Well guess what they don't sell the product or concentrators anymore. So enjoy them and throw them. One of your other reviewer's stated ""Give the Poloroid away and charge high for the film , same with shaver's etc...""So enjoy this one while you can and then toss it."
5,awesome microwave popper,"I purchased this microwave popper several weeks ago and use it daily. I do not like the idea of the prepackaged microwave popcorn, and this is a great alternative. I use no oil, so the paper disks last through many pops, and I have FAT free popocorn. I would definately recomend!"
3,"Best on the market, But....","Have been using it for years. Tried different types but this is the best so far for microwave popping. I am now concerned about it being BPA free and have emailed the company to see if it is and if not, when will the make them BPA free. As you know, the heat increases the toxicity. No answer yet.Tip: Make your own power concentrators by tracing the original to paper plates and cutting them out. Works just as well, and a whole lot cheaper!"
4,easy snack,"Good product. Works fine using the power cup. I bought it because I wanted to use only locally available bulk organic popcorn (better for health, less paper waste)and less expensive overall. I do cut back on my microwave power to 70 percent to prevent burning. Once I learned by trial and error to do that, I enjoy tender,warm, delicious popcorn frequently, and in around three minutes."
3,"Oh, those pesky power cups!","I received this item as a bonus gift for participating in an online survey program. Like many people here, I can't find those power concentrators to save my life! You'd think that in a metropolitan area of 15 million people I could find the dang things, but I too must order them online. They are available on Amazon and even the Presto home page.My 14-year-old microwave will wear out the power cups almost immediately unless I put at least 1/2 cup of popcorn in the popper and stop the popping when the bowl fills up. That doesn't bother me, because popcorn is cheap and plentiful, and the power cups are not. My boyfriend's newer microwave does a better job, and we eat the popcorn with no salt at all; we find that it has a subtle, nutty flavor."
1,uneven,"We tried this many times. Popcorn would usually burn, pop unevenly. Not very impressed. We purchased a PRESTO plug-in instead and LOVE it!"
5,Love it!,"If you want the taste of stove top popcorn in microwave time, this product is for you. We have had ours for three years now and use it almost every week. We love it."
5,good movie.,I love the old movies. This is one they don't show on TV much. Was surprised to see they had it on DVD. If you like the old movies you should try this one.
4,One of Doug's Better Books,"I have read all of Doug's books and this is one of his better publications. It gives specific, practical action steps and guidance on how to accelerate your marketing success based on his research.Buy it and increase your marketing success.Paul R. DiModicaAuthor of Value Forward Selling - How To Sell Managementhttp://www.howtosellmanagement.com"
3,Good Story/Disappointing Finish,"Few American novels are set in the late Western Roman Empire, so I have been interested in Noyer's work. He has done considerable research to make the 5th century come alive, although there appear to be some anachronisms. I enjoyed the descriptions of daily life in Ravenna.But, there seemed to be no real ending to the story, no resolution to the mystery. Perhaps Noyer meant for his work to imitate life in this respect--not everything being neatly tied up. Or, perhaps, there are answers in ""The Cybelene Conspiracy,"" which I have just begun to read."
1,Rips like tissue paper - not rugged at all,"One small tear in the fabric next to a pocket and the next thing I knew it had grown to almost 9 inches. The material is thin and not substantial enough for a typical day in the brush. Nice design, wrong materials.I had a tailor sew it back up and it ripped again along the new seam. I haven't even washed it yet because I think it would probably shred.I'm sad to report I now have to look at other jackets to replace this one."
5,"GREAT VALUE, GREAT PRODUCT","I agree with others who have reviewed this item that it is a quality product, especially given the low price. It has ample storage for everything except your sleeping bag! In fact, it has so much storage that it can be confusing. My car keys triggered the metal detector at a court house and, though I could feel them, I couldn't find the opening of the pocket that they were in. Finally, one of the officers reached in the appropriate pocket and removed them. (Duh!) So, if you need a durable jacket with lots of storage capacity, and can cope with having so many pockets, don't hesitate to buy this one. I do agree with prior posts, however, that the sizing is a tad on the larger size than usual and the side cinch tabs don't want to stay where you put them--though the latter could be fixed with a stitch of heavy thread or adhesive backed Velcro if that bothers you. In short, a great product, a great price, and a great vendor."
1,Misleading advertising .It is mostly grian alcohol !!,"Just read the label on this product that I purchased. Contains: Certified organic grain alcohol(66-70%),distilled water & Passionflower extracts. Could I not have obtained the same product by going to the local ABC store or perhaps to some moonshiners still ? They do not state in the product description the ingredients.You are lead to believe that you are getting mostly Passionflower extract. This is NOT TRUE ! Save your money ! Do not buy this product !"
5,Great natural alternative to anxiety meds,I LOVE this extract! It really WORKS. I get anxious before shows (im a singer) and I take a dropper full of this and it truly calms me! This is better than any herbal anxiety pill either. Try it!
4,Came as advertised,Order came before scheduled date and was exactly what I ordered. The only reason I give it a 4 is because I think it's over priced for what it is.
4,Black Box,"Pretty good all around, the only tiny problem, is the lid sometimes falls while it is up if not held in place manually. Lots of great storage and seperation for all different types of jewelry."
4,Punk/country? It is possible!,"This is a really fun album. It's a tribute to the Knitters, who did a punk/country album in the 80s that was, itself, a tribute to the Carter Family and other country greats. This album features some great bands (Trailer Bride, The Handsome Family, The Sadies) and one song by the Knitters themselves. People who are into oldtime country or roots music will love this album, because it's a fun twist on the old stuff. People who are into Chicago indie rock and 80s punk will also appreciate this album. It's a real gem."
3,Like the look of it...,"I like the look of the product, but it does not fit the larger drivers as well as described. I have a 460 cc driver and it doesn't fit well at all. I'll probably just stick this one one of my fairway woods. So be careful if your looking to replace your driver head cover."
4,Cholesterol Confusion,"Having recently been diagnosed with high cholesterol,the title of this book caught my eye. The story was interesting, sympathetic, scary. I like the idea of blending recipes with a memoir, but I was utterly shocked at the ingredients in the recipes - butter, eggs, butter, eggs...um...isn't that part of the problem? Still, I enjoyed the story and wish the author and her husband only the best in health."
4,Good value,Not the best sub in the world. Performs pretty well. Give it enough power and you will be surprised. Worth every dollar.
4,Pretty frames,"I was pretty happy with this frame, but to get the picture to float like it does in the pick you need some tape or something on the back."
3,wrong type mount,Unfortunately this particular wall mount was not suitable for the type installation that I needed.. I returned the Vogel mount on the 21st of March and I am waiting for a refund. I have not been informed by the vendor or Amazon if the Vogel TV wall mount has been received and when I should expect a credit.
2,Poor production quality,The content was good but it was painful to watch and listen to. The code samples are not available. The web site doesn't exists.
5,awesome for the 5.56/.223,Cuts cleaning your bore down to just a few seconds. It says for .22 but will obviously work in your .223. Great if your breaking in a barrel and cleaning the bore frequently. Must have.
5,"Better than the movie, itself!","(Well, that's not saying much...it was a pretty bad movie!) But as far as soundtracks go, this one is a winner. Stirring and triumphant with moments of real emotion. Don't let a disappointing movie keep you from owning its excellent soundtrack."
3,Basic ASL instruction,This is a basic ASL teaching book. Very few pictures and mostly information for people teaching beginners ASL. It does have some interesting features that make it worth a glance.
5,Great history of Vegas,This book was great. It steps through the things that happened in Vegas and the truth about the events and people that made this great town.
5,A Family Tradition,"This was originally my album (I'm the mom) 'cause I'm the one into Irish music, but it has become a family tradition in not only the singing but also the listening. My kids (14-6) love the jaunty 'Donkey Riding' and 'Wheel the Perambulator'. My daughter sang 'Warlike Lads of Russia' for a school talent day. We even learned to make colcannon because we love the song so much, and that has now become a family tradition too! A great way to experience music everyone can appreciate together!"
3,not enough by itself,"I just got out of 70-228, having failed for the second time in a row. I used this guide AND the Transcender tests, and still failed. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you say... Must be his fault. I'd be inclined to think so myself, but I'm an MCSE and an MCSD for .NET, part of which was 70-229, and I know the whole certification drill by heart. I've reviewed the areas where I did the worst, looked for the topics in the book, and found the book to have pretty thin coverage. It's still a pretty good book, and the format is effective, hence the 3 stars, but the results speak for themselves. I'm off to the store to see the Micrsoft materials for this topic, which got very rare rave reviews."
3,"Easy to read, but ...","I've not decided to get this one before because i already had a couple of SQL books for the 70-228 (Unleashed, 70-228 for Dummies and SQL in 10 min from Ben Forta) book's reviews were not so good either. But ... i went to a major book store last night and i was able to hold the book on my own hands and read some chapters. My 1st impression, after read a few pages quickly, was a good one. Nice explanations...a lot of graphics (i love that, it helped me a lot when i'm studying) It's the kind of book you like to read and you enjoy the lecture at same time. But ... but ... it is not complete and it just gave a quick brief on most of topics.My advice is to get this one only if you already have another book source too (let's say SQL Unleashed). You simply won't pass using this book only. It's a nice book (EXCELLENT EXPLANATIONS AND GRAPHICS) but can't be your main choice."
5,"Pinky & the Brain, Vol. 2",Classic cartoon fun with Steven Spielberg producing the series. His vision and sense of humor brings creativity that adults will enjoy. A true delight to watch again and again and share with a newer generation.
3,The Battery Killer,"I bought Samsung Digimax S600 6.0 MP, the battery consumption is tooooo much. To take about 50 pictures I had to change the Duracell batteries twice. With rechargable cells (ofcourse the energizer ones meant for digital camera) the max you can take is 20-25 pictures, So if you plan to use this Camera for any important occasion be prepared to carry atleast 3 sets of batteries. It is really frustrating when the battery goes off.The zoom is also not good, better to pay additional 50$ to get a sony or a canon with 4 MP and 5X optical zoom."
5,Good Product for Price,I purchased this for my son and he really likes everything about the camera. He loves the quality of pictures. He did mention the camera has a proprietary cable that hooks to his computer - just an FYI.
4,Tier 1 detector at Tier 3 price,I now have owned this radar detector for a little over a month and it has already saved me a few times. I bought the hard wire kit so it comes on automatically when I start the car. Well worth the extra money. There have been no false alarms and it does not go off when you pass commercial property alarms. So when it does go off you know that it is real! I would highly recommend over paying $500 for the Escort. Good value for the money.
1,This company ripped me off!,"I purchased a radar detector for my husband for Christmas and he returned it because it wasn't the one he wanted. The seller is claiming that a unicycle seat was sent back (we don't even have a unicycle seat!). I contacted the seller and they are now claiming it must have been the Post Office. No, the package weighted 2 lbs 5 oz. (weight of the radar detector). Then, I checked the site from Amazon, and noticed that I had given them a 5 star rating and 'Great Seller!' feedback. YEAH, RIGHT!!! It appears that their system provides automatic feedback after each order...that's why their ratings are so good. Anyway, beware of this site! I'm serious...something's not right with this company and I may have lost $247.00!!!!!!"
1,Bell RX65 Overrated,Bottom line is it gives you a lot of false alarms all the time. Do not believe the advertised claims. It is not better than a $99 cheapo so save your money. It throw off K band warning at stop lights for heaven's sake while you are sitting at the light. What a piece of junk!
1,"Worked for about 1 month, then nothing but trouble since.","The Bel RX65 worked great, for about 1 month. After that, it started flashing ""SelfCal"" and ""Service Requiered"" on the screen. Sent it in to Bel for them to fix the problem. After about 10 days I got the product back, only to have it repeat exactly the same problems again within 2 days of having it. I feel like I've been ripped off, because they either didn't even look at it or they don't know how to test something for a problem. I spent $300 for a detector that doesn't work as well as a $40 one (and I know, I've had both)!I would say I recommend Escort, but I've since learned that they are owned by the same company as Bel. Valentine 1 is too costly, so I guess that doesn't really leave many good detectors on the market."
2,beltronics,Although I was not satisfied with the product the company was really good on returning my money back with no hitten fees. Its range is not as good at it says to be. It gives lots of false warnings and not enough warning mile range.
5,fantastic radar detector,"The Beltronic""s RX65 radar detector is the finest detector i have ever had. I definitely would recommend it to everyone, that want""s to avoid a speeding ticket."
5,"Great product, excellent performance","This radar detector does just that and does it well. Laser and all current bands of radar are all received, usually with more than enough range to allow the driver to check with his/her compliance with posted speed limits to avoid unintentional traffic speed infractions. The auditory and visual rationale used to warn drivers of potential speed examination zones is effective without being overbrearing to occupants of the vehicle's passenger compartment."
2,a boring listen,"I just got this one and I have to say that it isn't very good. Beats are boring, lyrics are ok at times, but most of it feels weak. Now, i admit i really know nothing about the members in this group, nor am I some great hip hop expert at all, but I like my hip hop to create new spaces in my head as i enjoy the elevation powers of trees. I have recently fallen deeply in love with the screw tape stuff coming out of houston. I just got Devin the Dude, To Tha Extreme and I think it is EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!! i hope this helps someone not waste $ they could put into more exciting hip-hop."
3,Not their best effort!,"After Lif dropped Emergency rations and I Phantom he has been number one on my list, closely followed by Lyrics Born and Evidence of Dilated. I have purchased or downloaded every song he has ever made or collaborated on, and I can honestly say that is not his best work. With the exception of Memorial Day and What Have We Got To Lose?!? there is no message or meaning. If you are looking for party filler and cliché hip hop posturing then by all means buy this. However, if you expect anything near I phantom you should look somewhere else."
2,"Tai Chi for Seniors: How to gain flexiblity, strength, etc.",It doesn't contain step by step pictures on how each movement is performed. So far I have not found it as helpful as I thought it would be.
1,JUNK -- Broke 1/2 way through 1st use,"Title pretty much says it all. Bought this knife for Christmas prime rib. It was a 10 lb prime rib, but I wasn't misusing the knife or forcing it in any way, and it simply broke half way through the VERY FIRST USE! One of the clips that holds the knives in place apparently broke off, because after I finished cutting up the prime rib manually, someone found the broken piece while eating.I had read the reviews beforehand, and though ""boy, it can't be that bad."" And, man, was I wrong.PIECE OF JUNK!!"
1,Not happy,"Had an oster electric Knife for 34 years gave me great service finally broke down,so I figured I'd buy another one. Wrong,didn't make it 15 minutes before breaking while cutting a ham. Seems that where the blades are connected inside the knife broke. Although I realize that It could be a fluke, I don't think I'll buy another."
1,oster electric knife-not satisfied,"I had a Black & Decker electric knife for years, had I realized how bad the Oster knife cut I would have stuck to my Black & Decker. Very disappointed."
3,"Good explanatory answers, but an unreal amount of typos!","I found the study guide to be somewhat useful, but I wasted quite a bit of time trying to figure out arithmetic problems where there were typos in the question itself, the explanation, or both. It took me much more time than it should have on numerous math exercises simply because I kept trying to figure out why my answer was ""wrong"". Then of course there were a lot of garden variety misspellings (which didn't affect my studying but reflected poorly on the quality of the book). I hope the 18th edition is better, not that it will help me any."
4,Great tool,This book is really great! It shows me how to do the math problems so it is a great review! The person who I had bought it from though had already marked all of the answers in the book so I am having to erase them all.
4,Wonderful standards,This is a most enjoyable rendering of well-known jazz pieces. Perfect for evening listening. Wonderful musicianship and very good recording too!
3,Decent for the price,"I got this for about $16 and it works like a charm. And for that price its a great deal. Kinda cheap feeling though, but what do you expect for this price."
5,Memory maker,"I bought it when my daughter was little, knowing that Collin Raye was a country singer, liking some of his material. We listened to it non-stop; my daughter memorized the words, and sang along in her little voice. When my son came along, we shared the music with him, and he loved it as well. Over the course of the years, the CD was lost, and I was unable to find a replacement...until now. When I showed my now 14 year old daughter, she was delighted: ""Oooo, get it mom! I loved that stuff! It was my childhood!"" How could I not??"
3,Not worth the price.,"This documentary about sharks isn't very sharky. There are a lot of time spent showing other see creatures other than sharks. You start off with a sea turtle introducing himself and taking you on the shark tour. You get to see around five or six different kinds of sharks and learn a few facts about where they roam and what they eat, but I think I learned more about the creatures they ate rather than learning about the sharks themselves. The 3D effects are pretty cool to watch and sometimes it's like I'm looking through a window under water. The documentary is also pretty short coming around to about 42 minutes. If this was a DVD and not a 3D Blu Ray, I think the most I would pay for it would be $5. For this maybe $10."
2,Confusing,"While Cherryh has a wonderful and refreshing style that I found entertaining, the story was confusing. Names and places were being shot out at such a quick pace that it was hard to keep it straight. However, once I read about half of the book, things started to make sense. It is a good story, but takes some time and effort to become interested in and to understand. My advice if you are reading this book....be patient. While things may not be clearly explained, you should be able to reason it out before too long."
4,"Nice product, good luck getting your rebate","The product is just great. Easy to use, easy to configure and [inexpensive]. I strongly recommend it. HOWEVER you have to be very persistent to get your rebate. I don't know if it's because they're understaffed or if they're hoping that people will forget or get bored. Anyway, it has taken me almost four months of chasing them before they said the check has been sent. I'm wondering why I haven't received it yet...They would have 5 stars if they were serious with the rebates."
3,"Looks good for home, no good for NFS","I have a Netgear RT314 for home, and bought this for the office to give me more ports and to allow me to use DHCP at work as well as at home. Very easy to configure. Easy to configure it with my old fixed IP address etc. to spoof my static IP laptop. Worked fine on general stuff (web browsing, email etc.) but I could not get Hummingbird NFS Maestro client to work through it to map NFS drives. First of all my NFS client complained of ""will not work with weak security"", so I configured my laptop to be DMZ to enable all port access, no filtering.At this point it did not return the same error, but could not map the drives (I think it timed out or something). I have no time to mess around with tech support, expecially for something so ""weird"" as NFS where I would expect to get not much help from tech support.It's going back to the store. Maybe great for you, expecially for home use, but no good for me."
3,trying to do too much ?,"I gage this little box 3*. Reason: the switch works fine, but whenever anyone prints anything, the box hangs up and noone can get out into the Internet. I've been in touch a number of times with SMC support- they've been very responsive, replying within a copuple of hours even late on a weekend. So far, nothing helped. YTheir last suggestion was to ""upgrade the ROM"". Haven't treied this yet.Anyone else having this problem ? For [the money]for juast a 4-port switch, it is not a bad deal. Without the rebate tho, I would reconsider."
3,Great Western Themes,"The orchestra generally gives a fine treatment to the themes they perform but I do not agree with their selection. Soundtrack themes from Glory, Gettysburg and The Last of the Mohicans are not, to me, true westerns. Yet they miss Blazing Saddles and ""Do Not Foresake Me"" from High Noon."
3,a rare item,I read this book in the very early '60's. An English teacher suggested it for some reason. I'd love to find a paperback copy.
3,Loved the product but...,They forgot to give me a n inside DVD Jacket so I was sad. The Blue edition had one and honestly the packaging could have been better. Otherwise that was my only complaint because Gackt is awesome. These music videos are awesome. It's not his fault someone forgot my CD jacket and used waaaay too big a box for those DVDs.
3,Product not yet received,I have not yet received the product.Please look into the matter and do the needful as soon as possible.RegardsDebjeet Bhattacharya
3,Different pen,Wanted to try something different. It may work for some people but I find no advantage in using it.
3,Positives might outweigh the negatives,"Positives:1. It does make a significant difference in keeping your hand from getting tired when you write a lot.Negatives:1. The pocket clip, which you push slightly to one side to loose the retractable tip, wears out the edge of the tiny hook that keep the tip retracted and the writing point exposed, so the tip pops out spontaneously while you're trying to write and covers the writing point. Very annoying.2. The metallic paint on my pen chipped off a little in the most-touched places, exposing the gray plastic underneath.3. That price...ouch. Don't forget to take into account the shipping!"
5,LOVE this book!,"This is one of my favorite books of all time. I've read it twice in the last 20 years. His mindset is so entertaining and the things he says crack me up. It's also fun to see what celebrity gossip of the 70's and 80's (before Extra, TMZ, etc.). He was such an eccentric guy and I loved it."
4,Great BUT,"Eddie Kochak is great. This album is great for dancing and instruction. BUT the transfer was sloppy. My dance teacher has the original vinyl version of this album, and we both have the CD. There is a point in Nila where the recording skipped during the transfer and nobody bothered to correct it! Since we both have the same skip in both CDs we can verify this isn't a one-time fluke. The producers really need to pay closer attention when they update older music to new formats."
1,Blithering inanity,"This book, like most fictions, is about personalities and social interactions. There is no requirement that an author create likeable personalities or nice interactions, and Barthelme demonstrates that here. Actually, he has gone out of his way to create disagreeable characters, chronically drifting and unskilled. The dialog is banal and jittery, reflecting speakers' shallowness and irrelevance. Characters talk past--not to--each other.Sequences are unpredictable and implausible, as though lives are completely out of personal control. Needing a plotline? Invent your own. If you are looking for existential anomie, this may satisfy you, although you might save some time by just reading a bunch of newspaper classified ads."
4,Going climbing at Devils Lake?,This is THE book to get if you are going to Devils Lake to do some climbing. It has good descriptions of how to get to the major climbing areas and diagrams of different routes in each location with difficulty ratings.
2,Subpar,"After receiving this guide, I went to Devil's Lake and put it to use. I found the climbs were hard to find based on the sketches in the book. Since then I have checked out a few other guides and found them much much more helpful. I recommend finding one of these guides that actually provides photographs of some of the climbs so you can get your bearings."
4,interesting variety,"There are a variety of authors included in this book, some of whom I was rather surprised to see in such ""hardcore"" surroundings, not always pleasantly. A few of the stories are titillating and interesting while some (toward the end of the book)belong in the last few Hot Blood books along with the rest of the erotic horror schlock. But the good stories by the truly talented authors are what make this book worth reading and owning."
3,not bad,"Not bad. Was expecting more on Godel's actual work. Rather, the reader gets a detailed overview of the period's work in mathematics and physics."
1,Book is NOT about Godel's Timeless Universe,"I feel this book is a fraud. I spotted it at a Border's going-out-of-business sale (boo-hoo!) The front and back cover's indicate this is about Godel's rotating universe solution to Special Relativity. In fact, only about 20 percent of this book is devoted to that, and that 20% is, scientifically, very thin. (No math, no light-cone diagrams, etc.) The rest is about Godel's and Einstein's personal histories, their relationship and Godel as philosopher. A waste of time for me."
2,some old books are just old,"I first read this book for a school project when it was first published 14 or 15 years ago when I was in elementary school. As a child I enjoyed the book very much because it had huge print, lots and lots and lots of pictures (although they're all black and white) and a short, easy-to-follow story that was very basic and to-the-point. When I recently reread this book I couldn't believe how amateurish and juvenile Donald Spoto's overall writing is. For children wanting to read a celebrity biography ""Rebel"" is highly recommended as the language and writing is at best at a 6th grade level. However, for anyone else, though, I think there would be many other more engaging books, not to mention dozens and dozens on the life of the legendary actor, Mr. Dean (may he rest in peace)."
1,the uncensored story of marilyn monroe is not here it is in here i am mother,Here i am mother by nancy miracle is the only uncensored story of the human behind the image Mr. Guiles tells the same old story and never researched beyond the newspapers but he tried i suppose the only person who knows and is able to reveal the copyrighted story is her daughter nancy miracle a playwright and member of the dramatists guild
2,Confusing Book,I've seen much better. Uses many confusing terms. For advanced body builders only. Black and White Pictures deminstraight poor quality.
4,UPS bad service,"I ordered this. From the looks of things, this is definitely a 4 star shoe. OF course, I can't say because UPS lost this shoe in shipping. It never made within 500 miles of my house. Tragic loss of a shoe that could've been places."
1,Split after 90 days,"I love this spatula. But after just a few months usage, it split in two places. I expected more longevity."
3,"Good book,but too much on his side!","It is a good book and a good read, but it is too much in his favor in my opinion. It talks about his childhood to after the shooting. I feel like it has too much sympathy for him when it should be to his victims. I read the book when I was a freshman in Pearl High School. I was in elementary when the shooting happened and I'll always remember hearing the news and reading about it in People magazine. I just feel like the book was a great insight to what lead up to this tragedy but it should've been less sympathetic towards him and more to the victims."
5,"""crowing about this album""","This is my first review for Amazon. This is a great album, very thoughtful and full of feeling. I've listened to other albums by Allison which I would classify as country and would'nt buy. This one is more in the folk tradition which I like. I'd characterize her style as a cross between Tft Merritt's folk rock and Mary Chapin Carpenter's folk storytelling. This album makes you think about life and times and relationships in your past. It's definitely more melancholy than upbeat, but it's not a downer, either."
3,Beautiful voice but songs are average,"It's painful to give AM less than a stellar review. She has such an amazing voice which is velvety, rich, dusky, and technically near perfection. The songs are problematic on Crows. They aren't very memorable and one in particular is really awful. The choice to record with a piano was a good one as she has the voice to pull it off. Next time more variety in terms of tempo would help. This is just too much of a slog that never really goes anywhere. She sounds a bit like Ann Wilson of Heart in places, Marti Jones in others."
4,Simple oriental tale,"The guide is a very much appreciated work of RK Narayan. There aren't any twists in the plot. It is a simple smooth story with a great climax. Good for light reading but provides insight into the indian thought process. There has also been a movie made in Hindi ,named guide based on RK's story. First read the story, form a picture of the plot then when you see the movie you can know how diferent movies can be from the story they intend to tell.A good read for people interested in knowing India. That applies for RK's most books."
5,Unicorn Vol. 1,"Gundam Unicorn is how the universal century should be written! just a tremendous story line to suck the audience in. At times i wish they would re-do all of the old UC films with this type of calaber, perhaps that would put the life back in some gundam fans. They did a good job and cant wait to see how the series finishes out."
2,Not for car seat,"Purchased this item for traveling. Our son doesn't travel well. So we purchased this item for him and it doesn't strap on to the car seat like the picture shows. The straps are material and velcro on the ends. How do you attach these straps? So, now we just let him play with it being free. It doesn't attach."
3,An average toy,"My son received this as a gift at age 8 mos. We used it in the car but he could never reach it. When we turned his car seat around to face forward, it was useless. I'm sure it would work on a stroller or in a crib. It's soft, cute and colorful, but not worth the [$]."
3,You get what you pay for!,"Altho this joystick is made by gravis it is one of the company's low end/low price items, and not worth the money unless you use it for kindeling. All in all this joystick is a piece of garbage to be hammered apon!Happy Gaming!!!"
4,A MUST for any serious mixtape lover!,"Mark's choice of tracks and style of mixing is impeccable. Much love to the man from San Frandisco/Chicago. Not TOO much vocal house, but enough to keep you rockin'. Tracks from Mood II Swing and others make this CD the Dope. Not only does the man rock on two decks, he slams on THREE!! Definitely a great effort."
3,Good for .Net (C#) developers integrating COBOL for .NET,This is a handy book when a developer skilled in C# or other .net needs to integrate C# objects with existing Fujitsu COBOL for .Net. It gives insights into modifying legacy COBOL code to be able to accept newer code. The book also give ideas (not specifics) on how to break up legacy code into more manageable chunks to be used by other objects/assemblies and applications.NOTE: this is NOT a book to learn COBOL -- ANY other COBOL book is better -- nor is it a book to teach .NET . This book provides work-arounds on how to develop with what you have (Legacy Code) and a way to use what is new (C#/.Net).I use this as a primary reference in this way and it works.
5,A well written tale of one person's victimization.,Mr. Hall did an excellent job sharing his experience with one of Houston's wealthiest families and the press.
2,Real Definitions is by far the Real Testament,"Plies has a phenomenal underground and street presence on the strength of his infamous mixtapes and live shows. He is a real life block hugger who happened to learn how to tell his story in rhyme. If you want it on the real check out the new Plies mixtape ""REAL DEFINITIONS"". That's the real testament!"
2,Too much missing from a great HK film,"Although a great mix of action and drama, this movie made in the mid-80s, which has recently seen the light of day in the states, is missing too much. This movie is missing about 2 fight scenes that add nearly 10 minutes. Two fight scenes mean too much missing. Some of the action in the finale was deleted also. Where would a Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Hong Kong action film be without numerous fight scenes? Some of the music has been changed or taken out that enhanced the mood of the scenes. I am a great fan of Jackie Chan and Hong Kong cinema but I am tired of seeing fantastic action films cut of their action. This movie would have been 5 stars had it not had too much missing."
2,"Sorry Jackie, but to much acting.","This is a good drama if your not a jackie chan fan, otherwise it's not that good of a movie. Well acted for those without expieriance."
4,"More than just a good action movie, but good all around.","This is a poignant look at the relationship between two brother of which one is mentally handicapped. I thought that Crime Story was the only movie that showed Jackie's acting talent until I saw this one. Sammo Hung is very good also. Basically Jackie plays a cop whose aspirations are put on hold by his brother who he must look after. Eventually his brother gets mixed up in his work ends up being held hostage. The story is exceptional and still leaves room for a mesmerizing fight scene at the end, in which Jackie take care of his brother's kidnappers. A definite must for anyone."
3,Haunting and different,"I picked this book for our book club (end of last year) and had searched and searched for the 'perfect' book. What drew me to the book were the vivid descriptions the book was supposed to have. I agree - that part was true, but the only reason I gave it a 3 was that it just didn't go over big at all with my club. Our of 8 members, only one really liked it. No one else really 'got' the story, though it is hauntingly and beautifully written. I felt bad because I so wanted to pick a book everyone would just swoon over and they just gave me weird looks."
1,Too many cliches. Intelligent readers should avoid.,"I was attracted by the good reviews. However the writing is formulaic..you can pick the good guys and the bad guys fairly quickly. And there is double cross after double cross...one yawn. And almost of course there is the ""ultimate betrayal"" near the end...double yawn.The characters are one dimensional. The attempt to make the story interesting by running different time lines is amateurish.And OK maybe just maybe you could make a helicopter invisible. But there is no attempt to explain how it was made SILENT. Just not good enough.Possibly OK for a brainless read on a long flight."
2,literary equivalent of a Jerry Bruckheimer film,"I have to admit right off that I only got about a hundred pages into this novel before I quit. Though the premise was interesting (Mooney is very knowledgeable about technology), Mooney falls short in the psychology department. His characters lack convincing depth and detail, and I felt like I was reading a novelization of a Hollywood movie. The fact that he took a couple chapters to describe a parachute jump didn't help. I just didn't feel it was worth the time and effort to slog through another 400 pages."
1,Not what I expected!,"Didnt realize this was erotica. Also didnt realize that some authors consider pedophlia as ""erotica"". This is now resting in my trash can! Sorry but I was told this person was a great author and I purchased this not knowing the content. Im very open minded but never to men exposing themselves to children or fathers molesting children. WOW!I was pleased with the speed of the shipping and transaction but that is all."
3,More like vignettes than short stories,"""Little Birds"" was my first foray into the world of Anais Nin. I haven't decided, after reading this, whether I like this or not. On one hand, I love her use of the English language, her spare style, her sense of character and story-telling. On the other hand, too many of the stories presented here ended abruptly, with no real sense of resolution or how the characters got from point A to point B. The most glaring example is in the story ""The Model,"" in which we get detailed descriptions of the narrator's first two would-be lovers, but almost nothing about the third guy. Flaws aside, this little volume is probably the best way to get acquainted with Nin without investing too much."
5,Very sturdy!,"Very heavy and sturdy. Glad it has a handle on both sides. Rough around the edges, but that doesn't really ruin the integrity of the cast iron. Bought a bamboo stir fry spatula to go with it for my son who loves to cook. He loves it and uses it a lot."
1,This is a novel?,"I guess I really don't get this book. It was meant to be a ""go green"" story about how coffee is and should be produced. That part I get. But the writing seemed simplistic and offers no insight whatsoever into the characters. It is simply a Dick and Jane book. Now I have read another book by Alvarez and enjoyed it immensely and I realize this simple style is what the author intended. But the language is not creative in any way and just seems cobbled together to lead to info at the end about the plight of Dominican campesinos and merchandise info at the end that sell the organic brand of coffee beans the cooperative owned by Alvarez and her husband. The story in and of itself is not literature in any way. had alvarez used her considerable literay skills to craft a 300 page novel on this topic with character depth and advanced plot, I would have loved it."
4,WELL MADE SLASHER / SHOCK MOVIE,"This movie was quite a surprise! An effective new slasher movie that isn't so predictable and is actually very intense in certain scenes. All you need to know is that a group of beautiful women go for a weekend hike in the woods and run into some very nasty situations. I'm not giving anything away here and urge fans of slasher flicks set in the woods to check this one out! Beware though...some people may be offended by a couple of squeamish rape scenes with tied up girls but the violence is never glorified and the suspenseful ending is a real nail biter worth seeing. This isn't some micro budget flick. The production values are great and the cinematography is excellent. At times it reminded me of 'The Descent' (but without the creatures). There aren't a lot of special effects on display as the movie is more suspenseful and shocking than gory, but what is shown is indeed gruesome. For fans of solid creepy / suspenseful slasher movies that aren't predictable."
2,new edition has terrible production quality,"I've owned the 1993 edition for many years but a recent roof leak ruined my copy so I ordered the new edition. Big mistake: the contents are excellent but the fourth edition is printed on trashy paper that you can see right through, and the illustrations and beautiful photos in the 93 edition are ALL GONE. Get the older edition for a lot less money and you'll have a much higher quality printing. If you really want to cover the last couple decades, get some other book - maybe Robert's History of the 20th century.The book is going back on Monday...."
5,Build on this foundation,"What a vast and intimidating undertaking that was handled gracefully. This is an overview of the history of the world; sometimes broad, sometimes more detailed. The reader must remember that this book is intended to discuss countries, peoples, and events that, in the author's mind, shaped the world. This is not a review of the history of every country. The more insular countries or peoples will not be covered in great detail as they are, by definition, less likely to have an impact on the world outside of their own.This book really helped me to develop a broad understanding and foundation. Now I can take that and read about the countries or events that interested me the most in much greater detail. I highly recommend this book."
4,Afropop Overview,"This was a great blast from the past for me, having spent time in Kenya in the 1980s. Wonderful upbeat rhythms"
5,continuous and discrete linear systems,The book is excelent for people who start to study linear systems.
3,Nice brad pins but bad packaging!,"Brad pins work great with my pinner, but loose 2 stars because the package had 4 strips that had been broken up in some way because they were loosely packed in the package. When I got the Grex amd PC ones, they wee all wedged in tightly with some cardboard shims so there was no room to shift. I have about another $170 worth of 23ga pins/brads coming stil from senco, grex, porter cable, and cadex. Hope no more will be like this."
4,scary,I saw this movie as a young child and it traumatized me. Just watched the remake and it's still scary.
3,Doesn't hold up,"Too bad they don't allow half-stars, because I would've given this one 2-1/2. I also watched this movie when I was a child (10 yrs old at the time) and remember it scaring me. Times were more innocent then however, and this movie doesn't hold up to today's films. My 14 yr old daughter laughed at how cheesy the ""monsters"" were and at the story as a whole. I understand they are re-making this film. Hopefully, the updated version will be better."
2,"Meh, not so good.","If you didn't catch this on television when you were younger, skip this movie.It isn't bad, but it runs like a better episode of 'Tales from the Dark Side'. I can easily see how this film could stick with people, especially if they saw it when they were young.I didn't get a chance to see this on television, and in my pursuit of decent creepy movies, picked this up. It won't be staying in my collection. The bulk of the reviews here are based on nostalgia and not on any real content.There is very little, if any plot, no explanation for what's happening and it simply lacks the depth of story that I would have expected with such strong reviews.I thought this dvd would sit next to Burnt Offerings, Legend of Hell House and others in my collection. It won't, it will be sitting on ebay.If you're a horror buff, you may want to look elsewhere."
4,Looks good and is still creepy!,This is the best video quality version of this movie I have ever seen. It is still creepy after all these years.
1,Don't Be Afraid of the Dark,"More likely be afraid of this film. It is the silliest film I've ever seen. No scarey bits, I even laughed when they revealed the antagonists. This should be in comedy not horror. Also the quality of the film is really bad on a plasma screen. Sorry guys if you are after a good horror film this is not it."
4,EFFECTIVE AND EERIE TV MOVIE IS GREAT FUN! FINALLY ON THE DVD!,"This movie....a TV movie at that! Is one of the creepiest little films from that time period. It is certainly one of the best TV movie ever made and the little humanoid demons are unforgettable. Sally......Sally we're coming for you Sally! I found this film through Warner Archives for $12.98 with free shipping. The film is tame by today's standards, but makes for a great Halloween film. It's full of eerie atmosphere and those unforgettable demons. I deduct 1 star because the acting is below average at times, but this is a very cool little horror film. This and Bad Ronald are available through Warner, but the DVD's are burned and they do not offer any extras. The picture quality is OK, these are old films that most people do not care about, so if you want it buy it. It probably will never see any better care."
4,"Review of the DVD itself, not the film","I just received this DVD-R and watched it last night and wanted to share my thoughts. First off, Amazon states this DVD is ""manufactured on demand"" but it sure didn't seem like it! It shipped really quickly and was shrink-wrapped so it looked like a real DVD release. The DVD itself working fine in my Bluray player and the menu had a simple Play option and instructions to hit the forward and back buttons to go back and forward 10 minute intervals. The movie itself looked pretty good considering its age! There were a few specs here and there and it obviously had not been cleaned up or remastered, but it wasn't bad at all. Yes, some scenes were dark but this is the way they lit the movie; it is nothing to do with the transfer. All in all, this DVD-R was a great purchase and I'm glad I bought it!"
2,Don't be Afraid of the Dark - Too dark,"I remember this movie freaking me out when I first saw it many years ago and I know that when revisiting stuff from childhood as an adult, things aren't always as scary or as good as one remembers. Having said that, I felt that even though it still had some of that creepiness that I remember, this copy was so dark that you really couldn't see the creepy crawlers unless the camera closed in on them and in some scenes could not see Kim Darby at all. That took away from the enjoyment."
5,Don't be afraid of the dark,"I was about 8 years old when I first saw this movie and it was and still is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. I watched it with my two older brothers and it was an experience that has left an impact on me. My brothers knowing how scared I was after seeing the movie conspired to scare me even more by placing a tape recording under my bed one night of the creatures calling my name. I will never forget that night and neither will my parents as my screams were ear piercing. That said I remember the movie fondly and hope to one day see it again although I have the feeling that it won't be the same, somehow watching those movies that we watched as kids doesn't have the same effect as it did when we first saw them."
5,Want to see this film again!!!!!,"I saw this film many years ago and thought it was really scary. I was in my twenties when I saw it and I've never forgotten it. Recent films just don't match up to this, so I would love to see it again, so I always look out for it on tele but it never shows up. Would love to buy the video (normal sort of price!) so anyone out there who knows where to get it, tell us on this site. Can't wait to see if I would still enjoy it. PS A friend of mine also found this film really great, and there aren't many films that phase her."
4,Favorite Elemental Masters Book,"My favorite book of this series, which is why I replaced it when my first copy wandered off. Particularly appreciated the reminders of how women were treated in the not so distant past and of the courage many of them displayed in demanding changes. Don't worry, you won't be preached at! It's part of the story, but there's plenty of adventure, suspense and some light romance. OK for teenagers, but too scary for kids and anyone afraid of snakes."
4,"""The Evilest Man in the World"" is not the actual villian","While this book is a good read for Lackey fans, I would caution anyone who is only neutral on her writing to avoid it if you're fond of the writing of Aleister Crowley (a magician of some noteriety who is a contemporary of these characters). Peter and his fellow magicians go out of their way to gripe, grumble, and growl about the man. While it's a common attitude for a magician to hold in that time period, it interfered with my enjoyment of the book."
2,She's Going Down Hill,"I have been reading Lackey for years now. While I have enjoyed her Valdemar Series (at least the first six books of it) and the first couple of her Bardic Circle series she seems to have run out of things to say. Her previous effort involving the 'elementals' The Fire Rose was very entertaining. I find this one contrived and wan in comparison. I had high hopes for the 'second' book in the series, figuring she would still make the effort to tell a good story, but I think she's getting tired."
2,Misty Lacking,"I've been a fan of Misty Lackey's books for a long time, but this one fell short. The Sayers references were altogether too blatant, for one thing. What annoyed me the most is Peter's reference to Ankhsenamun, wife of Tutankamun, and the four lovely goddesses with her face that guarded his tomb. The tomb was discovered in 1922, and this story is set in 1909. Since the suffragette scholarship was so sound (a good point for the book), how did a huge anachronism like this get by?? It colored the story for me badly enough to spoil my enjoyment. She needs to write about some more interesting villains as well, not just ones who are bad because they are bad. Shivani had some promise in that regard, but that aspect of her character was never really developed, just hinted at. She could have been far more interesting."
4,Nostalgia vs. memory,"I loved The Adventures of Superman--when I was 10 or 12. It remains great fun, but the material is dated, and lacks an adult level of interest. The transfer is mediocre at best, meaning no one bothered to digitally enhance the print. So now I have the entire collection, and anyone born in or after 1947 will enjoy this as a nostalgic snapshot, but no more than that! js"
5,THIS WAS SUPERMAN WITH CHARISMA!!!,"This is the DVD for all Superman Fans the world Over!!! When you look at these classic episodes, I want you to take a good look at the Man that portrayed the Man of Steel and keep an open mind. Look closely at his acting and the dual roles and interpretations of Clark Kent/Superman. You will begin to see that this was no ordinary man that was blatantly selected to put on those famous tights and go through the motions for 6 years. No, What makes the Adventures of Superman is the Magnetic appeal of that Great actor George Reeves. He convinced a whole generation that He was Superman! that it was not cool to be a crook. He became the personification of Superman! He is now beloved throughout the World!Noel SerranoGeorge Reeves Group-hi5 NetworkPlease Join the George Reeves Group on Yahoogroups and the Hi5 Network!"
1,This product is a scam!,"I purchased this product for 40$ at a differant retail store for my AudioVox Mp1000 Mp3 Player. The product and its reviews state ""Guaranteed compatibility with any MultiMediaCard device""That is a complete lie, every time I tried using the card it would say ""Please connect the Mp1000."" Since the box was opeaned I never got a refund. When I tried my friend's Hitachi Card to see if the palyer was defective, it worked."
4,Kuh's Precious Is Good And Pleasant,"Kuh's initial efforts for a U.S. released CD entitled Precious has her singing songs in an entirely different way than I am used to. This CD is pleasant to the ears and has many 'hooks' in terms of melodies. Kuh's voice has been better explored in her CD of wonderful standards and big band music entitled Unforgettable. Her artistry and vocal range is much better in the latter CD. In fact, if you need to get another CD aside from Precious, let it be Unforgettable. She has an unforgettable voice."
5,Kuh Ledesma.One of the greatest divas of the last two decades!,Wow!What a captivating voice.It is is a real shame that her album has not been promoted any more than this.Her depth and range equals or exceeds Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey.This album is among my 10 most important for a lifetime. Review by Freeman Harry Matthews 7/28/05
1,"Agree with"" Dissapionted""","I am very sorry I got this CD, way too Opreratic, and yes uncontrolled vebrato. I cannot recomend this CD."
4,Stunning,"The stories were great. Well written, poignant, the most so being the one involving the tank."
4,VERY INTERESTING !,"very interesting book;'i 've personnally practised karate and others martial arts for years, and it's not only to grow!you can learn inside a real way of life, being well every day"
4,paradise...,"it was an overall fun game... had i had a faster computer it would have been more fun... but i got through it ok... i finished it in a couple of days which was slightly disappointing. the end of the game could have been more plesent i thought but w/e. and there were some parts i had to look at aa walkthrough to get passed them because you couldnt use common sense to get through (there's one point where you are hanging in a basket and you have to get a stick from one side of you and hit the beehive on the other side, you would think that to get the basket to swing you would rock back and forth but you have to just click one direction and then let go when it hits it climax...) here's the walkthrough i used: [...]"
2,Glorified rubber band slingshot,"Aside from making noise, this is not much more than a glorified rubber band slingshot. I thought the web actually shot out of the blaster, but you basically snag and sling it from the top of the blaster. I thought my son would love it since he's very into Spiderman, but he was bored very quickly. As another reviewer commented, it will make a nice addition to a Spiderman costume come Halloween."
2,Not what I needed,"It arrived with a gash in it - poor packaging. I thought I could live with it though - WRONG. It didn't hold my knives very well, causing the handles to lean downwards. This is a pretty big unit. I wound up giving it away to a co-worker. He didn't like it too well either. Last I heard it was going in his wood stove. Utter waste of money on my part."
3,Shipping....whoa!,"I was going to purchase this item because of the long slots for my big anolon knives then I noticed the shipping price. Is this thing made out of lead? where is the super saver option? standard shipping is only 2.50 a pound, not 3.40.I will find this somewhere else."
5,"Beautifully Melodic, Compelling Album","So much better than ""It Still Moves."" Ranges from thick Neil Youngish reverb layered vocals to spare whines over a banjo to good solid atmospheric southern rock. If John Lennon were reincarnated as a guitar in a southern rock band, it would sound like this."
5,Dale Carnegie Scrapbook,"Dale Carnegie's Scrapbook is a fabulous collection of some of this great author's best insight. The book will likely captivate the reader from cover to cover, yet even a brief sampling of a randomly chosen page will yield enormous satisfaction and glad contemplation."
1,A poor excuse for a map in a world of better options,"I'm a resident of bangkok and like to pick up different maps to see which I like best. I was shocked at what a poor job this one does- and the small area it covers (doesn't even go to my house, and I live in the heart of the city!)While I do use lonely planet's bangkok book, as well as the ""thailand"" guide, this is not worth the postage to get it to you.As an alternative,and of a same size and weight, is my preferred map- the ""groovy map"" which is full of helpful hints and has hotels, restaurants, attractions labeled and reviewed. The insight flexi-map is also an OK choice. If you don't mind carrying around more than one map, the nancy chandler series is a good secondary resource, especially in all things shopping!"
5,Musical excellence,"After his untimely death (at the age of 40) in 1992, Heard was described by singer-songwriter Bruce Cockburn as ""my favorite songwriter."" It's no wonder. I have been listening to Mark Heard's music since his 1979 APPALACHIAN MELODY, and will unshamedly say that he was the best of the singer-songwriters of his era. His music is eclectic, but always crisp and excellent. And his lyrics reveal a man of deep feeling, who felt the pain of a fallen world but still held to an abiding faith. Five stars is not enough."
4,The best musician that nobody listens to!!,"Mark Heard is one of those musicians and songwriters that noone seems to know about. And that's a shame, because he has very thoughtful lyrics as well as being a tremendous musician. When Mark passed away back in 1992 (hard to believe its been that long) I had hoped that maybe more people would check out his music. I don't know if that's happened or not, but I would recommend that everyone take some time, get a hold of this CD, and listen to it a few times. Really listen to what he is saying, don't just play the music for background noise. I can almost guarantee you'll appreciate the talent that this man was blessed with."
4,Special book for older dogs -Owner of Aspenbloom Pet Care,"I've worn out my copy of this book! Jean Callahan really puts it all together for the owner of an older dog. From what to feed, to how to prevent illness this book is not only easy to read through but has a load of resources available. All the illustrations and sidebars, tips, and charts make this book a real handbook for older dog owners. If you have an older dog, get this book and keep it handy because it's a wealth of information.Kim Bloomer[...]"
1,bottom line is the dollar,"It costs less to make a dvd then to make a vhs, and at four episodes a dvd, you are getting jipped. I agree with the one who said ""being nickel and dimed to death."" It is true!179 episodes breaks down into 45 dvds, averaged at $12 a dvd that is $540. I don't have the space to store 45 dvds on Lucy alone; I do have other movies I would like to own. The price is also a little steep. I would rather have it season by season, and at $50 a season, that is still only $300. That is a better deal for storage and value.As long as people continue to spend the money, we will never see a decent amount of Lucy episodes on a decent priced dvd.We need to stand up as consumers and stop giving in to the studios by buying these overpriced dvds.It appears that the diehards are going to kill it for everyone. I think that is sad. Lucy would have wanted more people to enjoy her show on dvd."
2,Staging book,"The book itself contains some good information - if basic. It does not present ideas for furniture arranging. The video gets better toward the end, but a lot of time is wasted while the author walks around and chats. I found it difficult to sit through. It would have been alot better if it clearly presented before and after shots with improvements - and simply discussed that instead of wandering around houses showing obvioulsy staged, cluttered rooms and then just removing the clutter. Not a big help."
2,"HD version- Same great movie, mediocre transfer","If you're needing the blu-ray version just because you're a completist, then this is for you; but if you're looking for a well transferred HD version of this classic...keep waiting.Thought it's better than the DVD, the film grain and compression of the HD transfer are in conflict throughout the film. There are fantastically restored blu-ray films (IE Casablanca) that unfortunately don't or can't receive the same treatment. It's a shame that after countless reissues the MGM can't pony up restoration money for this HD reissue."
5,Great suspense thriller,If you like thrillers this movie is great. It seems a little dated now but the acting and characters are rich and the plot is interesting.
4,"Creepy and Disturbing (movie 5 stars, dvd 4 stars)","A very well-crafted thriller classic from John Frankenheimer (""Ronin""). Creepy and disturbing. It's not the kind of movie you sort of sit back and just watch waiting to be entertained, considering this movie takes somewhat a more darker look at espionage, brain-washing, assassinations, and politics. Considering there are also no distinguishable cookie-cutter bad guys add to the foreboding darkness of the situation. Well-written, good acting from all the cast, fine work from Frank Sinatra and Angela Lansbury, and I found the dream-sequence particularly clever. As for the DVD, it is fairly okay, but nothing particularly new in terms of extras. The sound quality is good, but might've been improved a bit."
5,This is the one!,"Don't bother with the Denzel version - this is the one! You will really enjoy this one, and bits of it still ring true today!"
2,How not to make a DVD,"This DVD is an example of how one should NOT be done. The video quality is on the level of VHS, or even worse, something taped straight off the air with a bad antenna. The menu is very simplistic and the whole disc seems to have been rushed out in order to cash in on the millenium memorabilla craze. I would have expected better from CNN, being the ""world news leader"". The footage could have been remastered and cleaned up and more time could have been spent polishing it. Buy this disk if you absolutely have to own a record of the Y2K New Year's celebrations."
1,horrible dvd,this is the worst dvd i have ever seen. save ur money. they show 1 second of footage for each city and sound is horrible along with resolution. does anyone know where i can get the abc 2000 version of the millenium on tape or dvd? if so e-mail me.
1,Huge Dissapointment!,"I was expecting all cities to be shown...not just the few that they did. Where was Boston, Toronto, etc... Then they split DC and NYC! Just awful. The graphics covered too much of the screen of what they did show, and we could live without the CNN logo in the corner! Hope somebody else does it right!"
3,"Plenty of power & features, too much hum,","Still playing around with my settings. Am pleased with the power output and it easily drives my 12"" sub-woofer. However, very distinctive low-end hum from this amp is annoying."
1,definitely wont buy again,"I bought this stuff in hopes that it would give me great curls that would last throughout the day..it doesn't last 2 hours. I have thick wavy hair that really isn't that difficult to work with. But I get and keep more curls just from scrunching it while it's wet (with no product) than I do when I use this stuff. It just weighs my hair down and gives it a greasy look. It just turns into a watery oil type substance in your hand too. I would definitely not recommend this product for anyone, regardless of your hair type."
2,Got2b curling mouse did not really help my curls,"* Got2b curling mouse did not really help my curls* At first my curls looked good when I first applied, but after 15 to 20 min my curls were gone* Wish I got to try the original version"
4,Good overview of ethics for DSST / Dantes,This is a good book to read to prepare for the DSST Ethics exam.
3,It was maHIV,"The awakening of love in Livvy, the main character is the magic in this story as well as her friendship with the two girls from Camp Amache. The geography of the story was confusing to one who lived in the area for a long time."
3,Saw the movie first . . .,"I saw this movie first one night and loved the it! When I found out it was a book I quickly ran out to get it thinking that the book had to be far better than the movie as they tend to be. However, I found the book a bit of a drag. I suppose the movie took on a lot of creative license and really made the movie into an enjoyable product. I am by no means knocking the book. I did enjoy it to some degree, but I suppose it was just a let down as I was expecting a more involved version of the movie."
1,When research gets out of hand,"This was such an interesting idea, such a poor read. The author tells you, rather endlessly, about the era, but it doesn't feel like lived experience for any of the characters. Neither is, sadly, the main story line of the heroine coming to appreciate and fall in love with her husband. This was totally unconvincing to me. Lots and lots and lots of tidbits from the author's no-doubt fascinating research are plunked down in the story, where they sit like undigested bits of beef or underdone potato, totally unrelated to the story as a whole. I was disappointed to see the Penguin imprimatur on this one."
3,Not Believable,"Olivia Dunne, reeling from her mother's death during World War II in Denver, Colorado, takes rash and hasty actions with a soldier and finds herself pregnant. When's Livvy's minister father finds out, he ships her off to an arranged marriage to a bean farmer, Ray Singleton. Ray is a quiet, lonely man who loves Livvy almost immediately, for reasons the reader cannot fathom. Livvy is diffident and stand-offish, out of touch with her feelings, but eventually falls for Ray, also for inexplicable reasons. The dialogue is stilted and strained, so it is hard to suspend disbelief with this improbable romance. The author instead spends much of the novel's time on the improbable sub-plot of Livvy's friendship and eventual betrayal by two Nisei sisters from the nearby Japanese internment camp. I forced myself to finish this and would not go out of my way for any more of this author's works."
5,Loved every bit of just having church. mb.,Must have more uplifting music. It keeps a smile on your face . Enjoy most music but this tops it all. I am older so I am biased. THIS music has helped to keep a people steady for years under difficult times and will again. mb
5,Great starter set.,"I purchased this set many years ago just to have some music on while studying. Because it only presents excerpts from larger pieces, I often ended up tracking down the full album my favorite pieces came from. (Which only led to more albums, and here I am today something of a classical music nerd.) Many of the albums the excepts are pulled from are on one of Sony's budget labels, too.I appreciate that this set presents such a large spectrum of recordings, from the earliest to nearly the latest, from Gould and Glass to Williams film scores and some opera. The booklets that accompany this set are nicely done too. The only downside to the set is its limitation to Columbia/CBS/Sony recordings."
4,Just what my daughter wished for,"We have been quite happy with this bike. Wife put it together easily and daughter has been enjoying it for the last month. Training wheels needed some tightening after the first couple of days, but the bike is well constructed and will work for many more years."
4,Well wrote,"I am new to Louis De Bernieres. I've read only two of his books, but recommend his work strongly. The characters seem real and the writing is well done - plain in a good way.The overall impression for me is one of honest writing, which could almost have been depressing or preachy, except for the strength of the characters, and yes it is a funny book."
2,"A 40-minute zombie tour...oh, boy...","Zombie Revenge will certainly please a certain type of gamer, the type that just wants to sit down and go. But those looking for depth or great rewards will be disappointed by Revenge's lack of anything substantial over a one-week period. True, the graphics are pretty good, mimicking the arcade game of the same name, and some of the bosses, particularly the large Zombie hanging over the side of the building and trying to crush you with his hands, are creepy as heck. But the gameplay is off, not offering enough variety or tricks to keep you playing, and the two-player mode is dullsville. I suppose if you need a quick fix and you're too lazy to pull out the light guns for House of the Dead 2, Zombie Revenge should suit you, but others should go with a rental, you'll probably get the same out of the game as the buyers do."
2,not bad game,"If you like Resident evil titles, you will like this game but this isn't that good DC game. I don't think this is good graphic game. It's just decent game for DC or Arcade. anyway.. overall is pretty good game but if you have chance to rent this game, you should do that first."
3,An Ok game,"This game was cool, the vmu mini game was fun but it got old really fast. It seemed to me to be a little to easy after a while. You can only beat a game so many times until it becomes repetitious. The other options in the game while being inventive, where not much fun. The crude version of a fighting game was very weak. But i played the arcade version also, and this game is a direct translation which is very cool. But after a while it became very boring."
1,Beethoven,"I thought I was ordering a factual history of Beethoven, not a detailed epistle on his music. I was extrememly disappointed. I would think only a professional classical trained musician would enjoy this book."
2,Are you a musicologist?,"I am a longtime fan of Beethoven- the greatest artist yet born, but like most I don't know enough about the man and his life.This book begins with, and is thoroughly bogged-down by philosophical wanderings so far away from Beethoven himself that I often wondered what the author's intent was. I think I finally found out: to impress us with his knowledge of the arcane workings of musical form.I would like a good biography of Beethoven, Please.Do not buy this book."
2,"OK, but not worth multiple plays","As a big fan of Broadway Vocals-type albums, I eagerly looked forward to this offering from LML Music. While I appreciated the quality of both Mr. Chandler's and Ms. Benton's voices, and the creativity in many of their choices, overall the album strikes one chord and stays there. I did enjoy Hey There and Going Home, but after many songs I kept wanting to say, ""OK, we KNOW you two are in love, already."" I'd prefer love songs that help me celebrate my own love, not theirs exclusively."
3,"Earth does not shake, but very pretty and a nice gift","Nothing wrong with this, and makes an excellent gift for those people on your list who can't quite get into current pop stuff, but wouldn't enjoy actual opera. Buy this, Andrea Bocelli, and Charlotte Church and you've got yourself some very pretty dinner music. (And good for him, I say -- nobody's playing MY singing at dinnertime, that's for sure!)"
5,This will change the way you define your musical tastes.,"Just as only music can elevate words to their true emotional potential, Josh Groban's voice is able to bring ears of all kinds the ultimate enjoyment of music. I'm a lover of classical and operatic music, among other styles, but I've passed my Josh Groban CD all around my office (when I can bear to part with it!) - to metal heads, country bumpkins, jazz nuts, and hip hoppers - and it has been met every time with awe and the speedy purchase of another copy. I believe Josh's voice has the power to make the parameters of popular music stretch wide to encompass a unique style that transcends genre. It should be required listening for all living humans. And their pets."
5,I have hope in young people again!,"Josh Groban's voice and music restore my hope in the younger generation. He has a beautiful, well-trained voice, and he sings songs that mean something--that soothe the soul.I am so tired of listening to canned, modern music where the guitars are so distorted you can't discern music, where the singer yells the lyrics rather than sings them. Josh has obviously gone to the trouble and time to really learn to sing--to use his voice as an instrument.I appreciate the Italian lyrics in many of his pieces, having lived in Italy for a number of years.Great work, Josh!"
1,Mr. Pat Boone?,"Let's see... ""deep"" voice, same delivery of every sappy song, good looks (if you don't mind the hair)... Is it Pat Boone? No, it's Josh Groban. No doubt that with some technology to assist his voice (sadly unavailable for poor Pat in his day) the housewives will be in love. With my handy crystal ball I see a Christmas Special coming some time this season. If I turn out to be wrong about it, I will take the unltimate punishment - listen to this again."
1,You are kidding???,"You liked this?Some time in the future, the term ""Josh Groban"" will undoubtedly become a euphamism for mindless pap.ie: ""What the hell is that on the radio, boyo? It sounds like muzak from the elevator to hell?"" ""Oh dad, it's just some Josh Groban-style stuff, I'll turn it off.""This album is quite honestly one of the most appalling examples of trite rubbish produced for people who think Mills and Boon novels are literature.For the love of all things holy, don't subject yourself to it."
3,Overproduced,"Why? Destroy a talent?The voice is good, the songs are good.But the production [isn't very good]. If you got a high endhifi, you here the echoeffects all the time.Let the voice speak for it self!"
2,Not a good purchase,I found this an odd CD. It had Italian operatic type songs and then pop songs. It made my wonder who Josh Grobin thinks he is.
2,Not a great talent...,"He has a good ""college play, or high school play"" voice, but he'll not ever be an opera star, or a decent operetic singer. Very little magic happens here, and the cd is just typical of the commercial appeal for the every day soccer mom's who will rush to Tower Records and pick this up. This is along the same lines commercially speaking as Andrea Bucelli.Bottom line"": Don't buy this unless your a soccer Mom, who drives a big sports utulity vihicle or a mini-van, otherwise stay away from this drek."
5,OH MY JOSH,"We first saw and heard Josh on Ally McBeal, My husband and I decided we wanted to see and hear more, more. We bought our CD several months ago and listen to it in the car nearly every day. I bought a copy for my sister, now her husband is jealous of Josh. I bought copies for my massage therapist, hairdresser and best friend, I can't wait to share Josh with them as well. I also found out that Celine Dion loves Josh, too. ON MY JOSH I mean gosh, we love Josh."
4,"Beautiful talent, but a few songs lack depth...","This young man's voice is beyond beautiful...when i listen to him sing i sometimes feel like crying. Most of the songs on this CD are absolutely perfect for his voice, but a few seemed forced...like the song would have been better suited for someone with a higher range. I also am not a huge fan of the song with The Coors. While i like The Coors and Josh seperately, their voices did not mesh well together. Other than perhaps, three, songs on the CD it was extremely well done and wonderful for a debut CD."
5,HIS VOICE MAKES YOU FEEL.,A VOICE LIKE JOSH'S DOESN'T COME AROUND VERY OFTEN. HE WILL BE THE SUPERSTAR OF 2002 AND BEYOND.BRAVO JOSH!
4,Heaven on Earth,Melodies that capture your soul and touch your heart.Josh has the voice of an angel. Enjoy!
4,Not his best song selections,"Love Josh Groban's voice, but I think his song selections sometime reflect more of what he wants to sing and less about what the public would like to hear."
5,Beautiful Album,I love this album. I first heard of Josh Groban in August when a friend suggested a few of these songs be played at the service as background to a video of his life. It was perfect. It is now my favorite album and I play it several times a week.
5,Exceptional!,"What an exceptional talent! Josh has a most amazing voice and range - this CD presents both very well. From the first song to the last you cannot stop listening. I have played this CD all day at work since I got it and never tired of listening to it. Anyone who has had even the slightest introduction (like myself, via Ally McBeal) to this young man MUST HAVE this CD to enjoy for a long time to come. What an absolutely beautiful voice."
2,Disappointing...,Each song he sings is special with his voice...but this CD is disjointed and grasping. Couldn'the producers put together a cohesive CD that flowed from one song to the other? This is my first Josh CD and quite frankly I'll need to think twice before purchasing a second.
1,"""Popera"" at its blandest, from an opera singer-in-training","I've had enough of people with weak voices who think that if they sing with enough vibrato a trite pop song with an orchestral accompaniment that it entitles them to call themselves opera singers.Yes, he has a nice voice. Yes, he's attractive. Yes, he's been on Oprah and has sung with Celine Dion.The fact is, he sings all his songs without expression, without dynamic, without feeling, without power. All his songs sound the same, and he sings them in exactly the same way. In addition to his pitifully small range, there is no variety, no edge, no venture. At least Sarah Brightman had the courage to cover a Queen song now and then. He sings with neither effort nor pleasure. And his music is certainly not pleasing to my ears.If you want good music, listen to some real operatic voices, and not Josh Groban (or Charlotte Church or Andrea Bocelli, for that matter)."
5,Recommended Buy,"If you love music or even if you just like music, this CD is a must-have. It contains great songs with that perfect blending of beautiful melodies, wonderful lyrics and a great voice. This is not one of those CDs that only have 1 or 2 good songs -- you will like or love almost every song on the CD, if not EVERY song!"
5,Love The Sound of Josh Groban's Voice,"When I first heard Josh Groban sing, I was in awe. How does such a beautiful sound come from such a young person? A few years later and I am still left in awe. His debut album is a mixture of the genres. He combines the beauty of classical music with soulful ballads that make you smile, because the result is pure beauty."
3,not falling yet,"I thought this cd was okay, but I agree there could be some improvements in his depth of emotion (though his voice is great).I also really like Let me Fall, but I have always loved this song, listen to it in the original from the Cirque Du Soleil soundtrack of Quidam, its fantastic as well."
5,It's All Good!,"I bought this CD after recognizing Josh from the Charlotte Church TV special a couple of months ago where he did one amazing duet with her. His voice gives me goose bumps literally! If you like Andre' Bocelli you will LOVE Josh Groban. My five year old sleeps to this CD and brings it to school with her. It's soothing, it's romantic, it's powerul, it's perfect for a dinner party or just playing in the background while you work. I highly recommend it to anyone from any walk of life in any age group."
3,Lovely,"This is a very good CD, however, I would have enjoyed it more if Mr. Groban's voice was showcased a little more by singing songs that would challenge his vocal abilities more. I can't wait to hear the quality of Mr. Groban's voice in a few years once his voice training is completed. Andrea Boccelli could have some company at the top . . ."
4,Awesome Young Man..with a Future,"This awesome young man caught my attention on the Ally McBeal show and continues to live up to his talent in this CD. His wonderful performance with ""To Where You Are"" is chillingly beautiful.The other songs are just icing on the cake....some religious and some love ballads. A nice rendition of ""Vincent"" and all time favorite. You will enjoy his ""bocelli-like"" voice and mature sound."
5,Id' give it more than 5 if I could,"I LOVE IT! Can't get enough of this man's voice. Imagine, a man's voice that I can sing along with. He's like a female Barbara Streisand. Nothing and no one like either of them. Can't wait for more releases from him."
5,Incredible,"So here's how I discovered Josh Groban I had turned the t.v in my bedroom I saw Oprah was on I decided to make a quick run to the kitchen then I decided to go to the bathroom I was walking past my bedroom door when I heard a voice that stopped me dead in my tracks it was so beautiful I ran into my bedroom to see who was singing, it was Josh. I had always hated anything classical but after hearing Josh sing ""To where you are"" I became an instant fan. I think he has one of the most beautiful voices in the world. His voice trancends you to another place amid all the crap we hear on radio today Josh is a welcome change. It's like finding water in a desert. Keep singing Josh heaven must have known we needed you."
5,Josh Groban,"An amazing work of art! This debut album is inspirational and uplifting. I play it everyday for 8 hours a day and my patients love it, and want to know where to buy it. It is a masterpiece!"
5,outstanding,"There are not enough words to describe Josh's immense talent. His voice is unbelievably smooth, emotional, warm, and wonderful. I've never heard anything more wonderful. Every song on this CD is amazing and perfect. I am so ecstatic about this CD!!!"
5,pure heaven,"if you love grand music this man is for you...................get this cd and enjoy what i experienced first hand at sarah brightman's ""la luna"" tour.. this fine young man sang with ms. brightman and melted my heart. the music is wonderful, the performance suberb. so sit back and travel to where josh takes you to. don't miss this one..p.s.make sure sarah brightman's ""classics"" cd is on your turn table too...she's pure magic."
1,This DVD is a Joke! *Warning*,"I was stupid enough to ignore the other 1 star review and bought this DVD anyway. It is very poor quality the instructor CAN NOT teach, and its true his lip licking is VERY anoying and the audio and video is very poor quality. I've never felt the need to write a review but this DVD was so bad I just had to let people know!!"
3,Didnt get the product.,"NRG was out of stock and could not give a definate resupply date to the distributer that was selling it.That being said, the vendor did an excellent job of sending me a megan brace at the same price. Excellent customer service."
3,I wish I had bought the Garmin,"I bought this thing thinking it was well priced and would do the job. I was disappointed. I have used Garmins and find it more accurate and easier to use. If you try to put in an address this thing doesnt like it just refuses to allow you the option of putting in the numbers. Instead of identifying each street as you come to it, it identifies every other or less. I am sorry I bought in now. Will probably give it to someone else and buy the Garmin"
5,Just what I wanted!,The best I've seen and used. Easy to learn how to use it to find anything. Arrived quickly. Installed in my vehicle in seconds and down the road I went. The Magellan RoadMate 2200T is all they said it would be. You have to get one of these!
2,Slo........................w,"I bought this unit 2 weeks ago and now returned it. Reasons?1. Satellite lock takes from 5 to 10 minutes, even after latest software updates. Isn't it vaunted SirfstarIII chip set?2. It's reacts slow. Even the speed is 30mph and you missed your turn and the next possible turn is in 100 yards range it takes 1-2 sec to understand what I missed the turn, 2-3 sec to recalculate the route and no time left to tell you about next turn. So you missed the turn again and again and again.3. Some places, developed more than 2 years ago are still not on the map. I saw it in Newport, VT4. POI database is very old and limited."
3,Were the map up to date it would be a good unit,"I purchased this unit about 2 weeks ago. The unit is light, readable, audio is ok, battery life seems good. But the map is lousy. I live in Miami, the metro area is one of the biggest in the US. Yet some of the most basic roads it does not seem to have or does not have them correctly! I called Magellen and updated the software to the latest, but it does not seem to affect the maps. Magellen claims to be coming out soon with updated software to make this unit a Crossover,which will be nice. But that won't fix the map problem. Since this is the most basic feature required of a GPS I can't give it a passing mark. Luckily I can return it, and I will."
2,Missing Street,"I have found that many streets that I have tried to navigate to are not present on the system. Sub-divisions that have been around for about 2 years are not there. There was a part of an interstate that was also missing. I went to the Magellan website and submitted a support request but that went unanswered. I have a friend that paid $100 more and got a Garmin. So far he has not had a street not show up on his system. Navteq has the addresses on file, but it appears that Magellan has not put out an update. Does well with the locations that are present on the system. Not experiencing the power down problems that others have been having."
5,Like stret name on top,I researched Nav. systems for over 10 hours and found this system to be the best value for the business traveler. It's small enough to fit in my PC case and full featured. The street name (nice and big) on the top of the screen is very useful since many (minor) streets don't have street signs at the intersections. Easy to use; great value!
4,Repetitive but amusing,"I had my first taste of Crazy Taxi in an arcade and had a blast! There's nothing like being able to zip through town, pick up customers and drop them off with the incentive of accruing points and time. The Dreamcast version is true to form - everything has been duplicated on the home version with vivid colors. The controls may take a little getting used to since it is so responsive but once you get the hang of it its a breeze to get from point 'A' to point 'B' in no time.The game is repetitive - sometimes you end up taking a customer to the same place you just left. I've noticed that there may sometimes be an issue of processor speed, during some sequences, you may notice a slight lag but the recovery is quick and you're back on track in no time.Overall, an entertaining game and there's plenty of options to break up the monotony of some of the gameplay."
4,Pretty Good!,"This is a good game, but I would buy Crazy Taxi 2 now and not 1. 2 has a bunch of more features that are worth the extra $20.00 or so extra."
2,Fun but...,i think this game has some pretty awesome gameplay but itdidn't keep me playing it simply got boring finding out that thereisn't anything to do. And you can't tell your friends that you beatthe game because there never was a game-beating goal.So save your money and buy Resident Evil3 or Dead or Alive2. END
4,A must-read for R.E.M. fans,"When it was released in 1983, R.E.M.'s first album, Murmur, immediately became one of my favorites. Sounding (and looking) completely unlike anything else at the time, the songs spoke to me even when I wasn't sure exactly what Michael Stipe was singing.After reading this excellent book from the always excellent 33-1/3 series, I'm beginning to understand that maybe that was the point.The book is much more than just a lengthy 'review' of the album; it also provides insightful background on the group and an intelligent examination of theories on songwriting, performing and recording. I listen to Murmur now with an increased sense of understanding and connection. This book is highly recommended for anyone, and absolutely esssential for the R.E.M. fan."
4,Well organized and presented,"I am a VB programmer currently but programmed in C and C++ for a couple of years, years ago. I found the presenter to be well spoken and thorough. Covers each topic well.The audio is sub-standard but is ok for the content being presented. There are chapters (""Lessons"") on this DVD but there is no timecode. So if you have to stop the DVD and come back, you have to just FF and RW until you find where you were within the lesson.If you need a dynamic high energy speaker, go to a class. This guy is calm, cool and collected. Frankly I like his teaching style."
2,MEDICAL AND HEALTH ENCYCLOPEDIA,"VERY EXCELLENT REFERENCE FOR GEN. READERS, BEING THE LEADER IN THE GOVERNMENT SALES IN BOOK INDUSTRY I WANT TO BE A SOLE DISTRIBUTOR ALSO FOR THE GOVT. SALES HERE IN THE PHILIPPINES."
3,Slow Food - Fast Edit,"""Slow Food"" and the slow food movement deserve better than this. The subjects are interesting and informative, but the frequent mistakes in the words ( not typos - real serious errors) makes it embarassing and I finally gave up. Because of the too-fast or careless editing ( apparently by non-English speakers in many cases) I would not give this book as a gift to anyone I know who otherwise would be interested in the subject. Too bad."
3,"if you really care, just get the instant conversation",the first four cds of instant conversation are the exact same as the quick and simple cds.dont waste your money buying both if you really want to learn chinese
1,A disappointment,"I read a glowing review of this album so I couldn't wait to get it. What a disappointment! The song titles looked so promising but Mr. Coulter's voice is so nasal and his interpretations are so over the top that I had trouble getting through the whole disc. Sorry, but this just wasn't worth the hype that prompted me to buy it."
5,Perfect for portable MP3 players like the Rio500,"The SanDisk 32MB SmartMedia card was the largest available when I bought it last year to supplement the 64MB onboard the Rio500 MP3 player. It worked flawlessly, easily accomodating about 38 extra minutes of 160-kHz quality MP3 music data - enough to get the last couple of tracks off of 72-minute CD albums. The card is about an inch square and really ""wafer-thin."" (less than 1mm thick)Bear in mind that since that time, a 64MB card has become available, and it will work flawlessly in the Rio500; larger MB cards are promised and should be compatible as well.If you also use a Compact Flash digital camera, it's worth considering a cardreader/writer such as the Viking Intelliflash (also available from Amazon.) With this you can easily read and write data from both card formats, SmartMedia and CompactFlash."
5,BUY THIS TOO!,"Hey, Stay CD2 contains a live B-Side of Stephen in the Boyzone era, singing a nice song, Games Of Love (originally from the 'A Different Beat' album) and an interesting feature: Earlier this year he asked us, fans, to send him questions via his website and Brit group Hear'Say interviewed him with 20 of those questions... how is that related to this CD? The enhanced section of Stay CD2 is the interview! Loads of fun! Oh, and it is a really limited edition, in many places over UK it's already gone, so grab yours!"
5,Better than what you get at the local hardware store,"Very nice consistency, easy to apply, easy clean-up and looks great. I'm an amateur, but I purchased this because it's what the plumbing company used when they worked on a sink. Costs more than the brands in the local store, plus shipping, but it's worth it (for now; I can't vouch for the 20-year claim at this point). I didn't know how to judge how much I'd need, now I wish I'd bought 2 tubes as I like it so much, I'm re-doing other areas in the house."
2,Knife tip cracked,"The set has a pleasant visual appearance. I've owned it for over a year and it does a fair job. Chef knif use to go blunt quite often. And unfortunately, the tip of the 8"" chef knife cracked and left me with dissapointment. I wouldn't buy this product again."
3,Better than its predecessors but just plain OK,"I was quite disappointed with the setup menu screens. It's kind of hard to maneuver through. Game play is not as smooth as it should be. Goal scoring and play seemed realistic, but it was hard to score at times. Worth playing but maybe for a little less."
3,"Excellent in fine details, but lacking some key big ones","Well it looks stunning enough. The game play is smooth, all the little details are there. But I noticed that it was difficult to tell when I'd scored a goal. The announcer guy just kept talking about some player or something instead of immediatly saying goal! and there's no siren, when you score! To sum up. It has the looks to pull you in, but it lacks the fun to keep you there."
1,Don't Buy This Game,"I just rented this game, the graphic's or pretty good, but the gameplay is not good, and the controlls aren't good. If you want to buy a great hockey game buy NHL 2000 for Playstation."
4,Wasted potential. The game was obviously rushed.,"Lemme just say that the gameplay is great. I think the games are extremely fun, especially against another player. Scoring is kinda hard but not that bad. Graphics, of course, are state of the art. The options are severly limited. It differs a lot from NBA2K and NFL2K. No practice mode or anything. Season mode is a joke. But I'd still recomend it despite it not living up to Sega Sports potential. Next years game will be light years better."
4,Interesting atmosphere,"This was my first Domenic Stansberry book. Being from the San Francisco Bay area, I thought he deftly captured the essence of the street life and the old italian neigborhoods. Loads of authentic atmosphere! The story moved quickly, and I read it in a few long sittings, unable to put it down. I'll probably read more of his work, but he's worth giving a try.IMHOJ.Jenkins"
4,Cosmological Theory simplified,"Thanks to Dr. Guth for trying to explain the Cosmology, Theory of Inflation in simple terms. Of course it sounds simple, after all there is a whole theory behind it and this book is written in paperback without any single formula. It is a good book for popular scientist, with this book you learn a littel more about the cosmological theories which Inflation is one of them. Due to the difficulty of the subject the teacher had to go into concepts that sound simple judging from the name but extremely diffcult to comprehend.If you know about the subject and most importanatly the tools of the trade, you understand better each sentence otherwise you just get the flare of it. The book is the only as far as I know in this field written at this level as a story and especially by one of the founders of the theory, reminds me the book Hawkigns Universe, simplified very difficult concepts."
2,We love Tot-Locks - but this item is pricey!,"We think that the tot-lok is a great system. Easy to install and secure. Our toddler has figure out how to open some other kinds of lock but not this one.Although I like the tot-lok system and recommend it, I have to give this particular item a lower rating. I would have rated it higher but I think they are charging a lot for a plastic coated magnet. It works, it's just not a good value. For a couple of bucks more I'd suggest getting the tot-lok starter kit, which include several locks, plus this magnet key. If you've lost your key or want a spare, you may want to consider buying a cheap, strong, magnet for a couple of bucks. It will work just as well. How do I know? That's what we did instead of buying this."
