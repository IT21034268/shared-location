5,really does the trick,really like the unit. i would recommend to another person for sure. It hasd helped me out alot and my wife really likes it.
2,ball had a hole in the center and wasn't in the description or shown,"The description of the ball was a ""solid"" ball. The ball had a hole through the center and this wasn't in the description nor a picture. The picture showed a ""solid"" ball. Was mislead............I have a couple ""kong"" ball without the hole. They are solid and that was what I was wanting to purchase. I knew ""Kong"" was going to the hole in the center and I thought I could trust Amazon and the seller to purchase more ""solid"" balls. I was very mislead in this purchase. Very unsatisfied because my husband and I needed the ""solid"" ball for our ACD, because she is a very aggressive chewer."
2,Not Great.,"These colored pencils are not erasable, which was disappointing because that is why I bought them . The lead falls out easily calling their quality into question.If you want to be able to erase, do not buy these."
5,THE BEST,"Clay Aiken's voice is so beautiful and charming on this Christmas DVD. I can't get enough of Clay Aiken's heartwarming renditions of these Christmas songs. Clay Aiken entertains me and excites with his wonderful persona, charisma, and of course, his unique, powerful VOICE!!! This Christmas DVD is a must-have!!!"
2,didn't even need it,stock antenna plug for my 2001 Nissan Altima worked great WITHOUT THIS. Didn't even need it! waste of $5.00
3,Armstrong has written better...,"I decided to read this book because I've read a few other books she has written (notably: Holy War). She has a wonderful way of writing about history and I was hoping this one would also be a good read. I was somewhat disappointed and found this book a bit boring... she examines the history of fundamentalism in the three monotheistic faiths. She proposes that religion fulfils the role of ""mythos"" in our daily lives, and science fulfils the role of ""logos"". Both have to be present for mankind to feel a sense of purpose and to progress. It would be a good read for someone who is having a hard time understanding why religion is still playing a role in politics. As a muslim, this book gave me a good understanding of jewish and christian fundamentalist concerns. If you're really interested about understanding religious fundamentalits, this book would be what you're looking for."
3,Strong thesis,"I like history that is presented with a good strong thesis. Armstrong's book is just that. That strength is also a weakness when the author stretches too far to draw all the examples into that thesis.The sections on Islam and Judaism are well developed and thorough. The section on protestantism is rather weak. Linking Jerry Falwell together with Timothy McVeigh would require a lot more development. This section seems almost ""wedged in"" to create a sense of ""completeness"" by covering all three of the great monotheistic faiths.The categorization of human knowledge into two categories MYTHOS and LOGOS is interesting. However, this observation seems to be thrown in without being well explained. I think it skirts around some long debated issues of epistimology such as the role of reason and logic and that of revelation.I listened to the book on tape as read by the author. I consider it a well done presentation of the material in audio format."
1,wrong wax,"the pot is nice, but i specifically bought this kit because i wanted the hard wax... which it says it comes with... they sent me the ""original"" wax, which i can't even use because of skin sensitivity... really annoyed"
1,young Bing & older Rosemary,My husband & I were disappointed. We lovc Bing Crosby & Rosemary Clooney singing but they don't sing together in any songs & the sound quality isn't that good either.
1,Don't bother to buy this,"Our family bought this several years ago and I was so disappointed with it. We threw it away, it was so bad. As another reviewer pointed out, there are no duets on this, and the end result is a disconnected, unsatisfying trip down memory lane. The only place the two are together is on the CD cover. If you are hoping to recapture at least some of Crosby and Clooney's collaborative magic from their ""White Christmas"" movie days, forget about it. You are better off just buying CDs dedicated to the individual artists. There's a reason why this CD sells so cheaply, both used and new."
4,Story of Home,"Although I am a bit younger than the main character in the book, I grew up in the mountains of North Carolina and experienced a bit of the same climate. I have traveled the world, spent most of my life in academia,and have now at the age of 66 returned to the area where I was reared and am serving as a licensed local pastor. Some of the stories seem a bit out there for a 5th generation mountain man but in total the book is refreshing and sad at the same time. I highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to learn something of the basic core of the mountain folks who have lived in the Blue Ridge Mountains for more than a season."
4,"""The Man Who Moved a Mountian"" Also Moves Your Heart","I stumbled across this book years ago in a library aboard the Mercy Ship Anastasis. It was dusty, and the pages worn, but the true story inside is invigorating. Bob Childress lived in a time and place where things were hard, and there was little hope. To those living in the Appalachians in those days, there was futility and death found in the petty feuds, and in the alcohol produced in the backwood stills. Bob accomplished the impossible for neighbors and communities a hundred miles around. His life was an example of Christian love that this world longs for, and it moved mountains. Childress was a simple man with a simple message whose actions reflected a strength beyond himself. His home-spun book is an inspiration conquering problems many face even today."
3,A Spirited Tale,"The author chronicles the life of a southwestern Virginian who turned from a life typical of country mountain men into one where he was able to bring hope and life to the local inhabitants.He could have chosen an easy life; instead he was caught up in a religious life, which he saw offered ways to climb out of ignorance and poverty for people caught in the bonds of a traditional society with no upward ability.I was moved by the story, myself.The copy of the original for the Kindle edition was done by a scan, I believe, and little editing was used, so the errors of the original we're directly transferred to the Kindle edition.Otherwise a gripping tale from start to finish."
5,A dose of snickering non-reality from a master storyteller.,"An undetectable edge on the rest of the world -- everyone's dream? In _The Girl, the Gold Watch and Everything_, the late Mr. MacDonald turned his mastery of plotting and characterization toward ""what-if"" fiction, and more than succeeded. Lighthearted, yet never frothy, this story gave me more grins per page than any book in a long time. Even better, after I turned the last page, I was left with my imagination in overdrive. Highly recommended to those who don't like techie sci-fi or magic fantasy, but would like a dose of snickering non-reality. Like _Back to the Future_, but much better"
5,COST ACCTG 12TH EDITION,PRODUCT IN EXCELLENT LIKE NEW CONDITION. ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY AND SELLER RESPONDED TIMELY TO MY INQUIRY.
2,Not impressed,"I am not sure whether my negative perception of this book arises more from my disliking the book or the subject matter, but I felt like I had trouble learning from it as well as I have from other textbooks. I generally rely on the text to clarify anything I missed from a professor's lecture, but this one was not that helpful for me. I'm sure this is related to the fact that I am absolutely horrible at accounting, but I was hoping that the textbook could save me and teach me whatever I was missing in class... no such luck!"
4,Sea Kings of Crete,"Well written and a good readI enjoyed the history,interplay of civilizations,and the myths that were discussed. So much of the Minoan history has changed since the discovery of the Santorini volcanic eruption. Still this book was a good starting point"
4,Oh Mia o' my!,"Every once in awhile we all stumble into an album where you hear it and you think to yourself ""why isn't this person played all over the place?!"" This is one such album. Mia Doi Todd has crafted just a bunch of great songs which frame her voice is an amazing way. It isn't beyond complex music, just music really well done with leanings of some folk, some pop and just general female singer awesomeness.Not good enough of a description? To me, she's in the vein of other strong artists such as Fiona Apple, Aimee Mann and the like. (with a less pop angle)Just a solid album to wince the night away with on a mellow eve."
1,Watch out for the SHIPPING Expense!!!,Only $0.95 but it costs about $5.00 to ship each one!! Not a deal!
1,Poor interpretation of LotR,"At first, I was very interested in this setting, but as I read more, and played it, I found it to be lacking in options. Although well written, and interesting, it has a limited shelf life, and isn't worth the high price tag, not to mention putting up with the fans who play it (avoid fan site at ALL costs!).The writers are not up to the task they set for themselves, and a true Tolkien setting deserves much better than this. I would suggest buying this discount, to get your money's worth. There is no way to tweak the low magic setting, and I found The Black Company Campaign Guide by Green Ronin to be a much better book, with more options and flexibility. Try before you buy...and if you try Black Company too, I think you'll find it the better product."
5,A Superb Masterpiece,"This album fully showcases the genius guitarist/singer/songwrighter that is Joe Walsh. The whole album flows very smoothly. Exceptional tracks include Funk #49 and my personal favorite Tend My Garden. If you are thinking of buying this album, it is definitely a must have."
5,Bright white,Nice size for mailing large manuscripts. The self sealing feature is something I didn't look for but very happy I got it.
3,SOUNDSTREAMS CRITIQUES THE DREAM,"IT SOUNDED PRETTY WITH ATMOSPHERIC SOUNDS IN THE BACKDROP TO CREATE EUPHORIC PICTURES WHEN EYES ARE CLOSED THE SINGER A LADY HAS A LOVELY VOICE BUT,IT HINDERS THE MUSIC A LITTLE,SOME OF TANGERINE DREAMS BEST MUSIC,JUST MY OPPINION HAS LITTLE OR NO SINGING, THE SOUNDTRACK TO ""LEGENDS""IS A EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE WITH JON ANDERSON OF YES MAKING A SWEET PRESENTATION,SOME OF THE SONG REMINDED ME OF KATE BUSH'S LYRICs & VOICING,BOTH SINGERS HAVE THAT CELTIC FEEL THAT WORKS NICELY WITH WORKS OF TANGERINE DREAM,THE C/D PHAEDRA WAS MADE TO TEST YOUR SURROUND SOUND SPEAKERS,THAT IS MY FAVORITE,""LEGENDS"" A CLOSE 2nd.I WISH TANGERINE DREAM WOULD FIND THERE WAY TO SANTA ROSA,CALIFORNIA AND PLAY FOR US PEACE THRU MUSIC ~ SMITHYBEAT"
2,A new Tangerine Dream album?! Nope...not what you think....,"Vocals + TD - Everything that makes TD good = a marginal album.Not a terrible album if you are a Tangerine Dream purist, but a very mediocre one at best."
4,Webster's World of Violence,"The drama of John Webster is characterized by themes of revenge, misanthropy, misogyny, villainy, murder and ultimately violence. Webster's play, The White Devil parallels a modern day soap opera in which the plot keeps readers on their edge with its numerous twists and sub-plots.I had doubts about reading Jacobean Drama, but once I picked up The White Devil, I was hooked. I was especially intrigued with the duality of the heroine Vittoria. In Vittoria, Webster offers us a character we love to hate, but finds ourselves pitying her, perhaps even siding with her.The White Devil is certainly a play worth reading."
5,SUPERHEROES!!!!,"I LOVE ACTION MOVIES!!!!! I give X-Men 3 5 out of 5 because I love action and I love super heroes! I thought it was a reasonable and fantastic ending for the X-Men series through the films. This is, above all, one of my favorite movies. I can't decide who I like better: Captain Jean-Luc Picard or Professor Charles Xavier?"
3,Is this the European version with the extras on the 2nd disc not released in uSA,"i see the 2nd disc is supposed to be a digital copy but, i wanna know if this is the 2nd disc that had all the extras only on versions outside of USA and Canada."
3,"Some Hot, Some Not","While the effects and cinematography was very good, I thought to much of the story line was put into this movie. I know some people were offended that characters appear out of sequence and such, but this is Hollywood after all, so that was less a bother to me.I think Kelsey Grammar did an awesome job with the voice of Beast and that the animation/effects guys maxed him out. I was disappointed to see Collosus be relegated to such a insignificant role. Oh well!Overall, good; but not as good as the first two!"
3,Decent Movie,"I think it just sucks because they now have to to prequels to the series. I guess it's just a product of greed. They had to do a third one, because the first two were popular. But they have problems getting all the actors to sign in on it, so it ends up being a blood sport where they kill off more than half the mutants. I thought it was pretty good, save the fact that now they're only doing movies that will feature single mutants. I guess it's easier to do those types of movies, with less ""big name"" actors, so they wont have to go through the trouble of trying to replace certain people. Even though there are a lot of actors out there that could do just as good of a job, if not better."
3,xmen,"what a great lineup, all the great actors all rolled up into one magical mutant film. ive watched every xmen because its xmen, but it doesntmean i enjoyed them. i feel that every comic story made to film should be based on its original story. i dont understand what right any directorhas changing the story around? i felt that there were too many mutants to deal with by their hands, that each character seemed on the dull andtacky side, each time."
4,What's the big departure?,"People were warning that Brett Ratner's involvement in the series would send the entire Marvel universe down the drain. Personally, I found about as much to enjoy in the third installment as I did in the Bryan Singer-helmed first two. Sure, there was a palpable focus on two characters, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), but they're probably the two most interesting characters! Shocker! I certainly hope they don't end the series with three films - I am not a big X-Men fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed all three - great special effects, interesting plotlines, and memorable characters. Put those things together and you get a great popcorn flick, albeit with enough drama and character development to keep the non-fanboys interested."
4,Only Brian Singer could make this better,I loved this movie. It went a little out there at points but it was a fitting ending to the trilogy. I wish Brian Singer had done this but all and all Brett Ratner wasn't that bad. I cant wait to see the bonus features and alternate ending.
3,Entertaining but not the best of the series,"The main storyline focuses on Dr. Jean Gray, and her transformation into the Dark Phoenix which is quite interesting. Kelsey Grammer also appears as Dr. Hank McCoy, the Beast! I always loved this character from the vintage years of X-Men and Grammer is perfect casting. Beast and the Dark Phoenix make this one worth your time, but don't expect too much -- The Final Stand is just not quite as dramatically satisfying as the first 2 films in the series. This one is a fairly conventional allegory about tolerance with some excellent sci-fi elements and good performances from Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Halley Berry as Storm."
3,"X-Men III - The ""Can't Stand It"" Edition","All-in-all, pretty much a waste of money. Completely lacking in humanity/mutant-anity, just another excuse for over-the-top special effects (which aren't too bad). The killin-off of primary characters led to great disappointment and the new characters that were introduced left me cold. Looks like this will be the last of the series."
4,(:D)....(:D)....(;D),"....love it and i hope you will too..The audience broke out in applause at least 10 times, though i must say X Men 3 the Last Stand does not follow any of the original storyline BY Marvel, but for those who are not the die hard fans it won't make a difference but hey I TAKE WHAT I CAN GET FROM THE MOVIE...I was so happy that they finally gave Ms. Berry something to do for a change even though there was no nightcrawler. The movie was great. The visuals were phenominalP.S: wait until the very end after the credits have rolled. There is a tiny scene that you must see"
1,Low value product (not a movie review),"Rather than review the movie, which I like quite a bit, I'm reviewing the Collector's Edition package. All the CE includes is a slip box case and a mini-comic book compilation. In the compilation, only one is new, the remainder being old stories. The CE package also includes the standard widescreen package, clamshell case and all. It is EXACTLY the same.Why exactly does one pay for the extra junk? I did because I didn't read the description carefully enough. You shouldn't. Get the standard WS version and save $10. The movie is the same and so is the transfer. Great movie by the way."
2,Way to kill the franchise,"I'll be quick and to the point-1. What could have been one of the best of the bunch had they considered sticking even close to the origonal story gets almost entirely re-written and turned into one long movie promo clip.2. Halle Berry beefed about not getting enough lines\screen time so they completely changed her character around. Wolverine is popular, so he also gets loads of screen time. Except for Ian, the rest of the cast pretty much could have been CGI.3. SPOILER- The kill off Cyclops and Prof. X (sort of) and leave Phoenix alive. What could have kept life in the X-Men movie series has been pretty much deep-sixed. You know Berry will not be back for another one; so why pander to her demands on this one and mess with the story? You know wolverine is popular; just do a spin-off movie and keep this series moving.I remember the X-Men from the glory days, and this pretty much killed it for me. I will buy my copy in the $5 bin at my local videostore."
3,It's OK...,"...but it's definitely the weakest of the trilogy. It seems more like a showpiece for the various mutants' powers instead of a somewhat compelling story that was present in the first 2 movies. That said, it's still alot better than most of the other recent superhero movies (that focus largely on 10 year olds with superpowers), but when an X-Men movie is considered to be of equal caliber as The Fantatastic Four (which is a decent action movie with as little story to get in the way as possible), you know you should probably reconsider purchasing said movie without watching it first..."
3,Good ... Not Great,"Excellent special effects, of course. And yet, where's the excitement?Hollywood writers/ directors need to stop pretending all sci-fi andfantasy films need to be formated for the intellect of a 10 year old.Worth seeing, but don't get excited about seeing this Last Stand ... thewriters may have felt inspired but somehow the studio managed to kill that emotion ... maybe it's just too much to inspire kids, lot's of action is better, eh? For good action, excitement and a thought provoking plot, try the movie Equalibrium ... even the title get's youthinking."
5,GREAT FUN!,This is one of those films that is a geat fantasy and very entertaining. Bought this for my son for Christmas - but became quite absorbed in the story and found it quite entertaining! Buy it!
4,"X-Men Last Stand, Outstanding!",The movie was great! Really kept the action going and is definitely a keeper. Could be the best of the trilogy but that is hard to say because I liked the other two so much!
4,"Of the three, the best","Me and all my friends agree, best one yet. After the action packed message of equality and battle against genocide, you are left excited. My friends hope for yet another sequel, but I have heard the actors conclude the trillogy complete, their contractual obligations complete.I grew up reading comics. Out of all the comic books they have made movies out of, the X-Men holds the most immaginitive, story rich environment for me. Maybe Batman holds a close second. My only critisism would be that developing all the characters in a two hour movie can not be easily done. How do you do justice to the decades of character development covered in the comic book, and complete a story line? Dispite that, they have done a great job in this movie."
2,Yawn,"Watch 1 or 2, don't waste your time. No backstories to speak of on new character, or what happened to some missing. Doubt it's the final."
4,"Good Effects, Coud Have Had A Better Story","This is a very entertaining movie, however a lot more work could have been done with the story. I gave the movie 3 stars based simply on the special effects, and 1 star for the story. If you haven't seen the movie, this is definitely a good watch."
1,Huge Disappointment,"I went on the first day to see another good installment in the X-Men Series. All i saw was a bigger budget and more action. The story makes no sense, plot holes everywhere, many main characters are killed of or lost their powers for no apparent reason. Rent this at the MOST, and the ending after the credits still didn't make it good. This is almost as bad as Pirates of the Carribean 2."
4,Please Paramount: Give us Extras ! ! !,"This sly little film, with all of its cunning little tricksneeds at least a commentary track from someone! If these actors never achieved anything in their brief careers, at least they have this film to put on their resumes. Fred Walton and writer Danilo Bach lead the the viewer on a standard 80's slasher-fest, then pull the rug out from under everything we've just seen. April Fool's indeed. Come on Paramount, I still have hope for you even after all of your bad DVD releases, with so few extras. Please do your best this time."
3,April Fool's Day (1986),"A suprise delight of a horror/mystery film, ""April Fool's Day"" is an enjoyable slasher romp that has some suspenseful scenes and a good cast. Muffy St. John (played by Deborah Foreman) invites a large group of college students to her mansion for a weekend party. Many of the students are surprised and suspicious about the invitation, for they do not like Muffy and do not understand such a selfless deed. Fun and games (which mainly consists of reading poetry and playing practical jokes) turns to terror when a killer prowls the mansion and starts knocking off the teens one by one.Director Fred Walton uses a funny, yet haunting script to create a slasher film with a twist. Nothing too special, for it stills holds very true with the genre, ""April Fool's Day"" will greatly satisfy fans of a film that combines humor and violence, while others purely dedicated to the slice-and-dice theme might be turned off. All in all, this is a film for those who enjoy horror sprinkled with laughs."
3,Cool 80s Teen Flick,I liked this movie simply because I love Deborah Foreman...she's been in some real crap but this is one of her better flicks (Valley Girl is the other flick really worth seeing). AFD really captured the spirit of the BIG EIGHTIES and if you have yet to see the movie and you were a teen back then SEE IT (and watch Porky's while you're at it)!!!
4,"Great fun, hard to actually figure out who's the killer!","I saw this movie when it came out in '86 and it kept me guessing. Total 80's movie, but its a good laugh and you really don't know who's ""in"" on what's going on...if anyone one is. The last scene made me jump sky high. Not the calibur of ""The Shining"", but still a favorite."
2,I'm The Fool,"I didn't care much for this movie. I'll try not to give anything away. Below average acting as well as special effects. The movie itself had a couple of good moments, but the ending kind of tainted everything. A clever ending doesn't translate to a good ending, I felt like I wasted my time."
1,DOES NOT FEATURE CAROLINE MUNRO,For anybody considering purchasing this DVD because it allegedly features Caroline Munro - be advised - it does not !!! This title is possibly being confused with Slaughter High - which DOES feature Caroline Munro. Unfortunately Slaughter High is not yet released on DVD.
3,"Future concept doesn't have future, TERMINATOR is the movie","I always like to watch Arnold because from the old days of Conan to this movie has been a long journey but sincerily I think that this movie remains half between a serious futuristic movie and collapse the other half in an action movie but: this is not Terminator! In Terminator the posibilities of a bad use of a technology remains always like a threat, in The 6th Day you can allways think: how convenient to have two Arnolds. At the end is a big collage of spots of the near future in some manner false but with some good action that excuse you of not to think about the moral of cloning."
2,Missing Something?,"Sitting through this movie I felt like I was watching another Total Recall. I also felt like something major was going to happen and it never did. The action is pretty good, but the story is O.K. If you like Schwarzenegger you will probably like this movie. If you don't like Schwarzenegger, then you probably hate this movie. I recommend watching Total Recall again, unless there is nothing else to rent."
3,Great for the whole family!,"If you listen to most, they will tell you that it the action movie of the year. I beg to differ! This movie displays the typical shoot'em up movies that Arnold has always done. It would probably be too much of a challenge for Arnold to play a serious role without having to make such antique remarks such as, ""I'll be back!""On a better note, if you have a preteen that lusts for some good clean action, this is the movie that will have most the kids in the family talking for days afterwards. Very futuristic, not to mention that Chevy probably got a few good digs in on the Chevy 1500 Silverado with ""auto-pilot!"" Sit back and enjoy!"
1,Arnold far too old...,"... to do this kind of stuff anymore. The story was intriguing, but no amount of panstick could hide the fact that the steroids had finally run out.It has to be said, however, that no matter how miscast Arnold was in this movie, he did a better job than his lousy efforts to be a Governor..."
5,COOL,"I know cloning humans stupid but this film is awesome. Arnold once again delivers a good action movie. He is Adam, a man who was cloned by mistake when a company thought he was someone else. Now the company who cloned him must kill him to hide the evidence. This movie is awesome, filled with gun battles, car chases, and intense helicpter scenes. It's great!"
5,The 6th Day,"THE 6TH DAY is science-fiction action film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arnold plays Adam Gibson, a professional helicopter pilot who has a loving wife and a daughter. The time period is ""the near future,"" and there are laws that ban the concept of cloning human beings, but the cloning of animals and household pets is perfectly legal. The action and the fun begins when Adam Gibson comes home from a seemingly normal day of work on his birthday, and see's a clone of himself eating his birthday cake with his wife and daughter in his house. It seems that an evil corporation has illegally cloned Adam for reasons unknow to him, but Adam is very eager to find out, so he arms himself with some weapons and goes out to kick some human-cloning .... This movie turned out to be way better than I expected, and I recommend it to all action and Arnold Schwarzenegger movie fans!"
4,A must for DVD owners!!,The 6th day is a good movie. The Acting is typical for the Genre(Big tough guy with emotions about his family)but the special effects in this one raise the level a little for future action movies. 6th day managed to pull off some simply stunning effects. If you are an Arnold fan (and if you are reading this review you most likely are!) then this is a must have on DVD. Not only do you get to see the movie but you get an inside look at how they made the special effects. I won't go as far as to say Arnold is back but he's definitely on the way!
1,Bad Idea,"Were are the old Arnold's movies like Commando, Predator, and Running Man? This one was annoying. I did not like the story, and I did not like the action. No humor at all. Special effects alone are nothing. What I particularly like is Arnold's humor. Red Heat is a perfect example of what I am talking about. While watching this movie I did not even smile. It left me with a bad feelings. Now, I am going to watch Commando to get my feelings back."
2,On his way out...,"The later films schwarzenneger made towards the end of his acting career prior to becoming Governor of California werent too bad, I mean they were no Terminator or Predator, but they were watchable. The 6th day had some great effects and action and some kind of moral story about the dangers of human cloning in the future, but again pretty mediocre. As i've said before in prior Arnold movie reviews if you're a Schwarzenneger fan as i am and want to complete your Arnold collection, get it, if not you can do better for your money....or worse, lol."
2,6th day,"The people reviewing before me seem to have reviewed the quality of the DVD instead of the movie, which probably tells you the best part about it. The plot has more holes than a swiss cheese, the dialogue seems to have come from other (boring) movies we've all seen before and Arnold is far from at his best. His age is showing, the moves are gone, and we're just left with his acting ability - which says it all. The only remotely interesting character is the bad guy, played by Tony Goldwyn. When he's not on screen you might as well go for that snack or hit the bathroom."
1,Phew,"One hardly knows whether laugh or weep. This ""thing"" is so terrible on every level that I can hardly formulate a comment. But I'll try. Horrible script, horrible casting, horrible direction, horrible production, shall I go on? Arnold looks like a vain 70 year old lady...thanks for going in to the political arena where people appreciate tasteless behavior, the fakery and falseness of material infused semi-conscious self indulgence and prositutionary greed based decision making....Robert D......shame on you! Any of you who think this awful ""product"" has any redeeming qualities whatsoever, should drop their remote and seek help before it's too late. Thanks for your indulgence."
1,not this time,"Ill be back, the famous words of one Arnold Schwarzenegger and he certainly didnt help with this film. Not only was Schwarzenegger his usual bad acting self but he decided once again to act in a bad film, with a bad plot, a worse screen play and pure direction. I couldnt wait until it was over. I believe that Arnold Schwarzenegger's career should die with a final Terminator as that was the one part he was able to play."
1,Dissapointed,The audio broke after 7 months of very kind occasional use. The only thing less reliable than this equipment was the Philips consumer relations department. I'll never purchase another Philips product again nor allow my workplace to purchase one unless they improve their warranty or reliability.
1,Rip off,"This is only 4 bulbs total. I saw another reviewer mention that but I figured that they were just mistaken. When Amazon listed the total price immediately followed by the price per PACK (not ""bulb""), it can lead you to think that this is for a 4 pack of 4 bulbs each. Shame on you Amazon. I'll take my business elsewhere, like the big box stores, where they're half the cost."
5,Puzzles and more puzzles.,This made a great gift to my husband. He loves mind challenging puzzles and this one was a very great challenge for him.
2,"woefully unreadable: in short, a mess....","Although he presents some important ideas in this too-big work, Sartre the closet Cartesian, whose systematization of existential thought make Camus and Marcel abandon the label altogether, writes so badly that even his idol Heidegger seems readable by comparison. You're better off with someone else's summary of Sartre's philosophical thought; this book isn't worth the effort."
1,Bad Faith,"Bad faith, good faith, much ado about nothing. Spent so much time thinking and writing and yet came up with such rubbish. No wonder Satre was so attracted to Soviet communism. Satre, perhaps the most over-rated existentialist and philosopher, could have saved the time for more womanising."
4,great descriptions of races!!,"This book had a subject matter that I am very familiar with which probably helped me appreciate it more. I found it very interesting. The detailed descriptions of races had me on the edge of my seat as if I were riding 'the biscuit' myself. It also gave a very interesting look to the actions that go on behind the scenes of horse racing. I recommend it for anyone who is interested in the biscuit's life or just horse racing in general. Although most terms are explained in footnotes, it still may be a little hard to understand for someone who knows little or nothing about racing."
5,Seabiscuit comes alive!,"I didn't expect to like this book to the degree I did. I'd read the reviews of course, but thought, no, it's just about this horse. Well, this horse seems more alive than most people, then and now. The prose is magnificent. The details are riveting. Who thought one could care about the injuries to someone 60 years ago that I'd never heard of? The helpful hints on how to lose 10 pounds overnight could be used by everyone who has a wedding to go to. The picture of this horse and his people is magnificent and something I couldn't put down. Hillenbrand spent 4 years on the research. I even read the research notes!"
4,Seabiscuit's journey,"This extremely well-researched book about the legendary horse Seabiscuit, his owner, his trainer, his jockeys, his racetrack opponents, and the world of American horse racing, especially during the 1930s, is a journey worth taking. Every character has a story and it is interesting to find out about each of them before and after their lives intersected with Seabiscuit's. Bringing out and nurturing the greatness of the unlikely looking champion Seabiscuit was a feat accomplished by special men who respected one another and this unique horse. Even if you have limited experience with horses and horse racing, you will probably enjoy the ride."
3,Amazing animal!,"I really loved the first half of this book. I loved the ending as well, but the book was about twice as long as it needed to be. I learned volumes about horse racing, but the build up for each little race kind of took away from the dramatic ending.I love the story and I do believe that Seabiscuit was a once in a lifetime horse. Now I want to see the movie!"
5,Thorough-read Book,"I admit I know little about thoroughbred racing. My lack of knowledge didn't keep me from enjoying this extremely well-written and engaging book. Laura Hillenbrand has done an exceptional job bringing the racing world of the 30s to life. I was swept up in the drama and emotion, and loved every minute of the narrative. I was fascinated by Hillenbrand's insight that as cowboys lost work on the plains, they found work in racing stables. Ultimately, it's all about the horses and she truly brings Seabiscuit to life. Congratulations to Laura Hillenbrand."
5,"Reading ""Seabiscut""","I ordered this book after seeing the movie and after reading somewhere that the author, Laura Hillenbrand, wrote it in the style of a novel. I loved the book! It is so well written - it tells the stories of the main characters and the horse so well that I read it twice.I would recommend this book to any animal lover, whether it be of dogs or cats, because they will love the true story of this remarkable horse and the people around him.Excellent read. I also jumped on youtube and watched his races and read all I could about him.Thank you for your attention."
5,My Favorite Book,"This book has loads of history(which I personally like to read about). I read it in ""record time"" it was so good. This era was so interesting with the new cars and the old horses clashing. It gives a great history of every person or animal in the book. I recomend it to anyone who can read."
5,Totally Captivating and Synchronous,The eloquently stated reviews already written I'll agree to wholeheartedly with one additional commentary. The synchronicity that Laura Hillenbrand should write THIS story having battled her own adversity is remarkable.I'll be anxious to see what she has planned for the future and I'm looking forward to seeing the film that is supposed to be in production.
4,A Depression Era History,"Dad liked this book, because it was not just a book about Seabiscuit, which he wanted, but also an interesting tale of life during the Depression."
5,This book is infectiously joyful.,"To Hillenbrand, all lives are heroic, all personality flaws are endearing quirks, and all stories are worth telling. The author makes everyone in Seabiscuit, equine as well as human, lovable. She doesn't accomplish this by editing out their various flaws and sins, but by understanding, sympathizing with, and loving these characters herself to the extent that you can't help but join her."
1,Seabiscuit,It arrived with five discs and the first one has nothing to do tith the story . It takes too long to get to the main story .
4,Seabiscuit,"Seabiscuit by Laura Hillenbrand looked like a very long, boring book when I first picked it up. But actually it turned out to be one of the best books I have ever read. It tells of a horse with a short body and terrible running form. This horse loves to eat and sleep and is thought of as lazy. This horse's name is Seabiscuit. Nobody thinks he can win, except one man. This man trains Seabiscuit to be the best he can be, and Seabiscuit shows everyone who he is. My favorite parts in the book were when Seabiscuit would look his opponents in the eye, and then leave them in the dust. He broke many records and beat the fasted horse in America at the time, War Admiral, a horse with a perfect running body. Seabiscuit is a true champion."
5,"Seabiscuit,An American Legend","Laura Hillenbrand's book captivated me. I could not put it down. And I have never been to a horse race. But I plan to see one after reading this vivid story of ""the greatest horse that ever lived...""."
1,Cover photo: the horse's rear end,This review in written solely about the cover photograph. Who in their right mind cold have chosen it? I won't end go into detail. It's so obvious.
5,Hooray for Seabiscuit!,"I really didn't know very much about horse racing nor had I ever heard of Seabiscuit. However, with this great novel that really didn't matter. The author draws you in with her crisp, detailed writing. By the end of the book, I felt like I loved Seabiscuit just as much as his fans did back in the day. I was fraught with anticipation at the outcome of Seabiscuit's nail-bitting race with War Admiral. I'm sure everyone who reads this book will love it as much as I did. I even felt a twinge of sadness that I was not able to experience what it must have been like when Seabiscuit was alive and running."
5,. . . And here they come spinning out of the turn . . .,"Hillenbrand writes a good, solid story. I know it's good because I know nothing about horse racing or for that matter, horses, and I found myself halfway through the book pulling for Red Pollard, Tom Smith and of course, The Biscuit.In that respect she is like any other competant . . . no, more than that, very competant historian, telling a tale of a particularly poignant time and wrapping that time around the lives of people we care (or would have cared) about. The 300 Spartans at the Hot Gates. Tom Verity in Korea. The numerically substantial wives of Henry, Thomas More and here, Seabiscuit.Seabiscuit didn't alter the course of American history anymore than the 1980 U.S. Hockey team sounded the death knell of Soviet communism.But maybe it did. Darn good read. Larry Scantlebury"
4,sdsrn,"Good book about a great horse. The underdog does come out on top part of the time, all it takes is a little faith."
1,One of the worst,"I love westerns, but this has to be one of the slowest moving movies I have ever seen. I'm just grateful it was a freebie from Redbox and I didn't pay to watch it. SAVE YOUR MONEY !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its not like the old ones"
1,This movie is terrible. Don't waste your money!,This movie is terrible. Don't waste your money! I really do not have much more to say about this movie.
1,Table Balance,This video would be best used to balance a shaky table. Not worth the time it takes to watch it. Save your money. Run don't walk away from this crap.
4,Individual Responsibility Exposed,"Many of us charged with leading teams are expected to take the role of 'scapegoat' for team performance. While most of us agree that the team leader does contribute (critically) to the team's success, each individual member can and does impact the team's performance. This book provides a validation that individuals impact teams and goes further to explain that every team member has an obligation to provide for the success of the team. This book helps empower those that want to make a difference in their teams."
5,Nicely Done.,"I attended Christopher Avery's Knowledge Team Leadership course and came away very impressed with his grasp of Team Dynamics (note that I did not say ""team building"" with it's touchy feely connotations""). Teamwork Is An Individual Skill is another great tool for companies interested in organizational development.Christopher takes a very practical approach. Just how does one get a group of already successful people who don't have formal authority over each other to come together as a productive team? In today's knowledge economy, time is a precious commodity. Agile, effective teams feel a sense of ""shared responsibility"" and urgency. If members of a team are not truly committed to a project, it is best to know that up front and adjust accordingly. Christopher shows us how to navigate these issues quickly. This book is well worth checking out."
1,Warning!!!!!!,"I did not buy this from amazon, and it comes in a new box at the LFS called Clearmax. I found this out the hard way, but this stuff is lethal to certain types of fish and I was using a little less than 50% of the recommended amount. Now it does trap phosphates, nitrites and nitrates as it states on the box. Water tests are coming up practically zero for each range but at the cost of many fish. Arowanas are especially sensitive to this stuff. Please be careful when using. I will never use this stuff again. I bought it thinking it would help remove some phosphates from a freshwater tank with an algae bloom issue when all i really needed was a UV clarifier/sterilizer. I had no issues with the fish before using this stuff other than some algae bloom. I do weekly water changes and all the water tests were good."
3,Great sound - horrible set-up and instructions,"I bought this for my elderly father (87). I set the unit up for him, but the manual was so confusing I had to call Phillips for help. The manual that comes with the MC-50 is for THREE separate stereos, so trying to figure out which instructions pertains to the MC-50 and which do not is difficult. The buttons on the remote are confusing; the labels are not in the right places.The sound quality is good, however, the cd-changers clang away which I found quite annoying. In the past I've liked Phillips products, but if this unit had been for myself, I would have returned it."
1,broke in 1st month,very disappointed...the cd tray broke within the 1st month of use & Amazon.com was no help in getting it fixed...
4,wonderful CD,"I saw the video for ""My Ship"" and found Bernard Fowler to be just stunning. And the music is definitely mood setting - makes you fall in love with love again. I was lucky enough to hear them perform a few years ago."
1,Gospel According to America,"This book is a difficult read, with too many obscure references to Southern United States literature and music that many folks are not familiar with.Mr. Dark took a really interesting topic, the cultural divide as it relates to the arts, and ends up with a convoluted book. This book was to be the basis for a church class, but was soon discarded. I give the book one star. This is more than generous."
4,Bold and provocative challenge to the art world.,"Robert Hughes tries to position himself somewhere in between Karen Finley and Jesse Helms in his essays about the politics of art in America. The result is that he comes out about where the Supreme Court has found itself in June 1998 -- linked to Jesse Helms anyway by critics, despite trying hard to distance himself. He apparently thinks Karen Finley is a fraud, and that's just not what the art crowd wants to hear. It was courageous of Hughes to write the book, which contains the seeds of ""American Visions"" (also worth reading)."
2,An essay that you think you should read,"This is one of those books that you read and enjoy and then remember virtually nothing about the contents, at least for me. It looks at the multi-culturalism wars in the US, sprinkles in some ineresting examples, and then ends. I don't mean to be glib, as I respect the author and love his writing style and erudition, but that is all that it meant to me. I can not even remember clearly what his opinion was on multi-culturalism, and I just read it! The book just kind of rambles and I never understood why the author chose to write about the details that he did. That to me is a sign that the essay fails, though perhaps it didn't click for me alone, as others liked it better.Not recommended."
1,"Overheats, won't play","The cassette door wouldn't open and if I played mp3s for about 2 hours, it would overheat and wouldn't play anymore until it cooled off for an hour or so."
4,Great Product bad screws,"I purchased three of these to donate to a state park. I thought the directions were poor but once I looked at them a 3rd time it was fine. However, for those using treated lumber the screws would be eaten up in short fashion by the chemicals used to treat the lumber. I purchased deck screws but the heads were too small so ended up using washers to keep the heads from slipping through. All in all they came out great. Anxious to see how they faired the winter since they were suppose to be stored inside but I doubt that they did."
3,notice,They need make sure the info is clear because of image show info that all package come together. When it arrive only two piece in boxes. Puls need spend more money on lumber to build that not make sense but i took and do anyway. I still like the bench anyway.
5,Long lasting indeed!,"I bought this to use with my Ultra Mini Venue Fog Machine. As some reviewers noted, you will have to dilute this fog juice for the Ultra Mini Venue Fog Machine, and I imagine with other lower-end machines. The manufacturer recommends 1/3 distilled water, but I've found that I have to use a little more distilled water than that. Anyway, I used this in my dorm room last night. I filled up my entire room, and the dorm complex. And let me say the fog lasts long! At one point I had to turn on air ventilation, fans, and open my windows and doors for about 10-15 minutes before it finally cleared out. Works great, and will make lasers or any other kind of light beam look stunning!"
5,The most exciting book. RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,A story about two sisters and their 2 cousins that spend a summer they'll never forget. The most exciting part of the book when one of the left out sister(Sarah) try to prove she can be a rimmwalker. It was a life and death situation. To find out if she lives or dies reed the book or even bye the book.
5,Very effective diet,"I do this diet and I also follow dr Abravanel's theories on body type diet and the results are amazing. On high carb days I prefer potatoes, noodles, rice, honey, veggies and fruits. On low carb I eat meat, eggs and greens. As someone else said before, it is really nice to see your flat stomach every morning. ALthough I eat more than 3 meals, the results are really impressive."
2,book includes religious proselytizing,"Altho the information in the book may have been interesting, I found it hard to get past the christian religious references the author interspersed throughout the book. I might not have minded if I had chosen to buy the book knowing that he dedicated it to god, after he had a breakdown and made a deal with god to share the word if god only saved him -- but I found it offensive to discover that after I spent the money. I did plough through several chapters anyway, but was so put off at the whole ""glory to god"" thing that I stopped. I donated the book to the library, so someone who is not offended by unsolicited proselytizing can maybe get some benefit out of it, but I also wanted to warn other buyers to be aware of the hidden (perhaps not hidden, but undeclared) agenda."
5,It Works,"In the automotive market, there's a lot of snake oil. Most of it is just junk. Some products do nothing. Those are the good ones. The bad ones screw up your car. This is one of the few that actually work. It keeps your fuel delivery system clean. I use Lucas Oil with every fill up. When I change the fuel filter, clean gasoline comes trickling out. In cars without it, I usually see black gunk spill back out of the fuel filter. This is not a cure-all in a single serving bottle. But if used regularly, over time, you will see results."
5,Great Latin Style EuroDance / Weak ballads,"""Fiesta"", ""Amor de Papel"", and ""Tu y yo"" are all great dance tracks--pretty much EuroDance style, just in Spanish. The ballads are a bit out of place on the album though. Great second album by this female/male Mexican duo."
2,Bad blade,Purchased this item to help in field dressing my own deer. After one cutting the bone blade was bent. Flimsy but can still cut. Just makes it difficult.
1,useless,"I found this book to be completely useless. It did have some promising parts, but there is one underlying problem with it:DUKE NUKEM 3D IS THE EASIEST GAME TO FIND STUFF FOR ON THE WEB EVER. This means that a book will not be bought by many people. Sorry, but it's true."
3,no wes,"Candy ass smooth jazz version of Wes. Why bother, go straight to the original and buy anything by Wes. Even the horrible Sebesky arrangements on Wes's most aggregious records are better than this pablum. Rit is capable of much better, but most of his career has been marred by the smooth jazz edge (or lack of edge) that permeates most of his output."
4,Waddabout the keyboards?,I'm mainly buying this album for the smoking Hammond organ playing which features on several tracks that I remember from a 'sampler' CD I heard quite a few years ago now. My friend worked for a radio station that was sent the sampler as a forerunner (I guess) to the album's release.
1,walk away from the stereo...,"Shoddily made. I bought it two years ago, and it already needs to be replaced. It started turning on spontaneously a month after I bought it, and by now the CD changer barely works."
5,ACTION PACKED WESTERN,"This is an action packed Western, with less swearing, and better acting. Bob Handigan plays a good role in this movie, and after seeing it--I know you won't be disappointed. This movie is a cross between HIGH NOON and TOMBSTONE."
2,Disbelieve the Culture of Disbelief,"What purports to be a well-constructed lament of the destruction of religion's credibility in the public sphere steadily degenerates into wishy-washy stances on Establishment clause cases and numerous analytic misinterpretations of Alexis de Tocqueville's and Thomas Jefferson's views on religion and civil society. This book's one redeeming feature is its treatment of recent Free Exercise cases, particularly its call for a broader range of religious exemptions to generally applicable laws. Carter is at his best criticizing the Supreme Court for its Employment Division v. Smith decision; otherwise Carter himself should be the target of criticism for flimsy argumentation."
1,Emperors New Clothes!,"I am a big Jazz and Blues fan and Nina is up there with the greats but who was she kidding with this dreadful album. Her singing is way off key, she sounds drunk and uninterested.Saying that she wanted to be remembered for this album was Ninas little joke!, which no one on this page seems to get!Buy 'Nuff Said' instead its fantastic!"
5,18 Buddha Hands Qigong-DVD,Enjoyed the DVD. At first it was a little hard to follow but I also bought the book and between the two I was able to learn the movements. I would recommend buying both.
4,Odor Out-222,"This product works pretty good, I plan to order a refill size to fill the small bottles that came with the order."
4,Solid and helpful,"This book is essential for anyone who wants to know about western European medieval hunting. Cummins admirably completes the task of being thorough, with frequent references to and quotations of primary texts. The structure makes the book easy to follow and inclusions of anecdotes and poems makes the reading fun.This book captures both the practice and the romance of hunting throughout the centuries of the middle ages. It is generous of detail. My one complaint might be that there is little attempt to discuss different practices in different regions of Europe, though the author acknowledges the existence of slight regional variations and does try to delve into them here and there.It is hard to imagine that any other book on the subject need be written for some time."
5,Book commeents.,"This was an interesting and captivating story. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about how our Federal ""justice"" system works."
2,Not the best entry,"I read Death Takes a Honeymoon in two days and the more I thought about the book, the less I decided I enjoyed it. Were there any likeable characters at all? The story was very uneven and there wasn't enough development of Julie, one of the most interesting characters. By the time I got to the cliffhanger ending I decided I didn't really care what happened to Carnegie and Aaron after all. What I did enjoy was the change of venue to Idaho. I was disappointed enough in this outing between unlikeable characters and disjointed plot that I am not sure I will continue with the series."
4,one of the most original books I've ever read,"Midget punks, torture, stripshows and cold blooded murder. A completely original and thrilling book."
3,"good, not great","the book was new, but there was a little pen mark on the side and the pages were cut irregularly like if not everything went as it was supposed to be in production. no problem to read though and I paid about nothing for it"
3,Coby Photo Keychain,"The photo display on the keychain may be a wonder to behold, but if I can't load my pictures it is a keychain, not a ""photo"" keychain. I saw nothing in the marketing to advise me DPFMate would not work on Windows 7. I can find no place online to get an update to Windows 7.BEWARE Win 7 users.UPDATE: I stand corrected and am happy to say I was wrong. I switched to another USB connection and the software came up fine. Now have my pictures loaded. Picture display quality is good in a dim light. A zoom feature would be very useful."
3,coby digital key chain,"This is a good low cost product. If you are looking for a high quality picture look at something a little more expensive. It also has this annoying slide show feature that is impossible to turn off. However, for a 20 dollar digital keychain it is a good buy and very cute. Made a great stocking stuffer!"
1,Not Mac compatible,"The product was advertised as Mac compatible. Not true. The PhotoView software, needed to load the keychain digital frame, would not recognize the device when connected to my iMac G5 (OS 10.5.1). I tried it on an older iMac G4, running 10.4.11, and thought I was having better luck, as the software did see the device, but the software crashed when I tried to load pictures. I requested help from Coby, but an apparently automated support bot just kept sending me the same PhotoView software I was running. So I decided to return the frame. Then, to top it off, 6Ave decided to charge me a restocking fee for returning a defective product!"
1,Sara A,I don't know how Amazon would even want to carry a product that is this crappy! I had to call tech support and they told me the item was defective because it kept saying can not connect to device so I figured I would try another and STILL the same error message and the only thing COBY Tech support can say is the device must be defective! Looks like Amazon gets this one back to!
4,Awesome gift!,"This keychain is awesome! I bought one for each of my nephews for Christmas. The directions for the software were not as clear as they could have been (only reason I didn't give it 5 stars), but once you figure it out, it's pretty easy and great quality! Holds 60 pics!!"
4,Great for what you are paying for,"Great item as a replacement for the purse/wallet picture stack. With 3-4hr charge time, should be able to show plenty of people favorite photos of kids, grandkids, vacation spot, family, ect.4 star because it requires charging only by USB port. Recognize at this price point a charger could not be supplied, but a solution to work with a common charger style would be nice. Especially when this is a gift for those not tech savvy, or actually without a computer (grandparents and parents - yes, no computer).Nice requirement to hold down On/Off button to turn on - no accidental battery drain.Recommend using something like free IrfanView to mass convert desired pre-cropped pictures to 128x128 byte size. Not sure how well the included software does it, or how slow it would have been.But when already done, the upload is very quick. Software and instructions don't match up exactly, and app buttons used aren't in order of use, but can still figure it out."
1,I'm really disappointed,"I bought this as a present, but the minute that I turned it off it didn't turned on anymore. The battery is terrible, I don't recommend for anybody."
2,Not enough battery life.,"All in all I like this product; it has a nice glossy black finish, but the problem is the battery life. I use it on my pants as a ""quickgrabber"" for my car keys, so I'd like it to be on a whole day at least, since using it off makes it an ordinary (and expensive) key chain. I got two, one for my wife and the other for me; both have the same problem.Miguel."
3,O.K. Item,"The Price was good. The screen is smaller than I expected. It looks bigger in the picture. It could also be a little brighter, but overall its an O.K. product."
1,Did not work with Vista on a Dell C521,"I spent an hour with mom's Dell C521 PC with Vista trying to get the software to connect with the keychain. No dice.I followed the procedure in the manual to the letter, repeated several times, tried variations, downloaded the software from the cobyusa website, all ending in frustration.Like mom said: ""nothing should be this big a hassle."""
4,Coby DP-151 1.5 Digital Photo Key Chain,"Easy to use, picture screen is a little small. I was just at CVS and saw a similar Digital Photo Key Chain with a much larger screen, it was originally $59.00, marked down to $19.99, if you have a CVS card, it's $17.00. That seems like a better deal, screen is about double the size and holds same amount of pictures."
1,Hard to work with,"I found this product hard to work with. I spent over a week with their tech center to finally get it to work. Then after getting five pictures transferred to it, I was told the pictures were to big and the device could not handle anymore. I would have to reduce the pictures to transfer them to the device, It seems to me the software should be able to do this. Product not ready for normal market use, only a real techie could probably use this product.Coby DP-151 1.5-Inch Digital Photo Key Chain"
4,Colby digital photo keychain,"I ordered two of these from Amazon.com for my son and sister for Christmas. Such a nice gift for anyone. To be so small, it really does show good pictures. It's very easy to upload and add photos to it. My son has pictures of his girlfriend on his to look at all day at school! Ha! Ha! I'm glad I ordered these and would buy more in the future. Very happy buyer!"
1,Don' t like it at all!,I thought it was gonna be perfect little gift for a friend. But the pictures on it were totally blur. I wish I couldn' t get that one!
1,do not buy,"so hit or miss if it will work. i bought two for christmas gifts and one worked fine, and the other never did. i guess you get what you pay for, but this was a major waste of money."
1,Unfriendly Device,"The key chain became unusable after I clicked ""Cancel"" when the autorun started. My computer could not read it afterwards, and tried in other comupters as well. Openned a second key chain, and the autorun did not even started, and got ""unreadable"" device message. Contacted Covey support and I never got a message from them. I returned all the items I had bought. I am glad Amazon accepts returns and I got my refund."
1,Not worth the effort,"I wanted to give 2 keychains to newlyweds along with a photo album. I downloaded the software to the Vista OS with success, selected the pictures, but I could never download the images. A call to tech support stated that ""I shouldn't say, but it's not Vista compatible."" He suggested that I try it with XP OS which I did. XP wouldn't even allow the program to download. I'm returning them. Too bad, it was a good idea for gifts."
1,Problems using software????,"Seemed like a good idea, but try using the software to download photos. Will have to call customer/tech support. Should be more user friendly. Flynn Gentry-Taylor"
2,"Bought 4, 1 dead","I bought 4 of these for Mothers Day gifts. One of them had to be returned since it was DOA. The other three all worked with my PC once I downloaded the latest driver from the COBY website. Unfortunately, most of my images are on my Mac using iPhoto. I never could get these to work on my Mac, so I simply copied them over to a network drive and used their driver/software under Parallels. That worked great. Too bad that I couldn't get it to work on my Mac though. Also, the images once transferred over aren't the best quality, but what do you expect for that price?I will say that all the people that received them as gifts were tickled. They just loved the key chain pre-loaded with images."
1,Digital photo key chain,"I purchased this item as a Christmas present for my wife. I tried for a bit to load this products software on my Dell Window's PC, and was not successful. I honestly haven't pursued a solution yet but after reading others reviews prior to purchasing, I believed it possible to work with. More to follow."
2,Coby DP 151 1.5 digital photo keychain,Yhis is very hard to get to intall on computer. We still havent figured it out. I also sent 2 back for a refund and they shorted me 9.99 on my return. Amazon contacted the seller and I still havent heard anything.
1,Not compatable.,This digital key chain is more complicated than others I have used. I purchased three different brands of key chains for X-mas gifts for various people. This is the only one I couldn't get to work. This one came with a installation CD that I could not install and therefore could not load pictures on the key chain. Other key chains come with a USB cord and you are on your way. I ended up returning this one and buying another at a store on Christmas Eve.
1,coby dp151 Key chain digital photo black,"I received mine for christmas and it is awful. It did not come with a disc and I have windows vista which has been nothing but a nightmare. I hate it and would never ever recommend this product to anyone. I wish I had never received it. It is the worst thing I have ever had to work with. This Coby product is awful and I am putting the word out about this product, please do not waste your money on this product because this is a piece of junk!!!"
1,How can people be fooled like this!?!?!,"I can't understand how COBY fool people with their cheap products. The worst quality you can find on the market. Their customer service is horrible. In my personal case the item arrived, it was a gift for my boss's wife, she told me ""the item can't connect"", i took the item for testing, like 3 different operating systems on five laptops, nothing, the item was impossible to connect, followed all sort of guides online and nothing. Making the story short, i smashed the item with a hammer, told the woman i lost it and offered a replacement, another type of item, jewelry. Everything went fine after that, just that i lost my few bucks. HATE YOU COBY."
1,Worst product,"Very poor quality body. The images are not clear at all.This is cheap in price as well as quality. It gets stuck when i tried to disconnect from the laptop. The ""USB connected"" screen appears even after disconnecting. Sheer waste of $5!"
1,stopped working after 1 week,"i am very disappointed with this. After 1 week i can't get it to turn on, it is even dead when i hook it up to my computer."
3,"Its cheap, but you get what you pay for","With this thing being $5-10, don't expect some amazing high quality 1080p photos! It's cute, may not last long, and probably easily breakable. With that being said, it's still a great stocking stuffer and we have bought several for our friends."
1,Absolute garbage,The title says it all: absolute garbage. Don't waste your money on this POS. It simply does not work regardless of your computer's OS. I threw it away...where it belongs. Avoid!!!!!!
2,"Bad picture quality, terrible software","3 monkeys typing randomly on 3 computers for 3 hours could've produced software that was better than what's included with this piece of junk.You can't just resize and copy your own photos to the keychain -- they force you to use their custom software, and it's unintuitive and difficult to use. For example, you can't select all of the photos in a directory and load them all at once; you need to click ""Add"" 60 times to add 60 photos (which is the max you can put on the keychain). Not only that, but the instruction manual doesn't even describe the interface properly. They must've made changes to the software since publishing the manual.The image quality is extremely poor; only close-ups of faces appear with any detail. Its only saving grace is that it's only $10, and that it works, more or less."
2,size of item is wrong...,"Just a quick note to say that the size they have listed is wrong. They say ""3x2x3; 2 lbs"". The actual size is 2.1x1.1x.5, and only a few ounces.A 2 lb keychain?Wow."
3,little wonder works well - software is old,"The Coby 1.5"" digital photo keychain is a very nice, innovative product. I purchased several units to praise a project team and all were very pleased. The only drawback I see is its software PhotoViewer: it's too old for this day and age and not too intuitive."
1,Santa says No No No!,"I got this for my 60+ year-old Dad. There is no freaking way I'm going to saddle him with this ""poorly designed"" ""badly programed"" and ""difficult to use"" (read the other reviews) thing.I got it plugged in once, thought I had added the pix and unplugged to check it out. Nope... and now I get the message ""can't find any photoviewer, or another program owns it, the program will exit!"" every time I try to do anything with it.If you're lonely and have no one to talk to, buy this. You'll at least have Coby's tech support people to chat with...."
1,Waste of money,"I bought two...one for my husband as a Christmas gift and one to save for myself when our baby arrives. I figured we'd both want to have baby pictures to show and would not have room for wallet photos. However, his froze after loading five sample pictures and we were never able to get it working again even after the battery discharged and we restarted it. So we opened mine early, and it did not work at all. I tried to email the company through Amazon but have not received any reply, not even a confirmation of complaint receipt. What junk...and a double waste of money."
1,Broken when opened,"This product says that it can be used with a mac...but the installation disk could not be used with my mac. I learned that the software can be downloaded from coby's website for anyone else having this problem.Then I tried hooking it up to install pictures. Went through the process and it wouldn't work. As soon as I went to sync the product with my computer and download the pictures onto the device the software would shut down and no pictures would be installed. I called Coby and they gave me a few troubleshooting tips...none of which worked. When I called back they said that the item must have been defective and to return it through amazon.Company seems OK, but you need to call to get a return authorization number before sending it back. I have not been able to do so yet so can't comment."
1,Read the reviews from the people that gave this movie 1 star,"Not sure why some people said this movie kept them smiling, as it is not actually trying to be funny most of the time. Marisa Tomei has tears in her eyes more often then a smile on her face.Pretty slow and nowhere near as good as all these Amazon reviews lead us to believe. Even at just $2.99 I feel we could have found something better to occupy our two hours."
3,"Acting is top notch, but . . .","This movie is listed a a romantic comedy and is anything but funny. Marisa Tomei is a superb actor and carries this movie, much like every movie she's in. However, she also seems to have a penchant for starring in these weird melodramas where it could been much more enjoyable without so much drama. Her great acting makes you want to know how the story turns out, so you watch until the end. I do not regret having ordered or watched the movie, but if someone had warned me ahead of time I would have picked it for a day when I wasn't in the mood for a romantic comedy. Advice: Marisa Tomei fans -- do watch. You won't be disappointed."
3,good book,Got it as a freebie so it was well worth the price. Will definitely use the book store again for lots of free books that I haven't read.
5,Happy Accidents funny movie,Vincent D'Onofrio and Marisa Tomei are great together in this romantic-comedy. His explantions are totally off the wall and her strength to believe in him leads too many funny situations. Highly recommend.
3,Viewed,It was a movie rental ---I veiwed this did not purchase. No fault of the website or seller. I hope I don't have to answer for everything I have looked at and not purchased.... little tiring.
4,Quirky & engaging.,"I happened upon this little gem of a movie, on t.v. After that I had to own it so that I could watch it again. I wanted to puzzle out some of the plot points, since the first time around,you look at the events going on skeptically, just like Marisa Tomei's character does in the movie. The premise of the movie is that, Vincent D'Onofrio's character, SamDeed, came from the future, just to be with & save Marisa's character from an upcoming accident. She meets Sam's explanations about this & the future he came from with skepticism, eventually she believes him as did I. I won't say any more about whether Sam is crazy or really from the future. This is discovered in the last part of the movie. I really enjoyed this movie. It works on several different levels. It's Sci-Fi, a Romance, & a Mystery, all in one. The performances are very good, the music adds to the offbeat nature of this movie. Overall very well constructed. I purchased it from Amazon & it arrived in good shape."
3,AN IDEA ALREADY USED,"ALOL is an incredibly solid band. You have to be a very solid unit playing this type of music. That is essentially the best part of the album. Everything is produced so well and the breakdowns are ever so ""dancible."" I just still cannot get over how much they ripped off Meshuggah's sound on this album. No one can top those crazy Swedes- NO ONE. This album is good, but its not original at all. They don't really have a polyrhythmic structure either- there are some notable parts in some songs, but for the most part there aren't any really difficult or hard to follow time signatures. Good dance practice beats- Meshuggah kicks their ass though."
2,Pure garbage,"again, pure garbage, i gave it two because this album sticks in my head so much and i love laughing to it's crappiness."
5,organic groove,"obviously the way alol play the riffs on this album (bending the strings) sounds very similar to meshuggah, but oh well it is an incredibly pummeling album none the less,and anyone who is a meshuggah fan should find it very enjoyable to listen to this album ,and i think the only reason people are bitchin about it is because they apparently think that alol are going to steal what meshuggah has, and believe me that will never happen..so if u dont have this cd go buy it ecspecially if you love meshuggah and sidewinder bending type riffs like meshuggah use ever so frequently.."
5,Outstanding.,"When I listen to A Great Artist, then something by Meshuggah (Nothing is the album I think is closest in style), I enjoy the differences. ALOL clearly has hardcore influences with their Meshuggah framework. It's a lower-brow sound, easier to bob your head to and just relax while listening to.Recommended if you like hardcore, meshuggah, or techno."
3,Healthy Veggies,"These are a healthy snack alternative I was hoping my kids would like. The taste isn't all I had hoped it would be so I am eating them, not the kids.Still, eating just a serving gives you a punch of the veggies you need in a day."
4,Conway's Essential Country Recordings,"This collection of Conway's music focuses on his country music recording career from 1968 until his death. It collects most but not all of his number one country hits. The sound of the CD is fresh and sonically bold. What I appreciated about the collection is the inclusion of his earlier country material which holds up much better than his 80's-90's output which veared from the honty tonk steal guitar sound that first got him on the charts. Although Conway was sort of the poor man's Elvis, his strong voice works well in the country ballad milleau. If one wants the early rock n roll or more emphasis on the later pop oriented songs, another collection would be better. Too bad this style of country music isn't found on the charts today."
5,If you cast your own bullets,This tool is for bringing a bullet down to size and applying lubrication. It works well and does what it is supposed to. The picture shown in incorrect because the package does not include the top punch. I would anticipate this little die will get a lot of work done through it.
5,Interesting bluegrass album full of quality,"By the time Suzanne recorded this album, she was a veteran of the bluegrass and old-time country music scene, having previously sung with the Hotmud family and the Dry branch fire squad.Sweet sunny south, Just a few more days, Faded coat of blue, I have no mother now and are all over fifty years old and you don't them very often these days. Another song of comparable vintage, Miss the Mississippi and you, is better known, having been covered by Emmylou Harris, Crystal Gayle and others down the years.We must have been out of our minds was a sixties country hit duet for George Jones and Melba Montgomery, while Louisiana woman Mississippi man was a seventies country hit duet for Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn.The remaining songs are contemporary, including some co-written by Suzanne. Overall, this album has a variety of songs of different tempos, all performed to a high standard. If you enjoy traditional bluegrass, you should enjoy this."
2,Big Disappointment!,"After recently reading the first 3 books (that she wrote 20 years ago) this read was a bad sequel. The first three were historical romances in which she nailed it. She clearly forgot the formula which made the trilogy so popular. The way the characters came together was way too contrived even when you want to suspend belief because you're reading for entertainment--not to mention the unnecessary addition of some characters becoming ""joined"" mentally with others. Well, there I did mention it. It seemed clearly created to add some drama that was more difficult to create in modern day than in the fifteenth century apparently."
1,bland - don't waste your time,"Lacks intelligence needed to support a true thriller - stereotypical situation with an absence of character development and plot depth. I am writing this review simply because I was horrified about the positive comments, yet I wasted 3 hours of my life reading this..."
2,Convoluted tale that wasn't overly believable,"Heard the taped version of Iris Johnansen's FINAL TARGET,a somewhat convoluted tale about a kidnapped girl who justhappens to be the daughter of the President of the UnitedStates . . . I just didn't find it believable, nor did I care for anyof the main characters . . . only the ending, which involveda love story of sorts, managed to pique my interest . . . I alsofound Carolyn McCormick's narration excellent; in fact, muchbetter than the book."
2,a disappointment,"It has all the elements of a good romance mystery...but they are never developed. I think she did a poor job of giving the characters depth. The story line is just too unbelievable. Lots of disappointments in this book, I would recommend you borrow it from a friend it you have to read it. Don't waste your money."
2,Ho Hum,"This is a very so,so thriller. I kept on thinking ""So what?"" If you need something to read on a plane, a train, or just help you relax on a Friday night this the book for you."
4,A Fast Paced Read,"A Very good paranormal romantic suspense book. I was caught up in the story and didn't want to put it down. The hero was caught up in his own agenda, already set into motion, when he learned the president's daughter was in danger. He stepped in to help but still had to finish his dealings. This took away from the book for some but I thought it made a ""one step ahead of the killer"" fast paced read."
2,Where was the plot???,"This book started with a bang--the attempted abduction of a First Daughter, treachery by a trusted nanny, and the introduction of characters who seemed interesting at first glimpse. Unfortunately, the plot falls apart--too many unrelated and unbelievable subplots--the CIA and manmade Russian diamonds, a mysterious mental link between the President's daugher and her 'rescuers', and a golden statue with alleged special powers. There's also a lot of soap opera type dialogue about strong women, living life to the fullest, sharing 'joy' and seeking revenge. The main characters are never brought fully to life and a promising beginning soon becomes muddled.Although I'm a fan of this author's previous books, I will definitely not buy any new offerings....and I'm very glad that this one only cost me the 25 cent library reserve fee!"
4,The Others are coming...,"If the concept of a hoard of Royalist vampires attacking from Scotland and trying to reclaim the English crown sounds a bit corny, don't worry - it really works.William Meikle has managed to forge a dark and compelling story by taking some exciting British history and his own brand of vampire story telling and then giving them a good mix.The story introduces us to Martin and Sean, two soldiers of the Hadrian's Wall watch who are tasked with looking after a traveller and his daughter who arrive from the north.Between them, their stories introduce the reader to the history of the Others and how they plan to retake the throne.As the first part of a trilogy, it sets the scene perfectly for the remainder of the series - and I, for one, can't wait for the next book."
1,Extrordinarily Angry,"I purchased this kit to use on a rebuild for an existing motor. I stored it very carefully so that I would be confident in the contents. When I received the motor back from the machine shop, I pulled the pristine box from the shelf and began sorting the gaskets. The only issue was that the head gasket was bent right down the middle of cylinders 2 and 3. The fire ring around cylinder 3 has lifted away from the surrounding material. While all of this would be under pressure once assembled, I cannot in good conscience use this gasket. Which means I'm stuck with purchasing an additional gasket that I should have absolutely no need for. To add insult to injury, Amazon's return policy does not allow for any modification to the order now that I'm outside of the return window. I cannot lay blame for the oversight with anyone save for myself, but I also feel that there should be some kind of remedy for unused defective merchandise."
4,Good and gracious,"Sometimes the healing process can hurt. Job was a person like us and all of us can see a little bit of Job in us. Chambers masterfully brings out the fact that suffering IS NOT the curse of God or because we have committed wrongs. Job is shown to be moving CLOSER to God in his tribulation rather than further from God [which some modern commentaries do]--suffering, trials and problems ARE a part of human existence and better is the person who will see God ABOVE it as they must travel through it.Baffled to Fight Better is EXACTLY what postmoderns need to lessen the anger against God when rough times come. God is NOT the author of confusion."
3,Another WWE Exaggeration,"I was disappointed in the documentary. Despite some very interesting spots, it comes off as more of a polished fluff piece for wrestling fans. The WWE has apparently never been shy about exaggeration. Even this DVD promises their fans a running time of 9 hours but actually delivers only about 7 hours. The first disc features the documentary running a little over two hours. The second and third discs feature almost 5 hours of matches selected from the Wrestlemania events."
1,Not worth a glimpse,This DVD COULD HAVE been a great in depth look into the secret behind the scenes life of Wrestlemania. But it eneded up being one huge Vince Mcmahon self glorifying DVD. I asked myself one question after I watched this DVD. What do I know now that I didn't know before I watched the DVD...and the answer sadly is nothing.
4,A truely handbook,Though not too much deeper into each topic the book addresses the key on most of the main issues related to portrait photography. I found it one of the most useful books in portrait photography.
2,You get what you pay for...,"This guitar footstool doesn't live up to it's name, ""Tour Grade,"" which implies heavy duty, at least in my mind. It didn't take much foot pressure to bend one of the legs just enough to make it wobble and move around under foot. I guess you get what you pay for. The plan now is to visit a Guitar Center so that I can see and test the replacement for this footrest."
5,"Works great, price is right!","My 7 year old daughter is learning to play the electric guitar and her guitar teacher has a similar foot rest at his studio. She asked me to get her one like it for when she practices at home. It comes in a nylon draw string bag and is easy to set up and use. It has three height adjustments to find that sweet spot in comfort when playing for longer sessions. For the price it's lightweight, sturdy, and useful, what more could you ask for?"
4,Shower Curtain Liner,good price; the holes for the shower curtain rings hopefully will be strong enough; they are not reinforced with metal.
5,Love it!,My baby loves this book! We've read it to her since she was about 2 months old and repeats the Oooooo noise after you. It's so cute to read it with her and we've bought it for multiple gifts.
5,MUST HAVE!!,"What a great book to read out loud, perfect to read to a young ones anytime to let them know whatever they do whatever they are you love them. If there is one Sandra Boynton's book you want to buy this would be it!"
5,Baby Soother!,"My son adores this song and the book. He loves the version that Eric Stoltz sings on the Philadelphia Chickens CD. Ever since he was about 4 months old, I could turn on this song and he would go from screaming to silent instantly! Not long after, he usually fell asleep. It's saved my sanity countless times!"
5,"Fuzzy little snuggle puppy, I love you!","Our 20 month old hasn't yet started talking, really, (just ""cat"" and ""eat,"" and something ""mama""-like that sounds more like ""mehmeh"") but he LOVES this book.He will jabber to himself and ""read"" it, doing the OOOOOOOs every time the parent dog does.The book is just as charming for adults, with its unisex parent dog and puppy, its clever little rhyme/song and sweet message. The cartoons are well-done and simple and the heart cut-out on the front cover is a source of additional hilarity when parents or kids look through the heart at the other.The board book is more sturdily built than most, meaning it will likely survive until our son graduates to other sorts of books -- not something that can be said about most board books, unfortunately.This is a must-buy childrens' book for parents of small children, in my opinion."
2,Don't like to talk down to my child.,"I feel like a complete idiot reading this book to my child. Yes, books should be fun and have colorful illusrtations, but I would rather read something that has a story/plot. I feel as if I am talking down to my child when reading this, or dumbing down the act of reading books together. Many of Boynton's books are very appealing, and I understand their popularity. This is not one of my favorites, and as for her other books, I can take them in small doses."
5,Excellent,"This spice was just as easy as all the other nesco jerky spice kits. Usually when something is marketed as hot and spicy, it's not really all that hot or spicy... but this is. It has a very good flavor to go along with the spice. The heat is not over bearing, but it is there, and it is good."
1,I've heard better,"Usually i love Eric Clapton's music but this one...sounded like a couple of guys sitting down to jam with no focus or direction...Hokey, folky and simplistic.Probably some die hard Clapton fan would love it but i was very disappointed."
1,Poor,This was very disappointing.Poorly written uninspired songs with little excitement.Look elsewhere for grown up music like Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris's All the Roadrunning or Lee Roy Parnell's Back To The Well.
5,Great duo - Clapton & JJ Cale,"The music is great if you like either or both of these guys. Early reviews has it EC had to add JJ since most were Cale's tunes. That being said, the two are great together and there are several really catchy tunes you'll play in your head all day long. Highly recommended..."
4,JJ-Clapton,"Pleasant and very listenable, not the best of either artist by a long shot. If I wasn't an admirer of JJ from way back, I might not ""get it"". It's just great to hear something fresh from a couple of legends."
3,"technically teriffic, emotionally in ""old coot"" land","Two of the greats have collaborated for a half-great record. ""Hard to Thrill"" and the catchy ""Ride the River"" are truly fine, and ""Sporting Life Blues"" is fun. ""Three little girls"" is obviously from EC's heart, as is ""When this war is over"" from JJC's. Everyone's musicianship is fine, including guests Billy Preston, John Meyer and Taj Mahal. But several tunes are just, well, boring."
1,Road To Escondido,"Nothing exciting about this collection of trite old standard tunes.Two artists of this calliber can surely come up with a few good riffs.Entire album survives on the legedary names involved,not on content.Anyone interested in a discounted copy?"
2,desilusion,"como se les ocurrio cantar a duo y grabarse de esa manera, fastidioso, la banda buenisima, que desperdicio, soy fan de los dos por separado, pero creo que por razones de ego, ninguno queria lucirse sobre el otro, missed oppotunity."
3,It's all american music,"I have expected more from the cooperation of these two Giants. Nevertheless it's a genuine american music CD and it's worth buying it. You will only need to listen it in a very hot summer atmosphere, while relaxing."
3,Good Book just wish the class I took was better,This book was the only reason I got anything out of the class that I took on Automation and Robotics. It is very informative and easy to ready. the questions and problems at the end of each chapter also help reinforce the chapters concepts. Practical uses!
4,justice league doen it again,"This is Rapper Big Pooh of Little Brother. We were first acquainted with the flow of this cat little brother's debut album 'The Listening'. This is his first solo album and a dope one at that. I must have slept on it since I bought it; I only just started to listen to it properly. But i tell you what a mistake I made. The production courtesy of 9th wonder and Khrysis. Standout tracks are 'NOW' featuring MURS of the living legends crew whose album you should get too. And 'MY MIND' which is such a tight song. If you repping the real hip hop then go get this joint , you wont regret it ."
2,Out with a wimper,"Let me start by saying i'm a huge love fan. but a earlier reviewer called this love's second best album. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. this is love's worst album, by far. the album is around 30 minutes. the lyrics seem like they were made up on the spot. the songs sound like they were thrown together very quickly, not developed after the initial inspiration. if not for the everlasting first and keep on shining, this would be totally worthless.after hearing this i'm glad love called it quits after this album.(i'm not counting reel to real, because its really a solo album, with about 20 musicians on it. if you realy want to hear love at their best, get their first 4 albums."
4,Good Headphones,"The product is great for when I mow the grass. The John Deere lawn mower makes plenty of noise, but I can put these headphones on and it cuts out most of the noise. Plus, I like the behind the neck design because it doesn't lay on top of my boonie hat and put the sides down like the over the head headphones."
3,Consider the price...,"Considering the price, these aren't so bad. The noise cancelling works to a point (not as good as more expensive ones though) and the sound is average. For less than 10 bucks, this is incredible.That said, I would really recommend spending a bit more and getting at least the AIWA phones (still below $40) - they are already way better.You get what you pay for."
3,Cool Headphones,"I must say these are ok headphones. Mine were damaged though. The sound is good, a bit big on the head."
1,"Don't Buy, Don't Make My Mistake","As most people have pointed out, these headphones are unbearably uncomfortable, and I do mean COMPLETELY unbearable. I couldn't stand to wear them for any longer then 5 minutes. It's just awful that these were even allowed to be produced. The sound reduction (when I could focus on anything other then the pain) wasn't hardly noticeable at all. Plus, the cord was just short enough that you can almost always be sure you're going to have your head jerked or your C.D player pulled into the floor when you move. These headphones have really turned me off from ever wanting to buy anything made by Philips ever again. It's sad because they actually sounded pretty good. But, who cares what they sound like if you can't even wear them because they're so uncomfortable!!??"
1,Terrible sound. Horrible design. Noise cancel is useless.,"I bought these to replace my Aiwa HP-CN5 headphones. The HP-CN5 isn't great but the Philips HN050 is flat-out terrible.The noise cancelation is really weak and adds a lot of hiss. It's like you're listening to an old cassette tape.The worse than the useless noise canceling is the design. There's an annoying behind-the-head band that means you can't put your head back on an airline seat or wear these headphones at the same time that you have a shirt with a collar on. And then there's this huge switchbox halfway down the cord which seriously gets in the way at the gym.If you're only paying $50 for a pair of headphones, you shouldn't expect too much but, even so, this thing is a total piece of cr@p. Ridiculously bad. Insanely horribly bad. The only way that these could be any worse was if they electrocuted you while you wear them or they caused brain damage or something. Truly awful."
1,Definitely needs some improvement...,"There isn't any way to adjust the neckband for better comfort. They will definitely slide off your ear if you put the back of your head against anything. There also isn't a means of adjusting the earpieces to fit them better to your ears. I am not real happy with the amount of buzzing/white noise in the background when I have them on. The noise gets even louder when you turn on the noise cancelling feature. The cord is also very short (3'9"") which has caused problems for me when I use them. It would also be better if the noise cancelling unit was higher up on the cord. Its about exactly half way between the earphones and the jack. There is a clip on it but I can't seem to find much use for it. It does reduce noise a little but I don't think it does that good of a job for the price. I'd definitely suggest getting a better fitting pair of earphones."
3,"not bad, could be better","I used these headphones on the bus and they do a decent job at reducing the noise level. You can't hear all the noise around you but if someone is sitting next to you talking you can still hear them. If the bus hit a bump or started to go fast the headphones started to break the music up, making the noise that headphones make when the cord is shot and not making a good connection. They are a little big on the head but the padding feels good against the ears. I own a pair of AIWA noice canceling headphones and although they are not as comfortable they do a better job at reducing the noise-level."
4,Good for what it's made for,"i must firstly mentioned that i previously had the EBC Redstuff on, so my review is coloured by it a bit...the pads work well,, with good initial bite moving into a firm grip when depressed further. the transition is natural, so there's no jerk in braking constantly/slowly.there is little difference between temperatures (though i am in the tropics, so my temp's 25-40 deg C), though there is a barely noticeable performance if pad is wetted prior to driving (e.g. washing the car).the brake force is good, though less than the Redstuff (obviously!). it works well for daily driving on all types of roads and styles. i've pushed them a bit and found they stood up to hard braking and such.one thing to note is that the Redstuff lasted significantly less than other pads i've used, due to it being a performance pad. i'm keeping an eye on the Greenstuff to see if it does as well.all in all, a good product that i'd recommend for daily driving of all types! :)"
3,"""If The CD That You Are Buying......""","......Has 7 Bonus Tracks and is on the FLAWED GEMS label, you are buying a BOOTLEG. F.Y.I.....(3 Stars for the ORIGINAL EDSEL/ISLAND Release)"
4,Rare giallo thriller. A must!,This long out of print Italian giallo film is finally being properly released on dvd!!! A must for giallo fans and their collection!!!!!!!!!!!
5,History!,As an afro-american a dvd pertaining to my history is always a plus. Well written and portrayed.
5,Sally Hemings: An American Scandal,"Sam Neill is excellent in this role. I love period dramas. Unfortunately, the children he fathered by Sally were never treated as equals. I certainly recommend."
2,Salvery is Slavery,"What difference does it makes if it was Thomas Jefferson or other slave owners who held high positions in this country, they all did the same,had children by these women who were held capture. Does this make it right to write a book as though it was some kind of regular love story. This Sally Hemmings more than likely thought that she was far superior than any other slaves on that plantation. Has any one wrote about how she may had felt about her own situation at that time, Thomas Jefferson was not the only President nor slave owner who have done this, PLEASE READERS, PLEASE, GET REAL. There so are many children conceived between slave women and their masters, there is no way to count them all, but genes do show up within families hundreds of years later. Gee,I wonder were did I get my very long, waist length hair, and my brother and my granddaughter, where did they get those hazel eyes???????"
3,Pia makes this movie good,If you like to see Pia Zadora - for whatever reason - this movie will be entertaining for you. It's what you expect of a Pia movie: good fun and a beautiful Pia. Of course you always have to take her movies with a grin - so you can enjoy them :) But I guess Pia knows that - otherwise she wouldn't have had her cameos in e.g. Hairspray. It's good Pia fun :)
5,Superb for children 6 months to 18months,"This book is perfect for children just learning to label the world. Ms. Oxenbury uses one word desciptions to label items involved with getting dressed. The graphic is merely a baby. Something a child can easily identify with! On the first page, for example, is the word diaper, with a diaper under it. On the facing page, a baby sits dressed only in a diaper. The book continues until the baby is dressed from the hat to the shoes. The illustrations are delightful - even to an adult!"
5,tasty crunch,I'm crazy for Ka-Me Crunch! Just love these little crackers--I can satisfy my craving for a salty snack w/o guilt. Love their thin-ness and the delightful flavor of sesame seeds w/just enough salt to satisfy my palate.Chloe's mom
1,The worst crackers ever,"I tried to order Sesmark rice crackers, but they were out so Amazon suggested me this brand instead, they are tasteless and terrible. I would not take them even if they are for free."
2,Hula Surprise,"Cute dashboard hula doll from Bell.The skirt is held on with some form of adhesive that loses its grip when heated, causing the skirt to fall off. Surprise!Who would have thought that the inside of a car would get hot sitting in the sun with the windows rolled up?Duh!"
5,"Fantastic value, includes CD-ROM of juggling videos","I ordered this because it was the lowest cost way to get some proper juggling balls. It turns out this product is a fantastic value.The balls are four color (red-green-blue-yellow), not red and black as shown in the photo. They feel great in your hands.The scarves were a bonus. We didn't know what to do with them, but the CD-ROM has a bunch of videos to show you what to do. This CD-ROM was the unexpected bonus-videos of lots of juggling techniques.Anyway, this is the best of the juggling ball packages on Amazon."
4,"Early ""drop in""method","utilized by Burroughs in his infamous novel, Naked Lunch, Break Through... is the audio version of the experimentaion done by Burroughs where he splices words and phrases to create entirely new ideas...great for those who are interested in the history of freakish pop culture and those who really like or are facinated by Burroughs!"
3,Tersano booster cartridges,"When I ordered my Tersanos Lotus Sanitizer (which works wonderfully well), I added a set of four booster cartridges to the order.However by the time I began to think about replacing the cartridge that came with the sanitizer, I found that the Miami humidity had managed to seep through what seems like the very well sealed transparent individual cartridge package. Since the cartriges act as dehumidifiers for incoming air, I decided squeeze out the humidity from the crystals by placing the cartridge upside down in my microwave oven with a cup of ice a couple of inches away. I placed the cup of ice in order to avoid overly concentrating the microwaves on the cartridge while minimally raising the humidity in the oven.I run the microwave for around 15 or 20 seconds. Afterwards the cartridge is surprizingly warm and the window shows some change of color along with beads of sweat. It would be nicer if the freed humidity had more of an outlet."
1,This book is much too complicated for a beginner.,"I'm a 55 year old looking to learn hiking with compass and GPS device. My education is life and a college degree. This book is not one to read casually, yet must be read with total concentration and a large memory. The memory is to store an overwhelming amount of initials and abbreviations. I kept placing bookmarks on pages that I felt needed real concentration. After quite a few of them, I decided this book was too tough for me. So, unless you can find perfect quiet, be fresh and alert, and take plenty notes, you should look elsewhere for navagating instruction."
5,A Fascinating Album,"This is an incredible listen. Granted its got a minor sound issue but its such a rewarding performance, you just need to turn the volume knob up a bit to hear it well. This is not utterly compressed like other live records and there is a lot of dynamic range between the quiet and louder sections.Nina is almost under a spell on this one. Her storytelling is fascinating and this album contains some of her most astonishing live cuts of all her live albums. Who Knows Where The Time Goes, Westwind, The Assisgnment sequence.Maybe not the album to start your Nina journey with, but if you want one of her most compelling RCA titles, and one of her most compelling live albums, this is the one to get when you're exploring that part of her catalog."
5,AMAZING cd...,"This is one of the best works of pure music I have bought in awhile. Not very often do you buy something where the artist really tried to make a statement with the music, but here, they do. For KWS and company to just go out, find the ROOTS of the music we listen to today, and make music on the spot with them is just amazing. Too bad they didnt bring more film to document even more than they already did. I could watch that footage for days. Everything here is beyond top notch. Very insightful, provides a glimpse of where the music came from and where it is going. If your a fan of ANY kind of blues, southern, or just guitar led music...you will love this."
5,10 days out,"This offering from KWS is one of the best CD/DVD combos' I've ever seen/heard. It's a ""must have"" for any real blues enthusiast. If you are a real fan of the blues your collection is not complete without it. It's a must see for the true historian.Also check out anything by Chris Cain. He is the man."
4,Great book to learn about going above and beyond,"For those of seeking to find out how we become better individuals, this book will help you! It was an easy read, with tons of quotes that make it fun to read. I went to a seminar and it was suggested that we purchase this, and I'm glad I did. (Plus I saved a TON of money buying it online)."
2,Good Pedal But Does Not Last,"I got a set of Mallets for X-mas last year and I've put over 2300 commute miles on them. The tension spring slides on the spindle (main shaft) of the pedal and hits the body of the pedal not allowing the wings to engage anymore. I took these pedals off yesterday and put a 7 year old pair of SPD pedals on. SPDs still work!I will not buy anymore Crank Brothers pedals. Also, I went through fours sets of cleats. Still have the original SPD cleats and they work perfectly."
4,Answers to questions about existence.,"If you have ever looked for answers to the most profound questions for our existence, read this book. The authors provide logical, easily understood reasons, enhanced by cartoons, for why the universe was created. Their theory of the evolution of the ego, which controls all of us, proves itself every day - most recently in the savage beating of a gay college student in Wyoming."
2,Over Rated!,"This book got such glowing reviews that I had to purchase it. A high standard was set by these reviews, and unfortunately, I was disappointed. Another reviewer mentioned that they couldn't get past the ""Zen stuff"", and I agree. There were sections that were so detailed on historical Zen philosophy that I had to skip the chapter before falling asleep. Maybe I'm looking for more ""action"", but I can tell you this book was a big disappointment."
2,He Left His Pleading Child Behind,He tries to ennoble himself with spiritual crap while taking on a load of bad karma by leaving his son behind begging for him to stay. Deeds not words.
2,"Without Gary Wright, There is No Spooky Tooth!","This album tanks! Mike & Gary sharing vocals WAS Spooky Tooth. When Gary left, Spooky died, same with Mike being gone on ""The Mirror"" That was the beginning of the end. Even now, Spooky isn't Spooky until ALL players come home."
1,tedious at best,"This book should be admired for its innovative use of the epistolary format, however it is an extremely tedious read. Its main goal is to convince the reader that the main character is rewarded in the end of the novel for her adherence to her virtue, but she's so boring and unlikable that you really don't care what happens to her. Richardson's novel is repetitive and unecisarily long, this novel could have been one hundred pages at the longest. For a more interesting read check out Fanny Burney's book Evelina, with its similar theme but much better execution."
3,Not current,"Maybe a minor classic in its own right, but aside from a few memorable sax themes there is not much to elevate this posting-bop past a genre time-stamp."
3,Tresor,When I smelled this one it smelled a little diffently than I rembered.I do like it and it shipped as stated just a little bit on the strong side.I wear it every now and then but wished I would have found somthing a little more subtle.
2,"Unfortunately, breaks easily","Sled looks great, appears solid. Unfortunately, when I tried to kick off the snow (in the middle of the sled), my foot went right through it. I am not the Incredible Hulk...the sled, unfortunately, is a bit brittle and shattered with limited impact."
2,Won't last as long as you think,Since the product is made for working out I used it almost daily. After about 9 months of use I took it off only to rip the plastic casing along the bottom of the band.It was a hassle to take the band off the casing so I never did. The band seemed large to begin with and slowly became out of shape.It looks cheap and from my experience it is.
4,Not as good as...,"Although inspired at places, this album suffers from the sort of inconsistency you'd expect when a solo performer assembles a different group of sidemen on each track. Sometimes, it works and sometimes it just doesn't. If you like Capaldi's work with Traffic, this will fail to satisfy. On the other hand, ""Oh, How We Danced"" is a real gem, and if you need some Capaldi, I suggest you go there."
3,Mystery indeed,"This book should be undertaken as a study--it is not a light read.Too difficult to understand for me, sorry. Nothing practical in it, only theory."
4,I little bit of Rao's outside hell's kitchen,"I have eaten at rao's in Vegas about 5 times now, and I'm thrilled to report everything I've tried to recreate from this book is spot on. To reply to other posts, simply salt and peppering meats IS the way to season meat. Fresh tomatoes and herbs simmered WILL give flavor. Patience and heart is what you need for Italian cooking."
4,more than a cookbook,"Wonderful, easy recipes as used in the great restaurant. A history of same is included which makes for enjoyable reading. Book arrived in perfect condition."
5,Kenneth Brannaugh's version is delicious!,"I usually don't listened to abridged books, but Brannaugh's rendition was so scrumptious, I listened to this twice. He is brisk in places and languid in others, and confirms my belief that audio cassettes are 40% author and 60% reader. A great rendition by a great interpreter.Pepys would be happy."
5,An outstanding classic which comes to life in audio cd format,"Samuel Pepys' Pepys' Diary is an outstanding classic which comes to life in audio cd format, narrated by Kenneth Branagh whose background in film and direction lend to a vivid narrative indeed. Pepys' classic has lasted centuries because it records in vivid descriptions the bygone world of 17th-century London life: this vivid written word in turn translates well into audio and brings a rich history to life."
5,True Talent,"Regina's talent and originality really shine through on this album. There are no low points, in my opinion. Every song is great, from the music to the lyrics to the vocals. I had heard Regina's singles and liked them, but wasn't sure if she'd be able to hold it up for a whole CD. I was completely proven wrong. A lot of these songs I like better than her singles. You won't regret making this purchase."
5,Commrades UNITE!!!,Let it be said from this day forward... and shall all like minded Commrades UNITE... Regina Spektor is the future of Music... Transplanted from Moscow to the Bronx she is here to deliver us from mediocrity... Her vox and sound and style are inherintly unique and devoid of comparison... She is quite simply the best and cute as a button to boot!!! Pick this up now!!! If you love music you will love Regina Spektor... Her music is like what it means to be alive!!!
5,positively iresistable,"i started listening to this album with no idea what i was in for and when i herd it all i wanted to do was smile. this feels so good to listen to, loved it"
1,LIKE BJORK WITHOUT THE TALENT,"If you take away Bjork's talent for writing some of the most inovative pop songs of our times. Take away Tori Amos sense of melody or musicality and you have Regina Spector. A whiny girl with nothing to say. I love all styles of music and have a record collection of over 20,000 and I would say this ranks as one of the worst. Truly abismal. Like Pe said DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,not enough info,"I wish more info, or a rating, had been given this music CD. I threw it in the garbage after receiving it due to the vulgar language. I would not listen to it in the presence of my two young sons, nor do I enjoy hearing that kind of language myself."
3,Good one but not the best,"We all know how great Regina is. However this is not my favorite cd. Her style has always been weird but the songs are not that great in my opinion... at least not like Aprés moi, on the radio, Samson, and all others included in the same cd, those are really really great. Anyway it's a most for anyone regarding himself as a fan, so I'm keeping it."
2,Easy to Use for the Basics,"I am a first-time user and purchased #8. I found it to be easy to use and understand, and the ability to print out nice looking family trees is great. However of the 35 CDs that came with the #8 Deluxe package, I found one useful and the others excess baggage. If you get the cheapest version of FTM, you'll get your money's worth. Any more and you'll have a lot of spare CDs to use as drink coasters for your hot chocolate. The strengths of the program are it's ease of use, the ability to include photos and ""scrapbook"" info, and to print attractive trees. The weaknesses of the program are the misleading advertising that makes you think you can use it for researching and the frustrating ""buy, buy, buy"" pitch at every turn. I would recommend FTM, but mainly as a good basic database."
3,Skip the data,"Wouldn't it be nice if Amazon would sell the ""program only"" option on this product (which is available elsewhere)? I concur with several other reviewers that the data CD's are useless for most users.The program is good, and the program is available without the data CD's and the membership for a lot less. I generally find that people into geneology are willing to share their data at no charge, and kinda expect others to do the same."
1,Stay away from Broderbund software,"I wish I could give them zero stars.Broderbund pulled support for software I owned only 2 years after it was released.I was unable to install it because it required internet registration which was no longer supported. To solve the problem, they offered to SELL me a different software title.They must have thought I was stupid. They expected me to give them more money???This company has second rate software and third rate customer service. Do not buy anything from them."
5,Brava! by Sally Harmon,"I played this quietly while my calculus students were working. Gradually, each one stopped doing math because they were so intent on listening. Finally, one asked, ""What is this beautiful music?"" It's my favorite soul lifting CD!!!! It includes the heart-wrenching melodies from Les Miserable ""I Dreamed a Dream"" and ""Come to Me,"" and from Phantom of the Opera"" ""All I Ask of You,""'Angel of Music,"" and ""Music of the Night."""
2,Not entirely worth your twenty...,"I have an apple ipod, and the little earbuds that came with them broke so I set off to find a pair at Target. However, they do not carry the original buds in stores, and my Target was out of the in the ear-bud ipod headphones. So I decided to try these. I wasn't very pleased. Their sound seems very distant and doesn't block out activity around me. Also, they don't have good volume. I liked the bass, but I just felt it sounded like I was in a large room and the music sounded distant. Overall, I would spend the extra 20 for the apple in the ear-bud headphones."
2,Wish I'd read the reviews first...,"Grabbed these to replace my iPod earbuds since they were cheaper and were supposed to sound good.They do sound very good, and the technology for what Phillips is trying to do is a great innovation for earbuds.The problem is that they won't stay in your ear, at all, and I suspect that about 95% of the people that try them will have the same issue. The poor design makes any other plus these earbuds have completely irrelevant; for exercise they'd be impossible to use, and they're only usable for sitting and using after frustratingly adjusting them constantly for the entire time you have them in.If you have a pair to try and they fit without falling out, they're great. For most people, though, there are far better options out there."
3,Bad Fit Decent Sound,"Good earphones but did the well paid engineers at phillips make them too big to many ears. I have to push them into my ear with pressure, not like other earbuds."
1,Who did they make these for?,They barely want to stay in your ears with either of the rubber pieces included. Feel like jogging? Not with these! I don't know who they made these things for but its someone with abnormal ears. They don't stay in hardly at all. Sound is fairly good but what good is that if you can't keep them in. A bad purchase.
1,Earbuds,"These earbuds are really not as great as they look. Please, please, please don't waste your money on them. I bought a pair and they hurt like no other! I am not one of those people that just hates earbuds alltogether. I prefer earbuds and find them comfortable. However, these earbuds hurt to wear and the sound does not even nearly make up for the pain. Also, they don't stay put very well and the rubber ear piece tears very easily."
3,Not for small ears,"I've had these for a number of years, but I was never happy with them because no matter how I tried to fit them in my ears, they keep falling out, and after a while, my ear canals just start hurting. The metal part of the bud is designed to go in your ear, unless other buds where basically only the rubber goes in, so if you have small ear openings like me, you're out of luck. The reason these get 3 stars is that despite all that, I have never heard better sound from a pair of earbuds. These truly have a full, booming sound. Which of course, bums me out that I can't wear them comfortably. I still wear them, but I must remove them every once in a while. If you have average ear openings (I guess I'm below average) then these are the best sounding earbuds you'll find at this price."
1,Whatever,"Nothing but cotton-candy mind-control. So suicides go straight to ""hell"", huh? What a cruel, insenstive LIE to dump on the loved ones and family members of suicide victims. I got news for you, there IS no ""hell"", it is all just a big scare-tactic made up thousands of years ago to keep people in line, to make them behave. So have fun believeing in your mean magical devil. It ain't true."
1,Wrong Harness for JBL Toyota Stereos,Do not buy this harness if you have a Toyota Tacoma with a JBL stereo. There is a built-in amp. in the current system that requires a much larger harness to hook up an aftermarket stereo. The harness you will need will cost about $75-$100. Hope my error is helpful for someone else.
1,never received item,never received item took 3 weeks for a refund total time of transaction 31 days...company ace photo has a sketchy track record with mailing items check reviews..
4,werry hrd to stick does not stick,but overall does great when u get it to stick does not move all that great could be pilled off by a scraper
2,Definitely not up to snuff,"Diana Gabaldon really drops the ball with this one. Fans of her Outlander series featuring Jamie and Claire will really be disappointed. The plot is confusing and pointless - as are her characters. Dialogue is good, as is her sense of the time period. But it's a short, unsuccessful attempt at a mystery novel. It seems it may have only been written to interest her readers before her next major Jamie and Claire novel comes out. Better to pass !"
4,A very entertaining view of 18th-century London,"I love all the Jamie & Claire books and wouldn't trade them for anything -- but I think Gabaldon has created a very nice period detective story here, much in the vein of Bruce Alexander's Sir John Fielding mysteries. (In fact, Sir John is alluded to, though not met, in ""Lord John and the Private Matter."") There's a real sense of being behind the scenes in 18th-century London, from the bawdy-houses to the mansions of the wealthy, enlivened by Gabaldon's grasp of arcane matters -- such as potentially deadly ""cures"" for syphilis. Don't expect swooning romance, but if you like historical mysteries, this one is very well done."
2,Mediocre Historical Mystery,"I expected something more from than a bland (at best) mystery novel. Diana Gabaldon is a favorite of mine, and since I'm also a mystery fan I was thrilled that she was releasing a mystery. However, upon reading, this seems like a side project that she didn't devote her full attention to. The story is missing the passion and vivid characterization of her other books. The plot points moved along slowly, and while I do like Lord John, I found the majority of the characters confusing and bland. I didn't care what happened to any of them, really. There are much better mystery novels around, if you need a Diana Gabaldon fix I'd reread Outlander instead."
2,Disappointed,"I eagerly devoured the Outlander series and consider Diana Gabaldon a writer who writes an enthralling, well researched book. This is well researched, but there is not really a plot with characters the reader gets to know. It became a chore to read about halfway through."
2,Why Lord John?,"I have enjoyed the Oulander series immensely and anxiously awaited the newest Diana Gabaldon book. As I read the Lord John book I kept wondering what it was that I missed about this character previously. Unless my memory fails me, Lord John raped both Jamie and Claire. I find it hard to understand how other reviewers find this character likeable or appealing. The historical aspects were, as always in Gabaldon books, interesting and engaging. I would have found the book more enjoyable had Ms. Gabaldon chosen a new character for this book."
1,Lord John and the Private Matter,"Being a big Diana Gabaldon fan, having read the Outlander series, some of the book twice, Lord John and the Private Matters was a total waste of time and money. I liked Lord John Gray in the other books but he was as unnecessary to the plot (but I give the book too much credit by suggesting that there actually was a plot) in Private Matters as the rest of the charcters, and I doubt anyone reading the story felt the least pang of regret that the two murder victims no longer inhabitated their world."
3,Lord John and the Private Matter,"This book was really a disappointment. I thought it would be more like the series of the Outlander. This was about Lord John and the lifestyles the folks who were ""cross dressers"" and homesexuals in that period of time lived. I really don't care one way or the other about this topic.CCL."
4,Good book,"I have read all of the Outlander series and am eagerly awaiting the next book. Meanwhile, I thought I'd assuage some of my need by reading the Lord John series. So far, I'd rate Lord John and The Private Matter as ""good"" but not as good as the Outlander series."
5,Fun romp!,"I'm a big Outlander fan and since we have to wait so long between books, I read the whole Lord John series. Was not disappointed at all. Full of history, interesting items of the 1700's, and surprises about the gay scene of the time. This is a quick read and Diana Gabaldon does not disappoint!"
2,I really like this book ....,"Like other readers that have written reviews for this book, I really wanted to like this book.... I couldn't agree more, that this was a short story that got away from the author.I have read the whole Outlander series many, many times and am still completely inlove with all of them, but this was not of the same quality.I was drawn to turn every page, staying up until 4 in the morning lost in the Outlander books, becoming almost obsessed. But this book didn't have any of that magic.Diana Gabaldon is a very talented author, nevertheless. I will ready any and every book she puts on the market, but not every one will make it into my personal library."
1,Save your money,"What a disappointment.I am a huge fan of the original series and found this book to be a waste of time and money. Hopefully, Diane Gabaldon's future books will be closer in quality to her trilogy. I am giving her one more try."
3,highly readable,"I am reading the Lord John books while waiting for the next Outlander.The one after ""abosaa"".I love Gabaldons work and must say that I have been more than completely engrossed with the Outlander novels, having read all six twice!!so I thought I'd give these a whirl.The novel was readable I enjoyed it.It did'nt WOW me though. I think that they lack the rich detail that her work contains that sucks you in and puts you there. I'm waiting for the second book to come we'll see what that one brings aye?"
3,Magnetic Shower Curtain,"My mom just moved, and it was nice to find a hard-to-find color for her, as she wanted yellow. It arrived quickly, was the perfect size, and a great price. She has told me that she had one complaint. It is very thin, so the breeze caused by the water spraying is a problem with it flapping. She has a non-metal shower area, so the magnets don't work."
2,A good place to start,"Definitely a good place to start if you're looking for help on building your own dummy. It has a good foundation, but unfortunately, that's about it. The layout is pretty bad- the step will reference a picture that's about 3 pages over. Pictures are adequate (in number) and good quailty, but are B&W. The book's price is also on the high side. The last section was unique in that it illustrates how to build a 'human response' dummy- a dummy that has moving arms and life-like response. A solid 2.5 stars- a good foundation with detailed steps, but not much else. If you're looking for a beginner's guide to building book, pick this one up for reference. Supplement this book with free mook jong plans found on the internet. Don't have time to build your own dummy- check out www.mookjong.20m.com JG"
1,Not for Quality Construction Dummies,This manual is only for individuals that don't care about the quality of their wooden dummy construction. I really feel that people can do better than this - even without construction experience. Spend some time when making your dummy. Research the internet for dummy plans. There are quality plans out there. Trust me. You don't want to have a cheap dummy. Its something that you can have your entire life.
4,Great Tote!,"This is a wonderful tote! I love the color! It is a great size to carry papers and books, with outside pockets for water bottles."
4,A very entertaining and funny film...,"This was actually a movie I caught on cable half way through, and then I rented it. It was worth the rental fee! This is a story of three single women all hoping and wishing to be married before they are old and gray. Ileana Douglas is my fave in the movie, and the other women are charming too. a good cast, some interesting insights into marriage, relationships, and sex. Also, good writing! a very well rounded film, which was never released widely. catch it on video if you like romantic comedies with an attractive cast."
5,One Hell of a Read,"Going Vegan is one book that I will cherish and nobodys allowed to borrow or take out of my house! This book will change you life and the way we all take simple things for granted. After following Ms. Blairs book, I have to say that I dropped a consideral amount of weight and never felt better. And to know that your, in essence, saving an animal on top of that is enough to buy one for all your friends. And my skin never looked better. Linda Blair is on to something. And have you seen her lately? Going Vegan is worth looking into."
2,Some good movies but poor quality,"At the time of this review this product is $17.99.Considering the availability of some of these movies, I would say it is worth it. But as some have said here, the quality of both audio and video is bad.Most of the time it is not both with one movie.For instance, Viva Django, good picture-bad audio.Trinity and Bambino, bad picture-ok audio.But, if you want these for your collection, $17.99 is not a bad price for 10 movies."
1,Save Your Money,"First off this is a ten movie set,two are fairly watchable two are barely watchable and six are pathetic. I'm speaking in terms of the transfers only,the content is up to the individual. The transfer ofBlackie the Pirate is the best followed by Viva Django which has severe audio issues in that you have to turn the volume all the way up and it only plays out of one audio channel.Trinity goes East and Trinity and Bambino are so bad that only a true fan of this genre can watch.the others are like watching a dirty TV screen in the fog. Apparently no effort was made to clean these up so I say why bother relaeasing this."
3,Not very durable,I only used this a few times and the motor died on me . When it worked it worked well but not very durable - I have switched to using the kitchen aid attachment - more reliable.
3,Are You?,"Da su se We Are Scientists pojavili pre odlicnih The Bravery, solidnih Bloc Party, smrtno dosadnih Franz Ferdinand, imbecilnih The Killers, od mene bi dobili i vecu ocenu, ovako WAS zvuce kao kopija gore pomenutih bendova. Ustavri, moglo bi se reci da su WAS odgovor na Evropski Bloc Party, cak stavise i bolje i energicnije zvuce, ali nazalost pojavili su se sa zakasnjenjem.Da li We Are Scientists imaju buducnost? Sumnjam, ali trenutnu slavu da.Ako ste pristalica trendi muzike, i fan bar jednog od gore navedenog benda album With Love And Squalor je nesumnjivo za vas."
3,echo that no one can hear,"I liked it but it fell flat at the end.The first in the series were great but these last two tanked,sorry but thats what I think.Maybe more stories of when he was starting in the teams would work better,then come back to the series."
5,"""Wisdom in a Dice Toss""","Chancing Life-Wisdom in a Dice Toss gives the reader inspiration and hope every time it is read. Guided by the excitement of rolling the dice to determine the chapter you will read makes this random reading even more intriguing. Each time I read the ""designated"" chapter, I find that it hits home and opens my eyes to new and positive possibilities. I recommend this book for the cynic and the optimist - the ideas therein can only improve our lives and the lives of others. Besides...you only need to read two pages in a sitting!"
4,NEED HELP!!!,I loved the music on this movie and wanted to know if someone could tell me the name of the songs and the artists?
3,Cute Movie,"If you are a Patrick Dempsey fan, then this is a must see. You will fall in love with him. This is an enjoyable romantic movie about how love and fate cleverly bring two people together."
2,Why Not to Buy,"I bought this product to find out information about my family, but this isn't what it says it is. This product is for people that already know about their family not people trying to find out about their family. You get a lot of disk but any information on those you have to go to Geneology.com to get the information and then the free subscribtion that you get to Geneology.com you only have access to a few things but not what you need from the disk, that is extra if you want to use it. I haven't been able to find anything about my family or my husbands family from either of these programs. So if you are trying to find information about your family I would try a different program because this one doesn't help."
1,Terrible!,"I bought these speakers to go with my new iPod nano, and they worked OK for about 2 weeks, except that their sound isn't incredibly powerful. The static is now so deafening that I can't hear the music!! What a waste...I don't recommend these speakers at all. Save your money and buy something-anything!-else."
5,Looking for the next new thing,I have owned this book since the early eighties. My copy is a Dover reprint. I had a small greenhouse at the time. This was before the internet and easy searching. I tried germinating anything I could find. J.L. Hudson Seedsman had many hard to get seeds. There must be scads of other suppliers by now. This book was an excellent starting place in my perpetual hunt for the new and different. Epimediums and Fritillarias I already knew about. This book has much much more.
5,O-Town ROCKS,"How can you not like this great music. They worked hard on this new album. They wrote half the songs.Even though they pushed the album back many times, they were makeing the album even better. This record ROCKS! Keep the O-Love goingO-Towns #1 FanJessica Bugner"
5,Wrist ache and ball control,This is the support needed for people with small or weak wrists. Helps releive the pain and give more ball control.
1,Cheap and NOT STURDY!,"After purchasing this product, I flew it once and it crashed and snapped in half. The body of the plane is Styrofoam. It just seemed really cheap and the description of the plane is misleading."
4,Dark Watch,I found Dark watch to be a terific read with great suspense action and drama. Well worth the time to read.
2,Not good,The book arrived in poor condition. The pages were discolored & separated from the binding. Very dissatisfied with the condition of this book. Not as advertised.
1,Stupid novel.,"I was reading Isak Dinesen(Karen Blixen), then switched to Dark Watch, read about 60 pages and it seemed a waste of time for me. Could not go on reading it anymore. Now I'll get back to the exquisite short stories of Karen Blixen."
2,Wrong Facts .. again,Good yarn as Clive Cussler goes but it appears somebody didn't check the facts....again. SIKH is a race AND a religion which does not relate to Islam. No Sikh would call his son Mohammed nor in his last minute on earth call out to Allah. I enjoy the reads but get annoyed with the wrong information. Call it nit picking but I expect more from Mr Cussler and am irked by these minor mistakes found in Dark Watch as well as Sacred Stone.
4,Evil Intents/ Thank goodness it isn't true,"Scary Cussler has a way of creating the nastiest and most devious characters. Cabrillo and the gang, as usual just happen to be in the right place and the right time. I love their Magic Shop.Thank goodness, they catch the mad man before it's catastrophicCheck it out"
4,easy reader,Little Bear find a picture of a young bear in the phot album. He is surprised to find out that it's him as a young cub! Little Bear and his friends decide that they want their picture taken so that they can look back at it when they grow up. Mother Bear sets to work and gets everything all ready for their picture. A great time is had by all!The book is a good story for early readers. The vocabulary is just right for those learning to read.I would recommend this book to others. Fans of the Little Bear show on Nick Jr. will enjoy reading about their favorite characters. Even my sister (21 months) enjoyed hearing this book. She turned the pages herself and pretended to read it.
2,better to make your own,"I'm a fan of old school editions of Latin texts, especially when they're out of copyright and I can assign them to my classes without bankrupting my students. This edition, however, is very dodgy. I knew it was just going to be a scan of an older edition, but it includes underlining and marks on some of the pages, and my copy, at least, skips from p. 43 to p. 83, thus eliminating most of De Clementia and several letters. It does include the commentary for these texts, so ... Also, the pages being considerably larger than the original edition, the text has been enlarged accordingly, a large-print edition, so to speak. Instead of buying this edition, it is much more worth your while (and just as legal) to simply xerox a library copy and ask a copyshop to bind it up nicely for you."
4,Introduction to a world yet unvisited by today's hip hop,"Mike Control is a great underground hip hop group, and another example of how if an MC has talent underground, he can spit what he wants and get the same respect no matter what race he is, unlike in mainstream rap where it is so uncommon and unnatural to see a white rapper. Enough of my critisism, let's get to praise. The verses written by the hip hop duo are cold and raw, and when they get on the mic, they don't hold back-they speak with intensity that isn't too common in rap these days, whether its mainstream OR underground. Mike Control is also very well-produced, serving raw beats to match the style and flow of the hard-hitting MCs rapping to them. I would give this a 5-star rating, but I have not yet heard all of the album. But from what I've heard so far, a 5 star rating wouldn't even be enough. Crazy sh*t."
3,Average,"I agree with the previous review that ophthalmologists should always be aware of the ocular manifestations of many systemic diseases...but, this book is more of a book of lists and pictures rather than containing much in the way of details on the diseases/conditions/associations it presents.It is almost like the Roy book, Ocular Differential Diagnosis except it has pictures of clinical findings. The benefit of the book is the great pictures though and the way the book is organized. You can look things up by clinical finding or by disease. It is a fast read, but probably worth the money if you can find it cheap.There are no details on diagnostic testing, disease course, or treatment. Its just not that kind of book"
4,Courageous Memoir,"In Ms. Kraus' Memoir, she crafts a particularly well written recount of a personal experience that to most of us seems like a total nightmare. And in addition, she is courageous in her presentation. Not many have the courage to write for the world, that they were basically a somewhat bipolar individual with a huge identity crisis, but in fact, that is what Ms. Kraus has done.With great aplomb, she depicts the essence of her relationship with her main character, and how it gave her both intense pleasure and the greatest of sorrows, the deepest of despairs. And in addition, brought Caroline to the very brink of total self-destruction.But I do believe, that the book illustrates she has found the basic truth in Nietche's statement, ""What Does Not Destroy Me Makes Me Stronger."" The book is truly inspirational for all people in very difficult relationships, and allows the reader to deeply introspect, to understand Ms. Kraus' deep and emotional story."
3,"Compelling, suspenseful read","This book was a page turner. Kraus so clearly stacks the deck against Jane from the beginning that one reads the book with a constant sense of dread and foreboding. Although that added to the suspensefullness of the book, I felt that it detracted from the complexity of the relationship. I only wish that Kraus had been able to articulate Jane's loveliness as well as she articulated her dark side. The fact that Jane possessed both qualities is what makes her such an interesting character. For the flip side of a very similar relationship, I highly recommend Truth and Beauty by Ann Patchett."
1,Poor quality,"The camera requires an unusual battery that isn't included. So I went to Radio Shack to get the battery. The camera powered up. I inserted a 2GB SD memory card. The screen showed an error message ""ECO"" that wasn't in the manual. I called Bushnell and they said it can't handle bigger than a 1GB memory card. That isn't in the manual. I tried to remove the memory card but it wouldn't come out. I tried harder, got it out, and now the camera won't power up.Other complaints: the SD memory card slot isn't covered so rain or sand could get into it. The binoculars are OK but have the black shadows of a narrow exit pupil size. This is as bad as 10x20 binoculars, even though the 8x30 binoculars should have an exit pupil twice the diameter of a 10x20!"
2,Mostly vague sentences.,This movie was just preaching to the chorus. When they made vague of contraversial statements they should have tried to back them up with more information. I gave it one extra star than I had to becasue it did have a few words of wisdom. There is a part in the movie where they talk about 9/11. Not everyone agrees about why 9/11 happend so it was pointless and in bad taste to me. I don't know what the point of the movie was.
3,Good alternative music mix,"Having been out of the Christian hard rock/alternative music scene for several years this album brought me up to speed with today's bands. I only wish there was more music like this when I was in high school...I had to settle for Stryper, Bloodgood and Whitecross."
5,Pure gold,All of Krishnamurti's teachings are pure gold and through this book one is invited to meditate along with him as with all of his teachings.
3,Won't work with Westinghouse TX-42F430S,"I bought the Westinghouse TX-42F430S 1080p television and this HD-DVD unit. But, the two hate each other and I could not get any video. This is also well documented in the AVS forums. I don't know which to blame. Probably the TV. But I wanted to warn everyone."
5,TOSHIBA Delivers,"I would say that Toshiba has really delivered on this product. I have also already downloaded firmware upgrade for it from Toshiba's web site. At the moment I am watching it on a 37"" RCA 720p/1080i widescreen HDTV and it looks fantastic with my regular DVD's. I have only 1 title at this time on HD DVD and it looks fantastc, no black bars above or below the widescreen. I have a Toshiba 57"" DLP Full HDTV 1080p on order and can hardly wait to see what kind of detail I get from it."
1,Obsolete...,"I have returned the Toshiba HD-A20 DVD player. I purchased this for my husband for Christmas, and had no clue that the high definitions were obsolete. Movies are coming out in Blu-Ray, but this product does not play Blu-Ray movies. Blu-Ray players will play movies in high definition, but movies are not being produced in ""high definition"". They may have a high definition feature and the new DVDs of today will upgrade to what they are to be seen as, but Blu-Ray is the way of the future. I had no clue when I ordered this, and later found out that it was no longer being made. No wonder it was such a great deal. I did have to pay shipping to return the item. I truly believe the sellers who sell through Amazon should notify their customers of the facts. Otherwise, the product did come promptly, and Tech for Less was very nice about the return. I have no problem with the seller other than the fact that it should be noted that this item is no longer being made and does not play Blu-Ray movies."
5,Worth the money.,"I know we don't know which format will win yet, Blue-Ray or H.D., but I couldn't wait. First, I think H.D. will win, but regardless, this DVD player is fantastic. We watched Planet Earth in HD the first night we hooked it up, and could not believe the color and details!! The merchant shipped quickly, the price was great, and you will not be disappointed if you buy this!!"
5,Love MY HD DVD,This machine is awesome--make sure to use the hdmi cable you have to purchase seperately but worth it for picture and sound. Great price
3,OK. Must have for true fans else start elsewhere.,"I love all their albums except for Whites Off Earth Now and this wasn't that great. All other albums grew on me after repeated listenings. This, well, got a bit better but it wasn't that great. But hey, I'm a true fan so I have it."
2,A disappointing follow-up to Lay it Down...,"After buying their Lay it Down CD I was expecting more of the same great songs. Not only did the music seem half-hearted, some of the lyrics were rather offensive. If you're of the religious persuasion you may want to skip this offering."
1,garbage,"this is the most abhorrent piece of crap that has ever been filmed. never have i seen the amount of useless trash that i have in this film. it is filled with boring narration and literally NO violence and NO gore. After hearing everyone talk about this video I figured it'd be great. I rented this video thinking that i would be disturbed or scared. Instead, I ended up feeling empty... bored... and a little poorer... if you want to do your deed for society... STOP talking about this video... and for god sakes... don't rent it."
1,"Man, I was Scared...","that this movie would never end. This movie made me want to shoot myself in the face. Some of the dead bodies and stuff are real, but it's no more gruesome than that show about tornadoes I saw on Discovery the other night. Don't try to find another movie that's more realistic or w/ better death scenes, just save that money for Colt 45 and porn."
3,Boz,"I am happy with the product. Even though it was a used book, it was complete without any pages missing or significant damage."
2,I`m not even sure this made a differance...,"This may have helped a very little bit, but I was hoping to feel a big rduction in the pain. Dissapointing."
1,Not Backed by Whirlpool,Purchased two of these filters. The first lasted a little over one month. Just got off the phone with Whirlpool and they only have a warranty if you buy directly from them. They said they do not have a contract with Amazon. Now to contact Amazon.
3,No Complaints,Product seems to work just fine. I change it once a year and I do not have any water taste problems.
1,Lasted less than two months!,"It worked fine for a few weeks, but the water flow quickly slowed to a trickle. Lasted half as long as the Kenmore filters we usually buy. I expected better quality from Whirlpool."
4,Works well.,"I used this for my two chinchillas. It would last about 4 days to a week, depending on the water intake my chins had."
2,Will comfort those who already think that Spong is a nut.,"While one of the contributors to this volume accurately points out that the appeal Bp. Spong has to communicants, listenters, and readers is that he addresses the questions people are really asking, the writers in this collection largely miss the point and engage in mean-spiritied, ad hominem attacks without getting at the underlying issues. The former Bishop of South Carolina (Allison) is an exception and his critique is right on target without being viscious."
4,Worthy Reading,"Patricia Roy knows how to write good characters. Robert is a little on the young side for my taste, but his characterization was done so well I didn't mind. You could see why Meg would fall so in love with him. The story of how the two get to know each other and fall in love is a little hampered in the second half of the book with a bit too much action, but still I enjoyed this book very much."
2,Disappointed,"I read the great reviews for this product and chose it over other ground loop isolators. It did reduce all of the hum, but also cut out the mid-range frequencies. The vocals are barely audible!"
3,"Decent, but not great","Bought this to get rid of noises coming through the radio and whining whenever I pressed the accelerator after installing an fm modulator (by scosche) in my 02 accord. It got rid of the accelerator noises but there was still noticable crackling and it also distorted the treble at high volumes. Bought a PGLI35 from another site for $12 and it got rid of all the noise without the treble problems.In summary, it works, but it's not the best."
4,Works great on Mixtrack Pro/laptop setup,"This product works great when used to eliminate the speaker buzz caused by laptops. However, it does not work very well when used alone on my iDJ. However, if you're looking for something to get rid of that annoying buzzing sound caused by laptops, this will definitely do the trick."
3,Loud and Strange,"This was the best battery-powered air pump I could find and it works well for traveling, which is why I bought it. But it is very loud and moves almost violently. For some reason the one I have will only work with the battery power. The electric cord just won't work. Again, I'll stress how loud it is. I would only recommend it because of the price and it works for traveling in a car if you wrap it in towels to smother the noise."
2,Poorly executed approach,"Book might be good as a class text, but it is not at all suited for self-study. The SAS how to description is marginal at best. A better separation between SAS and SPSS description would have been helpful."
2,"OK reference, but don't expect detail","I think the problem with this book is that it is too broad. It covers virtually everything you can think of and a lot you probably didn't know existed. Unfortunately this wealth of knowledge is so diverse that it only covers the very surface of most topics. If you want to know what something is or get a very rough idea of how to do it, this book is helpfull, but it certainly won't improve your photography. It is quite elaborately illustrated and provides many black and white, and color examples. It needs to be updated as technology is advancing so rapidly. I would prefer much less information on tricks and special effects, and more practical information such as exposure tables for different films and conditions."
4,THE book to have,"I bought this book with many doubs but once i had it in my hands, i knew it was the right book to have when you're an amateur or a pro. I recomend it if you're looking for a book to learn a lot of things."
5,This is a true metal monster album!,The Ripper oroves right here why Priest nabbed him as a replacement for Halford. This is amazing picture vintage MEtallica or Megadeth or Iced Earth with Owens singing. TRUE POWER METAL!
4,The story of the nun and her album.,This film has Debbie Reynolds and her wonderful voice as Sister Ann - A true story - so following the creation of her songs from her personal experience as a nun working with the disadvantaged is interesting and her folk-style - ahead of it's time- during the early 1960's - is also interesting - - - It's all about the music. Chad Everett as the producer represents the temptations of the ego to make a humble gift into an world-wide phenomenae - - - She resists and escapes to Africa to live out her calling after one album - - - Some of the people don't understand and some do. A good family movie.
5,"My Review of ""The Singing Nun","One of the favored movies of my childhood and young adulthood. This movie combines faith,love,hope and the vows of poverty,obedience and charity with the lovely voice and talented acting skills of Debbie Reynolds. A young nun learns about fame and the sometimes high price of it that can take much from you, especially when one is a nun who is seeking daily,The Will of God.This movie version may not be the true story of the real singing nun,but then neither was ""The Sound of Music"" the real, ture honest story of the Von Trapp family. But then,such is the way of Hollywood,at least back then in the 60's. Sugar sold better that starch or vinager.If you're a stickler for the truth,avoid this movie like the plague. Otherwise,get it and have a great,wonderful,enjoyable time with it's lightheartedness,cheer and liveliness."
4,Great fun!,"This table is lots of fun, the roulette spinner needs some work, but other then that it is great fun at home and portable."
5,Small is more in this little masterpiece,"A Gibbons' classic, beautiful, upbeat, poignant.The sound of Southern women's voices talking, talking, talking comes through loud and clear, and you get the impression that the stories will keep coming long after you've finished this gem of a book."
4,Good book,"This Fighter's Guide is a pretty good source for all the noobies out there. If your sick of button mashing your way thru battles and jamming random buttons, this book is definately for you! It helped me defeat this Mexican dude who kept using Raphael's Queen's Guard and kept doing the same moves over and over again.Great book!!"
1,"An umimaginative, boring & difficult read!",Extremely difficult and unimaginative book. Not for casual reading. More fitting for a class room text book.
2,NOT WORTH IT,"I thought this book would have some beautiful needlepoint alphabets given there were 97 of them. However, most of the alphabets were very blocky, nothing graceful. I sent the book back, because it was not worth the $105 to keep it, not to mention a used book was mistakenly sent to me for this price rather than a new one."
2,Did not light up!,"I purchased this as a gift for my younger brother for Christmas. He opened it and was wildly excited because he's been wanting one for awhile. We were much dismayed then when we put the batteries in and the light did not work. We were able to determine, using some electrical equipment his grandfather had, that it was the lightbulb that was defective not the whole piece. However, we've now gone to three stores and have been unable to locate the correct bulb. We are trying one more store before returning the product. VERY inconvenient for something that should have worked from the start."
5,"Come, For the Feast is Spread","A warm invitation to experience the riches of Christianity. In a nation obsessed with getting more, Rienstra quietly asks the reader to consider whether more (stuff) isn't really less. Why settle for cotton candy, when Christ has prepared a rich banquet that isn't just vegetables, but dessert too."
2,small hoops,"In the description, it didnt say these were TINY AND NOT ABLE TO WEAR IN THE EAR LOBE!! very disappointed."
2,Not recommended,"I wasn't sure what to expect so I wasn't too let down, the actors and the movie itself are alright but a cute movie isn't my type."
4,Afirm face cream,"I have been using Afirm, starting with Afirm 1X and now using Afirm 3X. My skin appears smoother and clear. I plan to continue using it nightly."
1,Too basic,"I bought this dictionary for my mom, but she said the words are too basic. She started studying minimal English at the age of six and she has taken college courses. No one in my family has been in ESL. We are Chinese immigrants and this is still considered basic. The dictionary proved useless. We may donate the item in the future.If you are interested in purchasing this, I would not recommend it unless you have elementary school children or older immigrants on your hands. Otherwise, it's useless. All words can be found online, anyway. While it's true that it would be nice to have them all together in a single volume, this doesn't do the words any justice since most people who have studied an intermediate level of English would know almost all of them."
1,Don't buy this book,"This book is a waste of paper. The only worthwhile information is copied from other books, in diluted form! Most of the entries are so general to be of no value. Spend your money elsewhere, and save a tree."
3,Look instead for the revised and updated edition of this book!!,"Just this past year, a totally revised edition of this book was published by Square One Publishers as a trade paperback. In addition to the help that any update will provide, there are also several new line illustrations throughout that show the intricacies of body language. Lastly, this new edition of the book benefits greatly from the added input of second co-author Professor Gabriel Grayson - a body language expert and bestselling author of the sign language reference guide TALKING WITH YOUR HANDS, LISTENING WITH YOUR EYES. If you want the best and most up-to-date version of this material, then this is the book you want!"
1,In this case You get what you pay for! not even!,"I bought these about a year ago, when i was doing some high speed military training. People were pretty impressed with them for the most part. Until! one day i was pulling them out my assault pack and the cord peeled off the wire. It was all down hill from there. They dont stay in your ear unless you painfully jam them in there. You're constantly readjusting. Then finally one ear finally went out! Im not too upset cuz i only paid 15 bucks for them, but man. Now i am stuck looking for another pair, and stuck with my factory ipod buds which definately dont stay in and only sound loud.Dont buy em. Can someone point to a expensive pair that actually have good base and terrible?"
1,One cannot possibly make a decision so poor as buying these,"I have never felt as disconcerted over something as trivial as a pair of headphones as I do now. It would take great efforts and extensive study to find a pair equally poor as these. The slightest of movements will remove them from your ear. If one were to cough then his ears would be as bare as when he was without earbuds. They do not remain put either when one is sitting, standing or walking. I beseech you not to purchase this pair, I would not have anybody, no matter their faults, to feel even a moments exasperation of this sort of which I have felt much too long."
1,Ruined a good workout,"These are the worst headphones I have ever encountered. I would take the $5 kind that start to hurt your ears any day over these. The only way I could get them to stay in my ears was to stay still like a statue. I took them to work out and they kept falling out during my cardio. I looked like an idiot trying to stick them back in over and over until I finally gave up. I tried to talk to Philips about this problem and the guy told me that maybe I should have bought headphones that are designed for ""more active music listening"". Was he kidding? Shouldn't headphones be able to withstand 30 minutes on an eliptical? I wasn't on a trampoline or anything. From some of the other reviews, it seems like they will work for some people's ears, but not for everyone. Sadly, my husband and I both got a pair, so now we have double the disapointment. Steer clear of this set and get something that doen't have such mixed reviews."
2,"Great Sound, Bad Fit!!!","I purchased these thinking that like other Phillips products I have had I would be greatly satisfied. Well the sound is great, but the fit of the earpiece is awful! I have small ears, but aparently the size of your ear has nothing to do with it from the looks of the other reviews. Your ear does hurt after and during use. I would not recommend these headphones at all. Painful to use. If you can stand the pain the sound is good, but bad design. Maybe differnt sized caps would help. Hopefully this will prevent others from the same bad mistake I made!!"
4,Can't beat them for the price,For $20 you really can't beat these headphones. I had no problems with the fit. Much better than the headphones included with the iPod.
2,"nice design, but terrible sound","not a big fan of this headset. it'd be better to just not have the bass instead of this low quality peaking bass that's just annoying. the sounds wavers and get distorted on certain songs too, i don't know if my headphones are just busted or if this is the way it's supposed to sound."
5,perfect,I bought this ear buds today and i LOVE IT!! they fit perfectly into your ear and the surround sound feature is great.the only bad part is that the case the comes with it. u can't get the ear buds in good. I HIGHLY RECOMEND BUYING THESE!!!
1,Extremely uncomfortable,"I bought these to replace my Sony EX51s which had problems with the cord falling apart. I loved the Sony earphones, but the cord was very poor quality.The sound on these Philips earphones is pretty poor, but hey they cost under $20, so I didn't expect much. I did however expect that they'd fit in an average person's ear. They did not. I had to cram them in my ear. They're extremely uncomfortable and frequently slipping out of my ear. I've now ordered a pair of Shure e2c earphones due to great reviews."
1,Not the best out there,My one and only complaint is that they fall out. You can in now way force these giant things into your ear canal. They pop out and dont fit right. The sound was good the fit was not.
4,A very good intro to great writers,"I started this book with increasing reservations, wondering what this neophyte writer could say about the canon standards like Whitman and Thoreau and eventually decided: not much. But as the book progressed and Whitaker was on more contemporary turf, his comments became more insightful, more personal and more discerning. His thoughts on Jane Bowles, Glenway Wescott, Gore Vidal are very smart and reveals ideas buried within their work in a very convincing way. The writing is always lucid and even when not particularly brilliant, entertaining. Ultimately a very good place to start when approaching gay writing (or even, for that matter, a good place to end up)."
3,Inland Pro USB Converter USB to PS/2 review,"I want to qualify my 3 stars rating is based on my setup only . Your situation maybe different.I bought these to be used with a KVM switch. My computers do not have PS/2 ports. Only USB. After hooking up the converter from the computer to the KVM switch, the KVM switch stops functioning. My KVM switch simply is not compatible with the converters.The converters by themselves work. I don't know enough to say if the KVM or the converter is at fault. I would simply say they are not compatible.So, if you are looking to use the converter in a similar fashion as I, be aware of incompatiblity problems.Otherwise, the converter works fine."
3,Hit -or- Miss with COLOR selection - disappointment :(,"Originally, the picture displayed a TAN seat cover, but the color was not spelled out anywhere in the text. I took a chance and ordered the item, the outside of the box said GRAY....but the product received is actually OLIVE. Does Amazon just send out RANDOM COLORS? Could it be any more confusing? Additionally, where are the measurements? No time to return & try again."
1,Most Disgusting Flavor of Eclipse!!!,"I wish I new this tasted like Black Liquerish* (Spelling?) before I bought 24 packs of this flavor. Damn! By the way, 24 packs for $18 ($.75 Each) is actually not worth it. I noticed the price a 3-pack of eclipse at the supermarket costs $1.69 ($.56 Each). So it turns out I overpaid for crappy gum and I'm stuck with it."
5,Unreal precision,"This mouse pad provides unearthly precision. This is not like ANY other mouse pad, but somehow provides laser like mouse precision. Buy it!"
5,Awesome,"Thsi book was a perfect bookb for someone who wants to know the straight facts about Botany. For example, a college student might enjoy useing this book because it is packed with so much information."
4,Do you think you could handle this camp?,"This book is kind of confusing in the start but as you to read it makes more sence. This book is about two kids that have to go to fat camp, because their mom and dad said that you would be miserable if you stayed fat. You will have to read the rest to find out what happens to the kids!"
1,Very bad playback,The playback was disrupted and very poor. All other connections to other sites were fine. Very hard to watch thisWith such poor playback from Amazon.
1,TOTAL: RIPOFF!,I was sold a bootleg copy of this product. The product was listed as NEW in the description. The disc wax also CRACKED. This was a real disappointment on AMAZON because I found out that this guy has sold this same BOOTLEG 4 other times but Amazon is still letting him sell.VERY UNHAPPY.
1,Missing DVD,"I recieved the box set and it had two #3 dvd's in the set. I e-mailed them and they sent another box set. Guess what, two #3 dvd's again. Still waiting to hear if they got this problem straightend out."
3,Too Much Soap,"I agree that this seasons DVD set is entertaining as always, but I was dissapointed with the direction the season took. The episodes in the first two disks kept ending like some TV soap. The Sapranos went from being a story about a crime boss and his having to deal with his personal family as well as his Mafia family to him dealing with his personaly family and the Mafia family secondary. There's an overwhelming amout of series with soap themes all over the tube. I really hope this trend doesn't continue with this series.....Having said that though this DVD set is still a must for any Saprano's fan"
5,the real deal,a beautiful and thoughtful album that features the key players from David Bowie's band (one of its incarnations). Gaines brings a soulful edge and strong songwriting to this work. It has a folksy and bluesy sound that eschews the commercialism of other popular male black vocalists. Galore is substantial and authentic - very refreshing and lasting.
5,Amethyst,was the last in a series I needed and was very pleased with the condition of the book and the price.
3,Only a good read.,"The book did not flow as smoothly as it could have. It seemed hurried in places, but mainly the character Tessa really annoyed me. In this day and age, she just seemed too casual at jumping from bed to bed. Granted it does happen in real life, but in this book it just seemed too much for my liking."
4,Awesome & Odd,"This short record is songs about sex, BLING KONG (the band and character) and other bits of pop culture. Musically it draws from things dance, rock and pop like Judas Priest, Andrew W.K., B-52s and early glam. According to their site, Spin said, ""Bling Kong is ideal for those missing the days of freshly adolescent Mad Libs or disgruntled former cheerleaders looking to release years of pent-up sexual aggression."" That's about right."
4,Good Book,"Just a good book, good information and a good ref to have around if you are a writer in business or technical fields."
5,Excellent!,"Beautiful pictures, full and concise information about history, culture and landmarks, tons of day trip options from Prague, guided walks of the Old City and the Lesser Quarter in Prague, along with guided walks in Karlovy Vary and Olomouc in the Czech Republic, two driving tours, interesting articles... I'm surprised that National Geographic hasn't updated this guidebook like they've done with so many others."
3,not the right piece,i got this to install a double din (kenwood) reciever into an 08 mustang it didnt connect to the car but worked for the radio igave a low rating because of that
2,Byrd's best album . dissapointing sacd,"This release in a word ""pointless"". Being pleased with most mofi releases i was ecstatic to see Notorious Byrd Brothers was getting ""the treatment"". I was expecting THE DEFINITIVE digital version! but alas , upon an A/B listen with the columbia redbook stereo remaster. To my ears the redbook is superior sonically not to mention the intended stereo mix. I was really hoping to be blown away hearing one of my favorites on sacd. Stick with the six dollar standard reissue."
5,Shame On You!,"Here is a recording that should be on every one's desert island list. Recorded at a time when the Byrds and the Beatles were swapping recordings of each others upcomming releases. The Byrds hit first with this, the Beatles followed with Sgt Pepper. This epitomizes early fm radio at its finest. Check out McGuinn's guitar solo on ""Change Is Now"" or David Crosby's ""Dolphins Smile"". If you don't own this Shame On You!!!"
5,Funny reading the reviews...EITHER LOVE IT OR HATE IT,"I loved the book....was trying to analyze why I enjoyed it so much....It captured me from the very beginning, part of the appeal due to the familiarity of the setting and my interest in relationships, I suppose. It was so easy to envision the whole thing. enjoyed the entire chase, was fascinated by the emerging theories throughout. I have to admit, at times I was a tiny bit uncomfortable with some of the ideas she was suggesting, but in the end I was neither offended nor were any core beliefs altered! : ) Just a great ride, if you ask me!"
3,Tac Tic might work for some...,"Ostensibly a good idea, but, I have difficulty determining the exact point at which the ""click"" occurs during a normal-speed swing."
5,Kind of Compassionate for the Busy Vegan,"Being Vegan is a great book which is compassionate not just for everything extrinsically altruistic about Veganism, but intrinsically for Vegans themselves. If you are a busy person with little free time, or required reading of a study/work nature makes reading a book seem like a chore rather than a pleasure, then Being Vegan is the book for you. This is a book compassionate towards Vegans themselves by providing a readable style with a punchy article-like question and answer format of FAQs cutting to the essence of what it is to be Vegan. The content is balanced, so taking away the information to intergrate into every day is realistic. Congratulations Joanne Stepaniak for providing a book that is compassionate to everything, including busy Vegans. A consistent author whose skill of her craft can allow the context mirror the content of a work."
5,Kingston VauleRam memory,"This item was even better than advertised. It had a lifetime warranty which I did not expect. It was easy to install, qualified for free shipping and was recieved in the 5 days specified."
4,Decent,"Prior to entering the police academy I needed to know my blood type. To expedite the results I ordered this kit. After using the automatic lancet, more than enough blood came pouring out of my finger. I was able to get the blood in the stir sticks by wedging them in my computer keyboard which gave me a free hand to squeeze a drop on each stick. Overall this is a decent product but I only rated 4 stars because the results were not as clear as I expected leaving me with some doubt. One more helpful tip, watch the eldoncard video on youtube, it does a walkthrough on the entire process making it a little easier to understand than the written directions."
1,Find another kit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My review of the kit as simple as possible.1. Ordered the 4th it came the 9th.Which is good since it was ups, but it did take about 3 days to be mailed out.2. Kit came. I watched the video, read the directions over and over again.3. The Lancet is a joke. Only one use and it doesn't produce enough blood.I had to run down to rite aid and buy lancets WITHOUT the device for additional 5.99.I must've spent an additional hour pricking four fingers for enough blood to take the test.4. Don't waste your money."
2,blood type test kit,I choose it because it looked like the rest of the test offered. I have not tried to use it because it seems extremely complicated and intimidating. I would recommend it to a medical professional. My blood does not flow easily and to try and get my finger to bleed for a few minutes is impossible.
5,Tons of Space at Little Cost,"It is amazing how much can be stored on a 4gb flash drive! This is a good, solid tool for backups, storage, and tons of tunes.Good drive, great price."
4,Awesome,"I loved this book. I connected with all the different characters, they were just like kids at my own high school. This is a must read for any teen, and even any parent of a teen. It seemed so true. Almost as if the author wrote it from being a student at my school."
4,Top Notch Hagberg,This was a most enjoyable read. Lot's of quick paced excitement. Four man CIA team on a mission to get information on a nuclear test end up being captured by Pakistani's. Navy Seal team attempts to rescue them. US submarine Seawolf has much excitement as it prevails over North Korean and Chinese craft. The only thing missing was the capture of the enemy spy who was highly placed in the U.S. government and kept tipping them off to the above mentioned plans.
4,Mystery and Science Fiction-Great Combination,"I really enjoyed this book. The characters were varied, the plot intriguing and the writing was clear and literate."
3,Francis Massacre rocks!,"Frankly, I find this record kind of boring, but it picks up towards the end. Keith Levene seems to be absent from this record. Instead it is dominated by drums, and John Lydon's pseudoEgyptian chants. But ""Francis Massacre"" is as menacing as anything he's ever done, including Sex Pistols' material."
3,fun to play but something's missing...,I love to play piano and I was thrilled to get Tori's book of sheet music. However I was disappointed to see that a lot of the piano music had been modified from her original work. Many arrangements of popular music tend to incorporate the vocals and other instruments into the piano piece (in order to hear the melody or another aspect of the song) and this is the case with these arrangements too. Although sometimes I agree that doing this may make the piece sound better when played alone (without vocals or other instruments) I wish they would have note-for-note what is actually in the original version of Tori's songs.
4,Criss takes off on strong set from 1967,"This set is notable for the presence of guitarist Tal Farlow. The highlight is the sax-guitar trade-offs on Charlie Parker's ""Scrapple from the Apple"". Strong solos throughout from Criss uplift the more pedestrian material. Pianist Cedar Walton, bassist Bob Cranshaw, and drummer Lenny McBrowne provide solid support."
5,simply beautiful,"I was introduced to this CD by a dear friend of mine. I loved it instantly. Beautiful melodies, and not the typical new age, mindless music I expected. When my dad died, I chose this CD to play during the viewing. No, I don't mean to be morbid, I just want to say it felt very good to feel I contributed in such a beautiful way. Certainly this CD is good for more than funerals, though it does seem to lend itself well to them. I guess the bottom line is this.... Danny Wright's Phantasys is a heavenly work, and anyone with an appreciation for original piano compositions will enjoy it for years to come"
2,Not very good,"I'm sure my disappointment with Easy Prey has to do with style. I love to follow the villain throughout the book, learning about his life and what makes him/her tick. And nobody does it better than Sandford. The ""whodunit"" style of Easy Prey made for a boring read. The person who did the murders really came out of left field. Sandford tried to make it interesting with Davenport's female juggling, but it didn't work. Hopefully, he will go back to his regular style because he creates great people."
4,"Wonderful Writing, Tough Topic","John Sandford writes a good book and tells a good story. This book ranked lower on my ""likability"" scale because of the subject matter. He treated these subjects fairly (drugs, models, etc.), they're just not as appealing--at least to this reader--as the plot events/situations/characters in his other books. I'm looking forward to the next Lucas Davenport novel--and hoping the author returns to type of plotting he did in his earlier works. Those fascinated."
2,A Huge Disappointment,"I love the Prey series (at least the first ten books), but this one was severely lacking. Sandford just seemed to slap too much onto the pages - too many characters, too many subplots, too many themes.....and too little action! This was a blip I'm sure - I'm on to #12 in the series after typing this review!! This is one you can skip."
3,Easy Prey,"Was not one that was gripping or held my attention well enough to not put down, Was good, but not great."
2,Not even close to other Prey books!,"I've read all of John Sandfords books with special interest in the Prey series. This book felt like someone else wrote it. No suspense from beginning to end. Usually I can't put his books down, this time I wasn't excited about picking it up. Wasn't really sure what we were chasing at moments, not his normal suspense and terror. Even Davenport's affairs were lack-luster. I actually bought this one before release from Amazon. Next time I'll wait for the firesale to see if John is back on track. Barely 2.5 stars. I'll have to read the old Prey books while we await for the new release."
1,Very disappointed,I agree with Katherine Hill. She said it all. I haven't convinced myself to even read the last 50 pages.
1,'Prey' for it to end,"'Prey' fans will be sorely disappointed in this outing. Not only is the story not Sanford's usual taught, suspenseful, page turner, it was a poorly constructed who-done-it. Gruesome murders, taunting notes, evil incarnate, these are the keys to Sanford's individual style of gripping fiction. Who-done-it? Who cared! Sorry John, you owe us for this one."
2,Confusing and hard to keep track of characters,"I found myself rereading chapters and referring back in the book. Towards the end I think Sandford found himself doing the same thing because suddenly the reader finds himself being ""fed from a firehose"" in two pages, and by that time I had lost track and interest. Not his best."
3,Good book,"This book, the 11th in the Prey series, brings back novel star, Lucas Davenport. This isn't his best book, but it is worth reading. John Sandford is an excellent writer and I would recommend any of his books. This book brings back many of the exciting elements in the Prey books, Money, greed, murder, mystery and beautiful women."
2,I've read them all -- though I should've skipped this one,"I have savoured every ""Prey"" book and look forward with great anticipation whenever a new one is released. However, I was disappointed with ""Easy Prey"" and felt that Mr. Sanford took the easy way out. It seems that at some point he must have realized that the story was coming to an end and that he had no good suspect, so he had better make one materialize. I am glad to say that this is the only ""Prey"" book that I would give 2 stars, just about all the others warrant 5 stars. I suggest you skip right to ""Chosen Prey"", it continues where ""Certain Prey"" left off."
2,"Unfortunately, I agree","What a disappointment! The ""prey"" series has been one that promised me a great read almost every time. Easy Prey delivered little in the way of his previous thrillers. No suspense, no characters of interest and not much action. Unlike earlier books, where I felt the tension and fear, I was totally uninvolved here -- merely an observer."
3,"Not his best, but I'll keep reading John Sanford...","Too many characters and a convoluted plot make this one of the hardest of the ""Prey"" series to get through. Don't get me wrong - I sailed through the book in a couple of hours, but here's the problem -- you don't really care about any particular character, even if you CAN keep them all straight. And he pulls an Agatha Christie at the end -- introducing someone you've never heard from before, and pinning the crime on them. We all know that Sanford can do better - hopefully the next Prey book will live up to his potential..."
2,Disappointing,"When I saw this book at the bookstore, I bought it immediately. I love the entire Prey series and could hardly wait for another one to come along. What a disappointment. I started to read it several times before I could get interested enough to finish it. Too many characters...too much jumping around...and Lucas was not his usual self in this one. I thought about reading it a second time just to see if I missed something the first time around but just couldn't bring myself to do so. I'm still a Lucas Davenport fan though."
3,Somewhat Blah!,"This book is a nice easy read with some suspense, but nowhere near the other ""Prey"" novels. It seemed like a setup for a novel where Lucas"" lovelife gets straightened out a bit..maybe the next novel has all his women in danger.It wasn't a bad read by any means, but I expected better."
3,Not Bad...,"I always enjoy John Sandford's ""Lucas Davenport"" books. This one was ok; a little bit of a disappointment. Not the usual ""Lucas."" Hope the next one brings the old ""Lucas"" back!"
3,Easy Pray,"All John Sandford/Lucas Davenport fans (of whom I am one) should read this book -- and then write to author to say that a little more time plotting and editing would be well-spent. There is a lack of the smooth continuity that has characterized previous works in this character series, and the book is perhaps a bit short in character development and color. Nevertheless I enjoyed it, though not to the extent I did previous efforts."
1,"No More, I Pray","A 49-year-old reader from Honolulu, Hawaii!Mr. Sandford, please end this watered-down formula and retire Lucas Davenport for the good of us all! I can't believe the publishers actually unleashed this tripe on the reading public. Tired jokes, no character development and dialog as witty as string. Reading it was a painfully dull experience. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. It seemed the writer was bored with writing the story - and he passed that feeling on to his readers."
3,"Again,MLB strikes out...Looking.","This could have been great. Combine all of the yearly highlight films,throw in some great games from the vault[there has to be some Seaver games extant }Throw in the WS and LCS that exist.Show some of the original broadcast team Kiners Korner.Well, that is not happening here...As a previous reviewer has stated,this set exists in other forms on other sets. The highlight films from various years do exist[they play on SNY as Mets yearbook] and SNY has broadcast all of the 5 WS games from 1969[albeit the first two on black and white} this set, again desultory in its make-up,proves that the fools at MLB are as clueless as the owner-Commissioner { I know he sold the team,to his family.He was still an owner commissioner.And an ass }.Next time consult a fan.This is a set for met fans who think Endy Chavez' catch in the 2006 LCS was one of the 5 great moments in team history.HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Pretty Lame Chewing Gum,"Eclipse is a rather lame sugarless gum and has a rather rubbery consistency. I have chewed through several packs of different Eclipse flavors and this gum just doesn't do it for me. The pieces are kind of small so I chew two at a time and the flavor lasts all of five seconds leaving you with just this rubbery, not very fun to chew gum in your mouth.If you like Spearmint the very short lived flavor is pretty good but it disappears too fast to enjoy it.I probably will try other brands of sugarless gum. Eclipse just doesn't do it for me."
3,Looks good sounds sort of ok,"I bought the Crosley after finding a box of records at the side of the road. My memory went back to the late '60s mono-player that I had as a kid which had a deep warm sound, the best of any subsequent record player I purchased. It kind of looked like the Crosley although a little bulkier and not quiet as stylish. Unfortunately beyond its looks the Crosley doesn't measure up. The sound, and it is mostly about the sound after all, is shockingly thin. I expected to get used to this but so far have not. Frankly it's borderline awful. If I find a vintage [player that works it will likely be replaced. That said I do get to play old records and hear the vinyl fall on the platter just like I did as a kid. Bad sound aside the nostalgic itch was scratched."
5,"With a little bit of work, what a sound!!","I brought this record player to replace my very old one. It had two outside speakers,with great sound. When my player arrived, the sound made me a litle upset, as I was use to my big speakers.The I got an idea. What if I removed the wires from the inside speakers, and conected my big speakers to it? IT worked, and sounds great. I will admit, without both a bass, terble and balance knob, it does sound different, but with other speakers,I think it sounds much better..With spring and summer coming, my little cottage will once again rock and roll. As a teenager I listened to my records to remember my studies, now I use them to clean, sew, and bring back thoses wonderful years gone by.Enjoy your walk down memory lane!"
2,Why buy this...when it can be had for free.,"A prior reviewer said it best - why spend $7.99 + shipping? This essay prints out on two 8-1/2 x 11 pages and is easily available online. That said, it IS a wonderfully inspiring message."
5,Required Reading,A friend that is also a Bank President recommended me to this slim book. It is required reading by all of his employees. Having responsibility for supervising a number of people myself I found the concept it espouses of taking total responsibility of the tasks on is given quite refreshing. I myself have begun to have all of my organization's new hires read the book and discuss it afterwards. The change in some of them has been remarkable. How thrilling to discuss a new project with a work team and have them dive in with vigor. I agree with the author's assertion that this simple concept should be taught in all colleges and schools across the land.
1,Will I ever get this book???,"Sorry, but I can't rate this book fairly as I still don't have it. It's been almost 5 weeks since I ordered it, and I'm still waiting. Several complaints, and I got a 5 dollar discount on my next order. Why would I order anything else when I have to wait so long to get what I was promised in 2 weeks? Next time I will buy at the local book store. Yes, I will pay more but at least I will have the opportunity to read it before I die of old age."
5,May the person who invented this forever be blessed,"If you're installing speakers or doing anything with lots of double-stranded wire, this little gadget will bring tears of joy. Strips both sides of double-stranded wire, any thickness, with just a squeeze of the handle. Makes stripping regular wire a breeze as well, but it's with double wire that it truly makes your life sooo much easier. Where has this been all my life?"
1,The metal of this griddle is too soft,"I was excited about finding a new pan for making chickpea flour crepes and had read here on Amazon many good reviews about Cuisinart's classic nonstick line. Unfortunately this product (which I didn't get on Amazon) was a big disappointment. I used it once and while cleaning the pan, I managed to make several dents on the sides without realizing. When I looked at it closely, the pan looked ""warped"" like other reviewers have stated. The problem is this rather big pan is sort of unwieldy to clean in a small sink and if it bangs against anything, it will dent."
1,Garbage,"I have had two of these, and they have both been worthless after a little use. The griddle warps, making it useless. It is no longer able to cook eggs nor pancakes because they run to the corners. I had the first one replaced under warranty, but the second one has warped too after just a few uses. It's going in the garbage. Even before it warped, I'll also say that it did not heat evenly. Too thin. This is the only anodized piece of cookware that I own, and if this is a problem with all anodized, I'd give the entire product category 1 star too. If it can't be used on a residential cooktop without damage, it shouldn't be sold."
5,Best books printed,I read this book over 25 years ago and loved it as much now as then. Would recommend it for everyone to read.
3,HELP!!!!!!!,"Will He Survive?I am writing this book review to help YOU decides if you would like to read The Cay or not. This book is about a young boy who lives on a Caribbean island in WW2 that is attacked by German submarines. When his mother decides to sail to America, his adventure begins. This interesting book about survival really gets you thinking. What will happen next?I would say this book is a 3 star book because it has some dull moments where nothing was happening, and some characters have heavy accents that are hard to read. I would say this books reading level is for grades 4-7."
3,"Confusing, yet interesting","This was probably one of the most confusing books that I have ever read! The main character's name was Phillip and he gets stranded on an island during World War II. The guy he is stranded with pretty much speaks another language and that is one of the reasons it is confusing to me. Another reason it is confusing is because you can't picture it. You think it looks like something but it really looks like something else. I kept on reading the same sentences over and over to make sure I understood what they said. However, I liked it because it is a suspenseful book about adventurous survival. If you like suspense and adventure (like me) then read this book. If you like books that involve Princesses and Princes and no suspense whatsoever then I would find a different book. Will they survive? Will the food run out? Will they be rescued? To find the answer to these questions you will have to read the book."
5,The cay by sukhraj,When I read the book the cay i really enjoyed it because it had a lot of the things I liked. The story is about a boy named phillip and a old man named Timothy. The boy does not like Timothy but when they both end up on a island by themselves and phillip becomes blind phil finds he has to rely on Timothy. But they pull it together but not for long. This is a book that is great for any age. And if your a teacher you should read this to your class because they will most likely love it.
4,IT WAS A GOOD BOOK!!!!!,The book that I read was THE CAY. It was a good book and it took me a long time to finish. I got the idea from my brother. I thought it was a bad suggestion but it wasen't. I guess that he told me to read it because it was one of the ones he read. SOo thats my outline on THE CAY.
2,Wasn't the best,"this book had a good story line, but it was hard to keep up with. the way timothy talked, you had to read his language over a couple times to pick out what he was saying."
5,THIS WAS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.,"I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS GREAT.I LOOKED AT SOME OF THE REVIEWS ON THE INTERNET SOME WERE PRETTY DUMB.ONE SAID,IT WOULD BE BETTER WITH BATMAN. I LOVED THIS BOOK,AND I RECOMENED YOU TO READ IT. BY: LANCE ZEIGLER"
4,A GREAT BOOK,"A GREAT BOOK! After his transportation ship explodes, a blind 12-year-old kid must put all his trust in 1 black man as he struggles to survive! Will he live? . Theodore Taylor uses great detail! However, it leaves unanswered questions. Good for: grades 5-7. WARNING: there are some sad scenes."
4,The Cay in a paragraph,This book is a good book to teach a person about survival. The boy {Phillip) and his negro friend get shipwrecked and get stranded on a deserted island. The setting of the book takes place during some fierce fighting during WWII.The boat they were riding in was sunk by a German U-boat.The unusual couple get past there differences and create a unusual bond to keep each other alive.
1,This book is so awesome,This book is awesome I loved it !!! It only took me a day it is based on world war 2 I loved it!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Phillip's Adventure,"The Cay is a great book. I really enjoyed the story. It is about a eleven year old boy who is handicapped with an old man Timothy stranded on an island. Timothy and Phillip learn to work together to stay alive, and Phillip's life changes forever to the head. His struggle to survive depends on Timothy. The Cay is a book that tries to teach the readers many things that gives great meaning. I would like to recommend this book to all the readers out there."
3,A lesson learned,"The Cay is a very good book, it is full of adventure and drama. Theodore Taylor wrote this story with unexpected twists and turns while using very little fore shadowing which gives you a chance to guess at what would happen next in the story. The story begins when a colored man named Timothy rescues a boy named Phillip from drowning after the main ship goes down. Unfortunately their rescue boat veers off course leaving Timothy and Phillip ship-wrecked on a deserted island . I highly recommend this book to people of all ages who like to read."
4,"""Marooned""","Phillip is stranded on a small cay, and is stuck with one man...Timothy. This story tells of how a boy overcomes racism against a newfound friend, and learns to survive while being blind.Phillip is racist because of his mother's hatred towards other cultures. It shows most when Phillip gets upset with Timothy and quotes, ""You stupid old Blackman, you can't even spell.""The setting of the story is a nice tropical island, near the coast of Venezuela. It makes you feel like you were there. The Cay is a very good book and sends a strong message to learn to get along with other races."
3,Intresting...,"I read the book twice (by force) but I liked it anyways. I caught on quickly why Timothy called Phillip ""young bahss"" in the begining of the story. This story is about more than one boy being lost at sea, it is about a boy crossing racial boundaries, forming a friendship, and surviving when the odds were against him.This kid, 11 years old,... doing and induring things i could not imagine. A hurricane, lost on a abandoned tiny island, a shipreck, the death of a companion and friend, and worst of all: being blind...alone. All that in a nutshell you have The Cay a gripping and powerfull book; but I must say that if the book get boring which it will, make a commiment and keep reading it wil pay off in the end.by a mindless 6th grader,..."
1,The Cay is a good book for young readers!,This is a good book for children to read.It is kind of mysterious so you always want to read to find out what happens.It gets your brain working.I would say that this is one of the best books that I have ever read.I would suggest this book to children that want a book to read for fun.
5,An exciting book.,The Cay is a realistic book. I like the part when the eel bit Phillip. I hope you get to read The Cay. I am anxious to read Timothy of the Cay.
4,Fun product that I bought for bridal shower joke,"I purchased this as a joke gift for a bridal shower. It's really, really basic. Probably like the cheapest, crappiest, biggest bra you could get at Walmart but it was perfect for me because I did decorate the bra to pretty it up. It's basically what it claims to be."
4,Not bad is a quick kill,To get the quick and fast H.Y. facts for the boards this is the one! Its shorter and to the point in comparison to BRS. Note this is not a good book for class only for the Boards
5,Colonial America Was No Paradise,"This novel lays bare a darkness at the heart of early American society. The history books do mention the prevalence of indenture, but we don't hear the voices of indentured wives in their pages, so it is left for novelists like Margaret Lawrence to remember their sorrows."
3,Works fine,"This product is adequate for the purpose. Not fantastic, surely not horrible. Sturdy enogh and easy to use. I would buy it again."
4,Good surprise,"Great CD ! If you like Lagwagon, No Use for a Name this CD is for you. I bought it 'cause it looked good and it was a really good surprise when I heard the songs."
5,beautiful changing table,This changing table turned out to be more beautiful than I had anticipated. It's very stunning and durable and the drawer in the front is so deep and handy. I love it and recommend it 100%.
4,Great product,This is a great product. The lady who gives me facials recommended it. I do prefer the color '1g'. That is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5.
3,CNA Study Guide,Good book for basic knowledge. Figures and descriptions are not always on the same page. I found the book to be lacking information on printing.
2,No bargain!,I gave these several gos at re-hydrating. I agree with another reviewer that they are rubbery and tasteless. Finally binned the whole lot.
3,Not for the novice,"This is rather technical book which outlines many of the current British weapons used in counter-terrorism operations. It's a nice reference book to put on your shelf, but I really would not recommend it to just anyone."
2,Easily forgotten purchase,"I thought this would be a neat little contraption to take out to dinner or use at work... But for the most part, I just look like a crazy novice forensic scientist looking for traces of ... well whatever on glasses and silverware, phones and keyboards.. etc.. I have no idea if its working or not. Its just a tiny little led type light.. The directions tell you to wave the light over the surface for 10 seconds... and i thought, directly over? or just hovering above? The difference is about 20 minutes worth of time waving this magic wand over each nook and cranny of said surface... I just don't like it.. its a cool idea.. but I wouldn't buy it again if I could have a do-over."
1,Was not shipped as ordered,I had a event to attend and needed a 50's top. I found a poodle top and had it shipped over night.That was Thursday and my event was Saturday. I paid $37.00 to get it shipped over night and it did not get here until Tuesday afternoon. I am very unhappy. If you can't get it here don't have overnite as an option.Mary McMahon
2,Good reference .. that's about it,"If you're looking for examples of different portraits in outdoor settings this will give you a few examples. There isn't any flow to the book, basically just a bunch of portraits and the photographer explaining how they setup the photo .. after the 5th example it gets very repetative."
4,"Probably three and a half stars, actually.","I love Moore's writing style and sense of humor. I love coming back to Pine Cove. I love saying ""Oh! I know you! You were in that one book!""I should have really enjoyed this book. But although it was good, and I laughed out loud several times, I didn't love it like I did Coyote Blue or Dirty Job. Maybe he was just trying too hard. But any time Roberto the Fruit Bat can save the day, it's probably good times."
3,Book Club selection for December,"The rest of the ladies in our book club enjoyed the book. Personally I found it strange and more like one of the comedy movies that come out directed at pot heads and swearing and shooting and zombies who eat brains...Just not my kind of book.After our meeting, listening to all the comments, I found a better sense of the humor of the author's perspective but I doubt I will read another of his books...who knows...???"
1,The Stupidest Angel,"The Stupidest Angel was not my kind of humor; I did not laugh. I felt it was a waste of my reading time. It was, in fact, the stupidest book I've read in a long time!"
4,Moore Puts His Twist on Christmas....,"...and Christmas will never be the same.Christopher Moore tackles the holiday spirit in his latest offering. Fans of his prior books will recognize favorite characters like Theo, Molly, Tucker Case and his bat, Roberto, and most especially the angel Raziel. Not the sharpest angel in the drawer as we will recall vividly from Lamb.Suffice to say this book chronicles how a Christmas wish by a little boy wreaks havoc on the sleepy California town of Pine Cove. Along the way, we find ourselves experiancing the off-the-wall interactions between a familiar and beloved cast.Still, this book only gets 4 stars. Moore isn't really stretching here, and one might even suggest he's coasting a bit. Of course, Moore's ""coast"" is probably still better then most authors at their full-out best. Still, after the glorious Lamb and the ambitious, if flawed, Fluke, I want to see more from Moore. This book was a wonderful vignette, but I look forward to Moore's next great epic."
4,Laugh until tears run down your face,"Unbelievably funny, the M in Moore must stand for Master of characterization, clever dialogue, irreverance, and outrageous vignettes. I would have given it 5 stars except that the plot was a little cliched (brain-eating zombies) and predictable in spots but didn't detract from the hilarity. I hate to share any of the scenes as they are best read directly from the book (and you can read the plot synopsis above). I actually ordered via express mail copies of this book for each of my 2 sisters for Christmas (I had just read it), something I have never done before. It's that entertaining. If you like sarcastic and bawdy humor that pokes fun at life, I highly recommend it!"
5,Leave 'em wanting more Moore,"This was my first introduction to a Christopher Moore novel. So I don't have anything on which to compare it. What I can say is that after reading this first one, I'm frantically searching for more of his books on audio. The story actually made me laugh out loud. It's a very well told story that, despite being funny, actually keeps you wanting to know what happens next. I loved it. Can't wait to get more."
4,A great story!,"This was a great story to read before Christmas! At times, I had to think ""Am I really reading this?"" I have enjoyed the Pine Cove series and the characters it has introduced me to. This book was no different. Some great laugh out loud moments. Thanks for making Christmas fun with zombies!"
4,great book,this is a good book and i love how text to speech is enabled. i hate how authors disable it because they think we steal it. i only buy books with text to speach because i read along and understand the book more. this book makes me laugh a lot. i laugh at least once per chapter. if you want a book more like a movie thats a co medy buy this. i wish it showed more of the angels point of veiw but still a great book
5,Helping Students Gradute,Provide a concise and approachable method for engaging all stakeholders in students' academic success in a plan that will deliver them to graduation
2,Anti-Western..,"This book has a strong Anti-Western tilt. It whitewashes Islam and is both subtly and at times even overtly negative to Christianity and Western thought. There is ""no mention of jihad as a warlike means to expand Islam; Islamic conquest is described as good, Christian conquest as bad; and non-Western civilizations as benign, Western civilizations as evil.""A good example is that the book doesn't even mention Muslims or jihad when discussing the 9/11 attacks. It also attributes moral equivalence between the Communists and the West during the Cold War. Its clearly written by far left wing ideologists. I would not want my children to read such a book. Its not objective. It seems like its one of these books funded by the Saudi Arabian Kingdom to promote Islam."
4,It's pretty good...don't listen to the guy above me,"Ok This is a pretty good textbook. Now...it's not great...it can make somethings pretty boring. I'm in 9th grade, and I think that it will help me with the regents exam that I will have to take. It also has some pretty interesting info on topics that it is teaching u. Ex: When you're learning about Africa, on the side of the page, there's a thing on the tsetse fly. Teachers, will find this to be helpful."
5,School book,"I needed this book for my criminal justice class and this one was a very good price, I use this book so much in my other classes as well."
2,Jreb,"I too bought the first edition of this CD set off of television. I bought it because it contained the song ""Twas the Night Before Christmas"" performed by Fred Waring. I grew up on this version and to see it lacking in the currently offered selectiobn is a disgrace. It's a shame that Time-Life has chosen to deplete the quality of their product in favor of profits."
2,NOT THE ORIGINAL VERSION,"I bought the original version of this years ago. This is missing an entire cd from the original collection. It's not much of a treasury without Holly Jolly Christmas by Burl Ives. To be honest, the missing cd was why I purchased this for a gift. I'll have to be more careful using Amazon in the future."
5,awesome,best things I could ever buy. use them to clean all my weapons. that is what I was use to in the Military why not carry the tradition. best thing to have in getting in small cracks of a weapon. not to mention can be use for other uses.
5,Awesome Music - This Band Rocks!!,This Band is definitely on the way up. I relly like their CD & can't wait until their next release!!
5,Bizarro classic !,"This is the first bizarro book I ever read. I bought it after reading it had similarities with David Lynch's work (totally true, by the way ! (as far as I'm concernred)). It started out kind of slow but after 60 pages I was hooked and couldn't stop reading !This is the perfect book to read if you're new to the bizarro fiction. It's funny, creepy, dark, surreal and very entertaining.A classic in the genre, VERY highly recommended !"
4,Satisfied with the ending,"I am an avid Palahniuk fan and had gotten linked to Mellick somehow through browsing Amazon. After reading the reviews, I decided to try him out. He definitely has a unique style. The story deals with such themes as cultural apathy, Christian demagogues, and social relationships. At times it is almost like a script for South Park, and other times, somewhat profound insights can be found masked by the silliness. I have to admit there were times in the book where I felt he was flailing, but the end drew everything together nicely without even a real resolution. It made its point and in doing so redeemed some of the tangential writing that preceded the ending."
1,Dont waste your time,"This book, while getting your attention and is rather good with details of characters and even non characters(hence the one star) is an utter waste of ones time. The ending is rubbish. It is a waste... The ending leaves the reader hanging and saying ""What just happened? Is this it? Where is the rest of the book?"" I suggest never buying this book and not listening to the ones that gave it better reviews."
5,Good book for a math amateur,"I am a college student, majoring in math, but not very far along in my major sequence. I found that this book gave me an understandable perspective on what might lie ahead in my studies. I highly recommend this book for anyone who thinks they might be interested in learning more about Mathematics! It inspired me!"
4,math is important,an excellent help in understanding and exploring and usingmathematics more effectively
4,Nikki - Austrian Singer - Primarily Schlager,"I originally heard a song while in Europe in 1986 and heard one song that kept playing over and over on several radio stations. I figured that it must be a Hit Song by a young singer and stopped at several music stores to inquire about it. Finally, one young man let me listen to some songs by a young singer by the name of Nikki. Lo and behold, the CD Album that I bought hoping that it was the one that had the song on was ""Ganz Oder Garnet"". I bought a Tape Cassette and played it often when returning home. Somehow, I lost the tape cassette and just a few days ago, came across the album on YouTube. This CD has not only the song that I had found but also several others from her Ganz Oder Garnet album. I loved all of the songs on this album and would urge those who love this music to get this album also.Beautiful music from Austria, sung in the Austrian ""German"" dialect."
3,progress?,"I took heart from the news that the Politically Correct campuses were now backing the Islamists. Now, at last, I thought, the Jews, who were instrumental is ensconsing P. C. in America, would turn against it and expose it for the fraud that it is.But no. P. C. is too useful to dispense with. The aim is, rather, to re-insert ""Jews"" (along with Blacks, Hispanics, homosexuals, and women) back into the list of groups whom it is suicide to speak against. Great."
1,Everyone Can't Be Wrong...,As another reviewer found the case received was NOT the case shown and wasn't even close to fitting. Even if it fit it is sooo cheesey looking. Its not even worth returning. The charger seems to work ok so I guess I'll hang on to it.
5,DELICIOUS RECIPES,"I LOVE THIS COOKBOOK GREAT RECIPES EASY AND FUN TO MAKE EASY TO FOLLOW STEPS GREAT TASTEING TREATS IF U LOVE BAKING THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU GREAT COOKIES,PIES,CAKES MANY MORE."
5,Very entertaining,"As a 9 month old, my oldest would giggle at the illustrations and then flip the book over for us to read again and again. We had it memorized so if she became fussy on a long car ride we could use it to calm her down. Our whole family still enjoys this tale."
4,good,"My DVD came late, too late for a xmas gift, but it was resent so the effort was definately there. It is a gift for V Day now so I don't know what shape it is in yet, though the cover looks fine."
5,Excellent book for nutritionists and strength coaches,"Dr. DiPasquali digs deep into the finer points of protein metabolism, including the types of proteins, how the body digests them differently, and the other facets that affect how protein is handled by the body. This book is not just repackaged dogma from the USDA. Dr. DiPasquali makes claims- that are supported by clinical studies- that run counter to what many nutritionists say but are truths that are have been known for decades by those who train with strength and muscular gain in mind. An excellent resource."
5,"Upholds all of ""Joseph's"" wit and charm","This CD is the soundtrack of the 2005/2006 Troika National US Tour starring Broadway veteran actor Patrick Cassidy and ""American Idol"" second season finalist Amy Adams.This CD joins the company of past recordings of this wonderful ""feel good"" Webber/Rice musical, and does justice to upholding all the charm of the show. I've seen the live performance of this current tour, and listening to this CD continues my enjoyment of what I saw onstage. Though this is Amy Adams' musical theatre debut as The Narrator, she handles the storytelling lyrics beautifully. In April 2005, Patrick Cassidy was named one of the World's Top Five ranked stars of ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"" coming in second only to former teen idol Donny Osmond among the top Joseph performers. Patrick's vocals, particularly his rendition of ""Close Every Door"", definitely justifies that Top Five honor. I recommend this CD to be added to the collection of every ""Joseph"" fan."
3,1st Album Shows Promise,"This is Jimmy's first album when he was still trying to make it on the folk circuit in New Orleans and Nashville at the end of the 60's. He had not found his laid back beach bum persona yet, and the material on this disc is quite different from his later stuff. Mostly folk-ish with a bit of country with 60's style hippie sentiments in the music. This album is a mixed bag, but on a few tunes Jimmy's songwriting really shines and shows the potential of where he will eventually go. ""The Captain And The Kid"" is a great song about his grandfather that he still does live today. ""Ellis Dee"" (LSD...get it) is a typical Buffett play on words, ""A Mile High In Denver"" is Buffett's answer to John Denver. There is also some real crap on this album bad country such as ""Truckstop Salvation"" and the attempted social statement in ""Captain America"". This album is certainly far from Jimmy's best, but for a first album it certainly shows potential."
4,Essential Buffett Album,"One of our man Jimmy's earliest works, this full-length album showcases Buffett's inherent song writing ability. The lyrics, melodies, and arrangements all tell fascinating stories in true creative style. This is an early look at the country, western, and Gulf coast influences that led to the popularized music of Jimmy's today. The album is fun, thought-provoking, and relaxing, in Jimmy's early style."
4,Frank Herbert: 4 Complete Novels,I've read them individual a long time ago. I've found them in one I could read them anytime.
5,Desert Punk FTW,"Great purchase! Thats all I can really say I watched this series non-stop for 3 months because i loved it so much. I am happy that I purchased this set.The set comes in crappy little plastic cases, but that doesnt take away from the quaility of the show. Im not much for purchase presentation when it comes to movies, as long as the picture is high quality and the show rocks. which it does. This review probably wasnt very helpful, but i assume that anyone thinking about purchasing this collection has seen the show and is just debating wether or not to shell out the cash-do it!"
4,Demon of the Desert,"Desert Park is NOT for children, or for anyone that's not into some very crude humor. With that said, you'll probably laugh when the first episode is over and wonder what'll come next. While devoid of a real plot except the last 5 episodes, this anime is pretty good. It has fanservice thanks to the busty Junko and Desert Punk spends his time trying to woo her....and failing miserably (perhaps they get together by the end of the series?). This anime is the funniest anime I ever watched, but its crude humor....don't watch if you're easily offended by the humor.Desert Punk is known as the ""demon of the desert"" and is a very skilled bounty hunter and merc that goes around doing jobs while trying to survive the savage heat of the desert. This is set thousands of years in the future after something wiped out the last civilization. The people of the desert call our time the ""dark ages"". A highly enjoyable anime if you're looking for something a bit different."
4,Couldn't believe it myself,"I was in a slum in my anime watching career when I bought this, I had just watched about 3 full series I would consider ""Bad"" I thought the fun part of the ride was over and then this came in the mail and Totally renewed my love for anime. It's got pretty good fight scenes but it's not all about fighting it's about the hilarious journey of a teenage assassin with a thing for Tig ole Bitties. Like most anime I watch the end sucked but don't let that detour you this is a quality anime with adult themes that will make you laugh."
5,One word UNDERRATED!,"This has to be one of the funniest animes I have EVER watched and I've watched plenty. It has it's ""dark"" humor so if you're not into that, then don't get it, if you are or don't mind then by all means get it! This anime will make you piss your pants, truly a fantastic anime, you won't be disappointed."
3,Pretty Great,"I had to read this book for my English class. When I first got it, I thought the book would be boring, but as I got into the book I started to understand everything that is going on. It would really suck to get married to a slave owner and then have him leave when his 3 month old son dies to marry someone else in Rome."
1,What was the mystery?,"The only thing mysterious about this book was that I finished it. The characters were not likeable, the setting was grim, the crime was obvious. The Alaskan atmosphere was laid on thick.The writing was overly poetic to no purpose. What was with the quotes from famous poets like Mandelstam? The whole thing was a big mess."
2,Bleak mystery in Alaska,"One of several volumes by this author, about the only private eye in Sitka. A woman survived a terrible attack by local workers, only to vanish and perhaps be the victim of the same foul play again. What is the answer to this puzzling case?You can't fault the gritty setting, but you can do so with the unrelenting airlessness of the plotline. Not many people other than the victim impress the reader as in any way sympathetic. There are also stretches in the middle where the prose is confusing and it's difficult to even tell what's going on. Straley is a good writer, but this is hardly his best."
4,The most complete coverage of AF Special Ops to date,"I have read every book on Air Force Special Ops, and by far this is the most current and illistrative. While the photos may be staged, considering the secret nature of Special Ops, real-time photos may not even exsist, let alone be de-classified: they are very illistative of many aspects of operations. There are so many books about SEALS, Special Forces, Rangers, etc. and AF SpecOps is so overlooked, it is about time they get some equal time. This book is the best I have seen, to date."
2,"So-So, Average Attempts at...whatever this is.","This isn't fiction, this isn't even art. It seems Jaffe is trying to tell us something about the permeable nature of the news and how easily it can be altered. After two or three ""stories,"" I had to ask myself: so what? The point has been made. Maybe this should have been a chapbook. I got bored very fast, so I changed the channel."
5,"Very good, high quality product","Superb quality, much better and thicker than anything I've seen in stores. The support it gives you is excellent, and I can tell since using it this is going to last quite awhile, most likely much longer than the products I purchases from other companies. It's more expensive than other waistbands, but you get what you pay for."
3,"Great little bubble disc, but it needs some weight...","Good bubble disc, but it floats unless you bury it with substrate or use the airline tubing with suction cups to keep it down. (I used the suction cup method and it works fine) It puts out a huge amount of bubbles (I'm using it with a whisper 20 pump) which is actually too much for my platies to handle. But the aeration is great. Overall a decent disc for the money."
2,"Air diffusion not that good, tendency to float and flip","It works, just not very well. The air diffusion is not good, most of the air comes out of the edges as opposed from the entire disk.There is also a high tendency for the disk to float up a little and eventually flip over, so the diffusion portion faces down and you end up generating large bubbles instead of thousands of tiny ones. To alleviate this, I weigh it down by placing rocks or ornaments on top.I still use mine, but would not buy it again."
2,"Typo galore, missing critical information.","This publication needs a lot of work. I would not recommend this book to be the primary study guide to anyone preparing for the 70-059 Microsoft exam. I had three questions on the exam on PPTP, and this book neglected to include more than a couple vague sentences about this subject. I still passed the exam (862) with the help of the Exam Cram book and Transcenders practice tests. Don't waste your money here."
5,midnight movie,i havent seen this yet but this looks like a fun bloody movie if u love horror movie id watch it
1,Disappointment abounds,"Having read all of Stuart Woods' books, usually as they first come out, this one is very disappointing. The book goes nowhere slowly. Although Holly Barker has always been a likable character, it is unbelievable that she would go through a few weeks CIA training to become an assistant to Lance Cabot. The entire book is spent with the CIA chasing Teddy Fay, although they are mainly chasing their own tails. There are no exciting subplots or getting to know the characters any better. You keep waiting for the book to take a new turn or get better, but it never does.Apparently Mr. Woods has become content with mechanical writing and relies on his name and reputation to sell books. Put some effort into it, and give us back the writing we are used to. Any more dissapointments like this one, and I'll have to stop buying them."
1,Terrible Ending and Torture Getting There,"I can't believe this tripe would be published. I took this out of the library on CD and found myself yelling at the radio, ""are you kidding me?"" Not sure how many times Holly looks right at Teddy Fay and says ""Gee I think that's Teddy Fay, but he had on a blue jacket in the last description of him"" then ""hmmmm, I think I'll turn around, talk to someone, lose sight of Teddy, decide it's really him and chase him after I've lost sight of him"". The things that happen in this book don't ask you to suspend disbelief they ask you to get a lobotomy before you begin. I've listened to plenty of Stone Barrington books and been entertained. That's why I got this book. Never again, unless I'm getting old Stuart Woods books. This was abysmal!! (not even worth the free library check out)"
3,Conair 124A 1600 Watt Mini Hair Dryer,"The product works well - almost like my last ConAir 1600 watt mini, with one exception. The fan control has been moved from the inside of the handle by the thumb, to the outside of the handle. This is definitely NOT user friendly - to change fan speed, you have to stop drying, turn the dryer, move the switch, turn the dryer, and resume drying. Buy the ConAir 1875 watt model instead! It has the fan control where it belongs."
4,"Good, but not great","The hairdryer was exactly what I wanted - almost. I don't like a powerful hairdryer because I have thin, short hair. So, I never use the high setting. However, the low setting on this dryer isn't quite powerful enough. It's a great travel hair dryer, though, and since I travel a lot, it's perfect for me."
1,CONAIR 124AR VAGABOND MINI DRYER,"I JUST OPENED THE BOX AND USED THE DRYER FOR THE FIRST TIME AND AFTER THE DRYER WAS RUNNING FOR ABOUT 4 MINUTES, THE UNIT DIED ON ME. SO, I WOULD NOT PURCHASE THE ITEM IF I WERE YOU. CHEAP PRODUCT EQUALS POOR QUALITH"
1,NO Stars,"This piece of trash turned on, began getting hot, and blew air for ONE second before burning out and ceasing operation. It never worked again. Total waste of money."
3,It's not what I expected,I expected the original singers on most of the songs and was disappointed when I played it and found it not to be that way.
2,good for a three year old...DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I just got this gun today, it is so small i feel like im going to break it when i use it, i shot it with the ammo it came with, the thing went like 3 feet no lie. you get what you pay for with this gun. I wont give it three weeks until it breaks. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Lots of flash backs.,"Outside of the OVA which is more like a short toss away episode, the rest of the material is taken from the other episodes. Fun if you want a quick summery of the show, based totally on the battle scenes, but nothing new. On the other hand, the Ugetsu Hakua Special is like a music video, using the opening theme song and updated, more realistic character designs. The girls look hot. But I bet you could get it off the internet, so why bother to buy this DVD? If you HAVE to buy it, get it used."
5,We love it!,"Can't believe how long I cooked before I discovered grill pans. This pan is great - lightweight but really well made. I've cooked Steaks, Chicken, Seafood and they have all turned out super. Still can't beat grilling outdoors, but in the winter it is a great alternative. Cleanup is very easy, takes a little effort get into the grooves. So far the cooking surface seems to be wearing very well. Excellent value, would highly recommend."
2,Not what I expected.......,"I am glad I didn't pay full price on this, it's not what I expected. You cannot get the grill marks at all-burns it."
2,This is not the regular formula!,"When I received this item, it was the ""Vertical Surface"" formula, which is thickened and doesn't soak down into carpet padding well. I tried to exchange the item, but EntireleyPets doesn't carry the regular formula and wouldn't refund me because if you ENLARGE the photo, it clearly says ""VS"" on the label. You can't use this formula as an area spray, since it dries with residue that the bottle says needs to be cleaned thoroughly before allowing pets near it. The vendor has been pretty uncooperative - I ordered through them directly and they charged me $20 more than if I had ordered through Amazon.com - and wouldn't pricematch their OWN price! Probably will not order from this vendor again."
2,Ignoring smell of its own,"Ordered a 500 ml bottle and black light. It worked reasonably well, but not perfect (you first apply Urine-Off, then let it dry then reapply and let it dry again usually several times before cat urine stains are gone). Anyway it worked and I ordered a 5 litre bottle, which does not seem to work at all and customer service does not reply to my mails - very disappointing.But worst part is almost the smell that Urine-Off leaves behind its almost worse than the urine smell itselft. Still looking for a proper cat urine stain remover!"
3,.... and they just get noisier ...,"Black Dice has seemed to stray away from more ""song"" oriented material and gone toward more noise. Only six of the twenty-two minutes on this album could be described as songs, although, you be hard pressed to find any structure, melody, etc... The first track is a soft feedback hum with odd background noises, played over an out of tune broken down music box. The last track is twelve or so minutes of harsh guitar feedback with cymbals. The middle ""songs"" are the only tracks were all members contribute. I think it's interesting though..."
3,...Pretty good,"Actually, I liked the previous version of this album better, the demo copy. It sounds a little more rough."
2,"Interesting, but thick going","While presenting information that is, in itself interesting, this book was difficult for me to get through. The use of italics in place of quotation marks seemed pretentious, and the book itself leapt from topic to topic, so that I was frequently confused as to who was doing what to whom. Better books on the topic might be _Excellent Cadavers_, an exhaustive book on the Mafia, and _On Persephone's Island_, about an American woman's experiences after marrying a Sicilian. I really wanted to enjoy Midnight in Sicily, but wasn't able to warm up to it at all."
1,A Schizophrenic Look at Sicily Misses the Mark,"The author of this virtually unreadable book cannot decide if he is writing a travel book, a cookbook, a history book, or a commentary on the complex relationship between the mafia, the government, and the Sicilian people. This unorganized and schizophrenic review of the aforementioned subjects jumps from topic to topic and era to era without warning and with such speed that it makes one dizzy. A detailed description of a meeting that took place between a mafia boss and a government official is suddenly interrupted by a maddeningly detailed account of a meal that the author had eaten in a particular restaurant, complete with an equally mind-numbing description of the restaurant itself and the surrounding landscape. Moreover, the author frequently interjects his own socialogical/philosophical comments regarding the mafia, the govenernment, and the Italian people that are unfounded and frequently miss the mark. I would not recommend this book."
3,So realistic!,"I got this for my 4 year old for his birthday (along with Buzz) and he loved it - until his tory story phase was over (not into Cars) and also Buzz was much cooler with the pop out wings. But little sister adores woody, hugs him and carries him around and pulls the string. So it wasnt wasted. Although he only says one phrase from the movie and there is a strange phrase about ""hey I am lookin good"", but other than that he is very sturdy and cute. Looks EXACTLY like the Woody from the movie."
5,Good Woody,"Ordered Woody for my granddaughter for her birthday from Amazon. It was a very good price, it was the real deal and was brand new. She loves it."
3,"Guys hate it, can't be all bad","Judging from previous reviews, this book can't be all bad. If there is one thing I have learned from my divorce, it is that the most convincing (best lying) party wins. I am NOT winning. It must be time to level the playing field. If the guys hate it, I love it."
4,must read for men,"This book should be required reading for all males age 18-40 who are either contemplating getting married or making the mistake of getting married again. One must move beyond the shallow male vs female argument and focus on how marriage,while never being in mens interests, is now more than ever just a temporary business arrangement that should be avoided at all costs. This book will reinforce that modern independent males are powerless against the perverted religious and biased government interests that perpetuate the institution of marriage. Read it - then join the national mens marriage boycott."
4,Good book Needs editor,"This was a good book and a heartfelt story, very dramatic. However the book has many grammatical errors that need edited. Some of these errors make a few points impossible to understand. I did like the book and it was very powerful."
1,Beware! plan on a mess!!,"This seems like a good idea, BUT!!The roller is held on by a ring of barbed fingers that are supposed to hold onto a collar of the roller cover holder. The problem is that the collar has rounded edges, I assume so you can remove the roller, that ""let go"" when you ""pull the trigger"" of the paint sprayer. The Paint Crew develops enough pressure, with these newer and thicker latex paints, to blow the cover off the arm assembly. Needless to say you get a paint-bath if you are doing a ceiling...........guess how I know that!!Good idea but poor design!! Other ones I have used have a positive system for holding the roller on that is not a handy dandy snap on plastic toy........ but a threaded screw type of retainer to hold the roller on..."
5,ANOTHER MASTERFUL COLLECTION,"Wayne Holmes has done it again. Where does this guy find these stories? He has an unfailing feel for the tale that warms, charms, touches, and uplifts. I don't think you could read all the way through the collection without your eyes misting up occasionally, coupled with smiles and chuckles. This is a book to savor!"
4,Fascinating collection by too often overlooked writer,"Cyril Kornbluth died almost a half century ago, leaving behind many great stories written in SF's golden age. The short stories have been conveniently collected into one hardcover.Kornbluth's stories are not sweetness and light, he writes of the darkness in the human spirit, even in the point of view characters in the books. ""The Little Black Bag"" is an example of how the urge to do good can fall to evil. ""That Share of Glory,"" perhaps his greatest work, is the tale of a young man of the future who learns that even our urge to violence, that we attempt to keep hidden, is very much a necessary part of the human spirit.Every story is a gem. While some are written in a style which now seems somwhat dated, it is easy to get past that and recognize the genius who wrote them."
5,Less J.C. makes Great CD (BIGGEST Nawth Cackalacki fan),"Great CD. Outstanding vocal performance. Great riffs and raw emotion. Speed Whore rocks. Polly Logies is kick-a. Emil is probably is cool guy, just got mixed up with devil in a skirt, but hopefully is recovered by now.These guys will make it big and make all the ex-girlfriends mad, particularly one. They'll have their own ""entourage""."
3,sequels never match up to the original,"I really liked this book, but it is not as emotionally heart-wrenching as the first book ""These is My Words"". I loved the continuing story of characters I had come to love in the first book, and I was rewarded with many trials and losses in Sarah's life. I will keep this book and re-read it along with ""These is My Words"" because I'm such a fan of Sarah's."
2,not as good as These is My Words,"I wanted to read this because I loved her first book, These is My Words. But this sequel lacks the page-turning action, the jaw-dropping adventures, the humor, and the awe-inspiring romance. I frankly found it boring and couldn't even finish it the first time through. I have since picked it up again, and am making better progress."
5,"A great read, an outstanding gift","I purchased Arundel while on a trip to New England, and began reading it immediately. It gave me a sense of history as I passed places which had, until then, had no meaning. To drive pass the Ossipee mountains, Saco River, Dead River, etc., from Maine into New Hampshire becomes so much more meaningful after reading this. Hard to say whether it was the history or the compelling story which I enjoyed most, but both make this book a valuable addition to my library."
2,"1,000 Strings does Cuban Music","I cannot claim any expertise when it comes to what is ""authentic"" Cuban music, but I can say that this CD sounds like I'm listening to Lawrence Welk or Percy Faith doing Cuban. Both have highly skilled musicians, but something about the renditions on this CD just feels wrong - synthetic. I give it two stars for the musical competence."
5,A Single Woman's Parenting Journey,Ms. Curtis does a wonderful job of giving discouraged single parents a booster from a Christian perspective. It's obvious that she writes this wonderful practical resource from experience. This is a must read for all parents journeying down the road solo.
2,Warning! Sherlock Holmes Fans: Don't Read,"Self-serving destruction of a classic character, the story is engaging through its pages, and incorporates many of the snippits and characterizations of Doyle's stories... but without the greatness that has made Doyle's characters live and be loved for so long.The ending is an atrocity... and so far-fetched that I, too, was looking for the double-twist ending - which did not arrive. This book is an injustice to a fine writer, Doyle... and a fine character... and to a large group of fans of all the Holmes stories - Doyle-created or otherwise.This is not a book for true Sherlock Holmes fans."
2,Self-serving Destruction of a Classic Figure,"This book is well-written from the reader's point of view. The story is good and worthy of Holmes and Doyle fans in his details and structure.... and quite readable: until its portentous ending which only served to make me believe that Mr. Dibdin chooses to create his own Sherlock Holmes-type character to usurp that of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's creation.The outcome is one which made me: (1) throw the book in the garbage immediately, and (2) vow never to again read a Michael Dibdin work!"
4,Imaginative and shocking,"Let me say this first: this is not a novel for the squeamish. The Last Sherlock Holmes story is a visceral retelling of the events surrounding the Jack the Ripper murders with the fanciful addition of Holmes as chief investigator. Though the novel abounds with the trappings of classic Holmes stories -- the narration of Watson, the scalpel-sharp intellect of Holmes, even the pipe and Persian slipper -- the comparison ends there. Dibdin's Holmes is a man of deep complications, as is his Watson. The classic characters are given rich humanity, with sometimes frightening results. Though purists of the Holmes genre might quibble, this is a powerful and convincing novel, made all the more plausible by its inclusion of accurate details from the Ripper murders. How convincing is it? After I put the book down, the numb shock didn't wear off for at least two days. Read this book!"
5,You Need this Book,"If you are working or studying in a biomedical discipline, you need this book. Borror's Dictionary constitutes a portable, easily used guide to the Latin and Greek (and a few other languages) roots that constitute the building blocks of medical and scientific lexicons. Dollar for dollar, it represents one of the best purchases a student can make toward his or her education."
4,A Classic,"Although there are more detailed books of this kind which Amazon carries, I purchased this classic for a budding physician who is a scribe in our local hospital. It is one I used in nursing school and in medical transcription. Part sentiment, part a simple introduction to roots. He was exceedingly grateful and pleased with the book."
1,topical bible series - the healing touch of jesus (vhs),"For the most part the video was o.k. It moved rather slow and it wasn't necessary to include the main actor's opinions of the video at the end of the tape. Troccoli's comments throughout the video were well placed and truly saved the video from complete bordom. The scenery was beautiful and the message clear, but over all the video was slow moving and boring. I do hope Troccoli considers narrating other topical bible series in the future,because she saved this one from being a total snoozer."
2,Boring,"I really hate this book, I thik it has the right Ideas, but the author use the wrong strategy to implement the ideas. This book has a lack of important information. so if you're looking to buy a security book, I'm sure you'll find something better than this."
5,Birthday gift,"Personally this is not my style, however, it's what my daughter asked for and loved. So, to each is own."
1,BEWARE - Disc 7 is DEFECTIVE!!!,"The final disc in this boxset (disc 7) is FAULTY! The image is pixelated then freezes! Apparently it is said to be a manufacturing defect so getting it replaced is pointless! I've already submitted a request to Amazon for a full refund. My advice is to wait for the manufacturer to correct the problem before purchasing the set. Its a shame though, I REALLY wanted this set! Without a doubt, one of the most rivetting shows on television today - Thank Goodness for David E. Kelley!"
4,"Truly, Madly, Deeply Fun","Boston Legal deserves kudos for its colorful interpretation of the inner workings of a lawyer's mind. Season 2 is longer, slicker and much more of an entertainer than the first season. The show churns out one gripping case after another, not forgetting, in its trademark fashion, to also introduce us to some of the strangest, most oddball characters in the world.The story arcs, relationships and cases are well written and complement the craziness of the show and of the dynamic duo heading it. While every episode is great, some of the best ones come midway through the season when Michael J. Fox sweeps the show away with his cancer-ridden yet profoundly charming special appearance.Overall, the some of the best work to come from the cast and writers of the show and the only season that's worth the watch for any Boston Legal or Practice fan. If that's not enough, here's the two words that clich every deal -DENNY CRANE!"
1,Meh,"Holy Salinger wannabe. All the main character does is whine, whine, whine, the whole book. It got old fast."
5,A Rocker/Writer?,"This book (and specifically the author) rocks my world. I relate a lot to the story and M. Dylan Raskin's feelings...I think he's the male version of me. Unfortunately I can't seem to find much information about him on the internet but from what I've heard he's been seen around with some hard rock girl who's suppose to be pretty wild. That appears weird to me because he doesn't seem the type to want to have anything to do with anybody who's rich and has any notoriety...unless he sold out. I recommend this book to all alienated 20 and 30 somethings who don't quite fit in. You'll realize something familiar on the pages of this book; for me the second to last chapter resonates the strongest, I cried my eyes out when reading it because it described my feelings perfectly. It was written amazingly. After hearing all the rumors the only question I have is...who is M. Dylan Raskin? Writer or Rocker?5 stars for the book...1 star for the rocker girlfriend if it is true)"
5,"Elvis great talent outside the ""norm"".","This CD is a great way for the new fan or the fan whose affection for Elvis is growing to truly discover the multifaceted vocal talents that Elvis possessed. It takes you outside the ""overplayed"" standards that everyone grew up listening to on the radio and thrusts the fan into a broader realm of his great instrument. Elvis' voice."
4,"Quirky, but works",Of all the World Party albums this one has probably emerged as my favourite: A good mix of songs knit together mostly by very strong melodies and intelligent lyrics. After the intensity and rage of Bang! I don't know where else Karl Wallinger could have gone but to this more relaxed and more personal place. Just listened to it again tonight and these 15 jewels sound as fresh as ever.
4,A good late Hichcock movie!,"This movie would have been better if the script was good and some of the settings. This star studded movie starring Julie Andrews and Pual Newman,makes it enjoyable and the movie has some good noted momments."
3,Interesting Suspense Thriller.,"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.Torn Curtain is an interesting film which pairs Julie Andrews & Paul Newman with Sir Alfred Hitchcock for the first and only time. Though the plot is somewhat intriguing, it's slower than previous Hitchcock films and therefore tends to drag a little bit. The seequence on the bus & the murder of Gromek are the highlights of the film, proving that the Master retains his unique touch. Stick with his previous films, though.Rated PG (a brief sex scene at the beginning, mild violence & some mild language)"
1,"dull, dull dull","Hitchcock made some brilliant films in his later years (The Birds, Vertigo, and Pyscho) this certainly not being one of them. Its about 30 minutes too long and Paul Newman and Julie Andrews had no chemistry whatsoever. I really can't tell you one good thing about this film. So everyone stay away!!!!"
2,One of the masters worst!,"Oh man was this movie a dud. Its hard to believe this is an Alfred Hitchcock film. The film gets an extra star simply for the gorgeous photography and excellent farm house sequence, other than that there is very little to offer with this snooze fest. Newman and Andrews are pretty much wasted as a couple in Berlin posing as spies. They do the best they can with a suspenseless (a word I thought I would never use when reviewing a Hitchcock film) story. The whole movie was just so damn lethargic. You do not really care about any of the characters in this movie or what happens to them. Hitchcock would follow this with the far superior Topaz, however, even that film falls short in many areas. The late sixties found Hitch in a slump. He would be right back at his macabre mastery in '71 with the thriller Frenzy. This just happens to be one in the directors catalog that you can skip unless you are intent (like I was) on seeing everything Hitchcock has put out."
2,Hitchcock in Decline,"The Master of Suspense stumbles badly in this ill-conceived Cold War melodrama. Miscast stars, few thrills and no Bernard Herrmann. ""Torn Curtain"" (1966) is worth seeing once for its prolonged murder sequence - the sole highlight of a lackluster Alfred Hitchcock film."
5,too much DHEA for most people,"Thought I could cut it in half, but it crumbles. Natrol is one of my favorite companies, and this is obviously not the manufacturer's fault. They advertise a 10 mg DHEA and that's what you get. Just be aware it won't cut in half without crumbling."
5,Classic,Red Skelton was one of the best comedians in the world. this guy was so funy. and still is today in his classic show and movies. this guy was phenomanal.
2,the filler thriller,"Well, I picked up this book because I thought, ""Sweet. SEALs, middle east, covert ops, what's not to love??"" Well the book was more like a documentary or briefing most of the time. It focuses far too much on the development of a SEAL and their organization. If I wanted to read about that, I would've picked up a book about the making of a Navy SEAL. I was disappointed. The story really only had a few exciting parts and those tended to come towards the end of the book. Let's put it this way, he spends around ten pages telling what should've been an exciting mission aboard a ship, only to tell us that the men on board were not dumb enough to carry weapons. Hmph. If you are looking for enemy contact, look elsewhere."
1,What a waste.,"For me this book was a waste of money. I went looking for new informationbut many of the operations that Dick Couch writes about have already beendetailed in other books (Not a Good Day to Die, Shadow Wars; Special Forcesin the New Battle Against Terrorism etc), and in greater detail. The firstportion of the book deals with SEAL training, which I've seen much materialon before so there is really nothing new there. The other flaw in this bookis its totally uncritical eye....at times it reads like a recruitingbrochure. There are few problems with SEAL operations, the Army, Navy andAir Force get along as one big happy family, etc. Reality isn't like that;missions are complex, bureaucrats and politicians bungle, there isin-fighting among the services, etc. so why not present the real story? Dickcertainly has the credentials to do that but doesn't. There is NO WAY thisbook is worth the cover price."
3,Down Range Review,"Personally I would have enjoyed more reports of actual action involvements. Although there were numerous reporrts of Seal involvements the narrative,for me , became slowed down and complicated by the frequent acromyms and description(s) of command decision chains. Am looking forward to strarting ""Chosen Soldier"" next"
1,Tedious and boring,"Only because I find it genetically impossible not to finish a book I have begun did I slog my way through this alleged 'mystery'. If one has a fascination with the geography and background of Annapolis and some of its buildings, this book might provide a few dozen pages of interest. If one, however, is seeking a well-crafted mystery, I suggest you try someone else's effort."
4,Wonderful Book,"I truly enjoyed this book and found it to be invaluable during my twin pregnancy. It is a good resource guide with beautiful photographs; and it is written without the self-righteous tone found in other holistic-oriented books. Although I'm not an advocate for the use of the term ""natural"" (which I believe is a rather subjective and broad term), I found the suggested complementary therapies for various pregnancy and post partum related conditions extremely helpful."
5,ABSOLUTELY MARVELOUS!,"THIS BOOK IS ON A LEVEL BY ITSELF. WORDS REALLY CANNOT EXPLAIN THE FEELING YOUR GET FROM READING THIS BOOK. IT WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH, IT WILL MAKE YOU CRY, IT WILL MAKE YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL REALTIONSHIP WITH GOD. THIS IS A FIVE STAR BOOK YOU HAVE TO READ IT TO KNOW. I GIVE IT TWO THUMBS UP........ABSOLUTELY MARVELOUS!"
4,Good mixer,Overall this is a good mixer with good attachments. It also looks great when left on the counter. I just wish I knew it wasn't variable speed when I bought it. That might have made me change my mind.
1,"La Creuset Halo Enamel-on-steel 1-1/2 qt. Kettle, Carribean","I rec'd this kettle and was pleased with the color and weight.However after only 2 months of limited use I noticed the enamelon the bottom edge was chipped in a couple of places. It sits onmy stove and is used only a couple of times a week. I can't understandhow it was chipped by being filed with water or placed on a stove. Not banged.The enamel is not a good choice, I will go back to all metal.I sent a email to the seller through Amazon and they never responded."
5,"Stylish, durable, small","This is our second Le Crueset tea kettle, bought for our ski camp (the other is for our home). It's very well made, durable, and doesn't take up a lot of stovetop space (20"" range, so important consideration). Still, it holds plenty of water, and functions every bit as well as our more full size one at home. The best part is that the handle remains cool enough to hold without gloves in most cases. Enjoy."
1,Beauty is fleeting.,"It was a beautiful kettle, but quickly became blackened and rusty. The enamel came off along the bottom and top under normal use. The handle, almost from the beginning, was loose and feels like it is going to break off.Last week the plastic ""whistle"" lost it's pin and broke. No abuse, just normal everyday use.Seem liked it would be very nice for the price, but it was not a solid product a from an otherwise wonderful company."
2,Bride to be Crystal Tank,The tank itself was very nice but the sizes are misleading. I ordered an extra large (10-12) and it didn't fit my sisterinlaw who came all the way up from Texas to NJ for her wedding. I wanted it to be special and ended up paying $55.00 including an overnight fee for her to get it on time. The shirt fit like a medium (6-8). I contacted the seller Sandy Keller at Advantage Bridal and she only offered me an exchange. Not only was there not a larger size but at this point it was too late. The bacholorette party had come and gone and Sandy never got back to me having tried contacting her several times as to a credit/refund. I have contacted Amazon on this seller already. Don't order from this site. I just gotta hope now that I have a really skinny anorexic friend getting married soon so I can give her the shirt and not waste my hard earned money.
1,THIS IS NOT A VERY ENTERTAINING CD..........,This is the first Danny Wright cd i have ever bought. I didn't know what to expect when i bouhgt this cd so i had a lot of questions that needed to be answered. I have all the questions answered now and i reallly don't like the answeres that i got. Out of 13 songs listed i only liked 3 songs. Danny doesn't play with much emotion and feeling.
4,Perfect navy pump,"These are a great pair of navy pumps. Classy & sophisticated, but fun and can be paired with funky accessories for a more young look. Comfortable too!"
5,I shooked of inspiration when I saw this one!,"This event surprised me with it's unbelievable glamour. Every match was so exiting. The opening math set Lex Luger and the Brittish Bulldog against Jacob and Eli Blue, then Jeff Jarret defends his IC-title against RazorRamon. I's so fun when the 123-Kid jumps in the ring in the end of the match and just kicks the hell out of Jarret. Of course the championchip match between Shawn Mikaels and Big Daddy Cool was awsome. When you se a match like that you wonder how much punishment a wrestler can get (I refear to Shawn Mikaels). The final match is NFL-star Lawrence Taylor meeting Bam Bam Bigelow. I can't describe how fantastic exiting this math was, you just have to se it to know. But probably the main thing that was best with this extravaganza event was all the Hollywood stars who joined a couple of wrestlers and ringside. Puhhh! What a grait one."
3,okay,I think it was good because two of the most beutiful women; jenny mcarthy and pamela anderson made a spectaculer showing but i disagre with the conclusion to the wwf title match because shawn michaels had diesl pinned and i had ordered this on ppv and i was upset with the wwf title match.Thats why i say its okay
2,Bleh... Bad WrestleMania,"Not terribly insulting or anything, but not worth it. This was during the WWF's ""Bad period"" in 1995 when they BOMBED under Diesel, much like WCW recently. Buy WrestleMania III or X instead..."
3,"Not a bad guide, but one annoying thing left out...","This book is a pretty good simple guide, but I was quite annoyed when I got to the part about the actual quilting. She doesn't really tell the beginner how to do the basic hand-quilting stitch! I figured out something on my own anyhow and I know it's just a running stitch, but the quilting stitch shouldn't be glossed over in a quilting book for beginners! I would have appreciated a diagram and something more than one or two throwaway sentences on the subject."
2,Needs more explanation,Not a good book for first time quilters needing step by step instructions. Good beginning quilts but little step by step detailed instructions.
4,This album just plain rocks!,This album will remind you what good true metal in its classic form should sound like;A definite good time to be had by all.
3,Stars Michelle Qwan....,"This movie might be good since it stars Michelle Qwan. It looks a little more for older kids than Because of Winn Dixie, which looks like a complete little kid's movie. It might be good. I'll consider seeing it."
2,I hate G rated movies,"Why would this movie be name ""Ice Princess"" Casey Caryle can't do magic by turing things into ice. She is a dork who learns mathematical fomula tricky skating jumps that other high schoolers are doing it's all because she wants a scholarship. On her way to Harverd she tried to do some jumps herself that's when she had no idea she had talent. I say she should forget college and be an athletic. I really can't believe Kim Cattral is playing in this movie as a coach. This is a G rated movie which is totally different from her ""Sex in the City"" show, rated TV/MA."
2,Boring!,I like non animated Disney movies but I couldn't even finish this one with my eyes open. It was that boring!
3,Entertaining,"Ice Princess isnt some neo Disney classic. It's predictable in the end, but the story is still sweet (and at the same time has a serious tone) The acting is solid and the ice skating is spectacular) Ice Princess is a good 1.5 hours."
2,inspring for youg girls,"I don't think the writing or the timing of the jokes was great in this movie, but Michelle Trachtenberg does a wonderful job with her role. I think the message the movie sends is that girls need positive female role models to encourage them to be strong, independent, and go for their dreams. I liked the fact that both the moms were working and not freting over their husbands not being around. I liked that the love story beween Michelle's charecter and that guy wasn't the focus of the movie, her ice skating career was the main focus!"
5,Early 80's gem rediscovered,"Big Break Records digs deep into the early 80's RCA catalog and pulls out this lost treasure from Michael Wycoff. Another case of every song being a winner here, but especially LOOKING UP TO YOU and the duet with Evelyn Champaigne King CAN WE BE FRIENDS are just great."
2,I was so disappointed,"I was really excited to receive this book, I really enjoyed Slipping Into Darkness, but this book really disappointed me. It started wonderfully with the downward spiral of John, the death of his daughter taking such an incredible toll on his life, but after that tale, the novel died. Jake was average and incredibly boring, and this is Blauner's ""hero"". I didn't even like the guy. The bad guy I'll call him, is so incredibly cliche! Gangster makes good on trapping Jake in a crime so that he can strong arm into a construction contract. Ugh. These characters were horrid, and even the wonderful character of John couldn't make up for this lackluster story and really slow developing and eventually predictable plot. Blauner missed on this one, I was utterly disppointed. I suggest that you read Slipping Into Darkness, it was wonderful and that book alone will keep me coming back to Blauner in hopes that he can recapture that magic. It didn't happen here."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This is a horrible product. There are two major problems with this poncho. The first is the hood is too small. It assumes you have no neck! Also, the hole for the head is too small for the average person. My head is not unusually large, though I do have a lot of hair; but the hole is too small even for someone with a buzz cut.Even if the hole is large enough, there is no length for the hood to each my neck. It looks so odd and is uncomfortable. The fabric that should be resting on my shoulders is making a triangular shape.What is even worse is that the fabric is not water proof! After being in the rain for more than a few minutes, water begins to leak through. I recommend you avoid this product."
5,Rain protection and emergency shelter. Cool camo,"Without a doubt an essential element for those who enjoy the charms of nature.It allows you to isolate yourself from the rain and if necessary it becomes a shelter, with just a bit of rope you would get an emergency tent.It is lightweight and easy to carry, comes in a thick plastic bag which will allow a practical and convenient transport.I love this version of camouflage as it is the most advanced.Great product and very useful."
4,Beautiful Music,This CD is fabulous! I didn't know that Coko was singing Gospel now but it's all good! Her voice is just as beautiful. You go girl!
4,"Good, but not Rucker's best work","Essentially a variant of Journey to the Center of the Earth blended with Huck Finn and Edgar A. Poe (as himself), with Rucker's usual somewhat adolescent take on relationships and sex, not to mention the bizarre. A pretty good story, just not one of Rucker's best."
2,same old same old,I thought it would be fun listening to some erotic stories. They weren't all that creative or new. I have heard some close variation of every story some place else. I have to say this book was extreamly boring.
2,o-ring durability,"the ones i have brea rather easily and dont last as long as they should, however they are really easy to pt on and off quickly"
1,Left wing misery,"I hate this show. My father bought it and loves it, he got me to watch a few shows. Yes there were a few laughs, but the left wing, anti American sentiments were hanging thick in the air.The only two patriots in the room were turned into raving lunatic buffoons by the anti American creators.I can only assume that all these glowing reviews is the left overs from the 60's hippie movement."
3,Disappointed,Received this as a Christmas gift and when I returned home and tried to play the first DVD it continually halted in the same spot of episode 3 and I could not play the rest of the DVD.
3,"Great show, bad packaging","I love the MASH tv show series and my family, especialy my 10 year old son can't stop laughing.The disk set is great with one small problem. The manufacturor packaged it in a cheap cardboardcase which results in minor surface scratches. Enough so that I had to get a disk repair kit towatch some of them. For that I deduct 2 stars because of the inherent damage from the packaging."
2,Think I got a bootleg,"Here's why I think so:1.) Product description on the back of the box indicates that a booklet comes with the box set. After opening up the product, there is no booklet.2.) Bottom surface of DVDs is clear (silver-like) as compared the the individual sets I bought years ago which are gold-like.3.) Glue on packaging did not hold.4.) Each dvd was placed into a plastic sleeve and then placed in its slot.5.) Certain DVDs were out of order in their slots.6.) Disc compression (whether played on a computer or on a standard dvd player connected to a standard TV) is horrible. Artifacts are very evident.7.) Lots of skips and pauses when discs have no scratches."
3,Laugh track?,"Does anyone know if it has a laugh track and/or if the laugh track can be turned off? I began watching Mash in Singapore which aired without the laugh track. In the US, it shows with a laugh track which I always find offensive and cannot bear it. I'll buy it if it can run without a laugh track and I will run from it otherwise. Thank you!"
1,It's packaged terribly - believe all the others' reviews.,"It is just pitiful that this really great collection is completely unusable. Not only that, I bought TWO of them, and they both arrived in the same damaged condition. I'm going to return them and hope for the best, but I've got that sinking feeling that it's going to be of no use. Two sets, neither is viewable. I doubt that I'd get lucky to find ones that ARE viewable."
3,LOVE the show - Disks are Poor Quality,"Bought these for hubby for Christmas. First go-around, about 6 of the disks have places that either hang, skip, or jar. Of course, you have to watch through them all (time consuming) to find these areas, and now it's way too late to send them back. It's GREAT for the episodes that we can get to play with little or no problems, but very annoying for the episodes that have problems."
5,Awesome collection,I love have these DVD's ready whenever I need a MASH fix. I think the canvas cover for the collection is a nice touch. My husband and I enjoy the quizzes in the bonus features.
3,Great Set & Good Price.....But...,"First off, this is a great deal on a great set of DVD disks.But..You must be extremely careful removing the disks from the hard cardboard slots, and even if you are careful you'll find that some disks have already been scratched and suffered damaged just by being inserted in those slots in the first place.If you wish to watch these disks over and over, I suggest that you do not put them back into the slots because you will just get more scratches on them.I'm storing mine individually in CD sleeves until I can purchase a 40 Disc CD Holder, or case to keep them in.I just hope that I can find something that will fit into the box I received the set in."
3,Damaged,As soon as i opened the product the cover of the movie came apart but other than that everything was all right.
3,Enraged fans - Shame on FOX,"My wife and I, like many others I see here, are enraged at FOX's decision to now offer this complete set with bonus discs while not offering the bonus material separately. We have eagerly awaited each and every season that has been released and were looking forward to completing the series when I see this. I have seen the comments made by some about how all corporations do this, and no they are not wrong. Many times over I have purchased a dvd, only to find that a 'special' version is later released. However, there is a difference between spending $20 for another dvd version and spending ~$400 for an entire season, THEN having to spend another $140 to get the extras. The fact that it has been done before does not make it right. Will we purchase this new dvd set? Being very loyal M*A*S*H fans, yes we will. We will be giving away our old series to family. But it still hurts.Rated 3: 5 Stars for M*A*S*H ... 1 Star for FOX"
1,Former Fox BuyerI,"I have to agree that Fox has gotten greedy and I had planned to buy this set just to get the extras and sell my single sets on Amazon or Ebay, but have just decided to canscel the order and not buy any more Fox releases....really am disappointed in you guys, but then I have enjoyed the series for several years and I can always pick up an old copy of the original MASH movie cheap and I find that a lot of the extras tend to get boring, but do feel Fox should offer these extra discs to those of us who have faithfully purchased each season....new at the premium price. I think the general public are not preordering this set as fast as Amazon hoped....hense the reduction in price. I imagine that I will be able to pick up a set even cheaper in about a year at one of the big chain discount brokers if I decide I have to have it afterall"
2,RIPPED OFF!,"Here's an idea for all you studio product managers: RELEASE THE ENTIRE SET WITH ALL THE BELLS & WHISTLES FIRST, THEN release the individual seasons for those who (1. cannot afford all of the seasons (2. only want individual episodes/seasons.I bought all 10 seasons and was ready to buy the final season 11 and THEN THIS COMES OUT! Hello? Who is going to re-buy all the seasons for the extra discs? NOT ME!GREAT SERIES, BUT I AM ONLY RATING THIS WITH 2 STARS FOR THE LAME IDEA FROM A LAME PRODUCT MANAGER."
1,Yet another ripped-off collector,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer; those of us who faithfully bought every season of MASH up to now ($300+) are getting abused by FOX. They want us to shell out hundreds more dollars to get the special features that we were expecting to see on the season 11 set. If FOX would have remastered the discs for better sound and picture quality, it would be worth rebuying, but all they did was put the same discs in a different box. Shame on you, FOX!"
3,Catch 22,"As many other reviewers here, yes, I'm mad at Fox too. We were buying all series, one by one as they came out. I believe that through such ""supporters"" Fox actually decided to release all series, otherwise they would abandon them just like Mad About You was abandoned after two seasons. If people wouldn't buy separate series, well there would be no box set either. I did like the other reviewer suggested; I gave them away to a friend who couldn't afford them and ordered the boxed set.I don't understand why they have to start with separate seasons for old shows - wouldn't it be easier to put the box set out to start with? If someone likes the show they would buy it.All in all: MASH 5 stars - Fox 0 stars"
2,DVD's suck,"MASH episodes are of course gr8, however the DVD doesn't continue thru. After EVERY episode you have to go back to the main menu and choose the episode you want to watch, then you have to choose to watch the episode or a particular chapter of the episode. The design sucks!"
2,"good value, poor packaging","great value, nice to have all the seasons in one convenient case...BUT the storage leaves much to be desired. The disks are stored in cardboard sleeves, so by the time I got them, a lot of the disks were already scuffed and pause/skip when played."
4,M*A*S*H martinis and medicine,"Of course, the series itself is great-they are the same DVDs as in the individual seasons; however, the packaging scratches the DVDs, so we had to buy a normal CD portfolio to keep them safe. Otherwise, it is great to have all the seasons, the movie, and two DVDs with special features all together."
4,"Great Show, Sub-par packaging","I love MASH, and you really do get all of the MASH you want with this set, but the box that it comes in is not really all that great. The package has cardboard slip-in slots that you store the movies in, which can be hazardous to the discs, if you're pulling them out and putting them back a lot. If you're truly concerned about it, you could buy one of those cd-book/binder things to store the discs in instead of using the canvas-covered box."
5,MASH- My very favorite series,This is so enjoyable for me. Up until now I was always going to the library to get different seasons and I would only have 1 week to watch them. Now I can watch whenever there is nothing on TV. Great stuff.
2,"Great Show, Bad Packaging","Do not buy this product. As everyone says below, the disks will be scratched when you take them out.MASH is a great show, but this packaging is as bad as it gets. Too bad, because I was really looking forward to watching them."
2,poor packaging,"I'm sure the set is fine; I give it two stars because the packaging was so poorly designed that the cardboard arcs in the disc 2 and 3 slots for each season left identical perfect arcs dented into the discs, making it unwatchable; we just sent it back and bought the rest of the seasons we needed separately. This type of packaging also makes it difficult to remove and replace the discs without scuffing them. Maybe our situation was unique, or the seller had too many things stacked on top of the set so it got pressed into the arcs, but it wasn't worth the risk to try another set."
3,Bear Mountain,"More like a children's book in that believing a bear sculpture could have that much influence on people. Long, drawn out story to a fairly obvious conclusion."
2,not my kind of story,this book was not an easy read for me. it was quite boring and i couldnt really follow what the point of the story was.
1,byzantine silver and onyx bracelet,I was very disappointed in this purchase. It looked more like a man's bracelet. I returned the item.
4,Underrated wispy-wavy music!,"This CD seems to have gone unnoticed by the mainstream who seem only to remember ""Melt with you""...this album is really strong, definitely at least as good as After the Snow...Rainbows End, Machines, Spinning Me Round, Blue Waves are all extremely excellent, and the remaining tracks are almost as good as they (I enjoy turning the volume up during the sweet little classical intro to Chapter 12 too)....I love to discover unheralded gems, and this CD certainly fits the bill. If you enjoy ME's more popular music, please give this album a try. You'll be pleasantly surprised!"
4,Pop with punch,"Very nice album. I bought it upon release in 1992 and still find myself still listening to it after 10+ years. If you enjoy melodic, catchy synth-pop a la Human League and later Stranglers releases, by all means purchase this CD.The title track (with it's circular chorus) and 'Rainbow End' are my favorites.Enjoy!"
2,test of time,"the true greatness of any album is listening to it a decade later. Now two decades later, having given the album another listen, it's nearly forgettable. Hands across the sea is the gem. download the single song and spare yourself the balance of the tab."
4,. . . It's A Super Cat,"Is there species discrimination afoot in the persistent belief that cats are not loving, loyal, understood? Well, James Herriot in his delightfully insightful, poignant Cat Stories gives convincing, witty accounts that cats can and do live a dog's life. Case in point is Buster, a feline retriever who loves to play catch. Want heroics worthy of Lassie and Rin-Tin_Tin? Read about Debbie, a stray cat who assures her offspring a good home as a Christmas president to the kitten and the human who adopts it. Herriot's relationship with his own cats-Olly and Ginny-is a heart-warming leitmotif of the book as he utilizes all of his skills as a compassionate veterinarian to provide for this wild duo."
4,Heartwarming Stories,"In this book we meet Olly and Ginny, feral kittens who disdained indoor life. Frisks's ``spells'' were a puzzle until Herriot learned that the cat licked the medicine saucer of its owner, a terminal cancer patient. Oscar, an injured stray was notable for attending public meetings. Moses, a black kitten, joined a litter of pigs and was accepted by the sow. These heartwarming stories should make an ideal gift for cat lovers."
1,Won't Play,"I tried to use this DVD today, and it won't play in my machine. I tried it on our laptop, and that didn't work either. Very disappointed."
5,A book for any seeker of life knowledge,"This book answers the questions of life that thousands of books, particularly in this 'new age' don't.It can't be read like a typical book. It is hard to just pick up and read cover to cover and get much from it. You need to take it slowly and digest the wisdom in it.Even a single sentence can sometimes take a while to absorb.Be patient and this companion will open a new way of thinking for you."
4,This caliper has an excellent computer interface,"For those who are connecting their calipers to a digital readout, like a Sumatech or Yadro, these are perfect. They use the original Chinese communications standard and all functions work correctly. These calipers still use crystal controlled electronics, unlike those I've inspected that use the newer communications standard.I believe that is the reason I get poor comm performance out of them.For those who are just using these as calipers, these are only average in construction. The main beam on one of my examples is slightly bowed, a common issue with the cheaper calipers. This does not appear to affect accuracy, but a perfectionist will likely be disappointed."
1,Didn't work out of the box.,"When this arrived, I noticed right away it only had one scale on the rule, metric, in large simple numbering and crude scaling, NOT the dual SAE and Metric like in the photos.I tried turning it on, nothing. Tried the new battery it comes with as a spare--and the digital read out came on for a few seconds, not giving any useful measurement information. Then the liquid crystal display kind of fluttered and froze up. I checked the instructions, which are crudely translated english, and found them to be worthless for troubleshooting this problem.Putting some finger pressure on the battery case would cause the LCD screen to flicker a bit, but nothing.The calipers then went back in the case, then in the box and off to the post office for a return..."
2,Not really,"I expected this CD, produced by Cubans in Miami, to be that great, slick Cuban sound of the 50's and 60's. Instead it is really slick elevator music and not much else. If you have a dentists office and want to tranquilize your patients, this is the album for you...otherwise zzzzz."
1,It's a pretty picture book...,I bought this guide and found that everything in it is exactly what I could have figured out on my own. No PokeDex and nothing about breeding pokemon except one lousy sentence. This guide is horrible! Buy a Prima or Nintendo guide instead if you want helpful information. This book is a dud...
5,OUTSTANDING,"This book is a must-have for anyone interested in linguistics, and particularly the social aspects of linguistics. Written by a true expert in the field, the book covers a wide area of its topic and yet still has enough detail (with examples) to back up all the ideas and theories. Includes incorporation of gender preconceptions in speech, power roles in speech, and language construction as it relates to social issues, as well as information on media bias using linguistic techniques.In this book were many ideas that I'd never even thought about before - it was used as the textbook for what I consider to be the most interesting, engaging course I've taken at the undergraduate level (and it's not even in my major). This is the type of textbook that I would read for personal enjoyment even if I hadn't taken the class - and probably wouldn't be able to put down until I'd finished."
4,Tuva meets the Velvets,"This is a weird one: Tuvan throat singing merged with slow, electrified folk/blues arrangements, and a dark tinge of difficult-listening art-rock. There's a strong influence (whether conscious or not) of the Velvet Underground, particularly with the presence of a droning string instrument, rather similar to John Cale's early abrasions with the VUs. If you crave unusual albums, this is one worth tracking down."
1,Amateurish tripe,"A ghastly waste of time. It tried to shock me, but I kept getting bored and wandering off for a cup of coffee. I really can't think of anyone who'd give a damn about this one..."
2,Expected more,"This is the first of her novels that I read, and I have to say that I expected more. The characters are weakly drawn, and maybe because I'm not English, I didn't understand their motivations. In addition I didn't like any of the characters, and couldn't identify with them. It was also very very depressing."
1,Supernova Blu-ray,"I was really enjoying this movie when it suddenly ended in the middle of the story and said ""TO BE CONTINUED"" You do not have any sequel available at this time. I would not recommend it unless the entire movie could be purchased/"
5,Left Behind Second Series,"LEFT BEHIND Second Chance By Jerry B. Jenkins This book is GREAT if you're a Christian for a belief. I loved this book because it has an excellent use of language and has you sitting on the edge of your seat for the next exciting chapter to begin. This book is realistic fiction. The characters are Jud, Vicky, Ryan and Lionel. You will be upset at some times but it will clear up. I enjoyed this book so much. I hope will if u read it."
5,Kids love these!,I had a small church library for the kids and I have to say that these books by far are the most popular with kids of all ages! They can't seem to get enough of the left behind series!
5,i love this,My husband will not wear any others! He is very particular about the sunglasses he wears. He loves these sunglasses
3,Sunglasses hurt ears,"Had to return the sunglasses...they REALLY hurt my ears. Unfortunately, there was a Re-stocking fee that I didn't know about...sigh."
4,Glory of MASH,A fabulous end to ther series and to answer many peoples' questions the final episode is on the last disc. It was well worth the price and I couldnt have gone without the end of the series
1,Errare Humanum Est,"The definition of Baud Rate, as given in Chapter 7, under Dial-Up Access (Page 103), is wrong. Baud (or Baud rate) is the number of times a signal changes its state in one second (e.g. voltage). For details, see Computer Networks by A.S. Tanenbaum."
2,Da Vinci Review,"I had hoped to use this in an advanced glass for gifted students, grades 2-6, but couldn't--too much violence, did not focus enough on Da Vinci's art."
5,Good swing.,Very good remastering. The pinguin jazz guide give to it the best mention. When we listen to this album we undertand wy. An essentiel...
4,A Wigged-Out War Adventure,"I knew this would be a fantastic story, for what could be more outrageous than a 26 year old skater, directionless and without abmbition, who enlists and goes to war? Buzzell's memoir starts out funny, and stays that way throughout. It's amazing that he was able to publish an internet diary with anti-war messages. You'd think the brass would ruin him for that. But then again, maybe the guys at the top wanted to write this sort of thing?I could only give it 4 starts because there is enough material in here for several books. I would like to see a full vollume on his pre-war life, hopping from state-to-state and job to job. After that, there should be a book on his post-war experiences."
2,Frustrating Read,"This book is a frustrating read. Colby Buzzell is an incredibly gifted writer. Incredibly. But he has chosen to write a very superficial account of the small world of, well, Colby Buzzell. There are occasional glimpses of a much more thoughtful, obervant side; it's hard to figure why Buzzell sets the bar so low for himself here.Anyone looking for a ground warrior's insight and experience in Iraq may want to skip this book. There are better accounts avialable now and history suggests the best are yet to come.Don't skip Colby Buzzell, though. Read one of his shorter pieces (in the March 2006 Esquire, for example) to appreciate his talent, and keep your eye on him in the future."
1,Single worst product I've purchased,"I saw there were some issues with this with the number dial locking. This happened to me but I used a screwdriver and hammer to pop it into motion which worked well and since then the dials rotated ok. I was patient with it but was un-prepared for what was about to come... The outer plastic protective sheath which rotated to protect the dials swelled and now it won't move. I cut into it to relieve some of the tightness and wrestled with the dial again, this time with the release switch. I finally opened it and realized there was spot rust on the steel of the u shaped portion. I mean WTF, this does not seem like a complicated product to engineer and I only had it for like 4 months! I literally had a GROUP of issues with this product and wonder if I will even be able to release my bike next time I try to. I'm literally stunned."
2,stolen,"left over night in nyc and found the u bent. bike gone. i was happy with the price and lock until this happened. also, the pad is tough to see in the dark"
1,Malfunctioned - easily bypassed with bolt cutters,"I owned this lock for about 30 days. It was used for four lock - unlock cycles in that time. On its final voyage to the university bike rack, one of the tumblers failed and I could not disengage the lock. I emailed Kryptonite customer service and have yet to receive a response. I had to cut the lock off because I need my bike. Here is the real surprise, it took less than 45 seconds to cut the lock with a decent 24"" bolt cutter. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.In short this product receives 1 star for three reasons:1. Lock failed after 4 use cycles2. Lock is bypassed in 45 seconds with bolt cutters3. Kryptonite support is poor and potentially non-existant"
1,Not Flood Safe!,"5 weeks after installing the Watts Flood Safe supply line it broke at between the supply connection and the anti-flood valve. The product itself created a flood. Of course, according to the warranty, they will replace the product, but not take responsibility for the damage they did. I would never install another of these lines - never, never, never!"
4,An excellent adventure.,"This is the first time I see two heroes team against two villains who instead of plotting together are destroying each other. All characters are true to their nature. Green Lantern is Kyle Rayner who is still new to the power he has inherited, Thanos as always is scheming manipulator, Parallax is still obsessed with resurrecting the dead and the Surfer is the Surfer. Each hero finds himselves teaming with the other's arch enemy and the interaction is wonderful. The only thing I hate about this book is that this begins the new fact that the DC and Marvel Universes are separate and distinct and that the inhabitants of either universe will have to find a way to go to the other universe. Does this invalidate previous DC/Marvel teamings? It sure feels that way. The story is good and the separate universe theory worked for it, it's just that it opens a can of worms when the theory doesn't work out well."
4,The slippers are great,Leather is great quality and the slipper comfortable They would be even better if the sole were a little thicker.
1,Not substantial enough,"You may have to find out where she goes to church, eats out, clubs she frequents, or park where she jogs, but DO NOT STALK HER"" What a contradiction. The club.......express that you really glad to have met her and remember, do not ask her for her number"" What kind of advice is that. Of course you ask for the digits, you got to show iniative and interest. I mean what are the chances you'll really see her again......why blow the opportunity."
4,Pretty Darn Funny,"Same ol' same ol' Family Guy...The humor is still there, still have to love Stewie. In a month, the next volume comes out, can't wait!!!"
5,A must-own for any older Family Guy fan,"The entire cast is represented in theis delightful boxed-set. If you're a true fan, you need to add this to your collection. Younger viewers tend to be repititious in their viewing habits, so I wouldn't recommend this as a gift for them. It's young-adult and adult humor."
4,It's wrong to split seasons up like this.,"I love the episodes, they are hilarious as every fan knows. The problem is the split seasons on dvd. They could easily fit an entire season into one set, but they choose not to so they can sell us two sets per season and squeeze more money out of the fans. They lose one star for being GREEDY, GREEDY, GREEDY."
4,review Family Guy,This was purchased as a gift and it has been enjoyed since. It is not for children but as adults we have had many laughs.
1,Fox is pathetic,The 1 star is to Fox for splitting Season 4 into two separate volumes. What a rip off. 14 episodes? How about the whole season?!!?!?!?!? The season was cut in half but the price wasn't?!?!?!I'm done purchasing Family Guy. Fox's pathetic attempt to squeeze every last penny out of people by splitting season 4 into two releases is unnacceptable. There are plenty of other places I can waste my money.
5,Great Flick with Tremendous Heart!,"TV & film veteran Christine Lahti (Chicago Hope et.al.)portrays courageous & determined lawyer, Grace Cragin, in this David & Goliath tale of standing up for the common man and holding ""the Big Guy"" accountable. Grace is a former Wall Street attorney still recovering from the loss of the colossal Exxon case in the mid-80s and her failed marriage to the love of her life, ex-husband Henry (Terry O'Quinn, Lost et al). Six years later, Grace is a practicing lawyer & partner in a small town firm & a former law professor, who has resigned herself to a challenge-free, easy going existence until a young man she loves falls victim to cancer.Everything changes when Grace finds herself taking on the tobacco industry with the support of her ex-hubby--who is also trying to make amends--and their grown children.This is an inspiration film with a great cast & terrific heart!!"
1,UGLY,I WOULD NOT GET THIS AT ALL SAFE YOUR MONEY....WHEN I GOT THIS I WAS EXPECTING IT FIRST OF ALL TO BE PINK AS IT SAYS...IT CAME IN BROWN AND IT WAS DIRTY ...AND TO MAKE IT CLEAR BECAUSE SOMETHING I JUST DIDNT REALIZE THIS DOES NOT MOVE WITH WATER FLOW SO IF THAT IS SOMETHING YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THIS WOULD NOT BE IT ... I RETURNED THE PRODUCT THE DAY I GOT IT
5,Great value with lots of choices,"Overall it's a great value. Lots of hexes to use, easy color coded oversized container. I bought one for my shooting bag, now I'm thinking of adding a few more of these to all my tool boxes. It's great to have a large selection of hexes for when you encounter those bolts that have them."
3,Not ergonomically comfortable,"I bought these for my husband, hopeful that they would provide a handier way to put together and adjust the plethora of kids furniture and toys we have around our house. These are MUCH easier to use than a traditional Allen wrench but I was a little disappointed in them. The handle is not very comfortable to hold and each time you open up one to use you have to tighten the bolt at the base of the tool to keep that wrench in place. I expected them to lock into place similar to a pocket knife. You have to be careful not to use too much pressure like you would when using a screw driver because the wrench could start to fold back up. Even though this wasn't exactly what I expected I still think it's a good value and a better alternative than the traditional Allen wrench. They're compact and have all the sizes we need. This set is good for the common household projects that we will need it for."
5,Tough Little Hex Wrenches,I use these hex and torx wrenches very often at work. I've put them under very hard force to remove some corroded hex nuts and they've held up well. The steel hasn't rounded and is very strong. Color coded makes it easy to find and they fold out easy. A really good American made tool.
2,"I Am A Huge Fan Of Hilary Duff, But...","I don't really like the song. Here is my opinion:1. Little Voice (0/5) - I don't like this song.2. Party Up (Remix) (5/5) - I haven't heard this version, but the original rocks!"
3,Okay Song,I Love Hilary but i was mad because i like the song but the singles i want are my faves on da CD Workin it out and The mathbut i still love Hilary
5,Purse Sized.,"I love these little books. They are small and I think would fit in any purse. The William Morris notebook is unlined, but not all are, you have to check the product descripton. I use this for a food diary, and have one tucked into my bedside table. They are eligible for the 4-for-3 discout, and they only cost $1.50 to begin with so they are a steal! I plan on stocking up to have on hand for gift bags and Christmas stockings."
1,NO ACCESS to mydevelopmentlab.com,"Please be aware that despite the editorial review describing ""mydevelopmentlab,"" a multimedia program that is meant to accompany this textbook, the edition offered here does not come either with the CD-ROM version of the program or with access to the online version. My rating of 1 star has nothing to do with the content of the textbook, only with the misleading nature of the editorial review."
5,lots of relief,"Before getting this, I was starting to limit the length of my walks with the dog and was so uncomfortable by the end of the day that I often iced. This is discomfort that no one tells you about during pregnancy! Although it's tight (to do its job) and not terribly comfortable, it gives so much comfort and relief from swelling that it's 5 stars! I'm still walking the dog 5 miles a day at 36 weeks pregnant, with no discomfort! BTW, this product is the same -- as far as i can tell -- as the prenatal cradle.)"
4,Love-Hate Relationship,"The V2 Supporter and I have a love-hate relationship. I love that it supports my vulvar vericosies and falling out/bulging feeling. It works wonders. I hate that it makes the worst panty-lines in the world, although when you are in so much discomfort who gives a crap about the panty-lines! I found that the newer version folds over at the top band which drives me to tears because I bought a pair a month ago and it has a nice thick top elastic band that doesn't fold over! I just wanted a pair to wear while I hand wash the other because you really can't turn back once you've felt the support of this thing. I found that the velcro tabs in the butt area poke, so I snipped the very tips of the corners off and I don't have a problem now. Good luck I totally recommend the V2 Supporter for Pregnant ladies with vein problems or the falling-out-the-groin feeling. It really has helped me!"
1,Uncomfortable,"I think this product would be better if there was one more size to chose from. According to the size chart I was a size large, but it actually caused me more pain than I was already experiencing. An XL would be so helpful! I ended up returning the product with no issues from seller - they were easy to work with."
3,K81DJ Pros and Cons,"I bought these headphones with the intentions of using them with my Headroom Bitamp, but the amplifier overwhelmed my speakers. Now i have a pair of K81 Dj with no sound. and it took nearly 2 weeks for this incident to happen.If you are going to use these headphones with out an amplifier then they are the best you can get for this price. amazing sound and punchy bass.some people might of had other experiences, but mine wasn't a good one with this product."
1,Audiophile,"This headphone is unnatural sounding; very colored sound; not neutral sounding, bass is to heavy.Headphone not comfortable.AKG Closed-Back Foldable DJ Headphones - K81DJ"
4,Fun time adventure...,Well there are some rather corny scenes. But these are just fun movies to kick back and watch every once in awhile.
1,theft,"This book is a copy of Culture Shock! Thailand, A Guide to Customs and Etiquette, published by Times Editions, Singapore, first in 1982 and regularly updated. Rights to produce a US version of one edition of Culture Shock Thailand were sold to Kuperard years ago, this did not give them the right to reproduce the book with minimal changes. A great pity Amazon carries such theft."
4,Kenso - A Solid Album,"I don't really know a whole lot about this album. It was released in 2002, but there are dates of 1991 and 2001 on the back of the album so I am not sure if this is a compilation or new studio stuff. It is recorded a lot better than ""Esoptron"" which is a good thing. The material is instrumental progressive rock with a major fusion influence. The band's two keyboardists are prominent in the mix along with Shimzu's guitar. This is another strong effort from Kenso as the band continues to evolve. I don't think it is their best album, but it is defiantly worth owning."
2,"""The Story is Hard to Find""","There is a story embedded in this film, but it's largely overwhelmed by endless scenes of praying, praising and preaching. I'm not trying to disparage religion, but potential viewers should know beforehand what they're in for."
5,I like this,"I just realized I still lacked one more to complete my set, but it has been ordered. The delivery was timely and I am happy with the item I got."
5,Sturdy and sizeable!,"My turtle loves her new ramp! It sticks to the glass with no problem and she loves jumping from the top ledge into the water. Easy to clean and has lots of room as well! I prefer these ramps over magnetic docks that my turtle would struggle to get on. Now she has no problem walking up her dock, sometimes just sunning her face :)"
4,Biography of Cassius Clay,"This vintage book was purchased to support the archival collections at the Abraham Lincoln Library and Museum on Cassius Clay. This work, though dated, does well in providing a balanced biogaphy. Clay's extream idealism comes through well. Especially useful is Smiley's narrative of Clay's recognition of the mountain region as a potential abolitionist support base in Kentucky. This is an early admission of the split nature of Southern political geography. Smiley does talk a bit on his work in Russia, but I had wished it was in much more detail."
3,THEE Ravenlost Campaign Novel,"This is absolutely thee most talked about and priased campaign novel by defunct TSR, and my first D & D product I've purchased since TSR was bought out by Wizards of the Coast. This here novel I Strahd is on a level with Anne Rice as it adds just the right amount of trailer trash to a romanticized dark and brooding gothic atmosphere. Count Strahd Von Zarovich is the lord of D & D's Ravenlost campaign. There's a lot more to get out of Ravenloft than ghost busting and vampire hunting. It's for people who whimped or junkied out on Dragonlance. I give the book 3 stars for Wizards of the Coast's attempt at making it a legitimate paperback epic vampire novel, and not just another throwaway D & D product. I picked Ravenlost as my paladin's campaign because of the cliched gothic elements, and not just more gods and monsters like Forgotten Realms or Dragonlance. I liked it. Peace."
1,Shuts Off All The Time *Don't Buy It,"I purchased (3) of these from the Euro-Pro site after I seen them on their infomercial. I was charged for all (3) and they only shipped me (1)I have contacted them and am still waiting (2 mos)now. I asked them to email me when the other 2 would be shipped but they don't do that. If you email them they DON'T ANSWER. I am glad only 1 was shipped so I can contact my CC Co. because I wouldn't give them as a gift now that I have used mine. This Vac SHUTS OFF after a few minutes of use ALL THE TIME. I don't care what they tell you to do, it will continue to shut itself off because it gets to HOT. I think Euro-Pro jumped the gun on this Vac and we are the guinea pigs for their mistake! Don't waste your money, I can't even get my bedroom done and it shuts off. I almost burned my leg on it too. Hopefully I will get a refund for the 2 not shipped. I wouldn't give this to anyone. It does clean good but this needs to be revamped so it runs correctly."
3,some drawback but picks up fleas,"This vacuum has to emptied and cleaned frequently to run well. The filters are somwhat expensive and need to be washed. However, when the fleas start to jump on the dog and make themselves at home in my house other vacuums just don't seem to have the same power of eviction. The dog stops scratching."
4,Pretty Amazing,"I have owned the prior model, EP601, for at least 5 years. I actually can't remember when I got it. I'm still using the original filter; the replacement one is around somewhere but I never felt the need to change it. The thing has suffered incredible abuse and has been knocked and smashed in countless ways. Yet it still works great. I'm looking to replace it with the newer model only because the cracks, splashed paint, and melted plastic parts (I leaned it up against a radiator one too many times) make it look like garbage. I have to give kudos for a very small, very powerful vac at a very reasonable price. Anyway, I hope the newer EP602 is equally robust."
3,Good for auto detailing,"This little machine is not much good as a household vacuum. The main problem is that it has no agitator. It won't clean carpets very well at all. It does have pretty good suction, so it does a decent job on hard surfaces but the dust cup is rather small so it probably won't handle a whole room.On the other hand, it's better than a dust buster. It has better suction and more flexibility. As long as you don't expect it to replace your regular vacuum, it's pretty useful. The best use I've found for it is in my car. After I use the shop vac to clean the seats and carpets, I can use the small tools from the Euro-pro to get into those little crevices between the seats.I give it three stars because it only does a really good job on that single task. I have also used it to vacuum stairs, where it's portability is an asset, but it's only moderately effective there."
1,Unreliable - I wouldn't buy this again,"This vacuum cleaner has the following problems:1) It overheats and stops working after a few minutes of use. It starts working again after several minutes therefore don't expect to use it for more than 5-10 min at a time.2) Dust gets stuck on its bottom surface so you have to wipe it often so it works properly3) After about 9 months it broke and the bottom part keeps coming out very easily4) It's obvious, but it has very low power and it is annoying to use.It has a good price and convenient size but after all these problems I am now looking to buy a different vacuum."
2,So-so product,"I received this vacuum 14 months ago and while, technically, it still works, it is falling apart. The handle keeps twirling around (something inside isn't locking anymore) and the bottom has fallen off. I use it only for hardwood floors as it is HORRIBLE on carpets/rugs. Does a decent job on hardwood floors but the doghair gets caught in the small rollers. Not sure I'd buy again, but can't seem to find another inexpensive, lightweight vacuum. Will keep searching though!"
1,Waste of Money and Time.,Ordered this and its total garbage for the U.S..The video itself is says 2009 but the footage is from like the 70's or 80's and itsall narrated by a heavily accented english guy (Bob Symes)complete rubbish if your looking to get ideas or 'railfan' layouts.
4,feel good movie from downunder,"This movie was fun to watch and left us with a great feeling. We love movies with child actors and the cast of this film held up well to Berry and Belushi. The power of ""can do"" is infectious!"
1,Cheaply made. Broke immediately.,"Plate hangers used to be made of malleable wire, able to last for years. A simple slight bend of these to adjust them to fit breaks the thin extruded wire. I would not trust these to hang any ceramic plate of 11 to 18."" I got my money back. If you have a priceless piece to display, don't trust them to a cheaply made $6 item."
3,Beautiful but....,"I was really excited to receive this bracelet in the mail. It's beautiful, smaller than it looks in the picture and a simple addition to any outfit. Unfortunately, it broke about a month after wearing it. The clasp snapped & I am unable to wear it anymore. I would've given this item a higher rating if lasted longer."
5,Best tool I've bought in years!,"A wonderful addition to your drill/driver collection!! Small and extremely well-balanced, this little gem gives you maximum power with minimum exertion. I have pretty bad carpal tunnel and bought this on the recommendation of a doctor/woodworker friend -- very, very glad I did! Side note: I am a fairly loyal Bosch buyer -- have not historically thought all that much of Makita hand power tools. This impact driver is so well designed and built that I've reconsidered -- since bought the MForce 12 volt drill and the 6"" ro sander and am delighted with both. Thank you Makita!"
5,my new favorite santana album,i can't find one reason not to like this cd. in my opinion it is pure perfection. santana has done it again......rm
3,"Skillet is alright, but not the most solid album ever","I bought Skillet based upon the track Whispers in the Dark and I have to say I was not as impressed with the rest of the album. I was waiting for a very solid album and I received mediocre. It is not a bad album, but never going to be a classic. If you have the extra money and are into lighter rock, pick it up as an occasional listener. Not a constant player on my iPod, but decent."
1,i am so tired,"I have been a longtime skillet fan, and i am so shocked by all the reviews for this album. Ever since Skillet got a tad bit of mainstream success a few years ago, i have been so over this band.But when I heard Rebirth, I became interested in Skillet again. But when I bought this album, I quickly got tired of them again. John Cooper (Lead Singer) is married to keyboardist (Korey Cooper) and yet the album is all about broken relationships. So does that mean that the married couple is having trouble and just staying together for the band or what. I am so confused by that, and then I remembered if anyone christian band wants to be a secular artist it is Skillet, and I just figured they're trying to be more mainstream.If anyone knows anything about the Skillet history, you know that they just keep jumping from genre to genre and this guy here won't buy into it again."
2,Help for Caregivers,"As a Registered Nurse, and now, sadly. a caregiver to my own husband, i was disappointed with this book. Perhaps it would be more helpful for someone distanced from ""actual"" 24/7 caregiving. - like a hospice worker who has never actually been a caregiver to a loved one."
5,Read to absorb,"I have read this book a few times. It is not one that you should do in one or two settings..it is a book to be your companion and as such, should be absorbed rather than read. Over the past six years I have probably bought about 30-40 of these for friends, nurse staff that I have walked alongside, as well as strangers whom I felt would identify with these writings. My last purchase, which is prompting this review, was for a person I met while volunteering with Habitat for Humanity in Louisiana. This person is now a surgical medical student who wants to be an oncology surgeon. I thought the book would compliment this person's compassion and understanding of the pursuit of medical/surgical oncology. I figure, as long as this book is in print, I will continue to buy it and pass it on. Skip DM, BCC (Chaplain)"
3,As comforting as a cup of tea on a rainy day,"This book was an easy and comforting read. I can highly recommend it if you are caring for someone who is terminally ill. It gives a very gracious and encouraging picture of the final months and days. The analogy of ""May I walk you home"" will stay with you long after you put the book down. It's also a great read for those who support the caregivers who support the ill."
3,Very good for Freshman outing,"""Standoff"" takes the reader through a wild ride of hostage negotiation with all the bureaucracy that involves. From the local police, sheriff, US Marshalls, FBI agents, and every law enforcement agency in between, you really get an understanding of what must happen in these tense, unpredictable situations.The story is told from the law's point of view throughout, and gives a good characterization of the politics of the agencies tugging and pulling for authority, attempting to work together in an explosive environment.Hogan writes his main character, John Banish, well, although most of the supporting cast are underdeveloped. I would have liked to see him give more insight into the other side of the situation - the motivation of the hostage-taker is alluded to, but never dealt with in depth.Overall, a suspenseful tale that kept me interested; and quite an achievement for a first time writer!"
2,False Rebate,"The only reason I am not putting this product as a 1-star because the product is actually good. However, 50% of the reason I bought this product instead of another manufacturer was because of the proposed rebate. The company is ridiculous because I send not only the UPC codes they require, but the entire box, and they send me a letter that they need the UPC codes. Obviously I don't have it because I sent it already. Try not to buy from Bosch. I already emailed and Facebook-ed my friends in case they ever buy something for their cars. Rebates are usually easily follow-the-instruction deals, but this is the bad side about rebates because companies can screw you over and there's no recourse for you."
3,Bosch Platinum IR Fusion = SMOOTH ride but...,"Replaced in to my 2005 HONDA Cr-V. Smooth engine firing and acceleration power immediately noticeable. I monitored the fuel consumption, before and after installation. I found out that fuel efficiency went down, understandably, due to ""increase"" in power. See below:Before installation: 19.99 MPG (average)After installation: 18.54 MPG (average)where MPG = miles per gallon of 87% octane gasoline.Overall..happy with the new performance."
1,"Don't waste your time or money like I did. Junk, all hype","Do not buy Bosch Plugs. I just got these for my 07 Ford Focus. The old plugs were original and had 99K on them, they were really worn out. These new plugs look cool and are supposed to be a huge upgrade over factory plugs. There is no upgrade, I think it's a bit of a downgrade even from the worn out factory plugs. The factory plugs look to be NGK iridiums. The whole 4 prong thing is stupid hype and does nothing to increase power or performance.The car appears to accelerate a bit smoother but slower. And when decelerating at faster speeds the engine appears to ""misfire"" because you can feel it ""shimmy"".I can't believe I wasted 30 some bucks on these pieces of junk.This is the second time I have been burned by Bosch Plugs, they were junk in my 01 Civic too."
5,A great buy!,"Excellent C.D.! Nice variety of songs. Nothing negative to say. I love this guys music. If you're a Jim Brickman fan as I am, you won't be disappointed."
5,beautiful fiction,"This is one of the finest works of fiction that I have read in quite a while. Usually I do not read ""lesbian"" fiction as I take my disappointment with the writing much too personally. This book is so painfully sad, and yet so beautifully evocative that I rank it among my favorites of all authors. This writer - new to me with this read - is outstanding - and I am ordering her other books. (that much was written in 2000)(Now an update) - December, 2004 - having read almost everything this author has written, I must say that she is indeed a talent, uneven at times - but how many authors have you read recently whose work isn't uneven at times? Slammerkin was fun. Emma (and now, having read almost all you've written, I believe I can address you by your given name) - please explore the dark side again. You have a strangely powerful, even erotic language of loss."
3,Killer Inside Me,Bursting with fruity flavours...this book has the distinction of beingmy all-time favourite Dead Milkmenlyric reference. And there you go.
5,My Favorite Thompson Story.,"I believe I've read all of Jim's fiction and even his autobiography ""Roughneck"". Killer Inside Me is easily my favorite.Jim has a refreshingly raw sence of humor. His writing style is hard for some to follow but for those who don't mind or bear with it usually finish his noveloes in the first night.I highly recommend this book for the newly inducted thompson reader. When you've become a fan move on to ""The Grifters"", ""Savage Night"" or ""A Hell of a Women"" (my personnal top 4 Thompsons)."
2,Dated,"That it was written a ""long time ago"" is not the issue as much as the fact that it simply hasn't held up, unlike, say, 'A Catcher in the Rye.' Sometimes the slang is so alien that it distracts you from the meaning. The story isn't that interesting, anyway. It was probably more effective during its time."
2,Not as good as people praised,"I read the reviews then got the book and read it. Actually, it's quite illogically written. All the killings are ridiculous. A small city population under fifty thousand, the deputy sheriff is a killer? The guy doesn't look like a cop in the first place albeit a serial killer. This is the first time I've read a serial killer who just kills those familiar folks around him. The scenario becomes even more ridiculous when he kills and kills again and again, senselessly and violently, all the other to-protect-and-serve colleague are just like a bunch of helpless morons only respond to the order of a local businessman, not a mob guy, not a politician, just a filthy businessman? Are we talking about an ancient Texan community or what? To me, this book is just a time-wasting read, no matter what other people said."
2,The movie was better!,One of the rare times in all my years of reading that I thought the novel was not as good as the film.
5,Made In Paris,"Better than Made In Japan by any measure. Brilliant, seasoned, virtuoso musicians playing as a tight, cohesive unit. No noodling or other time wasting as on Made In Japan and other DP live recordings of that era.The brilliant Morse/Lord duels rank among the best of the best; in fact any of the solos by these two rank among the best of the best. Morse breathed new life and enthusiasm into a great but declining band, prompting the attainment of new artistic heights."
2,Bring Back The Demon,Gene has lost his lust for Rock. It's all about the dollar and not the music. This collection of songs has a few highlights but not something that I'll listen to very much at all.
3,need a good book read this one,this book was really intresting and i didn't think i would enjoy it but it was great. One those books you have to read a little into it before it gets good
5,Great first effort for promising new author,"I was lucky enough to get an advanced review copy of this book and thoroughly enjoyed it. Hackler Staley is a fascinating character who I hope we'll be seeing again soon in some follow up prequels. This book is particularly timely in it's subject matter, with the recent Presidential election.If you're lucky enough to run across this book here or in a book store, take my advice and pick it up. I think you'll find it hard to put down. I know I did. One note: Amazon has this listed as a paperback. It's actually a hardback. While I still think it would be worth it; a $26 paperback might be kind of a stretch.This is a great intro to the exploits of a new cloak and dagger hero along the lines of Jason Bourne. Give it a shot. You won't be disappointed."
4,Excellent book!,"It's almost a cliche but the key to doing well in business is knowing what your customer wants. I've read that line in a ton of business books but this book is the first I've ever seen that actually tells you how to do it! Zhivago gives very practical advice on how to quickly and easily figure out what your customer will pay for -- and thus which direction you should point your business. My only gripe with this book is there's no index. Still, an excellent book which I highly recommend!!!!"
5,Celine Dion-1982-1988 Collection,"I love this album,Celine's youthful voice is the most beautiful,smooth & powerful of all.The type of music suits her best as it relays her life story.I love them all from the mellow to tempo.Eddy Marnay was heaven-sent for Celine for creating these songs.I play this CD all the time.I purchased some as a gift."
2,Wasn't What I Expected,"When I bought this I thought it was going to be simply a modernized version of Andrew Murray's edition. I now find that Dave Hunt ""draws upon several of Law's other books, including his well-known ""A Serious Call..."".When I buy a book, I don't need the editors idea of ""improving"" it. I want the book as it was written. I would not buy this book again regardless of how ""good"" it is because it isn't authentic. Very unhappy. (I've read ""A Serious Call"" and loved it.) If anyone can tell me of a legitimate copy of this book I would appreciate it."
2,"Good book, terrible printing","This is a good book, although I would not recommend it as an introduction to the subject. If you're not already familiar with the characters and events to some degree, you'll just be lost, because he doesn't refer to specifics too often. It deals in generalizations and large sweeps. And it's no good for research for the same reason. What it's good for is in helping those of us who already have some familiarity with the subject to see it in a new way, and to draw connections that probably escaped us. The value of the book is in the perspective of an accomplished and perceptive expert that it provides.Sadly, the quality of the printing in this Penguin edition is absolutely deplorable. It is the worst I have ever seen. It looks like a bad photocopy. Apparently Penguin is too cheap to reset the type, and is using plates that should have been thrown out long ago. Buy a used copy. Don't patronize Penguin for producing such a shoddy product."
1,Don't Buy,"Well after buying these O2 sensors I thought I got a great price compared to local stores! Well if they worked that would of saved me a lot. BUT, they are defective and of course its too late to return. Had to bring the car to a shop to figure it out. So I want to warn anyone who wants to use these Bosch Oxygen Sensors for their Chrysler Don't!! And according to a local Chrysler dealer Bosch O2s don't work in their cars. To late for me so heed my warning."
5,LIFE CHANGING!,"A MUST read for those who are desperate for more of God and unashamed to press on from religious tradition and knowing doctrines of the Lord to experiencing the manifest presence of the Lord! The principles in this book are so simple and when practiced will take you from glory to glory!! Next to the Bible, this book is a treasure from the Holy Spirit!"
3,great title,"Book has a few hymns in side, Authour minister knew to sing praises to God for a few hours, That brings the Glory of God, We enter Gods gates with Thanksgiving in our heartsWe enter Gods Courts with PRAISE,,not complaining,,,,Psalm 100More of a book about worship guidelines."
3,Good title,"Photography books are expensive enough as it is, and the hardback makes 'Signs & Relics' an over-priced waste of money. It is grossly misleading for amazon, as well as the official Wenders website, to advertise this book as a Plachy and Wenders production. Wenders' only contribution is the foreword which consists about 200 words, a foreword in which he even admits that he only bought the book because he liked the title."
3,Disappointing,"While I found this story intriguing and interesting, I cannot in all honesty recommend the book due to the poor editing. Very disappointing in view of the rather high cost. As I read the book, I concluded that the many errors contained in the novel were generated by editorial staff. Which leads me to believe that the publisher is lacking in that respect. I would advise Ms. Winters/Johnston to seek another publisher if she should continue to write."
2,Inexpensive but not an ice shaver,"I was looking for something that shaved ice for slushies. This chips ice into tiny crunchy pieces, not the fluffy slices that you want for a slushie."
1,Don't waste your money.,"My husband bought this for me, but we are very disappointed. The ice cubes just bounce off the blade as the machine turns. If the ice actually starts to grind, the machine jams and makes a terrible noise. After both my husband and I attempted to make it work for half an hour, we had a 1/2 cup of large grind snow cone ice which was melting quickly. You would be better off with a hammer and a freezer bag, and a lot less frustrated."
2,Not fine enough for my taste...,"I was hoping for an ice shaver that would produce very fine ice shavings, but this shaver won't do that. It leaves big crunchy chunks of ice. If you want something like a crunchy snowcone, then this shaver should be fine for you, but if you want fine shaved ice, this isn't even close. With the way it works, I've used it twice and now it sits on a shelf collecting dust. The plastic used for the shaver is fairly thin and gives an insubstantial feel. So far it's worked fine, but as noted above I haven't used it enough to cause any sort of wear. I suspect that it will break down over time due to the thin construction and the poor tolerances of the fit."
1,Works poorly!,"I had high hopes for this appliance. Unfortunately, it works extremely poorly. Placing a few pieces of ice (half moon shape) into the machine and turning it on, almost nothing happens. It literally will be on for 10 minutes to get a few tablespoons of shaved ice. To get enough shaved ice for a single snow cone, it often takes 20 minutes. Of course after that amount of time, the ice is already melting.For $30 I expected something much more useful."
1,it fell apart after two months use,the ice is not small enough to cource it worked fine a little noisy but it fell a part after two months use
5,Hamilton Beach ice shaver,I am very impressed with this ice shaver. It shave my ice perfect for Margaritas. It is easy to operate and cleaning take just a few seconds. I highly recommend.
2,Not worth it,"I purchased this for my son who had his tonsils removed. My ice maker produces curved cubes that didn't work well, or really, at all in this machine. I purchased a bag of ice to use and this worked better. On the slushie setting I was able to create some slushie ice although it took a long time. On the snow cone setting, the shaved ice produced would melt before enough was produced to make one snow cone."
2,Broke in 48 hours,We were looking for a snowcone machine that would fit my son's business starter budget. It was meant to be a snowcone stand versus a lemonade stand for the summer. The machine did not withstand multiple use times within in a 48 hour period. It broke. Sadly he was out the money and had to reinvest in another snowcone maker called the Back to Basics. It works much better and has been in daily use for over a month. With boys a month is a long time. Consequently I recommend not buying this one.
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this unit because of all the great reviews. However when I received mine the unit was very flimsy and shook when it tried to grind up the ice. I tried small and regular ice cubes and bagged ice to see if it made any difference. No difference. It took a long time for the ice to shave, was loud and did not make a difference in size when you changed the knob to the different setting. I returned it and will purchase something else."
1,don't waist your money,This is the worst ice shaver ever. It took me 20 minutes to get it to shave enough ice for a snow cone. Don't waist your money.
3,okay but not good,AFTER FREQUENT USE ABOUT TWO MONTHS THIS SHAVER BROKE. IT WAS DOING GREAT UNTIL THEN. I'M GOING TO INVEST IN ONE THAT HAS A LITTLE BETTER QUALITY SINCE I USE IT SO OFTEN.
4,Great for what is worth!,"This machine looks pretty sturdy and it has done its job very nice. You can make the ice as slush, or you can turn the knob and make it thinner for snow cones. In some instances, it might cut larger pieces, but come on, for the price I believe that I cannot argue much. It makes noise, but nothing as loud that we cannot handle. Try to be extra careful with it and do not drop it, as parts could be very sensitive (if you do, you can go to the Hamilton Beach website and find separate parts for it). If you decide to get this ice treat machine, you will enjoy many times of ice and drink pleasure, it is a great buy for what it is worth!"
5,Quality Suspect. I am on my 4th one in 2 years BUT I Love Still This Thing,"I HAD TO ADD TO MY REVIEW. I am on my 4th machine in 2 years. The latest one made it 3 weeks!! I still love the shaved ice that it makes but the QUALITY IS SUSPECT. The center shaft shears off. Hamiliton Beach will replace them but boy is it annoying.I couldn't be happier with this little machine. I haven't bought ice cream in months. Sweet and cold was all I needed. No more fat. I make my own flavored syrup so I know what is in it.The little machine has to be watched. It can jam but that is rare. It takes my ordinary ice cubes, no problem. I don't know what shaved ice is like but I LOVE what this machine makes. The two settings make a delicious textured treat. I wouldn't change a thing about the Icy Treats maker, it is fine just as it is.I can hardly wait to enjoy icy treats this summer."
2,Poor design -broke down after six months,"I ordered this machine based on it's reviews and it worked flawlessly for five months. It works well and efficiently if the ice cubes are placed consistently in the hopper. If the cubes are just dumped in randomly, they tend to melt around the center support and jam up, thus preventing the 'shaving' blades from engaging the ice. -This is a minor inconvenience only.The big problem was that after using it for five months, once every other day, the central post that locks down the blade bay in contact with the motor gears broke at the single screw in the locking ring. I am an engineer and IMO, if the locking ring post were made of a stronger material such as steel or delryn this would not have happened. The locking ring-post is made of injection molded plastic and is just not strong enough to last very long.I will not buy this design again -it only worked for about 100 uses."
4,What he experienced and what he thinks,"Dr. Bucke had a personal inner experience which was very powerful and illuminating to himself (what some call ""a private revelation""). In the edition I have it is described on pages 9 and 10...As the book develops he divides consciousness into simple consciousness (the animals), self awareness consciousness (human beings) and cosmic conciousness (very advanced human beings). He tells us that the founders of our well known religions, plus various well known writers possessed cosmic conciousness, and as the world advances, more and more persons will possess it...The book does not align itself to any particular religion. It is more a work of philosophy and imagination. The reduction of Christianity to just another religion is a disappointment to this reviewer. However, it is a book of powerful experience and powerful thought."
5,Strips and Curves,"An excellent book. The pictures and explanations of this quilting technique were very well written, and easily understandable. The end result was a quilt that looked very complicated but in reality was easy to make. I would highly recommend this book to any quilter."
4,Aziza is stunning!,"Obviously not the previous reviewer's cup of chai, and I will admit this is not my favourite album from this fabulous jazz-mugam composer/pianist/vocalist, but it is a superb album nonetheless."
1,Strawinsky butchered by two pianos and Brahms by a choir,"Strawinsky's beautiful and poignant ballet score has been altered here to be played by two pianists whose unremarkable countenances appear on screen between equally unremarkable computer graphics supposed to fit the music.None of this does justice to the composer.The Brahms Liebeslieder Waltzes are sung competently enough by a school choir, the static shots of the kids on two galleries, interspersed with very pretty nature images, but . . .The entire DVD is very disappointing. I would not have bought it if more information about the performance had been provided."
5,Favorite Heroine of All Time,Scarlett remains my favorite heroine of all the thousands of books I've ever read. I just reread the novel and still found it to be one of the best books ever. Timeless
1,Little extra value,"if you have already read ""How to teach your baby Math"" and ""How to teach your baby how to read"" you are wasting your money. The book ads very little to what the other two say.We only see a benefit in this book for those entering the Doman system, since they can get two books for the price of one."
3,Fire and Ice Roses,"The Roses were very Pretty, but when I got them, there were a lot of petals that kept falling off. The Stems were very thorny which made it hard to cut and arrange them in a vase.I am not sure that I would buy these again off line. I would rather go to a store and pay a little more for something that will last a little longer and not have to deal with a bunch of thorns or falling petals."
3,The Riccardo Finzi's second time,"Luciano Secchi (also known as Max Bunker) is one of greatest italian comics authors (Alan Ford, Kriminal, Satanik). This book is the second of the Riccardo Finzi Private Investigator series. In this episode the young investigator is engaged to discover the murder of a Milan jet set woman. As in the other books of the series, thrilling and humor (thanks to the Ciammarica's gags) are mixed in a funny cocktail."
4,Bones season 1,This is my favorite show! It arrived new in wrapping. I am having some trouble with some of the DVD freezing up. It arrived quickly. I've already ordered season 2!
3,"I love Bones, except the dvd discs.","I love Bones and own all of the seasons, except I was very disappointed to open up my dvd and notice that it has episodes on both sides of the disc. I could understand that maybe they wanted to save money but not putting 4 episodes on each disc, but I mean come on. Episodes on both sides of the dvd. It is stupid. It is really easy to get your fingerprints all over it. HOWEVER, I recommend buying this and all the others because bones is an amazing show and I am willing to overlook the double sided episodes because of this. Even though i really hate it!!"
5,Can't get enough :),"I love Bones! :) I watch it religiously. It is just the right amount of funny, romantic, and suspenseful. The writers, directors, and actors are brilliant. I like other TV shows, but this is the only one I own on DVD. I can watch it over and over; it never gets old."
4,Unexpected...,Well done!You'll se the girl you always wanted to meet...To bad it deals with lots of tiny bits of bones but...Entertaining to watch the girl you never met or never will.Like the Greek philopher Warren said: cool!Just get it.
5,Attention Buffy & Angel fans!,"Phenomenal.The only thing I can add to what other fans have already said is that if you're a Joss Whedon fan & you haven't seen these first episodes - you'll appreciate the cameo by Sunnydale's very own ""Mayor""!Well worth the investment."
1,How hard can it be...,"Although I do enjoy this show, and I would like to watch the DVDs, I just don't. Why not you may ask....Because there is no 'play all' feature, and this is very annoying to me. Is it that difficult to do? Or is it too expensive to add this when creating the DVDs? Sorry, but when I watch something I don't like rooting through the menu every 40-45 minutes. Had I known it didn't have this feature I never would have bought it, and I won't be buying any future sets.This also wouldn't play on my half of my DVD players. No idea why."
1,Extremely Poor Quality DVD's,"Title says it all. The TV series is outstanding, but these DVD are crap. Each and every DVD is defective. They will be sent back to Amazon."
4,Every character is Brilliant,There is nothing like listening to people converse that are both brilliant and love what they are doing. I wish I was there with them.
4,Bones season one,"Not bad, since I got interested in Bones Series in Season three. Haven't finished season 1 but have enjoyed first six episodes."
2,Wrong Color!!!,"I ordered these wheels in CLEAR, Package says CLEAR on it, but product is RED! The item is packaged in clear plastic, so it is obvious that these wheels are not CLEAR, but RED!"
4,good price,"Half the price as that listed on the Razor website, with free Amazon shipping...perfect. Easy to switch old wheels with new ones."
2,Avoid this import.,"Joe Cocker sings better today[2003], then he did back in the late seventies or early eighties when this album was recorded. This cd is no better than his other live retro release from the same period ""Standing Here"". The fact is that Joe was still on the mend from years of self abuse and it shows in the quality of his voice. He sounds terribly strained to say the least. If you buy this cd, you should compare it to his live cd ""Joe Cocker Live"" from 1990 on Capital records, and listen to the difference for yourself. I can see why this is only available as an import? This live document, should never have been released period. Although the band backing him is adequate, they do not come close to matching his Chris Stainton led band on the 1990 live cd. I consider any executive who okayed the release of this cd to have committed musical malpractice. Joe Cocker deserves better!"
3,I KNEW VOODOO,"I agree with the review given by ABC. The book was hard to put down, but I had to in order to make the corrections. I'm a single parent and full time college student and I know bad grammar when I read it. Ms. Caulton could definitely benefit from an editor or by simply using the spell check and grammar check on her computer. Her poor grammar in this best selling novel is a bad reflection on new african-american writers. Proofreading and editing classes are also available in college curriculums. With her earning from this best selling novel, I'm sure Ms. Caulton can afford to take the class."
5,Better than a soap opera.,"This book keep me going and going until it was all gone. I could only hope for the author to come out with the follow up to this saga of drama that put a lot of thought to mind if this could be true of this ""voodoo thing"", and if so give me the number to the nearest shop so I can get me a man."
2,ABC's,"I feel really bad writing this review because, as a struggling writer myself, I know how important it is to receive positive feedback, and at the very least, constructive criticism. I will start by saying that the plot was wickedly amusing, with outlandish, over the top characters that you pray you'd never meet in real life. The premise was intriguing. Having said that, I must go on to say that, grammatically speaking, Voodoo Love was the most poorly-written book I have ever read. Misplaced commas had me pausing where I should have plowed through, misspelled words had me reaching for my dictionary every 45 seconds, because , maybe, just maybe, ""caint"" is a word? She needs to get an editor - it is worth the money, and her audience will increase 100-fold. The author knows how to tell a good story - she just needs to learn how to write one."
4,Crazy plot,"Voodoo love was an interesting book. I was very dissapointed with the grammatical errors that were in the book however, the book kept my interest. There were a lot of characters to keep straight. I think the reason why I liked the book was because the plot was unpredictable and somewhat crazy. It made me think of the saying ""what goes around comes back around."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,This book was so bad I can't believe it's in bookstores. The editor must have been asleep. The grammar mistakes are numerous and distracting. The plot is clever but the writing is breathtakingly awful.
4,Good Book for a Christian,"Me.. being a Christian teen, I really enjoyed this book. It was a good read, but kind of short. The one part though that made me not give this book a five is that it was published before his career was over. He said he could now walk away from the game knowing his career was over. (1994). But Hawk actually did come back with the Marlins the next year. It was a good book, and an easy read."
5,Dreamweaver,Chris' book whets the appetite and the line for some amazing destinations around the world. It gives enough information to garner interest but leaves enough scope to plan your own trip or just dream of being able to fish these areas. As you would expect it is centred on America but it does have enough worldly destinations to have a wider appeal. Top read and lots of fun
4,a love story undiminished by time,"An immortal wartime romance with Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotten, I'LL BE SEEING YOU remains one of the most beloved films of the era. Rogers plays Mary Marshall, a female ex-con on parole, who meets by chance the handsome yet severely shell-shocked soldier Zachary Morgan (Cotten). Their romance plays out against the odds; two damaged people who find comfort and understanding in each other.Based on the radio play ""Double Furlough"" by Charles Martin, the screenplay by Marion Parsonnet amiably showcases Rogers and Cotten in some of their most vivid and unguarded work. With Shirley Temple, Spring Byington (who had previously co-starred in 1940's ""The Blue Bird""), Chill Wills and Tom Tully."
2,Good until the end when one line ruined the whole thing,"Before getting to 3 pages from the end of the book, I would have rated this book much higher. I seem to be the only reviewer that is appalled by one line spoken by the ""hero"" of the story. The book focuses on the struggles of a single mom, fleeing a mob-connected father-in-law. The author made the mental, physical and sexual abuse of the ""heroine"" a key point in the book. Good story until the end when she and the hero were reunited and he states how often he's thought of seeing her again and ""raping her sweet a@@."" WHAT????!@!!@@?? Are you kidding me? There is NEVER an occasion when this comment should be used as a joke or an endearment. It will be a long time, if ever, before I buy another Catherine Anderson book."
4,Great for home haircuts,"I have had this Hair trimmer for about two months now. The three males in the family use it to touch up their hair every two weeks or so. Built like a rock, but will eat up the batteries, so be prepared with rechargables. I have purchased another for a Christmas gift."
3,Run of the mill,"I love Jimmy Stewart but these just seemed to be ""ok"" westerns. Not the usual really good ones by the master of the slow and syrupy manner."
4,"Good stuff, goes down easy","My baby loved it from day one, but its MUCH cheaper and just as good to mix it from powder. Takes up less room too, and doesnt need refrigeration."
3,"Good weight, poor body fat measurement","This scale is fantastic for weight. As the previous users said before, the scale closely matches ones in gyms/doctor offices.However, I highly question the body fat percentage. I am 5'10"" 145 # and I work out a decent amount- 5 hours of fairly intense cardio/week. Yet somehow, I was 30% body fat. That's seems really high. When I do body measurements- arms, waist, neck, hips, I get 22.8%. I think that I am more in the middle of the two. However, I am training to climb Mt. Kilmanjaro (the reason why I bought the scale), so I am sure that it will be great for seeing trends, but I wouldn't rely on it for one-time measurements."
3,Hurts my face,All Uvex googles are great but this one hurts my face. The Uvex S3970DF fits great and I will order more of those.
3,"I did get some growth, but .....","This could dry the scalp at first. If you scratch your scalp after you put this liquid on, you will get a purple residue under your nails."
4,agree with Patrick,"I have been looking for this on CD for YEARS! I would do almost anything to get it, and now I havae found it! The song ballad has stuck with me for years!"
5,What a great find!!,"I've been searching for this for a long time and was so glad I found it!! I've checked other internet sites for this in the past, without any luck. Normally I don't buy a CD for one song, but the song ""What About Me"" was well worth the cost. Just as another reviewer commented, I play this song when I feel down about my life not being where I want it to be. I kind of felt like the song was about me. I will sugget this CD to a friend of mine who also likes this song."
3,One song is worth the purchase price alone,"In the U.S., they were one-hit-wonders from down under. Most of the CD can be listened to once a year and that is more than enough. But the song ""What About Me"" is a very powerful, solid rock ballad that makes this CD worth the purchase price alone. If you are 30-something, this tune will bring back fond memories or your high school years."
2,This book is insightful and ruthless.,"This is a very cruel book. It turns Machiavelli's words into childrens' words, and what he said is insightful and ruthless. As you might know, Niccolo Machiavelli, known as the father of political science, lived in Florence, Italy between 1469 and 1527. This book was based on another book by him, The Prince, which was in adult language and converted to little people talk in this book. This book was full of cruel proverbs such as, ""If you just took over someplace, have a bunch of friends from your old neighborhood go live there too. People won't even notice that these old friends of yours are actually your spies."" Even though it was cruel, this book was extremely funny in the sense that this is in child's language (such as ""'cos or 'specially"") and it is so wrong. It really made me laugh, and it would probably do the same thing to you. I especially liked where it said something about people being scared of you but not hating you. Nathaniel Hillard, age 11"
3,Not exactly purple,"These are really blue cathodes with purplish stripes painted on the glass. It isn't terrible, but it isn't really what it looks like in the photograph."
5,What Fun!!,"My 4-year-old just LOVES these! He's a picky kid when it comes to toys. He hates toys that do things on their own. He'd rather be the one making the toy into something that he wants to make it into.I was surprised at the material that the Wedgits are made of. I thought they were going to be soft and pliable. I was actually happy to find how sturdy these hard plastic pieces are. No breaking, tearing, or biting parts off. They'll never break or chip, so they'll last for years and years.These make a great addition to any creative kids library of toys. They'll spend hours and hours building and creating. Perfect!"
1,Don't waste your money !!!,Just some audio. Boring discussion between some people while boring images are shown.This is not worth the money they are asking !!!
4,The intro is the best part,"I enjoyed this book and the photography in it. But honestly, some of the poetry just seemed a wee bit contrived to me... as if Norris HAD to find something holy in the act of locking a door or shoveling.There are parts of it that are very well written, I love reading her prefaces and such in all her books. And parts of the actual prose was meaningful for me. But I'm glad it was just a library book.A note: I got this book thinking it spoke to a strictly Catholic spirituality... it does not. Elements of her writing lead me to believe there was a Catholic influence but she speaks in much more universal tones... even new-agey at times.Still there is nothing TOTALLY objectionable to most faiths unless one is offended by her referring to her ""single-celled ancestors.""I was still able to glean some nice meditation points from this book."
2,Disappointed,"The shuffler we ordered does not feed properly. At first we thought it might be something we were doing wrong, but since there were no instructions included, we kept experimenting, reducing from two decks of cards to just one to shuffle. Sometimes that seemed to help, but sometimes not. We finally figured it is not working right. But we missed the cut-off date to return it by a couple of weeks. We would not think of selling a defective product. My uncle uses this kind of shuffler with good results. We are very disappointed and it looks like our only recourse is to return it for a part of the cost."
5,Works real well,"This scale is good. Weight is accurate, Body fat % is accurate, easy to use. You can store two peoples profiles and it has a guest option if other want to use it.The only downside is that it does not start up automatically when you step on it. But it is fast, easy and accurate to use. The packaging and product quality are far superior to similar priced models from Taylor."
4,"Really Fast Shipping,Rather Expensive Shipping",Really fast Shipping but rather expensive shipping. The book was in decent condition for being used.
1,-- Pre-Cyberpunk Novel by William Gibson?,"I found this novel to differ wildly from william gibson's excellent ""cyberpunk"" novels...Neuromancer, Burning Chrome, Count Zero, etc. It's really hard to believe the work is written by the man who gave us the gritty prose of ""Idoru"" and the amazing Artificial Intelligence characters of ""Neuromancer"". The book is historical in nature, but unlike ""The Difference Engine"" (in which John Keats falls in with Charles Babbage and devises a mechanical computer) _the events happen exactly as they might have in the real world!_ There is no alternate history, no fanciful imaginings, nothing!"
1,Worst Book I have ever seen,"This book is the worst! First the are very few example problems, in fact I found myself in the library checking out other circuits book, because this one had no expiations or examples for a problem included in its text. Once I did learn how to solve the circuit; I had no way to check my answers, because there isn't any student's solution manual available. Lastly and most aggravating, and the reason I urge you not to buy this book... The answers in the back are wrong! To my estimates (and I am not exaggerating,) about 1:3 or wrong, or have errors in one form or another. How is a student supposed to learn if his/her answers are correct? but the book tells you otherwise. Please do not use this book; it is useless!"
2,Not an introductory book,"I used this book during my freshman year as an ECE student. The book is too complicated for the novice engineer. At the end of each section is 1 or 2 examples that have complete instruction and pretty much hold your hand. The end of the chapter problems are too complicated, and in the back of the book, only a third of the answers are given so you don't know if your answers to most odd and even numbered problems are correct...what on earth? The author is probably counting on individuals contacting their instructors, which is a bad idea given that my instructor was anything but instructional. And he refused to give answers or even look at my even numbered problems. NOTE TO AUTHOR: Have appropriate level of reader proof read your book."
1,This is the worst book I have ever used,"This book is terrible. There are far to few answers to the problems in the back of the book. The answers that are there are also frequently wrong. It is very confusing, and close to impossible to teach yourself the material by reading the book alone. My teacher says he will never use this book again. AVOID IT."
1,worst ever,This is the worst text book I have ever had throughout any educational program. I strongly suggest requesting your school to use another book for circuit theory. There are error after error in this book and the publisher even forgot to attach appendix G. The example problems have incomplete solutions and are elementary compared to the difficult homework problems. The writers of this book must have expected you to only use this book as a work book because the methods discussed dont prepare you for the homework. Stay away from this book. Also the binding is week as mine has come apart after 1 semester (and i bought it new)
1,A bad text book.,"Pros: This text book is clean. The authors cut all the junks and go straight to the points. This makes the reading pleasant.Cons: Since the authors decided to make the text short, they cut steps on how to solve the problem on the examples. So if you need to look for help by reading the examples, you are screwed! In addition to it, I feel like that just throw the concepts to you, without explanations and expect you to figure them out.The most frustrating thing to me is: In some problems, in order to solve them, I have to guess what the authors were saying because the language is so confused.If I have a choice, I will not use this text book. Too bad, I don't have a choice."
1,AWFUL!!! AVOID THIS BOOK!!!,"I am currently taking a circuit course & this book makes it a pain! Everything is harder than it should be. It's a major frustration having to study with this book in my CIS class. I hate the author! Examples have skipped steps & sometimes I can't tell how the author came up with certain numbers in his examples. Honestly, I have read better circuit material in my experience.To all those who have to deal with this book, I say ""good luck!"" Your gonna need it.I mostly don't burn my textbooks after I'm done with them, but in this case, I'll make an exception. This book is just that bad."
4,Good transaction,"The book was in the condition described. The item arrived within the estimated time. Over all, a good transaction."
1,Almost Waste of money,"Too bad that there is books which are expensive, but quite not good in terms of quality. Nilsson's book is an very old one, and it used to be very standard long time ago. But Nilsson is no longer writing it now. And the other authors didn't do any good job keeping the book updated."
1,This is possibly one of the worst engineering textbooks ever published.,"This is a really bad textbook! It's easily the worst one I have come across. It's in its 8th edition, yet it still has a great number of typos. The assessment problems are very useless too. They give you a problem statement followed by the answer with no detailed solution as to how they got the answer. The chapters themselves also do not explain enough or give enough information to do most of the end-of-chapter problems. They show you how to derive equations then give you a bunch of problems that leave you scratching your head. The problems at the end of the chapters really go beyond what is discussed in the textbook chapters and prior knowledge in electrical circuits is required to get through most of the problems. I think the lessons are way too abstract and more information needs to be given. The book is overpriced too and really isn't worth the investment."
3,OK text,"This text is alright, but it does assume prior knowledge of circuits. The exercise problems are way more difficult than any of the examples in the text and not all of the answers are provided in the back of the book. Also, (VERY IMPORTANT) this ISBN does NOT include the PSpice manual that is usually required for a basic circuits course."
3,Play Misty for me,"When Jerry finds an old piano in the attic of the new house, they have the instrument taken downstairs. At night he hears the piano play a sad tune, but no one is there.He starts taking piano lessons. At first he likes it. The teacher seems okay and the technical genius of a caretaker has an array of self-made maintenance robots.But Jerry keeps hearing someone playing his piano.This one was too weird for my taste. It didn't even make sense. What would the hands be needed for? It's not like they can play on their own accord. I have no problems with fantastic ideas, but this plot didn't make any sense at all.The story is okay, but the conclusion is too off."
1,Kurt Angle in a home movie,"I was a fan of Kurt Angle in the Olympics and hoped he would become and actor. He had the look and personality. Instead he went into WWE which was very disappointing.Kurt finally gets to act in End Game. Unfortunately it is just a low-quality home movie. The story could have been interesting and it could have been interesting to see Kurt play this kind of character, however, it is very amateurish and the production values are worse than porn.I was wondering how they got a name guy like Kurt Angle in this no budget movie so I did some research and apparently he made this with some friends from college.End Game is a very disappointing starring debut for Kurt Angle.By the way, they never even explained why he goes around killing women."
1,Plan 9 From Outer Space Has Been Dethroned,"Plan 9 From Outer Space had been crowned the worst movie ever made. END GAME, incredulsy, has dethroned and detrashed Plan 9. Wooden hesitant acting, plodding pace and an inane story caused me to END GAME early."
4,Value of SystemWorks,I received the item on time and installation went with no problems. Configuration of modules was mostly accepting the defaults. Easy! Has been running with no problems. Excellent product. A good purchase choice on my part.
1,Capacity?,"I don't believe that I ever saw exactly how big this ""trash can""is! Would be helpful when ordering ... would you not think.Most generally there is a general overview, dimensions etc.. ofan item. Unless I've just missed it entirely, it ain't there.Would probably have ordered this item if I'd have had more infoabout it.Thank-you and Regards,E. L. Jones"
5,By My Brother's Side,By My Brother's Side is about two boys that love sports but their favorite is football. Their names are Ronde and Tiki Barber. WHen Tiki was little he fell down a dirt hill on his bike and cut his knee open and the doctor said he may never be able to play sports again. Now Tiki Barber is on the New York Giants (number 21) and his brother Ronde Barber is on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (number 20). They now are professional football players.
4,WindMan.EXE,"For an "".EXE"" remake of WindMan, I have to say that this is a pretty good figure. As expected, the fists can come off. The only problem with it is the paint job is lacking in some figures."
4,i love it! yup yup!,"I've been known not to represent ""well known"" brands (ipods, converse, jordans, supras, etc.)With my beautiful pink zune.. no words can really explain how I feel.It's great that it has a radio built in when you wanna listen to fresh new musiq instead of the musiq you loaded up on your zune.It's great!"
3,Zune,"I like my Zune for listening to music. It's a bit difficult to put my movies in, which I still have not been able to do. It's not picking up my wireless Internet either. I'm just starting to have problems with power flickering off while playing and on while not. We'll see. Only had it less than 2 months."
5,Surprisingly Hilarious,"My goodness, this was a pleasant surprise! I'll definitely be getting more seasons. This show is a constant source of belly laughs. It lures you in with standard yet engaging plot lines and then blind sides you with crazy funny jokes out of no where! Neil Patrick Harris is in his prime and steals the show entirely. By the second episode I didn't even mind the laugh track. I suggest if you enjoy silly and sometimes heartfelt entertainment, give How I Met Your Mother a shot."
3,Broken Case,"The season is a great season. I gave this as a gift, but when it arrived the case inside was broken...If the case was not broken I would have given it more stars."
2,Why No Widescreen Version?,Pretty disappointed when I popped the first DVD in and saw the black bars on the screen. Got Season 2 at the same time and it's Widescreen.
3,My other review was harsh so i am starting a new one,"Even though i never received the item, this person was very helpful to me and kept me up to date when it would arrive. But is now cooperative with me now that i am asking for a refund. :)"
2,Presented in Squishvision for your viewing displeasure,"The series is awesome.On the other hand, the presentation is not only in the aforementioned fullscreen mode, but it's also distorted - everyone's heads are slightly wider than they should be. I find it nearly unwatchable. Why are proper proportions so difficult for Fox?"
4,some real fun here,This series is really a nice one except with the fact that Barney character reminds me of Jeff from Coupling.
2,"Great idea, but...","I bought this set for my shop sink. I'm there 3 or 4 times a week so the idea that it shuts off the water with excessive flow caught my attention. When installing, the nut connecting the new line to the water valve leaked, as I tightened it up the nut separated from the rest of the new line and water sprayed until I shut off the valve. I hope this was a manufacturing defect and not a normal occurrence. I hesitate to use this product again."
4,ABRIDGED (abridged),"K./Eremita/... is certainly an amazing and entertaining philosopher, and one should either read everything of his or nothing, I was surprised that the book is not listed as ABRIDGED. The first (and most popular) book is less badly cut, and I'm sure all of the excisions improve the book, if you're serious about K., you might find this a problem. E/O is a two volume work-- good luck finding them, though."
5,5 years and its still running,Working perfectly since the day i got it - that was maybe 5 years ago.It still scans weight and body fat accurately. Battery life lasts anywhere from 6 months to a year.
3,Very good for weight but so-so for body-fat measurements,The scale gives consistent readings...but there is no correlation between it's ability to weigh accurately and it's ability to measure body fat accurately. The body-fat measurement is useful as a reference point but is not as accurate as the weight.
2,I thought Aerosoles were supposed to be comfortable...,"I bought these boots after reading countless reviews of how comfortable they were. I was looking for a pair of cute, black suede wedges that I could wear during my commute and at work. These are not the right boots for that. First of all, your balance gets all thrown off in these boots - you feel like you're teetering around on the balls of your feet. I've seen other girls in the same boots and they all walk the same way, like they're going to fall on their face any second. I added an inner sole to try and soften the pressure on the balls of my feet, but it didn't help much. Also, when I tried to waterproof them, one turned a funny, faded shade of black while the other one stayed normal, so that didn't help the situation. Cute boots, just totally uncomfortable and hard to walk in, and obviously not meant to be waterproofed."
2,Only 1 pair,"They are a very nice pair of socks, but I can't see paying $10 for one pair of socks!! I never would buy them again!!"
1,Terrible!,Purchased this after I had a baby and I may as well have been sitting on a board. It went right in the trash!
2,Happy Not-So Birthday to Me,"I honestly didn't like this film very much. At all, to be honest. I respect that it was made in the 80's and it's going to be cheesy, yes, but it was just all over the place to me. Didn't enjoy it and gave it away right after I got it in the mail."
2,Guts and gore but nothing more...,"This movie was as corny as they come. Though I do sometimes like a staleness to a movie for a good laugh. I felt the story was lame and the ending is odd. I would have the killer pegged as someone else...anyone else! However, I do like the amount of gore in this flick. It's really the only thing that kept me interested."
3,Happy Birthday To Me delivers...sort of,"Virginia Wainwright (Melissa Sue Anderson) has returned to school after a car accident a year before that had claimed her mother's life. Virginia's injuries had required experimental brain surgery, and she's under the care of a doctor (Glenn Ford). Trouble is, her friends start to turn up missing at the same time she starts to experience memory lapses. Film uses pre ""Scream"" formula of making everyone a suspect, but characters often behave oddly, and even after repeated viewings the film is confusing. Veteran director J. Lee Thompson has a great formula, but too many undeveloped red herrings spoil it. The ads boast ""Six of the most bizarre murders you will ever see"", and that's pretty accurate. A very interesting misfire, but a must see for horror fans. Too bad, because there is some real talent behind and in front of the camera."
1,"Not the least bit scary, just laughable","There are bad horror movies that are fun BECAUSE they're bad, but this isn't even one of those. Sorry, Melissa Sue Anderson still looks too clean and pretty to make a good scream queen, and this film appears to attempt several different plot devices in an attempt to make itself work - revenge against the snobs, innocent girl framed for murder, a friend as the real killer as a plot twist (that fails to shock) and a lackluster ending. All of them fail and this one is simply a waste of good popcorn. If you want a real scare, re-view ""Halloween"" or ""When a Stranger Calls Back."" If you want to watch a bad horror movie, pick the ""Friday the 13th"" of your choice"
3,SLICK SLASHER,"25 years ago, this movie was heralded for its unique methods of killing off its teenage victims. Looking back, one can see why, but since then we've certainly found even crueler ways to dispense of nubile young actors and actresses.This post-HALLOWEEN entry benefits from a twisty script, some innovative photography and a cast that's above average. Goody two shoes LITTLE HOUSE star Melissa Sue Anderson had her first ""adult"" role as the troubled teen whose mother died while taking her to a snooty party four years prior to the time of the film. Now, members of Anderson's elite group of ten are being murdered, their bodies vanishing. The script gives you lots of potential suspects and by the ending, it pulls a major twist. Tracy Bregman, Glenn Ford and Sharon Acker are sharp in their supporting roles, and as far as this type of film goes, this is one of the better ones."
5,Overlooked Masterpiece,"I am so happy that this movie is finally coming out on DVD. I have looked everywhere for it, and I could never find a worthy copy. Thank goodness someone finally found this movie and decided to put it to DVD. I have heard that there is a sequel in the works????"
2,Slasher.,"Although I adore slasher films... this is not one of y favorites. It's a hard watch. Not because of the blood and gore, but because it's slow. It kind of dragged on. But as a horror fan, it fits in well with the rest of my collection."
1,Sheena Easton - Greatest Hits Remastered,"I had at one time, the original album and this remastering has ruined her voice quality and songs. The background music completely drowns out Sheena's voice. I thought that I was buying some good memories and instead I was so disappointed. I would not recommend."
2,Not for me,"I expected to like this tea because I love the flavors of hazelnut and vanilla, but I am disappointed with the flavor of this tea and even ""doctoring it up"" with sugar and milk doesn't make it appealing to me."
3,Beware of Edited Tracks,"I'll reiterate the other reviewer who warned of edited tracks. I purchased a combined May Blitz and Second of May CD some time ago and found severe edits that made me return it. It might or might not be the same one that is offered here, but I don't see individual track times listed. The worst edit was a big chunk (half a minute) chopped out of the guitar-frenzy middle of Fire Queen, which for me was a loss of the best part of the best song on the better of the two albums. I had purchased both the albums on vinyl when they were first released, and the Fire Queen track is 4:12 long. Just be careful if you're a fan. You can guess what albums I play on the first and second of May each year."
4,A Blast from the past,"Smoking the Day Away - I became hooked on this song after buying May Blitz's first album based on a Rolling Stone article a LONG time ago. I've been missing that great jam in the middle of the song ever since retiring my turntable so was delighted to see this available digitally at last. That song is a truly HEAVY progressive blues/rock/psychedelic classic (great sound too for 1970) with amazing base riffs, and the rest of the first album is also very good - an underappriciated gem in my book. I'd not heard the second album before so have no emotional attachement to that music. For this reason I'm not sure if it's just me or if something else happened to the chemistry but I'm not as hot on the second album on this CD. Just the first song makes it worth the investment though, especially if you want to hear some amazing early 70 sounds that for whatever reason never made the big time."
2,These hymns lack something...,"Maybe this should have been called, ""Medley of 31 Classic Hymns.""This CD features the first chorus of 31 classic hymns, but don't expect the full length hymns. Each track consists of one (possibly two in some cases) chrous of each hymn, beautifully sung with an orchestra, and each track leads into the next, seamlessly.Just wanted to warn anyone who might think they'll be getting 31 complete hymns."
2,"Trendy Can, but didn't last long",I bought this can a year ago and had the same problem described by everyone else. The plastic clip on the bottom cracked and it can't be used anymore. I tried to email the company 2x's and have heard nothing. I went back to where I bought it and they no longer sell the brand....wonder why!!!! Too expensive for 1 year.
1,ZERO Stars - DO NOT BUY this piece of junk!!,"Oh boy. still images of Christmas cards, mall santas, Christmas trees, toys, and decorations with musical background. The people who gave this DVD a good review either live in a cardboard world, or they work for the company who produced this hunk-o-junk!"
2,great artist poor sound,"to begin, the audio was bad there was a lack of bass and it didn't have that live feel to it. It should have been remastered, with the technology available today, it would have been a five star recording."
4,Don't listen to these people talking about sublime,"I hear so many unfair reviews towards pepper because basically they dont sound like sublime or that they are slipping away from sublime, THEY ARE THEIR OWN BAND! THEREFORE THEIR OWN SOUND! DEAL WITH IT.But this record is a great one just put it in and you dont have to touch the dial , everysong on here has something different to offer."
4,A decent cd.,I like this cd. it is well put together and the songs have a great feel to them. No control and green hell are my favorites.
4,Plastic Bowling Pins,This product was great. I was very happy with the quality and weight of the pins .
1,too tight and over priced,"I wear a 6 1/2 in women shoes, with this shoe a 7 waas tight and the 7 1/2 was to big. Also I happen to be in a store in NYC and seen the same shoe for $19.00 what's that about?"
2,its a cute idea but not for toddlers,it worked for my 2 year old for a few days till she figured out how to open the lid and that was the end of this item...... useless
4,Interesting,"A bit confusing the first time around, but once you get the rules down it can be great fun. Not an every weekend kind of game, but fun once a month or so."
4,For Adults Only Game,The game pieces were all there and good quality material. Me and my friends play it often and it's a blast.
3,Great for generic questions.,"It was good for one time use, but the questions are generic like ""I've never mooned someone"" or ""I've never cheated on an exam"". They get as dirty as ""I've never bought a sexual toy"". I guess maybe I'm used to dirtier questions, because these certainly weren't shocking in any way. They were also questions I think we all could've thought of on our own. I wanted really witty, new questions and I was disappointed.Can't REALLY complain, just not as impressed as I could've been."
5,Excellent -- one episode description is off...,"Love this hard-to-find product. However, I noticed on volume 2 of the 3 disc set, the description for one of the episodes was way off. The name of the episode is, ""Pearls of Peace"". The back of my case sums it up as, ""Germs before wisdom finds Simon dabbling in biotechnology"". Huh?! The plot had nothing to do with that, and I have found it more accurately described elsewhere as, ""Simon financially invests in a friend's pearl diving scheme in Mexico, but the venture goes horribly wrong."" It is, even more accurately, a love story. Enjoy!"
5,Fine,I love the way Roger Moore starts outthe show by talking directly to theviewers. The plot and action of eachshow is interesting. Of course thereis all That Roger Moore adtion that makesthe show so enjoyable. He is alway one step aheadof the bad guys.
3,WHAT'S TO SAY,"THEY ARE A SKEWER THAT DO WHAT SKEWERS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO.. THEY WORK FINE WITH CHEESES, SALAMI, MARTINI OLIVES ETC ETC."
5,Kids life jacket,Bought this life jacket for my grandson who is very small for his age. The small adult size was way too big on him. We used this last week & it works very well. He had no problem getting it on. Made very well. Very pleased with my purchase.
1,JUNK! Did not work.,"I cant say these are all junk, just mine. It looks very cheap. I put new batteries in it, hooked it up- nothing. changed it with a different brand of new batteries, still nothing. it just sat there."
4,It's a gift,"I did give this mag as a gift so I don't know if I liked it. It is fair to say however, that she (gift receiver) did and does enjoy this mag, because she requested it again, after receiving it all last year."
3,"Well, my daughter likes it","My daughter seems to like it, but it's a pretty thin magazine. Not a whole lot of pages to it. I guess the idea is quantity over quality. That's pretty much the theme of our society now days tho..... :("
3,5400-90 Swingline Ironing Board,"bought one of these boards, great sturdy board, extends really high up, bonus for me being over 6ft. only downside is I am having great difficulty getting a replacement cover, however this does not take away from the board itself. Jeans can be ironed without shuffling them on and off the board, its a big big ironing board, well worth the extra cost"
1,Inferior Work,This is far from Sarah's good work. One would best be served to check out her Mercury/Roulette years.Her prime years
4,"Great from beginning, to end!","Hudson, who is already well-known for her passionate and emotional love stories, has truly out-done herself in ""Warrior's Song."" All of the charecters will forever stick out in your memory as being heroic and enchanting, but are also down-to-earth enough for us all to believe in their realism. Hudson lets the readers know just enough to keep you wanting, not to mention theorizing, 'till the very end, you can bet I was! Just plain great reading!"
1,I saw this movie on a Dare... It was the only way!!!!,"I don't mean to be a kill joy but I just don't have very much good to say about this film. Everything was just too predictable. I don't have anything against being silly but be an artist about it. Don't just be silly for the sake of being silly. It took me two days to get through the film. In my opinion a movie with a lot of the same gags and, to myself , was funny was ""Harold and Kumar go to white Castle""."
1,Atrociously Horrible,"This movie was so absolutely unfunny. I thought it might be very amusing, the premise was entertaining, and the actors have been funny at times, but no. I was wrong.I watched this movie the other day and I was just appalled at how stupidly absurd everything was, and I love stupid absurdity! Most of the time it's funny. This movie was not funny. The younger Wayans brothers need to seriously find something that they are good at because this whole comedy thing isn't it."
5,White Chicks,"Despite their best efforts, agents Marcus and Kevin Copeland have worked their way down to the bottom of the FBI food chain. Their most recent bust was a failure and they are hanging onto their jobs by a thread. When a plot to kidnap spoiled socialite sisters Brittany and Tiffany Wilson is uncovered, the big case is given to Marcus and Kevin's rivals Vincent Gomez and Jake Harper. This is a great movie. It was well-written, wonderfully directed and clean. Great movie for teens and adults alike."
1,Racist Movie,"This movie is so racist and ignorant it makes me sick. Its basically black men putting on ""white face"" and making fun of white girls. How would our society react about a movie called ""Black Chicks"" with two white guys using ebonics and dressed up like black girls? All Hell would break loose but I guess its okay to make fun of white people. This movie sucks."
2,"Laugh-out-loud funny, at times","I think that there was some very good physical comedy and some extremely funny scenes. The story is ok, the actors are attractive, the comic dialogue is very entertaining, and the leading ladies (and men dressed as ladies) have excellent chemistry. It's no profound film, it's just a simple comedy. It's not the best film of the year, but it really has some of the funniest scenes of any film this year. I honestly laughed out loud during the film numerous times. Although everyone else laughed too, I worried someone was going to tell me to quiet down a little (I tend to be louder than most people). The point is: I actually noticed that I was laughing a whole lot more than I do at any other comedies. It really had some great moments! Even so, I'll give it overall two to three stars, after all it's no Oscars contender."
1,What's The World Coming To?,"I'll have to agree with the reviewers who claim that this movie shows clear and obvious racial bias towards white people. And yes if this movie had the title BLACK CHICKS or LATINO CHICKS or ASIAN CHICKS etc. there would've been a serious backlash from those respective communities and rightly so. There is a double standard at work here never mind that so called ""white, western culture"" is dominant and there is an attempt in this movie to criticize this culture and it's motifs, the Wayans brothers could've done that a little better than this poor and somewhat racist attempt. But like SOUL PLANE, if you don't like it's premise and title don't pay money to see it. It's as simple as that. I expect a little more from the Wayans brothers instead of this film that attempts to cash in on racial stereotyping."
4,pretty good,"I ordered this item as a gift. I had no idea that it was edited, however the recipient was pleased with it."
5,This movie is so AWESOME,THE MOVIE WHITE CHICKS WAS THE MOST AWESOME MOVIE I'D EVER SEEN EXCEPT FOR THE MOVIE SHREK 2; THAT WAS ALSO AN AWESOME MOVIE TOO. I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT THAT MOVIE WHITE CHICKS WAS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIE SO FAR.
1,IDK,I purchased this movie as a gift for christmas and she opened the case on Christmas morning there was no disc!!
5,Fine acting.. REMARABLE in fact.,"All in all a fine movie. Here's what amazed me though. Two black men managed to act like believable white women. Oh, a few slip-ups for comedy affect but they actually passed as women in this movie. Ugly women (whereas the two they were impersonating were HOT!) but still believable women.Wayans, why are you not trying serious roles? You could do it, guys!------Off topic note: If you want to see this type of thing in a different way watch ""Priscilla Queen Of The Desert"". Three straight actors play flaming homosexual transvestites."
1,Cloaked Creationism.,"I downloaded this book for my children to read, expecting it to be an informative read. I, as I tend to do, began to read the book to establish suitability. I didn't get beyond the beginning of the second chapter before I realised this book is a propaganda book for creationism. This book has less to do with stars and more to do with crediting ""creation"" to an imaginary friend of the author. For those who wish to encourage their children to read factual books that are untainted by superstition, look elsewhere as this book is not for you."
3,Keep a dictionary handy,"Wallace has always written with the intention of trying to impress. His stories here are good, not great. Everytime I have to keep a dictionary handy when reading fiction - for entertainment - I know I am reading a pretentious snob. Long paragraphs of exposition for the purpose of imparting a small detail is overwriting. Keep it simple, like Hemingway, not going for the unattainable, grandiose ten pound volumes like Pynchon. Wallace should find his own voice and stop pretending to be someone else.Read these stories for the occasional approach to brilliance, but don't be too disappointed when they don't quite make it. Being previously published in the New Yorker is a sure sign of literary snobbery.Wallace has, in the past proven to have more talent, and if he stops being pseudo-intellectual he can return to his roots and be much more successful."
5,Black Onyx Celtic ring,"I bought this ring as gift and the person I bought it for loved the ring. The delivery was quick and all other aspects of the order went great.Black Onyx Celtic Claddagh Sterling Silver Ring (Size 6,7,8,9)"
4,Inside History of NPR,"No scholar or writer knows more about the history of National Public Radio than Michael McCauley, and his book is packed with fascinating tidbits and shrewd insights about an institution many of us are addicted to. Very little of substance has been written about NPR, and this book, which contains fragments from scores of interviews the author conducted with NPR insiders, is the place to begin. The footnotes also make good reading. --Scott Sherman"
3,When Will the Rest Be Available?,"Just wondering if anyone knows when the remaining ""Early Episodes"" will be available, if at all?"
5,Very good read,"I purchased the Foxfire volumes 1-12 in a single purchase. Highly recommend them if one is looking to learn skills from the ""old school."" Directions and pictures are very good. Our family is one interested in learning skills from past, such as soap making, cabin building, etc. and we found that these books are a very valuable source of information. There are areas of these books that are simply documentations of folklore and such, especially in the areas of herbal/natural medicine, that one will immediately recognize as ineffective, but it is still interesting to read this folklore anyway. Most of the Foxfire books have incredible, ""lost"" skills that we find very interesting. The books are good. Your money will be well spent."
3,DVDs,I didnot understand the notice that went with this DVD movie classic. It does not work on by player and it is no ones fault but my own. I had thought all DVDs were the same but evidently I was wrong. I opened it up to try so it can not be returned.
1,What Happened?,"I loved Lonelyland & I'm Good Now, so I just scooped up this album without previewing it. It was a MISTAKE. (And not only mine - oh, BOB, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?) It doesn't have any of the heart or attitude of the others, it's silly dance-club idiocy! Spare yourself the pain!"
4,very good learning tool,"I brought this computer for my God daughter in 2003 when she was six. She loves it. Some of the activities were too advance for her then, but now, two years later she still uses it. When I purchased it it was $99 and I felt it was well worth the money, so buying it at this price is a steal. The screen is small but that's fine for little eyes they don't need too many distractions."
2,"Awful messages to children, and no stickers","My daughter chose this one not only for the cooking storyline but also for the stickers as written on the front cover of the DVD only to find they were not included. Aside from that she likes it.I however find it insipid and the songs grating. The story was terrible and the attitude that babies are a pain and big girls are great disgusting. On top of that, the food that was cooked is not even slightly healthy. I know they are all named after desserts so it should have been a tip off, but I would have thought that surely healthy eating would be a part of the message. I won't be buying my daughter another Strawberry Shortcake DVD."
3,"good, but others are better","My two year old loves ""Strawberry Cupcake"" as she calls her. This dvd didn't hold her interest near as much as some of the others in this series. I reccomend ""Meet Strawberry Shortcake"" and the one about find Spring. Those two are watched frequently at our house, and she can't get enough of the songs on those."
4,"Classic Piece, Love the style","I got high marks for this gift. Looks so victorian.Well built and beautiful vanity. The stool is very comfortable, the style is great , the price was fantastic."
1,It is impossile to get it assembled,"Do not waste your time and money with this. The package consists three main items, Chair, Mirror and the desk. You are supposed to use the screws (included) to attach the mirror on the desk. However, it is impossible to do so.... Either the screws are too short or the wood is not dense enough to hold the screw tight or both. Very disappointed with this item."
1,Disappointing movie needed a real director,"The director Mira Nair was out of her league in this movie. She is a third rate director who has made documentaries and chick flicks. ""Amelia"" is an empty chick flick (Travel! Romance! Gere!) The treatment of the navigator Fred Noonan at the end is terrible.This is a mess and a waste of time."
5,I'll Be Your Mirror,"Wow!Beautiful!I don't get it but... who cares?! The dancing is amazing and beautiful and like nothing else. The set is amazing and beautiful and like nothing else. The clothes are amazing and beautiful and like nothing else. The dancers themselves are amazing and beautiful and like nothing else. The music is amazing and beautiful and like nothing else.In fact, the music is really as amazing as the dance. Reworkings by David Lang (a minimalist) of Velvet Underground songs, it made me go back and listen to that 60's album. The new songs are just as effective and true to the lyrics as the old, but in a completely different way.Not to distract from the unbelievable dancing though...Check it out!"
2,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to view this movie. I was disappointed mainly because with the high level actors playing in this movie, I was expecting something great. The movie felt ""amateurish"" which is probably a reflection of the quality of the director and not the actors. In the hands of a good director, this movie had the potential to be very good...but it was not.This one will gather dust on my DVD collection shelf. I will not look at it again and do not recommend it.SorryAmelia [Blu-ray]"
2,PASS ON THIS ONE,I lasted through 25 minutes of this film while doing weights. The basic problem with this film was that it was too safe and ho hum. I expected more drama and better flight visuals. I didn't get it. The budget for this was $40M but it only made a bit under $20M at the Box Office. Anybody surprised?CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; STORY/PLOTTING: D plus to C minus; WHEN WATCHED: January 2012; OVERALL GRADE: C minus to C.
1,First movie I ever walked out on,"Never in my 34 years have I ever walked out on a movie, but I did with Amelia. So I guess you should take this review with a grain of salt since I only saw about 45 minutes of the movie. But man were those 45 minutes BAD!!! I usually like Hilary Swank, but her acting in this movie was just...weird - as if Amelia Earhart had Assberger's or something. Her acting was so stilted and wooden that it was really hard to relate to the character. There's no way anyone actually talks that way, unless there's something wrong with them.As for the story itself...it just didn't go anywhere - or if it did eventually, it took longer than 45 minutes. I can't really say much more about it because I can't even remember what happened in those 45 minutes, either because nothing in particular happened, or it was so bad that I blocked it out. This movie was so bad it almost makes it worth watching to marvel at its badness...but not quite."
3,Amelia,"It's a good movie, but I think I waited to long to see it. I expected more drama than I got. I was a little disapointed with the movie."
2,"Boring, Dull Acting and Uninspiring","The story was mediocre at best. The acting was unrealistic. The entire movie was long, drawn-out and depressing. At best this is a portrayal of a woman that lived only for herself and her foolish ambition got her killed."
4,A great Satchmo concert from the 1950's !!!!,"Add this gem to your collection ASAP. A great concert recording from 1956, recorded at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. Players include, Louis Armstrong, Trummy Young, Edmund Hal, Billy Kaye, Arvell Shaw, Barrett Deems and Velma Middleton. Great Satchmo standards, and even greater showmanship by the All-Stars. If you need a fix of good ole down the river jazz then this is your medicine. Very good HI-Fi quality vintage recording for the period, especially for a concert recording! Includes 16 tracks to keep you entertained for well over an hour. Great stuff, great performances and great music from 'Pops' and his players!!!"
1,Hapkido ? Self Defense ?,"As a student of the martial arts and a fighter of mixed martial art matches, I am famaliar with self defense techniques. This book fails to demonstrate effective techniques of self defense. If this is Hapkido, I question its reality based reputation. I have trained with Hapkido masters and the techniques shown in the book are not similiar to those I know."
1,Doberman should be ashamed!,"I didn't buy this from Amazon, but feel that anyone looking here to purchase one should be warned. This is at best is a toy and should be avoided at all costs. The range of the sensor says up to 15 feet, but It takes being anywhere from 3-8' to trigger, and this distance does fluctuate and as stated the best I can get is 8 foot. The most disapointing thing is the little speaker for the siren/chime. My kids leapfrog radio has a louder speaker than this. The chime is poor at best and the siren is laughable. The manual states 100db of output, and I work in the audio industry and know that this could never be this loud even if lightning struck it. Honestly my speakerphone on my cellphone is about as loud.Doberman wasted their time and my money. False advertising possibly."
5,East Coast Hardcore Uprising Above the Rest,"Everbody knows that the East Coast has the best punk/ska/everything else in the world. This CD glorifies all that is great about the hardcore boys and girls in the east. Against All Authority demonstrates how they can take over your mind and put you on brain damaging amphetamine and Kill Your Idols gives you an anthem about today's youth that noone else can compare with. You should buy this CD because if you dont, youre just not punk enough."
5,All songs are great on this album,"I totally agree with the other reviewer; (by now there is only one).I don't have very much to add, except that this album is enjoyable from start to end.It is not one of these albums where there is only one or two great songs and you can throw away ther rest.It has something very distinctive and original.This kind of music does not loose it's quality over time.Somme jazzy influences, but the album can really be classified into pop, or progressive music, or progressive rock.Sounds like an English band. (I don't know where they come from)Anyway, full of swing(ing) energyFeels really good to me.(I own an old vinyl)And have a nice day, by the way"
4,Great album,"A great album. If one was looking for a musical label, I would call it jazz prog. Only Dave Lawson seems to have gone on to greater heights but his band mates are more than competent.Look out for the 2001 Made in Australia release on the Progressive Line label. It has 5 bonus ""live"" tracks from 1971 (complete with corny intro's):Give A Little LoveHoly PadlockMore RainConcerto For BedspringsLove YouThe latter two originally recorded by ""Web"""
5,One of Bobby's Best,"I have been listening to this album since 1967 and still can't get enough of hearing the great songs on it. I have it on vinyl and CD.Every track is great, particularly this version of ""St. James Infirmary""If you are a Bland fan, make this a must have for your collection."
3,it's ok,"This book is alright if you have never spent time in a gym with somebody who knows what they are doing. It's a good place to start but know that there are many more things you can learn. Spend a little dough and invest in a couple of sessions with a personal trainer that can work with you and develop a program for your SPECIFIC goals.Also, be forwarned, the rubber bands that were included do not have handles. Go to a local sporting good store or gym and get some with the handles. They are much more usefull."
3,Meh,"I was hoping to get practical information on viable alternatives. Unfortunately, there were many included where job growth was expected to be slow. In addition, there were many jobs that required further schooling although the author DID NOT clearly indicate which ones.I wanted a book to tell me about viable alternatives for teachers which would not require me to go back to school. I was a bit disappointed and will continue looking."
3,"so, so","The comparisons of ancient heathen writings to the Bible are forced, giving the distinct impression that the author was trying to justify the book's title any which way he could.What the book does show is that there is no comparison between Monotheism and paganism. One strives for nobility, the other gives free reign to people's beastly side. Heathen gods are servants who are highly valued by their masters. Given sufficient propitiation, they are expected to help with the worshiper's material needs: fertility, success in war, and prosperity. Some long-lasting pagan cultures discovered that justice, kindness, and humility are good for the individual and good for society, so they practice some forms of these virtues, but for no other reason than self-interest. It's a start, but it becomes clear by the book's end that paganism and Monotheism are choices and they tell us much about the character of the people who choose them."
5,Worked for us !,"Since we have a daughter, we wanted next one to be preferably a boy. After doing some reading, I was convinced on Shettle method and purchased this book here (refer below link). I used this book in conjunction with ClearBlue fertility monitor to identify the peak time of fertility. Based on Shettle method, timing is critical in choosing between girl and a boy.On the target day with first attempt, my wife became pregnant and last week scanning shows it is a boy. Either way we would've loved the baby. I am happy that both Shettle method and ClearBlue together worked in our case.We followed the monitor 2 months prior to actual date so that it would learn the cycle pattern. It is easy to use and easy to follow.http://www.amazon.com/How-Choose-Sex-Your-Baby/dp/0767926102/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=books&qid;=1235772038&sr;=8-1"
1,Way Overpriced Defective Product,"For such a simple electronic product, they are WAY over-charging their customers.The monitor I received is defective. I don't know if it's because the seller shipped it in a paper envelope from overseas (the sticks were completely squashed upon arrival) or because the product simply doesn't work. I also bought Ovuquick on the same day just to compare the results, Ovuquick works perfectly.I never understand why the ClearBlue Easy menu says if you hold it in a stream of urine, it will take 3 seconds. But if you submerge it in a cup of urine, it's 15 seconds. Should it be the other way around?I think the only good thing about this product (and why some people have successful results) is because it forces you to start testing on day 6. Sometimes I missed my ovulation day because I tested too late (day 10). But this has absolutely nothing to do with the quality of the product."
3,Its okay,My dogs chewed on these things so much there was nothing much left after two weeks. Good for dogs that like chew toys but didn't last long.
2,My dog was disinterested in this toy.,"My dog had no interest in chewing this toy. I wish she did, but she much prefers squeaky toys, bones, hooves, and my shoes (unfortunately). She likes plastic but not nylabones--prefers plastic hangers."
3,Ok...but large is large,"While these are puppy teething rings, this is a large size (and heavy for puppy mouths), so buyer beware of the size you are purchasing. I have seen smaller ones in retail stores, and I wish now I had bought them. Maybe one day, when my puppy is full grown at 60 lbs, will he enjoy these."
2,Hole in Glove,"the gloves came with a hole in them. I think the wife just got a new pair locally since she needed to use them that week, and will probably not deal with returning them"
3,Huntress origin touched up,"Greg Rucka touches up the Huntress's (Helena Bertinelli's) origin without ruffling too many feathers. The plot is a good one here except for being a little too transparent. The inclusion of the Question and Richard Dragon seemed unnecessary and didn't really add anything to the story. I would have much rather seen more Nightwing or Robin but I can understand why Rucka didn't have more of them. The art, by Rick Burchett is straight ahead classic DC Comics art that actually could be taken from almost any decade. Not bad certainly but not spectacular. Overall a decent read for Huntress fans."
5,"Opened Mind, Spiritual Recovery","I lived most of my life with sort of an unconscious understanding that I was missing something, things didn't make sense, and I couldn't get my mind around what exactly it was. Then, this book was brought into my life.Some folks might find some of the material hard to digest, but read it through. Take what you like and leave the rest. Doing that changed my life, maybe yours will be too."
5,What took me so long...,"What took me so long to discover this phenomenal book. Although I am always very skeptical of this type of litterature, I must admit that I was moved, touched and guided by this book. I heard about Tome 1 almost 10 years ago, but the title was too ""religious"" for my own beliefs.Well, let me tell you this. This is NOT a religious book. This is an illuminating book, no matter what ""clan"" you belong to. In fact, I wish every religious leader and every human being would read this book and realize the thruth that it contains. We would live peacefully and happy forever and ever.Francois J.Composer"
4,Recommended for a different reason,"This book, in combination with mere Christianity by CS Lewis, made me realise that Jesus is who He says He is. King of Kings and Lord of Lords and my personal Saviour.I recommend that you read the only planet first and then Mere Christianity."
4,"Very original, interesting, but had technical errors.","Chasing the Bard is a very original, interesting read.I expected it to be a retelling of A Midsummer's Night Dream. It's not, but there are characters borrowed from the play. It feels as if you already know them and it ""anchors"" the plot line.I can't give it five stars because of the horrible editing. (At least in the Kindle version.) There are so many errors, it became distracting. There are random symbols around, the characters' thoughts are inconsistent in formatting (sometimes they're italicized, sometimes they're not. Sometimes they have no formatting or punctuation to mark them and the book is suddenly written in first person. What?) Dialogue of two characters are butted up against each other with no space or indentation.There are times when the writing is a little muddy, but overall a decently executed book (save for the mentioned errors).Overall, I liked it and would recommend it to others."
3,Just missed the mark,"I'm forcing myself to finish this and know I have the next one to read as well. It's not a bad book just doesn't grab you and make you keep reading. The premise of the story is a very good one. William Shakespeare having some Fae blood, falling in love with the warrior queen of Fae, etc. Great story line but it needs more spark."
4,great buy,"i researched this item and couldnt wait to buy it. once i got it it was everything i that i hoped it would be. i love my pictures, videos, and music, so now that i can have all of them with me whenever i want im very happy. plus if im near a wireless hot spot i can surf the net!! what more could any one ask for in a media device? the ony reason why i dont give it five stars is because of all the extra plugins and accessories that come at an extra cost, but even that makes the archos more customizable.overall ths is a great buy>:}"
5,"A Charming, Well-written and Illustrated Fictional Story","I really enjoyed this book which I found on our local library shelf, and intend to buy a copy for myself. It would make an excellent gift.It is a gem. Charming, well-told story. Beautiful, pastel-colored illustrations that greatly add to the charm.I once worked in the old Time-Life Building in Rockefeller Center, New York City, and looked down on the Christmas Tree eight years running, but I would have enjoyed this book if I had never seen the The Tree from on high and at ground level."
5,A fantastic book for the Christmas season!,I listened to this book on cassette and was moved beyond belief. It was such a heart warming story and could bring tears to ones eyes. I loved it and would recommend it for all young and old alike.
2,Disappointed,"The chips came quickly and they were fresh, but they really need more garlic and onion flavoring. I probably won't order this again."
5,Excellent Cookbook,"This book shows pictures and clearly explains what the food is (and its in portuguese too). Makes a great gift and has all of the traditional portuguese dishes, clearly ordered in simple sections."
2,Just too bland,"Bought this thinking it would be nice to hear Steve do some blues inflected jazz, but it's just way too mellow and bland. I'd call it ""muzak"". Yes the musicianship and production are first rate and Steve runs through a few very watered down T-Bone licks here and there, but I was disappointed. It's good background music, but not something you's put on the CD player to sit down and specifically listen to. Use it as background music at your next dinner party."
4,"strange, hard to follow, pay close attention when viewing.",leilani sarellle is great in this film. too bad she has retired from the screen. does anyone know what shes doing or will she return to movies?
5,john denver,"When I first asked my mom if she had any old John Denver LPs she simply laughed, and said that his music was much to country for what I would like. however, I found my way to the library, and didn't regret it.This is one of John Denver's best, to say it in the most basic form. His voice has never been so beautiful, the lyrics never so heartfelt. It is so pure, just what music should be. It reminds us that somewhere in our busy lives of late-night meetings at work and violence in the papers every day, that there is still good in the world, if we just except it, and let it into our hearts.Never thought that you'd hear that coming from one of those ""cynical-generation-Xers"" did you? I can tell you personally that while some people may call it sappy, or sacharine, it is a truely beautiful album. Even though listen to all different styles of music, i hold John's very close to my heart, and I'm sure you'll do the same."
1,Who Buys This Stuff Anyway?!?!?!,"yo yo yo!!! Wut upp mah peepz?!?! YO dees noo nellie reelees iz DOPE!!?!@ it be off da heezy fo sheezy?!! me n mah homez bummp to dis in da prrkin lott of mah skool! All da girliez beeeeee imprezd! didd i menshun i bee a ritch whyt boyeee frum da subburbzzzz!!!???!!!Just kidding. If there were a scale to measure how good an album is; 1 (worst) to 100 (best); this would be in the negatives. Talk about your all-time intellectually-devoid releases. Did I mention studies show that the majority of the audience of this trash are suburban white kids? It's a sordid state of affairs. In fact, it's so pointless and dumb, I'm just gonna stop reviewing it here.I can see the hundreds of ""Not Helpful"" votes already..."
2,I would have rather seen a CD with new songs,"Sometimes remix CD's aren't too bad. I was excited to hear Nelly's ""Da Derrty Versions: The Reinvention"". However after hearing a few songs, I felt the originals were better. I would have rather had Nelly come out with a new CD. I love his work and own his CDs, but this last one was kind of diappointing :( Maybe next time!"
1,Worse Remixes,"Some people are not meant to make remixes, i just couldnt get into the album at all. The Hard Rock Air Force Ones Beat was horrible and the Pimp juice wasnt no better Ron I. can do a lot better then that. The new songs are cool i like them and the batter up Remix, and the #1 Remix and the E.I ft. E-40 other than that all the rest suxs. worst money i have ever spent on a cd.Not worth your money at all dont waste it"
1,Disturbing,I was disgusted that they were first cousins. That they looked alike only made it worse. Nothing else in the book makes up for this deficit. I didn't care for any of the characters and I was not amused. I ended up throwing this book away and I did not buy the rest of the novels in the trilogy.
4,"Intrigue, sex, romance, and wealth, with humor thrown in!","This book was terrific! Duchess was, at the beginning, aloof but very appealing, you felt everyone's desire to protect her. Marcus was immediately appealing, even as a young man. The treasure was just touched upon until the middle of the book, and then you were on the edge of your couch! The interwoven family connections were a bit confusing but, again, by about the middle you're really into all of it, and the family just falls into place. The ""monster"" that they speak of is a complete surprise, which makes it more delicious! I already have The Nightingale Legacy and cannot wait to get started!"
2,Inaccurate sizing,Extremely large and baggy. They are not true to the sizes recommended by the sizing chart. The material is also very thin.
4,Definitely works,"I did NOT know you needed to purchase the pysillum (spelling) husks in order to use this but if you dont you may be constipated regardless of how much water you drink. With that being said, if you make the b&p shake as suggested by other reviewers, it should work to clean you out as long as you drink enough water. I personally dont think you need to drink as much as the instructions suggest, especially for a little woman like me who is barely 100 lbs but you definitely need to drink MORE than you normally would."
1,What a waste!,The authors were very wise to retain their anonymity. This at least leaves some room for speculation about the specific parentage of the worst stories - in a body of work that was bad to mediocre at best. The concept may have sounded great - but the end result was a total disappointment at every level.
5,still the best,"Even though they are long gone, Will and Arial Durant still Rock. I have been in love with philosophy for twenty years now and this is still my favorite. Truth doesn't change with time."
3,my view of YB-49 Flying Wing.mr.Noell,"from the time i was about 12 yrs.old i didn't remember what happen to the flying wing.to myself then it had a U.F.O.,look to it.and then a T.V.came on the history channel came on with the story of this wonderful look wing.then i found this technical manual,on the inner workings of the wing.a manual anyone now can understand.this manual puts you in the pilot's set.and at age 59,i still enjoy the total look of the flying wing.and i'm very sorry not one of the full size wing did not survive until now.so we all could see first hand all the inner workings and real size of the flying wings.and to know now that with more work on the technical workings of the wing it would have work army air force of the times.any one who enjoys the YB-35 to the YB-49 should take a look at thing detailed pilot's manual of the flying wing.i also have a small model of the YB-35, with a wing span of 11"" long. along with manual to really enjoy.this view by Mr.Noell.2/8/08"
5,Lord Jesus!,"Wow. This Girl Is Amazing. She Has The Voice that has officialy put her in the Diva Court with the amazing voices of Aretha, Whitney Houston, Beyoncé, and now Tarralyn. Thats how good she is! She could have had better material but this material is just as good. THe Best songs are The Soaring ballad ""Remedy"", The Powerful ""Up Against All Odds""', Raggae brushed ""Fly Away"", and the one ballad where she sounds the most like Mrs. Houston is On the beautiful ballad ""Made For You"". Her new single ""Baby U Know"" is Crazy. You will love it!"
2,NOT THE BEST FOR TARRALYN,"This amazing voice did not get quality producers on this cd. I'm very dissapointed. They should have gotten Baby Face or Jimmy Jam, etc. Her voice is too good to be waisted on songs that have no substance. Personally, I think she should sing what she is called to do and that's GOSPEL MUSIC!!! I do wish her the best and to the Record Company (Casablanca), YOU CAN TREAT HER BETTER THAN THAT!!!"
3,15-Piece Crowfoot Wrench - not great,"Case is nice. Wrenches look fine, but there are no detents to hold the wrenches onto the extension. They will fall off some extensions with little more than gravity. If you are bumping them around while maneuvering into tight spaces (where you need these) they will have a tendency to fall off. I decided to keep them but would probably not buy them again."
1,NO,"Having spent a good deal of time in the Hebrides AND loving the overture by itself, I was looking forward to the combination of music and scenery. Most of the DVD is filmed from a boat across endless water with musical accompaniment. I wasted my money and will return to my CD and private photographic collection to conjure memories of these lovely islands."
3,A very ODD collection,"This is the strangest collection of videos for a superstar with so many hits under his belt. I can only assume that the reason for so many key tracks being left out is that they were tied in to motion pictures; and perhaps there wasn't sufficient licensing to release those videos at the time. (?)The good news is that Warner Brothers has now released DVD's of every Prince movie that include every video from that album/film. (Purple Rain, Under The Cherry Moon, Grafitti Bridge, and the 2-disc edition of Batman.) These discs help fill in the missing links for the most part- with his BIGGEST hits.So the track listing presented here may feel spotty, but it is the only place I know of to get these videos on disc. Let's hope that one day Warner Brothers will release a complete video collection, spanning from 1978 to 1993!"
2,A Prince DVD WITHOUT 'Purple Rain'?!!!--Unacceptable!,"The DVD was okay, but I never would have bought this had I realized that it was missing the video for 'Purple Rain'--possibly Prince's greatest hit of all time!"
2,He's [playing] us again!,"Prince at one time was one of the most consistent, prolific artists. His output in the 90's & now this new century is weak. Here is a collection of a thimbleful of his existing videos. Some great, some total [bad] (Peach, Cream, 7) & some edited short (Controversy, I Would Die 4 U). There are unfortunately so many videos missing from this collection (Sexuality, Let's Work, Delirious, Let's Pretend We're Married, Automatic, When Doves Cry(!), Let's Go Crazy, Take Me WIth You, America, Mountains, Girls & Boys, Anotherloverholenyohead, I Wish U Heaven, Batdance, Party Man, Thieves In The Temple & who knows how many other videos he's made! What's going on? I hope someone out there knows there are a lot of Prince fans waiting for something more complete. May u live 2 c the dawn? May we live 2 c something good released!"
2,This DVD is missing tons of videos!,"There are a few good videos here, but most of them are MISSING such as: When Doves Cry, Let's Go Crazy, Mountains, Girls & Boys, Scandalous, Partyman, Batdance, Thieves In The Temple, Glam Slam, and I Wish U Heaven. Plus some of the earlier ones are missing such as: Why U Wanna Treat Me So Bad?, Automatic, and Sexuality. You have his absolute WORST videos in this set! This set makes me mad as #$%@!"
4,Great,Great to see some of my old favourite Prince videos again. It is also a shame to see some of them not in such as Purple Rain - surely that is one of his greatest. I really enjoyed this dvd though and recommend it to a Prince fan.
2,his music is his genius not videos,"with the exception of when doves cry,raspberry beret and maybe a couple of more videos aren't prince's strongest suit.with him it's music only."
3,Shells fall off,"This did not work as well as I expected. We used corn tortillas, coated each side with a light cookie spray and set them on the racks and into the oven. Things seemed to be going fine. Then we smelled burning. The tortillas slip off the rack and can slide through the cracks. We had one burning in the bottom of the oven with now way to get it out since the oven was hot. We did get them to work but turned them upside down and have to put them on a pan to get them to work. I was a little bummed a few months later when I saw on one of my favorite blogs that you can get the same effect by just draping the tortillas over the racks in the oven. That is a FREE option. Don't waste your money on these. Although you can make them work, the oven rack is already there and won't cost you a thing!"
1,worthless,"Product sounded great, but the tortillas just slide off and there are gaps in between each of the shell making shapes so when the tortillas slide off they fall between these sections on to he bottom of the oven and burn. I even then tried warming up the tortillas a little on a skillet so they would lay nicely on shell arches which works until you pick up the rack to put it in the oven, at that point they just slip off again. Then we tried putting a cookie sheet on top of the rack after the tortillas were on in hopes that would help hold them in place, which didnt work either."
2,Disappointed...not for moms who already have kids...,"I am experiencing my second pregnancy and this time it's twins. I was excited to buy this book thinking that it would calm my fears as other reviews said that this was the least nerve-racking as far as expecting multiples are concerned.This book DOES NOT address if you already have a child--which I do, a toddler. It is merely her experience as a mom of twins and she provides little ""strategies"" for handling the ins and outs of everyday experiences. I was hoping for suggestions juggling a toddler and twins...If you're a second (and third) time mom, this book is not for you. In fact, it will make you more anxious--comparing your size to normal pregnancy, stressing how you should rest and elevate your feet--you just can't if you have other kids...Plus the ""medical"" advice is mediocre at best...don't waste your money if this is your second pregnancy..."
1,Good only for first-time moms who are plain vanilla and live in the burbs,"I would not recommend this book if you already have been pregnant and have a child - nothing enlightening here for you because the author can't compare a singleton pregnancy to a twin, since this is her first time around. I also would not recommend it if you enjoy any kind of non-mainstream lifestyle, if you live in an urban setting, if you have a very small abode, or if you regularly eat ethnic foods. You won't find helpful tips for any of these circumstances (how to travel on a subway, how to live without a car, etc). Also not useful if you plan to use a midwife. It's just really hard to see yourself in her advice if you do not lead a lifestyle very similar to hers."
4,Twinspiration,"It was in good condition, I think my daughter will find most of her questions answered by this handy book."
5,Not a scary thought in it,"Too many books about pregnancy and in particular, multiple births, have scary facts and issues that really make you not want to read them. This book is funny, amusing, and very informative. Some of the things mentioned in her book worth looking forward to... ""Turn the computer off"", ""Baby's first bloodshed (daddy did it!)"" and all the oops' and laughs along the way. It makes up for all those horror stories that seem to pervade the pregnancy shelves of every book store."
4,Works Great Right Out of the Box,"As long as you follow the instructions and load the driver CD before connecting the adaptor, it works great.Only snag I had was my Norton Antivirus s/w prevented the installation without supplying any warnings. Turned off the antivirus s/w, it loaded up and works great!No problems uploading/downloading files to my Moto phone, even when it was in the next room."
3,Cell Phone,Not too clear on how to set up this device with my cell phone. Not very good instructions
2,Doesn't work with S9 Motorola Headset,"This is probably not a bad device but it doesn't have A2DP capability and therefore is not able to pair with S9 Motorola bluetooth headphones. It works great with my cellphone and PDA, but I have to return it because I got it, so that I could listen to music wirelessly or talk on Skype."
3,Disappointing OLEVIA TV,"A lot disappointed with this TV. First, because OLIVIA is such a new brand, they have not yet produced remote codes that allow you to progran your dish remote to control this TV....which means searching for more than one remote to turn on TV and sattelite box and control functions on TV. Also, the blue power light on the front of the TV could land a plane....and it stays lit all the time! I use this TV for my bedroom, so I now have to sit something in front of the light or it keeps me awake. I bought a Toshiba at the same time I bought this one and it is much easier to use and has more innovative functions like 1/2 mute. The picture quality is okay on the OLIVIA, but I can't seem to get beyond the other annoyances. Delivery from the west coast to east coast took nearly 3 weeks."
1,Be Careful,"Bought this unit at Target for my elderly mother in law. Being an engineer, I thought it would take a few minutes to set up. Boy was I wrong! The biggest problem is that there are no remote control codes for this set that work with Time Warner Cable. It took a couple of hours of trying almost every code on the Time Warner sheet. Gave up and went home to search the internet, Found many people having same problem. All said there was no solution except to go out and buy an additional remote with a""learning"" function. Solving Olevia's problem by me spending more money didn't make much sense. The other problem is the menu/setup function is very poor and not easy to use. An 83 year old cannot do it.Solution- Took it back to Target and for a few dollars more bought a 26"" Magnavox that works perfectly and is easy to navigate. People who solve Olevia's engineering problems by spending more of their own money, are only helping to keep a marginal manufacturer in business longer than they should be."
2,E t T u ?,An interesting summary of the most significant events in the life of Julius Caesar. A very easy read. Good supplement to other readings on Julius Caesar.
4,A bit large for normal sized tortillas,"I purchased this and it's large. We buy a lot of our tortillas in a normal size so they tend to be about 10"" in diameter. As they cook in this large shell, they shrink and the walls become a lot smaller than expected. We resorted to purchasing the larger tortillas but they don't come in as many flavors.It's still a great product!"
5,Browns well,Been wanting to try these for a while. Hesitated because of other reviews on other brands. Sturdy works well. Holds the largest tortilla. The top edges are well rounded not sharp like some other pans I've read about. Do need to pierce or weight done the tortilla so it won't puff up. Satisfied with product.
2,"move on, christian soldiers","The author clearly choose to forgo such things as character and detail of description in creating this short, yet way too long, epic of astoundingly bad proportions. The aesthetic is of his choosing, but it's simply not very good, IMHO. A very poor man's take on the picaresque tale.Some sentences were quite pleasing, however. And the scenes in the Cadiz prison with the rats are also good. On the whole, though, please do not waste your time. Move on to some of the author's other work, which is probably better since it could be no worse."
4,Classic Chisel-stuff,"After all the tired reunions of the 90's it's so refreshing to listen to these guys. They still have it. It may not be Chisel's best album yet but it's not far from it. Listen to ""Way Down""-a new ""When The War Is Over"". Songs like ""Things I Love In You"", ""Mr Crown Prosecutor"" and ""Water Into Wine"" sounds like they could have been written in the 80's and produced in the 90's. My favorite track though is the hidden 15th song, ""Once Around The Sun"", which apparently was meant to be the album-title at one point. Can't stop playing this album..."
4,Very cute!,"Very cute shoes, but like the other comment said, buy a size up. I had to return mine because they were way to small..... but they are cute!!"
2,A Warning!,"Indeed this new dictionary is quite a well put together piece, well arranged and aesthetically appealing. And these are its good qualities. Sadly, having set out to create a dictionary of Chinese word etymologies, this editor fell prey to the seductive charm of cute graphic stories, one or several existing for each character. Since these graphic stories only attempt to explain the graphical structure of a character, making no reference to the SPOKEN word each character represents, they are fundamentally wrong (linguistics 101 folks; Chinese isn't exempt from the universal laws of writing). And misleading for the beginning student, the editor references many legitimate sources of Chinese word etymology, yet himself STILL ignores their content in favor of the fluffy stuff. Ah, and what we have lost to popular appeal...you have been warned!"
4,See It!,"I'll confess. I only knew about this because the singer David Ault is in it and mentioned it at an appearnace here years ago. Check him out under Popular Music.I liked it although the sound quality of the film seems to be off in the beginning.Regardless, it has some humorous touching moments and characters that can remind us of the misfits in our own family."
5,Pirate fam,"My daughter has hung this up in her room. I think it's ugly but she is a fan of Pirates of the Caribbean and loves this ""skull."" He talks and tells jokes and you can cut him off so it doesn't wake you at night."
2,Strong cast only!,"The Clearing delivers strong acting performances by Robert Redford, Helen Mirren and Willem Dafoe. But the kidnapping plot and script writing lacks development.I never heard anything about this film beforehand. So I watched without expectations. It came up short in the entertainment value. The kidnapping storyline was drawn out to a full length movie. Ninety minutes was the cutoff budget line I guess.The film look and quality is consistent with trying to experiment with directorial techniques. That feel for a film and plot lacking was disappointing. The strong acting is not enough to recommend this movie as a must see. Their strong cast dramatic performance was wasted. Wannabe actors should see this film for facial and body language techniques. I don't know how much adlib was allowed during filming, but I'm guessing there was not much freedom.I would recommend to rent DVD only. Purchase this DVD if you are a budding actor."
1,Avoid The Cleaering at all costs!,"The Clearing goes no where! Don't be fooled that this movie will be another Spy Game. [Great flick]. The Clearing poses a number of hypotheses and numerous clues, none of which lead anywhere or even to each other. When the movie closes you say to yourself, ""Darn, two hours wasted, stolen from my life."" Avoid even for free. I warned ya."
5,IT IS A MUST READ FOR THE SICK MINDED.,IT REALLY MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT THAY WERE THINKING OF BEFORE THAY KILLED THEMSELFS.
2,OK for a first book on relationships and self-awareness,"This book really didn't tell me anything new. If you are at the beginning of a journey in self discovery and relational awareness, it's great. If you have done much emotional work, you will probably find it redundant."
3,Getting the Love You want,"Outdated material in the 21st century, although there is something to the authors' ""imago"" theory of mate selection--that we unconsciously choose someone who closely resembles one of our parent's negative characteristics when we are in the process of mate selection. Like I woefully say my daughter married her father. I tried to prevent this ""Imago"" event believe me, but she was too 'in love"" to listen to me. The authors just tried to repackage Freud's oedipal theories--unsuccessfully I must add.Getting the Love You Want: A Guide for Couples, 20th Anniversary Edition"
1,Getting the love you want-AUDIO CASSETTE,This audio cassette was a complete waste of money!!! I could have read the front and back cover of the book and got the same information as this tape. I purchased it along with the workbook hoping that we could use the two together. That won't happen. In order to use the workbook effectively I have to buy the book and read it. The purpose of purchasing the audio tape was so we could (as a couple) listen to what Mr Harville Hendrix had to say..ya know spend some time together and still enhance our relationship. Well unless I spend more money and time to purchase the book then read it(with kids...HAHA)I will never know how good Mr Hendrix is. Complete waste of money...so disappointed.
5,Getting the love you want,"Excellent book, a different look at marriage that deals with the psychology of love. There are workshops through out the world that teach couples how to use the information taught in this book. I wish I would have found this book/CD years ago. Buy the CD and go for a long ride, It could change the way you love your partner and have you take a look at yourself."
2,WARNING! There is an edition that does not match the description!,"CAREFUL! Amazon describes ""Cocktail: The Drinks Bible for the 21st Century,"" as being 9.5"" X 8.5"". The book I received was 8""X6"". It's clearly a ""pocket"" edition or something; the text is tiny and the first section of the book is printed on lightweight paper w/ B&W; illustrations instead of color. The book sells for $285 and I got it for $48, and I wondered about that, but Amazon makes no mention of a lesser edition. Disappointing. I probably would have gotten the cheaper version, even knowing that it's a smaller, hard-to-read version, but there is NO information out there that there is even a different edition available! So watch out...if you are paying the $30-to-$70 price, you are probably NOT getting the real thing.Aside from all that....the content of the book is great, if you can read the miniscule font size."
5,Guitar-Driven Praise Rock,"This is already one of my favorite CDs, and I just got it four days ago. The lyrics are deep and heartfelt, and musically, this disc is up there with anyone. There are some rockers (""King"", ""The Answer to the Question""), some slow rockers (""Overdue""), and some that fall in between. All the songs, though, exhibit consistent driving rock songs that are meant to help us more greatly appreciate the God in heaven who loves us so much. Do not hesitate in picking up this offering from Tree63. I waited a while to get it, and now that I have it, I wish I'd have picked it up sooner!"
4,Great!,"Tree 63 is one of my favorite band simply because their music pounds my heart everytime I listen to them. They cover some the songs that have been redone by many bands and artists out there, for example ""Blessed Be Your Name"". Another artist to cover that song is Matt Redman, but his version is more mellow and slow, where Tree 63's version is more upbeat and rockish. My favorite has got to be ""King"", high energy and it makes my want to go out and play music.If you enjoy worship music, and along bands like Third Day, Newsboys, By The Tree, Casting Crowns, and Switchfoot try Tree 63."
5,Excellent learning opportunities,"Pleny of activities to keep my almost 5 year old busy. He likes the activities, I like the different levels of difficulty."
2,"New Heart CD: ""Little Magazine""","For my own enjoyment, and to satisfy my own curiosity, I burned a CD combining the best elements of Heart's LITTLE QUEEN and MAGAZINE albums, which, as everyone knows, were intended to be released as one record in 1977. By doing this, I believe I've created one of the great lost albums of the 1970s. This is it:""LITTLE MAGAZINE""Side One:1. Barracuda2. Love Alive3. Sylvan Song4. Dream of the Archer5. Here Song6. Kick It OutSide Two:1. Heartless2. Little Queen3. Treat Me Well4. MagazineIn my opinion, these are the best tracks from both albums, and this sequence (retaining most of the original of LITTLE QUEEN's side one) works well, keeping a balance between the rockers and the ballads. The two ""sides"" even balance: 2 is only nine seconds longer than 1. Make yourself a copy and take a listen. If you're a Heart fan, you may be amazed."
4,Wrestlemania 12,"To me Wrestlemania 12 was one of the best Wrestlemania's. It had the 1st appearences of the best superstars of today. It also brought back well known wrestler's.The matches of Wrestlemania 12 were: Iron Man Match for the WWF Title- Bret ""Hit Man"" Hart(Champion) vs. Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker vs. Diesel, Ultimate Warrior vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley accompanied to the ring by Sable, Stone Cold Steve Austin(w/ the Million Dollar Belt) vs. Savio Vega, Hollywood Backlot Brawl- Rowdy Roddy Piper vs. Goldust, Six-Man Tag Team Match- Yokozuna, Ahmed Johnson, & Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts vs. Vader, British Bulldog, and the late Owen Hart.According to the pamphlet that comes with the first 14 Wrestlemania's, Wrestlemania 12 should have had the matches The Godwinns vs. The Body Donnas for the WWF Tag Team Titles, and the Geriatric match- Huckster vs. Nacho Man. In my Version those 2 matches were not on the tape."
1,Book Review,I was very disappointed with this book. Robert Agnew made this book very dry and should have had another editor read this book.
2,Parcells Knows Football,"This is a fantastic book if you want to know how to manage a football team, or even motivate a business team. Bill Parcells has obviously never worked in the business world, though, because his examples relating football to business were very weak and not helpful for use in the office. It is an enjoyable read, however."
4,A good Holiday heat flash.,A nice holiday present to share with those women of a certain age...Really got to laugh and feel their pain duringholiday situations. This whole series is a pleasure to read-and I am glad to know all the gals in this series- The Hot FlashClub.
2,Creates foam,"I thought that the larger holes in the screen would just let in small bits of fruits/vegetables in my juice. I juice carrots, apples and beets. The larger hole screen just produced more foam in the juice. I wanted juice and bits of produce in my juice, not more foam to drink. I didn't like it. So I just went back to the screen that came with my juicer."
3,"Great, but...","Handy dandy, works almost as expected.when connected to the PC it shows up as a drive, so you don't need any software for that, but it records files in a proprietary (.voc) format that can only be played or converted to a .wav file by the RCA software.There aren't any freeware converters or codecs for this type of file (the RCA .voc file, not the soundblaster version)so, if like me, you were looking for something that would easily enable you to email files, look for something that records in .mp3 or .wav."
1,INFERIOR BOOTLEG RELEASE,BEWARE: THIS RELEASE IS A BLATANT BOOTLEG AND INFERIOR RELEASE OF THE YMA SUMAC CAREER ANTHOLOGY ORIGINALLY RELEASED ON BLUE ORCHID IN 1995 WHICH CONTAINS A 16 PAGE BOOKLET AND ESPECIALLY COMMISSIONED LINER NOTES. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THIS BLATANT RIP OFF!!
3,Nice pan but they rust!,"Let me start by saying I'm not your average loaf pan user. I make bread every other day. I have 2 of these pans and while they are FAR superior to their non-stick counterparts they do have a problem with rust spots. I hand wash and dry them BUT the side folds trap water and condensation in the humid Florida climate as well. I use them now only with a parchment inlay and will be likely replacing them with cast iron. I have the mini-loaf versions as well and they rust very fast- upon initial use. These took a good 6 months of heavy usage before the rust started creeping in. I must say, however, that even with the aluminum base they do not salt which is a huge asset seeing as some of my cast iron/aluminum pots salt I really appreciate that they don't!"
5,My bird sleeps here...,my bird sleeps here....obviously more comfortable than his other perches on his feet. glad i got this for my Kahuna boy. :)
2,"boring, boring, boring","As a sub myself, I thought that this would be a great book with all of the talk about it.It has almost no erotica if thats what you are looking for. The relationships with O's two masters are nothing at all like the gentle love of a true dom or master. She is used and thrown away. the book was incredibly boring and one had to wade through page after page of fluff and descripitons. Thumbs down."
3,Very sad...,"Aside from all of the abuse, humility and torture O sustains, I believe she was only going through the motions in order to be loved. That was the underlying theme of this book to me. It was sad and rather empty in terms of plot and characters aside from O. I understand she is the main character, but the others seemed to have no feelings at all. Not my first choice for others to read."
3,A strange book that must say something about the reader,"The book begins with the climactic scene, the complete submission of O to her lover and his sadistic friends. No explanation of her decision (assuming it was a concious desicion) is forthcoming. The rest of the book meanders through O's life as a submissive with little to enlighten the reader about her. The fact that this novel still sells so well and is praised by so many says something about the readers, but I'm not sure exactly what. I believe I can speak for most of the men, who likely had the same reaction I did - where do I sign up for Rene's club and short of that, where can I find someone like O for myself. The reaction of the women (assuming some of the buyers and reviewers are women) I understand not at all. If any of you would care to write and explain it to me, please do."
4,A misunderstood masterpiece.,"The story of O is, in my opinion, one of the most misunderstood novels of the modern era. It exposes the reader, who may otherwise be unfamiliar, with a sub-culture that is, at first blush, quite disturbing. However, a deeper examination of the text reveals a darker side to the human spirit which is, to some extent, within us all. Although I have not had the opportunity to read this work in its native tongue (in part due to my lack of proficiency in french), I find that the translation does retain qualities which make the novel exciting, and to some, morbidly fascinating."
1,Be careful which edition you order!,"The original ""Story of O"" is a novel. There is a comic book version by Guido Crepax which is NOT the novel. Amazon.com has mistakenly combined the reviews for the book and the comic book, which is very misleading because I wanted the novel and got the comic book!"
3,So why does she do it?,"It seems that most people end up reading The Story of O because someone tells them to.The basic premise of the story is that O's lover, Rene, sends her off to a secret chateau to have her trained in the ways of slavehood. The story evolves from there.While this book is interesting in that it gives an insight into the BDSM scene and the types of characters that may populate it, no insight is ever given into O's mind. Considering she is the main character, this is rather frustrating. Obviously she has the option to leave the relationship (and equally obviously, she stays), but we are never given the opportunity to find out exactly what she gains from her liaison with Rene, and later, Sir Stephen or whether any of her needs are met.Being in the lifestyle myself, I found that this book left many questions unanswered. Then again, I'm not into humiliation and debasement--but I would have appreciated finding out exactly what O gets from her life as a slave."
2,This is not Love!!,"I'll be honest, I couldn't make it past the first chapter. The violence, abuse and self-deprecation was too much for me to stomach. What offended me most was the use of the word Love throughout the chapter. This word was used(or should I say mis-used) by both the tortured and the torturer. Although the subject matter sickened me, the writing style and attention to detail was excellent (and scary). If you can stand it I'm sure there's something to be gained from reading this book. I personally will never know."
4,My first book of this genre...,"I have never read any books before like this, about someone choosing to be a slave and accepting punishment of a harsh physical nature. Having said that, I thought that the book was very well written, but also very graphic, so if you are faint of heart and easily horrified, this book is NOT for you. The only thing that I did not like about this book, and this is a bit nit-picky, was the ending."
1,AN AROUSING IMPACT EVEN IN THESE DAYS.,"I HAD ALWAYS WANTED, THROUGH THE MANY YEARS SINCE IT WAS PUBLISHED, TO READ THIS BOOK. I HAD ALMOST FORGPOTTEN IT WHEN I GOT IT FROM AMAZON. THE IMPACT WAS TREMENDOUS. ITS DESCRIPTIONS, THE INSIGHT ON THIS SUBMISSIVE AND YET STRONG WILLED YOUNG WOMAN IS EXTRAORDINARY. IT TAKES, PERHAPS, A WOMAN, TO UNDERSTAND THE MOST INNER SEXUAL DESIRES AD CRAVINGS OF OTHER WOMEN. I FELT , THROUGH ITS PAGES, INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH ""O"", AT TIMES SAD FOR HER, AT TIMES, COMPLETELY INMERSED IN HER TORTURES, HER WISHES, HER WANTOMNESS. ENJOYED IT A LOT AND WISH IT WOULD HAVE CONTINUED AT ROISSY."
2,Disappointing...,"I began reading Story of O because of the story behind it and the reputation it has as the pinnacle of BDSM erotic fiction. Somehow, it didn't live up to my expectations. I was sorely disappointed. I found much of it dull and very little of it a turn-on (and trust me, this is not because of the subject matter). The prose was full of convoluted run-on sentences that were crammed with em dashes on top of parentheses on top of semicolons. I don't know if that was the fault of the translation or if those are in the French, as well, but it made for some difficult reading. There were also many typos and instances of quotation marks being left off of dialogue in the edition I have. I wanted Story of O to be breathtaking and beautiful. Instead, I got an exhausting piece of work that could have stood another run or two across the editor's desk."
2,The ending is suppressed?!,I heard several references to this book and decided to read it. I wish I had known before committing time to reading it that the ending is suppressed. You are left unsure of O's fate.
5,Wonderful!,"WOW!!!! This book is truly a masterpiece. It is well written and truly convincing. It is unlike many books in this genre of literature because it is quite graphic in ""realistic"" detail. The reader comes away with a sense of amazement and a whole lot to talk about. Would someone really enjoy such treatemnt? Could you really lose your entire sense of self in order to please another human?I would recommend this book to anyone with an open mind or anyone who has the slightest interest in alt. lifestyles."
1,Barely Naughty,"I've read some nicely naughty adult books before and heard this one was great. I'd call it an ""intro"" book. It's mostly about being emotionally and physically ""owned"" and about pain. Not much time spent on erotica outside of those items. I found other books to be much more erotic because they went into detail about touching, licking, tasting, penetrating, etc. I was underwhelmed by this book. Try the sleeping beauty trilogy by Anne Rice instead!"
2,1950's,"Thats when this book was first written, so it tells you right there it is NOT graphic or very sexual. It is aboout a man who loves his girlfriend so much he makes her sleep with other men, her eyes always have to be down and she is not allowed to talk. THEY lock her up so anyone can have her. She is almost always kept naked, except in the day when she has to lift her skirt up so they can do what they do to her. It's like a S & M book that's very PLAIN not descriptive. If that helps at all."
4,On my top 10 list of L. L. books,"I've thoroughly enjoyed almost every L'Amour book I've ever picked up (and there are only a couple that I haven't read), But High Lonesome is one of my all time favorites. It's got an even better story and characters than most of his books."
1,Hard to find an average Lamour Book.,"Somehow, this book is special. It has some great shoot-out scenes and the title becomes highly significant once you read along. It is a good western read and although I am fairly new at the genre and even Lamour (have read 9 LL books)this is definitely a dusty trail you will want to follow un into the canyon."
3,So You Want To Be Like Christ?,This book is great to read and use the workbook designed for it. It helps your walk.
1,Not Very Good (return),This cookie sheet when put in a 350 degree oven smelled like toxic chemicals and ruined the food I was baking. I am returning the product as unacceptable.
4,Much quieter than Penguin 660,I love this pump so far. The Aquaclear 20 is perfect for a 29 gallon tank. Previous Penguin powerhead was awful. A pet store recommended and ordered the 660 for my 29 gallon tank. It was way too much power with no way to adjust the output. My fish were getting blown around the tank. Even worse was the vibration. Even tried rocks on top of the cover to stop the rattling. Down graded to 4 stars because the bubble valve doesn't adjust to a tiny amount of bubbles without spurting them out off and on again. You either get spurts or a LOT of bubbles. To be fair the Penguin air valve was fancier but didn't work any better.
4,Powerhead,"Powerful,compact unit.. Reverse and forward switches making this unit wonderful for enhancing beneficial bacteria in your aquarium.. Only problem I have found is its difficult to use the forward and backward switch, while in the aquarium and the switches sometimes break off"
2,Loud,"This powerhead moves water, so much so that I wish it had a lower flow rate on the low end. The real issue, though, is that it vibrates so loudly that I can hear it in other rooms. I have rigged it with padding so it's not so loud...but I shouldn't have to."
1,Meh,"This unit barely moves the water around in my 125 I have 3 filters on it I just wanted a little movement, Barely does it. Dunno if its a design flaw but I have a pulsating spray of micro bubbles coming from mine VERY ANNOYING as I love crystal clear water.. I used it for about a month and pulled it out of my 125 and going to use it on another tank since it was in my show tank and make it look like crap....."
2,Totally useless,"I bought AquaClear 70 Powerhead and the filter, however, they cannot connect together, without the filter, the power head can only disturb the water, I send emails to Amazon, they said the product didn't belong to them, they could not help me to solve the problem. I bought another brand filter. The ""Aquaclear Power Head"" and the ""Filter"" are still stored on the corner of my cabinet. My question is why the ""set"" they sold does not fit each other. This stuff waisted more than $60 of my money!"
2,Too much triviality,"Yes, this book deals with many aspects of Web Services technology.Unfortunately, the authors haven't hesitated to fill this book with a lot of triviality and white space. You'll have to read through many extensive descriptions and a lot of javascript that doesn't deserve much attention. Selecting the right object in IE or Netscape makes the presented code qualify as a Cross-Browser Framework. And when moving from javascript to java, the authors seem to be unaware of any OO methodology, sticking to static procedural implementations. Experienced java and C++ programmers will gradually loose interest when reading this book.Where other authors delightfully underline the Author's Press promise, these authors bring disappointment to the serious reader."
3,Rust pretty fast but bake well,"Lovely pans good value for money. Bake excellent pies with a flaky crust, easy to use. I washed by hand but are getting rust spots so will have to discard unless I can get them recoated."
1,Not good if you're unfamiliar with the characters,"I picked up this comic book without ever reading a Green Arrow book before. Maybe if you're familiar with the Green Arrow and the rest of the characters in the series, this would be entertaining. Also, i may be biased, as i'm not a guy and it's the guys who this is geared to. However, I found it annoying the author wouldn't take the time to include a brief synopsis regarding both plot and characters, at the beginning of the book. I had a very difficult time following what was going on. Additionally, the Green Arrow himself did not appeal to me. It just wasn't a protagonist i could care about. I must admit though, i did not actually finish this book as i decided it was not worth my time. If you've never heard of the Green Arrow before now is not the time to get into the series.Note- fellow females- check out 'Meridian' instead. It is way cool."
2,Casual reader,"I have not consistently read comics since I was a teen and now I periodically read a graphic novel every now and then. I write this review from that perspective. This is not a good story for someone not somewhat familiar with Green Arrow's history. Sorry that the critique is sort of vague but I don't want to spoil the story for other readers. I would list the Watchmen, Astro City (all volumes),Kingdom Come and Marvels as great graphic novels."
5,Dogma + DC history = GA:Quiver,"The best way to describe this is it's Oliver Queen's journey though the supernatural and DC continuity. He just came back to life, doesn't know he was dead, thinks he just finished his ""hard-traveling"" with Green Lantern and believes it's still the 70's, er, 80's. It features loads of guest stars: Batman, Arsenal, Black Canary, Conner Hawke, Deadman, Hal Jordan, Aquaman, Black Manta, Jason Blood/Etrigan, Spoiler, Superman, the rest of the JLA, a character from Smith's CLERKS cartoon and some I wouldn't want to spoil here. There's more than a fair bit of quasi-theology, continuity, and in-jokes (much like Smith's movies) but if your into that stuff or if it at least it doesn't go over your head then your in for a real treat. I don't think that this includes Green Arrow #11 which is too bad since it provides a great epilogue for the story, oh well."
5,Great!,"This is one brilliant book. I've read it in a library about four years ago, and I still a lot of it. Read it, you'll love it. Also read The Double Bass"
2,not worth it for the bonus tracks,"Aside from this being a rehash of studio material, the bonus tracks are from the same catalog. The live bonus disc contains 8 tracks from South Of Sanity. Disc one contains the only real bonus material; a live version of Dude (Looks Like A Lady) from a Westwood One broadcast. That entire show can be traded for from many collectors' websites."
5,Informational,"This is a great book to read to have a good basic knowledge on children's patterns of sleeping and should be used as a ""guideline"" to what to expect from your infant/toddler/preschooler sleeping needs as they progress."
4,Glycerine & Rosewater,What you used to be able to get in any drug store but now cannot. An excellent skin care product at a reasonable price. Would prefer larger container but the stuff is great for dry skin an moisturizing.
4,Untitled,"Beautiful pictures; not much garden advice, hence not for the beginning gardener. But herbs here I had never even heard of, and the pictures are so beguiling. Those pictures and the huge range of plants are the reason to buy this book. I intend to work my way thru alphabetically and just grow herbs. They need no fertilizer, which is purely wonderful."
2,Misled by title,"From now on I will read very carefully others' reviews of an item before purchasing. Like so many others I was dismayed when I received a 12 cup ""mini"" with nothing in the info on the web site to indicate ""mini"". I too did not want to pay for shipping back -- so I now will try the item and hope it wortks better than what some of the other reviews said. Buyer Beware!! Gene EvansChicago Metallic Gourmetware Nonstick 12-Cup Popover Pan"
1,"LIES, well, mostly","The product description provided online states that this item is made in Taiwan, but when I received it today, the product lists China as its origin. I am extremely disappointed, because I've spent the past 5+ years refusing to cook in anything made in China. I'm all for adventure, but death by poison isn't one of them."
3,No success yet,"I have attempted to make popovers twice using this pan and have failed both times. I normally have no issue with cooking/baking so not sure if popovers are just very tricky or if it is the pan, or what. Plus, it is difficult to find a recipe/cook time for making popovers in a 12 cup pan vs. a 6 cup pan which might be a factor."
1,Description,"Your description of the Popover Pan did not did not contain ""MINI"". The item I wanted was the standard size popover pan, not the mini. ""MINI"" should be added to your description."
5,Great for Yorkshire Pudding,"I love this pan. My family loves Yorkshire pudding and I can put one in the oven and have another ready to go. One of the problems with cooking these is that at high temperatures the batter sometimes sticks, but not with these pans. Also, I tend to spill on the side, but with these, I can just wipe up the counter, and not burn the pudding."
1,"Make note: It is a ""MINI!""","The product description should say that the pan is a ""mini"" popover pan- not a full sized one. It came with packaging that said so but I was unaware based on the description when I ordered. I should have read the reviews!"
1,Excellemt french bread,"To get the size and the nice crispy crust that french or Italian bread is known for, this is the best pan that I have found. I make to dough in my electric breadmaker,then form the rolls and bake in the oven. Finally got the crust I wanted."
5,buffy ruled!,"I loved Buffy The Vampire Slayer I really miss that show, here's hoping for an eventual reunion movie"
4,Two good reasons to purchase this...,"I'm going to buy this set for two specific reasons, and one general reason. The general one is, of course, that I'm a gigantic Buffy fanatic. The two specifics? Selfless and Storyteller, the two brilliant episodes of this otherwise below-average season.Then again, the season six DVDs helped me like that season when I hadn't before. Let's hope that happens again. This season started off strong, and then swerved from good to bad during the middle, and then just kinda took a nosedive towards the end. But I'll always rememebr Buffy as my favorite show of all time. Nothing could really come close."
5,"Buffy, come back","My heart is as broken as Spike's. I wish SMG had been willing to go on for a few more years. I know she thinks she's going to be a big movie star, but she's wrong. Her acting is good on the small screen, but what made this show was the ensemble, Willow, Xander, Giles, Angel and Spike. Get over yourself Mrs. Prinze"
4,"BtVS, got a really dromatic ending.","BtVS has been my fav since it's first season, Sarah michelle put on a great fight at the final Battle, though with alot of helps from the stuntwomen.in all seasons Gellar has acted really good, but the ending i'll never forget. blood, pain, vampires, demons, it was like great.Man-kind VS The VaMps.it was great and Dromatic, Actionness, and Bloody.Although the romance from Buffy&Spike;, took the most of my Attention.buffy really Rules, but now that buffy's over Angel Rules, and now Angel's over too! but i have a confidence in Kristin, and in WB, and In Whendon, they'll bring it Back, i'm Sure!I'm with Lisa & Kristin, And i hope WB & Whendon Are too."
5,Great product,"These mats will last forever or at least untill you need to buy another vehicle.This is my second set, only because the first set fit my 1999 Bronco for 5 years and also used the same ones in my F150 for 9 years.I bought a 2005 Mercury Mountaineer and I had to buy the correct mats to fit that, there molded to fit perfectly to the floor contours and have about a 1"" lip to keep melted snow, mud, anything in the mat and not on the carpet.There great if you had snow on your feet and after it melts off, the water puddles in one spot out of the way, and if you leave your vehicle outside for the night in the winter, the puddle will freeze so you can just flip the ice out and your mat is clean again.Great mats, I would buy them again if I ever get another vehicle!"
5,Take an awesome journey through Jamaican village life!,"Adisa has the amazing ability to escort you through the village of Kristoff, Jamiaca and make you ""feel"" everything that happens. You become a silent member of the village who sees everything that's natural and spritual. The sense of kinship and spirituality felt among the villagers and folklore characters is unbelievably rich. This is a book you'll want to read again and again!!!"
