1,WARNING These are LR03 1.2V AA @ AAA batteries not HR03 1.5V AA & AAA batteries,"You are being forewarned! These are LR03 1.2V batteries not HR03 1.5V batteries. That said most of the products out there require a HR03 1.5V AA batteries rating. What this means is that the LR03 1.2V batteries (which these are) will work but the will not power your electronics to its full potential in addition they will loose power much faster than the HR03 1.5V AA rated batteries. Not all AAA, AA etc batteries are the same in terms of voltage they are only the same in terms of size. Before fore warned and don't get burned like I did!"
2,Worked Once,"Received the unit on a Monday from Amazon, which provided excellent, quick service. Plugged it in, inserted 4 batteries and did a ""Refresh"" to restore them. Finished the cycle a couple days later. The next day I plugged the unit in to do another set of batteries. The unit would power up to the ""Ready"" state and then reset after about 10 seconds. This happened continously, even after inserting batteries and trying to set the operating mode. I purchased this unit because I have seen it operate and believe it has good ideas. Very disappointed in the quality of the unit since it only worked once. Will try Customer Service at La Crosse."
5,BEST CHARGER EVER,"The LaCROSSE CHARGER IS THE BEST CHARGER I HAVE.I TAKE A LOT OF UNDERWATER PHOTOS.WE DIVE EVERY DAY, WITH THE CAMERS AND THE LARGE FLASH I USE UP THE BATTERYS FAST.BUT THIS CHARGER WILL KEEP UP(BC-9009 ALPHAPOWER)RICK IN MEXICO"
4,easy to use,"I am pleased with the purchase. The charger is easy to use. It has many advanced features. It would be a 5 star if it charges C,D and 9V."
5,Useful product,"A ""must have"" in this age of battery-powered gadgets. Easy to use for recharging as also re-juvenating AAs and AAAs."
5,The BEST charger of the world.,"They lack words to describe to this excellent charger. It does not damage the batteries. It is even to overload batteries in the way fast. It avoids the effect memory of the batteries. It recovers old batteries. He is excellent. I have already acquired two, and they will not be the last ones."
5,BC-900 has no competition,"I don't understand why other chargers are so lousy when La Crosse can make this and sell it for a reasonable price. What happened to Sony, Panasonic and the other big electronic companies? IMO the BC-900 strong selling points are independent battery charging, informative screen with charging status (not dumb colored leds), and battery rejuvenating mode. The batteries that came with it worked great and was of high capacity (2400 mah). Definitely nvironmentally friendly by preventing a lot of trashed batteries!"
1,"Doesn't last, fire hazard","The charger is flimsier than it looks (feels like cheap plastic). I loved the features, but both units I bought (one for me and my sister)died after a year or so. My sister's made her brand new batteries melt."
1,"Sent battery that wouldnt charge, customer service was rude.","I left more feedback under the top negative review titled ""Customer service a joke - possible unsafe product""Subtract 2 stars because this charger will not charge batteries that are dead or have a very low charge. Batteries much first be charged with another charger and brought up to minimum level before this charger can register them (otherwise you get a NULL reading when they are inserted).Subtract 2 more points for rude customer service rep who clearly needs a lesson in manners and etiquette on treatment of customers over the phone. Got rude when I wasnt open to her suggestion that I BUY another charger (abet $1) to charge the battery (included with their $40 charger) that was giving a NULL reading."
3,Not ready for prime time,"The charger itself looks nice, is small, and light. But the AC/CD adapter is large, heavy (maybe heavier than the charger!), and the cord is much too small for my liking.Now they say that you can charge four batteries, each independant of the other. However that is not totaly accurate since you can't charge slot 2-4 faster than the battery that is in slot 1.You can't take out the two middle batteries w/o first taking out the outer two!The systems is totaly not intuitive. The manual is about worthless. And calling tech support got you to a very nice person but the people at the company aren't much familier with this product. Thye call it specialty item.I would have expected a function on the charger that will tell you hwat the battery tests at, what power. But there is none."
4,Great charger,"Love it, it is a real charger not the junk you by from the other places that just kill your rechargeables. This charger brought back a bunch of old batteries that I was going to throw away but wanted to see if a real charger could bring them back."
5,Great Charger,"I bought this based on the advise of a friend and am extremely happy with it so far. I did not find the directions at all confusing and I think some users are making it more difficult than it really needs to be.NOTE: ""Refreshing"" 2000 mAh rated batteries can take several days recharging at the slowest setting."
2,AAA performance stinks,"The AAA batteries that come with this unit have awful performance. They do not hold a charge for very long at all. I used them in my MP3 player and only received about 4 hours of play time versus 10 hours with regular alkaline AAA batteries. Also, one AAA battery failed to charge about 20 cycles and another failed after about 30 cycles."
5,Just buy it....,"I will say that the first unit was a flop, but don't let that stop you. I returned it to the manufacturer and they mailed me a new one... But this baby is a gem. I've had batteries for a long time and was having difficulty getting any use out of many of them. So, I got this because of the refresh. It works! Maybe not as good as some of the other reviews, but the good batteries pick right up, just like other have said. Then there are those dogs, but hey! They are usable for all those low consumption devices. Long and short, it is worth the bucks to save or revitalize the dead beats and to know which are you good sets and mark the dogs..."
2,Cannot charge low voltage batteries,"Charger appear to work as intended but three of the La Crosse batteries shows as 'null' and cannot be charge. This is what La Crosse customer support response:""This charger requires at least .9v in the battery in order to charge it. If the battery is depleted below that point, you will not be able to charge it on this battery charger""I can't believe their solution is for me to buy another charger to bring up the voltage, and then charge the rest using the La Crosse charger. Totally ridiculous.Additional comment: Save your money and buy the BC-700. After charging the La Crosse batteries I found it would not hold a charge. Totally useless batteries."
4,Good Little Battery Charger,"I was looking for a battery charger for my cordless mouse AAA batteries. I could never tell if the batteries were fully discharged so this charger helps me to discharge/recharge batteries. Also used for my two sets of rechargable AA batteries for my camera. While the charging was not fast (I was not in a hurry and used the slowest charges possible) it seemed to help the life of my rechargables. It is a bit difficult to use though in that you need the manual to understand and set up the options. If you like control in what a charger will do this one's for you, but if you want something simple, get a different one."
5,LaCross is Awesome - Terrific Value,"This thing totally rocks. Does everything it says it does (and more than I expected).Strangely those Chinese batteries I bought at Walmart because they said they were 2500mAh didn't make it over 2000mAh... The Lacrosse batteries all were all above 2300mAh (2460,2390,2390,2350).If I could find something to complain about it would be the C & D cell adapters. The D's are too tight fitting and they don't look like they will hold up well.It is very rare that a technology purchase exceeds my expectations. Congrats LaCross!"
4,LaCrosse Technology BC-900 AlphaPower,"Really an incredible battery charger for AA an AAA batteries, will make most sick batteries good again, a nice feature for cheapskates like me. It will also tell you how much charge is in the battery; so one knows how long it likely last. Only has two minor problems; 1 if a battery is over discharged (like left in flashlight with switch on for days), charger won't read battery and so won't charge it (easy workaround-charge with regular charger for hour or so) 2. would be nice if was redesigned to charge C, D and 9 V. batteries, it has the power. Overall the best there is for what it does."
5,Completely amazing,"I bought this to go with a couple sets of Eneloop AA batteries that I use in various camera flashes. I didn't want to damage the batteries by charging them wrong, so I bought the best charger I could find. In addition to doing a great job keeping them charged, I've been using the restore function to revitalize many of my older rechargable AAs, including a set of old 2800 mAh batteries that had been so abused that the could barely hold 800mAh. After a few days with this charger, they are back up to 2700 mAh. Amazing. I give it 5 big gold stars."
1,Couldn't get it to work,"I purchased 2 of these chargers. Tried one with the NiMh batteries that came with it but could not change the mode per the instructions. I emailed the company and they wanted to know if I used fresh Alkaline batteries!!!After many attempts and several emails I gave up and asked for a return. I returned both chargers a couple of weeks ago, delivery was confirmed, still waiting for refund."
5,Full-Featured Battery Charger,"I'm an advanced amateur photographer, and use lots of AA battery power for off-camera strobes. My rechargeable Ni-Mh batteries were getting more and more tired, delivering fewer and fewer flashes while being recharged with my generic, featureless rechargers. I had read about the LaCrosse units on [...], and decided to buy some of them. The first thing I did was to use the ""refresh"" mode on a set of batteries. After that, I noticed much longer battery life from those same batteries than I had been getting before. The LaCrosse units transformed the tired batteries into the like-new performance I expect. I highly recommend the LaCrosse chargers."
4,It is alright,"I have been using this about a month now. The most thing I like is letting you have several options to charge. What I don't like is I bought the new batteries, after using and charging few times, it says ""null"" on few of batteries (means batteries are not good for charging). After trying take out and put in, I gave up. And then the next day I put these batteries back and they are charging like nothing happened. An it happened again last night and then in the morning it was ok. I don't know what's wrong. Otherwise, I will give it a 5.Updated: 05/056/2009After 2 years of using, It just had died without warning. Lat week, when I connected it to the outlet (I unplug it when not in used), no power, nada. Tried other outlets, still death. Very disappointed."
3,You gotta throw away lots of batteries according this charger,"There are plenty of reviews out there covering all the pros, which is why I bought two of them. But there's one ANNOYING thing about this charger--Once a battery is discharged to a certain level, under normal use while still fully recoverable, it's no longer recognized by the charger. It takes a ""dumber"" charge to raise the voltage above the threshold in order to put the battery back to service. So you have to keep two chargers around."
5,One of the best battery chargers I've owned!,"Although I thought this product was pricey before I bought it, this unit has revived 3 sets (4 in each) of AA batteries, and therefore saved me having to replace them; that right there is an instant $25-30 savings. It's ability to individually charge batteries, drain and revive, and trickle charge is indispensable! The handy carrying case it comes with keeps everything nicely together when stored, and I am 100% happy with my decision to purchase the BC-900."
5,Far and away the best battery charger available!,"There is a bit of a learning curve, but the features on this beauty are wonderful, and once you own one, you'll wonder how you ever got along without it! I only wish they made one that charged 8 or 16 at a time.I love the feature that tells you precisely how many mAh have been successfully charged into the batteries! Now you can learn which brands are the best, and make accurate price/performance calculations (if you are as big a fan of efficiency as I am, anyway). Yes, I'm a technophile.Anyway, the charger is lighter than I had imagined, and it doesn't heat up the batteries like all other chargers do. It charges more slowly by default, and you can even program it to charge at the customized charge rate of your choice!It even comes with a set of decent NiMH rechargables (4xAA + 4xAAA), ""C"" & ""D"" battery adapters (use less expensive AA rechargables in devices requiring ""D or ""D"" sized batteries), and a nice nylon travel case."
2,Be sure you get the correct version. Amazon has a great return policy.,"The first charger I received was version 32 in a plastic display case. Compartment three did not work and the mode, display, and current buttons would not respond. I e-mailed LaCross and they wanted me to send the defective one back before they would send me a new one. On the other hand, Amazon was terrific. They sent me a new one immediately and I had 30 days to return, prepaid, the old charger. The second version came in a cardboard box. It was version 33 and it works perfectly. The version number shows immediately when you connect the charger to an electic outlet."
1,Auto Shut Off?,"I did a lot of research and chose this juicer based on reputation, motor power and style. I exchanged the first one and am now going to have to exchange/return the second one because it automatically turns off after about 90 seconds, even if nothing is being juiced and the motor just runs! It is not the electricity as I have used several more powerful appliances in the same outlet."
1,Warning: this juicer is a weapon,"I loved this juicer the first couple of times i used it, it was much much better than my juiceman junior in every possible way (easy to clean, decent noise level, dry pulp, etc) until i had a very unpleasant surprise. As some other people said, the juicer started vibrating and the lid became loose, the noise it made almost gave me an heart attack. Even after turning the juicer off, it took a few minutes for the motor to stop so it kept making that scary noise. I even left the room, i was afraid that the blade could somehow detach itself and hit me.Had it not been for this design flaw, i'd have given it 4 or 5 star. If you wanna buy it for yourself, go ahead, you've been warned but please, do not ever let anyone else use it or worse, don't give it to someone as a gift. I think it should be taken off the market, it's too dangerous."
4,"Good product, but a little more info would be helpful","After 20 years with another juicer, a different brand (which I used only sporadically, because it really was a pain to clean), I splurged with this one. I have only used it a few times and was impresed with the (carrot)juice it produced and how easy it was to clean. However, my gripe is that the manufacturer does not provide enough written info. I couldn't even find anything about what wattage the motor was let alone any specific info on how to prepare fruit/vegs for the machine (e.g., do I have to take the tops off the carrots, peel the apples, remove pits from watermelon? etc). One reviewer states a problem he/she had with watermelon; perhaps if there was info on how to juice different fruits/vegs, this person would not have had to replace the same part three times. A small appliance this costly should give the consumer some basic info as to how best use it."
2,Works well on carrots ... but not much else.,"This was the first juicer I purchased and I'm hoping that they're not all like this one. They enclose an advisory telling you to ""use a forceful motion for hard, firm vegetables"" and a ""slow light motion"" when juicing ""soft vegetables and fruits"". I followed this advice and tried the unit four times before giving up. And on the last attempt I only juiced carrots. It would invariably begin to vibrate soon after I began juicing. The most I managed was six carrots before it began to vibrate, which is caused when the basket no longer spins level due to uneven pulp distribution. When this happens the blade begins to grind at the base of the feeder chute. I returned mine."
1,A terrible video!,This a poor quality video shot by one camera in what looks like a basement. Actors look away during thier lines as if they don't want anyone to see what they are doing. This is not for small children and older kids and adults will find it boring. Don't waste your money.
4,glossary anyone?,This book would have greatly benifited from the inclusion of a glossary. Any work covering a subject this complex needs definitions set out and collected together. The publisher's given web site was unavailable.
2,Not working as well as I'd like,"I like this style of headphone radio (especially when I jog), and haven't found any similar models that I like. This is my third purchase of this radio. Each of the three have had problems. First died completely (although it was used a lot). Second still works, but last number doesn't show up on digital display. I wanted a backup in case second died, so I ordered another one. This third works least well of all. At times, entire display is off, radio doesn't work at all, or it won't change channels. Then other times it worked. Seems like might be affected by heat outside. However, I know have another persistent problem. That being, it won't let me program the preset stations. Again, I'm limited in my choices, and I use this type headphone a lot. So I suffer through poor quality."
1,Bosch Fuel Pump,"the Pump was new and priced very low, but it was the WRONG PUMP. Had already tried to place it in the tank, so return was out of the question."
5,Great Single!,"This is the first single from Dave's solo album and my favorite track (but not the only excellent one) from the album. As far as singles go this one is very good. I grew up loving the remixes on the late 80s and early 90s CD singles and find most recent CD single remixes lacking. This is not the case here there is a good mix of remixes and sounds to keep both modern fans and fans of earlier ages very happy. Not to mention the bonus tracks which are good enough to have been included on the album. I guess they had to save some of the good stuff for the CD singles too. I would highly recommend buying this if you are a Depeche Mode or Dave Gahan fan, if you like his album or even just like the song."
4,Good D Single,"The Single is good, but there are better remixes and additional songs of his solo work, and in Depeche Mode"
5,Great Little Meter,VERY satisfied with the performance of this meter. Have been looking for a Relative Humidity meter for some time that was accurate and durable. The temperature is also included which is great. Price is VERY good for what you get !!!
2,Big Digital Display That Is Easy to See - But Didn't Last,"The weather meter shows temperature and moisture level in a room. It has a large digital display that I can see across the room. I don't know about the temperature; but the moisture level number ""seems"" to kind-of match what is shown in my humidifier.The bottom line is that it is cheap and good, and I bought two of them -- one in each floor.UPDATE ON 08/22/2012:Sadly after one year, both units died. Therefore, I will have to give it a low rating."
2,Not working properly,I bought this over a different product because I liked the smiley face/frowny face options & they don't even work. The frowning face is on there all the time regardless of the weather. It's kind of depressing. Also I think it's off by about 1 degree in general.
1,Waste of time,"This product malfunctioned from the get go. I was unable to get it working.For that price, it's a shame. You can purchase one of those multifuntionclock thermometer for less than $5.I would give this product 0 star."
1,Batteries beware,"Well, it works pretty well... until you have to replace the batteries. I accidentally put mine in backwards (a pretty common occurance, I think) and I smelled a slight burning odor coming from what I assume was a circuit board inside the unit. Bottom line: The thing completely fryed when you put the batteries in backwards, nufff said."
4,Works fine,"Pros:Unit seems to be sturdy enough and the numerals are easy to read.Responds quickly to changes (i.e. taking it outside).Cons:None.You have to press the max/min button really hard to cause it to work, but I never use it anyway.I would recommend this to a friend who wanted a inexpensive hygrometer/thermometer."
4,It gets the job done...,"Alright I would like to start off by saying that the locking mechanism is fantastic, the same idea behind all the U-Locks, so they don't really get credit for something new and inventive, just being able to do something properly. That cool looking black and silver cover over the actual lock however could be made with more durable plastic... I dropped the damn thing once from the height of a normal 19"" cross tube and the plastic shattered... Lock still functions perfectly fine, but I was annoyed that it didn't look so pretty anymore."
5,Great Alarm clock/cd player,"This clock radio saves a whole lot of space that includes a built-in CD player to your nightstand, or anywhere else you're limited for space. The AM/FM stereo tuner has great reception, and the multi-setting dial makes time and alarm setup a breeze. You also get an extendable snooze timer. The backlit LCD display makes it easy to see what time it is, and brightness control lets you dial in the perfect contrast making it easier to sleep. 5 station presets are great, or you can drop in your a CD for a listen. The best part of it is you can wake to CD! Dual alarm makes life simpler for couples i guess, and the memory backup is great for when there are power outage overnight."
1,Less than 3 months,"My partner uses a portable cassette player to listen to books on tape. I have always bought Sony Walkmans and have been very happy with them. I bought the FX281 unit on March 30, 2002, and it's dead already. The tapes don't play and the buttons don't work. I guess if you only pay $[money]you can't expect it to last forever. I'm very disappointed as I type this on my Sony computer - I am a big Sony fan, but my partner doesn't want another Sony Walkman."
4,I DON'T TRUST IT !!!!!!!!!!,"Like i said...I DON'T TRUST IT !!!! Not that I think someone can break it open. I don't trust that I can get it open. After using it for about 2 weeks, it got a bit tricky to open. But I stuck with it, because it wasn't that difficult. But after 6 weeks, I sometimes have a heck of a time getting the darn thing unlocked. I have another ONGUARD lock with a combination lock that I have had for over 3 years...and NO PROBLEMS. But I needed a longer U-LOCK. It's too late to return this item, but I'm gonna buy a new lock. I'm scared to death I won't be able to unlock it some day. Too bad, because I love the size and measurements of this lock.UPDATE...Gonna raise to 4 stars. I've learned that you have to keep the key turned all the way while unlocking. Since I like the size of the lock, I'll look beyond the ""key thing"", and raise to 4 stars."
4,the fifth star died with Zandramas or maybe 10 pages later.,"it was a bit sad to read the book knowing its the last bonbon, i bellive Eddings felt the same when he wrote the last 50 pages."
2,A promice unfulfilled,"I too could not wait for this climax. So much buildup for this final conflict to decide the fate of the universe, and it fizzled. I know my expectations were unreasonable but they were set by Mr. Eddings and the let down was no fun. I wish I hadn't started the series."
5,Dido and Aeneus Personal Review,"This Cd was magnificent. Purcell's composing was directed well and had all the right components to accompany the singing. I have just been exposed to an Opera piece I am pleased with. I was exposed from a friend who took a Music Appreciation class. The singing was calm and soothing unlike other operas which are loud and proclaiming. I immediately fell in love with Dido and Aeneus. For any opera enthusiasts, I would highly recommend this CD."
3,not what was promised,i ordered the hot wheels 10 car pack for my niece . the delivery was right on time and gift wrapped corectly . but when she opened the box for christmas the hot wheels 10 car variety pack only has 9 cars in it .Hot Wheels 10 Car Pack (Styles May Vary)so at this point i feel my niece did not get what she was promised .
3,Seeing life stages through John Updike,Self-ConsciousnessThis book of John Updike's memoirs is a revealing view of how he viewed his life as he passed through various stages. The overly detailed descriptions of specific streets and houses led me to boredom frequently and seemed to have way too much space for the stories needs. His introverted image of himself is inconsistent with how his peers viewed him. The class rapscallion is missing of Shillington High School 1950 is missing.Memorable book that follows the personal life of this great author through many stages of his life.
3,"Well, that explains a lot.","Following an able and readable survey of color science (such as it is), the author concludes that, since color doesn't fit anywhere in our science (as presently conceived), it therefore follows that color doesn't exist -- or is, at best, an illusion. Brilliant! Just think of all the troublesome phenomena that might be dismissed in this manner."
3,Limbus 4 'Mandalas' (Ohr),"Originally released in 1970, this looks to be the German band's second of just two albums. Best described as 'free form jazz / krautrock'. This CD didn't exactly blow my mind, but I thought it was okay. The four tracks within are ""Dhyana""(10:08), ""Kundalini""(5:48), ""Heiku""(2:17) and what I considered to be the disc's best cut, the lengthy ""Plamsa""(19:28). This digipack listed the four musicians, Odysseus Artner, Mathias Knieper, Bernd Henninger and Gerd Kraus but they don't list WHICH instruments each one plays. They, do however list various instruments used to make this lp were bass,piano,violin,various flutes,percussion,tablas,etc. THOUGHT I heard a kazoo on this CD. Just might somewhat appeal to fans of Floh De Cologne,Anima and Hoelderlin."
4,What can I say about this anime?,"I must admit that the first time I saw a chapter of these series, I liked it so much that I just wanted to see it all. Geneshaft has its own original plot, the characters have a reason to behave the way they do (wich is explained during the series) and one gets involved with them without even knowing.Its a shame that there isnt too much info about this anime in the net, but that doesnt mean its a poor anime. I will definitely give it a thumb-up."
5,More than Motivation--a Guide for How-To-Succeed,"Lou Holtz boils his life's wisdom down to ten teachable steps:1. Power of Attitude2. Tackle Adversity3. Have a Sense of Purpose4. Make Sacrifice Your Ally5. Adapt or Die6. Chase Your Dreams7. Nurture Your Self-Image8. Foster Trust with Others9. Commit to Excellence10. Handle Others with CareEach of these steps become a chapter of his book, which he illustrates by lessons from life and the gridiron. Holtz's language is conversational, even parental. This tone, however, also underlies a steely determination and intensity. I try to read this book at least once per year, and it is for me the single most beneficial self-help book I have ever read."
2,eye cream,"I used it until it was gone. Was moisturizing but overall I did not notice any difference. It is expensive cream, so to me not worth the purchase after I noticed no difference."
2,Didn't work,This product did not work for me and if you have really sensitive eye areas be careful. I'm glad I didn't pay the $75 like it shows on other websites.
4,Simple and Powerfull,"This is the ideal blender. Nobody really needs 10,000 speeds. all you need is high and low. This is easy to use and powerful enough to do anything with. I use mine mostly for frozen drinks, so I really wear the blades out, and they're pretty worn now. I assume they can be sharpened, but I wish they had stayed sharp a bit longer, or that it came with replacement blades.I will admit I did something stupid once and was pushing some ice down with a metal object the the inevitable happened...it made contact with the blades. to my amazement, the metal object bent, and the blade was not at all damaged...so it's strong!As long as you maintain this by sharpening the blade, this is the only blender you'll even need."
1,TERRIBLE!,This blender DID NOT work on a measly smoothie. The design of the carafe may be the problem. Blenders with a funnel-shaped carafe work best because the motor creates a tornado-like suction that moves everything to the center and down. This Waring blender has a straigt-sided carafe. I had to use a spoon EVERY time to get a smooth result... and ice? Forget it! I sent mine back and ended up getting a Black and Decker $39 one from Target and LOOOOVE it!
1,Returned same day.,"I purchased this blender today after having my eye on it at the store for a long time. (After Christmas sale.) I got it home and after ten minutes of attempting to thread the cheap, malleable base (the part that fits down onto the motor) onto the glass container, I gave up, stuffed it back in the box and returned it. I thought I'd see if it was just a lemon, but I could not remove the base on the display model. Either it was glued on, or once on, it's difficult to remove. I didn't bother to read the reviews here, but I've given the stainless base and glass container, I was not expecting such a cheap base. Truly, what's wrong with appliance makers? Do they really think that designed obsolesce means we're going to buy a new product of theirs when the old one fails after six months to a year? Or won't even work out of the box?"
2,Doesn't cut it,I bought this blender for one purpose - to make smoothies. And the directions even give instructions for smoothies and frozen bar drinks. So I was very disappointed when I couldn't even get this blender to crush ice. I poured my first smoothy and it had huge chunks of ice in it. I would not recommend this blender.
1,Worthless Chunk of Metal,"ONE MONTH, is all it took for this blender to breakdown. If it can't blend a smoothie then it should say so on the BOX!!! Professional, yeah right! My parents have a 14 dollar blender that has lasted 15 years and 4 kids. Do not buy this one unless you enjoy returning items."
1,not like the old days....,"This brand used to be one to get. This model is total garbage !It leaks on the top, its made very cheaply on the bottom of the pitcher.The part that engages into the drive is the worst design I have ever seen for a blender. After a week it started to make really bad sounds while running.I cannot wash out the smell that is in the pitcher, I do not understand why. I think the plastic bottom has trapped the smell.All we use it for is making baby formula."
1,It looks great but it won't last!,"My husband and I received this blender as a wedding gift. After only a few weeks, it stopped working completely, so we exchanged it for a new one. We've had the second blender for less than a year now and lately we've noticed the same ""burning motor"" smell that preceded the breakdown of the first one. I don't expect this blender to last for much longer."
5,Inspires the imagination,"The story tells only what is necessary to make the point and get the reader to where they should be going with out boring descriptions of unneeded things. The author doesn't over do details of landscapes and cities and characters, and leaves enough for the reader's imagination. I highly recommend it."
1,Awful,"I read the Da Vinci Code, which in my opinion was a work of art.After I read that, I was hungry for more. So I got this. But this is atrocious. It is worse than anything Iv'e read in a long time. It lacks the thrilling sensation that the Da Vinci Code gave me, it was just too mainstream for my tastes. Also, I could do without all the violence. This book is simply awful. It is not worth anyone's time or money. Read the Da Vinci Code, but stay far away from this atrocity."
3,Smart people don't act this way,I enjoyed the story and as usual Dan Brown's books are easy and fun to read but the whole time I was thinking that Susan Fletcher was no super genius because she acted like a dumb blonde.
4,read it in a day,"I picked it up in the morning and finished it late that afternoon. It kept my attention non-stopped. It was a fast paced thriller which thoroughly entertained. Those seeking profound litterature, stay away. It's simply meant to amuse. I love the way it switched constantly from seen to seen. It helped keep my attention. There was always a new twist. You feel like you just got off a roller coaster in the end."
4,"Subtitle, ""A Thriller,"" says it all","I'm more of a mystery-novel reader rather than a spy-novel reader, but I was captured by this intriguing tale, ""ripped from the headlines,"" if you will. Author Dan Brown's account of what might happen if a secret government agency becomes too eager to keep encryption software out of the hands of the masses resonates eerily with what's going on in Congress and at the Pentagon today.If you like a novel with lots of plot twists, this is your book. I must admit that I found the story rather overplotted and often too reliant on coincidence. My main problem with the book was that it lacked a sense of person and place -- there was very little characterization, and the settings never hit home for me.Still, I didn't put it down until I finished it, and that's a mark of a good read, kvetches aside. I look forward to Brown's next one."
5,EXCELLENT,I wasnt familiar with this book until a friend suggested I read it after I had already read other Dan Brown books. I can say that it is adequate so far and meets my expectations but Im not overly impressed since I contrast the davinci code and angels and demons to this book. The latter are much more intellectually stimulating if that is what you are looking for.
2,A Thriller for Homer Simpson,"If you haven't guessed the twists, intrigue and punchline in the first 50 pages you need to get out more. Seriously, this is a book you throw in the corner after you finish and look for a way to make up for lost time.2 stars for the effort to create a Clancy-ish thriller, lots of effort. Unfortunately, you could toss out half the book and loose little of any meaningful story line or entertainment.The subject matter, (NSA, Crypto, Mega Computers), is interesting enough and has a few geeky delights. However, it seems like a short story / eZine article blown into a book by adding pure filler = and as a result it's a yawner.Not worth the money."
3,What year is it?,"The era of this book has me confused. On page 114 David uses pesetas in Spain. Spain has been on the Euro using the real currency since Jan 1, 2002. Was this book written back in time? Just a question........."
1,"A parody, I hope","This book combines a mediocre thriller, an average mystery, a delusional romance and a terrible computer security assessment all in one barely readable, bloated package. I'm glad Dan Brown is now fat and wealthy from ""the Da Vinci code,"" because clearly he needs a different job than ""writer."" There are numerous technical errors in the book, poor descriptions of computer security and coding, and other illusions that I might expect from a TV afterschool special but not from a bestselling author. Brown should pay attention to Crichton and Gibson before doing this again. I would not recommend this book to anyone (unless they had a paperless outhouse)."
4,"Excellent, Fast-paced read","If you like Dan Brown's quick style, you will love this book. It is very suspenseful, and quick paced. It would make a great movie."
5,"Gripping, realistic,intriguing thriller","I saw Dan Brown at Exeter, and got to meet him after the speech. His book was inspired by a student arrested at Exeter after sending E-Mail to his friend about how much he hated Clinton. The government intercepted the E-Mail, and inspired the author to come up with the idea for a story about the NSA. Good Read!"
2,Disappointing read,"I agree with the reviewer who said this book reads like a screenplay. A rather chaotic screenplay I may add. It is fast-paced, yes (there are 128 chapters, i.e. approximately that number of scene changes), but it is hardly a thriller. The parts of the plot that are not predictable are simply because they are too incredulous and unbelievable to be predicted. The worst is the ending. After more than a hundred chapters you find out you've just been led on a wild-goose chase, the ""code"" the characters have been seeking stares at you in print but the characters only realize it 10 pages later, and the epilogue, the epilogue... I suggest they take it out in future prints because it serves no purpose except to frustrate the reader further with its ludicrousness."
2,weak,"Since I couldn't get my hands on the much-talked DaVinci Code, I thought I would try his other books.Digital Fortress is an easy read, but at best it's a weak Michael Crichton. Its plot twists were simply lame, and all the ""miraculous"" turns to save David Becker's life was just too unbelievable and too convenient.I will still give DaVinci Code a try as people say he gets better, I hope so because Digital Fortress was simply weak."
3,"Good, but not a favorite","This story is interesting and fun to read, especially to figure out the puzzle at the end, it just isn't Dan Brown at his best. Don't judge nor end enjoying this authors work with this book. Do read his other works, especially Angels and Demons and DaVinci Code. They are 5 star pieces of work."
2,Decent but not good,"I loved Angels and Demons and I loved the Da Vinci Code but this book was not on the same level. Don't get me wrong, it is a good book and a fast read but there were several things that decreased the overall enjoyment of this book. For one the action seemed forced and the book was fairly predictable, also the book describes the NSA as being a mega powerful, top secret agency with far reaching powers but during the course of the book it seems as though this agency wasn't powerful nor even intelligent. In fact we only see three agents for most of the book. If you need to pass time on a flight or read a book while waiting for your doctors appointment, get this. If your expecting to be entertained and learn as well as enjoy yourself, get Angels and Demons."
1,Has Dan Brown ever been in Spain?,"After reading the book, it's clear Dan Brown has never been in Spain. I hope (and I am sure) many Americans who have gone there know almost all references about Spain are false.I cannot understand why an author like Dan Brown can write a book without knowing what he is writing. Simply unbelievable.The plot is quite unrealistic and complex. I got bored after page 150. The same happened to me with ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""Angels & Deamons""."
1,A poor novel,"I read DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons, and loved them both. This book fell FAR short. The plot twists are very clumsy and obvious. The plot revolves around cryptography and the internet. Brown made two flaws (well, the same flaw with two facets) he included too much detail in the methods that the technology in his plot used. For people who are technical, and understand how cryptography actually works, the book is painful to read, because he has major fundamental flaws with the way that crypto works. Suspension of disbelief is totally trashed. For people who aren't technical, the details he includes add no value, and are too confusing to understand. If he had been more vague, both groups would have been better off.For a book that deals with the subject of crypto intelligently, go with Cryptonomicon, by Niel Stephenson."
2,"Silly nonsense, but at least its fast-paced silly nonsense","With The Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown easily joined the leagues of the best-selling titans. Digital Fortress, his first novel, is another pot-boiler, crowd-pleasing thrilla many will scoff at but few will put down due to boredom. Come on, a lot of the chapters are only a few paragraphs long. Brown was really aiming for the ultra ADD crowd with this ""novel"", and at times, the prose makes Crichton seem like Hemingway. Still, if you're a sucker for this sort beachbag reading, you'll probably enjoy Digital Fortress.Yours without wax. . ."
1,Quite possibly the worst book I have ever read........,"I really enjoyed DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons however as the title states, this book is horrible. I don't need to restate what others have shared already - just do yourself a favor and move along, nothing to see here...."
5,Great new writer.,"I should preface this review by saying that reading Digital Fortress was a departure from my usual fare of gumshoe mysteries. A friend recommended it very highly, and so I took the plunge not knowing what to expect. I must say, I was enormously rewarded. Digital Fortress is one of the most exciting and entertaining books I have ever read (I am an avid reader and do not say this lightly.) This novel has it all.... pace, smarts, intrigue, and plenty of exceptionally entertaining characters. The locales are beautiful and secretive, while the action is tight and relentlessly spun (the chase through Seville Spain is my favorite.) There are a number of unexpected twists in Digital Fortress that kept me flipping pages well into the night. I wish more writers took the time to plot books this ingeniously. I anxiously await Mr. Brown's next novel."
1,Do some JAPANESE research,"I tried to read this book while I was visiting my Japanese in-laws in Japan. I was extremely annoyed with Brown's lack of research in Japanese. His character names do not even exist in Japanese. It is like naming an American character, ""xyllsjdfd"" Futhermore, the little Japanese phrases he used in Japanese were completely non-sensical. I think he just made up the words. The one word that does exist, he used COMPLETELY the wrong way. He said that the 7 Gods ""shichigosan"" were on his side. ""Shichigosan"" means 7, 5, 3. It is a day where children ages 7, 5, and 3 dress up in kimono!!!I couldn't even finish reading the book. He lacks credibility. And from what I've read on this site, he also did not do his research about Spain."
2,A very weak book,This is indeed a very weak book. Dan Brown is just selling on the shadow of the Da Vinci Code. Certain authors exhaust themselves very quickly.
1,Astoundingly bad,"Brown is attempting to do for computers and the NSA what Tom Clancy does for the military and their hardware. The difference is that Clancy appears to do his homework, whereas Brown manages to have errors on almost every page and appears to have put no effort at all into learning how either computers or encryption work. Anyone who has a reasonably technical background in computing will wince on reading this claptrap. This habit continues into his description of Spain, where much of the action is set (hey Dan, they're a modern European country, not a banana republic!) and pretty much everything else that he touches."
1,"Wow, was this bad.","I read Angels and Demons first. Then I read The Da Vinci Code. Both were good. Not because they were well written, but because they had interesting story lines. But, both of those books were predictable. But the WORST book he has written so far is Digital Fortress. I knew the ""who-dunnit"" in the first quarter of the book and read the rest in case I was wrong. I wasn't. Unfortunatly, Mr. Brown only gave you one character that knew all the details. And that character was, of course, the guilty party. I was actually mad by the time I finished the book.Another little issue I don't like are the clumsy suspense attempts. I hate knowing I am not given information to make me read more pages. If it's seamless, it's great. When it's not (and it's not), it stinks.Beware. Da Vinci Code is good, but this book is not even worth the six dollars."
1,Load of rubbish - diabolical research - inaccurate,"No where near as enjoyable a read as the Da Vinci code and really annoying because he talks about places in Spain, Sevilla as if it was 40 years ago. The way he describes Sevilla as a backward type of place shows the poor or non existant research he did regards the places depicted in the book.I was reading about totally modern problems of cryptology and about up to date computer hardware and it really grated when he spoke of Seveilla as if it was in a third world country. Either he did one of those ""Europe in 5 days tours"" that the the Americans seem to love or he looked in an out of date book for information.Frankly I was appalled by this unprofessional approach of a bestselling author.I hope he did a better job of Rome in the other book of his..."
3,Fun,"Like Da vinci Code, a clever book but not a pretty one.The writing is crisp, the plot moves along briskly and the ending is quite seismic. However, there are too many coincidences to be credible and the characterisation is very weak. One feels no empathy for the players and its difficult to really get involved in events.A fun read nevertheless."
3,Continuing with quality work,"Dan Brown is continuing to impress me. I have read both Angels and Demons (3 stars) and The Da Vinci Code (5 stars). I would continue to recommend this book to people who are fond of his writing style.I believe the book had some technical imperfections. I am kind of a technical guy, so I found somethings to be laughable, but nothing was so grotesque in mistatement that is ruined the book for me. More technical people may just find it laughable and be more hung up on those details than I was. In any case, the book is ultimately a good love story with some predictable highlights throughout the last 1/3 of the book.I was again (as in Angels and Demons) a bit disappointed by the ending. Perhaps it was the somewhat predictive nature or perhaps it was the lack of a clear ""moment of truth"" that was not as predictably concluded.Overall, good but still not up to his best."
2,"Good openning stage, bad climatic ending.","I am starting to doubt the reviews I read online now. I bought the book because of the reviews. Anyways, the book had good first half. Here the author did ok job introducing the plot and the characters, but after everything else fell like to crumbles.I agree with the other reviewer, who said that the characters were so unreal. I mean lets face it, if stuff that happens on the book did actually happen nobody would be skeptical about the problems. Even a false alarm in an org. like NSA, they check it. I wanted to stop reading, but like the habit I have to finish what I started I had to read to end. Then the end was something to make you wanna throw the book in the fireplace (hey at least is useful for this winter) or sell it back.Anyways, don't take my review into account. Make your own judgement, but before go to your store and flip to the pages b4 buying."
1,Too many coincidences.,"I agree with the other reviewers who gave this a well-deserved 1 star based on factual errors, etc. But the worst part is the plot - it stumbles and bumps along, powered by coincidence after coincidence to get the character of the moment out of whatever trouble he or she is in at the moment. The only cheap plot trick Brown didn't use was to have a character wake up and realize that the problem was ""only a dream"". This is a book deserving of being tossed out of the open window of a speeding train."
2,Canned techno-thriller,"I found this on my plane seat and plowed through the first 50 pages. The writing style reminds me of the dreck I cranked out for my high school creative writing assignments minutes before it was due. The crypto is wrong. If the NSA's computer could break a code in 10 minutes, wouldn't extending the key by 8 bits cause it to take 42 hours? And it wouldn't work on triple DES. If you know nothing about crypto, then you can hold your nose and waste a few hours of your life reading this book."
2,Who are the good guys?,"***Warning: Plot spoilers ahead!***How does one write a novel about something that ends up being non-existent by the end of the book? Welcome to ""Digital Fortress.""Dan Brown, best-selling author of ""The Da Vinci Code,"" pens an adequate practice run with ""Digital Fortress""...but only adequate. It spins a ""what if"" scenario about a government agency that wants badly to have access to all digital communications globally in order to ""serve and protect."" This big brother plot is interesting enough to hook the reader, but once inside the story, there are no characters with whom to sympathize. Who are the bad guys and who are the good guys? By the end of the novel I still had no clear idea of who the author was wanting me to like and who to hate, and that apathy made me ask why I'd bothered to read to the finish? Perhaps that's why ""Digital Fortress"" didn't put the author on the map, but will become a sort of ""backhanded"" bestseller based on ""The Da Vinci Code."""
1,A waste of an afternoon,"This Dan Brown ""classic"" starts off slowly and never picks up any steam. About 60 dull pages in, I finally started skimming through the balance of the story just to see how it ends. It ends predictably, I might add.The Da Vinci Code this is not: Don't bother."
1,Digital Fortress,"This book was a terrible disappointment. I have read this other three books and this was the dullest. No real excitement until the last 30 pages - at most. The Da Vinci Code, Agnles and Deamons and, to some degree, had plot twists, tension and excitement, along with characters you could relate to. No so in this book. Save your money."
4,Good book,"I really enjoyed it, it is not quite at the level of Angels and Demons or DaVinci Code, but still a good read. I am fairly computer literate, perhaps a true techie might find fault with some of the plot points, but I didn't. I don't understand how someone could give it only 1 star. If you want ""literature"", fine, go read Dickens or something, but this is a great vacation book that I would highly recommend."
2,Typical Dan Brown,"Having read first ""Angels and Deamons"" and ""The Davinci Code"", I found ""Digital Fotress"" somewhat boring. The plot is very predictable, especially when it comes to the major characters. Just like the other two books, the main characters are a college professor and a beautiful and dynamic woman who is an expert in what she does (in this case being a cryptographer).Possibly, the author tries to live his unfulfilled dreams and expectations through his writings. However it is not a bad read by the beach."
2,Digital Fortress,"I'll give Dan a break on this book by giving him two stars. The book is very fast paced, but while it is fast to read it lacks technical accuracy. Much of the encryption technology discussed in the book is just plain wrong. In addition, the book compares some encryption technology with compression technology, which didn't make any sense to me at all. Over all, the initial concept of this book which states there is an unbreakable encryption technology is true and in use today."
2,It's getting harder and harder for me to finish a Dan Brown book,"I started off with the Da Vinci Code, then Angels & Demons, then Deception Point, and now I'm finally at Digital Fortress. Each book seemed to be more ridiculous and unpolished than the last.Honestly, I really enjoyed the Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, even if they are filled with inaccuracies and artistic liberties. Digital Fortress though, seems so corny and contrived that I'm having a hard time reading it.The main character is a beautiful, intelligent, perfect woman who works as a top code breaker for the NSA. She reminds me of those characters in Bollywood films who work for high-profile fashion design firms. She's in a perfect relationship that has some troubles when they each get caught up in their perfect jobs. Of course, I assume that these troubles will be perfectly resolved by the end of the book, if I ever finish it, that is. Maybe I'll just move on to another book."
3,An Average Thriller,"This book has nothing to do with ""The Da Vinci Code"". Moreover, it is full of inaccuracies (for example, Dan Brown states that the Nagasaki bomb did not use plutonium as its fissionable matter) and is more worthy of a beginner author. If you really want to read some good tech-spy-thrillers go to the pros, such as Tom Clancy and Robert Ludlum.The reason I did give it three stars and not less is that it did help me pass many hours waiting in the airport for my flight. That is, the book as a thriller is basically good. However, if you're expecting something like ""The Da Vinci Code"" or just a good, accurate, realistic, researched thriller, don't waste your time with this book."
3,Not nearly as good as DaVinci Code,"After reading (and being delighted with) The DaVinci Code, I picked this one up. I was slightly disappointed with it. The characters were not that well-developed, the plot was slightly unbelivable, and the ending was completely ridiculous. If you're looking for an entertaining read that isn't very deep I'd recommend this. It's written okay but with very little research. However, if you are looking for the mental stimulation and excitement of the DaVinci code skip this one."
4,Digital Fortress by: Dan Brown,It's a decent book. There's a lot of computer terms in there that I'm not used to. I like Dan Brown's style of writing but this isn't his best book.
3,Digital Fortress,"HELP! I am trying to figure out the code at the very end! I know you need to use the book, if anyone could give a hint, even just a way to get me started! I have had sleepless nights trying to figure it out!"
2,Sill Little Computer Story,"This book was full of plot twists and turns and was also a fast read. But upon finishing it, it seemed more to me like a silly, little computer story. I knew I was reading a fictional story, but it was a little far-fetched. I also agree with another reviewer that it read more like a screenplay than a book. But the story was entertaining and made my travels go by quicker. So if you are looking for some light, entertaining reading that goes by quick, this would be a great book. It is also a good book to start with before reading any of Dan Brown's other books as he definitely has his own writing style!"
1,Sodhappal,"The beginning of the story was good. As it went onwards it picked p momentum. Later on, it dropped behind.I was able to predict even before I reached one quarter, that The Commander was the crook.Similarities.....similarities....similarities.Decoding - common to Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons, and Digital Fortress.Same type of second villains - Assassin in DVC; Hutolot in Digital Fortress.Arch Villains - The Commander in DF; Sir something something in DVC; the Popes personal secretary in A&D.;Digital Fortress - after half-way, it is 'sodhappal'.Know what a 'sodhappal' is?Maybe Dan Brown will have to try his hand at decding this one."
1,"""God-Awful""","If ""God-awful"" is one word instead of two, then I can summarize this book in a single word."
3,Willing Suspension of Disbelief Required,"Entertaining ride, but the events in this book require a complete suspension of any knowledge you might have of computers, viruses, encryption, etc. If you don't know anything about those fields, and you like his other books, you'll like this one, too - but treat it as fiction. If you do know anything about those fields, check your knowledge at the door."
3,Quick Read,"Maybe I have really low expectations of Mass-Market Paperback Adventures. I didn't expect a stellar piece of work or anything comparable to Angels and Demon's or the Da Vinci Code. Yet this book still offered a mind-numbing, quick adventure to pass the time. I doubt that I will ever read this book again but it was interesting while it lasted. The storyline wasn't all that developed and unfortunately the author chose to go overboard on plot twists rather then develop his characters at length. If you are looking for something to read to pass the time this book is great. If you are looking for something more intellectually stimulating you might want to pass on this book."
2,So so plot,"When i first read Da Vinci Code, i felt Dan Brown has it in him to write good stories...in fact, this books is equally thrilling...however, there are a lot of loop holes and at one point i was really frustrated by the ability of a 172 IQ susan Fletcher...Cant believe that someone with that high IQ couldnt guess ""elements"" refered to chemistry, and that Tenkado pointing his 3 fingers meant difference in 238-235!Couldnt believe that a person with that IQ needs that much of explaning from deputy director before she understands the plots....poorly written...possibly for a reader with IQ of 70?"
1,HIST KOBO KUSSC,"If you deciphered the title of this post, you've just used more brain power than required by this ""novel""After reading DVC and visiting Dan's site, I was hoping for another fun read sprinkled with interesting facts and revelations. What a great topic - the ambiguous morality of an all seeing protector, high tech intrigue, inner secrets of the NSA, etc. - too bad it was so uninteresting, not to mention sophomoric. He barely touches on the complex issues involved in the safety vs security debate. The characters are two dimentional and the dialogue is about as sophisticated as that written by a high school freshman. I finished the damn thing, always hoping the cool part was around the corner. Nada. Who didn't figure out that the difference between uranium 238 and uranium 235 is 8 about four pages before the geniuses of the NSA?"
1,A cliff hanger every five pages,"If you enjoyed this you might also like ""Secret of Skull Mountain"" by Frank Dixon."
1,laughable computer science / cryptography,"having read the da vinci code and being impressed by the apparent amount of background details, the digital fortress completely shattered my belief in dan brown's assiduousness in doing background research. the inaccuracies/misconceptions in what the NSA does, in computer engineering, algorithms, cryptography, etc turned me off; the characters as caricatures of professors and researchers was the best anti-cialis i've come across in a while."
4,Digital fortress is very cool!,"This book is very good. It put the reader in the cryptography world where exists a lot of technologies. The author added in the history, several cryptography technologies that are used to protect confidential informations. In parallel to this, occurs a tram of love and power."
3,Could have been better...,"This book would have been much better had Dan Brown omitted about 50 pages. The plot drags on and on, with the slow-moving storyline never going anywhere. Read other Dan Brown novels, don't waste your time or money here."
3,Good music...,Very good music from the old times but awful recording. Level of sound increases or decreases from one song to the other.If you are not picky about audio details go for it.
4,"Watch out, James Bond","Great spy/adventure flick. Bette Davis makes an great villainess. If I didn't know it was Bette Davis ahead of time, I never would have guessed it was her. Great inventions/gadgets on par with anything created for Bond. And the best part? The 'good guys' lose."
1,"Just like the people on Candid Camera, DON'T be fooled!!!",There are a lot of repeating segments in this set. Don't be fooled by the good reviews. This series is put together in a poor manner. I never bought something where the same material is shown several times.
1,NOT WORTH A DOLLAR,"I had read other reviews about this company's products and for the most part they were mostly negative, but this item had no reviews so I thought it would be better than the other products I read about; boy was I wrong. I got on the scale and it said that I was about five pounds lighter than I was when I was weighed by a professional scale only a few days earlier. So I got on it again and this time it displayed a compeltely different number. This is the worst thing I have ever gotten from amazon and I strongly recommend that know one waste their money!!!! This product gave me nothing but a headache."
1,Totally defective,"I thought that the previous review about the scale was wrong, that possibly the person weighing themselves was not doing it right etc. But this scale is totally screwy!! It has this molded plastic curvy edge that doesn't allow a normal size foot (I'm a 7 1/2) to rest comfortably, so you are practically teetering on the scale, and then when you manage to get some balance it gives you a wrong reading. Weird, just bad design, bad electronics, and a waste of money and time. I'm getting a refund."
3,Beach Boys,Just an OK collection; couldn't find the CD I lost. Has a bunch of songs I've never heard and don't want to hear again. These guys were great when they were young and really bad as the years went on.
1,worthless,Not even close on this one. The tool does NOT work. After an hour I gave up even trying to find a way to make it work. Worthless! Totally worthless.AD2
2,crutch,"Like the design, colors. Hand grips need to be more comfortible. Like the double adjustments, upper and lower to fine tune the fit.But my biggest complaint is the weight. Most handicapped people need crutches because they have a physical problem, so to add a heavy aid to this problem will probably make it worse. To use these crutches for any length of time will tire out the person."
3,"Great look and fit, Cheap Quality","Ok, this is a really nice jacket, well it could be. I was looking for a ""real"" M65 jacket and got this one by accident I guess. If the real on looks and feels like this one, then I cant wait to buy a couple more. Bottom line, nice jacket for made in China. Go buy a real one."
1,Worst Purchase Ever,"I've gotta say that i was really looking forward to receiving this item, to my surprise when it arrived all those expectations went to the graveyard, let me tell you the item that I received is nothing like the one showed in the picture, let me start with the description.1. Item was supposed to be size M, and what I received is more like size L, no fit at all..2. from the picture zippers and snap on pins are supposed to be black, even though it says they are brass made there's no reason for them to be gold colored when they look black on the jacket.3.Seller did not provide a tracking number so i wouldn't know what was happening with my purchase till the moment it arrived.I feel very disappointed with this item I received, I don't mind labeling this as the worst purchase I've ever made on amazon... this is for me a minus 5 star product... a costumer should get what he sees..."
3,It's an okay jacket,"Good construction, insulating shell inside is okay, put on the outside lacks the side pockets on the jacket you can just slip your hand into on a cold day, but has a nice rugged zipper up front and worked very well for me in the cold of winter."
3,Heather Graham book.,"I think I ordered the wrong book,altho this was an interesting read, it wasn't paranormal which is what I was looking for."
5,Strange book,This book is chock full of weird and interesting cases. It makes you realize just how individual and strange people are! The title story really concerns a family who had meals with a mummy! And that is not the weirdest story in the book!
5,Dare I hope JL is back?,"I truly hope this book marks a new beginning for all of JL's fans. I was starting to get worried that we had lost her.Both Jeremy and Danny were fabulous. I believe that one of the reasons that I love the Malory series so much is because JL has a way of bringing in all her characters without drowning out the two main characters. (Ahhhh, but I do love James. I can read Gentle Rogue every day.)"
5,Loved IT!,A new twist on the usual historical romance book. The story of notorious rake jermay was a really inspiring one! I love the character of danny and her mysterious past. There was lots of adventure and also a lot of wit and humour. throughly enjoyed it to the tee~
2,Disappointing,"I enjoyed Lindsey's earlier Malory books years ago, and have been waiting for Jeremy's installment. I think my tastes have matured because the book was incredibly disappointing.Perhaps it could have overcome Jeremy's lack of personality if Lindsey had even a basic knowledge of Regency England. As it is, she displays little knowledge of the peerage, language, social customs, etc. that it's hard to concentrate on the story. Really, it's not THAT hard to understand rank and her story would work just as well if she could get it right."
3,Ho Hum for a Lindsey/Malory Novel,"Malory Novels of late seem to be less creative, characters trite. This one was just ok. Expected a lot more from the much anticipated Jeremy Malory novel. Couldn't wait for the chap to grow up and get his own story...disappointed. Danny was not one of my favorite heroines either. OH well, if you are somehow new to Lindsey I would much rather recommend some of her older reads...Fires of Winter, then the sequel to it, Hearts Aflame . Prisoner of my Desires is excellent as well."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I kind of have some mixed feelings about this one. I liked the heroine and I liked the fact that the plot was different. I did not like the hero, it just seemed like Jeremy wasn't well developed. I also thought that the book focused more on the sex than romance. Overall an ok read but not a keeper for me."
3,Way before many Sword and Sorcery movies,"Somebody needs to inform the official Amazon reviewer that this movie came out about 8 years BEFORE Willow and 3 years BEFORE Krull. Willow and Krull would have to be big budget reflections of Hawk the Slayer, not the other away around. Hawk came out even before the Conan movies.It's a shame that B-budget films don't get the credit they deserve. Hammy acted Hawk the Slayer set a lot of standards for the 80's sword and sorcery genre. The idea of an assorted group of D & D like characters getting together under the guidance of a mysterious magical woman became an 80's cliche. But coming out in 1980 it's literally impossible that Hawk copied the others.To any teenage kid, that machine gun crossbow was a fascinating toy. The movie was a vehicle for showing fantasy elements that later became trite, and often seen, but were interesting at the time."
4,Beautiful music,"I like this CD because (1) it wasn't created in a studio, it was created in a natural setting, (2) it's a great meditation piece, and (3) it's downright good. It reminds me of my trip to Cote D'Ivoire. Very authentic."
5,The Tracker,Good movie. When movies were made with some genuine thought. Today's movies are quite short on good wholesome entertainment which is needed.
4,tracker,ths is a good krs kristofferson western. fun adventure movie. in my opinion kris always does a good job in westerns. as always amazon delivered quickly.
1,Poor Quality,"There is no other way to put it, this thing is pure junk. Very poor quality. Look elsewhere."
4,The Secret Of The Golden Pavilion,"This book was neat, in most all the parts. The hula dancer, the scream, and tons more. This was my 3rd book with lots of action, so I couldn't put this book down. I don't think any of you will, either. I won't tell you any more, since it's too exciting to tell."
1,Yawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwn!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Nancy goes to Hawaii with Bess, George, Ned, Burt, Dave and Hannah at the request of Mr. Sakamaki, a client of Mr. Drew's, to solve a mystery concerning the estate of Sakamaki's grandfather, which Mr. Sakamaki has inhierted. Nothing to rave about with this book. Boring plot. No action. No suspense. Bad writing. Once Nancy and the gang get to Hawaii the book reads like a tour guide. Personally, I wouldn't bother with this one."
1,I can not use it in the UK!!!!!!!,I want all my money back plus postage costs. Why do you allow people to buy US products that can't be used in the UK. It really out of order.
3,Excellent but for manufacturing defect,"I enjoyed this product for the 6 times that I used it, as its powerful blend did what I wanted: Blended raw veggies to make green smoothies. Unfortunately, the cast steel shaft broke in two pieces this morning (while not being used, but while drying upside down!). I returned the item to where I purchased it (The Kitchen Place) for a new one, but am now doubtful as to its potential for another defect."
1,Burned up the second time we used it !!!!!,"This expensive yuppie blender may look good, but it isn't built very well. Ours literally burned up the second time we used it making margaritas and a friend of ours has had to have hers fixed twice. Don't be fooled like I was thinking that this thing is expensive and looks heavy duty so it must be good, it isn't."
1,Blades stopped turning after 3 weeks,"I bought this blender for Fathers' Day for my husband to make his daily smoothie, based on so many positive reviews. Now I'm truly embarassed. The blade stopped turning in the jar after 3 weeks of use. I called the Waring customer service line and she pretty much implied that we had ""improperly used"" the appliance. She said that you needed to partially defrost the fruit first. Uh, excuse me? The manual for this thing claims that it's ""ideal for making frozen drinks"" and the specs say that it can crush ice. Several of the recipes included in the manual call for ice cubes. Are you supposed to partially defrost them before blending??? I'm returning this to Amazon, but really, the folks at Waring ought to be ashamed. Maybe we just got a dud -- both the blender and the customer service rep."
2,Fried Motor,My blender was used only for making margaritas. The motor fried after about 20-25 uses. It was probably the ice that did it in. Too much $$$ for a blender that burns out so quickly.
1,Not so good!,"I purchased this item 14 months ago and it stopped working suddenly today. This blender was not used on a regular basis and was purchased for making crushed ice drinks and other general use. It worked ok for general use but not so good for crushed ice drinks and it has proven to be not very durable having broken so quickly. When I checked the Warring website for an authorized repair center to attempt to have it repaired under warranty, only one location within 100 mile radius was found and their telephone number was no longer in service. After doing more research on-line about this item I found that I am not alone in my opinion of its performance. At this point I have decided not to invest anymore time or money in having this blender repaired because it did not work that great in the first place. In my opinion this product was no better than an inexpensive blender found in any department store. I think its time to move on to another brand with a better consumer rating."
1,Weak,"We owned this blender for a year and a couple months. Used it mainly on the weekends in the summer, to make smoothies with frozen fruit, so I wouldn't say we were heavy users. I burned the motor out today--the unit was visibly smoking after running for about a minute or so. This particular blender was a replacement for a previous Waring that lasted us over 10 years before it died (also from a burned out motor). Not sure if this blender was a dud or whether the quality of the Waring motors is getting worse. I'm going to send this one in for a fix or replacement since the motor is covered under a 5 year warranty."
2,"Fair, but smelly","After having one of the predecessors to this blender for a number of years I wanted a 2nd one. Reviews were pretty good so I ordered. Received it quickly but didn't use for about 6 weeks (AFTER Amazon's return period). Made mayonnaise and was put off by the horrible burning smell of, presumably, the wiring. Called Waring, said to try it a few more times and the smell will go away, or I can send it (at my expense) to their service center for repairs or replacement. Used twice more for equally non-taxing blending jobs, smell still present when using it, will have to return to Waring, and will probably buy something else. Very disappointed for a ""professional"" unit...my first clue was that it was somewhat lighter in weight than the previous unit. Lesson learned: use an item in the 30-day return period."
2,Smoothie Blender,"First off the blender came missing the plastic cap. I went ahead and tried to make a smoothie using frozen fruit, some orange juice and ice. This blender does not have the power to chop up frozen fruit. It would continuously clog up and I would have to get a spoon out to mix. I would not recommend this for anything that requires frozen fruit."
1,Broke after a few uses,"We don't use our blender every day. So, when we do get it out we expect it to work. We got this one as a gift two years ago. We've used it maybe 2-3 times and it has already broken. The blade just fell off in the process of blending a soup that was not very hot and consisted of very soft squash. I will never purchase this brand again. A total waste of money."
1,Loud and wimpy,"From the first time I turned it on I was surprised at how loud it was. The blender sounded like the blade was rattling around or not seated properly. Then I tried blending and the motor bogged down on some pretty easy stuff. When I could smell the motor, I gave up and decided that this wasn't the blender for me."
1,Very Poorly Made,"Professional Quality?Hardly.The blade is attached to a ridiculously flimsy, plastic, domed casting which is doomed to failure.The quality of this blade mechanism is insulting to the consumer.How would I describe this blender? Junk."
4,Best Home Blender,"Don't expect any blender to blend large ice cubes (from trays) starting out sitting on the blades. Always put the soft stuff (fruit, etc.) on the bottom, and the ice on top. When blending ice only, you MUST start the blender BEFORE placing the ice, or you will break them (and it will be YOUR FAULT, not the blender's). Read and follow the directions!I've made more than 1600 smoothies with mine in four years and couldn't be happier. Update 01/03/08: The blade finally broke after some 3,000 smoothies. It takes a socket set with an extension to change, but it's worth it!"
3,Mixed Feelings,"I can't outright condemn this translation as it is the one I read when I was saved and it's the only translation I've read all the way through. I was very fond of it and found it very easy to understand. But I will say that this version did not teach me about justification, propitiation or grace. And, knowing what I know now about it, I wouldn't recommend it to a new believer or an unbeliever because I think it is misleading and takes away from the grace and glory of God. I also wouldn't really recommend the NIV, as it has a lot of the same deletions and revisions as the Jehovah's Witness Bible."
4,"A well researched book, now very out-of-date","Professor Goeckel's study of the political struggle of the Protestant Church in East Germany can be considered groundbreaking, and remains the single most comprehensive study of the subject in English. Written in a somewhat dry style, Goeckel methodically details the theological underpinnings and the complicated organisational structure that affected the Church-State relationship in the GDR. However, his examination of the SED-State apparatus and the actual interaction between Church and State is weak, and his analysis is light.But the reason why this book is so incomplete is that it was unfortunately finished in 1990, just before the East German State and Party archives were opened, revealing a wealth of material Goeckel could not have incorporated into his book. Goeckel's book is therefore an interesting introduction, but must be supplemented by other more recent sources (such as his excellent article in the journal German Politics and Society 31)."
1,NO NONSTICK FOR WOK COOKING!,"You should NOT use nonstick coatings for wok cooking. Wok cooking is extremely high temperature. Nonstick coatings tend to burn away and to ""off gas"" at wok temperatures. Use hard anodized, plain or stainless steel for wok cooking. Use an oil with a high smoke point. For everyday cooking I use canola or olive oils. I personaly use a blend of oils for Chinese cooking. I use Corn oil (or canola) as the base with a small amount of peanut oil (very high smoke point but has a distinctive flavor which is good for chinese thai etc) and a touch of sesame oil."
3,No vocals,While the music is nice. There are no vocals on the CD. It doesn't have the holiday spirit that most CD's have. I was hoping for something to follow the solstice rather than christmas but this just doesn't cover it.
5,Winter Solstice,"This album is everything you could want in music for the season ... soft, gentle, evocative of meditation .... thoughtful music to contemplate the circle of life."
4,These drops were an excellent way for me ...,These drops were an excellent way for me to get three different types of vitamins into my system without taking several pills. They have a wonderful taste -- not the typical medicinal taste. They really help my dry throat and I'd recommend them highly.
3,It's a good overview of,"their creative process. The unpublished songs are just that - songs, too simplistic for them. You may like the guitar on Hometown Special but overall I think it was a good idea not to include those tracks in any of the first records. It could be interesting though for a GG aficionado, all those little bits of recordings, and the album is well-made."
1,Who came up with this thing?,This couldn't have been designed by the folk at Handspring. Their Treo is such a wonderful device but this clip is just garbage! We are on our 2nd one in less than 6 months and it just broke! Don't waste your time -- get the case by Krusell!!
4,strega nona,"This book was about a lady lived in a villige.her name was Strega Nona, nona had a magic pot and she made spegatti out of that pot.Nona was gettin old and she needed someone to do her works at home, she said she's going to feed that person and give that person place to sleep.She haired a guy.One day she was going to visit her friend's she told the guy to clean the house but do not touch my magic spot, when she left he touched it n made alot of sppagatti's he couldn't stop it, he messed up the village,when she came she stoped it and she gave the boy punish to eat all sppagatti's.This book was intresting and helpful for people, because it teaches you not to touch thing's that people tells you not to."
5,Strega Nona is a great children's book,"This item, Strega Nona, came very quickly and was exactly what I wanted for my daughter's book themed babyshower. Great service."
5,Excelent!,"My favorite thing about this band is that they are original. They bring a whole new idea to the electronic Industrial genre. The semi-Danni Filth sounding vocals along with the harsh soundscapes, dark atmosphere, veril technoligy, and hard hitting EBM beats make them a whole new kind of band. They also have a reputation for putting on a good live show. This is a great album, as are all P9 albums. Terror based Industrial stomping music."
4,Original?,"Psyclon Nine sounds a lot like Skinny Puppy, who pioneered this sound two decades ago. I have to admit, though, they are the only band I've ever heard who even comes close to Skinny Puppy's sound.Skinny Puppy was TRULY original. And you can't say that about too many bands over the last 30 years."
5,Outstanding saw!,"I just received my new JPS-10TS and it is as good as the rave reviews in Wood Magazine said it was. I had no trouble with the set-up. The fence is to die for--very smooth, solid, and precise.A few words of caution. The picture on the instruction manual shows this saw on a Jet 708118 mobile base. I ordered that base and found it was too short by 3/8"". See my review of the 708118 and save yourself a lot of hassle by getting the Jet 708119 mobile base, which Jet customer service now agrees is the proper base to use with this saw."
2,Pretty reminisent of Blues in the Night! Potenial Spoilers,"Grave Endings and Blues in the Night are the only Molly Blume books I have read. They have so many of the same plot details it is ridiculous. Supposed suicide, check, mysterious journal pages, check, another supposed family member suicide, check, only Molly thinks it wasn't a suicide, check! Conners doesn't believe her, check. Rich bad guy, check. Landlord lets her in the apartment, check. How many people would actually do that!! Come on, think of some other possibilities. And not to be too picky, but I listened to the audio version and the narrator had a cold through the whole thing. She had a stuffy nose and it was irritating to listen to. I just keep wishing she would blow her nose!!! By the end of the book, I couldn't believe that Zach would actually marry her after she made it clear that her wedding was not a top priority."
4,POW Survival,"This is another excellent movie concerning Viet Nam and Cambodia during the Viet Nam war. If you enjoyed ""Bat 21"", ""Platoon"", or ""Full Metal Jacket"" you will probably want to catch this one. This movie shows how a handful of prisoners try to escape deep from the jungles to return to their base. It is a enlightening and frightening experience. Bale does a great job as the lead character and the rest the support cast are quite good. The character development is what really pulls you into the movie. They make you feel their pain and realize how they were best able to cope with their circumstances. Good quality DVD with standard extras. Decent replayability."
4,Well Done!,Christain Bale did a great job in this movie. What a horrific experience he had. It makes one wonder just how much could one endure?Defintely worth watching.
3,Inspirational...,"Movie based on a true story. Navy airman Dieter Dengler played by Christian Bale is shot down in enemy territory in Vietnam and is captured and held as prisoner with 6 other Americans (all interesting characters and well-casted). Story shows how Dengler survives torture, starvation, confinement and ultimately is the brain trust behind a courageous ""prison"" break. My criticism of the movie is that is tends to drag (read slowwww) and finish is predictable. That being said, it is a feel good ""America Wins"" movie with beautiful cinematography."
2,Not that good,"My wife and I watched this movie but it wasn't that good at all. The seller sent it to us very fast, but after watching the movie I wouldn't watch it again."
1,Just plane horrible. A waste of time and money.,"We thought we were buying ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly."" But instead Amazon directs you to this amateur joke. We want our money back."
5,Excellent physical acting. Suspense has complexity.,"Astonishingly riveting flick. The physical acting from Zahn (Comanche Moon) and Davies (Saving Private Ryan) rivals Hank's Cast Away. The urgent moments to escape from the compound had my heart pounding. The director, Werner Herzog is an artist. One of the rare DVDs I will sit twice through to listen to the director's commentary. Herzog has a philosophy when telling a story."
3,"OK, not great","Many folks like this flick, but I think it left a lot to be desired. It was decidedly low budget. I found the psychological development of the characters not very deep or accurate. A lot of dialoge is artifical and strained. I suppose it's ok, but I wouldn't buy it again; I watched it once and wouldn't care to watch it again."
2,Great Paper; Horrible Packaging That Causes Damage,"This paper is great for high-end, large-format printing, but the first third of the paper cannot be used because of poor packaging that damages the edges of the paper. I've purchased at least 20 rolls of this paper, and it's always the same. There are plastic end caps that get hit in the box during shipping and handling, and as a result the end caps make indentations on the edges of the paper. You need to unroll at least a third of the roll to get past the damaged edges, so you lose a ton of paper, and money, of course. Now, if you don't need to use the full 42-inch width, you'll be fine because you can just trim the dings off the edges of the paper. However, if you want to use the full width of the paper with large-format prints, you will have trouble."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"The Blackcollars were a legendary outfit of warriors, spies andsaboteurs, with superhuman skills and abilities. Earth is under controlof aliens, but rebels still exist.One of them, the protagonist in this book, wants to be free. To dothis, he pins his hope on finding a lost blackcollar unit to aid therebellion.All, however, is not as it seems, and the truth about the blackcollars will shock him."
4,juggalo from new york,this cd wasnt as good as all the review say. it might be good if u like rock but not to good for any rap fans
1,Awful,They are horrible. Some of the worst of the worst I have ever had the displeasure of hearing. They should be ahsamed.And if I ever meet them I'm going to demand my money back.
3,Milwaukee Router Guide,It does what it is supposed to do. I found the micro adjustment was difficult to use and was disappointed that it didn't include some hints or instructions. The adjustment knob would benefit from some lock nut on the threads and a slide adjustment of some type but instead it has a locking bolt (not pictured) that you have to loosen every time you want to turn the micro adjustment knob. I would still purchase it if the price is good. I was concerned another brands guide would not fit my Milwaukee.
4,Cut or uncut?,"This may possibly be the most 'realistic' Foreign Legion movie.Perhaps because it's a European production, where film makers feel less obliged to be Disneyesque or Spielbergish and do not try to twist themselves into a pretzel in order to manufacture 'happy' (or at least conciliatory) endings just to make the highest dollar amount at the box office.An international all-star cast, headed by mega-gorgeous French superstar Catherine Deneuve and German-Italian spaghetti western hero Mario Girotti aka Terence Hill, Mme. Deneuve's presence alone makes this one worth watching.It may be worth getting the uncut version (isn't it always?) or setting up a region-free home system, because the edited version does feel pretty...well, edited...."
5,WHY IS THIS BOOK OUT OF PRINT?!,"I agree with Jeffrey H.: Buy it! First of all, it's a hoot that George Nader wrote this -- he was one of the hottest young stars in Hollywood in his day. But he's a very good writer, too. I paid a lot of money for this tome, but it was worth every cent. I couldn't put it down. Besides an intriguing premise, the futuristic view he puts forth is cool simply because of the date it was written (1978). I have to say that Chrome is one of the most interesting, appealing and sensuous characters I've come across. He slips out of the story for a while; all I could think about was his return. The book's a charming and bold relic of its time and I can't recommend it higly enough. My regret is that Nader didn't write a sequel.BUT IT!"
3,"Some good, some bad.","I found this strangely disappointing. There's a lot of good stuff in here - it's science fiction in the mould of the old black & white films. However, the vision of the earth's future was singularly depressing, and the characters seemed to be victims rather than actors more often than not. It annoyed me that every male character seemed to be secretly in love with Chrome at one point or another. And, sometimes, the author treats everything too normally; he fails to inspire.Having said that, I did like this book. The plot, especially in the first half, is extremely well done and continually keeps you guessing. When you go back and read it again you can see how everything falls into place.You'll have to find a copy and see for yourself."
4,now using it to teach basic Autocad,"I used this to teach beginners to use Autocad, and was very pleased with it because it is what it says..basic. Some of those other books are so thick they are too intimidating to the students (besides costing too much) This book has good ""try this"" examples and practice ideas. I especially liked the ""freezeframes"" of the screen so students know what to look for and what buttons are supposed to be clicked, what their choices are and most importantly if they are in the right place. it was a very self-centered learning for the students as they went thru each chapter they could see for themselves if they were on track. I had less ""i'm lost comments"" than with other AutoCad books."
2,Booster seat carrying bag,"I purchased this carrying bag along with a Compass Booster seat, mostly for use during airline travel. The seat fits into the bag quite well. The reason for my 2 star rating is that the material (nylon and zipper) used to construct the bag seem very lightweight and flimsy and in my opinion it will only be a matter of time before the bag rips or the zipper fails. For the $20 price tag, I expected more durable materials."
2,Varsity sized Ball,Be careful when ordering this item. The description says mens competition ball but it is size W5000 (womens or varsity) not W6000 so look for the right size.
2,Not Thrilled,This was the History Channel TV show. It was boring. See it on television for free. Wasn't worth the $22 I paid for it.
2,GET A PRODUCER!!!,"With titles like ""here comes the cum"" and ""in the rain with no cocian"" this likably sloppy punk/metal unit should appeal to fans of Bootleg Bill, AntiSeen, early Wednesday 13 and the immortal GG Allin. Sadly the vocal mix is SO poor you can't make heads or tails of the gross lyrics! The vocals are even less clear than an 80s GG album (and those were HORRIBLY produced!). If these guys ever amount to a second CD here's hoping they'll check the vocal track before having it pressed n distributed."
1,Can't get to the data,I'm sure there is an lot of interesting data on this CD but as yet I've been unable to see any of it. A few introductory documents are viewable on MS Word; MS Access produced nothing. I am computer literate and an having an awful time with this CD. I'll keep trying and hope its worth it.
2,Eugene Onegin,"I think this particular recording is poor : the singers, the sound quality, the selection of excerpts....Amazon's service was fine !"
3,Might not be good to play on newer computers,"I've played the PC version years ago, one of the best games of all time, and it worked fine. I bought a new version because my old PC is dead. This version I'm playing on a 2008 MacBook Pro. I tried playing it with maximum graphic settings, when it ran choppy and slow I steadily reduced the settings, eventually to minimum, it made almost no difference. A couple of friends who know way more about computers than I do suggested that my Mac may be TOO powerful. It makes no sense to me, but I'd just as soon play the Xbox version if I could find one from a source I trusted. I'll keep trying it, maybe something will change and my Mac will ""get used to it."""
1,This was a poor rendition of what could be a great game.,"I have played the Lucas Arts games clear up to Jedi Academy, but this game really sucked. The controls were terrible, the sorry line weak, the environment choppy and looked incomplete. I played for 2 hours in the hopes that the game would get better or more intuitive, but it just went from bad to worse. The action sequences were slower and more scripted than a board game. I do not recommend this game to anyone, unless you really want a cumbersomely poor graphic experience."
1,Does not work well with Mac,The game continued to crash and game play was difficult with the computer keyboard controls. Don't waste your time with this computer game just get a PS3 or PS2.
3,Healing Celebrations Simplifies It For You,"I have read many books dealing with the subject of personal health care and, generally, feel very overwhelmed and confused by them (and I have a science degree!). Healing Celebrations simplifies all these matters and gives you a do-able approach to managing your health.Dr. Horowitz explains complex biological processes in extremely easy-to-understand terms. He doesn't just tell you what you should do, but why you should do it - and that is a great motivator. Very positive, very encouraging - no fear tactics, but if you don't believe that there is a loving Creator who has your best interests at heart, this book is not for you."
4,"Standard canteen, does its job!","I bought 4 of these for a family camping trip. They do not have a seal in the lid, so it is a plastic on plastic seal which does generally leak a bit if they fall over. We just made sure they stayed upright in the car and put them in our pack side pockets when hiking. No off flavors, they worked great. Good deal if you ask me, but I will probably put a cut of rubber in the inside of the lid to seal better. This seems like a problem that can be resolved for a few cents, making these a 5 star deal."
3,Episode III: What We've all been Waiting For,"I must say that I was looking forward for this movie to come out in theaters. Sure, all the Star Wars movies are good, but this one really isn't that good unless you are a die heart Star Wars fan."
3,"So, So","I am a cast member of the film and would like to comment on the progress so far to date. I am very pleased with the film overall and will be assembling my own version (as George gets completely carried away with special effects and the like), thereby throwing in unnecessary scenes while cutting the great ones. Anyhow I have obtained and will be distributing over 80 percent of the film in its unedited format soon online of course, in the hopes that fans will edit it as they see fit, thereby allowing for Star Wars to unfold as it was meant to, not how old georgey seems to find befitting in his elder days. I can tell you that there was already over twenty minutes of Jar Jar binks footage which I have personally collected and destroyed. Please look for the new footage on star wars.com where I will be doing a major site renovation and episode III distribution soon. I can hardly wait. What a spoiler!"
3,ok it has a lot of action but still,i really dont know what to put i could have put 5 stars but the ending is just plain sad i mean anaken has just now got out of a river of hot lava and turns into darth vader and pedme on the other hand has luke and leah but lucas had to do that because star wars 1 2 and 3 is the story of darth vader
2,Pouty Acting,"This episode was much better than #'s 1 & 2. It still did not live up to #'s 4-6. And at this point, probably no one expected it to. The casting of Hayden Christensen as Anakin/Vader was a very bad choice. To me, Christensen and Lucas turned Anakin into a whining, pouting character, rather than the truly over-confident, suddenly angry and fierce dark force he eventually became (whom we in the 1970's grew to love). It was very difficult for me to view the movies in order (1-6) and see the jump from a sniffling, pouty-lipped Anakin to an amazingly scary Dark Sith Lord. It just didn't work for me. The Episodes 4-6 are still some of the best movies I've ever seen, even to this day, as I watch them with my 4 year old son, who loves them as much, if not more, than I."
5,This Episode Is Amazing,It has increased my knowledge of Star Wars and will help me have some fun with my cousin who also likes Star Wars.
4,Fitting end,"Episode three is finally here and the ending was well done. Sure there are numerous ways Lucas could have gone, but he chose this way. Other story lines continue in the books which are also well written.For close observers, there are a couple discrepancies between the first and second trilogies. For example in Empire, Obi Wan had to be reminded about Leia's existence when he was there when the twins were born. No big deal. E3 was definitely better than 1 and 2 but still don't stand up to the original trilogy.The one thing that was annoying was skinny Christensen in the Vader suit at the end."
4,Closes the loose ends nicely,"If you like star wars movies at all, you have to see this one. It does an excellent job of bridging from 1 and 2 to 4/5/6. All the loose ends I could think of are closed nicely, and you walk away with a nice feeling of closure for how the whole story holds together over all 6 episodes.If you haven't seen the others, I'd start at star wars and empire strikes back though, instead of this. They were better movies. This one has several drawbacks as a stand alone movie, namely moderate acting and poor dialog in many cases. Also for kids its a bit dark.But if you've already done the other 5, this is a must see, and an enjoyable one."
1,Another disappointment.,"George, after this trilogy of fiascos I am NOT looking forward to Indy 4.I'm sure you're concerned."
5,"Finally, a sequel that almost rivals The Empire Strikes Back","Episode Three is not only The best of the prequels of the Star Wars Series but almost rivals the greatness of the best film in the Star Wars series "" The Empire Strikes Back"". In it's sheer showmanship. Lucas pulls all the stops and makes a satisfying end this series and sets up nicely the original trilogy. This film is so good in fact, that it does make you forgive the last two prequels and makes you respect them as well.Can't wait to see it again."
2,Blue screen of death !!,"I have to agree with other reviewers here about the severe lack of actual sets and props used by mr lucas thesedays, whatever happened to giving the actors something to work with .While I am sure the fight in ROTS will be bigger than anything before , the fact that the actors have no set at all kind of negates them even being there , why not just cg them as well ??The scene in Episode 2 where obi-wan goes to check out his droid army can be clearly seen as all cg, he rarely gets one eye line correct in 15 minutes , then Jango fett appears and its like wooooooo a real person !!! not a good file mak'eth .Peter Jackson got it right , use plenty of real sets where possible and do the crazy stuff in post.Bring back the reality and give the actors something more tangible to work with than someone waving a stick about trying to get the idea across that you are in a volcano or something when you can see pizza hut out the window !! (hmmm is the buffet still on ? )"
1,"Face it, Lucas, drama isn't your strength","While the graphics and creatures are fun to watch, the acting and script were, if this is possible, worse than the previous two. Lucas did a great job with the old three because he was making them as action adventure movies. In these new three, he attempts to portray drama and it comes across cheesy, fake, and often laughable. The dialogue is cliched and poorly delivered. There have only been three good actors in these new three movies, and two of them let us down in this finale. Christopher Lee by dying in the first scene and Ewan McGregor by having zero zeal in his delivery. Lord Sidious was excellent on the other hand, outshining anyone else in the poorly casted entourage. The one redeeming part of the flick? No Jar Jar Binks."
3,"Finally, the end!!!","My opinion in this third and last episode of the Star Wars Saga, is that this one was the most graphic of the six. Star Wars Episode III was like an 'intergalactic light show' with lots of action, and with some gruseome scenes.I thought that what happened with Master Windu was a sad ending to a great Jedi knight. And Anakin's interest in the dark side of the force was brought on too quickly, but was still convincing at the same time. As always, Master Yoda kicked butt in his lightsaber match against Palpatine, even though it was a draw.But nonetheless, this was still a good ending to a long saga. But I'm glad that Palpatine got his in the end (""Absolute Failure!!!!"") So long Empire. Congatulations to the Alliance on a job well done."
2,Dissapointing,"As a massive star wars fan this was a titanic dissapointment. The battlescenes are not bad (though the space scenes were like a bad videogame) but then there is the dialogue. erk. The story is dragged through by some of the worst acting imaginable! Christopher Lee - Outacts everyone in the filmSamuel L Jackson - not bad at allHayden Christensen - the. worst. performance. ever.Ive seen more emotion in a brick.The battle of Kashyyyk is the highlight here. We also have the ruination of Yodas sage like demeanor. Jumping around like that has ruined yoda. sorry.One star for Christopher Lee and Jacksons performance, and a star for the battle for Kashyyyk (minus the once fantastic Yoda)So dissapointing."
3,what?,what the hell are you guys talking about? this movie isnt even out yet. why dont you wait until it drops before you start talking about how much you like/dislike the movie. get bent geeks!
4,important part of the whole,"This is not my favorite Star Wars movie -- it's very dark -- but it is an important part of the whole saga, and, watching all six episodes, it helps to make one heck of a good story!"
3,An Excellent Light Show!!! Now how about an actual movie?,"I've got to hand it to Mr. Lucas, he sure can create an amazing display of special effects! So why is he writing and directing? I think he should stick with what he knows, and leave the complexity of character development to a more qualified candidate. Overall, this movie was, in fact, entertaining; but not for ""good movie-making"" reasons. Unlike the last two ""prequals"", I'm not feeling cheated out of my hard-earned money, but, somehow, I was left dumbfounded by the way the story had to be compressed to make way for more action scenes. I felt as if I was watching a movie, and the person next to me was consistantly fast-forwarding to the ""good parts."" In a way, though, this did spare me the agony of sitting through more of that overbearingly, god-awful dialogue! So, in conclusion, I guess I couldn't be happier the story wasn't extended more. (Right?) I'm so confused! Why, George, why?!"
4,Ties together all the loose ends,"While RotS is not perfect, it does tie the 2 trilogies together nicely. It shows the ships that later evolve into TIE fighters, X wings, Rebel Cruisers, and Star Destroyers (although the ones in this movie look more high-tech for some reason). We also find out:-why Vader needs the black suit-why Palpatine's face is so disfigured-how most of the Jedi were wiped out-that all 4 of Vader's limbs are mechanical-why Yoda and Obi Wan disappeared when they died-how Luke ends up on Tatooine and Leia on Alderrann-who was born first-how Padme dies-how the Republic transforms into the Empireand of course,-what causes Anakin to become Vader"
4,"Have Padame See a Doctor, Before You Join the Dark Side Anakin!",Episode 3 is finally here. The last film is sometimes on target and sometimes off. I was disappointed that Chewiebacca had such a minor role. I would have loved to have seen him shoot his laser bow just once. The sound of General Grevious' voice wasn't meancing enough. I kept on hearing about how this character is like Darth Vader on steroids but he just sounds goofy like he's from Jar-Jar's tribe. Scenes involving the formation of the Rebellion were sadly deleted. The opening space battle is not as emotionally satisfying as other space battles in the saga. I'm going to be the odd man out and say episode 2 was the best prequel.
1,Void of inspiration and quite boring..,"I wish I could write some review full of praise and positive emotion but I can't. The acting was horrible, the dialogue quite bland, and the special effects were over the top. George Lucas really isn't a good director in my opinion. I thought the ending of this movie was terrible and what a way to end this saga, but with a yawn. No film has yet to make more money than the Titanic and I suspect this will also fall short."
2,"yeah, it's just as bad as people say","I bought this movie because I had never seen it, and my 5yo got so interested in Star Wars that I bought all 6 movies. But being a fan of the original 3, I really think this is a terrible movie, and Christian Hayden is just TERRIBLE - and there is zero chemistry between him and Natalie Portman, it's just not believable. But - it's part of the series and I couldn't NOT have it in our collection."
5,GUNNA BE AWESUM!!!,"THIS IS GUNNA BE THE STINKIN BEST STAR WARS MOVIE EVER MADE!!!NO, I DID NOT ACCIDENTLY HIT THE CAPS LOCK KEY BUT WHO THE HECK CARES BOUT THAT!!! PADME DIES (dunno why but i absolutly hate her and god only noes why lol), WE R GUNNA C ANIKIN TURN INTO DARTH VADER, AND THAT 1 KID WHO SEZ IT STINX IS DUM. THE PROBLEM WIT ALL THE PEEPLE WRITIN THE REVIEWS FOR STAR WARS EPISODE 3 IS WE R TOTAL IDIOTS CUZ WE DUNNO IF WE R GUNNA LIKE THE STINKIN MOVIE!!! GOD!!!Sorry i had a lot a energy lol well i did not noe that Qui-Gon-Jin cums back as a spirit but, COOL!!!"
3,Dang Yo,You mean tell me you would like a movie with Samuel L Jackson in it......Dang you slippin aint ya!!!!!
3,Vader is coming back!!!,Looks like this isn't gonna be easy to save skywalker life. What will happen to him. How does he become Darth Vader? First time I saw all the episode before episode 1 shows up. I have all Star Wars troligy DVD's now. I have to sell all these video after I have dvd. What to happen his wife to get killed. she having a baby already? Two children's named Luke and Leia. Where is gonna be safed anyway?
2,I am an ORIGINAL Star Wars Fan,"This movies have no mystic, no magic, no passion, they were just made to collect money. There is no chemistry between the characters, the humor is lame, the acting of the main character... worth laughing, in fact you do laugh when it's supposed to be a serious scene. This last prequel episode was the last chance to redeem the lame storyline beneath this beginning, and, as expected after seeing Episodes I and II, it did not stand on it's own and it's years light behind the chemistry, the passion, the plots and characters from the ORIGINAL STAR WARS SAGA, the Star Wars we all want to remember; Darth Vader as a menacing man with a dark past, not a wining kid that cries all day and moans about Padme... for God's sake, I am a Star Wars Fan, but an original one, this new prequels I prefer to forget, all of the three. Nice fights and nothing more; even the effects of the old ones are more believable than all this computer generated exagerated stuff. Move along, move along..."
3,"Good, not great","Saw this yesterday, and was frankly disappointed. Granted the bar has been raised for what an audience expects from a sci fi film since the first SW movie came out, but this really could have been better. I agree with a previous poster that said Palpatine and Obi-wan were the best characters in the film. Also agree that Padme didn't get out much. I think she was outside of her house twice in the whole movie. What, is Padme agoraphobic now? In my best Yoda voice, ""Tie up the plotline, it did"". Go see it once just for curiosity's sake, but this was not the Grand Finale I expected from George Lucas."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"Oh my gosh, I have no idea whats the big deal with this movie. I was bored to death on the whole movie. The fights looks so fake and the acting is even worst. The special effects are v good but thats all I found interesting. The big finale lacked passion in my opinion and wasnt that clear either. I guess Im gonna get yelled here for saying all this but trust me, Ive seen lots & lots of movies & Ive seen movies with way lower budget much better than this. Thanks Gosh its over."
1,Horrible!,"This has to be the WORST of the Star Wars saga and I grew up with the originals. The characters could have been played with cardboard cut outs; they were so stiff and robotic. The reason Anakin turned to the dark side was also pretty lame and the film failed to show any torment on his part. Oh, well, I'm on the dark side now! Even my kids thought this was a horrible film!!"
2,Not the best of Star Wars,"I read the book prior to seeing the movie. I found the movie too rushed and scenes left me wanting more. It was like half the conversations were completely left out. Not just conversations but entire scenes. Padame's role was pretty usless in the movie. She had no spark. My husband and I were confused at first thinking they substituted Natalie Portman with another actress. She looked a little different and her voice seemed odd at first. Not sure why. As for the turning of Anakin to the Dark Side, it was only slightly hit upon what his internal war was. It wasn't just Padame and if I hadn't read the book I would have been like, ""This is it? This is the only reason he turned?"" The movie basically fell flat for me. I doubt I will watch it a second time. If you want the full story, read the book. Regardless though, you have to watch it once just for the closure."
5,This is the Star Wars to see.,"Even if you're not into Star Wars you can appreciate and enjoy this movie. It moves and there's lotsof soap opera-like relationships. The visual landscapes are breathtaking and the death of Padme really really sad. I really think you should see this movie especially if you're unfamiliar with Star Wars because that means you're missing out on what most of the world has been talking about for the last 30 years. Screw the reviews and enjoy this film as the esential movie to tune you in to the fantastical world of space, science fiction and the future. Highly recommended."
5,The Force is strong with this one,"From the opening shot of this movie, like the previous five it had me. I'm one of the few people that did like episodes I and II, but they did have their down falls, but for episode III the only down fall for this one I thought was one line by Padme ""hold me like you did by the lake on Naboo"" but it was excusable for the fact that all the Star Wars movies have a few moments like that for dialog. Overall I loved this movie, I think it is up there running close to Empire Strikes Back. It was the perfect tie in for the original trilogy, plus Hayden Christinsen improved greatly from episode II. For anyone that is a fan of the originals and not of the first two prequals, this is the one for you, it has elements of the originals and makes you really feel for Anakin. I've seen it twice so far and it was just as good, if not better the second time around since you catch everything and not just sitting their amazed like the first time you see it."
2,Star Wars III,"I didn't like that much, i saw it because of so much hype. It did explain a lot about previous episodes and the graphics were great. But the conversation was dull and boring, it didn't have any depth to it (read between the lines meaning). I hoped for it to be a deeper movie than that."
4,STARWARS 3,"Just take it for what it is I guess. I remember waiting, dying actually to see Clones. And half way through putting my hands over my eyes in shame. "" I can't breathe without you Pademe"". See what I mean. That was so uncomfortable to listen too I almost died laughing, and that was the last thing I wanted going in. But fear not GL claims this one is diffrent and at least he acknowledged that Clones was corny and that he did that on purpose. Thank god because I thought he didn't know.But this is the deal... If this was a football game, after the minuses of Clones, GL is looking at under 4 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter and he is now down by two touchdowns. He is going to have to pull out all the stops and start scoring to have any shot at redemption. The clock is ticking"
1,Stupid,"How is Anakin the chosen one? Lets review his accompolishments: 1. Kills his wife 2. Blows up a planet (Alderan) 3. Slaughters childeren 4. Kills all the Jedi 5. Kills Palpatine (so that makes him the chosen one?) in ROTJ.The Dialogue was crap. Movie seemed like one big video game. Wouldnt the movie has been better had they completely cut out General Grievous character and shown Anakins turn to the darkside with more details. Also, Why didnt Anakin kill Palapatine after immediatly realizing he lied and didnt help him Save Padme. Im 12, and I can think of this. Why cant Mr Lucas? What the &*%#?"
1,This is like a playstation game,After seeing the first 2 fag star wars i didn`t expect this to be any better and i was right.The acting in this movie is terrible especially Anakin skywalker he is so stupid his dialogue is suitable for a reatard trying to speak english properly.Don`t see this movie unless you enjoy wasting your hard earned money.The star wars movies from 1977 to 1983 were excellent but no big fat duck man had to puke out this vomit and completly DESTRU the star wars series.We had tomlive with the facts star wars has been DEMOLISHED.
3,the acting,"i want to like this movie, i do. But the acting! its to much. Everyone looks confused. The special effects are stunning, but those scences where people are talking gots to go. By the way Empire strikes back is the best star wars."
2,Darth Vader .... a paradox of whining.,"It took me a while to realize why the emperor was forced to put that mask and voice contraption on Vader. He designed it as a whine filter to shut the kid up. Did anyone else find Skywalker to be a whiney tantruming spoiled child? I just wanted to send him to his room. I can't figure how he would become the most feared man in the galaxy.That said, and given an even lower quality dialog with repetitions and reminders and repetitions ... did I say repetitions. The movie failed to delve into his change to the dark side instead focusing on his love affair and fear of loss. One morning he woke up with dark circles under his eyes ... and poof ... he became the dark lord. Well I have to say, I feared loss when I walked up to the box office. After watching this depressing excuse I crossed over to the dark side ... I left as Darth Appalled ... :::breathe breathe::: ... master of the dark side of Star Wars plots."
2,"I know this movie is darker than the others, but...","...the story was just not that good. The last of the Star Wars films just confirms how bad the acting and dialogue was in all of the first three episodes.For example, consider how fast all the ""loose strings"" were tied up at the end to make way for ""A New Hope"".George Lucas should have hired better writers, and put forth a better effort into writing a better story, even stretching it out over, say, five movies, instead of being constrained to the three-episode format.On the brighter side, the dogfight scenes were visually very stunning, showing how far the franchise has come in the special effects department since 1977."
1,A horrible ending to a horrible trilogy,"I've always loved the original trilogy, but these prequals are just awful. This episode 3 was probably the most dissapointing. I had hoped that maybe lucas could salvage this horrible trilogy but he just made it worse. Horrible acting and writing really sent this movie down the toilet. The only slightly decent thing in the movie was the lightsaber scene between anakin and obi wan."
3,galaxy full of amnesiacs,1. artoo in the future can't fly or is it bcoz it got promoted and enjoys being lifted up by a magnet or its chip got screwed that it forgot that it's capable of flying.2.Can we just assume that Owen Lars didnt bother to look at CEPO's identification numbers after boughting it? Or Owen doesnt rem'ber CEPO once owned by him.3.Is there an undercover scheme between Obi/Ben Kenobi and R2D2 that they must act as if they both dont know each other in front of Luke or Ben's just to old to remember?4.Everybody's including the great empire forgot to enlist the use of droids to attack the rebels. their more cheaper and faster to produce than the stormtroopers and was once own and deactivated by Vader under Palpatines order.5. Leia talks about her remembering her mother which actually died when she was to infant to remember.Or did she thought that was her actually mother and that she didnt knew the truth? Or maybe she just cant remember who is who..oh darn it..why cant we all remember??
4,"Finally, a good new Star Wars","Ok, I watched the other 2 just for the story, but this movie made it worthwhile. For anyone that has wanted to know how Anakin becomes Darth Vader, this won't disappoint."
1,"Please make them stop! What, they did? Thank goodness!","Decided to try out one of the ""new"" versions and this was supposed to be the best of Episodes 1-3. Oh. My. God. Crappy story, terrible ""acting"", incredibly poor casting, and the special effects haven't come far in all these years since the original Star Wars movies, have they. At least it's over. We can hope. On the other hand, just saw the new Star Trek movie with the youngsters, and that is a great movie. So there you go."
5,Brings it all together.,"Obviously the best of the whole series.It answers all the Questions you may have had, special effect are outstanding, story line is excellent and I am anxious to own it on DVD."
5,The finalie of finales,this end to the star wars saga i s great. It fills in all those burning questions like how the emperor got deformed how anakin turned to the dark side. I got a bootleg yesterday and its just how it looked in the movies anyway the anakin vs obi wan batle is spectaculer. Here are the lightsaber fights in order:anakin obi wan vs count dookuobi wan vs generel grivousmace windu vs palpitine yoda vs palpitine anakin vs obi wan
3,Second Half Movie,The only reason I wanted to see this Star Wars was to see how A.S. became Darth Vader. The first half of the movie lags and is boring but it picked up when the chancelor got arested then I actually got interested it. The acting and dialog is really bad. Overall the movie is not bad so I would recamend it for the second half of the movie and the special effects not the acting.
1,Not Worth the Price,"If I had seen this clock in a brick and mortar store I wouldn't have payed more than $10.00 for it. They can't even supply the correct instructions for this clock. As soon as you install the battery (assuming you can find where to install it, they don't tell you where) absolutely nothing happens as are stated in the instructions. The wood case is garbage the pieces don't fit together properly. Save your money, unless they lower the price to $10.00. The only good thing to say is that it was packaged very good."
1,a duez,"""modest"" size is an overstatement- small book - very small print - my copy has overshading on the print - very difficult to read - impossible for ""poison tree"" -beautiful poetry - terrible delivery - of course, printed in china"
5,Beyond all expectations,This documentary will keep you on the edge of your seat. You will also feel the emotions of these tightly knit families as they share how there moments of grief have borne much fruit in the salvation of many.
4,"You Can't See, Seriously You Can't..","This is such an awsome recording, its bloody hard to find here in Australia, took me weeks to find the cd, and everyone i know who has this album loves it. The best song on the album hands down is 'You Can't See' Killer beet and Kool Keith dose some of his best ever rap. And Once you've seen the music video you'll love it more. Its a must get."
1,non functional,This item arrived missing the swinging door. It was also scuffed from the way it was packaged. I don't recommend it.
5,Love this product.,I do not know why I did not try this type of product years ago. A snap to use. Boiled eggs come out perfectly. This would have saved numerous eggs over the years. Will never be without one in the kitchen again. I highly recommend it.
5,Egg Piercer,"Every now and then something comes along which is very useful. Many times we buy things and never use them. This egg piercer I use a lot. I am always making hard boiled eggs because I like them. This item is very easy to use and convenient to store but watch out because it's so small you can easily lose it. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to make hard boiled eggs for salads, potato salads or just eat them as they are. It was shipped right away and ordering was easy."
1,Buyer Beware of Software and Support,"If you intend to use this with a Tungsten E2, think twice. For the E2, the instructions require you to install the navigator software directly on an expansion card (not the device). The installation software does not give you the option to install the navigator software on an expansion card. The software vendor (TomTom) has no customer service telephone number, and did not respond to three weeks' worth of e-mail requests for support. When contacted for assistance, Palm first directed me to TomTom's website. Then they regurgitated information already posted on Palm's website (none of it helpful). Then, their e-mail system refused delivery of my last three replies to one of their messages. This GPS Navigator will end up in the trash bin."
5,Excellent book!,"As most people who know who Larisa is will agree, she is a wonderful person. The book is brilliant too! Larisa-if she ever drops by-don't take any notice of the type of people who write things like the person who wrote the other review; you know what THEY want...although you are beautiful! Do you think Alex Mack's GC-161's given abilities are freaky? Do you play the piano? Well, I've got to say a few things to round off; great book, great job on doing Alex Mack and letting all the viewers enjoy it and I (and alot of others too!) wish you all the best for the future, where ever your path may lead you!From Ian. END"
2,awful quality control of this product.,I have both a wired tablet and this recent purchase of a wireless tablet. It sucks! The battery life has continually gone down since the first day i bought it and will barely hold a charge for more than an hour. The pen has been replaced twice and overall it just sucks. I hate it- dont buy it!
5,Gem of a Copland recording,"Would consider the Copland pieces the highlight of this release. Have often listened to the Copland sonata on the commute through Pleasanton, knowing the pianist was just around the corner. Mark's uniquely colorful tone quality works well with Copland & Brahms but not as much with others.Most of today's pianists don't take their music seriously. Mark still tries to bring a unique sound to the music where other pianists beat it out and move on to the next gig."
5,Major Space Saver!,"What to do when you have so many dvds they no longer fit on shelves, carousels, drawers? I mean was my whole living room turning into a dvd sanctuary? I bought this and am now hearing the heavenly sounds of freedom from dvd clutter! The double pockets, per liner are fantastic, as most dvds come with a second disc, and the extra pockets in the front are perfect for extras, and randoms."
1,False advertising. Does NOT have 3-ring binder.,"I really, REALLY hate the cheap ""Quick-Lock"" system that Case Logic switched to, and was trying hard to find one with a 3-ring binder. This product was advertised to have a 3-ring binder, but that was not the case. Also, if you have to return from this seller (Triplenet Pricing), you have to pay for shipping. Why do I have to pay to return an item when it was falsely advertised??"
1,The latest version fails to meet expectations,This version released late 2005 is obviously a cost-cutting result. This release drops the zipper which is essential when travelling. Also the price have doubled compared to the previous style.
3,Needs improvement. Could be the best,"It's a beast- huge and heavy when full, and awkward when handling. But gets the job done at 2 dvd covers per page. I have the biggest problem with the ""quick lock page system"" It's a nightmare. Would be ok if you never bought another dvd again or just did not want to keep them in some kind of order. the other down side is the material used to cover it. It is like pleather, cheap and does not look the best. I've just seen better material used by case logic and prefer the old 3 ring binder system over the patented quick lock page system. This was the best of the options I could find on the internet and in stores, which is the only reason i bought it."
5,Space Saver,"I bought four of these binders for the soul purpose of saving space. When I decided to put my sons movies in one for him to look at I decided it was the best purchase. I also put all of our video games in one which is convenient when my step son plays games, now I don't have to hunt down which case he put the game in."
3,it does what it's intended to do...,"We wanted to reduce the clutter in our house and ditch all of the DVD/blu-ray cases. This case is bulky, but it does what we wanted.As others have said, don't carry it by the handle, or the discs will slide around.My only complaint is that I would like to store the disc and insert all in 1 spot to allow for more discs per book. We ended up cutting our inserts to attain this goal."
3,Really only holds 50 titles,"I saw this DVD wallet in best buy a few days ago. It is really nice, but BEWARE... it only truly holds 50 titles. The 80 refers to some of the movies taking two DVDs for one title."
4,Fun,It's very sad wandering around the halls of the castle as Frankenstein trying to solve the mystery of your death and listening to the rantings of a mad scientest but it was entertaining too. I liked the puzzles and the storyline although some of the puzzles stumped me for awhile.
4,Frankenstein,"I loved Tim Curry in this game! Moving around in this game was difficult for me because I lose my sense of direction in secret passages, tunnels, mines, etc. There are several mazes that I had to get help on. Thats probably just me. There were a couple of weird things in the game, (Like Sara). Overall a fun experience."
3,OK if you're promoting seminars...,"This book seems to be more directed at those who wish to promote themselves through public speaking. For the rest of us who just want some good, straightforward information on how to become better at speaking in front of a large group, it falls short."
5,Purchased book as a gift,"Because I purchased this book as a gift, I cannot attest to its value, except to say that I've heard that this author and his book are very good."
1,"Wrong Product Shipped, amazon wants to do a replacement with 3-5 week shipping.","The wrong product was shipped. Amazon seems to be pinching pennies these days. I had to call and ask for a refund. The website would only give me a replacement. By the way, it says 3-5 weeks for the replacement to arrive. This is a starter for a car, I need it now. What if they sent the wrong one twice? Amazon is starting to remind me of my experience with buy.com years ago. Poor product packaging, bad customer service, and shipping junk, defective products and the wrong items."
5,WOW!,"I think this is their best work yet! I can't even get past the first 4 songs. I believe that they spent time with God on their faces before they wrote the songs for this album. Songs 1 and 3 are about the Revival that is going on now and is about to explode! I can't wait until the ""Alien Youth"" tour comes to the Baltimore area!"
5,Always a great product,I have been using Bumkins Organic bibs and burp cloths for years for previous babies and have always been impressed with the quality and softness of the product. Excellent shape and size too.
1,Arrived inedible,"These arrived completely dried up, and inedible, wouldn't even use for baking due to questionable status. Amazon quickly refunded my purchase however. Wouldn't recommend this product."
5,Changed my life,"Amazing book! This book changed my perspective on myself as an American and on the rest of the world. I feel like I was cheated in high school (and college!), not knowing some of the content covered in this book. I believe the main thesis, that history is a web of controversies that students should not only understand but contribute to, is incredibly inspiring and I would have been motivated to take more history classes had I been introduced to this perspective earlier. Overall, I recommend this book to every American -- it is a must read."
1,Too much like a school book.,"I bought this thinking it would have short stories. It reads like a text book. Not fun, not a good read."
1,The Most Anti-American Book Ever Written,"I was forced to read this anti-American, class & racial envy provoking propaganda my first year at a public university in PA. Do these liberals have any integrity or are they just set on brainwashing our youth? Mr. Lowen hates America. Period."
1,Marxist Americans Unite!,"As a history teacher I thought this book could enlighten me, but really it only depresses me. According to Loewen, everything good about American history (and America) is a fake distortion by WASPs (White Anglo-Saxon Protestants)...wait a minute, America IS great! Columbus IS the first American hero. Washington SHOULD be honored. It IS okay for Peace Corps members to grow intellectually, even SPIRITUALLY; Vietnam WAS lost because a Democrat president escelated it, and hippy protestors gave aid and comfort to the enemy.This miserable author is either a liberal Democrat, a former hippy, a member of Barack Obama's church, a Marxist, or all of the above. Well, I'll just pray and ask God to forgive him for wasting a bit of my life by reading ""Lies My Teacher Told Me."""
3,"Right on about public school history teaching, but...","Mr. Loewen is right on in his point that History textbooks in our public schools, and History teaching in general, only tell part of the story, and that part is greatly influenced by individual agendas. The author makes a valiant effort to be non-partisan and objective, but once in a while he can't help inserting jabs against people, groups, or ideas that he doesn't agree with, and his liberal stripes occasionally appear. However, his research and writing are stellar and he makes many, many valid points.The book's thesis - that the teaching of History in our country has been watered down, disjointed, incorrect, and even revised according to textbook writers' agendas - is a much-needed analysis and should be required reading for all public school teachers. It's actually rather frightening that our history is taught with such prejudice and outright revisionism."
5,A solution to voter apathy,"After many years of debate, the question of how to resolve American voter apathy is at hand! First, make reading this book mandatory for anyone who wants to vote. Second, make reading this book mandatory for anyone who would prefer NOT to vote. Finally, make reading this book mandatory for anyone who chooses to express an opinion about government or politics.This book challenged so many assumptions I unknowingly brought to bear that it was sometimes overwhelming and often exhilirating. The book rings with honesty and candor; it manages to be thoughtful and provocative without ever being pedantic or condescending.After thirty years of reading, I have a pantheon of books I consider best of class. Of the many hundreds of books I keep, the pantheon contains five volumes.""Lies my teacher told me"" is the sixth."
3,Good ideas don't make up for poor writing.,"Having learned the hard way (poor marks), I learned some time ago that good ideas do not compensate for poor writing. While Loewen has some legitimate gripes regarding the state of the teaching of history, I cannot understand why his editors allowed the publication of such a manuscript. From poor use of the language, to spotty annotation, to haphazard construction, it was difficult to enjoy a book full of errors that, as an undergraduate, I would not have been allowed to commit. Futher, his suggestions for helping the situation (of teaching history) were presented in such a way as to go almost unnoticed. If you're going to complain, you better have a strong argument for how to fix the problem. Right to the end (a point I had not even realized I had reached. Again, weak construction.), I had to strain to find the direction and specific point of the book. It is a nobel argument, and one well worth further research. I'd just prefer better writing."
2,Two stars for effort,It's always so much easier to re-write history after the players are dead and to assign blame to those who can no longer respond in defense. Just give me proven historical data without the personal attitude.
4,Just Say Know,Our education system continues to Dumb Down. Knowing the past is key to not repeating mistakes and growing as a society. Someone should have sent this book to Bush/Cheney. It may not have helped but could not have hurt.
1,Junk,More junk from someone who dislikes America. You cannot build something up by tearing down what you don't understand and dislike. Don't waste your time on a bitter opinion
2,"A Dryer, Dustier Book than Any History Text","This book's cover suggests an excursion through US History to show what realy happened and what gets commonly taught in schools. Instead, it is a humorless, plodding, neverending series of the author's views of what is ""important"" in history as compared with the versions found in various textbooks he reviewed. And again. And again. And again. This book alone could turn anyone off the subject of US history. If you want a good book, try ""Don't Know Much About History"" (I think that's the name) which covers a similar subject with wit and charm."
1,"Africa doesn't for sure mean black people, James!","The author is way too pro-black in his treatment of Africa always meaning black people. North Africa (Algeria, Tunisia, Morrocco, Egypt, and Libya) are actually containing people usaully far more white in their dna structure than black. Yet this author takes it for granted that the moors who came from North Africa (plus the even more white-inhabited west-asian Middle East) and conquered Spain were all black. He also takes Egyptians SPECIFICALLY to be all black too when he alots the African-americans the right to be interested in the Egyptian discoveries of america."
1,Liberal Anti-American Propaganda,"I was forced to read this anti-American, class & racial envy provoking propaganda my first year at a public university in PA. Do these liberals have any integrity or are they just set on brainwashing our youth? Mr. Lowen hates America. Period. This book is clearly Liberal Anti-American Propaganda. Lowen is just another hard-core liberal extremist who wants to re-write American history."
3,A Necessary Topic Poorly Covered,"Mr. Loewen thesis is relevant to anyone with a child in today's educational system, or anyone interested in truth in history. However, he commits some of the same mistakes as those history books he reviews. While the book is rich in references, he too often proposes that ""this probably occured"". Your money is better spent on Zinn's ""A People's History of the United States""."
2,Caveat emptor,"There is much here that is useful and important, but Loewen is, alas, quite a screechy advocate of his positions, not all of which he satisfactorily defends. Instead of puncturing myths, he often digresses into quibbles over words. For example, one of his ""lies"" is that whites took over Indian lands in order to farm them, which statement offends him on the grounds that the Indians were already farming them. But obviously the textbook in question means ""... so that they (the whites) could farm them for their own purposes."" Aging hippies will love this book, conservatives will despise it, and liberals (like me) will be alternately intrigued, irritated, and embarrassed by Loewen's holy crusade and narrow focus."
5,lies my teacher told me,"perfect, everyone should read or listen to this book. If people would they would stop wondering why everything is a mess and realize they are just ignorant and lied to."
1,An interesting project completely ruined by a political agenda,"First off, this review is based on the original version of this book. These issues may have been corrected in the revised version, but I would highly doubt it.Loewen's main gripe seems to be that much of history has been whitewashed. He claims that many of our ""heroes"" had ugly dark sides...and he's right. But, if Loewen's point is that history, as often taught, is nothing more than a series of half-truths, Loewen is equally guilty of the same sin. He clearly approaches history from the left and seeks to negate any positive contributions from the right. In so doing, he would have us accept a different set of half-truths that whitewash ideas that he doesn't agree with. There's nothing wrong with presenting the bad along with the good (and vice versa), but Loewen isn't interested in presenting a factually accurate balanced version of history. He simply wants his ideology to be better represented."
1,Fun and Enlightening - NOT!!!!!!,"The one-star reviewers of this trash got it right - I wish I had read their reviews before I invested my money and time on this nonsense. I have no problem with an iconoclastic view of American history and the author did cause me to reframe my perspective on Woodrow Wilson. I even learned a thing or two. But this book was PAINFUL to get through. I was hoping for a little irreverence, but instead got a whining, repetitious sermon on the ills of America perpetuated by the brainwashing authors of school textbooks. While the author railed against the covert agendas of textbook publishers, it was pretty clear he had some kind of unhealthy agenda of his own. Even after I surrendered, putting the book away without finishing, I still can't quite figure out what that agenda was. I thought this would be a fun, enlightening read, but it was neither."
2,Terribly flawed book,"Loewen should have titled his book, Lies the History Book Told Me. He obviously hasn't been inside a high school history class to see what goes on. The US History team at my school decided to read this as a way, we thought, to gain new information. Instead, what we got was an opinionated critique of history books and accusations that aren't true in any of our classrooms. Perhaps a brand new teacher, who doesn't know anything and teaches straight from a book, might fall prey to some of what Mr. Loewen says, but, in over thirty years of teaching, I haven't met any history teachers who deliver the version that Mr. Loewen suggests goes on in the classroom. The book is misleading and not helpful at all to a person who knows any history."
2,Politics,Started out as a good read. Seemed to be reaching for filler material from the middle to the end. Conclusions were subjective in nature and based on personal opinion. Only book I will buy that is written by this author.
3,good ideas but lose the liberal bias,"There were many entertaining parts of this book and it was somewhat interesting to read. However I find a few faults with it. 1) The liberal bias gets obvious and bland after a few chapters. 2) The title says ""Lies my teacher told me"", however any teacher worth their salt should engage the classs on the why's and what if's etc, even if the textbook doesn't. The author assumes teachers are sheep following the words of the textbooks without anything else to go on.I remember viewing films and reading ""outside"" stories and books that protray the real life of the people in our history.I would have also liked to have seem more causes of falsehood instead of just few detailed cases.This said, the author did do good in bringing up the facts behind true history that need to be discussed in all classrooms."
4,quit the griping . . .,"well, i don't care what all these one-star review people think. i'm a junior in high-school, i've read this book, and i LIKE it. it's not boring, and while i don't necessarily agree with all of the points Dr. Loewen makes, i can respect anyone who has read twelve text books (without being forced to). i'm sorry, but text-books really are boring, and i would rather be forced to read a HUNDRED books like this one through my 'school-life' than ONE example of the flat, toneless <crud> that's been pushed on me for the past ten or eleven years. just my feelings on the matter, folks. this book was refreshing for me. i'm happy i read it. . . i wanna recommend it to my uncle Steve. he loves this stuff."
2,"Just the facts, Mam!","This could have been an interesting and informative expose of all the mistakes and omissions in our history books but the author couldn't resist showing his racial and political bias and getting on his soap box. It might not have been so bad if he had declined to speculate as to why these omissions were made. Furthermore, there must have been omissions that couldn't have been blamed on racism. I aborted the book about a third of the way through."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"How do you take an interesting topic and turn it into mindless drivel? I'm not sure but James Loewen nailed it here. What a complete blowhard! ""Methinks they protest too much"" - see page 220. Or better yet, DON'T. If I want a long boring sermon, I'll go to church. This so-called author is a pompous idiot who apparently likes to hear himself but I am not sure anyone else does. Pass - you'll thank me."
5,Lies you repeat to yourself,"Any U.S. citizen who is interested in history or the state of American education should read this book. In my case, it revealed many instances where the impressions I'd gained from my 6th through 12th grade history courses still prevailed over what I should have learned and retained from several college courses and and the scholarly and popular works on American history I've read as an adult. Shallow conservatives (those who worship Russ Limbaugh and have never heard of Milton Friedman) won't like the book but thoughtful conservatives and liberals will. We need to abandon the use of history as a tool for developing nationalism and use it as a means of advancing understanding if we want an informed electorate able to comprehend challenges as varied as Middle East conflict and Native American poverty."
5,Tremendous!,This is a tremendous resource for teachers of American History. It is thought provoking and provides an excellent and truthful view of this most important subject.
1,All this book is is new left BS to please ex-hippies,"This book is the rant of a man wo is fed up with the way that contemporary history teachers teach their classes. He wrote a long and exceedingly boring text to please aging hippies who want to enstil the age old fire into the younger generation of history students. As a book is is poory composed and the chapters are disconnected. If zero stars were possible, that is what I would give this book. I plead with any teacher not to assign this book to any of their young ideological stustory students."
4,Grappling Book Meant to Be Controversial,"This book is very eye-opening, but avoid it if you dislike liberal bias or very radical ideas. It examines lives of Helen Keller, Woodrow Wilson, Christopher Columbus, and more and subjects like heroification, social class within textbooks, and more. Many of the reviews here say that parts of the book are not supported with enough evidence. Neither are textbooks. Many of the things presented in this books can be easily verified with a simple web search. My advice is read this. You may not like it, but it is eye-opening."
2,More lies,"Didn't much like the book, In spite of the author's claim to not take sides politically his political position is perfectly clear from the first chapter on. He distorts historical events as much as any history book ever has but does it in an easy to read book. it reads like most left wing drivel."
5,One of the best books,"This book cuts to the chase. Its not page after page of fluff and abstract as many Buddist books are. This book goes straight to the heart of what the Buddha taught and not all the ""extras"" that have been tacked on by various sects. Mr. Hagen has an excellent straight forward writing style and he doesnt complicate the teachings. I have read over 30 books on Buddism and this book is light years ahead of the rest. For those who need a lot of airy-fairy gobbly gook type stuff, this is not your book. For those who take being AWAKE seriously..you wont find a better guide."
5,Just wonderful!,"This is one of the best book on buddhism and zen I have read. It is simple, moving and to the point. Steve Hagen is authentic and his words have a clarity and vivaciousness I have not found in many other books on the subject. It is both philosophical and approachable. Simply Wonderful![...]"
4,A great introduction to Buddhish,"Steve does his usual great job of explaining his point in a clear consise manner. Steve explains Buddhism so almost anyone could understand it. Steve's other book ""How the World can be the way it is"" is excellent."
5,"Clear, concise and objective","After reading so many Buddhist texts and being frequently confused by the profound yet ambiguous explanations, I found this book extremely refreshing and simple. It is by far the clearest explanation of the Buddha's teachings that I have read. Hagen clarifies these seemingly simple yet complex thoughts, while maintaining a high level of objectivity.Other Buddhist writers, and philosophy writers would be well advised to adopt the style used by this author."
2,There's got to be more to Buddhism than this,"I bought this book because I wanted to get a basic understanding of Buddhism. Although it was easy to read (hence the title, ""Plain And Simple""), by page 30 I had no clue what Buddhism was about. It seemed like the rest of the book was going to be the same way. If Hagen is doing a thorough job teaching about Buddhism, than Buddhism seems to me to be more of a practice than a religion."
1,Misleading Presentation,"I have advised people against reading this book as an introduction to Buddhism. Although it is written in simple and clear language, the author neglects to define certain key concepts of Buddhism in terms the western mind can comprehend, leaving it open to misunderstanding."
3,"They didn't ""Do It Again""","It's been a long a wait of 5 years. Yeah, they hit us with the single last year and an import CD which is expensive for only about half an album. I also heard some unreleased tracks, some of which should have made the album like ""Sunkiss"" and ""Disco Tec"". Uptown Saturday Night was a 5 mic album so I knew the next one wasn't gonna be that good but got it anyway cause I don't anybody with it. If they drop another album I hope they don't take 5 years and hope they ""Do It Again"" like the first record."
1,Terrible!,"Hermit crabs require much more in a habitat than enclosures like this offer!They come from tropical climates, and have modified gills that need a certain level of humidity (75-85%, depending on the species) to function properly. Notice the grate-like lid? It is not able to keep the proper humidity; one's hand might get sore using that dinky spray bottle to maintain proper saturation. Despite their name, hermit crabs live in colonies, and need ""buddies"" to keep them company. It's good to start with two of these fascinating crustaceans -better to start with three- so a ten, or even a twenty gallon glass aquarium with a hood is a much better way to start. About the only good thing about this is that, instead of gravel, it offers sand. Be sure to research proper hermit crab care before bringing any home!"
4,"Dance, Dance, Dance!",It took a few times to get used to the routines. I definitely work up a sweat. I really like the disco and latin routines. It gets me moving and doing what I love - DANCING! The only issue I have is the cool down could be a little longer and include some stretching.
5,"This product is as it was described, no complaints. Thanks!","This shipment arrived on time, I had no problems with ordering which was a breeze. This product is as it was described, no complaints. Thanks!"
3,Plastic Bags,I'm an RPG gamer and designer and I found these bags are perfectly sized for dice and miniatures. I use them a lot for when I'm giving out trinkets as well.
5,Spinning Inward a great book for children AND adults,"I have been using this book for years in a meditation class I teach. The meditations are original, fun and very relaxing. I highly recommend it."
1,not at all worth it,This was a huge disappointment. It immediately fell apart. We made maybe 3 stickers before everything got jammed and totally broke.
3,refill roll fits the Xyron X,"The sticker roll insert fits the Xyron 150 ""X"" sticker maker, and vice versa. I actually found a Polly Pocket refill on clearance, put it in my orange Xyron X, and my daughter had a blast!The only thing I didn't like was having to cut out the individual sticker shapes before running them through the adhesive... they all come on a roll. If they were perforated, it would be easier... not a big deal for older girls, but my four year old isn't quite that good with scissors yet."
1,So Sad,"My daughter got this toy last Christmas and I was surprised to see it still on the market. I read other reviews and see some people got it to work. I put things together all of the time and read directions patiently. This thing was nearly impossible. It just barely works. Here is an idea: get a big roll of clear contact paper, cut out pictures of whatever you like, stick them on the contact paper with some overlap to create a sticker. Cheap and creative and hours more fun. We were really sad this toy was junk. She had really wanted it!"
4,What fun!,"Saw these guys in concert with Five Iron Frenzy, and found their live music to be very catchy and right in the pop-punk strain that I love. I picked up their CD at a record store and quickly fell in love with ""Sadie Hawkins Dance"" and ""Pressin On"", both of which are filled with energy and high school memories."
3,Pretty average,"Relient K is a good band, and most of the songs on this cd have a good beat. I enjoyed Pressing On, Sadie Hawkins Dance, For The Moments I Feel Faint, and Less Is More. The only complaint I have about The Anatomy Of The Tongue In Cheek is that it's loud and has too much bass. I also get tired of listening to it, but their songs have meaningful lyrics. I wouldn't really recommend this because most of this cd is just noisy, and it sort of drove me crazy. To me, Relient K isn't Christian at all. Instead, they're just rock!"
1,Snot Rock At Its Absolute Worst,"Too bad ZERO stars isn't an option here. These guys go out of their way to sound like a bunch of whining high schoolers. (But wait, I think they ARE a bunch of whining high schoolers.) We're talking socially stunted and minimally talented, with ridiculous lyrics. Maybe It's Maybelline? Puh-leeez. May The Horse Be With You? Gag. And the worst by far: I'm Lion-O. How shallow and simplistic do you have to be to write a song about a crappy cartoon like Thundercats? I wouldn't believe anyone had done such a thing, except I heard it with my own ears. Don't even THINK about using the word PUNK to refer to this band. It's 100 per cent pure SNOT ROCK, as in whiny teeny-bopper airheads. There are good Christian bands out there...THIS AIN'T ONE OF 'EM."
4,God (I mean Good) stuff.,"This is a pretty good CD. Nice, fast drum beats and nice guitar playing. The vocalist has a great singing voice and the band has a generally positive message. One of the negative things about this album, however, is that it gets a little preachy at times. Additionally, sometimes I wish they could sing about other topics that are not related to religion. Not that there is really a problem with religion, but there are others topics in life that could be addressed. I wouldn't want to listen to a CD that was all about how the singer got dumped by his girlfriend and how he can't live through life anymore or how he was picked on in high school and he is still depressed and angry, etc. etc.They did, however, become a bit more lyrically creative than their self-title album. My favorite song is Lion-O (which isn't about religion, but about loyalty to friends).Overall, this album is entertaining and fresh. Not a 5-star album, but something worth listening more than just a few times."
5,"A+ Cd...No doubt about it, son.","If you have read the review about this whole ""not really punk rock"" thing, then you should ignore it. It took me a while to get into Relient K, about a year after they released their first CD I started listening. I don't care what kind of music Relient K plays, they rock! I would tell anyone who is considering to buy this CD to do so. I personally think this CD is much better than the first self-titled one, but the first one still is sweet without a doubt. I recommend either one, but preferably (excuse the spelling) the second. I hope you got something out of my review. Thank you for reading, and keep listening."
4,"Fun, frothy read","Since I'm a yoga fan living in New York, this book was an obvious choice for me. But I'm confident that most chick lit fans would enjoy it.The main characters are Lisa (our narrator), Isla (a six-foot-tall Spanish model), Susan (the gentle, spacey wife of a wealthy Wall Street businessman), Gigi (the tough-talking Queens native) and Margaret (a humorless lawyer). I liked Margaret the least, until she started showing her soft side. All the other characters are enjoyable and interesting.They might seem to have nothing in common, but they're all pregnant and all enrolled in yoga class at Hasharama, a trendy (fictitious) SoHo studio. Each woman has a secret, except the narrator.This is a fun read about the ups and downs of pregnancy, raising a baby, immersing yourself in yoga, friendship and men. The plot stretches credulity toward the end (I won't spoil the surprise) but this bubbly, crisply-written book is the perfect summer read."
1,Battery Tender 800 Waterproof 12 V Battery Charger,"I received the Battery Tender 800 on time. However, I was disappointed in the condition I received it from Amazon. I usually order from Amazon because the items have always arrived in the sealed original manufacturer packaging. This time the battery tender arrived in the plastic manufactuer's container but it arrived opened. The opened container had been placed in an open plastic bag that was placed in a box for transport. Obviously, someone who packed the battery tender was aware it was opened and did not care, since they did place it in a plastic bag. My question is why was it opened? Why would they send a product that was opened? Had it been returned and now Amazon sends products in opened packaging but think that placing them in opened plastic bags compensates?I haven't had a chance to see if the battery tender is operational."
1,Failed at 15 months,Used this to keep jet ski battery charged. After 15 months into a 10 year warranty it has failed. Deltran charges $9.95 plus postage for repair or replacement.
5,Waterproof Battery Tender,I use the charger on a old sports car that is parked outside in all kinds of bad weather. The charger works without any problems and I don't worry about rain or other weather related issues. Every time I use the car it starts with a fresh battery. ct
5,BATTERY TENDER waterproof,"good product. small. easy to use. mounted it in the engine compartment of my boat. Plug it in when i spend the night. Keeps the batteries charged. It is not a fast charger by no means, but it helps if you don't run the engine enough to charge the batteries."
5,Battery Tender 800 Waterproof 12V Battery Charger,So far so good. Using it in my boat while it's covered. Hard wired it so I can see the light during the winter.
3,Blue's Guess Who doesn't flow,"I'm not sure this book should be in the Baby-Preschool section. Maybe it would be fun for older kids but as far as reading to a toddler, it didn't flow."
4,not as good as the origanal,Now don't get me wrong I love Ever Quest but Sony could have made it alot better like better graphics for one and could have paid more attention to the game instead of making a smoother on line game but over all it is good.{mmm... thats good Ever Quest}.
1,Distasteful,"While Quickbooks is one of the most popular accounting programs for small businesses, this book should definately not be. I found the amount of useful information for Quickbooks specific consulting in this book to be rather lacking. The author tends to be overly repetitive about the use of seminars, group training, and workshops. While these are important topics, the space in the book could have been used for some much more needed information. This is also true for the amount of advertising the author includes in the book for his own company and associates. True there are only a few consulting books out there for Quickbooks, but I think this is one to avoid."
5,Ruin Nothing!,"This album is nothing short of incredible. It's a wonderful mix of emo, heavy, and sheer insanity. These kids are in high school, I think. What do they feed them in Atlanta?""ten uh clock heart uh tack"" is my absolute favorite. It begins slowly and builds with intricate percussion and beautifully pluck/strum guitars with just the right amounts of everything, with extremely youthful ""I want so much to be with you right now"" female lyrics. Then all of a sudden they bust out their microtonal and fretless guitars and wail for a few seconds, then are right back into it, then get heavy.All the songs include wonderful songwriting and just the right amount of emotion, style, and grace. My only complaint is that I haven't seen them live."
3,Stellar cast but...,"The cast in this 1979 ""Elisir"" could not be better. Pavarotti and Freni would soon be leaving Nemorino and Adina behind for roles like Manrico and Tosca which would not do their voices any favors. Here they are still perfection in their roles. The young Leo Nucci is delightful as Belcore and Paolo Montarsolo brings buffo expertise to Dulcamara. Gianandrea Gavazzeni's conducting is crisp and energetic and veteran soprano Eugenia Ratti is a joy as Giannetta.This is surmised from what can be heard of the performance. Judging from the applause, it was taped from somebody's lap in the audience. For the most part, the voices are distant and hollow, sometimes totally inaudible. If there is a better account of this performance, jump on it...otherwise, look elsewhere."
4,Darling Daughters review,"I really enjoyed this book. It was hard to put down. I read all 378 pages in 5 days. The first story is about Joanna Parsons, a single mother who does not want to remarry. But her 11 yr old daughter Kirsten, is determined to have her mom marry Tanner Lund, her best friend's dad. The second story is about Cody Bailman, a hard-working, single rancher with a 12 yr old daughter named Heather. She is bound and determined that she is gonna teach dad about romance. She is really hoping he will get together with nurse Sherry Waterman. Both stories are just heartwarming"
1,The Road Less Traveled,"This book was recommended to me...which obviously was a mistake. I was able to get through about three chapters, which I read over and over trying to figure out what I had just read and never making any sense of it. I then took the book to someone else too see if they could get more out of it than I. Written by a psychiatrist...(I should have known that was a mistake right from the start)I just could not get his psychoanalytic gibberish...which was ridiculious. Hello, you head-shrinkers....can you just speak in English and stop trying to prove to the rest of the world how brilliant you are....it's really a bore. DO NOT waste your money on this gibberish. Can I get a refund???? Please !!!"
3,PRETTY GOOD,"This is the book that started it all: when I suffered from my worst ever crisis some seven years ago, it was one of the first books I read. TRLT is not exactly one of the best self-help books out there--Peck's weakest point is that although he gives good advice, he doesn't necessarily have command of what he's writing about--but it's definitely a good starting book for any self-help program. Some other great books, by the way, while you're at it --To Thine Own Self Be True, by Lewis M. Andrews and Even a Stone Can Be a Teacher, by Sheldon Kopp."
2,Different...irambles a lot about spiritual & personal growth...,This book is easy to read and provides the authors insight into a few of his clients and how they grew personally and spiritually from a psychodynamic viewpoint. Perhaps what I didn't like was that it rambles far too much and sometimes I found myself getting lost as what the whole point of the story was all about.
2,Three strikes - I'm done.,"Sections on Love and Discipline I found very interesting and to some degree enlightening. However, I had a few problems with this book.1. On page 61 - the section on Discipline - Peck recalls a male patient that expressed homosexual tendencies. His advice to that patient - date a woman. My next thought, ""Is this guy a homophobe? Why didn't he explore the possibility that his patient could genuinely be gay and might successfully and happily live as a gay man?"" ..but I continued to read.2. Peck seems to brag about himself as a psychotherapist, A LOT. I found this annoying and could not understand how this aspect of the book was useful except to attempt to convince the reader of how great he is... but I continued to read.3. Page 175. Is this guy serious?????"
5,Most thought provoking book I have read in years!,"I read a great deal of spiritual, psychological and medical material and this book intersects all 3 topics in most enlightened way. Anyone who wants to grow personally would find this book valuable. I know it is not a new book was the material is still fresh. Have reread it several times skimming via my kindle highlights to ponder the concepts."
3,Good book on the power of love and unconventional treatment in the healing process,I liked the way we should not necessarily subscribe to a set of rules and how sometimes intuition and the way we care for others is more important than following a conventional approach to healing and relationships.
3,"Too Much Christianity, Interesting Philosophy","There is a heavy emphasis on Christianity and the author gears his advice based on religious principles. I wouldn't recommend it to a secular audience, but if you omit all the references to Jesus, this book is a good philosophical read."
5,My favorite book!,"I had to write a quick review simply because the one that shows first is so negative. This is my favorite book. The writer below seems to be inferring things from the book that I never did... I completely disagree with the author of the last comment. I do not think Peck is endorsing religion, but rather spirituality, but if you get yours from religion, so be it. Why was he so shocked about the patient and sex comment?.... I am not going to even expand on each aspect of his comment... it would just be a jumbled mess... I recommend this book to anyone. It reveals universal truths and every line... almost every line rings true to me and to many, many people. I understand, after reading the last comment, that it may fly in the face of what is generally accepted by the field (when necessary)... just my kind of book."
5,Loved it,this was a great book. Its a book I would read over and over. I have recommended this to everyone I know.
3,So/So,"Wasn't as good as I expected based upon the reviews, but wasn't bad either. Listened to it one time, but it'll probably stay on the shelf from this point forward."
2,Where's the Beef?,"I can't imagine why Madonna, Janet Jackson, or Michael Jackson's VMA performances were not included in this DVD. The most influential artists in videos and performance were excluded. I don't understand. It is a travesty. I hope MTV releases more of the VMA performances with Madonna, Janet, and Michael. I'll buy this one in hopes they will release a really great complilation of VMA performances."
1,"Very, very disappointed","This Little Piggy Went to Prada: Nursery Rhymes for the Blahnik BrigadeI was looking for books for my daughter to read to my 15 month old grandaughter, and saw this book. I read the reviews and knew it would be too advanced for my grandaughter but thought her mother would enjoy it. How wrong I was. I thought it would be some tonge-in-cheek version of nursery tales, but there was nothing amusing or funny about a rhyme that ends with the line ""Time for Mummy to Detox"". The other rhymes were OK but that one line negated any possible enjoyment in the book."
2,Not for true fans of Sherlock Holmes!,"The movie was an interesting slant on Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. It was ok. But if you really love and enjoy the Sherlock Holmes stories, you will, like me, be disappointed with this film."
1,"Ele-Hootery, My Dear Watson. A Bloody Mess Of A Classic Character.","You'd expect that a film starring acting greats Michael Caine and Ben Kingsley would be a success, but when the premise is as shallow as what if WATSON were the brains behind Holmes, you've got a bloody mess of a movie. An abominable mess that should never have been made. View ""Young Sherlock Holmes,"" the recently released ""Sherlock Holmes"" starring Robert Downey Jr & Jude Law, the black-and-white films starring Basil Rathbone & Nigel Bruce or the Granada Television series starring Jeremy Brett & Edward Hardwicke and leave this mess alone."
1,Without A Clue,I was not able to play this video on my DVD player. It displayed as unreadable.What else can I say?
1,Did not know!,I did not know that movies on DVDs had regions. This movie is for region 2 and I live in region 1. The movie will not show on my player. I feel this should have been expressed in the advertisement.
5,"BRILLIANT, FUNNY","Micheal cane at his best, the movie is simply hilarious, laugh out loud funny. unexpected jokes that take you off gaurd and send you rolling on the ground with laughter. BEn kingsley and Cane are simply, ridiculously funny. flawless.if you want to just laugh your heart out? this will NOT dissapoint."
4,must have,"i didnt give it five stars because i didnt have this exact one, but any suction mounted highchair toy is a must have to distract baby while feeding."
1,Typos Included,The product was not what I expected. I found 2 typos and I did not even go through the whole presentation. Some of the grammar was odd as well.
5,Fashion Polly,"My 6 year old loves the Fashion Polly's. Her collection has been growing for a few years now. They are the most played with girl item in the house. I like the fact that they do not take up much space. We have many many many of the Fashion Polly's and they are the first item of choice when buying a party gift for a girl. She never seems to tire of them, and her brother even plays along with her because these little pollys are the perfect size to ride along on a matchbox car.Her outfits have endless possibilites with a few sets. This set is great to keep them busy when your out and about, due to the fact that it clicks closed and everything is in one little case. my little one takes these along with her to big brothers sporting events, and when she starts to play other kids are naturally drawn to join in. While I actually get to catch some of the games ;-) HIGHLY RECOMENDED ITEM."
2,Short range only,"Plugged two into outlets spaced 4 feet apart, got a good signal. Plugged them into outlets on different floors, got a signal so weak that I couldn't get an IP address from the router. And that was only after I switched the positions of the two (I got no signal the first time). So these might work if your computers aren't too far apart, otherwise pass. Find units with higher transmission power (if they exist)."
2,Don't bother unless you only use them occassionllly,"Not at nall impressed. Sholuld have bought something better, OK for a once in a while household user but nothing more."
1,DROP THE BALL ON TIME,"I can define this new Supertramp's new release in one frase: VERY BORING!!Supertramp should have dropped the ball after ""Brother Where You Bound"", which was their last good album.Enrique SevillaMEXICO"
4,The Jukes are always a great live band.,"This concert of Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes showcases songs from the excellent ""Better Days,"" cd, as well as some classics. Highlights include, ""The Fever,"" ""Walk Away Renee,"" ""Souls on Fire,"" ""All the Way Home""(the way it was meant to be heard, not the horrible version Springsteen came out with on his last dreadful album), and ""Having a Party."" The only drawback is the length; just 60 minutes. Hopefully, they'll come out with a full-length concert. Maybe from B.B. King's, where I saw them live in January."
5,Extremely Creative Writer,This book was suggested as summer reading for my teenager. We now have read everything Jasper Fforde has written. He is creative and imaginative. We can suggest his books to anyone of any age who enjoys a mystery and enjoys using their imagination.The Eyre Affair: A Thursday Next NovelLost in a Good Book (A Thursday Next Novel)Thursday Next: First Among Sequels: A Thursday Next Novel (Thursday Next Novels (Penguin Books))The Well of Lost Plots (Thursday Next Series)The Big Over Easy: A Nursery CrimeThe Fourth Bear: A Nursery Crime
4,a book that demonstrates its idea,Original. A change from your typical novel. The best part of the book is that he's worked his idea into the actual book. A page is missing...or the words of a page. Now is this intentional or the working of the evil forces who would like nothing better then to delete parts of a story. Since I haven't read any mention to this in any reviews I am assuming many have overlooked this. And so we see toying with words where they are meant to be is a serious crime. Cool book. Maybe we will find out what happened at the church in the next book.
4,The Eyre Affair: A Thursday Next Novel,"If you enjoy sci-fi and literary references, you may really like this book. It was a little slow at first for me, but then was very good once I got into it. I don't normally pick sci-fi type books to read; however, we read this book as part of our book club. I am the only one out of most of my friends that didn't enjoy Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and it seems like I have heard lots of comparisons. Thankfully this book had a lot of saving graces in it to make it only slightly similar in comparison.The main character was well developed and basically quite likable. Other characters were fairly well developed when needed and played their parts - everything fit together for the most part. I especially liked the antagonist in the book. I enjoyed the literary references through out the book. The ending was good too. Overall, it was an interesting concept in many ways and a good read. I would recommend it."
2,Likes itself too much,"As a flight of fancy this book has plenty of spirit, but for me its cleverness and self-conscious whimsy became a little cloying after a while. The characterization is weak, and, if you take a step back from the story for a day or two, the mass of ideas becomes instantly idigestible. The style also conveys a certain authorial smugness, which, once noticed, becomes annoying. A nice try, but ultimately unsatisfying. If Fforde is truly brave he will do something totally different next time - dare I say, something more conventional? But I expect publisher pressure will ensure more of the same - only probably not as good."
4,I have to be honest here,I am a total fan the serise but this book is just really slow in places and as a result I can totally understand if you can't get into it. I also have a problem because I have never read Jane Eyre before and I realize that half the jokes are going over my head. I plan to read Jane Eyre than go back and read this book than I will be able to appriciate it more.Overall-Give the other three in the serise a shot even if you have a hard time getting into the first.
5,Great Book!,"This is such a clever book! Fforde's style is fresh and original, his characters lively and interesting, and his writing apt and witty. I especially enjoyed the names of the characters in The Eyre Affair.I look forward to reading more of Thursday Next's adventures."
5,Can't wait until Next Thursday,"What a fun read! I felt like this is what reading is all about. Good literature mixed in with sheer fun. Thursday is your typical mystery heroine, but one with a conscience and a penchant for shooting from the hip - literally. The characters from all the great novels make great guest appearances. The characters that Thursday works with are a wonderful eclectic bunch. What great imagination! A quick read to boot!"
2,Not what I bargained for,"I did not enjoy this book, and I felt like the description was not accurate at all. I thought it was going to follow the story of Jane Eyre, but Thursday didn't enter the novel until about 3/4 of the way through the book. This book is definitely clever - you need a basic knowledge of grammar and classic fiction to truly appreciate it, and it helps to be familiar with Jane Eyre, though it's not a requirement. Several times I felt like putting the book down and forgetting about it. I was sorely disappointed, as it was not what I expected at all, based on the book jacket and other reviews I read."
3,An interesting idea but...,"I knew absolutely nothing about this book and I only read it only on recommendation from some people when I was looking for a funny book. Well I obviously have a totally different sense of humour from them because I don't think I found a single thing funny in it. As I hadn't read several of the book referenced, there was bits that I didn't 'get' - these were possibly the 'funny' bits. I also didn't think much about the characters - they felt shallow.Having said all that - the concept of the book was fascinating! It didn't matter that it wasn't funny or that I didn't get some of the literary references or shallow characters because the story gripped me. The set up of the alternative universe was great even if a lot was left unexplained. I haven't read a book like it before and that I did like as it's rare to come across.I'd recommend it to serious bookworms :-)"
4,Clever and entertaining,"Very original and funny, reminiscent of ""The Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy"". Thursday Next is a character that you immediately take to. The fantasy in the book is just enought to stir you imagination without going overboard."
3,A fun read,"In this world created by Mr. Fforde, it is a very different 1985 Britain. England has been at war with Russia for over 100 years, time travel is routine, and classic literature is pop culture. The heroine, Thursday Next, is a member of an elite government agency known as Special Operations. She is being hunted down by the most evil man in the world, who was at one time her college professor and would-be suitor. I rarely, if ever, use the word ""delightful"" when describing anything, but that description fits this book to a T."
4,Hysterically funny,"Not everyone may ""get"" this book, but it is hysterically funny when you do. It has wonderful literary twists and turns, plays on words, and a dynamic interaction between time, space, and reality. Definitely reminiscient of ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"", but refreshingly unique. Before I finished it, I was even questioning my own literary knowledge- I had to recheck my copy of Jane Eyre to see how it turned out!!"
2,I am being generous...,"The premise is good, albeit unoriginal. A writer with a gift could turn this into a fun adventure, like the Harry Potter series. Unfortunately, The Eyre Affair is written in an amateurish, cliche-ridden manner that dulls tbe effects of potentially creative plot. The villain, Acheron Hades, is so hopelessly Hollywood-like, he brings Batman's foes to memory. There's no complexity or interest to the main character, besides her amazing ability to be in the right place at the right time. Again, Harry Potter is deeper, funnier and all around more human and interesting than Thursday Next."
3,Too Much Swearing,"I heard this was a clever book. It would have been more enjoyable if there was less swearing. I made it to page 295 before I gave up (I only made it that far because I was reading it for a book group).Some people don't care about swearing, but if you do, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. Good luck . . ."
2,Still Sleeping....,"While the book held the promise of a good look into a ""foreign"" culture it failed to deliver. I felt like I spent the whole book waiting for the main event. It had no spirit behind it but an un-impassioned woman who seemed to be writing about someone else's life and not her own. So disattached was she that I felt cold. One of the most boring books I have ever read... And I've read a great deal....."
5,"Engaging, Surpising, Immediately Relevant...Read This Book!","Nafisi's insightful literary criticism in a turbulent Middle Eastern revolutionary period is a powerful window into recent history and an important attestment to the universal ""good"" in people in all cultures. Her story also exemplifies the inherent evil that can develop out of governments that are too radical or controlling. She offers a refreshing voice that Westerners wouldn't hear in a news report on Iran. I think this novel chronicles the strength of the human spirit and exposes a familiar, positive light on a culture that most Westerners (Americans, myself included) are generally uninformed about. This would be an excellent resource for teaching literary criticism (on Nabokov, James, Austen, etc.) as well as to promote general global awareness. Unlike any literary critic I've read, Nafisi is enlightening and engaging -- I couldn't put Reading Lolita down. One of the best books I've read. Everyone should read this book."
2,Want a literature lecture? Buy this book.,"This author obviously knows her stuff. She's qualified and makes it a point to share her knowledge on her area of expertise.Unfortunately, there's a lot of rambling and repitition that is frankly unnecessary and unfortunate for a woman with such an amazing story to tell. She drones on and on about literary blah blah blah. But, she's a college professor so it's not entirely unexpected.I enjoyed her stories of Tehran and oppression in Iran. They were captivating, perhaps forced and often even a little over dramatic, but interesting nontheless. She captured the scene and draws the reader (me) into the situation with amazing detail.Still, I would not recommend this book unless you're interested in being lectured on literature. If you are, then you'll love this book."
4,Engaging read,"I had the pleasure of seeing the author as part of the Philadelphia Speaker Series this year and read this memoir subsequent to that lecture. I think the read meant more having heard some personal anecdotes from the author, but it remains a intriguing look into a secretive world I know little about. I think I understand more about life in a repressive society from first-hand accounts. If you are intereted in understanding, or even being introduced to, the inside looking out from an Iranian POV, I'd recommend Reading Lolita in Tehran."
2,Didn't grab me,"Not only am I one of the last people in the world to read this book, I'm one of the few who didn't like it. And I really wanted to like it. I generally enjoy reading and learning about life in the Middle East but this book just did not grab me.One problem was my fault - I haven't read all of the books she and her girls have and they played an important part of the story. But I also found the sequence of events confusing - it's not entirely chronological. I found Nafisi's writing style to be detached, almost arrogant and therefor I found myself not really caring what happened to her personally. I would have like to have known more about each individual girl in her reading circle."
2,"Good Subject, Poor Writing","I made it 3/4 of the way through this book because the subject is so interesting. But I finally had to put it down. Too much literary analysis, too many characters to keep track of, too many timeline changes, and too much of the same stuff over and over. Ok, enough of the bombing, and your girls, and the Muslim extremists. A lot of this could have / should have been boiled down to make it a readable story. I can see that book clubs with time on their hands could use the classic references to dive into discussions about these books and their relationship to current times, but I just wanted a readable story about that time in Iran and how the circle of friends coped. A few literary analysis would have been ok, but it got to seem like she was showing off a bit and diverging from the story at hand..."
1,Not accurate portrayal of Iran today,"The real reason for this book's popularity is that it confirms negative stereotypes. The fact is that Iranian women today are better educated than ever, and the author's personal experiences have nothing to do with modern Iran.So, I would have to agree with the views of Iranians expressed in Karl Vick's article of July 19, 2004 in the Washington Post (""Sorry, Wrong Chador"") that this book has nothing to do with modern Iran, and that the author is pushing her personal grudges."
1,Erudite reading,"Our book club selected this book to read. It was slow, ponderous, and not about a book club. When I sold my copy to the local used book store, even the clerk groaned and said he liked the first few pages but after that, it was way too boring and slow for him. Although this may be fine for the serious student or scholar, it is not a book for the casual reader."
4,Reading Lolita in Tehran,"Reading Lolita in Tehran is a very accurate story about what life is like in Iran today. Technically, it is about a women's book club, but, realistically, it's criticizing all the religious laws in Iran: women have to keep their face covered, every woman is either her father's or her husband's chattel, etc.I thought this book was quite good but at times went slightly slow, and that put me off from reading sometimes, for I simply wished to be done with it. It basically lacked excitement. However, I found the book to be very informative and truthful.Still, I believe Reading Lolita in Tehran is worth your time, as it is a true story coming from someone who lived this herself (names have been changed, though, to protect the women). There are a lot of important facts one must know when considering the situation in Iran."
1,Dreary,"Nafisi writes a book that might be of interest to high school students of English literature, but even her literature insights are prosaic. Her story of Iran is very dull. Her major act of rebellion was to read ""forbidden"" books, but people were always free to read them in the privacy of their own homes.Nafisi fails to present any interesting political insights. The result is that she seems unaware, and one suspects this type of mental retreat isn't very healthy."
2,Lolita,"I really tried to follow this story, but I lost interest at page 100. I felt Azar kept jumping around too much throughout the book. It was hard for me to stay focused to finish the book."
2,Very disappointing,"The ingredients I usually love were all there: a memoir + a focus on women + a discussion of books + insights into a fascinating country. Unfortunately, they failed to add up. Neither the diatribes on the authors nor the personal anecdotes were interesting. This has been done much better by much more skilled authors. Try ""Honeymoon in Purdah"", ""To See and See Again"" or ""Nine Parts of Desire"" for far more interesting, enjoyable books on Iran and Muslim women."
3,Okay But.......,"I really, really wanted to be excited by this book. The topic was fascinating... but this book was just SO SLOW. I had trouble staying with it."
2,I had high hopes,"This book sounded REALLY intriguing, but I just couldn't get through it! I hope others have better success."
4,Good Stuff,It has been a while since I read this but I felt obligated to rate it.I read this book to assist me to better understand womens views on Iran. This book assisted me in so many ways. it was a true treasure to find. I recommends this book to anybody who is vaguely interested in other walks of like outside of their own.
5,A fantastic journey of a book,"I understand the criticisms of the other reviews on this memoir, but feel strongly about the book's importance in the growing dialogue about our country's role in the personal/religious lives of individuals. It seems that any regime's attempt to turn fundamentalist beliefs (Christianity/Islam/pick your faith) into LAW forces citizens to live in fiction. A government's narrow conception of my personal life is not compatible with reality. The law or moral police can force us to fictionalize our public persona, but inside my robe, inside my home, inside my mind - this is real. The author asks us, 'what is fiction?'. Can you confine it to fit reality?. I absolutely loved this book. I found the literary references enlightening. The timeline of the chapters and references required my attention, but it was one of the best reads I've had in a long time!"
1,"Simply, not true.................","What more can you expect from a person who doesn't even believe in GOD? I have been to Iran on a one month trip, and to the school she's talking about in her book, since I am an English Professor, and have found that she has made all this up.I'm very disappointed to see such great imagination used in such a disgusting way, in order to step on her own country, with her own feet!Just like Jesus, I can only pray that GOD forgives her.........."
1,Exploitative dreck.,It is shows like this that just make me shake my head. Does anybody remember when MTV played music videos? Me neither.
2,Negative Vibe,"For those of you who gave a 10 for this book, I bet you money (I rather bet with you than paying Wade Cook for his products and services) that you will turn around and give it a 1 within months, when you lose your wallet using Stock Market Miracles' strategies. The people who gave a 1 had a reason, because they are more experienced and know more than you. One cannot sustain a 20% plus monthly return, or you ll be among the richest people on earth. I personally sweared by SMM and WSMM back in June and July, when I first started trading options and had some initial success like some of you. I got wiped out by September. Thats the life in a part-time trading pit. I give this book a 3 because its little better than WSMM, but I still dont like the sales pitch all over the book."
1,Better odds in Las Vegas -- don't lose all your money,"As a lawyer I have sued a lot of unscrupulous stock brokers, but none of them gave advice as bad as Wade Cook's. If you follow any of his advice you are just about sure to lose your money within a year or less. If you want to gamble, go to Las Vegas or play the lottery instead. The odds are better. If you want to invest, read Peter Lynch or others who, unlike Wade, have actually made money investing."
5,I'm Making 25%-30% MONTHLY- Based on Advice from this book.,"The chapter on Selling Puts (naked puts)is worth the price of this book alone.That one strategy has enabled me to earnconsistently 25%-30% per month. Previousto Stock Market Miracles and based on advice by brokers and financial planners, advisors etc., I wasn't gettingthose kinds of returns in a year!I highly recommend Stock Market Miraclesto anyone and everyone serious about increasing their cash flow. You may wantto read WALL STREET MONEY MACHINE First.Take the critics with a grain of salt. That's what I did. And am I glad that Ididn't let them deter me from implementing these strategies.Our cash flow increased by $8,000 in ourfirst month. My wife, children and I enjoy a lifestyle that would otherwisehave been impossible. One of our goalsis to travel the U.S.A., which we are now doing.THANKS WADE!"
5,There are two types of people who read this book,"those who are making money by applying what Mr. Cook teaches and those who are just dreaming about making money! I MADE $5,000 IN FOUR DAYS ON ONE TRADE BASED ON WADE COOK'S STRATEGIES! So, I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THAT I AM A DOER, NOT A DREAMER! Thank you Wade!"
2,Another informercial!,"Wade Cook's Wall Street Miracles is just another informercial like all his books. Use your instincts when investing and instead of spending money on books, spend wisely on stocks. (I didn't buy this book; it was loaned to me."
2,the decals would not come off paper,"the decals did not come off paper....tried cutting them apart still did not work,kept trying for about 10 minutes and got 2 off ... long story hort they are in the trash and was going to send back but it was not worth it."
2,Too small and difficult to deploy,"Maybe it is that the knife is too small for my hand, but it seemed to difficult to draw and open quickly. Not confident in carrying this knife."
3,B-Side Filler,"Tamia is of course an amazing artist however it dissappoints me to say that this CD was B-side filler. If this CD was an old 45 I would have turned it over searching for the ""real"" songs...I think the song selection was very poor. Tamia's voice is amazing--better than the likes of the more prominet artists today--but she is stuck with poor marketing and producing. I only like about 3 songs on the entire CD and as of currently I no longer listen to it. The song ""Questions"" is another one of R. Kelly's JS girl group one hit wonder songs and ""Still"" which is one of the most poorly written songs I've ever heard. Although, Tamia's voice is contagious and infectious, screaming with power and talent and wonder...this Cd leaves me yearning for more or wishing they'd come out and tell us we've all been Punk'd and release the real CD!I love Tamia but honesty is the best policy!"
4,Worth the Wait,"As an older listener, much of this CD was not to my taste. I really need to give it another go round to realize more positives. It took me forever to realize that the best cut from Nu Day was ""Tell Me Who""; it just hit me one day. I had been drawn to that CD by the wonderful single ""Stranger in My House"". The early cuts on the current CD remind me very much of other R&B singers in Tamia's age range. It was a bit of a turn-off. There were no songs to match ""Tell Me Who"" or ""Stranger"". However, the duet between Tamia & Levert knocked my socks off. Were they ever in synch! Then, when I reached ""Tomorrow"", I realized that my money was well spent. It made the wait very much worthwhile. Just listen to this young woman's voice! A phenomenal talent."
5,Tamia's A Great Talent but is Slept on by the Media...,"I absolutely love Tamia but I feel that she's not getting the attention she deserves. She is a great singer and I am not disappointed with her latest CD ""More"". Of course, no one is going to like every single song that a singer puts on his/her CD (I'm Yours Lately & More) but overall, I love this CD! I listen to it every single day! I feel that she needs more exposure than what she's getting. I guess because she's not gyrating all over the place (like Beyonce and Ashanti), she's never going to be that popular singer. But if people would actually judge a person by singing abilities, she'd be another J-Lo (who can't carry a tune in a bucket...how is it that she keeps coming out with CDs???) But anyway, overall Tamia's CD ""More"" is a great listen."
5,"Breath-taking and Soul-stirring, Tamia","After waiting for the release of this CD for months, I must say it was well worth the wait! This is Tamia's best CD yet. The ballads are so moving that I literally felt them in my heart. Some artists make records, Tamia makes music. She has all the talent of many musical legends of yesterday. I absolutely love this musical effort. Yes, this one was worth the wait!!"
2,a little too sappy and a little too corny,"Catherine Anderson is a good author and can tend to be a little corny at times and this book really was.""Phantom Waltz"" was not keeper for me. It has nothing to do with the story being about a paraplegic, that's a fine subject to tackle and I agree that so many authors heroines are just too perfect to be real. The verbatum and the storyline were just a little on the hokey side for my taste."
5,Outstanding,"This truly was an enlightening understanding, of our Universe!!!Thought!!!!! We take our thoughts too, too, lightly!!!!Thank you Rhonda, and all associated with this creation!Thank you Amazon!!!"
2,Transform?,I found nothing practical to transform my life in this book. I have had much more success with FREE YOUR MIND by Sensei TonyFree Your Mind: The Four Directions of an Awakened Life
2,The book asserting big claims with little evidence,"I have read several self help books. There is only one step in whole book, its content is very minimal.Power of Now is far better book than this. I am surprised about its sale worldwide.There is another problem with this book, especially for Indian readers, the language of this book is much difficult. Usually, I took two three times to understand the meaning of the sentences.I have yet to understand the reason of the bumper sale of this book. One likely reason is this book teaches the path to success without much efforts similarly the religious books teach."
5,"AN ABSOLUTE MUST, MUST READ","Anyone that does not read this book, miss out on the whole reason for us being alive, the purpose of our lives AND MOST OF ALL: HOW TO AQUIRE ALL YOU WANT. After I read this book, I realised that this is what BELIEVING IN GOD IS ALL ABOUT. JUST BELIEVE AND EVERYTHING YOU WANT, WILL BE YOURS. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE READ THIS BOOK!!!!!"
4,The Secret-book,I found this book highly inspirational. It made me focus on how important my thoughts are in creating my destiny. I am currently trying to apply many of the principles from the book to my everyday life. I have also recommended the book to my very good friends.
3,it's good,"The book is in a very good condition, and I received it quite soon after the ordering.although the writing of the book is not as good as I thought."
2,"Great Message, Poor Writing","The Secret really carries a great message. It explains some of the details of how to use positive thinking and has some good quotes. The problem for me was that the writing was actually kind of boring and seemed poorly organized with a lot of filler content. Honestly, this should have been a brief pmaphlet, not a book. But, the message is worth the price of the book. Read it for that and not for the writing quality."
4,Neat Book To Get You In Gear for Success,"""The Secret"" has been popular since its endorsement by Oprah Winfrey a few years back. It is a well-designed book with principles and fundamentals to lead you to success.One of the foundational laws this book talks about is the law of attraction. This law of attraction has been discussed and analyzed by Napoleon Hill- the author of the classic book, ""Think and Grow Rich"". Positive believing is essential but it is only half of what you need to success. You need positive action and direction. Action is critical to get anything done. Yes, it is important to saturate yourself with positive and uplifting goals and direction to attract success. You will also need to ""unpark your car"" and drive towards your goal.This is a good book to initially saturate yourself with positive believing.JR FelisildaAuthor of the book, ""Nanay: Lessons From a Mother"""
2,Cheap Re-Hash,"I gave it ""2 stars"" only because it was can be used as a ""Cliff's Notes"" for positive thinking. Otherwise it seemed to be a compilation of other peoples' quotes and thoughts - a cheap way for Ms. Byrne to make a buck - correction - lots of bucks. I feel like I used to when I was a kid and got ripped off by a carnie at the ring toss."
1,secret,I must have clicked this by mistake and DID NOT want to order it. I hope that it has been credited to my account as I requested about a month ago. This is not right that I am getting this review... please make sure it is OFF my account like I assumed. Thank you.
5,Common Sense Concepts,"The CD was very good. It is common sense information that we tend to forget. It was refreshing to hear. We need that boost every now and then. We do tend to forget with everyday life how our thoughts determine our outcome. I enjoyed the CDs. I wanted to read the book, but just have not made time. With my commute, it was very nice to listen to something inspiring and positive while driving to and from work."
2,Too long ..Should be a 1 liner.....,Typical self help book. Says in 200 pages what could be said in 20.........or maybe 1 line..Be happy and positive in life and good things will happen to you.......there I saved you $20.00
3,"The good, the bad and the ugly","This book was overall very informative. You have to wade through the book and decipher what you want to believe and what you don't. The information on the law of attraction is very informative. What you place in your mind is what you will receive. However, there is some information that you have to take with a grain of salt such as, if you associate with fat people you will be fat. That just isn't so. Also it says if your sick it's because you want to be sick. Do infants want to be sick too? Do the people dieing miserable deaths decide thats how they wanted to die? I think not. Before reading the book keep in mind some information is worth attaining and some is not."
5,Life changing,"""The Secret"" by Rhonda Byrne was a book/cd/dvd that I've heard about for several years. I always listened to what people around me in my office thought of it - mostly bad and negative things was all I ever heard from them. After receiving the dvd as a Christmas gift from my sister, I decided for once and for all to watch it and see what all the darn fuss was about. Ten minutes into watching it, I knew this was something that I needed in my life. I cannot say enough good things about ""The Secret"". It has changed my outlook and I am a happier person because of it. Positivity is the key!"
1,it's no secret,"The only ""universal law"" at work here is the UNIVERSAL LAW OF HUMAN GULLIBILITY, which states: ""Whenever you tell people that they can substitute wishful thinking for real work, they'll go for it every time."" This law has been stated in the past by P.T. Barnum (""there's a sucker born every minute"") and by W.C. Fields (""you can't cheat an honest man; never give a sucker an even break or smarten up a chump."")"
4,The Secret,"For the past 20 years or so, I have been aware of the timeless concepts presented in this book. These universal spiritual principles probably date back thousands of years; they are valid for all people at any time or place. I congratulate Rhonda Byrne for enlisting a number of practitioners to bring these concepts--once more--to the attention of today's generation. It is NOT easy to put these principles into practice, however, since it is NOT easy to eliminate fear and/or doubt from one's mind! Nevertheless it is worthwhile for today's generation to understand that many aspects of their lives could be vastly improved if they could change the way they think. I am totally persuaded that an individual's health, interpersonal relations, financial circumstances, etc., depend significantly upon that person's frame of mind."
4,Thought Provoking,Reading the book has been a very thought provoking experience. It doesn't seem to matter the background of your religion. It stimulates your faith. It is a book to read over and over. I liked all the various contributors.
5,Amazon,"Actually, I was fine with the product. What I am not happy with is the method for shipping. I made another purchase of this same product within 2 weeks of each other. Both times, I had the option of the super saver next day shipping. However, for whatever reason, I did not receive the free shipping and paid $25 for shipping. The method to go about getting the free shipping is very confusing.Thank you.Terri Dowling"
2,IS IT REALLY A SECRET?,"Based on the marketing blitz this book received after Oprah gave it her seal of approval, I purchased THE SECRET thinking I might have missed something really spectacular along my path of self-discovery. Having read THE SECRET, I can personally say that I discovered the message of this book long before this book was published thanks to the works of Dr. Joseph Murphy, Wayne Dyer, Louise Hay, John Gray and many many of their contemporaries as well as my own inner teacher. If you are not well read in the works of the aforementioned authors/teachers, then you will most likely find the information contained in this book very helpful."
1,The Secret,"Are you serious with this? so if we just ""think Positive"" everything will be great!! My father in law gave this to us to read and watched the video. Wow this woman is laughing all the way to the bank. I cannot believe people are still so gullible, but apparently there millions of them. In fact I saw a show about people actually giving away their life savings to gain millions from Nigeria!!! If you buy this book you really are wasting your money and putting more into an elitist snobs pocket, but just stay positive and she can continue to roll in the dollars, while we all continue to suffer through our daily grinds..."
3,time will tell,"While this felt like just another self-help book on many levels, relying on disjointed quotes from famous people I've never heard of, it did, at times point out faulty thought patterns that can limit one's success.Making a serious effort to change certain negative conversational patterns I have with myself and practicing ""the secret"", I have experienced a shift from certain difficulties. While that may not be a resounding endorsement, I also can't claim that it's crap.- C.A.Wulff, author of Born Without a Tail"
1,truth retold,This is simply Biblical truths retold for people who do not want to look into the Bible today. Jesus told us all of this!!! I guess a secular society needs a secular book.
3,It's not a new Secret,"I haven't finished ready this book yet. But for years I have been reading books about the law of attraction, so this is old news to me. Frankly I find the book boring, which is why I haven't finished it. ""The Law of Attraction: The Basic Teachings of Abraham"" by Esther Hicks is a much better book. ""The Secret"" is a good book for beginners who has not read about the law of attraction."
5,Keeping Positive is the Big Secret!,"Ahh, the Secret, the Secret, the Secret... this is one of the simplest, yet most potentially helpful piece of advice out there but has received more poo pooing than anything I've ever seen! Keeping a positive attitude is the great secret, and once you implement this strategy, you can truly move through your days with ease, positivity and great results."
1,some good ideas embedded in offensive parody of religion,"i admit that i could not get past the foreword because it contains language idolizing this ""secret"" but i gathered from the other reviews that there are some useful ideas in the text"
1,Very poorly written,"I am very thankful I just checked this book out from the library. This book just reitterates common sense. This book talks in circles stating the same thing over and over and over again. Very boring to read, and poorly written. Don't buy this book, it would be a waste of money!"
2,The Secret,I gave this book to seven friends thinking they would all love it. Not one of them even liked it.
3,This is an Outline to get one started,"Obviously this book has received huge attention and is helpful to people. Being familiar with positive thinking and the law of attraction, however, I found this book to be more of an outline. It also helps one find other authors that appeal to them for further reading. There are many more detailed books that are more helpful, from book by Wayne Dyer to Deepak Chopra to Abraham-Hicks and Dr. Norman Vincent Peale. In addition to that, true seekers who want to keep themselves ahead of the curve on staying in this law of attraction zone, continued reading is a must. I also recommend reading about people who have mastered this philosophy in their lives. A recent book that's entertaining and helpful in this regard is about an active modern American centenarian. It's called Elsa's Own Blue Zone and there is also a website by that name to learn more about her. She lives this way daily."
4,Good but not new information,"The Secret is a wonderful book for those who are new to the law of attraction. For the more advanced spiritual student it will be a good review of the process. A good tool to keep you focused on creating what you want. It has been a life changing book for many. I own a retreat center in Sedona, Arizona and have all of our retreat guests watch the movie and the book is available for reference. I do find it a good reference book for those who are beginning their spiritual awakening. Annie Lawrence author of Love's Secret Live Your Life In Love."
5,The Secret in my ears!,"This was all I expected and MORE!! I listen to it in my car for insiration. I also downloaded it to my ipod and I listen to it at work and also when I take my daily fitness walks. Te Secret is always with me! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!"
2,the secret,"It was an ok book. I'm not sure what I was expecting. It basically said what a lot of other self help books have said, just in a different way. Who knows, it might be the way that would make a connection with you. Beginning was a little slow. I found it says the same things over and over again."
3,Not Impressed,"The book is a rehashing of the bible. It is a mirror image of biblical quotes. Granted the messages can be useful and helpful for those who have not had the opportunity to learn how beautiful the bible can be. However, for practicing Christians I urge them to go back to the original genuine article The Bible. It has everything you need including many of the same quotes and messages found in the Secret. There is only one God and He is the one who gives us blessings and mercy."
1,The secret is buy it at Goodwill,"I bought this book at Goodwill for about $3 just to see why it has been a bestseller for so long. Having purused it a couple of times, I'm not really sure. Maybe it's the packaging and marketing. It seems like a bunch of quasi-spiritual quotes from a bunch of nobodys."
2,"The Secret is ""USE YOUR COMMON SENSE!""","What Secret is revealed in THE SECRET? Don't we all know by now that it's better to ""look on the bright side"" of things with the ""glass half full"" and think positive thoughts and good karma? yadayadayada...This book is full of stuff you already know. Save yourself some time and skip reading this old wive's tale. Read something tantalizing like CONFESSIONS OF A CATHOLIC SCHOOLGIRL by Michelle Kane. You get all THE SECRETS!Confessions of a Catholic Schoolgirl"
1,SAME OLD FLUFF REPACKAGED,"Your baby die from drowning? You attracted it. Want to become the next Bill gates? Just wish for it. A tad simplified but not all that much. This is the same old ""as you think so shall you get to consume"" business. Personally, only action, not wishing, ever got me anything. One action I'd take if I could would be to return this waste of money and time. Give us all a break from hucksters."
3,"Okay, but I like this better","I bought this based on all the hype and I have to tell you that I was a little let down-I like the basic premise ""Thoughts help to create your reality"" but I would recommend a book I read while traveling called FREE YOUR MIND by Anthony Stultz-It was a much better guide and gave very clear directions to helping change the way that I allow thoughts to control my moods and behavior."
1,I'm in a quantum quandary,"I don't have this book yet, I really want it. But I guess I don't want it enough yet for it to become mine."
1,Nothing new under the sun.,"This is nothing that wasn't written 3000 years ago in Proverbs. Except that it isn't positive thinking that creates positive results, but that God is in control and always has been.Bottom line, don't waste your time reading this book."
3,"The Secret is OK, but it's not the whole picture...","Susan K, you bring up a very interesting point about the dope who suggested that Jessica Lundsford attracted a child molester into her bedroom. The Secret is really a spiritual truth and only works if what you are believing for in is in accordance with God's will. I am certain that child molestation and disease are not in His will, but health and prosperity are."
1,To much positive thinking...,"I couldn't finish this book. I only bought it because everyone was talking about it being so wonderful. It was a waste of money. Of course good things are going to happen to you sometimes in your life, unless you are just the unluckiest person in the world. All this book was about is positive thinking. I've been thinking positively that I was going to win the Lotto, but I haven't yet. This book is just a load a bologna. Maybe I can sell it on Ebay for a $1."
5,It Works For Me,"I just watched the DVD last night for the first time and have been inspired by it. The inspiration came not from the quality of the DVD or those in the DVD, but from the message contained therein.I am somewhat amazed by many of the reviews that I have read here. For the life of me I cannot find anything negative about The Secret at all.I started applying the power of positive thinking to my life this morning in acknowledging the things that I am grateful for. As I searched my heart and soul for all that I am grateful for I realized that I am truly blessed.At this point I have no desire to ask for anything materialistic but I have no doubt that anything that I do choose to ask for will be received.My interest in The Secret really has nothing to do with outward gain, as there is much more needed inwardly. This realization alone has improved my life already - imagine the potential.................."
3,Don't Regret Reading IT,"Good way to keep your thoughts positive, and to stay focused on what you want, and the possibility to have what you want. Heard about it from a friend, and though the book wasn't what I thought it would be, it was still worth the read."
5,The secret by Rhonda Byrne,Everyone should have a copy of this book it is certainly a life changer. I have bought and given 4 books away and will probably buy a lot more.Excellant book and very up lifting!
5,Life-changing book,"I found this book to be life-changing. I so wish I had read it when I was in high school. What a different world this would be if we started teaching this to our youth! It has become my favorite gift to give to others. What a fast read, too."
1,A waste of time and money,"If the use of the law of attraction was this effective then every professor that taught quantum physics would be driving an expensive Italian sports car to the campus as proof. Your time would be better spent reading a good book that focuses you in a positive realistic direction like ""Who Moved My Cheese"". This is by far the worst book I have bought in years."
2,Seventy-Six Trombones,"Ye gods! This is just Professor Harold Hill's ""Think"" system in book form! Why didn't I think of it? Just goes to show you that Oscar Wilde was right - Life does indeed imitate art, and here we have another fine example of that theory in The Secret. Now every two bit thimble-rigger who takes Ms. Byrne's advice will be making 6+ figures, driving the Merc, and sunning on the Riviera (er, I mean in River City!) Yessir, yessir, yessir, just a bang beat, bell ringing, Big haul, great go, neck or nothin, rip roarin, every time a bull's eye salesman. Hope she knows the territory....."
1,Completely Absurd,"This book has no basis in reality, thinking positive is good, but will not perform miracles. It is dangerous and irresponsible that this book promotes that you can ""think"" your way out of serious illness, I hope no one takes this advice and gets hurt."
5,"""The Secret""- Hope when you need it",You can carry away a ton of hope from this book. My life hasn't always worked so well in the past... but I'm ready to try something new and this is it! There are plenty of good reminders to be grateful for the things in your life that are blessings.
3,self help books,"The Secret is another inspirational self help book. I enjoyed the format,lots of different people giving input. It got a lot of rave reviews from people on zaads, so I was sure it would be a life changing read, but it didn't have a lot of new info and to me, it was not all that impressive. I never did figure out why it was called the secret."
2,more good vibrations,"I agree with some of the reviewers who are balking at new age, self help nonsense. The notion that we exude certain vibrations that attract certain people and things in life as absolutely absurd. Does this mean that people who are alone exude bad vibes? Or poor and fat people, do they also project only fat or poverty vibrations? How about social welfare people do they fire off only welfare atoms at you. You must stay away from those kinds of people or you too will be on the dole."
4,Good - but not as good as the video,"The book was good however, the video was great. The book simply reviews everything that the video explains. If your going to spend your time reviewing the secret, I would recommend buying the video first. It can change your life."
1,not worth it....WAY overrated!,"the ideas presented in this book were disappointing....it's just common sense that people have known for centuries....where do you think we get all the sayings like seeing the glass half full etc. It's always been known that it's better to be positive about things, but this book has made millions of dollars by trying to label this concept with a catchy name. Yes they ""scientifically"" backed it going on and on about wavelengths and thoughts, but i don't buy it. They are ridiculous.the thing that is most annoying though is how everyone goes on and on about how amazing and life changing the book is. I agree that maybe this book has simply presented classic information in a better way than it has been in the past, but it doesn't deserve all the publicity and ""this book is life changing"" stuff."
1,Toilet Paper,"I found this book to be absolutely ridiculous. How can simply envisioning something cause it to come to fruition? Unless luck is on your side, you basically have to go out and make things happen. This book is fantastic for weak minded individuals that are looking for a simple fix to make themselves feel hopeful about their sad situations. Instead of reading this book I highly recommend people use the pages as high priced toilet paper. Then and only then does it serve a real purpose."
2,nothing new,"There is a lot of talk about the ""Secret"" but I really did not think it was ""new"" material. I find it rather interesting that with all the brilliant healers and scientists on this planet, that the people included in this work are only from the U.S..I certainly do not agree that little children or unfortunate people that live in war torn areas ""draw"" this to them. Sounds more like a marketing tool than a message of peace. Where is the compassion for others less fortunate than us?"
1,Brainwashing -misleading,"This book was an insult to my intellegence. It uses broad concepts that are familiar to THE Bible. IE: ask for universe for anything, praise the universe for all good things. It goes on to prophetiZe that you need to throw thoughts out to the universe and they will come back to you. IE: money and all material gains, desires for prosperty and success. It uses visualization. Think money and it will come to you.The whole book (on cd) and including the DVD which is verbatum to the book--various people sitting behind the desk talking at you--is ridiculous,boring and not backed up scientifically.It is a promising for mental midgets--. Never once did it mention God, and yet, it stole all the powers regarding a heavenly being.It elaborated on the universe and its energy forces, void of any spirituality. I stress this because it was so close to spirituality(excluding desires and material gains) but wanted the credit to go to The Secret-which is no secret at all!"
2,As a Man Thinketh for dummies,"I was disappointed with the simplicity it was written. I wanted a deeper thinking, soul searching read. In the seventies I read "" As a Man Thinketh"" by James Allan. It was very thought provoking."
1,Simply Crock,"Lots of other folks say it far better than me but what a crock. C'mon people, there's no free lunch. People don't think themselves sick with cancer or to die in Rwanda or Darfur or Iraq or to starve in Bangladesh or to win the lottery or invent the iPod ... [insert your thought here]. People are successful because they work hard, have a good attitude and, yes, a little luck never hurts. They are not successful simply because they wished it so."
4,Great job,This was a very good book and a must read for anyone who likes the truth and want to understand the world that we live in.
1,Rubbish,"New Age, mumbo-jumbo. No one was to blame for the Holocaust? Get real people. This lady is a modern-day carnival barker selling you a line of bunk. Want real peace and happiness? Read the Holy Bible. No secret there, just God's free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ!"
1,The what?,"I read an article in the paper that reported over one billion people world-wide have read the book, watched the DVD, etc. If that is so, why is it called the ""Secret""? Shouldn't it be called ""That thing that pretty much everyone has heard about""?"
5,Great Book!,"I love everything about this book. It is positive, enlightening and most of all something that everyone can incorporate in their life."
4,The beginning of the new beginning,"I bought this book for my mother who is currently incarcerated. She was at absolute rock bottom, and because of this book she is a changed woman. She is now looking foward to her release (which will be soon, I hope) and has a new ""positive"" outlook on life. This book is for anyone who has ever needed a hug, or just that little kick of motivation. *****!"
2,The Secret,"Ido think that mankind, as a whole, given hard work, ambition, integrity,and senseability, has the potential to accomplish great things. I also think that any man who thinks that he can do these wonderful things alone is very stupid without humility, prayer, kindness, compassion for others, and the grace of God, and His Son Jesus Christ. The Secret lies within our hearts and spirits.His name is Jesus!"
5,Life Changing,"I finished this book in a day. It was impossible to put down. You really have to be open to a completely new frame of thought, but you will notice changes in your life once you apply the teachings. Truly. Life. CHANGING."
2,THE SECRET??,I'M STILL TRYING TO FIND THE POINT OF THIS BOOK. I THINK EACH PERSON HAS TO FIND HIS OWN WAY TO HAPPINESS. WE'RE ALL UNIQUE. WHEN WE SET OUR GOALS IN LIFE AND WORK FOR THEM WE SHOULD BE HAPPY. I CAN'T JUST SIT HERE AND WISH FOR SOMEONE TO COME ALONG AND MAKE ME HAPPY. I GET BORED REAL FAST THINKING ABOUT ME ALL THE TIME.
2,The Secret,"The book was constantly telling you the same thing. Quite Redundant! I got bored with it and didn't finish it completely. I have done the practices illlustrated and nothing yet. I am not skeptical regarding the contents of this book, however, I'm disappointed how I feel about the read."
4,The secret is follow up,This is a very motivational book but takes a little effort on your part not just wishful thinking to make your dreams come true
2,a silly publicity gimmick for an introduction to The Power of Attraction,"This book has been out for many years, so people surely have heard all the pros and cons.I'll cut to the quick of it.The Law of Attraction has been around for a long while. Rhonda Byrne got rich by making up a phoney baloney story that entertained and informed millions and I am happy she did! I'd like to have her booksales! We're all adults here, pretty much and should be over the nonsense by now!She introduced people to a subject done much better by others. and copies are pretty darn cheap by this time.For better reading try the books by the Hicks. especially Ask and It Is Given."
1,Want to know the Secret?,Write and publish a self-help book that promises to others that they can have whatever they want and the money will come flowing to you like a river. How's that for a secret?
1,Dont Waste Your Money,"Here, let me save you some money..... 1. Do good things and good things will happen to you. 2. Pray to god and he will bless you. 3. Be positive and you will succeed.It's called commen sence, Karma, etc etc...Just live your life and be happy. Don't let other people tell you how to be happy and make (themselves) millions while doing it..."
1,Stay away,"Horrible book. Creating self-help books is a business. They are not made to really help you.From the book "" Visualize checks in your mailbox"".??????? If you believe then there is no andto your delusions, and they will make your life miserable."
1,Wanted to return to Costco,"I review with EVERY poor review, so I won't rehash the details. Just wanted to add another *1* to the list. Waste of time, money, and brain cells. And such a shame that Oprah linked her name to it. I didn't always agree with Oprah, but this time I felt betrayed!!"
1,DONT READ THIS,"I love the idea of the secret of the power of the mind but I dont think this book compliments it very well. It instead informercializes this idea of ""wishful thinking."" On the other hand, it did have some good thoughts but the approach they used to get the message across cheapend it."
3,Already been done!,"The book was good but it seemed to be a culmination of many books on the same subject, nothing new.I also found it to be repetitive.Not really worth the price."
4,A REAL EYE OPENER,"This is truly an amazing little book. Once I srarted to read it , could not put it down ! After I had read it, I felt as if there was new life breathed into me . This is not your average self help book, it is much deeper than that.It makes one see more clearly , and gives an understanding of why certain things come into our lives, good or bad. A real eye opener ! I want everyone around me to know "" The Secret ""."
2,The Secret (Audio CD Set) - Rhonda Byrne,"If Ms Byrne only knew how her unprofessional voice and amateur reading style detracts from the powerful messages imparted in this set, she would have it re-recorded by a professional. Good material - poorly presented."
2,Self help book,"I purchased this book on a whim. It didn't teach me anything. The main idea of the whole book is to think positivly, and to visualize what you want. Its nothing new nor earth shattering."
2,Nothing new here...,"I liken this book to the genre of the weightloss money machine. Everyone will buy a book promising them the ""secret"" of losing weight. But, guess what, the book will basically say the same thing every other book says in a fancy dressed up way: Eat less, Move more! Deep down, they already knew it, but someone IMPORTANT is telling them so they'll follow the advice and think wow! This book's great! Same stuff here, someone close to me recommended it and I promised I'd read it. Well, save your money (self-help is a money machine, too) and I'll break it down very simply:1. What goes around comes around (origin, ""don't know"")2. Do unto others as as you'd have done to you (origin, ""Bible?"")3. Think happy thoughts (origin ""Peter Pan"")4. If you build it they will come (origin ""Field of Dreams"")5. Seek and ye shall Find (origin ""Bible?"")6. Ask and ye shall receive (origin ""Bible"")Just live by these 6 phrases, and save your 15 bucks."
1,are you kidding???,"i tried the visualization!!! i envisioned my self in a ferrari with Paris Hilton and i tried so hard it almost came to me but the problem was Paris was in jail :(. so i thought mabey i should really ask, believe, and recive, that didnt work either but it did get Paris out of jail loool.and then when i thought it about deeply i found out the secret is not about me and Paris Hilton, its about the human greet and the overwhelming desire of people trying to control their life and accepting any brian farts(or according to the book ideas) that fullfills this desire of control that we are never gonna have."
1,"No real explanations, so you'll have to take the author's word for it...","I guess some things must remain a secret! A very directive book that alleges to reveal ""the secret"" without explaining how any of these profound ""facts"" were arrived at. The summary sections are the end of each chapter pretty much sum it up!"
3,The Perfect Gift,"This is the perfect gift -- for someone who is gullible and greedy. It sucks you in with it's slicker-than-Madison Avenue-and-Tupperware- combined promotional campaign, its alluring title, and its thrilling promises. Then it shamelessly ""blames the victim"" and panders to your superstitions, prejudices, and desire for an easy path to enlightenment.There is no easy path to enlightenment. There is an easy path to wealth - write a book like this, or one promising easy weight-loss, easy fitness, or easy love relationships. But there is no easy path to any of these. Those who are reading this have the great good fortune to be among the wealthiest 10% of the world's people. After that, it takes more good fortune and a lot of hard work to achieve anything worth achieving. Except, that is, for crooks, snake oil salemen, and authors of books like this.As for enlightenment - live fully in each moment; love everything about that moment; and feel gratitude for each moment."
4,James book club,"This is an excellent book. Some of the parts seemed a little unreal, but the truth is once I used ""the secret"", it did seem to work. If anything, it will help you think more positively about everything. It will help you look at the people and things in your life as a daily blessing."
3,Conflicted,"The optimist in me believes in positive thinking, so the positive implications appeal to me, especially when I'm in a good mood. But the skeptic in me kind of laughed at the idea of paralysis rejuvenation through thought. Don't get me wrong, I believe in the power of the mind, but wouldn't all those paralyzed from the neck or waist down have cured themselves? Furthermore, the realist in me wondered about the authenticity of the messengers. Nevertheless, I think the secret of `The Secret' is positive thinking and internal change and the consequences therein. While I do like the idea of going to sleep and willing my wants and desires in my direction as I rest, I'm yet to see my $1,000,000,000 payday. And yes I know that may be a stretch, but if you're going to dream..."
4,Basic Principle of Life,"Many people possess what this book is selling and really don't realize it. It takes what we know already and pastes it in our face for us to see - really see. The mind is a terrible thing to waste. All things that exist, start out as a thought, whether we are spiritual or not. A very good read."
4,Very Nicely done,"This book is very nicely written, printed and presented. It is colorful and the information is clearly written. I am enjoying it very much."
3,So-so,"The real secret is that Rhonda Byrne has tapped into the human psyche that seeks to find solutions/answers to ensure happiness and fulfillment, and has subsequently become a millionaire. And with an alluring title to boot...It's not that any of the information is wrong, per se, but also nothing surprising, insightful or new. Manifest your destiny. This is the entire message but it fills 200 pages. Continually interspersed with quotations, which makes it a bit cumbersome to read. All that said, not bad if you need a moment of inspiration."
1,Not What I Expected,"This is more like a Cliffs Notes than a book. Some of the information is actually dangerous, like all you have to do is ""think"" yourself thin! I find that chapter completely irresponsible. I wonder how many people are going to die who have Diabetes or other obesity related afflictions which require more drastic action than ""thinking""! A huge disappointment, I am also disappointed in Oprah for featuring it and thus promoting it."
1,Entire book in one sentence.,"What ever you think will come to fruition, so think good thoughts. This is the main point written 10 times every page. You only need a page or two to figure it out, not super enlightening."
3,A beginning...,"Worthy in that it opens one's mind to reach beyond the stuff of life and that our lives are so much better being positive and open. AND we still need to do our own work with our thoughts, beliefs and feelings. Valuable to read and to be inspired. And then follow-up with the life tools of Byron Katie so that whether or not you get those riches, mansions and fame... YOU are happy. The Secret isn't really such a secret but it certainly shows how people WANT to find the ways to live more joyfully and abundantly. Another breadcrumb for the path of learning and growing -- but no quick fix."
1,don't bother,"Although I agree that a positive perspective on things will allow for more positive overall experiences, I don't necessarily agree that if something bad happened in your life, you ""attracted"" it (think of all the abuse, poverty, illness, etc around the globe).The Secret basically says you are your own God. THAT'S SCARY!!!!!No, thanks!Mathhew 6:33""But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.""Seek God's kingdom, not your kingdom."
1,B.S.,Positive thinking isn't going to get you a new car or pay your mortgage. This book and the film assumes that the law of attraction governs all aspects of your life. The philosophies pointed to in this book can be helpfull but to believe you can get something for nothing (which this book promises) can be a huge set back. You want a new car or to pay your mortgage? Work hard.
1,Not worth the paper it is written on.,"The book is premised on the law of attraction. The theory is that if you think positive thoughts that good things will come to you, and if you think negative thoughts that bad things will come to you. In practice, the theory tells me that this book was horrible, because i was thinking it was horrible after the first 15 pages. So it is my fault the book was bad:)This book boils down to something we all have been told before...It helps to have a positive attitude in life. If you need to be told that again and again and again, then read this book."
2,Where's the Beef?,"I have to ask, who hasn't heard all this before? Not only is the book repetitive and difficult to read -- it's also full of stuff that's been written by everyone from Napoleon Hill to Tony Robbins. Some ""secret.""Still, the power of positive thinking always bears repeating. But if you are looking for a way to make changes in your life, check out Jennifer Louden's ""The Life Organizer."" It shows how to create the life you love not through ""magic,"" but by making it happen yourself, digging into the deepest parts of your heart to figure out what it is that you really DO want."
1,Shrug,"Frankly, I expected something more astonishing, considering the excitement this book generated. Like attracts like. The Druids knew this; Wicca and the earth-based, Celtic forms of Paganism have never forgotten it. Hardly a ""Secret""."
2,the secret,"the best i can say so far about this book that it is very prettitly packaged, each page says the same thing, it could all be wrapped up in two paragraphs"
5,A book that opened my eyes...,"I have studied many different fields of ""metaphysical"" thinking over the years. Everything from Buddhist to Thelema and Hermetic Traditions.This simple, small, unassuming book opened my eyes to the Universe in ways I never imagined. Stripped of the cumbersome ritual, uncertainty, insecurity and teacher/personality worship I have found so discouraging in my other studies, this book stripped bear the SIMPLICTY of the underlying ""law"" of the Universe.I have had many insights into my faith and experienced a harmonizing effect in the sense that I can now look back over my previous studies and fully, honesty UNDERSTAND!Give this little book a chance."
3,"Not Bad, Read ""Think and Grow Rich"" Much Better","A much more practical book is a classic on the subconscious ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napoleon Hill an in depth step by step guide without the hollywood background , you can save money and get it at your library for free...."
4,The Secret is...,"Write a book called The Secret and make millions! The book might as well be written in crayon, it's not philosophical or based on any factual evidence. However, if you are a pessimistic person who always blames others for your lack of success then reading this book could give you a new perspective. It's a no lose situation, if you have a positive attitude good things will come to you. It as simply as smiling more. Those who smile get better service and are reward more often. How you present yourself is how you are perceive. Sometimes we all need to be reminded that we reap what we sow, and this book does exactly that."
3,The Secret,"The author restates what has been in literature for a long time--The power of thinking. I am concerned that people will develop guilt when ""all good things"" do not happen to them and will fault themselves. Reality is that bad things happen to all people. There is not enough emphasis in the book on the actions that need to accompany the thinking. Also, as a reader of Scripture, I found much of the information both complementary to scripture and contradictory to scripture. Therefore, as with all books, this book needs to be read with much discernment."
1,The book of illusion,"The worst book on personal development I have ever read. (being a coach and reading 80 books a year, winning the prize as the worst book was not easy).The metaphorical message of the book is right: change your thinking and you change your life, embracing the future you want. But the author goes way beyond that, declaring that the universe will conspire with your positive thoughts and make things happen for you. She even tells you that if you are receiving bills to pay, it's because of your negative thinking: think positive, and you will start receiving cheques!! (well, that's convenient!!)so, although the principe is right, the book goes way too far, thus deluding people into thinking that just thinking hard about something will bring change. thought without action is just philosophical debate: actions in accordance to our thinking is what shapes our future. No matter how you pray, at the end of the month you will receive your elecricity bills!"
3,"Powerful book for inspiration, but no success guaranteed!","I love the when Byrne wrote the book by quoting famous's speech and citing successful people. I also enjoy the feeling of hope that was given to me from reading the book. However, there is no guarantee that after following the teaching of the book precisely, you will be given things you desire.Over all, the book is a good tool to make you more optimistic about life, but not something that you have to hold on deary."
5,It's your choice...,"The Secret does an excellent job focusing the events in our lives as a direct reflection of our attitude and energy. It is a powerful example of our ability to control our destiny thru our actions and reactions. In the end, it's our choice how we transmit our lives.Great book!"
1,the secret,"THIS IS FOR SURE A SELF-HELP BOOK, BUT STILL A DIFFERENT KIND OF IDEA ON THE SUBJECT OF THE SECRET. I STILL DON'T GET IT TO BE HONEST WHAT IS THE SECRET BUT POSITIVE THINKING AND IN SOME WAYS WISH FULL THINKING.I DID NOT KNOW THAT THIS WAS SUCH A BIG BIG SECRET.IN MY OPINION NOTHING COMES TO YOU WITHOUT HARD WORK, EDUCATION, AND MONEY.SO MAYBE NEXT TIME CALL THE BOOK.... FOOL YOURSELF TO THINK THAT YOU ARE GOING TO GET RICH SECRET...."
1,Snake Oil 2007,If I could give this heap of rubbish ZERO stars I would. This is opportunism at it's worst. Nothing more. I'm not going to repeat ad nauseum all the other negative things already said about this book and the accompanying DVD. Stay up late one night and watch Infomercials and save yourself the cost of this garbage.
1,A secret nobody wants to hear.,"This is possibly the worst book ever bound, ever. The idea behind it is good but its execution is terrible. Positive thinking generates a greater chance of success in your life; no problem there. But to claim that desire without work or making plans to reach your goals is not only foolish, it is also a dangerous thought system. Just another cheesy self-help book that throws responsibility to the wind and promotes a seemingly lazy faith in the world around you. The most amusing thing of all, however, is when one of the speaker in the DVD format of this book claims that you ""can get something out of nothing!"" Looks like someone needs to take another physics class or at least a critical thinking course."
4,Life Changing Information.,"If you can apply just 10% of the attitude and philosophy of this book, to your own life, it would change everything and everyone around you for the better for-ever!"
3,Said Before in Many Ways,"The marketing on this book is so blatently not hidden I commend the author. At least the hypocrisy goes only so far. The content has been said in many other books through the century. There is a discrepency in my opinion when they focus on materialism and wealth. There are positives in most all books. The Secret also has some positive aspects, however the fluff and simplicity sugars down the practicality.Too many hurting souls will bury their heart into this book, only to find that getting through life crisis is not as simple as rubbing the cover of this book as a magic lamp.Dan Williams author of "" Above His Shoulders"""
4,"Not like the two previous ones, but ingenious none the less.","There are only three song on this one that I do not like: State Fair, Antique High Heeled Red Doll Shoes and Cooped, for some reason those songs just really grated on my nerves. Other than that however, I thought that the songs of this album were really great. Although a lot of the other veiwers did not care for Remnants of Percy Bass, I felt that it was a really beautiful. I do understand peoples' dislike for this song though, because the sound of the dulcimer is very unusual. The dulcimer is a very ancient musical instrument, most people aren't even familiar with it's sound unless they have heard Asian music which is why the dulcimer can really take some getting used to for the ears of many westerners."
5,Cabin Fever,"I really enjoy this CD. The music is light, and makes me feel better when I'm sad or angry."
4,Thalia With A Twist,"This is a very interesting album, ALTHOUGH Thalia's style is not ""Grupera"" so it's kind of weird to listen to her hits in a different genre. If she was to release a Greatest Hits Album with a twist, she shoul've released her hits in the Remixed versions which are Excellent. It's NOT a bad album, but it's just not her, she is the Queen of Latin Pop, not Grupera. But give it a try, hopefully we will get used to her new experiment, and since everything she touches is Gold, there's not doubt this album will become big!"
4,Beautiful color set! Delightful actors!,"I love this book very much and it's wonderful to see it on screen. This movie had a WONDERFUL cast! While I like the Winona Ryder version better than this version, I found the movie to be very endearing. I love Margaret O'brien. I know she was cast as Beth b/c of her tremendous ability to cry. I found Elizabeth Taylor to be terribly miscast. There is no way she could be younger than Margaret O'brien. I initially thought Margaret O'brien was Amy as she was obviously the youngest person in the cast. I had guessed perhaps Liz Taylor was MEG. It had a hard time believing the lovely Liz as a blond, first of all and while she had the vain part down pat, she did not have Amy's vulnerability. Kirsten Dunst played Amy to perfection!!Over all, it was fun to see such huge stars in a movie together during their heyday! It's a fun watch."
2,Not bad... but,"I love the cast. June Allyson is perfect Jo and Magaret O'brien is simply touching. But unlike the cast, the movie is not that believable. I agree with Maltin. It is too grossy! MGM art team made the March family another Rockefellers! They didn't read the book. I'm sure."
1,Boring :(,"I loved the book, I loved the Hepburn version, liked the Ryder version, but this...it just bored the tar out of me! It did match the book fairly well, but it dragged on so much that I fought to stay awake through most of it! Rent it first if you must, don't waste your money."
5,Little Women at its best,"I have seen both the 1994 Winona Ryder and this 1949 version of ""Little Women"". I have not read the book so I can't vouch for its accuracy. The acting in both versions are excellent and so were the movie. However what makes the 1949 version better is its presentation. Mind you, this is 1949 and the sets and color, Technicolor, are outstanding. Watching the movie is like going back into the Currier and Ives world. Movies were supposed to be an escape for about 2 hours and this movie delivered. Curl up into your easy chair, especially on a cold winter evening with the fireplace burning. They don't make movies like this anymore. Your won't be dissapointed."
5,GREAT FOR YOURSELF OR FOR A GIFT,"I love this book! Kathleen King, the author and owner of the Tate Bakery, has been a guest on Ina Garten's cooking show, ""Barefoot Contessa,"" where viewers also had a glimpse inside the bakery. The recipes cover a nice range of desserts, and all of them are written for the home bakery -- easy to read and delicious to eat! I have thoroughly enjoyed having my copy, and I think others would as well.For some reason, I feel that this cookbook would make an ideal gift for anyone who enjoys baking and might appreciate having a few new recipes. I think it may be because of the book's style. So many bakery cookbooks are written for people who already know how to decorate a wedding cake! This book, though offering recipes of all ranges, includes recipes for all of us to use, whether we're experienced or not, and that makes an ideal gift.Grab your copy of this book before it goes out of print! You won't be sorry."
1,disappointed,Used the perfume oil for years....thought spray would bea nice change. Use Rain and the spray does not have the samesent. Do not like it at all.
3,A good read and a useful guide,"We know Sanibel well, we have enjoyed the island and plan to return at least annually. The Doc Ford novels have given an added dimension to our enjoyment, delineating the spirit of place in a way which is important to us. We have also learned from each of these books a lot about the natural history of Sanibel, a sort of value-added dividend, and we will return determined to pay more attention to these deeper aspects of what has become much more to us than just a nice place. These books are thus highly and topically informative, and fun to read as well. Biking around the island with a Doc Ford in our topbag is our kind of vacation.The restaurant is pretty nice, too.Shark River (Doc Ford)"
3,Somewhat of a disappointment,"To start, I am a huge fan of Randy Wayne White and his Doc Ford books. For me, each new novel is eagerly anticipated. However, I was disappointed by Shark River. I can't remmber being disappointed by a new Doc Ford book since The Man Who Invented Florida. At some points, I felt that pages were missing as there was not as much character or plot development as previous novels. It seemed as if there was a deadline to meet becuase the whole thing came to a conclusion in a few pages with little suspense. Nevertheless, I will look forward to the next Doc Ford novel that will hopefully be up to the standard of Sanibel Flats or Captiva."
2,Tough getting into,For whatever reason I just couldn't get into the story but that doesnt mean you wont. I will probably try again.
1,UGH!!,"I made absolutely sure that this would be compatible with macintosh before I bought it for my daughter this Christmas. I figured I'd have to do a few conversions here and there but nothing major. Well, it's the day after Christmas and I still can get it to play anything other than the Mix Max video clip I bought for it, and a couple of Disney Podcasts I downloaded via iTunes. Not even my daughter's disney cds will play properly after we uploaded them to iTunes and then downloaded them to the Mix Max. If my 18 y-o son tech guru of a son can't even figure this out, I'm guessing this is a major problem.The manual that came with the MixMax is worthless, as is the support PDF I downloaded from Memorex (who makes Mix Max). It might be helpful for those of you with Windows, but they offer no online support for mac.I'm in a major snit right now and not very happy about this expensive purchase!"
4,Great architectural overview of the nation's capital city.,"This AIA guide to Washington, DC is a great resource for those interested in learning a little about the many interesting buildings in the nation's capital. It is concise enough to add more interest and depth to a tourist's visit to DC and comprehensive enough to offer enough information to keep an amateur architecture enthusiast informed about DC's architecture. As a student of classical architecture in the nation's capital, I used this book to provide me with some fundamental, perfunctory background about the monuments, federal buildings, and privately-owned buildings of the city. It has served me well and I have no doubt that it will provide most with a more than adequate introduction to the finer points of this nation's city."
4,Nice Change of pace,"I really enjoyed this CD, it was a nice change of pace, it felt more mellow than what I've recently listened to.It did become a bit repetative sounding, and not as innovative as I first thought, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. Overall I would recommend this."
3,"Not bad, not great either...","So this is a comedy skit album and really, for as funny as I have heard Dan be, this cd does have it's moments, but is not nearly as funny as I was expecting it to be. The skits are well written, funny premises, but really not executed as well as they probably could have been.I guess I was expecting something more chock full of jokes, but really it is a little more laid back, funny stories and situations kind of humor, which I do like most of the time.I do not have much to say on this, but if you are a hardcore Simpsons fan, then you will want it for the track that Dan does as Homer that is rather funny, but if you are just a fan of comedy albums, this is not the best."
2,A very poor textbook,"As many other reviews said, if you are using this as a textbook for a class where you are just learning the material, this book is useless. If you already know the material, well, you won't need it then either because you probably already have more useful books in your library. The homework problems tend to be long and difficult, but generally instructive.It is a very cheaply bound paperback book. My lightly used copy is already starting to fall apart. Any teacher asking a student to spend $120 for this book is being really irresponsible. If it is required for a class you are taking, you will be better off photocopying the pages with homework problems."
4,Good except for its coverage of mathematical induction,"The discrete math course at our university is a sort of ""rite of passage"" for math majors- it introduces students to the idea of proofs, as well as basic set and graph theory and combinatorics. It is an introduction to the abstract aspect of mathematics. This book serves this purpose well, with a number of examples and drawings to illustrate concepts. However, this book explained induction in a manner that confused me. Also, our department wasn't too fond of this book- they switched to another after one semester. Still, I don't think it's too bad- unless the current book that the department uses is that much better."
3,Tonight At Noon- Charlie Mingus Big Band,"I wish I would have listened to the music samples of this CDfirst. I agree these musicians on this CD are very good, butI love big swinging jazz bands like Herman, Basie, Kenton, Fedchoke, etc. ect.ect. The Mingus Big Band sounded more classical to me. I believe when you play jazz music you should play strictly jazz music and not a classical sound in my humble opinion. If you want play classical music you should join a symphony orchestra and don't mix with jazz music."
3,a very very long story,"At first it was interesting, but then the story goes on and on and it seems it would never reach the end (I find it way longer than Final Fantasy's series stories). There's almost no high-CG sequences (around 3-4 including the opening). The end was kinda cheesy. I would suggest to wait for a price drop before buying it. ""Final Fantasy"" series are still better than this one."
3,I miss the Extra Width/Orange days - an IM conversation,"<friend>: I assume you have that new jsbx record. any good?<me>: I don't like the new jsbx.<fsn>: ha ha.<me>: I had high hopes with all the talk of ""returning to their roots"" and such.<friend>: what the heck is wrong with it?<me>: I've been trying to figure out how to explain it without it sounding stupid, but the bottom line is that the songs are all too well-written _songs_. Too rigid maybe? It's just not loose and experimental and punk like the early stuff.<friend>: this would be my fave jsbx album by far is what you're saying.<friend>: that's your review:<friend>: ""<Friend's name> would dig this."" yes?<me>: I don't even know. It's an interesting theoretical...<friend>: although I do like ""experimental"" and ""punk"" in general.<me>: Exactly.<me>: It's just too not noisy.<friend>: interesting.<me>: Restrained, maybe?<me>: Plain?<me>: No static. No feedback."
4,Here's hoping for an Xtra-Plastic Fang,"Damn those Japanese imports... JSBX saves some of their beststuff for overseas. ""Ghetto Mom"" deserves to be on the domesticversion but, alas, you must shell out $ to get it on this. Theother ""import"" tracks are OK, and are just as good as whats on the U.S. release.I wish they'd put the BEST tracks on the album and save thethrowaway cuts for b-sides and imports."
1,Phantom gift set,This sounds delicious. It would be nice if I had actually received it. Someone on my list went without a Christmas present & I still don't have a refund. SportsKids claims that these folks shipped my sauce set to someone across the country according to Amazon. This set gets shipped third party. Maybe I'm the first person to write a review because no one has actually seen this set of sauces.
5,The best you can find,"I have been teaching English for the past seven years, and anything that these two authors write is better than anything out there. I have taught a variety of levels of a variety of students, and this works the best. Any teacher who knows what they're doing will try to use either this book or Expressways as often as possible."
5,BEST ESL/EFL supplement workbook,"I have been teaching English to Japanese and Korean students for four years. Out of all of the workbooks that I've used, Side by Side is the best at getting shy students to engage in conversation. Someone mentioned that the fashions are a little bit outdated; however, none of my students have had a problem with this and letting students have fun is key. The illustrations are amusing and fun to look at and talk about! This book can be used in so many different ways. Sometimes I will copy the illustrations and put them on a poster or on flash cards. I am DEFINATELY not an artist and these pictures really help. Give this series a try! They are great!"
3,Only get the book if you are a new person to the show!,I think you should only get this book if you have not been watching the show since the start of it. A hard core fan would know all of the stuff that is in it. There are not alot of pictures and the pictures that are there are all in b/w.
2,A light book about a heavy show,As a big fan of the show I expected a lot more from the book. It offers very little about Peta Wilson herself other than a scant look at her life and career that was available in most magazine articles (the book is un-authorized). And the synopsis of the series is pretty basic. Half of the tome is taken up with a lot of silliness that is more for kids than adults.There are also very few pictures. It was great to find ANY book on my favorite TV show but I had hoped for a lot better than this....fun but generally to light for me.
1,Awful!,"First I should disclose that I didn't finish this book. I got about halfway through before I couldn't take it anymore. I love BDSM erotica, and I often enjoy stories with non-consensual things such as this one--kidnapping and such. So prudishness is not the reason I disliked this book. It was just terrible...not erotic or sexy to me at all. There is no erotic energy between Deborah and any of the men, and they weren't interesting or sexy characters at all. The dialogue basically consists of ""On your knees bitch"", ""Suck it bitch"", ""I'm gonna put you in a cage bitch"". Seriously, it was that bad. I wouldn't recommend this, it's just not hot at all!"
2,Where's The Mission's performance ????,"I believe the UK version of this DVD has a performance by the goth-rock band The Mission. It it not included in the U.S/CANADA release. Are we not fans also? Christ! What a rip off! I will pass, thanks!Now the DVD producer looses my money and its their own fault. Ha-Ha!"
2,Quick & Simple Irish needs a book!,"My problem with this is that I am a visual learner and I really would have been helped by some accompanying written material. I have absolutely NO background in Irish so this was very confusing. (I do have a slight knowledge of French and found the Pimsleur French just fine.) So, for me, this was neither quick nor simple. I'm going to try a different system, something with a book!"
4,"Basic...but ""nice""","I bought the ""Quick & Simple Irish"" from Apple iTunes (it's $12.95 for the download!) after reading about it here. Firstly, I agree with the person that mentioned the man and the woman pronounce ""Gaelige"" differently. It was confusing at first. However, having studied Ulster Irish for almost 3 years, I usually fill in the blanks (so to speak) with the word/words the way they ""should"" sound. Nevertheless, even with the dialect shifts, it's no too bad.According to the Pimsleur website, the 8-Hour Q&S; is 25% of the Comprehensive...and 50% of the Conversational levels. So, it's worth the money. Its flaw is that in the Pimsleur world, it is rather limited, since other languages are offered in the higher levels (30-90 lessons).Areas to improve: re-create the course in Ulster Irish, offer the higher levels (more than just the Q&S;), and have the speakers agree on ONE pronunciation."
5,A foundation for the study of the language,"I love this series. It is by no means a comprehensive coverage of the language and the recordings are made by natives with a southern Irish dialect, but I've found it to be a great starting place for a more intensive study. People all learn differently. It's been great for me to get the sound of Irish in my mind before beginning the book learning of grammer and vocabulary. I am fortunate to have a fluent teacher that I meet with every couple of weeks and he is very impressed with my pronunciation. I attribute that to studying with this series."
1,P-U!!!!,I am very disappointed with this effort. The whole album is a bore. I actually fell asleep during the last few minutes. Don't waste your money on this trash.
2,You will shelve this record after one listen,"Three first songs are good, the single beautiful Day kind of reminds you of Radiohead. But the rest of this is like a whole different band. Boring riffs, fast but aimless tunes that are not quite punk, not quite power pop, not quite anything. Most forgettable record I've heard in a long time, can't wait for the new Suede record."
3,Good tunes...but misleading sound compared to the rest,"I bought the CD (revolt) thinking the entire CD would be about the same pace as ""Beautiful Day"", not even close. A completely different sound than what I would of expected.It's good, just not what I had in mind."
1,Disappointing Schmidt book,"Growing up the 1970's I was a fan of many of the National League stars, including Mike Schmidt. I was an admirer of his prolific hitting and his hard work at becoming a stellar fielding third baseman.With this said, this is one of the worst baseball autobiographies that I have ever read. As a matter of fact, this is one of the worst autobiographies of ANYONE that I have ever read. Self-serving and monotonous, this book belongs in the same class as Canseco's steroids tome. Another vapid book about an ex-major leaguer. Don't waste your money - wait until it makes it to your local dollar store."
1,Inaction figure,It fell apart almost right out of the box. My child couldn't play with it at all. He is not a rough kid either. It simply was not meant to be handled.
3,3 stars...it's ok.,"so first off, it comes with 7. you might feel lucky - but there's a reason why it comes with 7. it's because this isn't an easy task. they give you 7 because they expect you to make mistakes. my first one was a disaster. it had lines all over and so i tore it off and tried a second one. it looked better but not perfect. i don't want to do it again because i'm scared i might break my iPod by continually heating it.it's ok though. i can't say it sucks. it does the job. it covers ur ipod and keeps it from scratches. it just looks less than perfect. i'm into perfect looking things.so what does it look like? well, u know how some toys come with batteries. there's this plastic wrap around it...that's exactly what this is. again, not bad...but not easy to pull of either."
4,Tearin' up my heart.,"I am not a N'Sync fan I would rather listern to the Backstreet Boys, but I do like this cd. Much better then any of thier other efforts"
3,Zircon MultiScanner i700 OneStep,"Not that bad of a scanner.........was a little disappointed regarding scanning of pipes and a/c wires. but for the price I paid ($19.95) its ok.Is good for a weekend person, but not the greatest for a contractor."
2,"NOT ACCURATE , BAD DESIGN","THE SCANNER SHOWED STUDS BEHIND THE WOODEN BOARDS BUT INFACT THERE WAS NOTHING.ALSO IT WAS NOT EASY TO HOLD THE SCANNER WHILE PRESSING AND SWEEPING ON THE CEILING,NOT A GOOD DESIGN"
4,It's pretty good.,I'm only writing this review because I don't agree with the most recent.Most Pedro the Lion fans I know say Control is their favorite. It's a great one to start with.
4,fantastical,"As i read through the reveiws, I see a lot of people that are dissapointed in 'control.' Personally I like it, my favorite song right now is ""second best"" track 8. I couldn't believe that nobody else even mentioned this song earlier."
5,Real People - Real Places,"A breath of fresh air. Plots and sub-plots. People and their strengths and frailities. Real people. The kind of project in its fifth year that could go on forever. I (and my wife) have seen the first four years twice. It grows and changes just like the characters and their relationships. Blood is thicker than water. Love grows. And love and involvements are presented in a natural manner that gives it a PG rating if such were to be applied. After our second trip around we watched Pride and Prejudice (BBC Version) and also the US Version from 1940. The British have a way of telling their stories differently. And delightfully. Enjoy and buy the whole series on DVD when released. The characters only get better. I would consider it an honor to be a part of a series such as this. Taste, I believe is the word to apply. And honesty and integrity."
5,EXCELLENT!,"A wonderfully practical and well-integrated book of great Tomie dePaola activities. May be used with many grades, and easily extended or adapted for kids of all ability levels. A MUST for every elementary teacher!"
4,"Joe, Roy and Hank's ghost","Obviously, both men were having fun. There is a pleasant give and take between them with Joe playing the more complex improvisations. Roy is having a ball, rolling like thunder on the melodies. Plus their fine musicianship, the material played is interesting. These guys take the Hank Williams song book and put there personal signature on Hank's great oldies."
3,"Rock and Roll in Milwaukee, ena?","The compilation is excellent for the most part; however it is missing important background info, mis-identified players' instruments, and has at least one mis-spelling of a band member's last name which is inexcusable. The author should have done more research."
3,Disappointing,"Personally, I was quite disappointed with this one. I have all three Mushroom Jazz CDs, the Mixer compiliation, and SF Sessions 1, and I would recommend all them before this one. Connect is just too inconsistent to enjoy. The first couple tracks are boring, but things pick up with Future Signs by Swirl People. Things go smoothly until track 11 and the compilation begins falter. Then there is Mark Farina's Radio, which just [stinks]. It gets better afterwards, but the sore spots of this album kept me from fully appreciating it, and I find it hard to recommend buying unless you really like Mark Farina or don't mind boring Latin songs getting in the way of what could have been a tight compiliation."
4,Mark and Naked Music Stay In My CD Player(s),"Another flawless disc by Mark Farina. I can not get enough of Mark just like I can not get enough of Miguel Migs (Naked Music). This is a must have cd. Now I'm not saying that Mark Farina ""sounds"" like the artists from the Naked Music label, I'm just saying that when my body needs a vibration these are the artists that I listen to. To all TRUE fans of House/R&B, BUY THIS CD! You will not be disappointed."
2,Clinical and gushy,"Poorly argued polemic tarted up as serious thought written in gushy, self concious, psuedo-poetic prose. Many of the descriptions, meant to be courageously bold, are simply embarassingly clinical."
1,Yuck,"It shouldn't take anyone terribly long to figure out why the New York Times has given this book not one but two rave reviews: the author is one of the paper's star reporters. And it's well known that the Times killed a bad review of the book, saying that it wasn't ""fair"". But what about being fair to us readers? Bad reviews of the book abound in the British and science press, and they are well deserved. This book is self serving and half baked--the author never misses an opportunity to brag about how strong she is, or what a good mother she is, or how she dated an Olympic swimmer in college. And the writing is just plain embarassing. But what really grates is Angier's paranoia--she swings wildly and fiercely at everything and everyone from Fred Lebow (former president of the New York Road Runner's Club who, Angier gloats, died of a brain tumor before he could irritate her further) to suitcases with wheels (which she considers whimpy). What's with this woman?"
1,Not worth the time,"I would hope that this book is a joke. I have never read something that does so little for women. We do not have to worry about men giving women a bad name, this book does it just fine. This book is mostly written in a crude and vulgar tone that will turn off most readers. For example, the author refers to a whale penis as a ""ten foot rod,"" and made a comment that states that women should be asexual and procreate by themselves. So much for gender equality! We are going backwards here."
1,"Why Don't you Re-name it, Woman: Feminist Whore?",Completely asinine. I was severely disappointed and dismayed at Angier's depiction of women. It is full of contradictory and faulty evolutionary biology. Narrow minded and crass. I literally took this book outside and burned it half way through reading it.
1,Am I missing something?,"I would think this book ironic, if I believed the author were capable of irony, but she clearly is not. Given that I have no scientific credentials, I cannot comment on the book's scientific credibility, but as a professor of English literature, I can say that the book is so poorly argued that it had no credibility for me. As well, it is written in an over the top style one associates with eager freshmen, not seasoned journalists. One hopes this author will return to straight forward reporting on science, and redirect her ""poetic"" impulses to late night scribblings in a personal journal."
3,"Been there, done that. A socio-physiological romp.",This book is like a Salvation Army soup kitchen: they'll feed you but first you have to hear the sermon. Despite the incredibly skilled and funny phrasings and some fairly decent physiology this is a feminist tract. I think that the author wishes women were parthenogenic at will. This book falls in the cracks: it is not a useful reference because the 245 citings are not traditionally bibliographed and it is too wordy to be a good read for the beach. It is impossible to reverse engineer a reference to find where it is cited. Despite the number of references Ms. Angier relies almost exclusively on the published (and unpublished) work of a few female researchers. Read it for fun and knowledge but sell it at the end of the semester.
5,Mellow and Rockin,"If there was a way to have the best of both worlds, this would be the soundtrack. It's like, you can listen to it on the way to the party, and on the way home in the morning when you have a hangover. It's that good."
5,just brilliant,"i am a huge fan of mark linkus' sparklehorse: his melodies, his innovative use of toys like optigans, casios, violins and cellos. the cracked, cubist lyrics. he's poetry. ""good morning spider"" was immensely poignant, but ""it's a wonderful life"" is a masterwork. if i hadn't bought new order's new thing and the black watch's ""lime green girl"" this week as well, i'd say this is the record of the year. it's amazing: there really is so much good music out there; but you have to dig for it. here's hoping this band finds a big (but not TOO) audience."
3,"Not what I expected, but still good","This is a CD by the BRITISH (Australian?) Hi5. NOT the American group. The error might be mine, but I do think this should be more clearly stated in the product description.After the shock wore off, my daughter loves it. The songs are really easy to sing to."
1,Poor quality and fishy return policy,"The bargain was too good to be true. The shawl was very lightweight, and the silk was poor quality. It actually gave me a slight rash (and I don't have sensitive skin). One thing to note if you decide to order from this company is the return policy. When I returned the package, I sent a copy of the confirmation of delivery from the post office to show that I had received the product less than 10 days before. They refunded the full value, but said this was an exception because their policy is that the return has to happen within 10 days of shipment, not receipt. I didn't even get the package within 10 days of shipment."
1,Pointless,"(1.) This movie starts out poorly by self promoting for 10 minutes other movies with no skip/ff option. (2.) About a third of the movie is low budget staring at the screen shots & dialogue - boring. (3.) Another third of the movie is a C grade disjointed rip off of B grade Mexican spaghetti action scenes - lots of fire pots; very fake shoot outs; pursuit & crash; thieves stealing from thieves. (4.) Can''t Indian movies present, for the most part, females in roles other than smiley, head & hair turn, vulnerable sex toys? (5.) Thank you, fast forwarding."
2,"Good plug, bad price","It's a good standard copper plug, used in tons of applications. What's not good is the price. Caveat emptor: this plug is available from any and every Autozone for two bucks. Shame on me for purchasing here instead of just going to the local parts store. These plugs are available pretty much EVERYWHERE.Happy days..."
3,A Tristeza jam.,"Sounds like someone recorded Tristeza jamming in their practice space. The songs are drawn-out and meandering, and don't have the structure and changes found on the full-length albums. That said, this is an interesting addition if you love their other stuff."
5,Absolutely stunning clock!,"This is a beautiful time piece and looks better after it's hung on the wall. The fine woodwork and craftmanship that was put in to this clock makes this a fine addition to my home. The atomic function of the clock works just like it was designed. I put the battery in it and that's it. It took nearly six hours to adjust to the accurate time, but it's designed to receive the radio signal overnight or when you have the best reception . I highly recommend this clock. It is more than I expected."
2,Saturday the 14th Strikes Back,"Unfortunately, this movie was not as good as it's predecessor. Then again how many sequels really are? The movie was kind of bland with a boring story line. It produced a few decent laughs, but not really much more. A few good actors kind of kept this movie going, but there was only so much they could do to try to save this film. Personnaly, I would rate a low-budget movie much higher than this film."
4,"great band, great album","I have a tendency to compare them to Indigo Girls. The lyrics arent quite as profound or poetic, and they can overdue the harmony thing at times, but the songs are enjoyable the CD is in my top50 or so."
2,Horrendous sound quality and production!,"Tough love from a major Waterboys fan: Will someone please steal the master tapes, pro-tools, etc. of this CD from Mike Scott and remix it! It is harshly distorted--musically and vocally, which ruins the bulk of the songs. Whoever introduced Mike Scott to singing through a micro-synth should get the death penalty. And the pronounced Irish affectations in his voice have reached their preposterous zenith. Half the songs on here would be decent if they were stripped down to basics and cut shorter by 3 minutes (not every coda is worthy of Hey Jude treatment). If you are a new fan, stick with Mike Scott's Still Burning and the Waterboy's first 4 CD's. This is for aural masochists only!"
4,very interesting,"I thouroughly enjoyed this book. I have read a great many of slams books and greatly enjoyed his writing style. I also am very familiar with the other people in the book Hackworth,Westmoreland,truscott,etc.thats why i was so interested in it but aside from that, it is a great story of an american family torn apart by Vietnam as many families were.Really enjoyed learning all the history of slam as well."
3,The Muffs or The Beards?,"Now as a dedicated Muffs fan, i feel slightly let down by this 'lacklustre' performance by The Beards.Essentialy where the Beards fail is where the Muffs triumph. Now in my previous attempt at reviewing a Muffs album, I gave it a worthable 3 and i said to myself I would try and get off from sitting on the fence.....but i find it rather too comfortable which leaves me no option but to give this record the 3 star treatment.It has one or two high points with the accordion and banjo solo that lasts for an impressive 3 minutes. But perhaps the lowest point has to be the bonus track at the end of the LP...after a good 40 minute album, the last thing you want to hear is an alarm clock sound going off. Although that may have been my alarm clock, as i fell asleep listening to the album with the timer on...hmmOverall, the jury is out yet again...and this trial will resume on monday.John kiltp.s. Rodney Dubbing says the record is merely 'bland, weak....but excellent (3/5)'"
3,"Remember, three stars is ""good"".","The first twelve minutes of ""Poland"" is some of best music the classic ""threesome"" TD ever did. It's a rouseing military-parade type march that just keeps builiding until it just explodes. Great! It's sporatic from there on. ""Barbakane"" meanders for the first two thirds of it's duration until turning into an engaging, seemingly blatant re-arranged instrumental version of The Fifth Demention's ""Beautiful Balloon"". ""Tangent"" is equally uneven. ( If you listen closely you'll hear a re-mixed ""Chrononzon"" from ""Exit"" thrown in.) ""Horizon"" is probably the best piece from start to finish, ending with a hyper-pulsateing, multi-synthi orgasm. It's not as focused or taught as ""Logos"", their definitive live masterwork, but it's got enough of the good stuff to check out."
2,Like a cookbook without the recipes....,"Dear Jane is a complation of the two hundred and twenty five blocks from Jane A Stickle quilt. If you are a pro quilter you will probably be able look at these drawings and figure out what goes where. For the rest of us, who require directions, you will probably wish Papadakis was a bit more thorough.Its fine to identify the blocks. I could probably do that given the time. But a drawing and the block name does not constitute a 'pattern.' It might be more accurate to say this book has pictures of each block with a diagram but no instructions.Overall, I expected more. The Jane Stickle quilt is a masterpiece but this book was useless unless you just want to identify the blocks she made."
1,Even worse than Blair Witch.,"After the utter letdown of Blair Witch, I purchased this movie thinking it would do what BWP promised, but never delivered. Once again, disappointment. The video was boring, repetitious, and the ending was so bad, I can't believe it. Looking through the other reviews, I just can't imagine what anyone considered scary, or even creative. What a letdown."
1,EXTREMELY BORING,"I did not see TBWP. If it is anything at all like Broadcast, I have no desire to see it whatsoever. I waited and waited for something to happen, but nothing ever did. That only made the movie seem like it was 6 hours long. It was very, very, very boring. The only suspense was waiting for something interesting to happen. Also, the ending was terrible. It did not belong in this type of movie."
2,"No style, no substance.","Most repetitious and boring film I have ever seen. The whole film is told through a specific point of view and the filmmakers throw that concept out the window at the end. Final scene does not work with the rest of the movie. This film was promoted as one of the first ""Digital"" feature films, too bad it has no style and no substance. Interesting concept poorly done."
1,It Sucked,"The movied sucked, the best part was the ending. That actually was quite hilarious. Not worth the 99 cents though."
2,a few good elements but mostly just dull,"I could barely stay awake while watching this, and I forced myself to watch it all the way to the end...which turned out to be poorly conceived. It would have been better if the filmmakers had shown ambiguous footage that implied a real Jersey Devil, rather than just having the killer turn out to be a regular, dull human being after all.It's also difficult to watch because of all the effects, blurriness, wavering lines, and static that they seem to think makes it more realistic but is actually just irritating."
4,book review purchase,"This was actually a gift, and we were very pleased. The book was in better condition than the seller stated! Very nice, thank you"
5,Not just for consultants,"Some of the most practical, real-world advice on marketing I've ever read. As the author of numerous books on marketing myself, I rarely learn something new from a book, but this one is full of insights and little treasures. Highly recommended as a basis for a good all-around overview or audit of your practices and especially for building the business of anyone in professional services."
4,Scholarly Zen,"Why did I only give the book 4 stars? Many of you may be wondering that. Because the writing is very boring and the approach is too academic. The irony is I came to review the book and realized the only essay I truly got something from was the same mentioned in the previous two reviews-""The Supreme Spiritual Ideal"". The rest, in my honest opinion, was written for a different kind of Zen student in the earlier half of the 19th century. Where Zen was looked at as a scholarly and intellectual philosophy, to be understood through academia.I try, on the other hand, to not become too critical of Daisetz Suzuki. He is one reason Zen made it's way to the West, after all. In that respect I really do thank him, but also I must be true to the people buying books here on Amazon and give my take on the material at hand. If you want another book on Zen that sits on your shelf collecting dust, I have to say, I think you've found it right here. But to each their own, you may find it engaging as well."
4,An Excellent Peice Of Green Day Work,"Green Day's 1997 release, Nimrod, showed a massive evolution beyond their punk roots. They open with the classic Green Day punk riff that moves into the instant favorite and truthful NICE GUYS FINISH LAST, immedatly following that is the raging HITCHIN' A RIDE. Both peices show that Green Day are moving beyond their humble roots, they have expanded their style and progressions until they are something to be feared. They esclate into the complaining THE GROUCH which shows the world from my father's point of view (No I'm not in Green Day). They then move on to the more vocal REDUNDANT showing that it never is really good enough. Of the 18 songs many shine, but none better than GOOD RIDDANCE (TIME OF YOUR LIFE). A depressing acoustic ballad that could not have been better proudiced. The band finishes the set with PROSTHETIC HEAD, comedic and fast, gritty punk song. All in all, Green Day had improved their skills and honed in on the sound that makes them work."
1,"""Good Riddance"" was so good, what happened?","I'll say one positive thing about this CD: Good Riddance. As for everything else?... it ain't pretty.It's the sheer idiocy of the ""Nimrod"" songs that offends me, not the cussing. It also offends me that this band thinks they can please its fans by doing nothing but cussing. I saw an MTV concert video clip where the singer just said, and I quote,""aw d@*n f**k f***in' s**t."" What's wrong with this guy? Does he have Tourette's syndrome? His cussing sure as heck does not done to aid in the effectiveness of the music, so he shouldn't be doing it. If you don't find the lack of respect this band has for its fans disturbing then you need to grow up and realize they that if they can't talk decently to their fans, they don't care. Wasn't that already covered in ""Longview""?Good Riddance: 10 out of 10Everything else: -1"
1,GREEN DAY SOLD PUNK OUT!,i hate this album greenday has strayed soo far from their roots and still claim they are punk i dont get it there giving punk a bad name considering they're one of the most popular bands of our time. punk is not ment to be mainstream leave me alone
5,Something You Can Enjoy for A Long Time,"This was the first CD I bought and I really liked it. The stand out ""Time of Your Life"" will make discover old memories and smile. Personally, that and ""uptight"" and the best I believe. Uptight is a hilarious, fast/slow song that you can really get a good beat with. It's all good. Buy it."
5,Best CD of my life!,"This is in-all-seriousness the BEST cd ive ever listened to in my life. I listened to it on the headphones in the CD store first and i couldnt help but smile and bop away to the music. Tunefull rock music, much better than Dookie(which gets very, very repetative and boring, i cant wait for the next album if its anywheer near as good as this. Its been in my CD player none stop for over a month, and its not gonna move anytime soon :) Best songs - Scattered,Uptight, and GoodRiddance. BUY IT!"
4,loved it loved it loved it,"This is definetly one of my favorite Greenday CD's. All of the songs are great in their different ways...I mean, compare Platypus (I hate you) to Time of your Life..2 completly different types of songs, but both worth listening to. Stop reading this and buy it!"
4,Pretty damn good,"To put it plainly, I liked Dookie better. I am a punk fan, so that figures. If you are at all into the melodic, soft rock side of Green Day, I recommend going with Nimrod. You will like ""Redundant"", ""Good Riddance"", etc. Do not fear, loyal punk fans! Green Day stays true to their roots on this album (well, a little bit) with headbangin' songs like ""Haushinka"", ""Take Back"", and ""Reject"". There are a lot of songs on this album, so whichever side of Green Day you prefer, you will find something you like. Go ahead and buy it."
2,Punk Rock Hipocracy,"Green Day are such hypocrites, on this album especially. There are some gems, like The Grouch, Good Riddance (Time of Your Life), Uptight, and many more. However, in many songs, they sing about rebellion, so they can opress others. Although they don't actually say that, many songs (especially Reject) show this attitude. Uptight has themes involving angst, but they bash these same feelings in Prosthetic Head. Platypus (I Hate You) is the worst track on the whole thing. Lyrics like ""No one loves you and you know it"" should not be praised. Who do they think they are?"
2,I thought they'd grown up. Guess I was wrong.,"Well, I heard ""Hitchin' a Ride"" and thought it was awesome. Then I heard ""Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)"" and I thought it was pretty good. Then I read a couple of articles about the album and they said with the violins and horns that they were getting into a more mature phase. Yeah, right! Just about every song is just like any other Green Day song: somewhat catchy and full of swearing. I don't know how an album with so much swearing in it doesn't get a parental advisory sticker on it. I guess their label didn't want to scare off business. Needless to say, I was not impressed. If I was reviewing a single of ""Hitchin' a Ride,"" I'd give it four or five stars because it's one of their all-time greats. But, as it is, there is very little on this album to recommend."
1,Don't waste your time,"GreenDay's records are poor, songs are all the same, musically speaking, there's a poor composition. Their songs are based in three basic chords (G, A, B), it makes them REALLY BORING! Don't waste your time, try looking for really good music."
1,This CD Sucks!,"This is the worst CD I have ever bought. I hate the way Green Day tries to become trendy with pathetic attempt to get on the ska bandwagon with King for a Day. I also really hate Good Riddance. What the hell are violins doing on a so-called ""punk"" band's CD? If you like the sound of this song, don't buy the CD. They release a single that is really soft sounding and then they throw really hard songs at you like Reject, Take Back, Platypus, Jinx, and Prosthetic Head. All of these songs have screaming vocals and heavy guitar that shows absolutely no talent.This CD should definetly have a parental advisory because they say the ""F word"" 19 times on it. I don't mind the ""F word"" that much but when it becomes all you say on a CD, it shows that you suck as a songwriter.Green Day has the best drummer and bassist in the music industry but Billy Joe Armstrong ruins it with his awful songwriting, hard guitaring, and screamed vocals. Don't make the same mistake I did. Don't buy this CD!"
2,petite,"This item is pretty but very small. I purchased it for my 8 year old daughter, but I feel it would be too small for me to wear. There are diamonds, but they are barely visible."
1,Horrible Customer Service...,"I got this charger for my palm treo 700wx from verizon wireless it does not fit at all... Even when i force it into the charger slot it will not fit.. This is false advertising and when I contact the customer service and told them I have received the wrong charger they acted like I was dumb and didn't know how to put the charger in the right slot. They are very persistent on making the point across that they are right and I am wrong.. They took no responsiblity to offer me a refund or sent me another charger. When I compare the two chargers, the one they had sent me that they say is ""compatible"" with my phone was significantly larger. I will never do business with them again.. This thing was so cheap I could care less about the refund this place is a joke...."
3,Premium Cellnet Retractable Charger,"Price is good. Company shipped it right away. The light on the charger is too bright and the charger makes a high pitch buzzing noise.For the price, both faults are acceptable."
4,sub woofer,"its was neat but it was to weak for my amp, thats my fault though, it came as promised and in perfect condition."
5,Great affordable replacement subs,These are pretty good bang for the buck. Bought them as cheap replacements for age deteriorated 1974 pioneer subs. Didnt even have to change the female spade connectors to hook them up! (yes they have spade connectors NOT RCA styleSound great and the same age of amp can handle them very nicely. Not sure how they would do for car audio stuff but for home theater 5 stars all the way.
2,Lasted 2 Months **UPDATE**,"I have a 200 Watt amp, that managed to blow this sub a week after the 30 day return window...I have a regular 10 inch Kicker coming in today, hopefully that lasts me much longer.Update (12.01.2012)So, I've had my 10 inch Kicker for a few days now. It sounds better, which was expected. What I didn't expect was after I changed from this PYLE to the Kicker, my lights no longer dimmed, and my amp no longer gets hot. Please if you can afford it, just avoid this sub. You won't regret it."
1,Dnt buy them!!!!!,I bought one and I waz using it 4 about Mmm 10 min and low bass and volume and it jst gave out on or something it did nt work
5,great buy,i bought two of these i guess not off amazon but thats where i saw them. the only reason i bought two was beacause if i blew one i had a back up. i did blow one i dont know how or understand how i did because the one that blew wasnt used much at all and the one that has practily been used for about a year give or take a few weeks has been kicking a$$ with the deepness of the bass. i have a 300 watt bridged amp running it and it works perfect
5,Timely and Thought-Provoking,"This is one of the best suspense/action novels concerning Israel that I have read. I did not want to put it down. The book also provides a vivid description of modern Israeli society and its internal tensions. After reading this novel, I felt that I had gained some insight into this strategic and often misunderstood country."
1,Won't burn,"The music on this album is fine, great, I love Ween. What has really offended my husband and I about the actual CD and its format is that we are not able to burn a full copy of the CD. We always copy our CDs because when you play them in the car they get terribly scratched up and stop working after a little while. But we can't burn this CD, not on our computers or anyone else's. They formatted it in a way that prevents us from burning a copy, for our own personal use. Bad show. Were it not for this straight-up rude format, it would be a five-star item."
2,Flat,"I debated about how many stars to give this movie. The cast is good, especially the actor who portrays Jason (I can't think of his name). The other actors are okay, too, but the story is flat, and just as I was thinking at the end about rating it, it ended. I HATE the ending. The story is pretty good, but it just never quite gets there, and it leaves you wanting. Dianne Wiest is great as usual, and for her performance and for Jason, I'd give them 5 stars for sure. Otherwise.... Eh. I would have given it one star if it weren't for those two performers."
2,Didn't Deliver,"Despite the reasonably fine acting and sentimentality of the plot, this film came across more as a ""Hallmark"" Made-for TV Special. A lot of stock characters and hackneyed situations detracted from the potential dramatic impact. No, I'm not insensitive to people who have experienced major losses, but, for me, this movie failed to live up to what it could have been."
4,"Adorable, but too many flaps","Like another reviewer, I purchased this book for a Blue's Clues-loving 1.5-year-old who tore two of the flaps in the first five minutes. The book is cute, but the parents told me there were just too many flaps -- that's a lot to open for a tot who has a short attention span."
2,Beware cheap flaps,"Although the book itself is entertaining, the flaps are made of a flimsy cardboard material.Needless to say, it took my 2 year old son all of 10 minutes to rip some off as he tried to pick up the book, while holding an open flap."
3,Its not a Tonkas.....,Oh it makes noises and that gets old but the 4 y/o likes it but its not metal so do not expect it to last
2,dull & grating,"boy is this bland. i bought it for $2.99 on a whim (and 'cause i had 'em mixed up with the libertines, whoops). as someone once said about walter cronkite talking about, uh, walter cronkite, ""this is dry as toast."" &that's the way it is."
5,Whatever happened to this incredibly talented author?,"I just finished reading this book, right after ""The Silver Devil"". I absolutely loved both books and this book especially is unforgettable. The characters, time period, the conflicts, everything about this book is fabulous. I wish authors like Teresa Denys write more books."
4,A remarkable confession,"A remarkable confession from an ultra-Orthodox Rabbinic leader who admits to fatal errors in having been linked to a mistaken theology. Rabbi Teichthal, employing Biblical and Rabbinic sources, urges the wounded saving remnant to re-embrace Eretz Yisrael, the metaphoric mother of Israel, who awaits the return of her children from the costly exile. He was murdered towards the end of the Shoah and never lived to realize his prophetic vision."
1,REALLY Disappointed In Quality,"There has been absolutely no snow in the state of Minnesota this year. This being said, I bought my nephew a sled for Christmas which has become a joke because I told him maybe he would be able to use it next year. Since Christmas, there has been enough snow for 2 neighborhood sled days. I say neighborhood sled days because there are not any extreme hills or rough terrain to sled on in their neighborhood. The brake broke the 1st day! A broken brake doesn't keep this sled from being usable & it is fast--but I think if you are going to have an option like a brake on a sled that as a customer I should expect it to last longer than a day. It IS built as a ""kids' sled"". Unfortunately, they didn't tell me about it breaking right away so now I missed the return deadline."
1,This sled is dangerous,"Used this sled the night of a new snowfall - worked well for a few runs. Came back the next day, when the snow was more packed from more sledders using the hill. After the first run, a handle and side cracked off. On the second run, the back corner cracked off. On the third run, the other side cracked off. The fourth run was never completed; the sled literally cracked in half. The front of the sled kept going, the back just lay there while I was sent aimlessly rolling down the hill. This product is amazingly cheap. Would you let your kids use a sled that breaks up into sharp plastic bits? I guess it depends how much you like them. Zero stars."
4,Good stating point,The Tools of Screenwiritng delivers as promised. There are better books for beginners out there like [...] but overall the Tools of Screenwriting covers most the basics in an easy to understand style.
1,Rubbish,"The cracker hinge snapped when working its second 1.5 lbs lobster ever. I live on the coast in New England, not cool."
5,this is a must get cd!,"hi y'all! this cd is da bomb!! its got really good lyrics, and there is an awsome rap sung by one of the guys. im not sayin who, that will spoil the fun. just get the cd! c ya!"
5,This is the BEST song...,I hear the dance mix in the clubs and I tip the DJ 6 bucks to hear it every time I go there. Does this CD single have the dance mix on it? I want more dance mixes from you guys! They're too hard to find!
5,This CD is INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!! You'll love it!,"This CD is really great. ""U Drive Me Crazy"" has the same awesome sound as all of the other 'N Sync songs, but with a bit of a twist. Each one of the versions is incredible. I hope that you love this CD as much as I do."
5,This is aweomse!,"Once again, *nsync puts out a great song with good lyrics and a good beat. This is a song everyone can relate to and everyone can dance to!"
4,Works well,"I received as a birthday present last year (great gag gift, Dad). I finally opened it up after finishing Gold Bond Ultimate comfort. This stuff is 'softer' due to its talc formula and applies smoother than corn starch. The scent is nice too. I recommend this product though I have only been using it for 4 days."
1,Ordered the 3 but only got 1,"I ordered this from ""MetaRetail Inc"" which is what was the main seller at least when I bought it. The price was marked as ""$8.59 ($2.86 / Item)"" which means that I was supposed to get 3 as the picture showed. But I was only sent 1. The price for the 1 isn't THAT bad but the listing is clear that I should have gotten 3. False advertising."
4,Savage Cusack,"Cusack plays Hoops in a role that can best be described as a typical John Cusack role. Demi Moore plays a supporing role/love interest for Cusack is a way that is very different for Demi. If you are a fan of Cusack, Savage Steve Holland, or 80s movies then you will like this. Similar to ""Better Off Dead."""
3,One wacky decade!,"Here's something I guarantee you will never see on a film festival marquee: ""Tonight:Savage Steve Holland: An Auteur's Retrospective"". Okay--maybe...in France. Alright--most likely... at an Eighties Theme Party. ""One Crazy Summer"" is another typically silly yet likeable 80's cinematic slopfest of the ""Caddyshack"" variety.A young John Cusack plays the mostly reactive Bill Murray character here, wryly observing the ""wacky"" behavior (and shameless camera mugging) of various 80's niteclub comics like Bobcat Goldthwaite, Taylor Negron and Rich Hall. Demi Moore gives an appealing performance, actually showing more acting promise at this stage of her career(before she started to take herself too seriously).Unintentional laughs abound during some sloppy lip-synching scenes where Demi, wearing her folk singer duds and strumming her acoustic guitar, somehow sounds more like a rockin' Pat Benatar (and gets an electric guitar sound out of that acoustic!)Good mindless fun."
1,All rerecycled stuff.,"Full of old, old cliches begining with a high school named Generic. The crazy uncle, the aunt who hands out a check to guests she serves meals in her home, the hardware owner, a crazy retired military man who loves bombs and guns, stupid vehicle chases with the vilians driving into the sea, and on and on infinitum.I like Cusack movies but apparently his early ones are all bombs."
5,great classic 80s comedy,"This is definitely a wacky comedy. One of it's most known features is that a young Demi Moore is in it. It's also directed by Savage Steve Holland who also did Better Off Dead with John Cusack. One Crazy Summer contains some of the same trademark animation bits as in Better Off Dead. The humor is definitely 80s, but it's still very funny today. There are a lot of small details that can be passed up if not paying attention, like the high school being Generic High School in Generic, New York. If you love the 80s or wacky comedies, this one's a hit for you."
1,sucks!,All they do is scream....you cant even hear what they're trying to say...and ALL of the songs sound the same....like they use the same guitar rythms in each and every song!
2,trilogy = great start boring conclusion,"This first book i liked a lot. It has a bit of a burgeoning love story, and a nice plausible development with a fair balance of action. The problem is that book II is not so good at all, almost bad, and book III, gads i hate to say was really bad. so my rating is an average rating. In reality these trilogies should be viewed as a whole, because the fact that this book was good is quite misleading."
4,"Razor sharp, a solid drum n bass mix.","I first saw Reid Speed at the Winter Music Conference of 2002. She did a tag set with DJ DB, who is also with Breakbeat Science. I also caught her at BOO6 in NY. I was very impressed, so I picked up Resonance and was just as satisfied. The tracks at the end slack a bit, just a bit, thats why I did not give it a 5. But overall a solid album and debut with BBS. Keep it up Reid!"
5,Finally a drum & bass CD worth listening to...,"When I first heard about drum & bass, I was thinking fast, extreme, hardcore music. But most of the stuff out there ended up being too slow or too weird which turned me off to the whole genre. I don't know, maybe that's what it's all about since I'm new to the scene. But I finally came across a flyer promoting Reid Speed and thought I'd give it one more chance. She has definitely sparked my interest in drum & bass again. This is what I expect from a drum & bass CD. Thanks Reid. You are awesome."
5,Insightful and uplifting,"I love it!!! I got this card because I'm very much connected to the place and wanted to get as much info about it as possible. The card is just beautiful and the artworks have an ethereal quality. You can almost sense the energy of Atlantis. I highly recommend that you put your intention to connect with it to get maximum results. Using it has not only provided me with info about Atlantis, but also provided me with deep insights and clearer understanding of myself and my situation."
3,smaller than I expected,"This is very nice looking, but too small to hold a whole pony-tail worth of hair. It might be okay for a young girl, but not strong enough for a grown woman's hair."
1,Not happy,I am not happy with this toy at all. I was very excited to get it because the only thing my daughter wanted for Christmas was a horse she could sit on. From the pictures this appeared to be it but the pictures are very misleading compared to what I received. In my opinion tt is not worth the money I spent. There is no way this little girl is sitting on the horse like the one that I got. It is simply a stuffed animal with no infrastructure. I was looking for a stuffed horse that my daughter could sit on but this is not it. If you are looking for anything more than a stuffed toy I would say you do not want this horse.
2,Talk about a let down!,"I was so let down when I opened this and did not find Melissa. You only get Doug the Horse in this ""set"". Amazon or the company should change the name of this product."
2,its not to ride,"DONT PUT UR CHIKD IN HERE TO RIDE!! For one,it gets their hopes up and they never want to get off. But in all honesty, its not made to ride. My daughter is 5 and weighs 40 lbs. But the front left leg actually collapsed while she snuck on it. It scared her cuz she thought she broke her new horse. I bought this for her cuz she wants a real horse and I have not the money or the room for one. I thought it would be a good substitute. I think we r both disappointed. But the horse is here to stay. Even if all it does is take up room and collect clothes. :-("
2,"OK puzzle, dislike sound","I would not recommend this puzzle. Vehicle pictures are just stickers on wood, so not very durable. Sounds are incredibly loud, distorted, and annoying. Also, this puzzle is light-activated, so that if you walk into the room & turn on the light switch, this puzzle sounds off. Which has woken up the kids in the middle of the night, not to mention given me a heart attack! My kids don't play with it as much as they do with similar puzzles, I think because they don't like the noise. To turn off, you need to take out the batteries."
1,So bad - don't buy it!,"I bought this puzzle in a store for my 22 mos. grandson. I bought it twice because the first one didn't work. The sound would work at times and not at others. I thought it was a fluke and so i bought another one. That one was even worse, in that it worked minimally the first night, which upset my grandson very much. I returned them both! I am so surprised that Melissa and DOug would manufacture this, or continue to manufacture it after all the negative reviews. I wish I had read them before buying these puzzles. I will not make that mistake again."
3,Not for Sensitive Kids!,"My little boy is now 2 and he still freaks out if he hears the sounds this puzzle makes. He cries and runs out of the room. It also has a tendency to go off at sunset or whenever the light level in the room changes. We took the batteries out for a while, and he was fine with it. Not long ago I put them back in, thinking maybe he'd be okay with the sounds now, but no, he gets just as upset as before.This is probably better for an older child (3+) who can understand that it's nothing to be afraid of."
1,BEWARE- Sounds don't work!,"I really wanted to like this toy. My 20 month old daughter is enthralled with vehicles right now, but HALF of the SOUNDS DON""T WORK. Or work only some of the time. We have other sound puzzles, by Melissa and Doug, that don't have this problem. Additionally, these sounds are brassy unlike our other puzzles. I wouldn't be able to recognize a particular vehicle's sound without looking at the pictures. Too bad because it is a great idea. I would definitely pass on this toy."
4,gift for grandson,"My 3 year old grandson thought this was fun. Since he is into cars and trucks and can identify their sounds, He played with it for 5 minutes before returning to the hot wheel-type vehicles."
3,Good Enough,"We bought this puzzle for our 28 month old son. He loves anything with wheels and enjoys playing with this. He loves it when we jumble the pieces on the floor and then ask him to find and put a particular vehicle back on the board. The only problem we have is that the sound does not work at all. It worked for maybe the first 5 minutes of play. This is not a big deal to him, but it made the puzzle not worth the $10 we paid for it."
4,A mystery that keeps you guessing,"Unless you are aware that the book itself IS a mystery, and read the crucial 2 questions on the backof the book and continually remind yourself of them, the first 3 quarters of the book seem like theyre heading in the direction you want and expect them to...but if youre not alert and pondering, the end will grab you like a string...the persn you don't expect, the person who is accused of killing the person who you didnt expect...its all baffling for a traditional mystery, but it even has a happy ending to go along with it!"
2,A banal plot,"During the summer of 1976, Adam Verne-Smith inherits a big old country house in Suffolk, Wyvis Hall. He collects around him a group of shady and careless young people: Rufus, Shiva, Vivien and Zosie. With carelessness of youth they plunder, steal, pawn, scavenge and sell the family heirlooms. In 1986 the bodies of a young woman and child are discovered in a strange animal cemetery by the owners of Wyvis Hall. Adam, Rufus and the others have reasons to fear as the truth about what happened at Wyvis Hall in 1976 slowly comes to light.The characters are not particularly well drawn, the plot a succession of banal events. Although Mrs Vine is interested in borderline personalities, the psychology of her characters in this novel can be described as uninteresting at best."
3,A Fatal Inversion is not Rendel's best work,A Fatal Inversion has a fatal flow. It's redundant and takes too long to say whatever it wants to say
2,Predictable and dull,"The story is far from original now but maybe it was when it was written. (Group of debauched and at least one mentally unbalanced friends live together during young adult years and one or more of them kills another told in flashbacks). There was pretty much no suspense for me as a reader because it became fairly obvious half way through the book what had happened. I also could care less about the lives of the main characters (which I was told about in great depth and detail) because I despised all of them. They weren't even interesting in a bad way, they were just spoiled and selfish self-indulgent jerks. Flawed main characters are fine, but at least make them interesting so I actually care what happens to them! It felt for me like a story I had to slog through in the hopes that it would eventually become more exciting. It does, but unfortunately that happens on the last page and it is not enough to save this book."
4,3 1/2 Stars,"I liked it, it was decent enough to keep me turning the pages. Nothing memorable. Good study in the psyche of the character's mind."
1,A dissapointment for the whole family,"My son and I rented this movie in hopes of educational entertainment. The only entertainment and education we got was from thumbing through Genesis and discussing the historical inaccuracies of the film.In the words of my eleven year old son, ""it was a horrible movie."""
1,Holy Smoke!,"Good God, i was actually an extra in this movie in Melbourne and i could not believe just how bad it was until i watched it!Sets were good, food good, pay good, movie ATROCIOUS!!Do yourself a favour and buy Barney instead!"
1,This film is very inaccurate,"I would be surprised if the producers of this film even read the Bible.This movie is FULL of errors and contradicts what is written in the Bible.The destruction of Sodom and Gamorrah happend nearly 1,000 years AFTER the great flood. There were No survivors of the flood except for those on the Ark. There were no pirates roaming the waters after the flood. Noah didn't shut the door to the Ark, God did.The acting is very poor and portrays God in a very blasphemous manner.If you are looking for a story about what REALLY happened with Noah's Ark, Don't waste your time or money with this hideous and God-forsaken excuse for a movie.You would find better accuracy in one of the children's animated version where talking giraffes have the job of watching for icebergs and warn Noah when they see one."
2,Not true to the Bible,"The movie wouldn't have been a lot better if they had stuck to the Bible and hadn't added so much and twisted everything around. If you want to learn about Noah, read the Bible, don't get this movie!"
1,An Anachronism,"Having watched great movies in the Bible series such as Joseph, David, Abraham, Jacob, Moses and Samson and Delilah and other good ones pertaining to scriptures, I was looking forward to another fantastic and educative film. What a let down by this anachronism. How low can one go! This is a disappointing and misleading movie that perverts the word of God.If you do not believe in God, have never read the Bible, particularly Genesis but have heard of Noah from hearsay, perhaps this movie might be of some entertaining value, a mediocre one at that.If you are looking for a movie with an accurate account of Noah's ArK, don't aggravate yourself. Avoid this movie like a plague."
2,"OK, but violent.","This movie starts out with a terribly violent battle in which Noah is in. The film goes on slowly and just when you think the violence has ended, there's more. 10 year olds may enjoy it, but this is not a good family movie. However, despite all the violence, Voight does a good job as Noah."
4,"Irreverent, dark comedy about the end of a civilization","Peter Barnes' witty script takes wild liberties with the Biblical story, but opens up some of the intriguing moral questions behind it in the process. The direction is more plodding than the script, though, so it may not have occured to all the viewers that they were watching what was intended as a dark comedy. But it's a funny tale in a very dry way (so to speak), as the ark becomes a kind of ""Endgame"" with oars and elephants. Barnes also wrote the terrific (and similarly sacrilegious) ""The Ruling Class"" in the late 1960's."
2,Review,"Ordered hardback, got a paperback. Printing dim or missing in several places. The book itself was so-so"
5,Fascinating!,"A short review. You will travel with the characters across the globe, in romance, drinking gin and vodka, hunting and horse racing. Witness friendship and murder. Learn of the tea trade, violent revolutionary socialism, opium drug addiction. Fine antiquity auctions plus so much more. Wow, what an adventure. I would advise reading the two books."
4,a smoother read than i had thought it would be,"i had always wondered why it was near impossible to find this book, unlike the other dumas novels which had been turned into movies. the reason is apparent; the book has nothing to do with the movie, beyond the notion of sympathetic twins.yet this is a nice read, more of a novella than a short story -- you should be able to finish it in two hours. and it gives a nice idea of that travel writer that dumas was, tho we barely know him as such. this is a good travelog of 19th century corsica (and certainly more readable than trash like thoreau's bloated ""cape cod"".)don't expect d'artagnan or edmond dantes, but settle in for a pleasant afternoon's read."
1,not even one full star,"This movie deserves a bullet, not a star...it was just bad. Poorly acted and written. I love and support Independent films and rarely am I as disappointed as I was by this one."
3,Nice Little Film...,"The film was a gift and I finally watched it with a few friends and we had a great time. Was it the company or the film, not sure, but it was a nice little film, albeit low budget, that gave us a good night of hanging out."
4,great,"I have always loved Can, so got this. I thought it was going to be a little slight and too poppy, but hearing this taught me, again, never to underestimate a genius.Movies is dance music, in a way far removed from the avant gaurde girations if Tago Mago or Ege Bysamai. But this is no pop album. All the numbers have lots of little eletronic abstractions thrown like confetti on a glue board. Surprises pop up everywhere, and are parts of layers of sound.In Can, Czukay always kept his bass playing slight, by choice: Can was, after all, an oasis of restraint in a world of 70s art rock excess. On Movies, though, he streches out, with fabulous art disco playing; lots of little pops, runs and fills. Still, it reminds tight and taunt and fits this music perfectly.All this makes this a very enjoyable and a very subtanative dance record: progressive dance to the hilt. Absolutely a must buy."
5,"Run, don't walk, to get your hands on this release!","This album, released in the latter 1/2 of this year 2006, is destined to be one of my favorites of the year. The band, made up of husband and wife duo Jack Drag and Blake Hazard, are proprietors of very catchy hooks and melodies. Though but a duo, their sounds fill up a room, and make even hard-hearted Indie music snobs cry in their beer with their sweet lyrical tales of broken relationships and reconciliation. It's easy to find oneself listening to this on repeat."
1,"Never recieved a copy, three months have passed","I ordered American Cake Decorating Magazine direct from the company in December 2009, it's March 2010.I have never recieved anything from them, but they did charge my credit card immediately.Yes, its true, they ""tend to create a vacumn"".Run do not walk, get away from these people as fast as you can.CraigmAmerican Cake Decorating Magazine"
1,Never got the magazine,"Much like everyone else, I waited far too long and never got the magazine. What a sad organization that cannot provide the product you pay for. I waited 5 months - each time I called the magazine they said that the issue 'was in the mail' to me. In fact, when I most recently called they said I only had 4 of the 6 issues left on my subscription, even though I had never gotten one! The one positive is that customer service quickly and easily refunded my money - probably because they have to do it so often from the same complaint."
1,Beware of this Magazine Reseller!!!!,"This subscription is being sold by a reseller called Magazine Express, Inc. I had this purchased for me and paid for in early December as a gift and just found out I will not receive my first issue until June! After researching I have found they are known for collecting money but not starting subscriptions until you call to complain. And for me, even then I was told I have to wait months to receive the first issue. I understand some of the delay being that it is only published 6 times a year, but this delay seems excessive. American Cake Decorating is a great magazine, but beware of the seller."
5,Must have,"'When Paper Meets Pen' gives a realistic look at life in all aspects. From straight reality to the hopes and dreams we wish for, Ms. Jones talks about it all. If you had the privilege of seeing the author read at local clubs and restaurants in the Washington, DC/ Metropolitan area, you'll recognize the same captivating energy in the book. For those who haven't had the opportunity, it is an experience like no other. Some poems are fun and entertaining. Others will leave you thinking for days."
5,Trends,Great Author and seems to be very knowledgeable. Even if you disagreewith his advice I think you will like the delivery he makes. They trulyare trends for the future.
3,A Chewy Christmas In Connecticut,"Remakes are always tough and this one is no exception. It is enjoyable and stimulates the Christmas ""mood"" while not taking itself too seriously and not attempting to be more than it is. It reminds me of eating a Pop Tart that has been microwaved rather than toasted - looks just as good but doesn't go down as easily as the taste and texture are a little ""off""."
3,If you like quotes then there are some good ones in here ...,I am not sure there is a quote book that is a five star ... maybe? But I like quotes and this one is okay. The editor has put in here quotes from George Washington and Thomas Jefferson to Ali and some are great others not so great but a nice cross section and I was okay with the whole thing.
2,Decent Action,"Overall, good action & excellent camera shots.Maybe needed to focus a little more on the race and less on the Celeberty Racers ! More focus on the under-dogs. Just an amateurs opinion."
3,Very Good Documentary,"I thought this was a very good documentary for people that are into racing, motorcycles and off road enduro racing. I am not sure that somebody who isn't into those things would like it but I found it quite compelling and entertaining. For all you gear heads, bikers, and racing fans check it out I think you'll like it very much.Oh and by the way it says that this stars Steve McQueen. Steve McQueen and James Garner appear for all of 2 seconds in this when they show people who have been in this race in the past."
5,Very satisfied..,I am very satisfied with this FM traffic receiver. Now I don't need to tune my radio again and again to know the traffic. I can plan my route without any hasitation. It works great. I highly recommend this traffic receiver for Garmin GPS.
1,Save your money,"This item worked for about 4 weeks. Now the FM receiver portion of the device is dead and it is an expensive power cable. Every few minutes the device flashes a message ""CHECK TRAFFIC RECEIVER"" to remind me it is broken, which is really really annoying. Next time I am trying another brand, I thought Garmin was the best but not anymore."
1,Never received the item purchased,"I have placed an order to purchase a Garmin GTM 20 FM-Band Traffic Receiver, and I never received it. I contacted the seller to just be ignored. I am going to dispute it with the Amazon credit card I used to purchase the product.Sincerely,Rosa De Candia"
3,Not so sure if it is worth it,"I don't do a lot of out of town highway travel, so I'm not sure this really helps me with my local traffic. I have found it very accurate, but if I have chosen the freeway route, I typically already know what the traffic will be like from the TV or radio. Where I do see some value...it helps to make the ETA on the GPS route more accurate. I think if I drove cross country it would help me decide whether to use through town or perimeter routes as I am approaching large cities. It works, I just don't think it does anything for ME on my daily commutes. I often find myself saying, ""oh yeah, there's the traffic jam I see on the GPS"". In Atlanta, at least, it does nothing for the surface streets."
1,"Easy to BREAK, traffic updates are practically worthless","Product broke while trying to remove from cigarette lighter. For a $200 part I'd expect them to design this to be little more sturdy. Traffic updates are barely any use. It oftenly shows an incident that's no longer an issue or doesn't show problems that it should.Getting this unit with your GPS is fine, just be careful when removing it from the cigarette lighter.Do not consider buying this if it didn't come with your GPS. It's a waste of money."
2,Wonderful Cast...,"I love Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman! How they got involved in this mess I'll never understand. A round robin of encounters between unlikeable and unappealing people set in a snow and frost blasted little Scottish village. They bicker, bicker, bicker. The playwrite seems to be aiming for Tennessee Williams of the frozen north--I couldn't get over the feeling that I have seen these stories before in better material. The most interesting character was the frozen sea...I wanted to know more about that."
3,The Winter Guest,"I was disappointed with this video because it did not have closed captioning and because the Scottish accents are very authentic, it was difficult to understand what everyone was saying. The scenery was lovely, however."
1,Not Viewable in Australia,Buyer beware !!!- I was told by the seller that this DVD was viewable in Australia - but it is not ! - Do NOT buy from this seeler!!!
1,AN UNFORTUNATE MISHAP FROM BEGINNING TO END,"Oh, what wonderful music. Great score. Buy the CD. And forgo EVERYTHING else. Tis is one of those wonderful ideas which go terribly wrong. May very well have beeen a solid play, on stage, but translated, here, to film - an unmitigated DISASTER. The wonderful Phyllida Law is reduced to a cartoon of a human being. Emma Thompsen is the narciscistic central figure; a mess. Woefully unedited. The script is allowed to run rampent. Truly disappointing. Bravo to Alan Rickkman for trying. But run screaming past this one - in hopes of better."
5,klipsch rocks!,"Forget 5.1, get this system for your pc. I love the volume control with bass & master plus a headphone jack and an additional input for my MP3 minidisc player."
3,KEN U SAY NEK?,NEK gets in the charts regularly with very smooth romantic pop ballads that make us girls swoon. 'Sto con te' is the reason i bought the album. But at least 4 other songs here hit the charts too. Also nice - the complete lyrics are included.
3,WWII Aerial Combat,"A mixed bag produced by Hollywood shortly after WWII. The combat story is well done with first rate actors like Edmund O'Brien and Robert Stack. Humor about the ground crew sergeant as a lothario is distracting. Actual combat scenes include some film shot in the Pacific. Overall, an entertaining film that leaves any history buff asking for something better about the experiences of American fighter pilots during WWII."
5,LUV them,"So comfy, so cute. Great arch support, and stand up to the washer. Why, oh why did Adidas discontinue?"
3,Cries of the children,"Decent if rather simplistic. Wasn't great, wasn't awful. Would be a good story for the younger young adult category. Not particularly tension filled or scary."
4,Only 1 minor issue,"I bought these ties to hold my computer against the back wall of my desk and they work well enough, but there's another product somewhere on amazon that gives you twice as much for a similar price. I didn't buy that because it lost its super saver shipping when i tried to buy it.That said, this product serves its purpose and won't give out to a decent amount of force (pulling apart parallel to the adhesive)."
5,They come in handy,"Just the right length and very good value.I use these things for just about everything.I originally bought them for cable management on my PC and for organizing a bunch of extra cables I have in my junk drawer.They're surprisingly strong considering how thin each strip is.I repair PC's and laptops for friends and family. I slap these things on every single laptop charger I come across.I also found it great for organizing my dollar bills.At the end of every day, I toss the change from my pockets into buckets (one for pennies, one for everything else). From there, I take out all my $1 bills and put them in my drawer since they tend to be bulky when you have a bunch of them in your pocket.Once I reach $25 worth of bills, I use these velcro ties to place them in bundles. Once I deposit the money in the bank, I simply reuse the velcro ties on something else."
5,Work better than expected.,"These little things are thin and have unexpectedly good grip. They seem very durable. I used them to wrap up old cords that I don't use, as well as do some cord management behind the computer and TV. I was so impressed by these little guys I bought another pack, a really good product."
3,3 1/2 stars,"See storyline above. Preferrably the Booklist review.As a somewhat avid thriller reader, there was something about this novel that didn't take with me. There was action and some suspense but it seemed to lack the gripping pace and 'pull you in' writing that I come to expect.This is my first David Lindsey novel. I'm not sure if there will be another."
5,A Synthesizer Lovers Dream!,"While I have not had enough time to listen to Tangerine Dream's expansive library of music, I have to say of what I have heard, this is my most favorite on my list. If you love keyboards/synthesizers as much as I do (I am an 80's fanatic), you will not be disappointed. Also, the guitar riffs in this CD by co-founder Edgar Froese are outstanding! My persoanl favorite track is ""Dolphin Dance"" for its serious yet playful melody. As I hardly ever give any of my CD's the coveted ""5 stars"", this is an awesome listen for sure... if they only had this in SACD format (haven't found one yet), I could only imagine how expansive the sound would be... in a single word, ""Wow!""!"
4,Practice makes perfect,"I was originally skeptical but found the lessons to be good. Cantonese is a challenging language due to it's specific use of intonation and this program does well to emphasize this. Like any language, a lot of repetition is required but since it is in CD format it is convenient in the car or any travel situation. This is definitely a good start to learing Cantonese but instruction from someone fluent is needed in order to perfect the pronounciation."
5,Bittersweet: Carmen McRae,"I have been a fan of Carmen McRae since I was fifteen, and heardher album entitled ""Torchy."" Her voice is distinctive and lyrical, her enunciation, perfect, and her choice of material always stellar. Bittersweet is no exception.For me, ""Torchy"" (out of print in USA) has always been the ultimate Carmen---until ""Bittersweet.""Give yourself a special treat. Buy it.HCS: Ventnor, NJ"
5,The best baby video ever!,"Baby Music School is outstanding. My daughter, now 14 months old, has enjoyed it since she was about 6 months old. She loves it now more than ever. As a first time parent I thought I would NEVER let my child watch TV or videos, but this is not only delightfully entertaining to the baby, but positively stimulating to her little brain. Try it for yourself!"
2,Messy and Not Effective,"I was a little low on cash, so I avoided the Crest White Strips, and got the Crest Simply White. It is definatly not worth it! I painted it on my teeth, like it said to do, and plastered my mouth into an overly large grin to keep my lips from touching my teeth. It claims that it dries in 30 seconds, but I found it to be more like over 5 minutes. It is a pain! And when you do close your mouth at the recommended 30 seconds, it just wipes off on your gums, lips, and tongue, so there is barely any actually left on your teeth. Plus, the stuff that gets caught on your lips and tongue tastes horrible. Later I tried the white strips....much better!"
1,Singlefin yellow did not play,"Though the package came factory sealed, it would not play after the first minute. It was scratched and unplayable. I have mailed it back and am waiting to hear back."
1,Out of Date!,"This edition is obsolete as of the 2001 rule changes. Perry wrote a new edition for the 2001-2004 Racing Rules of Sailing, which is excellent and replaces this edition. This edition is worse than useless, as reliance on this outdated volume could lead you to break the (new) rules. This is a great series, mind you. Buy the new edition."
4,Good Dog Food,"I have two male Jack Russells. One started gaining weight and was quite a bit heavier than the other. I decided to try this food and it has worked very well for the heavier dog, but not well for the other. I gradually changed their food at the same time and the skinnier dog's stomach started rumbling and it just plain didn't agree with him. My thought was maybe the fiber content was too difficult for him to handle. I switched him back to the regular Blue Buffalo Chicken dog food and he has been fine. The heavier dog has been on this for over a year and has had no problems. His weight gain has stopped and he's even lost a couple of pounds. Make sure you gradually change your dog's food to this as an abrupt change will most likely give your dog problems."
1,Problems,Second Bag of the product and my 10 year Lab is still experiencing problems with diarrhea. We switched to Blue Buffalo Weight Control because our Chocolate Lab was starting to put on weight with Pro Plan Large Breed. Seems to like eating the food but on his daily walks he has to stop 3 to 4 times from his normal on stop with the dropping always remaining consistent. The Vet informed us this is a common problem with this product.Maybe just his system but problem corrected days after changing his food only.
3,Neither frisky nor lusty,"The instrumental tracks on this CD are lovely, but the vocals leave a lot to be desired in terms of style. They have taken very much of a choral approach- too formal a sound, in my opinion (stiff, formal, acoustics very much like in a church). If you enjoy renaissance vocals as recorded by Custer LaRue of the Baltimore consort, then this is not your style."
2,Not quite there,"I'm not a huge fan of the Star Trek novels, but I am a huge Pellegrino fan. Everything of his I have read before has been gold - this book just falls flat. There is something in the style and presentation that seems like it was ""dumbed down"" from his usual fare. The ending is also somewhat anti-climatic, but I think the plan was to leave some options open for the future. There is also too many referances to Pellegrino's past works - they seem forced. All in all this book seems rushed and misses the mark."
2,Bad character potrayal and too much science,"Having waited a long time to read this book since it to forever to appear at bookstores in Singapore, this book is, to say the least, a huge disappointment. The idea to re-visit the Dyson Sphere is well-conceived, but was wrecked in the hands of these two amateur writers. The book bombards you with long-winded and boring paragraphs of hard science, tiresome to read. The writers forget that the MAIN part of a novel is its characters. The characters behave unrealisticly, the dialouge is childish and the philosophy is weak. The resolution at the end is too convenient. The inclusion of the alien race Horta, of whom NO introduction is given, in the story does not appeal to me either."
4,Great science!,"Those who watched the TNG sixth season episode ""Relics"" with special guest star Scotty, will remember the Dyson Sphere which Scotty's ship crashed on. The crew of the Enterprise-E revisits the sphere to do an official research study on it. Along with them is a small ship of Horta (from the Original series episode, ""The Devil in the Dark""). Once inside the sphere, they discover an infinite surprises, which only a small fraction do they get the chance to explore."
4,An interesting and different Star Trek novel!,"This one is defintely different from the average Star Trek book! Picard and the Enterprise are dispatched to explore the Dyson Sphere they originally ran into during the television run. A federation starship run completely by Horta is sent with them to assist and speed up the exploration of the Dyson Sphere! This is a very interesting story to say the least. I would have to say I was expecting a little more or something different from this story. Not to mention the fact that it's at least forty pages short of an average trek book. That's not say this is a bad story though, it's a decent story overall. The author's captured Picard and crew pretty well and the Horta were done well. The villain, a neutron star hurled through a wormhole from the center of the galaxy at the sphere is explained in a somewhat vague way. This one is defintely for the hard core Star Trek collector/completist."
1,Total waste of money,"This stuff not only h\as a very unpleasant smell, but is nothing special at all. I would expect a million times more from a product that is from fake bake. The smell is actually gross, nothing like you would would think. Its kind of a burnt plastic, chemical smell. And does nothing extra for your skin except make it greasy like baby oil. Only not even as good as baby oil. Very disappointed and you are wasting your money if you buy this product."
4,Impressed BUT it was missing one KEY section,"I was very impressed with this doco and commend the directors BUT it missed one KEY section. There is NO live footage of WU-TANG in concert, there is a massive build up to the very time the curtains open and then... the credits... not even ONE live song from wu-tang.VERY DISAPOINTED!!!If your a fan of film then cop this disc but if your a fan of WU then i'd suggest you wait for Gza's doco coming out soon"
4,Light classics with historical charm,"Really enjoyed this CD. Light and pleasant, without being too pretentious. Great background music for home or office."
5,great music,Well constructed and fun to listen to/ I am not the jazz/ blues person of the family and I enjoyed the music.
1,Bogus collection,"This should be called the ""John Ford tiny collection"", as most of his major films are not included. Even ""John Ford the early years"" would at least alert customers to the fact that this is only a small sampling of Ford's work.Shame on Amazon for their collaboration in this matter, and for advertising the John Wayne/John Ford collection so closely that it is easy to mistake one for the other."
3,illustrator error,"This book boasts a gentle, lovely story about a child, family, and setting passed over by most children's book authors. However, in three separate scenes the school bus Root portrays is the same school bus you or I might have ridden on--one that is *not* wheelchair-accessible. So how on earth does Jamie Kay's brother, Marc, get on and off the bus in his wheelchair? One presumes Borton did not see the illustrations before the book was published, because she herself drives a school bus for children with disabilities that must look far different from the one Root portrays in order to do its job. I want to like this book much more than I do; _Fat Chance!_ is a better book by the same author."
2,just plain difficult,"This was the most difficult feeder my family has ever owned. The PROs of this product include its beauty and infrequent need for refills. While the product can hold a generous quantity of nectar, it was easily invaded by ants. It would often fill up with dead ants and I would have to clean it more often. The problem was that the bottle would still have plenty of sweet liquid inside. This meant a lot of waste. Additionally, the ants would get into all the nooks and crannies in the plastic portion of the feeder. I was never completely satisfied that I had cleaned it thoroughly because of its design."
5,Perfect,"The hummers LOVE this feeder. It took all of 5mins for a hummer to find and begin defending this feeder. I purchased two, and I couldn't be happier. Keep in mind, like ALL gravity feeders, when it gets HOT they will heat up and bubble out the feeding ports, leaking to the ground. What I do is hang my saucer style feeders during the day, and when the heat subsides, hang these bad boys up an watch the show. Matter of fact, I'm about to go watch the hummers right now!"
5,Best hummingbird feeder,"Best hummingbird feeder is the one, we have used others but the design of the feeder openings doesn't attached bees or ants, the perch let the birds rest while they feed. The bottom section opens for easy cleaning."
4,Just right.,"Just finished listening to the tracks, and can't say there's anything wrong with this CD. Perhaps some of the songs were repetitive, but otherwise, perfect. If you liked their previous album, ""The More Things Change"", this album will make you stoked. Highlights include ""From This Day"" which has the Biohazard-inspiried hip hop sound that Korn unfortunately made a mumbling mess out of. Forget all of that 311/Limp Bizkit nonesense; this is TRUE metal. If you dig Pantera with an industrialized sound, BUY this cd!"
5,Outstanding,"I have the previous LP's from Machine Head, which are great in and of themselves. It's great to see a band (especially a hardcore band) grow and try different approaches to their music. Most heavy bands stick with same formula, which gets boring in my opinion because it sounds the same. Kudos to Rob Flynn for trying new things and also for making leaps and bounds on his vocals. Easily the best heavy album of the year so far. Piece...."
3,"Good, but not superior to the previous albums","This cd is good, but it isn't better than Burn my Eyes, or The More Things Change... . It isn't as heavy, or as fast as their others. Robb does sound his best, but the guitar assault isn't as brutal. Highlights would be ""Exhale the Vile"" and ""Devil with a Kings Card"" (the latter is about the departure of Logan Mader). The album sounds a little like Sevendust. Ross Robinson brings out a side of Machine Head never seen, but maybe it should have stayed out of view."
4,different but good,Ive been a MachineHead fan since the release of Burn My Eyesand I have to say this cd is not really anything like that one.This one has some added features such as the use of rap on Desire to Fire or soft melodic parts.The opening to From This Day remimnded me of South Of Heaven but other than that this is a great release that all fans of bands like Deftones or Korn from their hayday.
3,"Heavy, very heavy.",L.A.'s horn-mad speed-metal Goliaths make those fellas in Limp Bizkit look about as dangerous as the Backstreet Boys. Bullet-train guitars ... throat-shredding vocals ... pure catharsis.
2,disappointing,"i love machine head but not the latest cd, i anxiously awaited the release, i have to tell you. i cant get into MHs new direction. the rap and roll does not make it, rage and the chilli peppers have that market, machine head needs to get back to their heavy a** kicking roots. lets hope this is just a bump in the road not the demise of a great band"
4,"Amazing Drumming, Excellent, Heavy, Melodic, Some Rap & Alt.","MH have changed some by incorporating Rap and Alt. Metal into their ultra-heavy, downtuned Thrash but they still sound like MH. You won't be dissapointed with this album. BUY IT NOW. Five has to be one of the best Metal songs ever."
5,simply great,"One of the best written libertarian novels, as well as amazingly well written and entertaining science fiction .A must read"
3,"Fun, but kind of all over the place","The crux of the book is that the east coast syndic (short for syndicate) creates utopia. But there is trouble in paradise as two young syndic double agents encounter the evil US Government in exile and the Chicago based Mob that controls Western North America.Some interesting ideas pop up, but the book is unevenly paced and the characters are a little bit under-developed. And it gets darn right preachy at the end.Still, it was worth the dollar I plunked down at the used book store."
3,awful...,"The songs on this album dont appear to be well structured. I was expecting to hear a huge blend of wordly soundscapes but thats a far cry from this work. Not many of the songs showcase Peter's voice either. All this is really is droning eastern background music with Peter singing on top. Of course Peter Murphy fans give this 5 stars, they think its amazing and original. This is flat out poorly done Eastern music. And an overall dismal performance by PM."
1,"Dust, or Dud?","""Dust"" is an appropriate name for this Peter Murphy album because that is what it has been collecting since I bought it. C'mon! This is the same guy that brought us Bauhaus and such classic albums as ""Love Hysteria"" and ""Cascade""? This sounds more like background music you hear at a Middle Eastern cocktail party. Unimpressive and thoroughly disappointing."
2,This isn't your older brother's Peter Murphy,"Wow. A lot has changed for Peter Murphy since his last release, Cascade. And it hasn't changed for the better. You can't blame Peter for branching out and trying to make his music sound different. But as others have mentioned, the ""world music"" sound and Peter Murphy's voice just don't mix. Most of the song's sound the same and they're very bleak and void of any melody. If you want a great Peter Murphy album try Cascade or Deep."
2,Its Hard to Listen To...,"I've been a Bauhaus - Murphy - Love& Rockets - David J. - Daniel Ash fan for a long time, Murphy being my favorite of the group. However, this is the worst album out of the lot. Maybe my aesthetic sensibilities are too narrow to see the brillance other reviewers see - but I found the album, despite its experimental nature, a meandering bore. With difficulty, I've gotten through it several times and not a single track attracts me. While I don't want to see Peter making the same album every couple of years - the leap from Cascade to Dust was too great for me. Other than his characteristic vocals, there was nothing to remind me that this was the ""Murphy Music"" that I cherish in Love Hysteria, Deep and, to a lesser extent, Holy Smoke and Cascade. I can't even recommend it to ""hard core"" Murphy fans."
5,Deep in Dust,"Each song was a fresh bouquet of sound, each song a new flower. Evocative, rich sound. Mediterranean feel. His voice is an instrument of luminescent spirit and soul. I liked the redone ""My Last Two Weeks""I don't write these things that often, but brilliance and talent must be talked about and rewarded. Welcome back P. Murphy. I've missed you! Buy this CD.The glossy paper and photo design on CD jacket was a nice touch too."
3,hey,the headphones looked okhay but when i plugged the outlet into my phone the right side would not sound and the bass is poor ..
3,"Cord is very thin, looks cheap, sound is decent","I'd say go to Walmart and get a pair of similar headphones made by Sony instead, it's worth the extra $5-10. These look very cheap, the cord is very thin and looks like it could be broken easily.The in-line volume control is nice, but mostly useless as the cord is only 9 feet long.They are pretty comfortable and light-weight. The sound is acceptable, it gets decently loud as well. I can tolerate these and will keep them until they break, but next time I will pay a little more for much higher quality. Don't pay more than $15 for these."
4,K.M Acevedo,I'm very happy with this product. You get your money worth with these headphones. Received very quick also. Will do business again.
1,broken,i brought this as a present for a young man for his birthday and he was very excited but they were broken from the start. Not a good birthday
2,Poor Sound Quality From Panasonic!,"I've had good experienced with Panasonic over ear headphones in the past, not so with this set. I was actually excited to open the package and try out the headphones but the excitement ended there. I am very disappointed with the sound quality of these headphones, barely and bass, clarity was good but overall sound was poor. I thought it was just my mp3 player so I tried it on my laptop and the sound did get a little better once I tweaked with the equalizer but far from my last pair of Panasonic headphones. Maybe it's just this model but it leaves me a little hesitant to look at another pair of Panasonic headphones. I am returning it and will be shopping for another set of headphones."
3,nice case but has a strong adhesive smell that is nauseating,"I ordered this for my husband and when it arrived we were pleased until we opened it and were nearly knocked over by the strong smell of some sort of adhesive or chemical smell of the carpet I am not sure. We put it in the garage for a day to see if we could get rid of the smell. Left it out in the fresh air all day today still smells like something you should not be inhaling. If we can not get the smell out it will be going back as I will not have this thing in the house, it does not smell like something that is healthy to be inhaling. Gross"
3,Excellent photography but repititious.,It is excellent on Blu Ray. Can't say enough about the quality on Blu Ray and a bigger screen. I was a little dissapointed in the content. Alot of it was repititious. We have planet earth and there is not much repeating. They could have gone a little more in depth about Siberia. I would recommend but only at a good price. I bought it used so it was cheaper. As always their photography is incredible.

4,"As another reviewer said, missing some critical songs","I love the songs that are on here, but as the other reviewer said, a few key ones are glaringly missing. Other than that, great cd."
3,This item is OKAY...,"This soundtrack has many great songs, but some of them aren't that great. It doesn't really match the movie, which is like 5 times better than this soundtrack. I give it an average of 3 stars."
3,should have two,I liked the soundtrack a lot but it would be better if they would have put all the song that were on the movie on the soundtrack. There were a lot of good songs that they left out. They should make a secong cd with the rest of the sonngd on it.
4,sunshine on my window makes me happy like i should be.,"okay, im sure someone in all 247 reviews was able to inform everyone of the song and artist that sang that particular song...but just incase:its called ""Calypso"" and its by an Australian group called Spiderbait. many have credited Letters to Cleo for this song but its not them. it is in fact Spiderbait.i was really dissappointed that it wasnt on the soundtrack.i thought for sure it would be."
3,1 thing I hate about you,"The CD is in great condition, just as advertised and it arrived pretty much when I expected it to. The only thing I have to say that's negative has nothing to do with the seller. The quality of the CD (sound quality so nothing to do with scratches or anything) just isn't there. Probably because this is an older soundtrack. Still like it though."
2,Two important songs missing!!!,"Okay, I loved the movie (and loved the music even more, actually), but two very important songs are missing! That's why I didn't even bother buying the soundtrack, although I listened to the CD a couple of times in the store. The two songs are: 1) One Week (Remix), by Barenaked Ladies and 2) Hypnotize, by Notorious Big. Instead of purchasing the soundtrack, I got myself each individual CD containing these great songs!!! Also, the score in the movie by Richard Gibbs is simply amazing! Unfortunately, the last track on the OST didn't include any of the great stuff. :("
4,Why?,"I thought the c.d was excelent and def. worth buying, but why wasn't Heath Ledger on it singing ""I love you baby, and if it's quite alright....."" It was one of the best tracks in the whole film and I think it would have made a great bonus track! Otherwise all the rest of the tracks were cool, I love Atomic Dog, and Save Ferris and LTC are brilliant bands, the c.d makes you wan't to buy their other stuff!"
4,Awesome Music,"Just an FYI to the person below me, it wasn't Gwen Stefani who walked down from the stage during the dance scene, it was the lead singer of Letters To Cleo, dimwit.I think the songs on this CD are great, although it IS missing the song that Stiles danced to on the table. I L.O.V.E. Sister Hazel. Awesome!"
3,Where are the other songs?,"This CD is good, but would be heaps better if it included all the songs from the movie, and took out ones that aren't in the movie. The best song in the world is Caylpso, by Spiderbait. But a question to all the people who commented on it. It came out in 1997, and you still haven't heard it? Mabye people should start listening to Australian music more often. Start with Taxiride, cause they ROCK!"
5,Music rox!,"This soundtrack is soooo good! As soon as i saw the film i wanted it! It is full of really cool songs by sum bands that ya know, and sum that ya don't, but even so, you'll like em all by the end of it! if you liked the film, you'll LOVE this!"
5,The Soundtrack of the Times!,"This soundtrack includes songs that really capture generation X's need to be different and cool. If you listen close to the lyrics, you understand that they do apply to teenagers in this day and age. And that's why it's such a great collection of up-beat songs. Teenagers can really identify with it. There's a certain connection with what's being said that really attracks attention, for any generation for that matter. I would definently recommend this soundtrack. If you're looking for new and different music that really applies to what's going on in the world today (and that has a profound influence on teenagers for the most part), this is the soundtrack for you!"
3,There needs to be a Volume 2!!! Only 3 good songs on it now.,"I love the two by 'cleo' and ""the weakness in me,"" as well as 1-2 others, but still, upon a second viewing of this fun and sweet little movie I am totally convinced there needs to be a Volume 2--I mean, where is Pat's stadium serenade?? Or the song from the opening credits??? Maybe, like on the second ""Romeo and Juliet"" CD, there can be some good Out-takes, like the bloopers in the credits, that was so great! More than anything, this movie deserves a Volume 2!!!! thank you."
1,Not so hot.,"This particular book was a gift for my daughter at Christmas from an Aunt. We will likely not buy these books for our children. I have read through other Olivia books at book stores and have found them to model inappropriate parent-child dialogue. In this book Olivia`s mother allows bargaining (regarding how many books will get read to Olivia at bed time). This is not how I want my child to talk to me. I was pleased to see original art used in the book. However, I would rather spend my time with my daughter reading books that model more appropriate dialogue."
1,neither I nor my son are great fans of this (tho i know we're in the minority),"I know the Olivia books are very popular, and we had one which my son liked, which is why I bought this. However I found it too disjointed (there isn't really a narrative, just a series of descriptions) and too full of sly adults' injokes to really appeal to my son. I am personally not a fan of children's books designed to appeal to adults.I know this won awards and the Olivia books have a great following, but I don;t think i will risk buying another one online."
5,GREAT PICTURES,I GOT THIS FOR MY NEICE FOR CHRISTMASAND WHEN I SAW THE PICTURES I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT!I HAVE TO SAY MY 5 YEAR OLD NEICE IS A DOG LOVER TO THE MAX!AND THERE FOR I THINK THATS WHY SHE DIDN'T GET INTO IT AS MUCH AS ANOTHER BOOK I GOT CALLED WIDGET(ABOUT A DOG). THAT SAYED I THINK IT WILL CONTINUE TO GROW ON HER LIKE IT HAS ALREADY BEEN AS HER INTEREST IN BOOKS GROWS.GREAT BOOK FOR ADULTS AS WELL AS KIDS! I ALSO LOVE THE MUSEUM ART IN THE BOOK.
5,Great Book!,"This book is wonderful and engaging! My daughter, who's name happens to be Olivia, loved it also. She received 2 copies for the holidays and didn't want to give either one up! (She later donated one to her school library) The character Olivia mirrors my daughter and her exhuberant energy. It was and is a pleasure to read this book to all 3 of my children. It will stay on our bookshelf and hopefully be read to my grandchildren in years to come."
2,not worth the price,I bought this book on kindle for my three year old. It was not worth it at all. Nothing special.
5,Olivia is the Best!,Huge fan of the books and the TV series--bought them for my daughter of the same name--she loves them as well!
4,i like it more than my 2yo!,"i think i like this more than my toddler. my 8mo really enjoys the illustrations. i get a kick out of reading it, and as my toddler is in the 8 outfits/day phase, she'll appreciate it more very soon."
5,SUPERIOR,"This is the most fantasically, incredible book. I have bi-polar disorder and the joke ok my house is Olivia is a BP pig! This was so great!!! LOVED the Jackson Pollack impersonation!"
5,"Clever, intelligent, humorous, and delightful.","I had always thought this book looked ""cute"" based on the cover, but didn't pick it up for ages. Now I have a copy and am amazed at the intelligence and clever detail exhibited in the artwork. Falconer conveys emotions with very few lines. I love the 2-page spread that features Olivia trying on all her clothes. In the lower-left corner, Olivia is trying on pantyhose -- and her entire body is crammed into one leg. I didn't even notice that little detail until my second or third time through the book. I'm an adult with no children, but this book was nonetheless worth every penny to me."
5,if only i knew abou this bottle 3 years ago...,"I used this bottle when weaning my daughter #3 off the breast. She had been breast feeding for 10 months, when I decided it was time for her to bottle feed. I had avoided bottle feeding for a while with her b/c with my other two I always had problems with leaky bottles. I spent lots of money on avent, green to grow, think baby, and other ""leak proof"" bottles, but they always leaked milk all over my baby. So, I took a chance and ordered this very inexpensive bottle, skeptically, and to my suprise, my 10 month old took to the small nipple wonderfully, and alas! no leaks!! This bottle absolutly DOES NOT LEAK!! In my opinion, it's the full package: inexpensive, BPA free, and wont leak. I highly reccommend this bottle for parents who are tired of watching half their pumped milk spilt all over a onsie with a still hungry kid."
4,lovely and flexible,"I bought this for someone but found myself in a pinch so ended up using it...and use it often! It's not a large piece but perfect for a smaller dinner (4-8 folks) or on the buffet table. Its style blends well with casual as well as more formal settings. Also, the casserole bowl doesn't have the typical look of something having a lid so it doubles well as a serving bowl.One minor negative...the glass cover has more of a pyrex-type look than something belonging to a Lenox piece."
5,best men rules especially dean cain,"what can i say, the movie is great better than some ones i've seen. I bought the video from here before i've seen it since it had dean in it and the video's worth all the money if you like a bit of action,comedy,and a bit of romance this movie's for you"
3,Okay book if you've already decided on a business area,"This is an okay book if you've already figured out the business side of building a catalog business, which I would argue is actually extremely important. This book is more implementation oriented with good color examples of other catalogs. It's more about the production of the catalog which I think is more intuitive. The challenge is finding a new business area that can be profitable."
4,"Easy read book filled with wit, wisdom and stark realities","Sunny Daze: The Humorous Misadventures of a Tropical Island Mom captures the everyday joy and horrors of not only island life, but the life of chaotic situation and harried parents everywhere.This book is proof that humor will see you through the most trying of situation and sometime in life all you can do is laugh,Faith Foyil is a very talented writer and this book will having you smiling and laughing out loud from beginning to end."
4,Great for the history and radio sound,"Not the CD you want if you're looking for a compilation of the best-known Glenn Miller favorites. But with the live sound and radio announcer commentary, this CD takes you right into the world of my mother and her college friends when they went to Glen Island Casino to dance and listen to one of the best up-and-coming bands of the Big Band era. The signature Moonlight Serenade opens and closes the CD and gets you ""In the Mood""--just wish the wonderful theme song cuts weren't so short."
4,"Inexpensive, Efficient, and Easy to Install","Well within the capability of an average do-it-yourselfer (especially one with a second pair of hands to hold the thing in place), this is versatile little unit. It includes adapters for vented or non-vented installations. Relatively quiet, moves a lot of air with its two speeds, has a light, and is very little more difficult to install than a new light fixture. In fact, removing the old fixture took longer than installing the new one (not to mention the fact that the new one had considerably less yuck factor!). Recommend reading the instructions all the way through before starting -- yes, husbands, this means YOU."
5,Range hood,"This hood replaced our OLD, original hood. It is inexpensive and looks nice, and the bulb will be easy to change when needed - has easy access. I would recommend this to anyone."
4,Exactly what was advertised,The unit arrived on time and was exactly as described. The best thing is that you can buy an accessory that changes the unit from a hard wire to a plug in.
1,he's not what he used to be,"I'm a real Luke Slater fan, I even follow him to parties across europe when he's playing at it, with absolute highlite ""Dance Terminal"" 1999 in Antwerpen, Belgium.I even love his cd's Wireless and Freek Funk, but this latest fabrication is really bad.Alright On Top reminds me of a poor Marc Almond album, it is very soft in every way, very very booring, it's hardly dance music. Don't buy this album, just buy Wireless or Freek Funk, that you will enjoy."
5,"Fresh, Finally!","When I was given this book from my boss, I began reading with no expectations. When I finished, I remember thinking, ""Here is the book I've been looking for"". It puts very simply and practically the basic concept of putting people as your first priority. This is a life book, as much as it is a book for business practices. Then you can watch your business grow, and sleep tight at night, knowing you're doing what you're doing for the right reasons, with no regrets. In business, and in life."
4,Black Champagne,"They say you can't judge a book by its cover, but in the case of Luna's Romantica, there's evidence that you can. Great looking cd case that really gets you ready for what you are going to hear on the album: a number of dreamy, etherial, feel good songs. In thier first studio album release in 3 years, Luna follows up ""The Days of our Nights"" with a gem. Right from the first track you'll know that you made the right decision to add this one to your collection. My picks for best songs: ""Lovedust,"" Black Champagne,"" and ""Swedish Fish."" This is the first album that showcases the addition of the group's newest member, european uber-goddess Britta Phillips....in the immortal words of my friend Bopper, ""Britta, one kiss!"" Next time you're at the record store, pick this one up, you won't be dissapointed...Rooster!"
1,Could not finish.,"Qfwfqu, an immortal being, guides the reader through the evolution of Earth. Highly repetetive with no character action."
3,Another rare Penn Central book...,"Bob Pennisi did a great job with his Penn Central book for his series on the Northeast Railroad Scene. The inclusion of some pre-merger NYC and PRR photos added to the historical feel of the book. The photography wasn't as good as some found in the Morning Sun books, but it provided a lot of rare shots that aren't found anywhere else. I would have prefered more color photography other than just on the front and back covers."
1,Won't Get Fooled Again - Yeah Right,"I'll have to admit that I bought this little piece of cheesecake because it was only $3.33 and the good looking little Brit lasse on the cover was showing off some of her handsome flesh. But what I got was the most depressing and sordid life story of a supposed real life English prostitute. The film made an attempt to give a sympathetic late 20th century presentation of her life. But I saw through it and believe me I didn't sympathize at all! I found the lead character to be the most unpleasant, disfunctional mess of a human being that no one would ever want to encounter. I could only sympathize with her father and a host of her victims whom the film went to pains to discredit. So much for late century revisionism. I was forced by Amazon's rating system to give at least one star but if I had a choice I wouldn't give it any at all. Oh, and the cheesecake rating on this film is very low. Go buy something from Something Weird Video instead."
1,Wow -only if you want your kids brought up with a 50's education,I think the title says it all. I wanted a good homeschool grammar book and this is definately not it.
5,Handy,"This was by far my most prized book. It's awfully handy to have, just in case you want to read up on the next play at the local Shakespeare festival before attending. Wallah, there it is. So what if it might break your toe if you dropped it. Mine was destroyed by a mold attack in a basement it was stored in. Huge loss for me. Hopefully you'll treat yours better."
3,A little too much beat to overcompensate for the cheesiness,"The title in this review pretty much says it. Not to be too hard on this album, but after hearing the first two from Informatik this is not what I expected. It's not a terrible album, but it doesn't have that dark uniqueness demonstrated in the previous two. It just has more upbeat dancefloor oriented songs. I guess I just expected something a little darker and more original to come from Informatik instead of ""VNV Nation/Fictional"" type pick-me-up dance songs."
4,vacuum bags,these vacuum cleaner bags were much less expensive and arrived quicklyand I would order again.
4,Vacuum Bags,"As Advertised, Well Packaged, Quick DeliveryRiccar 2000, 4000 and Simplicity 5000, 6000 Type A Vacuum Bags Microfiltration with Closure - 6 Pack"
2,Fine while it lasted,"I have two of these, purchased a little over a year ago. Both of them just died. It seems to be the power supplies, but they each behave somewhat differently. In any case, I'm buying a SATA to USB dock to see if I can get the data off. I'm not likely to buy anything like these again.Update: 3 of the 4 internal drives (there are two 500GB drives in each unit) were bad."
1,don't buy this drive.,"I have four of these drives, designed to replace a bunch of older external drives; the first three work great, but the fourth, an newest ( less than a month old) just crashed, along with a 100 meg of files...Amazon says they will replace the drive if Iomega does not solve the problem, but the telephone numbers they list are no good.If one out of four is good enough for your, then go ahead...But that is not a good record for me.A month later, another drive is going South, no customer support, and too late to return it to Amazon."
2,DVD purchase,This title does not rage. The story takes on a dream-like quality to portray the strength of the lust and confusion within the young character. It never realized what it was attempting and could have become.
1,Very Disappointing Movie,"I had high hopes & expectations from this movie, which were largely based on other reviews. I look for the following 4 qualities in a movie to be rated by me: substantial script, great acting, solid directing, & efficient editing. This movie has a disposable script, next to zero directing and probably zero editing also. The 2 (actually 3) lead characters show some reasonable acting abilities.You will miss nothing if you never watch this movie."
3,A Rocky Road to hoe ...,"I started viewing this film with no particular preconceptions, but I got restive after the first hour, then another hour went by, then I thought the film had finished but then it got a second wind, became suspiciously metaphysical, and finally ended after 3 hours and 12 minutes. I was exhausted and in a torpor - what was the point of all this Castaneda inspired nonsense? It occurred to me that the film should have been divided into two - the banal first part, which runs nearly 2 hours, and then the metaphysical second part, which could be a sequel running 70 minutes or so, and containing some extraordinary geological features and special effects, easily the most interesting components of this curious film."
2,"Bad movie, nothing to do with the seller.","It's over 3 hours long, black and white. I loved the nudity in it, but found myself falling asleep. It's extremely boring."
2,"To each his own, I guess...","Wow, after reading some of the great reviews for this, I feel like I was watching a different movie. I found little of value about this movie. Yes it is colorful. The little red monster is cute. That's about all I can say that's positive about this. I personally found all the main characters to be completely unlikable, especially the dad. This movie simply has no soul. I guess really young kids who aren't choosy would sit through it, but that's about it. I suggest renting it first before you buy this one."
2,Very Weak Disney Film!,"Let me say this from the begining, kids will love this film. They'll enjoy the cute and cuddly chick who wants to be loved and appreciated. However, some people will be perplexed by the storyline. I felt the premise of the story was too long. There's only so much you can do with a small story and it showed with the inclusion of space aliens. I also wasn't impressed by a few characters. One character I realy was annoyed at was the pig. I felt he was out of place and not funny at all. Despite the shortcomings, your kids will enjoy the film, adults will be disappointed."
3,It's alright but not expect in that!,Generally a good film for all ages! I saw it as a spoof of _war of the worlds_ Which is my fav! Recommend this movie!say it is is alright! But could of asked for more!
3,A cute and enjoyable movie,"Chicken Little is a funny movie. It's one of Disney's first computer animated movies(not counting the Pixar films) The music is good. Chicken Little's friends are funny and enjoyable, especially Runt and Fish.Chicken Little has things other animated films of today lack. For one thing the movie is about a child. Another thing it has details seen in classic cartoons. It also shows what a child feels about his father. (Unlike Finding Nemo where it's the other way around)Chicken Little is a great family film. The father son story is touching. The townspeople are cute, especially Mayor Turkey Lurkey(Don Knotts last role ever) The sci-fi story was not overwhelming. The only real disapointment is there isn't enought LOL humor in it. It's probaly a good enough movie that there will be a ride at one of the Disney Parks based on it."
2,Unwatchable,"This movie came highly recommended to me and my family. We shut it off after 25 minutes, collectively bored and unhooked. I, myself, was quite irritated with the voices. The animation was incredible, and very creative. There were a lot of cool ideas going on in the town. However, as I mentioned before, the voices were very annoying. It didn't make sense. The animal children had voices of adults. ANd the father of Chicken Little had the voice of an extremely elderly man. It didn't make any sense. My daughter was bored and asking for the ""Witch Movie"" aka ""The Wizard of Oz"" so we gladly put that on for her. Imagine that, a toddler today wanting a movie from 1939 instead of this. That says something. There are some cute and fun parts to this movie, however overall it just doesn't hold the interest of a child or an adult. The action sequences were so boring we fast forwarded through them. Imagine that. The animation is good, the story and characters are bad."
4,"lighten up folks, it is a movie for kids",I took my four year old grandson to see this movie. He liked it. I liked it. It has enough action to keep a little one interested. It has enough interesting dialogue that I wasn't bored. I think it was a good movie for young children.I do not support movies intended for kids which are mean spirited and violent. I would not recommend a movie for young children that had violence in it. This movie was fine. Watch it with your little ones and smile and sing.
1,Chicken Little Falls Flat,The movie is boring. Not done in the Walt Disney tradition. Bambi is a classic movie where actual children voices (not actors) portrayed the young animals. Chicken little voice was of an adult and not of a child. Walt Disney if he were alive would not approve.
2,Substitute,What I really wanted was unavailable through Amazon.com so I tried this item. It was not what I really needed but I still am unable to find my original preference. Guess I will try Amazon.com again some time to see if it is there now.
2,Live in New Jersey,"I liked live in Montana better. This recording is a step above bootleg quality. The guitar music is very good (Armed and Stupid, Wipe Out, I Quit, Push the Button, Up on the Sun, Fatboy). I have never liked anything but the ""Meat Puppets II"" versions of ""Lake of Fire"" and ""Plateau"" and this record does not change that. The highlight for me is the excellent performance of ""Up on the Sun"" sans the extension and ""Wipe Out"". I like the live versions of the songs from ""Golden Lies"" better than the studio, although, I was disappointed with ""Lamp"". If you don't own the albums ""Meat Puppets II"" and ""Up on the Sun"", go buy them now."
4,More than just a music CD ...,"My wife brought me this back from Prague, and I stuck the CD in my PC, and up popped an invitation to install ""Quick Time"" which I did, and then it plays you the (very strange and surreal) video on screen as well ! Survive is a good tune - I soon worked out the chords on my guitar (DCDCAmEmDG);(AGAGAGDCBbBb) and played along.Value for money is debatable however, two virtually identical versions of the same tune, and something called The Pretty Things are Going to Hell which is hard work.Good Luck."
3,Good movie.,"I liked the action in a way, but it was a little far out. They kept going in the past of what happened at first and then switching into the present time."
3,Premium Rush,"Interesting and entertaining action of the chase of the messenger bike through heavy traffic in New York City. However, not much dialog."
3,Worst acting nominee,Goes to the villian. He reminded me of the bad guys in the kids shows I used to watch. Over-actors anonymous should be his next stop. Worth the rental though.
4,Premium Rush,I enjoyed this movie. Though some would no doubt say it is predictable. It still a movie to pass a few hours.
4,entertaining,lots of action and interesting story linekind of suspensive the acting not bad eithergood camera work on seeing how it must beto ride in the big cities
4,you will not fall asleep!,"Interesting movie, didn't like the cop as an actor, fun movie to watch and keep you on the edge of your seat"
2,Waste of money and time,I wanted to watch this movie because Joseph Gordon-Levitt was in it and that was a bad idea. I would recommend this movie to people who like bad acting (not by JGL of course) and a movie that is pure riding a bicycle. Yes that's what it was about but it was literally the entire movie. I don't know why JGL was in this because he is a great actor and a lot of movies he is in are great movies but this one was a bust.
4,"Fixed gear, steel frame, no brakes","Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a bike messenger for Security Courier in New York City and he's the best at what he does. He rides his bike (very quickly) with only one gear and no brakes.He is having girl problems (Dania Ramirez) and one day gets a call to deliver a mysterious package super fast - premium rush - to Chinatown. Trying to get the package is a nasty mean NYPD detective (Michael Shannon).Great action shots, wonderful city footage. There's not a complicated storyline but the movie is fun, fast paced, and action packed."
4,Hold on to your seats...,"This flick is sheer entertainment. Bicycle couriers; when you gotta get it there today and now. Joseph Gordon-Levitt among others,(and their stunt doubles)cycle through Manhattan with split second precision. The viewer through the eyes of Levitts character(Wilee) follows routes of anticipated disaster or escape. The chase scenes are hilarious at times but also remind us of the danger that cyclists face on NYC streets. This film uses the latest digital technology employing highlighted GPS. Premium, is the importance of the message that our hero must deliver. Rush, is get it to its' destination ASAP. Michael Shannon is deviously funny at times, but is down right ruthless as a corrupt cop. Buffed up fellow messenger cyclists, Dania Ramirez and Wole Parks are part of a love triangle of sorts with Levitt. Of the hour and thirty minutes filmed, over an hour is on bikes. Anyone remotely interested in cycling will enjoy this movie for the stunt work alone."
2,there's no rush,"Levitt and Shannon should be embarrassed to be associated with this, and I figure in time they'll admit it. It's like a Saved by The Bell movie with better production value.The story doesn't develop enough to warrant an hour and a half and the soundtrack reinforces the feeling that there's nothing new being shown. It's so corny at times you wonder if it's supposed to be an ironic spoof with Levitt doing a cheap Franco impersonation from 127 hours and Shannon coming across like a much less interesting Ray Liotta dirty cop, any one of the many he's played. And I'm a fan of the acting work of both Levitt and Shannon, most notably Shannon in Take Shelter, an all time great performance in a role tailor made for him.If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have rented, and I refuse to justify money and time spent by pretending this is anything more than garbage. What a waste."
4,Unexpected Fun,"I went into this movie with low expectations but surprisingly enjoyed it. It is a little slow in spots, but picks up at the end. The acting was mostly good. I was very impressed with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, not as much with the love interest. Both people I watched with very impressed. I doubt many kids would be interested in the movie. I would recommend it to people looking for an enjoyable way to spend an evening."
4,Great movie,I was not too excited about it based on the previews but it turned out to be really good. It's action packed with an good plot. I reccomend viewing it.
3,Fun but not amazing...,"Fun and entertaining, but a little predictable. I would have given it 3.5 stars but couldn't. Definitely a movie to rent and not buy."
2,"Poor story, cyclists may find it tolerable",very weak and predictable. Only liked it for cycling scenes but they were made for lay people. Would not recommend to anyone.
2,All he does is Ride!,"I went to go see this at the movies and I have to say that this movie was a waste of time. The entire movie is JGL on a bike trying to deliver a package. No real action, suspense, nothing. Just a man on his bike! highly wouldn't recommend to anyone."
4,New Quicksilver,"This was a good movie and moved along pretty well. It was hard for me to watch this without thinking of QuickSilver. But in this world of remaking old movies, I guess it's ok. Well worth your time to watch."
2,Virtuosity for its own sake.,"Jazz musicians have a hard enough time as it is, so I hesitate to be negative. I wasn't familiar with Bromberg, so I bought the disc on the recommendation of the sticker on the front. A number of superficial things about it put me in mind of vanity projects - the cheesy photos of Bromberg peering wistfully over the bass, the platitude about the music being from the heart, and the address for his fan club. As far as the music goes, I think Bromberg is an expert player, but to me the songs are overwrought with technique, and the bass is oppressively up front in the mix. I have other recordings where the bass player is the ""leader,"" (Paul Chambers comes to mind), but I think they're richer for their understatedness.On a final note, I have to ask one thing. Why do a lot of players like Bromberg invest in an antique bass that has taken hundreds of years to develop a mature, woody tone, and then bury that tone in that awful, rubber-bandy, pickup sound?"
4,"Nice, but big","Good quality for the price, but the wooden pendant is almost the size of the palm of my hand. I had expected it to be a little smaller. It's still a nice necklace, though."
4,Perfect for LDS couples about to get married,"This book is great for couples about to get married. Its main point is the intimate relationship between a husband and wife, but there are a lot of really good points on how to keep your marriage alive and well. I would also recommend this for parents who are looking for advice to give to their children who are about to get married and for leaders who want to give better advice to married couples."
2,"Not as good as ""And They Were Not Ashamed"" by Laura M. Brotherson","I found this to be a shorter version of ""And They Were Not Ashamed: Strenghtening Marriage through Sexual Fullfillment"" by Laura M. Brotherson. It didn't have as good incite or quotes from LDS Religious Leaders. There were some but it wasn't compelling as the other."
3,A little difficult to remove frozen pops,"This product is a bit difficult to remove frozen pops. If you soak the sticks in water ahead of time as some recommend, they end up expanding and making it difficult to remove the metal cover. I started to leave off the cover. Also, the plastic molds expand in the freezer and don't slide out of the holder unless you run them under water for a while. This starts to melt your pops before you can enjoy them. Although it is usable, I would not buy them again."
5,"A ""must"" for hot summer days","I would have rated this four stars had I not read other reviewers' tips to delay inserting sticks until the pops are partially frozen. I make fruit smoothies (usually yogurt, orange juice, berries, a banana and a peach) and fill the pop molds with part of the mixture. The pops release easily when the mold is run briefly under hot water; the pops themselves remain frozen. I ordered four more molds for my children and grandchildren."
2,"Works, but with some issues","I bought this mold years ago, and while it works, there are some definite downsides:1. If you don't put all the sticks in PERFECTLY VERTICALLY, or even if you do, and they don't STAY that way until it's frozen, then getting the lid off (and then back on again), is nearly impossible as the sticks are at different angles. I solved this by simply not using the lid at all, and letting the sticks go in at weird angles (it worked OK, just looked funny eating a crooked popsicle).2. You have to keep the entire mold in the freezer until the last popsicle is eaten, and that is both a waste of space, and lacks flexibility. Individual pop molds can be stashed wherever there is room, once they are frozen. I suppose you can remove the popsicles from the mold and store them in something else, but that's kind of a mess.I eventually replaced it with individual molds that I liked much better - Tovolo brand or something like that."
1,An interesting subject wasted by horrendous writing,"Kostova deserves credit for developing a fresh take on a subject that one would have thought cliched. However, poor character and plot development, an incongruous and amateur writing style,and too many coincidences for one plot make this reading experience thoroughly avoidable."
1,A total disappointment!!!!!,"Yet another media-hyped books which is boring, flat, self-important and a waste of $25.95."
4,Lovely for Literary Readers,"This is an amazing first book for Kostova, and I loved it. The story and details were fascinating to me, especially because Eastern Europe and the East/West connection is not a subject often found in fiction, and there was much to learn. The author has a great future if she can find a better editor to cull down some of the details that slow the plot and make the pacing uneven - my only criticism. I wouldn't want to see her trying for a DaVinci Code style - she's too good for that - but her writing could stand some fairly serious editing.Having said that, the reviews here which call the book ""dull"" and ""too slow"" and ""boring"" baffle me no end. True, the pacing is slower than a traditional thriller, but it isn't a traditional thriller. While it's true that some of the more obscure detailing needs cutting, I believe those who weren't fascinated by the book either lack generic curiosity, or were looking for another DaVinci Code."
1,Not the worst book I've read but it comes close,"The mystery for me was not in the book but in the question, how did it become a bestseller? The writing was amateurish, the story line almost non existent, the time line confusing and the descriptions too lengthy. Where was the editor? Drakula must have sucked the blood out of the main characters about whom I cared not a whit. Any number of writers, without Ms. Kolstova's good fortune in having such dribble published, could give her lessons in good dialogue. Heaven knows she's needs them. Yes, some of the history and local customs of Rumania and Bulgaria were interesting but I could have gained more info on these subjects in a non-fiction, probably better written book. Editing down to 200 - 250 pages might have made a better, more exciting book but 642 pages are 400 too many. I'm glad I borrowed it from a library rather than wasting my $'s on this disappointing work. Sorry, Miss Kostova."
2,Didn't finish it,"First a caveat: I did not finish this book. Normally, I'll give a book at least a hundred pages to hook me before giving up on it. In this case, because I really wanted to like ""The Historian,"" I gave it almost two hundred pages before giving up. Eventually the slow pace, the coincidences, and the so-so writing style just piled up too high, and I put it back on the shelf. The novel's premise sounded great, but the author just didn't deliver, at least not enough to engage me enough to read the entire book."
3,"Slow pace, but good travel log","It starts out well but quickly loses steam. By the time our protagonists discover yet another cache of secret correspondence, I had lost patience. Enough already! How about some writing in the present tense instead of asking us to jump between three different correspondents? Anyway, the descriptions of the exotic locales was very interesting. But Dracula did not come across as very menacing. I know this is supposed to be a literary DaVinci Code, but c'mon . . . a little blood and action would have helped tremendously. After all, he is a VAMPIRE! It was interesting enough where I read it in three days, but definitely not as well paced as DaVinci Code."
1,Even the abridgement is a yawner; narrative ooze rather than drive,You might like this if you did not know that Muslims and Christians fought for centuries through the Balkans. But you would also need to be fascinated by silly characters plodding towards a nothing climax.No matter how much the publisher hypes this book it amounts to faux literature and fizzled pulp.
1,A Truly Terrible Book,"This book looked to be an interesting perspective on an old story. Instead it was a long and uninteresting perspective. Wordy and confusing (flashbacks in flashbacks in flashbacks), the author does not have the skill or the imagination to even begin to make an appealing story. Like some other reviewers here, I forced myself to finish this book - mainly to see if somehow it could redeem itself. It did not and in fact the ending was even less than I expected - and I wasn't expecting much.The quote that came mind while reading this book is attributed to Mark Twain (though I think this is incorrect). Something like ""If I had more time I would write a shorter letter."" Kostova didn't have time to write a shorter book and it shows.The one good thing about The Historian was that the characters were likable. But I would have liked them more if they appeared in a much shorter and more interesting book."
3,"Wonderful history and writing, let-down wrap-up ending","I agree with all the reviews that this book is beautifully written. And frankly reading it was truly enjoyable (except for some letters that put me in a coma). But the ending just wraps up suddenly, inexplicably, boom book over - without answering so many questions like where was Dracula buried, was his head buried separately, what was the purpose of the empty-page books, how exactly did Helen decide to reunite with her daughter 15 years later and end up in the right place at the right time? Where did Mr. James come from (who I couldn't even remember who the heck he was)? the history was beautiful, but too many buts... what happened to Helen's mother? Did Paul's daughter have a dragon on her shoulder too? Did she marry Barley?"
1,So long and boring,"This book was recommended to me by a good, trusted friend. It is the worst book I have read in ages. It was very long without enough story to fill its abundant pages. I finished it--though, I'll admit to having skimmed the last hundred pages. I was so relieved when it was over--not the right feeling to have when you've just read a book."
4,Great historical fiction,"This book sucked me in (pun unintended) for the 2 weeks it took me to read it. Kostova's extensive historical research shines through in a very believable story surrounding the mysteries and tragedies of Vlad the Impaler (Dracula). I loved the parallel story lines. Creepy at times, but overall an amazing book and one that I will remember for a long time."
3,Kinda boring,"**spoiler alert**This book had beautifully descriptive language but I found the actual story to be tedious and boring. Most of the time I felt like I was reading a European history textbook. I read entire pages and realized after reading them that I had retained nothing (just like in college!)The present day Dracula is a wimp compared to his 15th century self. He's looking for someone to catalog his library?? How sinister! I was also bothered by the liberties taken with vampire mythology with out much explanation, for example why is it that Dracula can go out in during the day now? I felt like there were too many holes within the vampire parts of the story and those were the parts that I was most interested in. I'm torn between giving the book 2 or 3 stars but I'm going with 3 because 1) if you are a history buff, you may enjoy this book more than I did and 2) it is well-written for the most part."
2,"Nice history lessons, but storyline and characters feel forced","Its certainly interesting to learn about esoteric topics of history: who would not agree? But the question here is ""is this a good novel?"". I think that most people who are really familiar with good writing will have to say no.The characters seem to be pasted into the story in an artificial way, rather than fitting in naturally. They appear at all-too convenient moments, and one gets the feeling that one must force oneself to accept them.There just is not a good flow to this narrative."
1,Painful at best,"I must say I was intrigued at first by the History, Dracula and the Characters. But, after 250 pages, I was done. The author just goes on and on. We never really do get a good story line on the Dracula character, not even at the bitter end. If I still had my receipt, I would try and return this book for a full refund."
3,Please enter a title for your review,a sporadically engaging story weighed down with irrelevant detours. i thought i could make it through but wound up skipping most of pages 430-550. my advice is don't bother.
1,Epic snoozer,"The only thing keeping me turning the pages was the hope that the story would get somewhat interesting. The characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting. Dracula himself was about as charismatic as an overripe banana. No one in the story had any real motivation, so their musings were pointless and banal. The concept of letters furthering the narrative is great, but when you have letters inside of letters, inside of recollections it becomes very tedious. The denouement was an enormous disappointment - brief and very unsatifying. I wish I hadn't bothered to pick up this book."
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,"I have to admit, it took some will power for me to read yet another book about Dracula. And when I'd finished it, I knew why. For one thing, the Dracula in this novel just isn't as big a personality as I'd hoped he'd be when he finally appeared, which is many hundred pages in. Beyond that, I found the layers of narration -- from several people, at least a generation apart -- more confusing than effective. I kept trying to like the novel more than I did, but in the end, I finished it more out of a sense of duty than because it held my attention."
4,"Good, but I wonder...","The first vampire novel I've read in years. Yet I wonder about the Prince-Vlad III Dracula. Why did his father send him to the Sultan's court; was Prince Vlad evil-or a warrior? He made peace with the man responsible for his father's death. Why? What motivated him to take up arms against the Turk- to hurl the vile Sultan Mehmed out of Wallachia? What was his first wife truly like, did he love her-did he weep when she perished? What pulsed through his veins as he fought tirelessly for his realm, his honor-his people? Why did King Matthias Corvinus betray him? And who killed him? That would be a novel I would like to read. And one that is coming, my friends, doubt that not!"
3,About 300 pages tooooo long!,Many times I contemplated just giving up on this book. I did finish it and was glad that I did...but it was painfully hard to muddle through parts of it.
2,Deus ex machina,"Disappointing. Although the book is well paced, easily readable and indeed, does have a tremendous historical information centered around historical eastern Europe, as a reader, I just cant get over the ending. After 642 pages, a more well reasoned ending should have been developed."
4,A page-turner,"The writing was very good and the intertwined stories were compellingly recounted. I had a hard time putting it down. That said, it did stretch credulity quite a bit, particularly during the last 20 or 30 percent of the book."
2,WORDY!,"I have never read a book so ""wordy"" in my life. The story seemed so promising but it just got bogged down in descriptions. We read this story for my book club and the general consensus was that the book was just too wordy. We liked a lot of the characters but their personalities seemed to get lost in the background descriptions. I was hoping for a much more entertaining and thought provoking story. I am glad I was able to sell it used the day after I finished it since it is a book that I wouldn't ever opt to read again!!!!"
1,Could have been a short story,"I just finished The Historian and am sorry I wasted so much time reading it. The book is far too long and plodding and not one scene really gripped me. Kostova's writing is pretty amateurish, in my opinion (how many times did I read about ""bright eyes"", ""looked at hard"" etc.). You don't feel as if you get to know what any of the characters are really like and the long passages of letters drags. Sometimes when describing scenery or bringing in some history, the book perks up. But by and large what a huge letdown. I really don't understand the popularity. EK should be ashamed at disappointing readers like this!"
3,The Historian,I was going to Turkey on vacation and was told this was a good book to read. It is more about vampires that Istanbul but it was a good read. If you like vampires you would love it.
3,Not as good as the author's next novel,"Having thoroughly enjoyed this author's second novel, The Swan Thieves, I looked forward to reading her first. The Historian displays the author's talent for creating interesting characters with complex relationships, and it is a fine travelogue of eastern Europe. Its subject matter is a little tedious, however. Even so, it is a worthwhile read. But for an extraordinary story, compellingly told, read The Swan Thieves. Having produced a first novel with an ancient book as the focal point, and a second with a fine painting as the focus, one can only wonder whether the author's third novel will involve a musical composition."
2,This book is losing me...,"I'm am not an experct literary critic by any means. All I can tell you is that this book is about 300 pages TOO LONG. I'm about 1/2 through the book and I don't think I have the attention span to finish it. I'm disappointed because I love the history of Dracula and vampires. I really want to know what happens in the end, but getting there seems impossible. Don't try this one if you are a slow reader like me :("
5,Word Spa!,"This book is wordy but beautifully so. Kostova lulls you with calm, descriptive passages -- like a travelogue -- then ping!, zaps you with a juicy pinprick. She does this again and again to delicious effect. A great book to slink down into a jacuzzi with and be bathed by words. However, probably not your read if you want a quickie."
5,Brilliant,"I was completely blown away by this novel. I expected it to be good, and couldn't wait to read it, but I never thought it would be this good.So well written, it is a ""road-movie"" through Europe, Amstersdam, France, Italy, Greece, Istanbul, Sofia and countryside Bulgaria, Budapest in Hungary, Romania, a story so enthralling that you can't leave the book. I sure believe anyone interested in history should read it, and for those who love vampire stories, this is a feast!"
5,Awesome Read,This one stands with the best. Move over Bram Stoker. The Historian will become a classic vampire thriller.
3,Like half and half,"I call ""The Historian"" half and half simply because it's half of everything. It's half catchy, half boring. Half confusing, half easy read. Overall, it's not half bad for a first novel."
1,Zzzzzz....,"This is the last time I purchase a book based on hype...from the publisher and author no less. The review had the author recalling how she had to close the blinds while writing after sundown because she was so frightened and the fact that the publisher fronted a hefty sum. That statement coupled with the fact that Kostova had researched the <ahem> haunts where the *real* Dracula lived caused me to purchase as soon as it was released. Now I only wish I had been wearing a strand of garlic to keep from purchasing this sleeper in the first place.One reviewer said one had to intellect and depth to appreciate the novel. Bolderdash I say. Remember the story of how everyone who was anyone admired the emporer's new clothes? Hype notwithstanding, I say he's just nekkid."
1,I want my money back,"After trying to force myself to read this (mainly because I didn't want the money I spent to be a total loss), I've given up at approximately the half way mark.The success of this book speaks volumes to the effectiveness of marketing in place of quality.If you like boring first-person narrative with a lot of yak-yak-yak interspersed with the occasional appearance of a rather tame neck-biting librarian, this book is for you. I really wanted to like this book and am sorely disappointed as a result. If you must read it then get on the waiting list at your local library and save your money for something worth while. This book sucks."
1,Very disappointed,"I was very excited to purchase and read this book, however, once I did I was very disappointed. The book is very confusing constantly jumping from one character to another. I found myself wondering who was speaking - father or daughter. Also, I think this book of 600 and some pages could have been completed in say 350 pages. Very, very wordy. I do not think I would read another of this author's works."
1,"Over hyped, overwritten - a Big Bore","I am a quarter through the book and still there is little story, just endless description of places and long-winded letters written by a self-indulgent academic. The main characters are made of cardboard. Nothing in their heads (or any other part of their anatomy) except the research. What a waste of money - and trees."
3,"Good, not great...","Though the novel takes several twists and turns it utlimately fails to capture the reader's intrigue. My main problem with the book wasn't the ending, unusual writing style (in the form of letters and journal entries), or even the mundane historical references, rather it was the lack of closure (or follow up) on some of the main characters on the plot. I can count at least 6 seperate characters that appeared at various points in the book, significantly contributed to the plot, then were never heard of again.Though the topic is interesting, and does have real historican facts, I think with the proper editing and closure it would have been a much better read and less drawn out."
3,Better written than The daVinci Code,"This book is often compared to The daVinci Code in content, however, the writing is much better. It could be recommended on those grounds alone, although it must be said that the audiences for The daVinci Code and The Historian are much different.If you've done your homework on Vlad Tepes, there is not much in this book that will surprise you. It was an enjoyable read, but no literary masterpiece."
3,long and tedious but a provocative thought or two,Read the first chapter then skip the next 200 pages to save yourself time and boredom. The voice of the characters can be confusing but the premise of the book and the recruiting of aids to the vampire are well done. There are also some provocative thoughts such as the last supper being a source of vampire ideology and that the Christian God being all merciful will forgive Lucifer at the time of resurrection.
3,Again with the vampires,"I don't generally enjoy vampire stories, so I was surprised when I enjoyed this one as much as I did. Then I got to page 672 and was reminded why I don't generally enjoy vampire stories. At the risk of spoiling the entire book, let me simply say that villains who cannot, under any circumstances, be defeated are not (to me) interesting villains. I'm not asking for a happy ending--in fact I generally prefer the opposite--but when failure is a forgone conclusion, why bother reading? I found the book much more satisfying before I read the Epilogue, and I heartily recommend that anyone in possession of a copy simply tear it out."
2,"Has potential, but needs an editor","The Historian takes a potentially interesting plot and drags and drags it out until you just have to put the book down out of boredom. I agree with the other reviewers that this book badly needed better editing, as the action could have been truly fast paced and hooking and the flashbacks would not have been that confusing and dragged out. The ending is also a bit anticlimactic, as I, for one, was expecting a vampire and ended up with a librarian. At that point I wanted to throw the book across the room. After enduring looooong (but admittedly well-written) descriptions and travels covering half of Europe and multiple people, all we get is a librarian who is biting and scaring people in order to help him with his 'collection'. Ooookay."
2,A BIG disappointment,"I fell for the hype! Shame on me!The first 100 or so pages make for a very promising start that does not deliver some 500 pages later.When I reached just under half way through the book I considered giving it away. Instead, decided to finish reading it despite my better judgement. I thought the book might ""come back to life"". I was wrong.The characters lack life :) .....or should I say the characters that were not members of the ""living dead"" have about as much personality as a zombie from a ""B"" movie."
2,a bit of a snooze,"I'd have to agree with the reviewers here that found this book miserably slow. I first I kind of enjoyed ambling along with it, (the style is a sort of modded-up, Bram Stoker-ese), fully expecting it to get going at some point. But it really doesn't, at least not by 2/3rds of the way through, when I gave up on it (Drac had still not shown up). Because it's slow you also start to notice the annoying stylistic flourishes, the endless descriptions of journeys taken and meals eaten (the only stew in this book is on the table), and the fact you are once again confusing the three different first-person narrators in three different time-frames. If you're not a fan of big, slow novels, you probably should pass this one by."
2,Very overrated. Doesn't live up to the hype.,"We're supposed to be impressed by the fact that the author spent many years researching this book. Well, that would have been impressive if this was a non fiction history book and not a novel. As it is, The Historian is one long and boring tirade of historical data that serves no purpose other than to bog down the bare bones plot and make this book twice as long as it should have been, a real editor was sorely needed.The story, regarding Dracula alive in the modern age seems to be an exciting premise, but believe me, it's been done before in many other novels and much better I might add. In fact Dracula himself makes only a brief appearance very late in the book.How this novel has become a best seller is beyond me. Perhaps it's because it's being compared to The DaVinci Code, but The Historian is nowhere near as fast paced or exciting as that book."
3,Disappointing,"Just finished reading this book and I have to say I am pretty let down. The idea of this novel had such promise but it simply failed to deliver. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was due to the research that went into developing this story line. At times, the plot picked up a little but only gave me a short taste and left me wanting more. I kept reading thinking that all of a sudden this story would just pull me in but it really never happened. Only during the last hundred or so pages did this tale become interesting."
3,Slog is the key word,"The Historian is a slog through plot with characters very similar. However, the description is worth the trip for those who read quickly and will devour (ah...) other books as well--all in the same week's worth of reading time."
3,Not really anything new,"Well, I heard the buzz and was all excited about this book. It stayed with me in the beginning and slowly died.It is well-written and well-researched, all of the information on the politics and problems of the region were interesting sidenotes. It was the story that didn't do anything for me. It reminded me a great bit of Bram Stoker's version and didn't have any 'awe factor'.Overall it passed the time but this book wasn't the experience it was promoted to be."
2,Neat story idea...way too long,"While I think the story of tracking down Dracula via clues in history and the cleaver idea that Dracula is alive and wants to protect his privacy, the author does not move the story along fast enough. The book could have been cut back by about 250 pages and would have been much better (it's over 600 pages long!).Also, for a story that describes so many interesting world places, the author never develops the knack for making the reader feel like they are at these places."
1,Not worth your time,"I typically do not write reviews, but I was so disappointed in this book and just had to write about it to save others from wasting time reading it. I read it for a book club. About 100 pages into it (out of 600 - 700 pages), I went from enjoying it to being totally bored. This could have been a good story I thought about half way through, but it was way too long and just went on with pages and pages of letters, needless descriptions. Honestly, who cares what someone ate in every cafe or what every building looked like. And, there was just too many places, tombs, maps etc to keep track of or want to care about. I wanted to finish it for my book club, but I skipped so many pages in the second half as I just couldn't stand it any longer. And, in the end, the truth is, it wasn't a good story. Boring, uneventful ending, predictable."
2,Way too long,"I agree with many of the other reviewers on two points: 1) Ms. Kostova's editors could have done a more thorough job editing her novel, and 2) The characters are superficial and insufficiently compelling to drive the story. The plot twists were predictable. The strength of the novel is its ambitious and fairly successful attempt to blend historical fact with just the right touch of fiction to engage the reader's imagination. I think that part of the difficulty is that the search for various & sundry historical documents which drive the central mystery is not terribly suspenseful because it's very distanced for the reader. You're essentially reading about someone reading/translating a document. I did come away with a much firmer grasp of Eastern European history from that era. I left wondering why I lugged such a heavy tome to and from the airport."
3,Historians vs. Vampires,"An intriguing twist on the Dracula legend, wrapped around a mini-history of the Balkans and the Ottomans. The book reads like a history book/travelogue more than is good for the narrative; while it's fascinating and well-executed, the book probably should have been shorter by at least 200 pages."
4,"Good Read, but Needed an Editor","""The Historian"" is a good read, a story well told, but over told. It needed an editor. At times, almost like reading a Thomas Wolfe epistle...good stuff, good story, good discripton, but too much of it..The length and detail, at times, detract for the story itself, which is unfortunate. A good story, extremely well written at times. When reading it alone, especially late at night, some of the discriptons, situations and story lines actually bring chills. It's that good!! But it in the end, it is too long. Far too long. The same criticism, however, could be made of any of Wolfe's beloved books, ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""Les Miserables"" and countless other ""must read"" books. Read this one on vacation--when you have plenty of time."
4,Losing A Third of the Pages Wouldnt Have Hurt,"I give this book a 3.5. I never have problems with long books. (In fact I read ""Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell--which has 200 more pages--a lot faster than I did THE HISTORIAN. I gave that a 5!)It truly has a lot of History! THere's more than enough of Wallachia, Budapest, Roumania, the Ottoman Empire and Dutch something-or-other. A little goes a long way, dude. But other than that minor quibble, I enjoyed this book . . . a mysterious book with a dragon starts several scholars (in different countries) on a quest for Dracula's grave. And apparently some of his minions are either chasing them (or helping them along) depending on whether you're undead or not. I'm a fan of eerie libraries and peculiar books and monks (plenty of monks in this tome for atmosphere) so this is good! And the Nosferatic action works too!"
2,Hard to stay awake!,"I have had this book since July and it is now November and I still haven't finished it with about 100 pages left to read. It tells a fact filled story that is slow and yet at time interesting but so much of it goes on and on and ends up nowhere. In the time that I began this book, I have read six others and then keep coming back to the Historian because I always finish a book and I hope and believe that it will end better than the last 542 pages. Mostly, it just puts me to sleep and I wake up with my face in the pages. I feel mostly upset that I waskted my gift certificate to Barnes and Noble on this book that got such rave reviews!"
1,Worth neither the time nor the effort,"I hated this book for all the same reasons as others who've hated it.The only benefit I received was when I successfully answered a Trivial Pursuit question about Constantinople, thanks to The Historian's tedious references to the city's history. Then again, maybe I have They Might Be Giants to thank for that (and they were able to enlighten me in less than 4 minutes)."
2,long and boring mostly,"it has been said before, but I will say it againthis would have made a pretty good 350-400 page novelsomewhere along page 200 it stalls out and does not pick up momentum again until the last 150 pages (650 pages total)would have stopped reading if i could have found a good chapter by chapter outline online"
1,In a word...lame.,"Although the plot is decent, this book is way too long. There are pages and pages...and pages of boring descriptions of the countryside and various buildings that do absolutely nothing to move the story along. The encounters with Dracula himself are few and far between and are not at all 'chilling' and 'spine-tingling' as I heard from others. The end is anti-climactic and I felt ripped-off after trudging through 600+ pages to get to it."
5,What a great read!!!,"I have been a long time fan of Anne Rice and have finished all of her vampire/witch books. Since then, I have been trying to find a book that would bring the world of the supernatural, as well as, the historical aspects one might find in one of Dan Brown's novels together.I found that in this altogether wonderful book it took two of my favorite things (history and the unknown) and wove them into a great tale.I look forward to her next book, I'm sure it will be a success."
2,Parts are greater than the whole.,"An interesting premise and several compelling set pieces. But overall, overly long and redundant and, sadly, predictable."
2,A 300-page book stretched for 600+ pages,This skimpy story could've been told in far fewer words and possibly held my interest. I found myself skipping through large chunks of the story to get to anything useful. The reader must often wade through 5 pages of boring narrative to get to the one small point of detail the author is trying to convey. I had to force myself to finish it.
2,A Pain in the Neck to read,"I love reading historial fiction. I am entranced by the romantacism of vampires and Draculyan legend. So, this booked seemed like a natural fit, right? The beginning certainly tantalized me; I was even captivated and intrigued by the father's haunted past. But honestly, after knocking around every dusty library and monastery in Eastern Europe, the plot seemed to spin out of control and I lost interest.I wasn't expecting lots of gore and even an ""adventurous thriller"" but a little less of a history lesson and more action would have kept my interest longer. Even Anne Rice got off to a better start than this!In separate reviews this book has been compared to DaVinci Code. Not by a long shot! At least Dan Brown got us caught up in some cloak-and-dagger.This one was kind of a let down. Not good when you're 3/4 through the book and hoping it will all be over soon."
5,Vocabularly and Word Order,"Author's vocabularly is very good, and also her word order is perfectly understandable, though her sentence is a little long."
2,ambitious but falls way short,"The story is quite interesting, and it is captivating to read some of the actual historical accounts of Vlad and how she weaves the fiction with the non-fiction. However, that is about all that's good with this book. It is poorly written and there are many, and I mean many, parts of this book that are boring, unnecesary and long. I actually stopped reading this thing with about 200 pages left, and I have never done that with any book before. I am compulsive when it comes to finishing any movie or book that I started, and this one was a first for me. I went to the last 15 pages or so just to see how she ended it all.I warn you now, don't waste your time with this one. Get the Cliff notes instead."
5,A Slow and Loving Read.,"I tend to read slowly, for pleasure, and ""The Historian"" I actually stretched to six weeks, though the book literally demands to be read in a week. It is the history of a history inside a history contained in a letter, inside another letter, and the tension and suspense mounts deliciously until it is almost too much to contain. When the villain of all villains finally appears, it is a great pay-off, it is awesome and frightening. The ending of the novel could have been corny and Aspartamed in the hands of a lesser talent, but Elizabeth Kostova magically brings her tome to a close, satisfying and perfect. I felt lost when I finished. Incredible read."
5,...with a little Dracula thrown in,"I have never been very hip with the attraction everyone has with vampires. There are many a book on the subject out there; they seem to fill an entire section of every bookstore. Just not my thing. But trusting a recommendation, I found myself burning through this book.This was a beautifully disguised history lesson with a little Dracula thrown in for a powerful kick. I enjoyed this educational thriller through all of its wonderings. I know some critics bemoan it lackadaisical coasting but it is that same leisurely pace that paints such lovely pictures and powerfully lends itself in the development of the suspense. For surly the evil darkness waits around the corner..."
4,"A Kaleidoscopic Romp through Time, Emotion and Myth","This ""thing"", Kostova's ""The Historian"", is so dense and so multidimensional that I often found myself smothered by the author's underlying and omnipresent research. At times there was an almost fatigue laden sensation of laboring through this book but the fascination and thrill of the story, the Dracula myth, the rich regional and world history and the emotive connection to the book's enormously human central characters enabled a gripping addiction that induced a maniacal reading on.And like all the best books, when I finally completed this dark and intense adventure, I felt like an era had ended. A time in the present had ironically moved instantly to ""history"". This is a unique book indeed!"
3,Too historical,The premise behind the book was exciting and held a lot of promise. But Kostova got too caught up in prolonging the suspense and layered her narrative with too many frames and perspectives from characters' accounts and letters and historical references till I got really lost... skimmed through the last 100 pages just to finally see Dracula at long last!
2,The Historian,"I got to page 97 and then went and bought the CD. I have a long drive to and from work and traffic can be a beast, so I thought listening would give me time to appreciate what I thought was going to be a great story. I thought reading nearly 100 pages would finally have grabbed my attention but no. I found the CD to be a bit more interesting and did get all the way through it but I am really glad I didn't spend my time reading the book. I usually take book critics seriously but it was way over rated."
3,Good writing...bad editting.,"The editor must have been asleep on this one. At least a third of the book could have been removed altogether which would have made it a better read. She describes everything beautifully, it is simply too much."
4,Entertainig vampire mystery,"Nice, entertaining story but Kostova tries a bit too hard with her language. Her book could be 50-75 pages shorter. Good summer reading."
1,Dull,"I purchased this book when it was first published. It was being hyped as the next ""DaVinci Code"". The author was making the morning TV rounds and I was excited to get started. However, I must say that this is one of the dullest books that I have read."
2,Herculean effort too heavy on prose,"I heaved this handsome, titanic novel off the shelf with the expectation that it would be an interesting bit of historical fiction/folklore that would provide me with a long, satisfying reading experience. All I got was ""long."" Heavy-handed, endless passages do little to either move the story along or help paint the picture of the vampire-chasers' adventures.Rather, the hundreds of descriptive pages in between plot points do little to build the suspense and one could actually forget it's conceived to be a thriller in the first place. While it is obvious that the author has a gift for language and detail, I (finally) finished this opus questioning her overall storytelling ability. Best for die-hard Drac fans, methinks."
4,The Historian,A bit ambitious but still a nice read. You need to suspend your beliefs if you intend to enjoy this novel. Nice descriptions of European travel.
1,Elizabeth Kostova is no Dan Brown,"I enjoy history and historical novels. A good plot or well developed characters in an interesting historical setting is usually enough for me to give a book a passing grade. I am not a vampire fan, but the opportunity to learn a little about Ottoman influences in eastern Europe was enough to get me to buy this book. I have learned a little about the period, but at the price of painfully weak dialog and an alarmingly unsophisticated world view. If you are under 15 and are a big Dracula fan, then this book may not dissappoint."
1,I QUIT ON PAGE 60,"I went into this book with high expectations. The conceit of the plot: that Vlad the Impaler was still alive was excellent. The idea of reading a DaVinci-style chase across Europe sounded as though it wouold be very entertaining. In reality this book moved with all the speed of paint drying on a wet, humid day. Don't believe the hype."
2,Boooring,"A lot of hype and after 100 pages I could no longer read on. If you must try this, don't waste your money on the hard cover."
2,My Dear Unfortunate Reader,"I am going to keep this review brief. I was expecting alot more from such a dynamic plot: A missing adviser caught in the mists of Dracula, Vlad the Impaler, and conspiracy. Rather I found long prose, empty characters, and overall a droll story. If anything I kept waiting for some exciting answers to arise but lost hope after 500 pages( and still a good 200 pages from the end) All culminating in sheer disappointment. If your're looking for a vampire thriller, or a look into the evil workings of medieval royalty like Vlad the Impaler, This is not your book. I do applaud Kostova in creating substantial historical context, nonetheless I was expecting a more fruitful experience."
4,Nothing like the Divinci Code,"Last night I finished reading ""The Historian"" and was very pleased overall with the novel. This novel read nothing like the Divinci code, as some people believe, and is far better written. The authors excellent verbal illustrations of the landscapes and geographics of the book were astounding. However, the ending I found to be slightly anticlimatic and basically cut short. There could of easily been another 100 pages and not even be at a slight risk of sounding long winded."
2,sloooow,"Really like the premise of this book but it just moved so slow. Actually, I still haven't finished it and probably won't. I'm a pretty avid reader, and probably could of finished it in a couple days if it were a little more interesting."
1,Very difficult to finish! :(,"I bought the book in an airport, wanting to be entertained for the whole flight. It took me months to finish because it was NOT a page turner. The whole plot was an interesting concept. B-U-T it was S--L--O--W. The characters jumped from modern day, to 1477, to 1940's, character to character, and hard to figure out whose story you were reading at the time. I really like this type of story, but it is not a book that I kept after reading it, and didn't recommend it to any of my friends."
3,TOO LONG!!!,"This is an interesting novel, with interesting characters and places... however it is too long and at times the pace is soooo slow you just want to quit. For me, the first 100 pages were a grueling trial. Once those are over it does seem to move more quickly, but still... could have been 200 pages shorter. The length of the novel trumps the fact that it is a good novel."
5,UNIQUE APPROACH TO AN OLD THEME,"I give Kostova 4 stars because she approached the dead (pardon the pun) Dracula theme in a wonderfully refreshing way. If readers are expecting Anne Rice or Bram Stoker gore, forget it. In fact, she makes mockery of the Hollywood vampire approach. Kostova thankfully doesn't focus on the vampiristic gore that flavors so many Dracula books, but rather delivers an intelligent tome which 'sucks in' and satisfies readers on ahistorical, yet suspenseful vein. I loved it and couldn't put it down! Bravo to Ms. Kostova!!"
1,"tedious, dull, interminable Vampire ripoff","I wanted to like this book, but I've invested at least a week on it and have barely made it through 100 pages. I hate to give up a book only 1/6th of the way through, but Elizabeth Kostova simply doesn't know how to write. All the key characters speak in the same overly mannered, contrived, and pedantic voice: a teenaged girl sounds identical to her middle-aged father, who sounds identical to his former university advisor. The Historian drones on and on without a trace of suspense, feeling, or excitement. This is definitely not good airplane reading."
3,It's the vampire novel that never ends...,"The characters were not very well developed though the scenery was discussed in great detail. Sometimes too much detail. It was well written but just really boring for the most part. The same old vampire cliches in a very long book. I loved the basic idea of the book, but it just never came together in an interesting way."
4,Not bad...,"""The Historian"" is a pretty good read, save for a few nit-picks. While quite an admirable start for a first time writer, Kostova resorts to a few tired cliches and strange leaps in character development at times. However, when she hits her stride, the book becomes a true page-turner. I whole-heartedly encourage anyone that likes ""DaVinci Code"" to check this one out."
1,Boring Behemoth,"Wow: this book is an abomination. Its unremitting dullness is more excruciating than a bite from the blood-thirstiest vampire. And if you're hunting for Nosferatu-esque scares, search elsewhere: The Historian is roughly as frightening as the 1995 Leslie Nielsen slapstick Dracula: Dead and Loving It. For a summer blockbuster that actually delivers on its promise for suspense, check out John Twelve Hawks' The Traveler. That book is kick-ass."
3,Good and Bad,"I must admit that when I first started the book, I couldn't put it down. At the beginning, the story moves at a pretty fast pace. Near the middle of the book, I found myself getting bored with the story. The same story kept repeating itself several times and I thought I was having deja vu over and over. Also, the historical text that the author inserts in the middle put me to sleep and I had to continue the next day. It was too long. Near the end it began to get exciting again only to have a very short and disappointing ending. I felt like I read so much story (hundreds of pages) only to have the ending over in 3 pages or so. I found the ending rather cheesy with regards to Dracula and vague with regard to the father/mother/daughter. I did enjoy the history and culture in the book- just not the boring excerpt that was made to look like an historical text in the middle."
2,Interesting but a bit plodding,"Yes, some wonderful history was portrayed in this book. Yes, the characters were fairly written. No, I didn't enjoy this as much as I thought I would have. Between the history and what one might call the exciting and active bits, the story hardly picked up its feet.There was a bit of rush-rush in parts then a dragging step through out other parts book. I finished it because I simply could not stand, not finishing a book."
3,"If you don't like letter novels, don't read it","In a nutshell, this novel is several different collections of letters read over and over again. It appeared to me to be a box inside a box inside a box. Despite its position on the best seller's list, it is very literary in how it treats the material. There is action interspersed between the letters, but too little of it. The climax of the novel isn't really -- I found it rather ho-hum. It was almost as if she built up all of this steam and then couldn't end it. I agree with another reviewer who said it could be about a hundred pages shorter. Several of the letter collections repeated the same information ad nauseum. The trips to different cities were fairly interesting, but there were so many of them that I lost track. If you like vampire lore, it's probably worth the trouble. If you don't, then you probably shouldn't bother with the book."
1,misleading data by seller,"The rock picks produced by Eastwings differs by their technical characteristics. This data on the site of Eastwings is incorrect, that makes a purchased product completely unnessary."
5,"Powerful, intimate stories","McNally's right, this is what great fiction does. It doesn't pander, it challenges. It doesn't show off, it goes deep. It's heartfelt but never simple. Even in his stories, Yates delivers the complexity of real life--mixed feelings, small victories and dead ends. He writes about people we wouldn't otherwise hear from. Also try his novel Easter Parade or his more famous Revolutionary Road. Both do that hardest thing: they move the reader without tricks."
5,Kings of Hip Hop,"Anything that has DJ Premier on it is worth listening to.Here he blends together classic funk, & soul cuts (check out the Pointer Sinster's ""Don't it drive you crazy"" which Premier himself used to lace the Step in the Arena classic ""Execution of a Chump"")or the original ""Ain't no Half-Steppin"" track, which was sampled countless times.Mr Thing can be heard mixing together 90s underground Hip Hop. What's good about this mix is that is allows you to go back in time and relive timeless classics (Eric B. & Rakim's ""Microphone Fiend"") and also to rediscover some underground tracks that you may have forgotten, or even overlooked (Common & De La Soul's collaboration ""The Business"", Kenny Dope's scratches on ""Get on Down"" to name but a few).Get this album if:1. You are fed up with corporate rap and want to go back and relive what Hip Hop music was all about2. You are new to hip hop and want to have an introduction to the music.Either way, just get this album, you won't regret it."
2,The 'how I stay in shape' biography,"I very rarely will not finish a book, but I had to cheat on this one. I just skimmed through the end. It did not come across that their love story was particularly special. I would like to think that it may have been, and the book just doesn't reflect that. It really seems as if it was used an excuse to write about herself, as opposed to the relationship."
2,Slow and Uninspiring-Dry,The title captured my interest but the contents left me short. An old and tired read which could have been so much better considering the topic. So dated and little in charm. I was truly disappointed.
2,A MIXED BAG,"3 DISKS DISK #1- The Concerto in F and Rhapsody in Blue. I almost wanted to get a refund on this one. It's recorded live and by the quality of the sound it might have been outdoors. The slowwwest Gershin on record, pun intended. DISK #2- PIANO WORKS - WORTH EVERY PENNY. Richard Rodney Benett is the pianist and he's wonderful. His rendition of the Preludes was the finest I've ever heard. He seemed very comfortable with the music and it was as if he were in my living room...playing as George would:)this disk alone would get four stars. DISK # 3 - GERSHWIN SONGBOOK - A mixture of songs and piano works with orchestra and sometimes electronic arrangements. Nice background music."
3,"An O.K. book, but choose another if possible.","This book could be alittle more detailed, i.e. using more examples. It throws random stuff at the reader for no reason which can be quite confusing. Try to convince your teacher to switch books in the beginning of the year; that's my suggestion."
2,Essential only for the AP Computer Science student.,"This book is written with the AP Computer Science Examinations in mind and therefore covers most of the basic topics that are tested on the AP examinations. However, it is poorly written and contains several inconsistencies. The fragmented explanations of working with text files are wholly inadequate. The section concerning the use of pointers and references is highly superficial and provides little in terms of true understanding of these concepts. The chapter on inheritance is unecessary because this is not part of the APCS subset and therefore is not tested on the AP exams. There are much better choices."
5,Great album,"I have had this in my car for the last two weeks, and don't feel like taking it out yet.I bought it to hear the Shortbus songs, but it turned me on to some great live stuff from Secret Hate and the Falling Idols. Also the Mongrel songs and Leek and the Bouncing Uptones are awsome.CD is worth it for the Shortbus songs alone."
3,correction,"This is not the same book as given in the description. the ""paperback edition"" is an entirely different book by different authors! This is a treatment of superconductivity which is elementary only to a theoretical physicist."
1,Dissapointed Reader,"I am very dissapointed with this book. I have read all Morgan's Mercenaries series. Because of this I expect ""Wild Woman's"" story to be great. I thought I would finally see why was she called ""Wild Woman"". I didn't see her until the last chapters. If I hadn't read MM's series I would have loved it. But because I did, I am truly dissapointed."
3,Thanks for ruining the movie,"Very quickly, this is a wonderful, gentle comedy which plays well to people who understand British humour. But why, why, why did the studio cut parts out? The DVD format could easily hold the entire movie. My recommendation is to buy the VHS tape, it's cheaper anyway and it shows the movie uncut. To the studio staff who made the decision to cut parts out....thanks for nothing."
2,Needs some spark,"This book tries to be to academic in its nature and is void of a head-on critique of how the media negatively affects us with constant agitation, violence and sales scams. To name some points. It does explain well some general structural issues in the media.I heard a great interview with Mr. Gitlin on NPR a couple of years ago which prompted me to buy the book soon after. I was disappointed to read a more or less uncritical analysis of the media structure or how media constantly censors out this type of information ""that's [not] fit to print"" while distracting everyone with dumb advertisements. Sort of reading an advertisers gung-ho explanation of how interesting advertising is. If you are into the media and how great it is, this is ""a great book""..."
2,"Moves at Speed of Light, Goes Nowhere","As a fan of Gitlin, I was hoping that he'd give me the bottom line - his bottom line - on the air we breathe today, the same way that brave souls such as Lasch, Marcuse, and Bell have done. But Gitlin isn't brave. He admits, honestly, up front, that he will reach few conclusions, and merely wants to lay out what we face each day on the streets, on TV, and on the net. What follows is a stream-of-consciousness depiction of life today. I want more than that from Gitlin. I want his conclusions, not some lame statement that he hasn't reached any yet. He's not getting any younger. Lots of other fabulous thinkers have failed at this stage of their lives. It's time for his masterpiece - the next book, perhaps."
1,Way over priced for over-produced songs from yesteryear,"I agree with the reviewer who commented that this CD is WAY overpriced for what it offers. . .a bunch of old recordings most of which I was able to find FREE in my local library on the Italian American CDs there! And yes, the MOB title is a disgusting sales tool. . .can't believe Italian Americans would support this lusterless CD that stereotypes a culture. If you are Italian American and care about your heritage, you shouldn't waste your money on these crappy (and offensive) CDs."
2,"Curly, but they do the job","Be prepared for these to curl up after the first pass through the dishwasher. It's not a complete nuisance, but it can be a little annoying.They curl to approximately the arc of a hula hoop - not quite a burrito, but certainly not flat.Also, the photo (due to the corner of the red mat being folded up), makes these appear to be a floppier, silicon-like material, but they are actually a semi-rigid plastic.All in all, at ~2 bucks apiece, they'll do the job, and I won't feel bad when I toss them in a year or so."
2,Just to be nice! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE!,"This is Sammy's worst album to date. Though, it has a couple of decent tracks (hence the 2 stars), the majority of the album lacks any of the quality and integrity that I would have expected from him. He's done a lot better work, but he has apparantly replaced quality with this sour attempt to gain more mainstrean radio appeal."
3,Too short,"I found this one to be lacking more description to create a good image of what went on up until the end when it seemed to be at its best. This one was a 2 day reading for me, and I am NOT a fast reader. It just had larger print and less detail. Pretty boring in most aspects, but the ending was good."
5,The Best,Too many books in this category rush to make conclusions for human behavior. This book allows the reader to actually think.
5,Great book,"I love this book. It was interesting and seemingly well researched. The format, an advice columnm to a myriad of species, is gimmicky, but it is cute and it keeps the discussion moving forward.The author commendably distinguishes issues of science which are well decided and those which aren't. And when she's offers her own opinion, she makes that clear."
4,16 in. spare tire,"Very easy to install- I did it in about 15 minutes. But beware, it does NOT fit with a 16 in. spare tire. Other than that, great!"
5,read them all,"I wrote the 2-star review below but it was for another book. Somehow, since I was writing a review for a couple infertility both books (I read them all!), a review I wrote for another book ended up here... the wrong one ended up here! (see below)So let me try again!I love this book -- A Few Good Eggs IS THE infertility book, at leas for me. I like the easy to understand quality of writing and the way it breaks information down to the way we women speak to each other. I like all the tips and the questions to ask a doctor or your partner. And I wish I had known about ""old eggs."" I would recommend anyone trying to conceive check out this book!"
1,Skip this book....,"From the cover and the first few pages of this book, I thought it was going to be a humourous, uplifting book that would help me on my fertility journey. Instead, I found the book to be condescending and blaming. There's an entire chapter called ""The Real Deal"" where they pretty much list all the reasons why it's all your fault that you are infertile. The advice they give is flippant and unhelpful. There is very little specific medical information. Their best advice for coping techniques was get more sleep and ""reflect on what you really want in life."" There were a few funny lines. But it feels as if the authors have not made peace with their experiences and are taking it out on us! The one thing that did make me feel better was when I threw the book against the wall!Instead, try reading ""Conquering Infertility"" by Dr. Alice Domar."
3,Good book,"I though this book was good but I wouldn't rely only on it for information when it comes to infertility. I read it because I really just wanted to hear some personal stories from other women who went though the same thing. It did do that but didn't have alot of info on the ""medical"" side of things."
1,This book is horrible.,"If you are buying this book and are over 35, you probably already know you are too old to have good eggs, waited too long to have kids, or marry the right guy, and were selfish by focusing on you and your career during your 20s. These two seemed to want to just chastise you for not grabbing the first guy you found at 18 and starting to have kids. I also found them a little pompous (as in yea - I had fertility problems but now look at me I have two kids, ha ha). Any woman who is going through infertility does not need this sort of info. I found it almost cruel. However, I could have ignored the stupid criticisms if there was any really useful info in the book. There wasn't. Most of it was very basic. If you are actually dishing out $25 for an infertility book you have probably already discovered cycle days and cervical mucus and the fact you need a fertility specialist. Try another book. This one is a waste of money."
5,PLEASE MERCY WITH NADIA.,"AFTER I READ THIS BOOK I COUDENT SLEEP FOR A WEEK,THIS IS UNACETABLE IN THIS CENTURY.IF SOMEBODY NOWS HOW I CAN FIND ZANA'S PAGE OR EMAIL, PLEASE CONTAC ME. I WANT TO NOW IF NADIA IS OREADY FREE OR SHE STILL IN HER PRISION. AND ALSO IF HER MOTHER HAD SEE HER BEFORE SHE WRITE HER BOOK, BECAUSE SHE FINISHED TO WRITED IN 93."
2,Great if I ever get an issue...,"I know this is a good magazine - that's why I ordered a subscription, however, I've yet to receive a single issue...still waiting."
1,Bad Purchase Overall,"I ordered this Guitar 3 day expedited delivery and it took them 8 days to send the actual package. Secondly I contacted their customer service support only to find out they had forgotten to place my order. Forgot!!!! When I actually received the actual Guitar it appear used and had many scratches on it, it had been clearly used before. Not a new Product! Buyer Beware , I will never buy from this vendor ever again , I will tell all about this horrible experience."
4,Impressive,"In this fascinating book, forty-six writers talk about what they do in forty-six voices worth listening to -- serious essays, whimsical essays, stories, confessions. The book does not provide biographies, although the basic facts of the lives of many are well known, such as John Updike, David Mamet, Saul Bellow and others. Writers On Writing might be of interest to those who have read Eleanor Wachtel's More Writers and Company, which includes bigraphical data and compelling interviews with about two dozen writers, including several who contributed essays to Writers On Writing: Carol Shields, Alice Walker, E. L. Doctorow, Louise Eldrich, Jane Smiley, and Jamaica Kincaid."
5,Wonderful Talc,Love this stuff. A dear friend gave it as a gift to me many years ago and I have been using it ever since. Your service was super.
4,a solid record,"First of all the track listing here isnt even close to being right (its obviously the Sonic Youth one.) Oh well, a minor ... oversight. Despite not knowing what is on it you should consider getting it anyway. I like almost all of the songs on it. Some are really super good, some are ok, one of them is pretty near bad but all in all its good. I like it more than the first two All Tomorrows Parties cds. At least Steven Malkman or whatever his name is isnt on this one."

5,Coach Rules!,"I love this show! I would really love to own the rest of the collection! The studios need to hurry up and release the other 5 seasons. Really, what's the delay?"
5,Coach,"Best bang for the buck I could find on such short notice. If you are a Craig T. Nelson fan or simply have a sense of humor, this will work very well for you! The entire cast had the strength to stand on their own and be hilarious in character."
5,Cantonese learner,"Only used two cds so far, the phrases are easy to learn. believe each dvd has short segments so better to get complete set for more topics to practice skills."
2,A disappointment,"Like other reviewers, I think it's getting to be time to give up on Auster. Not only was this book just way too obvious and pandering, the characters didn't actually behave like real human beings. Unlike his earlier books where the characters were obviously symbols in an unreal world, in this one the world is real, but nothing that happens in it is. Sorry to have to take him off my must read list, but all good things come to an end."
5,The best Auster by now,"This is the best Auster that I've read by now. Paul is one of the contemporary authors I like the most, and this novel is good, very good. A personal dramma tied to a mistery about an ancien actor, some very extreme -violent- situations near to love experiences.I reccomend it absolutely. I've read the Catalan translation."
3,"good ideas, but overwritten","Auster starts out talking about the problem with modern film (color and sound), telling us that it robs the images of their purity, that it weakens the language it is supposed to enhance. He then goes on to overwrite his narrative, often tediously so, and commits the same crime in literature. If only an editor had reduced the text by one quarter. Less would most certainly have been more."
3,Illusion of Depth,"This is a well-plotted, tightly written book that keeps you reading because you're not sure where the author is taking you. On the other hand, I kept thinking there would be more depth, more meaning to it than there was. I felt cheated by the time the book was over due to its pretension to philosophy (perhaps in part because of the way it was advertised to me when I bought it), when it was only a very good ride. If taken in that vein--just an adventure--it probably will not prove a disappointment to a different reader, because it does have some nice twists and turns in it and an interesting, if not always sympathetic, narrator."
1,book of illusions,A pretentious plod. Had to finish it for my book club otherwise would have willingly put it to one side. Paul Auster obviously rather fancies himself as he has quite a pompous style. Credibility of the characters and narrative is stretched to the limit over 300 horribly long pages. Some of the narrative is ludicrous and badly written - for instance when Alma pulls the gun on the hero. Up until then I was still hoping for something meaningful to develop and I had half liked Auster's descriptions of the old films but after Alma's appearance it was downhill all the way. Some people seem to write with the hope of a film contract in mind as this is packed with melodrama and ridiculous happenings.
5,Chocolate does a body good!!!,"I am truly a chocolate lover so this just put a little ""FLAVA"" into my already healthy appetite for the dessert. What a wonderful story, I loved the story just from reading the back cover. Olivia was a beautiful, intelligent thick sister who was all that plus some, she struggled with a demon but ""FLAVA"" helped her to work it out with buckets full of tender loving care. ""DRE"" what can I say but YUMMY. He was truly a dream, a man who knew what he wanted and went after it. This is a must read. Edwina Martin-Arnold is a wonderful writer. I would recommend this book and all her additional titles as well."
5,What you need to know,"This is a great book for anyone involved with childcare. It is a concise review with excellent guidelines and criteria. It thoroughly integrates a dauntingly scattered literature and as it does, it develops a useful and practical set of standards for childcare that practitioners, funders, evaluators, and yes even parents will appreciate. Very readable and accessible."
4,Disregard the image she presents.,"If you take away the Mad Mad House, the Def FX, the general need for media whoring, you have a well written, easy to read book.It's like any book - it is what you make of it. Despite the recent backlash in the community about her public career, he writing style is fun and friendly - it makes you feel as though she's telling you a story or relaying an anecdote as a friend. And trust me, after seeing years of the cookie-cutter, SR 101 books, it's nice to see something different."
3,Informative but boring,"Having read and very much enjoyed Ketchem's books on Boston, Trenton and Saratoga, I find this book a disapointment. Perhaps because this book is of the politics rather than of battle, it lacks the thrill of the pages that his other works provide. It's as exciting as a cerial box contents list. Most informative. Very cut and dried, and just as hard to swallow."
1,Best information in a easy to read format,"Stop the presses. I used the new guide this year and was disappointed, not nearly as good as in the past. I tried posting a review but it did not make it to print. There are major mistakes in the book of venues that have been closed for over a year. Better to stick with another guide.Restaurant info must also have been based on visits in the past as many of the recommended places offered poor service and high prices. The book just does not live up to what it used to be."
1,Abridged,The songs are abridged with verses missing. Disappointing because much of the fun of Cole Porter's music is the word play.
5,A real unique biography,"I had purchased this book after reading the book on Magellan. I would reccomend that book as well. Magellan's story got me interested in other explorers and so I started looking for a book on Cook, of whom I knew just a little. I looked for a good biography on cook and came across this book. It seemed different becuase It wasn't a straight forward biography. I didn't know at first how this would work out becuase I really enjoyed the Magellan book. But I really enjoyed this book as well. You do get a very good biography of Cook but you also get to enjoy the author's journey which although not as dramatic is a great break from the heavy life of cook. This unique combination keeps you interested and brings Cooks discoveries into the present. A thoroughly enjoyable book. Highly recommended."
4,Into the Blue,A wonderful way to learn about history and enjoy a travel tale at the same time. I laughed out loud during some of this. There is some rough language but really not much. I actually got this as a book on tape and it was a good travel companion.
3,Good author - book not what I expected.,"I gave this a 3 because 3/5ths of the book was fascinating. Unfortunately, the remaining 2/5ths of the book contained a barely comatose character named Roger. It got so bad that I began to skip pages whenever the author and Roger began to drink with the native peoples.The author writes in a very appealing style whenever talking of Cook and his crews. At times I was on that tiny ship as we were stranded on the barrier reef or approaching unknown natives for the first time. The day-to-day aspect of discovery is avoided in most adventure texts - this book brings it to life.So, I am sorry for the manic-depressive review but that is the way that I felt from way on with this book."
4,Good Stuff,"I wasn't all that interested in explorers until I read this book. since having done so, i have since read or am reading several other such non-fiction books.I liked the book's comparison between Cook's day and today's reality: Tahiti, for example, conjures up images of a tropical paradise with a promise of escape from stress. Not so, it turns out. Today's Tahiti is polluted, crime-ridden, hot and buggy. - Not a place I would've imagined.This book enlightened me via honestly describing real life. That's what I like."
3,QuarkXpress 7 - great chance to upgrade at low cost,"This offer was a great chance to upgrade to QuarkXpress 9 at low cost. I needed to work on a file from QuarkXpress, and needed the software. With their cost structure, almost an impossible task.In the end, I decided to move on to Indesign (which I find easier to work with).At least I have the capability - although I like the way Indesign supports creating a kindle output (including the plugin and instructions on the amazon website, easier to understand and execute)"
1,Description isn't accurate...,These are itty bitty. They also don't come with the fairy house or anything else like the description mentions. They are very little and don't do much. I got them for two bucks and wish I hadn't.
1,NOT GMWA National Mass Choir,"This CD is mislabeled. It's not the National Mass choir. It'sthe Northern California Chapter. If you look hard at the cover that's displayed under the 'Workshop Of America', you can kindamake out Northern California Chapter. I didn't do that when I ordered it and I haven't listened to it as yet since I'm debating with myself about returning it."
5,Great read and contains a bibliography.,"Not only are the anecdotes interesting and informative, but there is a bibliography in the back so you can do further study on the subject being discussed. Rigorous writing is definitely appreciated.I did check up on the figure of 32% of the working population experiencing some form of mental illness; on page 94 of the paperback. The Surgeon General's Report (1999 chapter 4) table 4.1 lists the total at 21% ([...])However,this was for only one calendar year.The other question I had was about the team dedicated only to doing hernia repairs. The book indicated (I think) local anesthesia, and the patient could get up and walk away after a 4"" incision. I find this questionable; in my own case, my inguinal hernia reapair only had a 2"" incision and I had to roll out of bed in the mornings for 4 or 5 days onto all fours and then stand up.Anyway, excellent book and lots of good information."
4,Interesting thoughts,This is great to listen to even if you do not have medical experience. Interesting thoughts and stories. Good philoposophies.
3,take it with a grain of salt,"This book has gotten rave reviews but I was not so impressed. Dr. Gawande describes his training in a large academic medical center where every test, scan and specialist is available at the snap of ones fingers. Mobs of specialists descend on complicated patients like swarms of locust. Dr. Gawande describes one anxiety filled period time when he has to wait a full 20 minutes for one such specialist to appear. This is not how most medicine is practiced. I think Dr. Gawande should do a shift in a rural emergency room to learn what real uncertainty is all about."
3,Good start and End,"I enjoyed reading this book.I did find that the author seemed to lose focus midway through the book, and for probably a chapter it was quite a struggle to keep reading.The book ended strongly and overall was an interesting insight into the uncertainty that goes with modern medicine and surgery.Recommended reading for anyone interested in pursuing medicine as a career."
3,A bipolar book,"I loved the first third of the book, because Gawande was relating his own personal experiences as a resident learning how to be surgeon. I thought those chapters were compelling because they was based on his own direct and often dramatic experiences. The rest of the book is very different. It is standard 'reporting' on various medical conditions not based on his own direct experience as a doctor, but based on things he has read, and interviews he has conducted. It is stuff that any reporter could have written, and lacks the immediate and personal nature of the first third of the book.Parenthetically, this is the same transition that Jerome Groopman went through in New Yorker articles -- the first of which were riveting accounts of his own experiences as an oncologist dealing with specific patients. His later articles, like the last two thirds of Gawande's book, were dry ""reporting"" on medical issues."
4,the medieval warhorse from Byzantium to the crusades,"This is an excellent reference for anyone interested in warhorses. Hyland has done extensive work to shed light on a little known area of the middle ages. She does a good job arguing some of the typical stereotypes of the medieval warhorse (size) and backs up her findings in a believable fashion. She does show some definate biases, which are easy to ignore. A good book."
3,"Doug and Melissa cardboard blocks, our son loves them","Our son loves these blocks. He plays with them everyday. I find them a tad hard to store, they take up a lot of room. Also it is tedious to put them together. He is having a great time with them and he is obsessed with building and big cities. Overall worth the purchase but have a nice place to store them, or they will be in the way!"
4,A Quick Read,"I like it. It was a quick read. Our Nig gives insight into domestic slavery. However, if you are reading this for class, be prepared to read it twice for full understanding or take notes as you read."
2,Reads like a weird college textbook,"I forced my way through this book on the recommendation of a friend. The book's focus was too broad, and tried to take on too much: the Chicago World's Fair, the assassination of Chicago mayor Carter Harrison, Sr., the indecision that delayed the fair's opening on schedule, the many colorful guests who visited the fair, the first Ferris wheel, the impending financial meltdown, and the mass murderer and his victims who happened to live in Chicago during the fair. How did the fair change America? I don't think that question was answered. I was impressed by the author's footnotes, however. Obviously the book was a labor of love."
3,Too much boring detail,There were interesting parts to this book but way to much boring detail. I ended up speed reading to finish it. I have read other books by this author that I thought were good.
5,Fact is truly stranger than fiction,"What a great book. It is great for those who enjoy history as well as those who enjoy a suspense novel. An eye-opening account of what the United States and the world was like around the end of the 1800's. It is incredible what those architects were able to produce in such a short amount of time. It is hard to believe that it was merely over 100 years ago. We are introduced to many major world players in different industries who all happened to be involved in the World's Fair. The way it is written between the chapters and lives of Daniel Burnham and H.H. Holmes was genius. I found myself eager to start the next chapter to see what was happening with the ""other"" story."
5,Interesting facts,"This is really two stories combined into the one setting. The murders were exascerbated by the arrival of the world fair and the many people (young women) it attracted. The facts and logistics of the creation of the exposition were quite mind-boggling. It is amazing that it was ever produced, much less so overwhelmingly successful. I really enjoyed the ""white city"" part better than the ""devil""."
3,I'm torn...,"Sometimes I'd sit and read and be engrossed in the story...sometimes I'd sit to read and just be bored with it. The fair storyline was good but I think I got bored with it the most. The Holmes storyline was really good and definately made the book better, the ending was especially good.I'm a big reader of GRRM, Hobb, Rothfuss, Brooks, etc so that's likely why I didn't quite get into this book as much as most people do but realize why this book overall has high reviews.Recommended to some but may just be ho-hum to others."
5,A gem,"Erik Larson's 2003 effort ""The Devil in the White City"" is as fine a historical true crime tale as I've run across. He has a later book written on a similar pattern, ""Thunderstruck,"" which I haven't yet read. But based on its reviews, I would be inclined to believe it is also marvelous. Larson's approach to ""The Devil"" is to track the life arc of a murderer during an event of large historical significance. In this case, that's the Chicago World's Fair of 1893, the ""White City"" referred to in the title. The murderer is man who used the draw of the fair to isolate and dismember one young woman after another --- the number apparently never totally determined. Larson did an immense amount of research and yet stepped back from that effort enough to craft a thoroughly readable and well-integrated story that moves along almost effortlessly. It's a gem."
2,Just Okay,"Nothing to write home about. I was a bit disappointed and thought that he went off into too many architectural/building details. I was more interested in the people side.The good thing is that I now know that I won't be spending any more of my $ or time on his other books, which previously, I had been wondering about."
5,Excellent Narrative of Two Parrallel Events,"What Larson did was show how two well publicized events, one awe inspiring, the other tragic and shocking, unfolded simultaneously in Chicago during the 1890s. That both have faded from the collective American memory is a question that Larson lays out before us. Both subjects are masterfully depicted, turning history into a gripping thriller, a combination so very rare in today's non-fictional writing. I can't wait to revisit Chicago."
4,Was on my list for a long time...,This book was on my reading list for a long time and was one of the books I was most anxious to read. Larson does a commendable job in relating the facts in a compelling way that propels the reader to keep turning the pages. This is not historical fiction. This is pure history written as an investigative report in a magazine might read. I recommend this book to anyone interested in history or true crime.
1,I was hoping for more after In the Garden of Beasts,"If you want to read every last minute detail of the building of the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, this book is for you. As a bonus, you will get strange factoids that don't even jive with the part of the book into which they are inserted. The best parts of this book are the ""serial killer"" sections. Unfortunately, they are very short and are found among volumes of world's fair history. This book needed an editor. If I had read this before In the Garden of Beasts, I would not have read this. I really liked in the Garden of Beasts, but this is not an interesting or compelling book."
1,devil in the white city,"Terrible book. Reads like it was lifted from Wikipedia...stale, stilted and utterly devoid of passion or suspense.If they had a zero star option, I would have ""given"" it that."
5,discover your darker side,"i read the book in less than a week - fascinating descriptions, great narrative, etc! this book is beyond fiction..i especially enjoyed the description of chicago at the height of the ""gilded age"" and the workings of burnham, olmstead and others involved in the design/architecture and execution of the ""white city"" - i can't imagine anything of this scale happening in the current social and economic environments and its a pleasure to read about itbut more than anything, i looked forward to the holmes (""the devil"") chapters. i'm not much of a rubber-necker, and this book provided me a first-hand experience in fascination-by-destruction. wow!!"
4,"solid, interesting","I found this book immensely interesting, yet I cannot in good faith call it a ""page turner"". It tended to be a bit dry at times. On the plus side was the surprisingly interesting account of all the details that went into the creating of the 1893 World's Fair. One certainly gets a flavor for this time period in our history. The sections on Holmes are, not surprisingly, more interesting (as well as disturbing of course). Personally I would have preferred more on Holmes, as a proportion of the overall tale. And I don't know what this says about me, but I would have preferred more of the gory details. We seem to get a somewhat sanitary portrayal of an unbelievably unsanitary soul."
4,Reads Like a Thriller,"This book is a very exciting and informative book. It often reads like a thriller, and keeps the reader's attention very easily for the first 4/5's of the book. The story starts to lag at the end, but the lag doesn't take away from the excellent writing, and intrguing tale that the writer so aptly conveys.The story of the Chicago's World Fair is one of excitement, but most people are oblivious to the sinister murders surrounding the time and area of the Fair. If you're interested in both, enjoy tales of history, and/or like ""true crime"" stories, then give this one a read. You won't be disappointed."
4,Historical Nonfiction that reads like Fiction,"I just finished reading The Devil in the White City, and what can I say? Erik Larson has such a talent for weaving true historical facts into such a readable story. The book takes 2 tacks, one follows the architect of the Chicago World's Fair through the thought, planning and execution of the event. What interesting modern day marvels were introduced there, over 110 years ago. Amazing. The other plot lines involve a serial murderer and the economy, which shockingly seems to mirror our present day economic meltdown. I really enjoyed this book, though i found myself hurrying through some of the fair details to get to the nitty gritty of Dr. HH Holmes and his twisted mind. While the story is somewhat macabre, the details are left for the most part to your imagination for those of you, who like myself, don't do well with true crime books that are horrific in their description of events."
3,Eerie moments in time,"A bit plodding and filler, but all in all a decent read. Amazing story about the dark secrets within human nature and its close proximity to the naive. Be careful around those who seem properly ordered. You may be surprised. Vigilance against evil is the lesson here."
3,Not quite what I was expecting.,"Worth the money but not as good as I thought it would be. Very informational concerning the World's Fair, sometimes too much concerning details that really didn't pertain the story. Of course all the victims were gone, and couldn't tell details that leave you just wondering about what actually happened. And it was a long time ago."
5,Great Chicago History!,"I had hear about this book for a long time, and finally read it - it was so much fun. I really loved how Mr. Larson told the two stories in parallel with each other. The stories really came alive - what an exciting and dramatic time."
5,Very Good Book,This book offers a history lesson (of Chicago in the 1890's) and a fascinating murder mystery. It will hold your interest from start to finish.
3,Skip the audiobook,"I listened to this book while doing a project at my house. Reading it would be far preferable, for two reasons. First, giving the two stories equal importance, the 1893 Chicago World's Fair and a local serial killer, just doesn't work. The murder narrative should have been a minor tangent. Had I been reading the book, I would have skipped over or skimmed these chapters. Second, the narrator, Scott Brick consistently annoyed me with his John Malkovich impression--arch, sing-songy delivery."
3,THE DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY,"I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED. I EXPECTED IT TO READ MORE LIKE A STORY RATHER THAN A HISTORY BOOK. THE INFO WAS INTERESTING TO ME BECAUSE I WAS BORN IN CHICAGO, BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THIS AS A FAVORITE READ FOR ANYONE OUTSIDE OF ILLINOIS. BUT THEN, I'M NOT A ""NON-FICTION"" FAN."
4,Side-by-Side storylines don't fail to keep your attention,"While the title was initially deceiving to me, I quickly became entrenched in this historical depiction of Chicago's rich history. The dual storylines were expertly written and there were many instances were you are kept guessing. So much history of America is wrapped up into this unassuming novel that when I finished the book, I was hoping for a continuation...think about it Larson! Maybe a similar storyline for NYC or another lesser known historically fantastical city!"
4,"Great story, a little long through the middle...","This is a great story with great Chicago/U.S. history mixed in. It gets a little long through the middle with descriptions of the building, but overall a great book."
4,Entertaining & Unique,"This was very entertaining and an easy read! I especially liked how the author mingles non-fiction parallel stories. A little science is nice, with the getting inside the good-and-the-bad character's heads really compelling. I like this one better then Thunderstruck, but it may be tied to my first intro of idea and author . .expectations are higher with new releases."
3,SLOW read!,"Disappointing book. The author certainly needs to be commended for his meticulous research but the book gets totally bogged down in architectural trivia. The Holmes murder case parallels the fair's development but it too never really builds to any great level of suspense. When I finished it, I felt I could have spent my time better reading some other books."
4,"A fascinating piece of history, and my first Kindle read","I chose this as my first Kindle book because it seemed like a straightforward narrative, which it was,even with the inter-twining tales of the making of the fair and the evil-doing of the killer. It absolutely enhanced my interest in one of my favorite cities. The confluence of personalities around the fair and the scope of the effort, coupled with the abject filth of the river and environs (so starkly contrasted with the fairground) is absolutely amazing. I strongly recommend the book, and, once you've read it, to take some time online and look at the archival photos of both the fair and information about the multi-named H. H. Holmes."
1,The Devil killed the editor?,"I agree with the other one-star reviews here. A friend recommended it to me because I love Caleb Carr's ""The Alienist"". In contrast, this book is plodding and painfully repetitive. I could've easily made a drinking game of the times Larson uses the phrases ""his blue gaze"" or the words ""Chinook"" (as an adjective) and ""macadam"". Larson has a gift for painfully awkward descriptive phrases and I'd say half of the material in the book didn't lend itself to the story at all."
2,Not at all what I expected.,I was very disappointed in this book. I got it thinking it was a great murder mystery but instead it was all about the construction of the buildings of the time. I tried my best repeatedly but was unable to get past the first half of the book.
2,Not done yet...but it's a chore at this point to continue...,"I'll start with the caveat that I haven't yet finished the book. The Kindle version says I'm about 25% done with it...but it's a chore to read so far. If it didn't come so highly recommended by my sister-in-law...I would have put it down by now. In fact, I did put it down once...(meaning I quit reading it), but picked it back up at her insistence. If a book doesn't get me after the first 30+ pages...it's history. This book hasn't gotten me yet...the whole architectural thing is too slow and drawn out. Too much detail about about a bunch of architects that drags on and on. I guess if you're into Chicago or Architecture...it might work for you. I like Lee Child, Vince Flynn, etc., that kind of action, and this book doesn't have it. I'm going to try and continue...but...it better pick up soon or I'll fall asleep."
2,Devil in the white city,disappointing. A tedious compilation of historical data and anecdotal evidence. Mack the Knife story set in Chicago. TMI
3,Writing nothing special,"The details about Chicago are great and interesting! The writing is not terrible, but its exceptionally repetitive and starts to lose any power or surprise less than halfway through the novel. The murders and terror of the ""devil"" are simple, undeveloped, and not interesting at all. However, if the historical ""facts"" are in deed facts, that is the truly remarkable portion of the book. Unfortunately it is the only remarkable part.That being said, I did finish it..."
4,Creepy!,"Since it's based on real events, this book commands your attention as you delve into the mind of a psychopath. It's truly hard to believe that anyone could be so cruel. I only gave it 4 stars because much of the book is about the city itself and can be a bit dry when going into detail about construction."
4,Non fiction that reads like a novel.,"The best thing about this book is it's narrative style. I'd never read any other Larson books prior to reading this one. I am impressed. It reads more like a novel than a history/ non - fiction book. The author presents characters in a such a graphic light I had a hard time putting it down. By the time I was through I gained knowledge about the people and events, which are from the Chicago World's Fair in 1895. I liked this enough to decide to read another Larson historical book! I highly recommend it for teachers. Students won't even realize that it's non fiction if you don't tell them! A little caution though: read it yourself first if you're thinking about using it in schools. Some of the scenes are graphic.LewisHenry"
4,History of Chicago World's Fair and the Serial Killer who Prowled the Fair for Victims,"This is a fascinating history of the Chicago World's Fair in the early 20th century. The book is comprised of alternating chapters about the memorial work of this country's greatest landscape architects, juxtaposed with chapters about a serial killer on the prowl at the Fair.The killer is looking for single women to bring to a torture chamber he has built nearby the fair. The architects are worried about tight timeframes and ways to get all the glitches out of the building structures.I especially enjoyed the descriptions of the personal characteristics of the individual architects, their relationships with each other, their frailties and their strengths. I learned a lot about Frederic Law Olmsted, our country's greatest landscape architect, and was sad to learn about the depression that ailed him most of his life.I highly recommend this book."
4,"Yes, you will want to read this","I won't describe the story, all the other reviews do that. The question is, should you get this book? The answer is yes.Here are the reasons why:1. It is a true story, which makes it that much more enthralling.2. It describes what Chicago/US was like back in the 1890s. I never enjoyed my history classes in school, but if they had involved novels like this, then I would have aced those classes.3. It tells you about the actions of one SCARY individual in Chicago at that time. Why he isn't more famous, even today, is a mystery.4. Much like The Garden of Good and Evil gets you excited to visit Savannah, this book gets you excited about seeing Chicago and what remains of the fair's buildings."
3,The Devin in the White City,"I really enjoyed this book. It took awhile to get through it though. I haven't read a ""history"" book that reads like a novel in such a long time. The author uses facts like his own ideas and thoughts."
5,Excellent Story; Interesting History,"This book is such a great read and entertwines so much history and information, it's incredible. If you are from Chicago or know the city, this is a must-read. If not, it is still the fascinating history of the World's Fair, many introduced products still popular today, the Ferris Wheel, and of course the first recorded serial killer in America. Creepy and unreal. I recommend this book highly!!"
5,Facinating!,"I can't believe I didn't know anything about this time in US History before. The Chicago fair as background to a serial killer is facinating. This book is very well written. You'd think a book about architecture might be dry, but its really not at all. Highly recommend this book. Its a slo a great book for a book club."
2,One book...or two?,"Maybe I'm alone in this opinion, but this reads like two separate and distinct books that only share a setting. I have to confess that I'm only a bit over half way through the book, but so far the story of building the fair and the story of Holmes the serial killer seem to stand so separately that I can hardly see the justification for the two stories to share a set of covers.While I am finding the story of the fair's construction to be a very good read, I can't say the same for Holes' story. Larson seems to be reaching here, desperate for real blood curdling details that he just doesn't have to give.I seem to be in a minority with this opinion, so perhaps a miracle occurs in the second half of the book that brings these two stories together in a meaningful way...hope springs eternal..."
3,Two stories for the price of three,"I jumped at reading this one, but the back-and-forth style, from Fair to killer, became numbingly predictable. I, too, could not put it down, however. It's a sword with two fairly sharp edges; the steel between the edges needs tempering. A more compelling weave would have done more justice to two surprisingly interesting stories. Both capture startling representations of turn-of-the-century America. A more compelling narrative style might have made this apparent. That's the third story here, and it's missing."
4,The Devil in the White City,Very interesting. I found I was telling friends and talking about this book more than I usually do about a book I'm reading. This is our Book Club selection and I am very musch looking forward to our discussion.
2,Dull,"If you want to hear about all the minutia of the Chicago World's Fair, then this book is for you. It took forever to get going and then I found it very dull, not what I expected based on the synopsis of the book."
3,devil in white city,"This book was intersting historically. I learned a lot about the World's Fair and architecture. I felt that the two story lines never really came together, and I did struggle to finish it. However, I have many friends who absolutely loved this book!"
1,Not a true crime book,This book would be good for someone interested in learning about the Chicago World Fair and the people involved but it was definitely not a true crime book. More than 1/2 the book was about the Exposition and the parts about the murders weren't even facts but assumed truth. If you want to read a book on true crime Ann Rule is good and it is true facts. The only real facts of this book was about the fair.
