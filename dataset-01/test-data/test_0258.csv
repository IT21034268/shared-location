3,Not worth the price,"No fault of the seller..the product is okay, nothing to rave about. Very pricey for what it is.Would not purchase again."
4,Very good value for this price,"The only thing that I would like better, is if both sides of the back were finished so that it did not have to be placed so precisely. It was simple to put together, and so far is working very well for what I needed. I even placed a printer on top of one unit, and it doesn't shake when it prints."
3,Made in China,"This is a good drill, but I was very surprised to see it is made in China. So is the Milwaukee V18. The Makita is made in Japan. I wish I would have gotten the Makita."
1,Painful!,"OH MY GOSH! My books of choice are usually some sort of history book, which is why I chose this one. I have never struggled through a text that was this painful. Poorly written, difficult to follow.Find another book on Holland's history to read instead of this one."
3,Doo Wop,"This album is good but after the first album I listened to by this group ""Frankie & Fashions Future Favorites"" the sound is just not that strong by the backups. I still continue to buy music by this group. If you want to hear a great song from them try CD Frankie & Fashions United in Group Harmony. The first song is a knockout ""What Do I Have To Do"". That will blow your socks off."
4,"Not bad, not great.","It's a costume so I did not expect great quality but overall it's a fitting costume. The wig is nice. The glasses are tinted blue and very cartoonish but I bought a smaller pair that went really well with the rest. The skirt is long enough. The felt type top is warm. My only complaint, a little short."
1,Not a Yeoman,"The knife you will receive is the newer BSA Explorer not the Yeoman that is pictured. While the Explorer is a fine knife (I already have a couple) it is not what I wanted. I wanted a 3 layer SAK with magnifying glass and in line Phillips screwdriver. The Explorer is a 4 layer knife, too thick for my every day use. This is a great knife if you want a BSA Explorer but not if you expect a Yeoman."
4,Fuel the Passion Inside,"""Do not let mediocre people discourage you,"" writes Nancy Anderson as she encourages her readers to discover the passion within and apply it to their lives. Such passion will attract other people to you. She notes, ""People cooperate with people for mutual gain in a trade-off situation.""On the examined life, she includes an exercise whereby you can write the epitaph for your life. In essence, mine was to live passionately as a steward to Jesus Christ, maximizing the resouces He provided for me to serve as steward over.She has some insightful things to say about how our work defines us, telling us, ""It is through the dignity of the work we do that we achieve self-esteem in life."" Anderson is a big advocate of enjoying life's journey, reminding readers that life can be adventurous and provide satisfaction."
4,For people interested in Fashion Design,"I purchased this book on amazon.com at a very reasonable price and was very pleased with my purchase. For under $20 this book provided me with the information I was looking for. I recommend it to anyone, especially students interested in majoring in Fashion Design in college. This book explains the basics of what majoring in Fashion Design requires, and goes into describing the what, when, where, and why of what being a Fashion student involves. I really enjoyed reading this book and learned a lot!"
4,entertaining and informative,"The book isn't as bawdy as the description would lead one to believe. I'd say the book is evenly divided between the convicts and sea faring information. I learned quite a bit about bilges, tar, shipwrecks, and the history of sea travel in the 1700s. I bought the book for the stories of the convicts, so I was a bit disappointed, but learned so much about a topic I knew absolutely nothing about, sailing the high seas, it evened the score. Great book."
3,not enough,"After only a few sessions watching this video, I was bored with it. Scott is not a very compelling instructor."
4,Highly Recommended Router Table,"Very well built, high quality and looks pretty. Kind of a bitch to put together as some of the instructions could be more clear or at least have better pictures. Otherwise, highly recommended."
2,Table too low,It would have been a nice product if it was a little bit higher.I can't remove or install motor from it without moving the top plate. If it was made 2 - 3 inches higher I wouldn't have any problem putting my router motor in and out.I am using Bosch router model 1617EVS.
1,Dust port arrived broken; was never replaced,"Wow--I wanted to surprise my fiance for his birthday. I bought it with the Bench Dog router lift, and that actually fit great--customer reviews of the the lift is actually why I bought this brand--I usually go Delta for everything.BUT the dust port arrived broken in 3 pieces (it's a brittle plastic part) and after an email with the Bench Dog customer service, they said I'd get a replacement--the instructions say not to use the product without the dust port.Well, it never came! and I can't find a replacement part online anywhere. So goodbye $850 and maybe we'll try to rig something out of sheet metal. Lame, and very disappointing!"
4,wine saver,"service was as explained, quick, but this was purchased for my daughter and her husband so I don;t know if it works or not and she never mentioned wheather she liked it or not"
1,An extremely successful scam,"I didn't think to question or research this wine preserver until after I received it. The principle SEEMS valid, but once I received it I questioned how effectively it actually evacuates air from the bottle. Then my research revealed questions about the stopper's ability to maintain what vacuum there is. So, I did a simple test. I pumped all the air out of a bottle that the unit was capable of and let it sit for a few hours. After only maybe 6 hours, the stopper was so easy to pull out (without releasing pressure first) there is no way there was much of a vacuum at all left in the bottle. At least it was cheap, but this unit is a complete scam. An incredibly successful and profitable one at that, it seems."
3,Can't hold air tight,This bottle stopper cannot hold air tight for long. I vaccum air out and it looks tight for couple hours then the air come in. It cannot help to keep the wine good b/c the air come in make the wine taste worse.
5,Really works!,"I have been using my Concerto for several months now, and I am a raving fan! I drink wine frequently, but seldom finish a bottle in one evening. The Concerto is so easy to use to ""vacuum-pack"" your leftover wine for storage in the fridge. The unit makes a little chirping noise when the vacuum is reached, so it's foolproof to use. Wine stays fresher longer, and I am a happy enophile! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
2,Don't let your wife use it,"This is the second Vac-u-vin I have purchased - the last one at a winery in California. The first one worked great for a couple of months then one day, my wife was using it and it froze up. You couldn't pull it or push it - like it had gasket slip loose inside or something. You can't take them apart to see so we just bought a new one thinking it was defective. This one lasted less than 2 weeks. Worked great, the wife tried it one day and POOF, it wouldnt push or pull. I won't be buying them again (at least not with this wife)."
5,Andrew Gold Presents AndrewGold -- Album No. I,"This album is a fine starter-album for the up-and-coming Linda Ronstadt band-member. Although the production is a bit weak, particularly the vocal stregth of Mr. Gold on Heartaches By The Number, this album gave Linda Ronstadt fans a bit of a head-scratchier -- to wit, being an introduction to a very talented young musician. The album, mostly sort-of a California-Eagles sort-of sound, is good. The album shines with Mr. Gold's 1st track, 'That's Why I Love You', which is a very lovely song."
3,Great Overview,"I read the book The Healing Power of Aromatherapy by Hansnain Walji, Ph. D. This is the first book of its kind that I have read. It is a great overview book. It has a history of aromatherapy, when the use of aromatherapy was first recorded all the way up to current uses. The book gives you comparisons to or along with other types of therapy. The book povides a list of essential oils, what their key uses are, what family they belong to, a general description, a history and/or folk lore, where the oil is obtained, volatility, fragrance, principal constituents, contraindictions, general properties, and general uses. The book provides an overall mixing ratio. It does not provide specific recipes for a particular oil(s) and/or use(s), which I would like to see. Overall this book is a great overview and is excellent reading material for someone wanting broad information."
2,What's the Big Deal?,"The big secret life of the Chief of Police is simply not that interesting. It is very difficult to care about the victims. The wife is a spoiled brat and the husband is a retarded lech. These people were raising damaged children further traumatized by this violent, selfish turn of events. The parents do get high marks for lousy parenting. If you want to learn how not to behave, buy this book.The writing is average and redundant. It is clear that much ""filler"" was put in to make it a full book. The author simply should have chosen a more interesting subject. On the surface, I can imagine he thought it was. A closer look is just another pathetic ugly divorce."
5,Terrific read,"Paul LaRosa is an award-winning newspaper reporter and TV news producer, and his experience and expertise fuel this factual, compelling book. In an era where labels like ""non-fiction"" and ""memoir"" have been corrupted by greedy writers and even greedier publishers, what a delight to read a straight-forward, factual account of the events leading to a tragic, fascinating crime. This is true-crime reporting and writing at its best."
1,Subtle victim blaming,"David Brame was a chief of police who committed at least one rape of a woman other than his wife--whom he raped repeatedly---and terrorized certain members of his department, mostly the women. He harassed and tormented his wife.This book could benefit from a little feminist perspective. In fact, it's not that shocking to find some cops are wife-beaters; it's a macho culture. Nor is it shocking to find a chief of police beating his wife----to whom, after all, would she report him? His own department?"
3,A little on the flimsy side,"This bracelet is so cute, and it looked exactly the way I expected it would. However, I gave it to someone as a gift, and it promptly broke. I think its rubber thread is too weak. Don't buy this unless you're good at restringing beads."
5,Hapa,I like anything Hapa puts out. They are also very good in concert. I live in Phoenix AZ and they come here atleast 2 times a year and alos can catc from time to time in CA at Half Moon Bay
5,True Hawaiian music,"I loved listening to this CD on Aloha Joe radio online, so choosing to buy this was easy. Great sound, great voice, all around good Hawaiian CD!!!"
4,Barbie Gone Platinum,"This is a brand new doll , beautifully dressed.I would not take this doll out of her box unless you plan to put her in a display case.She is too gorgeous to play with.She is for the adult collector, not for young children to play with."
3,fun game,Fun for the younger age children. Fits into the portable and stationary vtech games. Several game options in each game.
2,Should have been a video,"O.K., I try and support my folks who star in these movies, but sometimes I wish I didn't have to. Bones and Kingdom Come were two of them.As African Americans we need to support each other, but I'd rather watch movies with a storyline that follows through, and makes me not recognize the actor, just the character they are playing.I took my kids to see this as opposed to trick or treating, and we wished we had gone to Blockbuster instead.I kept waiting for Snoop to start rapping, Pam to break out in Coffee, and Clifton to change into his Pinkie suit:).Save your money, tape it when it comes on cable."
2,Bones,"BonesWhat can I say about it? I tried to enjoy it I really did. I want to say it was a good movie. But at the same time there were parts of it that were so bad I seriously wondered if they were trying to be funny. Snoop dogg easily carried the movie. He seemed to enjoy playing the part the idea and the actual character were very cool I liked the idea of a powerful figure who gets killed and comes back to life and when he does it&#65533;s quite cool. But it&#65533;s not scary, not very good and sometimes just not very fun.I didn&#65533;t hate it so I can&#65533;t say I don&#65533;t recommend it. But it&#65533;s like the 1st two Wishmaster movies the idea is good but the movie itself sucks. With the acceptation of a few good visuals it just bites in the end. Bones I recommend if you want two hours to kill and don&#65533;t want a horribly bad horror movie. This movie isn&#65533;t bad but it the way it&#65533;s done simply sucks.Zombie Claus"
2,I Have A BONE To Pick,"Is Bones a horror movie? Being grossed out by a rainfall of insects is not the same as scared. Is it an artsy-noir film? It seemed to try to be without any relevance. Given that the cinematography and special effects were excellent, the story line left something to be desired. Thin on plot and ragged on the edges. The kids find a dog locked up in a building. Nowhere in the film is the dog's presence explained. It seems to have just wandered through the filming without any direction or motivation. Jimmy Bones decapitates two of his victims at one point, and the heads start talking in a pathetic attempt at humor that does not fit in at all with the genre. The legend is barely explained as JB wreaks his revenge on his friends who were forced at gunpoint to let him die, or die with him. He should have stayed dead. Granted Bones will cause a hair or two on the back of your neck to prickle, but will it be because you shelled out eleven bucks to see it?"
4,Enjoyable,I have seen this movie before buy the movie. I figure to try before buy the movie. Whether I like the movie or not which I do like very much. Worth watching something different than vampires or werewolf. Even though there was a wolf in this movie. Not exact wolf either. You got to watch it for yourself before make any decisions.
2,Doesn't cover the grey!,"If it can't cover the grey hair, what is then the purpose??? You should be blond to use it, and you will end up with locks of orange color."
3,It's Not All Natural,"I am extremely allergic to chemical hair dyes (severe swelling, itching, burning) so tried this to cover the 15% grey in my very dark brown hair. It worked very well to blend grey, but it is NOT all-natural. All Surya cream colors contain aniline dyes (such as Disperse Violet, HCA red, etc.) They are clearly listed on the ingredients on the box; I don't know why they aren't listed here as well. I react slightly to them but nothing like the PPD in permanent hair dyes, so I plan to use this as long as I can. I do wish the color lasted longer though, it washes out in about a month and since I am a swimmer, the chlorine in the pool bleaches it out even faster."
1,"Doesnot work on hair, but will work on skin","I dont have much gray hair, but even then this doesnot work to coverup gray. There was no change in the color for hair even after keeping it for 1 hr as instructed. But All my skin got really dark, and it is really looking bad ( like a scar now) I hope it will get back to normal with 2-3 shampoos. Dont buy this product at all. It is useless."
3,"Depends Upon How You Define ""Everything""","""Everything"" is an overstatement, albeit a great notion. I wanted to learn to do everything!But if you want to move your desktop icons you will need to go to Blackberry's website to find out how, and if you are unable (despite following instructions) to remove the pesky default ad-tag line ""Sent wirelessly ..."" that appears after your signature in emails you will have to phone your service provider.This nice-looking book does not tell you ""everything"" by any means. It is actually little more than a restatement of the documentation that comes with a Blackberry."
3,Not helpful with newer blackberries,I bought this book for the office hoping it would help in understanding the simple tasks as well as the more detailed tasks the blackberry is capable of performing. It was a little disappointing. I found more help on the blackberry website tutorial than I found in this book. Hopefully a book will come out that has been revised for the newer blackberries that will be more helpful.
3,rockports in general,So far I have always been very satisfied with all my purchases from Amazon and this one is very good
5,Foot Friendly,"The best shoe around if you are looking for good arch support. They are light weight so walking is effortless. Try them, you'll like them."
3,Prowalkers,"I ordered these to for my 81 year old father to replace the very old pair he wore constantly. These were priced nicely, came quickly but really didn't look the same quality as his old pair. The looked like Rockport knock offs. If they were for me - I would have returned them but dad seems happy with the possible imitation."
4,comfort at a good price.,i wear a wide shoe and have a hard time finding one that's comfortable under $100. i was skeptical about buying the rockport prowalker. well i've been wearing the shoe for a month now and am very pleased with the way they feel. imagine a shoe that feels this good under $50.00. i will definitely buy this shoe again.
1,Cheap is cheap,"I've been purchasing Rockport shoes since the 1970's. I was always very satisfied. Pro walkers were always my favorite ... The most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased. I just bought a new pair (in June, 2012), which are as uncomfortable as you can imagine. They're cheap ... There's really no other word for it. They are no longer made in China (would you believe it), and that's the reason for their cheapness! Yes, cheap IS cheap!"
3,prowalker review,Not as comfortable as the world walking classic shoe . i would recommend the latter although the pro walker is less money
4,cooking it up,My daughter ordered this and has used it a few times. The recipes are easy to follow and taste good. It's well organized. My only complaint is that there aren't that many.
1,unreliable and hard to use - thumb down,"Do not buy. It crashed several times on a plain Dell 8600. Very hard to use, like for example to set up rooms, because (1) there are no anchor points; should be able to anchor a corner and then drag a corner; (2) we cannot lock a room in place; while editing a room, another room resized; (3) there is no alignment among rooms; rooms should align sometimes, because they may share a common wall; (4) while working with a room, we cannot specify the type of wall; and so on. It has some sexy colors and menus, but after trying to use it for several times and coming out with no results, the next step is 'uninstall'."
4,1-800-BET-ON-IT,"Al Pacino and Matthew McConaughey make a far better pairing than I thought they would. Pacino is amazing, as usual. Playing a man wrapped up and completely vested in a dangerous business that bankrupts and corrupts people, he makes you feel for him, for the most part. McConaughey is a sports adviser prodigy. Pacino's character offers him a job and flashes him some dough - and next thing you know, he's on his way to New York, where he steps into the ""big leagues"". He's thrown in head-first by Pacino. He continues to pick up steam and gain clout, and so you simply expect him to slip, eventually.In this movie, the talk is quick and the money moves just as quickly. The story has a strong climax that builds powerfully.Very entertaining - and definitely worth a viewing."
1,I can't believe that anyone liked this movie,This was a big disappointment. Maybe Pacino's worst performance ever and Matthew McConaughey is a poor leading man. This movie dragged on. It was sooooooooooooo boring. I admit that I could not take it any more after an hour and dropped it after McConaughey was driving golf balls (he actually looked pretty good as a golfer) but how bad was Pacino's dialog? Then I wanted the guy to strangle McConaughey so this piece of trash would be over. It was so bad it wasn't laughable. Truly a terrible movie. What is with the other reviewers?
4,Fun story,"Just like just about any other Redwall book written that I have read, Pearls of Lutra is another fine example to the solidness of Brian Jacques' storytelling or the wonderful images and stories presented to us in the Redwall universe.If you like otters, you should enjoy this book. You also get to learn some neat things about their culture, or even more about other cool stuff in the Redwall world."
5,Never have I read such a good book since The Bellmaker!,"Martin the Warrior II, Clecky the hare, Welko and Plogg the shrews, Grath Longfletch the otterwife and Viola Bankvole set off to rescue the kidnapped Abbot Durral of Redwall. Across the seas at the ocean paradise of Sampetra, Ublaz Mad Eyes the evil pine marten is doing battle with Rasconza, and equally sly and crafty fox corsair. Back at Redwall, Tansy a hedgehogmaid is looking for the six Pearls of Lutra, what Ublaz wants, what Grath rightfully owns and what will cause pain and suffering for almost anybeast that claims the pearls (Grath's family died, a certain friend of Tansy's dies and let's not talk about what happens to Ublaz)."
1,Does NOT fit Husqvarna 435,I ordered this because the description says it fits the Husqvarna 435 chainsaw. This is not correct. This chain is WAAAAAY to short for the 435. I had to return it and buy the replacement chain at Lowe's for $20.
4,Like with limitations,"Overall, I like the product. Even though I knew the dimensions of the unit when I ordered it, it is still a bit disappointing that the compartments aren't quite tall enough to hold ""tall"" lipsticks. Regular, full diameter lipsticks fit perfectly, but the skinny ones tend to tip at an angle. The interior dimension of each compartment is 15/16 inches square, with about the same interior height."
3,Its a ok product,"i was really excited when i got the lipstick holder..the shipping was good.. i jus really hoped the lipsticks would be more secureinside each slot, and they are a bit big.. so i had to slant my lipsticks,its still a decent product im putting it to use.. im not super disapointed...ijust sucked it up and worked around the issue."
1,JUNK,Cannot reccomend this product. Made a mess on user and on floor. To top it all off this product CAN NOT be returned (cannot believe Amazon will not let me return a product that either does not work in the first place or is defective). Will not be using Amazon again.
2,fair but not durable,"My Lexmark 5700 did a fair job printing until the day an envelope got stuck in it. This rather common event has left the printer unable to print with black ink. I won't be buying a Lexmark again, they are far too fragile."
2,Mediocre from the get-go,"I got my Lexmark 5700 about 2 1/2 years ago. The black and white printing was great to start with, but the color printing never did turn out as good as prints from other printers, including my brother's Canon Bubblejet and my Dad's HP Deskjet.Color printing is somewhat better with a photo cartridge installed. Like one of the other reviewers, I have also, for the last 6 or 8 months, had significant problems with my black ink cartridges. The print quality is horrid. I just put in a brand new black cartridge, and one day later, the print is awful. There are skips all through my words. I don't know if this is a problem with the printer or the cartridges. If it's the cartridges, it's a big problem considering each black cartridge is about 28 to 30 dollars. Either way, I would not recommend this printer to anyone. I'm about 2 seconds from starting a bonfire with mine. Then I'm going shopping for something other than a Lexmark."
5,Harvey's message is simple and direct. Great book!!,This book encouraged me to achieve goals I never thought possible
2,Better products,I purchased this because of the price but I believe I wasted my money. It is good for small cameras or even a web camera. It did not extend as far as I needed and the handle is very stiff and not easy to use.
3,Strong but not flexible,I like slik and this mini tripod is strong for DSLRs but not practical. How many times will you have a perfectly flat large spot to place the tripod? The legs are not flexible and I eventually returned it.
2,What a freak - I have to leave the sound muted,"OK, I got this because there aren't a lot of videos that are doing by men or for men. I thought this would be more comfortable than something obviously marketed to women.I was wrong.While I have nothing against, Tai Chi for the exercise value, I am not into waving my arms around to usher ""waves of self love and acceptance"" over me. What a pile! Come on! Really?I think the audience would be better served without the psuedo-spiritual dung pile that accompanies any actual physical exercise. Besides working out my gut from laughter, I just don't see the benefit.Bottom line: the guy is a fruit. So if that's your thing, enjoy. Otherwise, steer clear...."
3,Not inspiring,"I bought this tape based on other reviews. I've been doing qigong for a long time and I wanted to try Tai Chi. I tried it before, but I found it nearly impossible to learn from the tape. All other reviews indicated that it was easy and you can follow it right away. It was certainly easier than the tapes I tried before, but the footwork was still difficult to follow. I could only do some of the exercises and the ones I did, I tried number of times, but I didn't feel any energy increase or anything to make me want to do it again. I think I am going to stay with qigong for now."
4,Good for begining,"The start of the DVD, where you have to go through all the company's crud that made the DVD, is really really annoying. Scott is fairly easy to follow, but I'm still not all the way through the DVD. I wish he went into some stretches, and how you're supposed to breathe and all a bit more; he goes a bit fast, sometimes. Which may seem a strange complaint, given he's moving in slooooow motion, but this is the very first time I've ever tried this stuff; I'm not just in it to learn the forms, I'm in a remote area and have no other way to learn this stuff. I guess I was hoping for a bit more of an introduction to Tai Chi; but if you already have a bit of experience in yoga or martial arts, and just want to learn & practice with the basic forms, this is a good DVD."
2,"Nice design, noisy pictures","The good: the camera was well made and very tiny. The menus were well designed. The all-internal lens was a neat idea. The use of an industry standard SD card made this camera the choice over the comparable Sony T1.The bad: Picture quality was a complete disappointment. The photos from this 5-megapixel camera were worse than my old 2-megapixel Fuji. As another reviewer indicated, the pictures are extremely noisy. Unfortunately, noise is apparently a problem in ultralight cameras like this one (a friend also reported unacceptable levels in the T1.) I returned this model and will get a larger camera - while the tiny design was neat, I personally feel that it's not worth sacrificing picture quality."
2,"Decent but fragile camera, terrible warranty service","I purchased the X50 and have been happy with it for the most part save its video mode which is sub par. However, I dropped the camera and even though there was no visible damage to the body the LCD screen was damaged internally with an odd shaped section of about half the pixels blank.I sent the camera in to Minolta warranty repair and it seems that to repair it they had to order a new LCD screen component from Japan. I've now been waiting 5 weeks (not including shipping time) for my camera. I find it totally unacceptable that the repair turn around is so slow. This is a current model with probably hundreds of thousands being shipped so why can't they have spare parts on hand in the US. Bottom line likely is that warranty repair is not profitable and therefor low priority."
3,"50, fifty","I bought two based on the review. The first cable I used it for the HD DVD to HD TV and it works great. Second cable I used it for HD cable to TV, and that one failed. I didn't test the failed cable to my first set up (DVD to TV) to make sure that it was, indeed, defective, but the cable that the cable company provided worked instantly."
5,Best Buy,"You can't beat this price. Best Buy cables went for more than $60 for the cheapest one. I bought 2 cables and have been using both on my Samsung 40""LCD for the Cable and DVD inputs."
5,great cable for great price!,i am using this cable for my PS3 and so far it's been perfect. Great cable for great price. can't beat it!
2,Seemingly very poor cable connector quality,"I bought two of these because they were so cheap and had high ratings. I used one to connect a PS3 to an HDTV. The cable ran out in the open to a tv in the middle of the room. After a few days of use the metal cable connector that inserts into the PS3 had ripped off of the cable, exposing the pins inside. Some force must have been exerted on the cable to do this, but it seems like that wouldn't have happened if the cable were higher quality. I gave this product 2 stars because as long as no strong forces are exerted on the cable, it works fine."
1,Not good,"I spent way too much time trying to work thru a complicated setup for my HD TV, theater sound system, satellite, and DVD only to find out that this cable was bad. I bought two of them, so to save further frustration, I replaced both of them with the expensive ones."
5,HDMI Cable Review,"These cables exceeded my expectations. They were very solidly built and felt like they were much more expensive cables than they were. I got three cables for less than $20 with shipping included. The picture quality from my HD Cable box and Progressive scan DVD player are excellent on my 52"" Samsung LCD. I can't wait to get a Blue Ray player to see what 1080p looks like. Overall, I would highly recommend these cables for anyone who does not need a name brand cable for 20x the price."
5,it gets the bits there,"This cable is now connecting my Scientific Atlanta cable box to my Philips 42"" plasma, and works without even the most minor of glitches.Simply put, it gets the bits from point A to point B, which, with a digital signal is all that matters. Highly recommended."
3,So so,"Shippng was great! However, when I plugged the cable in, it literally shifted the entire picture to the left cutting off about 25%. Picture quality was NOT improved with the cable and made me truly wonder about the whole HDMI hype. Colors easily dropped in quality when I tried using this. After a little work I was able to get this to thing to work properly. Good alternate to expensive ""gold plated"" cables out there, you will not notice the difference unless you sit 2 feet from the screen."
5,Works great!,"I bought a new monitor with an HDMI input for my computer. The cheapest HDMI cable I could find in the stores was over $20 and they went up in price from there... waaaaaay up! So I robbed the expensive HDMI cable I had on my BluRay player to use for my new monitor until this one arrived. When it did, the first thing I noticed was that the overall physical quality of the item was quite good. It certainly had the look and feel of the high-end cable I had been using. Once I swapped it out I could not tell any difference in performance or picture quality whatsoever. I think it goes without saying that for UNDER FOUR BUCKS INCLUDING SHIPPING you really can't go wrong with this cable. I'm very happy with the purchase!"
5,Right for the price,I was put off by the high price of HDMI cabes. So I ordered this one. Does a great job! I would buy another in the future if I needed it.
2,It stinks and I don't like it.,"I have bought cheap cables off of Amazon before and they were just fine. These cables on the other hand barley get the signal to your tv. The cable doesn't fit very tight in my brand new HD Tivo, so the cable has to sit just right to get the signal out. If you touch it or it wiggles its over."
4,It's a cable and it does what a cable should do. It does it well too.,Not much to be said about this cable. It works. I connected my HD Cable box with my HD TV and it worked. No problem.I'm giving 4-stars because this cable should be cheaper than this by now.
4,Don't waste your money on expensive cables,This is a great cable at a great price. Other stores want 3 or 4 times as much for the same quality cable. Don't be a sucker.
4,So far so good,"I have enjoyed the cable so far. The quality is no different than a cable I purchased for $30.00. The construction is not as finished as the more expensive cable, but it does the job."
5,Just what I needed,"This 10' HDMI cable what precisely what I needed, and at the right price. It was about 20x less than the same thing at Radio Shack, and it does the same job just fine."
1,DON'T NOT BUY!!!,Wish I could give minus stars! Waste of money! There is Picture but horrible distorted sound.. Spend a few bucks more I say for a working cable
1,poor hdmi,Hdmi would black out my tv and makes my tv blink i would send back but i don't want the hassle with
1,Not worth it,"They broke Day 1... ends came off. Not worth the trouble!Buy a decent Cable They got stuck in my HDMI port, poor fit and finish of ends"
5,Great value,I am very pleased with this cable. Its low cost and high performance make it a true value. No problems. Would purchase again and recommend to anyone.
1,Didn't buy for me.,I wish I would not get emails asking for these reviews. I didn't buy this for me and it's taking time I don't have.
5,Side splitting Fun,"This book is several years old; however, I reread it a couple times a year for the laughs! These old NFL stories are too funny! Do yourself a favor some evening: curl up with this book and prepare to laugh...wish Donovan would write another."
5,Barbie is BEWITCHED,"This is one of my favorite dolls in my collection. I am a fan of BEWITCHED. My Mom is also a fan of the show. I got into the show afew years ago :) The doll is beautiful and well detailed from head to toe. She also has her wedding ring painted on her finger. The box is beautiful too. A must have for any BEWITCHED fan young or old! Mine is displayed in her box, on my desk, and I can't get enough of her! If you haven't gotten your doll for your collection, get one!"
5,There are 2 versions of this doll. This one looks like Eliz. Montgomery,"I have wanted a Bewitched ""Barbie"" for a long time but the current one that is the latest version of her does not look like Samantha from the TV show. This doll version, I believe it is the one just before the latest model version, is so much nicer. The dolls face and hair style actually looks like Elizabeth Montgomery, while the latest version of this doll does not. It looks like a Barbie doll dressed up as a witch. Also, this version of the doll has a longer cape, nicer broom and overall is a better representation of the actress from the actual TV show. I grew up watching Bewitched and have fond memories of the show. The current Barbie version is such a disappointment. I don't understand why Mattel changed this dolls design. I recommend that you get this version of the doll if you want one that is a very good likeness of the actress. This one is hard to find and I consider myself lucky to find one at any price."
1,USELESS!!,"So full of garbage and NO real information. DON'T waste your money. My mother bought this book and I have gone through it along with the dvd (just him talking, no plans). The book is disorganized with no real schematics (plans) for building a distillery. I did better searching online for free. Plus who has a ton of corn, wheat, donuts, or any of the substances mentioned available. Save your money and fill-up your car. Because this book is useless."
3,Illustrated Brief History of Time,I ordered this book (Illustrated Brief History of Time)for collection. I have had this book (paper back)already. But the new book came and has a small tear on cover. I feel disappointed. I may need to buy another copy for collection... ...
2,Change of style,"When i first bought this album I kept asking myself is this the same Grits that did ""The Art of Translation?""If you like Verbs' newest album and DJ Maj's most recent mixtape, then you'll like this. I personally would not buy this album if I had the choice again. I loved Grits' last album, especially the songs ""be mine"" ""ooh aah"" ""believe"" and ""lovechild.""Its definately way different than I was hoping it would be. It seems that they changed their focus of culture. This album seems to be directed deep inner city... not my style, whereas ""The Art of Translation"" seemed to be more on the pop, hip-hop end.The music video that comes on the CD is all about the STUFF that Grits owns... they cruise around in Vegas and flash their spinners... necklaces... i got a question... where's God in all of this?Well its only like $13... the choice is yours."
1,Save Your Money,This was a waste of my and time I can never get back. This was a bad version of a paranormal documentary slash the movie paranormal activity. People don't just drop dead for no reason and the ending made no sense. Do not waste your money or time.
5,psyche-folk?....I dont THINK so!,"WOW! this set rips my heart out,rips my scrotum off,and rips a loud juicy one,all at the same time.now THATS music!"
4,Very well-written,"The characters in this novel are so well-drawn that you keep expecting to meet them in real life. You don't know for sure if you want to, but they become real all the same. Benedict is an intense study in conflicted emotions, and a brilliant creation.One of the added bonuses of this book is that in reading it, you even pick up some general genetic knowledge and trivia. For example, after reading this, the next time you meet someone's dog, you can say, ""Did you know dachsunds are achondroplastic, the canine equivalivent of dwarfs?"" You'll also get some interesting info on the mating of farm-raised fish that will change the way you look at your dinner. Best of all, though, this is just a really good read."
3,No Index!,"Collectible Teapots is a wonderful book if it only had an index. How can a book that has ""A Reference & Price Guide"" right under the title not have an index? I don't believe it is the fault of the author, Tina Carter, because she has a section titled ""Finding Your Teapot in this Book"" and the first sentence says ""If you want to find information on a specific teapot, the first place to look is in the Index."" Well there is no index.I called Krause Publications and the person I talked to suggested that it might have been cut out to keep the book a certain size. If that was the case somebody made a real bad decision. After you read through the book and then want to refer back to something you have to flip through the pages hoping to find it again."
5,A Clasic Comedy.,"Don Knotts and Tim Conway two of the best Comedy men in the bussiness, this timeless classic can be shared with the entire family as you watch them bumble there way to solve the mystery of Lord and Lady Morley's death. If your a fan of Don Knotts and Tim Conway you will love this film. I highly recommended it."
3,Yes you can re-visit your childhood,"My niece was looking for this video. She has fond childhood memories of watching this with her brothers when they were young, and wanted to share that with her children. We were happy to find it for her here at Amazon."
5,Never take yourself seriously,"Don Knotts and Tim Conway are the experts at not taking themselves seriously. The best way to give an understanding of how wild this movie is is to simply point out that comic genius Don Knotts plays the straightman to Tim Conway's magnificent imbecile. Of course none of it makes sense - it was never meant to! That's part of the joke. My family has worn out one copy of this video. Not even the classic 'Walk this way' from Young Frankenstein can match up to the take on that joke in this movie. My mother begins laughing at it several minutes before they actually perform it, it's so funny! I'm willing to bet Tim Conway made up the 'Wookalar' story on the spot, from the incredulous look Don Knotts gives him. Great double feature with Clue!"
4,Great classic comedy,"I only gave this 4 stars, which is an average of 5 for the always brilliant Tim Conway and 3 for the always annoying Don Knotts. Technically, this DVD isn't much, but the material is great stuff. It's been a favorite in my family for years. You know a great comedy when a single quote or reference is instantly recognizable and can start everyone in the room laughing. This one still does it for us."
5,The Ultimate Saturday Morning Matinee,"Highly amusing, often hilarious farce that is a must-own for any fan of Conway or Knotts. The two play bumbling Scotland Yard inspectors sent to a Gothic mansion in the English countryside to investigate a series of suspicious murders. They instantly find themselves amongst an array of screwball characters, hidden passageways, and ghostly encounters. Both actors are at their comic best here and work especially well with each other as they attempt to muddle their way through the mystery with riotous results. The scenes involving the carrier pigeons are especially hilarious."
2,Pointless -- wasted my time!,"I'm not sure why I finished reading this book -- I guess I kept thinking it would improve! However, the main character Ella was just too dumb to believe. The plot never got off the ground, and then it was disintegrated with these little short stories about how people resolved their conflicts or fell in love, at meals in the restaurant -- nothing really seemed to fit together. The people weren't as real as in Scarlet Feather. I felt this book was a waste of my time, wish I'd spent the time reading a better book."
3,Not as good as her others,"Maeve Binchy yet does it again with her masterful storytelling. However, I found this book a bit harder to follow than her last two. There were MANY characters to introduce and re-introduce, and this was very confusing. I also felt that she decided to just end the book, instead of develop two of the character's relationship better. That was also a little disappointing to me. I would recommend it but just keep in mind of all of the characters you have to keep track of."
2,Blech!!!,"This is the fourth Binchy book I've read, and I was soooo disappointed. Evening Class was the first, and it was so charming. I then read Tara Road, which I just loved. Silver Wedding was next, which was pretty boring. Then Quentins. I was looking so forward to this book, but it was almost awful. Ella, the main character, didn't have a brain in her head. She was so stupid and sickeningly sweet. I couldn't stand how her married lover kept calling her ""angel"". Yuck. And then when Nick & Sandy, who were working like dogs in their film studio, sent Ella to Manhatten to stay in a great hotel and be wined and dined by the film's potential financier - puhleeze! They do all the work, but then they send ""poor Ella"" to have all the fun! The story line was poor, and the characters, except for Deirdre were not very likeable. I'll wait before reading another Bincy. Too bad. I thought I had found a wonderful author."
2,Not as engaging as her other books ...,I could not finish the last 2 cassettes -- the plot meanders and the characters are stereotypical.
3,Quentins,"Mauve Binchy is not at her best in this novel. It is interesting in the beginning, but becomes confusing as she introduces new characters in the middle to the end of the book. Ella Brady is the main character. She is a struggling school teacher who gets tangled into an affair with a married man. He is not just an ordinary married man, but one who is rich and powerful. She soon realizes that despite his good nature and intelligence, he is involved in a scam to cheat all of his clients out of millions of dollars. As the scam unfolds, Ella realizes what she needs to do..."
3,Not one of her best,"I am not as enthusiastic about this book as some of the other readers have been. I simply could not manage to care for the characters, especially Ella Brady. I kept thinking, ""Well you dumb little tart, what did you expect!"" The characters seem to have no problem with adultery (they've all done it after all), and really, they seem to be lacking some very basic morals. I was not at all surprised how the story unfolded, and the ending wrapped itself up in a tidy (and predictable) package.If you want to read a really good Binchy book, try The Glass Lake for starters, then read the rest of her work. I really feel Tara Road was her last great book, with Scarlet Feather and Quentins pale follow-ups."
4,Weaver of characters,"Once again, Maeve weaves a tale with the best character descriptions of any author. The portraits she paints make Ella, her parents and the despicable Don Richardson so vivid that the reader feels a part of every scene from the first page. No one can tell a story better with better details. She is a master! However, the story line seemed a bit weak to me and only that aspect disappointed me. I knew mid way into the book what the outcome would be and that is unusual for a Binchy novel. I missed the element of surprise."
1,Please...No More!,"Usually enjoy Binchy's books....but can see why she had to be begged to write another. She has run out of ideas. The main character, Ella, makes anyone with a brain or a sense of social responsibilty want to slap her silly. It's not just the old, boring, getting involved with a married man theme.....but to belive that you would not let the authorities know about ""THE COMPUTER"" that was ""ACCIDENTALLY"" left behind.....pleasssssse! To think that all these other interesting characters would leap to her defense and help, including her screwed over parents, is just more than can be tolerated. Kind of makes you think they all are dumber than dirt. Please, no more until you can really put your heart in it."
3,Disappointing,"I eagerly looked forward to this novel since I heard Maeve Binchy was coming out of retirement. The whole story line with Ella just bored me. However, in Part 2 the book becomes interesting. I loved the reading that there really was a Quentin as well as Brenda's background. It was great how Maeve brought so many of the characters from her other books into this one. If not for Ella, the short stories would have garnered another star. This is not one of Binchy's best work."
2,"Even if you are a Binchy fan, this is one to skip","I've been a Maeve Binchy fan for years and was really looking forward to revisiting some old friends in her latest book. Unfortunately, ""Quentins"" does not measure up to Binchy's previous work. We meet our heroine Ella, raised by doting parents, and follow her as she strikes out on her own and into the arms of a married man, who - big surprise only to Ella - turns out to be a con artist. Meanwhile, Ella and her friends are making a documentary film about Dublin restaurant Quentins and the people who eat there. The main characters are poorly developed and the more engaging minor characters aren't given enough to do. Apparently Binchy couldn't decide whether to write a collection of short stories or a novel and instead has published an incoherent mixture of both. ""Quentins"" careens between syrupy vignettes of Irish life and a clumsy thriller subplot, all not-quite held together by the documentary theme. A real disappointment."
3,Not one of her best,"I have read every Maeve Binchy book from Light A Penny Candle on, and like many best-selling authors with a demanding public, she seems to deteriorate as time goes on. Light A Penny Candle is still her best, as far as I am concerned, because of its freshness and charm and care she took with her characters to make them seem completely believable and real.On the other hand, Quentins seems very formulaic. It is still a easy and pleasant read but I did not care very much about the characters. To be honest, I could barely remember which books the past characters had come from and so did not care very much that I was reintroduced to them. If she had explored in more detail the changes that come upon Ireland in the past few decades, perhaps through one family, that would have been a great story.This book may be more enjoyable for those unfamiliar with Ms. Binchy's earlier work, but for the rest of us, it is sadly disappointing."
4,A fun look at some favorite characters..,"The latest Binchy is the 'triumph over tragedy' tale of young Ella, who starts seeing a married man, and later begins to ask herself how much she really knows about him and his family. It was a bit slow at times, but did carry through somewhat to a satisfying ending.I really enjoyed the frequent reference to past Binchy characters such as Simon and Maude, Tom and Cathy, Ria Lynch, Brenda and Patrick, etc. The story leaves a little to be desired when compared to her earlier books, but it is written in true Maeve Binchy form, where even the worst can't be that bad."
2,Tedious and unconvincing,"Easy to put down, this is a far cry from what we are used to in a Maeve Binchy novel. Perhaps before again putting fingers to the keyboard, she ought remember what the doormouse said, ""feed your head."""
3,"It was a good, shallow beach read","Award-winning literature. No.A good,light,fun beach read. yes!I found it hard to put the book down, even thought I was thoroughly irritated with Ella. I couldn't wait to see what other stupid ideas she'd come up with......I am fan of Binchy now. This was the first book of hers I had read... I'm on to Tara Road next...http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org"
2,Not sure about this product,"I wasn't crazy about this product, it gave a strange after-taste and I'm a regular stevia user.I can't drink ice cold beverages, so drinking this at room temp was tough.I'm willing to try another glass or two before I say definately NO"
5,Great substitute for diet soda,"If you can get use to the stevia taste, this drink mix is outstanding. Mix with water, add ice and enjoy. I will be ordering more."
1,Poop is better than this video...,"First of all ALL VIDEOS ARE FROM THE EARLY TO MID 1990'S!I own five DVD's of this guy's mechanic how to series. Every single thing the previous review is 100% TRUE! I ordered from his website (Jason Varnums). The cases for the DVD's look better than the content. You can't hear ANYTHING when he is outside because of traffic, his wife is the camera operator. One HUGE annoyance is he cuts the camera in the middle of a sentence! For example he actually says, ""The next step in replacing""... thats it. CUT! There is pretty much zero lighting used under the car. I have seen better Youtube.com videos of teenagers! If you could give a ""Zero"" star rating it would get it by far!"
1,CRAP!,"Stay away from ALL of this guys videos!Poor lighting, you can't hear him taling, he cuts the recording when he is half way in a sentence, he recordsnext to a busy stret and you cant hear anything, he fixex cars all from the 1990's and earlyer. on and on and on about NOTHING! STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Blue-Gold Racial Issues,"HEART OF GOLD is Sharon Shinn's very obvious attempt to make socio-political commentary about the racial clashes in our society. However, her book is set on some other world where blue people, ""Indigos"", are the bigots that hold all the cards, and the ""Gulden"", yellow-skinned people, are the downtrodden race exploited by them. There are also some Albino people who are only mentioned in passing. On the cover, this is marketed as a love story, so I was eager to read it because I loved her angel books and Jenna Starborn. However, this book started very slowly and I found it very hard to ""get into it"". It has Shinn's typically thorough character development (perhaps hurt a little bit by preachiness), but I never could make myself believe the love connection between Nolan and Kit."
2,gear mechanism disappointing,"While I have owned the Pedrini salad spinner for at least a year and was fairly satisfied with it, recently the ""teeth"" pieces of the gear action started to break off. I found one in my garbage disposal after it severely jammed. This obviously isn't a spinner designed to last."
2,Overpriced low quality,"I bought 3 sets of these along with my new Earthlite table 3 years ago. They do not lie when they say they fit up to a 33"" table. I have a 35"" table and after 1 washing they were useless. Mind you every other brand of sheet I bought after this also said they fit 33"" tables, but they manage to work even after repeated washings. In short, these sheets shrink A LOT. They also fade quickly and have nothing over lower priced sheet sets. Absolutely nothing."
5,My Vice,"Oh, boy. These cookies are TOO good. I cannot put them down.This order is a lot of them. But the sleeves are wrapped individually, so they can live in the garage and come up one at a time (so you don't look like a fiend)."
5,Too good to pass up,"As other reviewers have pointed out, these are great cookies. The lemon and ginger flavors are perfectly combined. The only reason not to buy these cookies is because you fear the potential weight gain these addictive cookies might lead to. That said, these are worth working out a little more for."
2,Disappointing,"This album was lacking of substance. It should be filed under easy listening. Don't be fooled by the interesting packaging, in my opinion it is all fluff."
5,A GREAT little radio for the money,I am very impressed with this little radio. ...For the same money I could only get a bulky analog radio at [competitor]. This one has true digital tuning and not just auto scan. The digital readout is nice looking and easy to read and even comes with a light. 10 presets are cool but I wish it only had 4. To change from preset 2 to preset 1 you need to scroll through all 10 presets. But overall ...this is an EXCELLENT radio. I get great reception for all the major radio stations I listen to in my city. It even came with earphones!
4,digital radio,I used it for a church choir rehearsal and it was a bit difficult to keep the dial in the right station; but it did the job.
2,Bizare,Could not get into this movie. It was too bizare. I didn't even finish watching it. A dark movie...
4,GREAT BOOK!,"Really, great. i enjoyed it alot. i wouldn't say it's the best yet but it caught my attention and kept me wanting to read. i dont' like it when i read a dull book - and this one defently wasn't dull (with a TIGER in it and all). i'd recomend it."
1,"Mediocre writing, laughable reading","Pamela's worth reading only if you want to have a good laugh at the standard romance cliches and mock Pamela and Ty for the duration of the novel. The writing's not good, and the plot's even worse. But I'm very disturbed by the lack of Biblical principle found in this ""Christian"" novel. Pamela should have never started dating a non-Christian (Ty) in the first place! How can she berate herself for her feelings when she lets him grope her on the couch?But Pamela's hilarous reading--if you want to turn your brain off and fill it with romantic drivel and sappy cliches.I give it two thumbs up for unintentional humor."
2,Misleading Cover Photo,"The architecture depicted in this book looks nothing like the example on the cover. It's more of a colonial feel , instead of the contemporary tropical that I hoped for."
3,you don't need a fortune teller,"there is no reason to buy this cd, when 'I don't need a fortune teller' by the Ad Libs is available. It meets all the complaints about this compilation. when there was no other Ad Libs cd available, this was the one. but no longer. do yourself a favour and check out the other one. you won't regret it."
2,This story was mediocre,"I was rather dissapointed by this novel, most of the characters were unlikeable. The story line was fairly well drawn, but I found the character development was a bit abrupt. The author would shift into a memory without warning, leaving the reader adrift until the end of the memoir, when the charcter would ""wake up"" in the present tense of the story. The storyline itself kept me interested enough to finish the book, but I am glad I borrowed it from the library, rather than purchasing it, I do not intend to read this book again, and I do re-read many good stories"
1,Rip Off,"This is a total and complete rip-off! This is NOT a Nickel Creek CD. They are just the back-up band for Glen Phillips plus you can barely hear the band for the vocals. Well, another lesson learned about false advertising from a record company. No wonder we're all downloading and listening to satellite radio."
5,I Can Fo For All of It,Am rediscovering Hall and Oates and so pleasantly surprised. They have it all !!!!!!!!!!! Sophistication to the nth degree if you ask me. And both can really really sing. How they ever wrote these songs I don't know. Fabulous.
2,"Ouch and ""Huh""?","Let's see, now - this makes how many movies about lesbian couples with violent tendencies? Seems to me they're starting to outnumber films about lesbian couples who nurture or at least exhibit a more normal balance of light and dark attributes. To a point, women may be excited by female characters who do whatever they like. Butterfly Kisses, however, goes far beyond this point. While also disturbing, Heavenly Creatures is superior for its greater success at showing human complexity and for at least being drawn from reality. HC had its brilliant moments - moments that have stayed with me. Amanda Plummer's dead-on acting was my sole reason, along with mild curiosity re: the conclusion, for watching this in its entirety. Otherwise I'd advise against it unless you're turned on by violence and other disturbances."
1,waste of money,This game is perfect for a very young child. My daughter is 3 years old and loves Care Bears but does NOT like this game. Its boring. You barely need to know how to move the joystick. Its perfect for a 2yr old. If your kids are over 3 yrs. don't waste your money. The game that comes with it is a little difficult for her. I recommend Winnie the Pooh. Its very similar to the game that comes with the VSmile unit just a little easier. It holds her interest with frustrating her.
3,Care Bear game...It's Ok!,I have a 3 1/2 year old who is very advance for her age and this care bear game she really doesn't care for but the game that came with the v smile she will play hours on. The game is good but it doesn't hold her attention for very long.
4,having fun while learning with care bears,"Great product for beginning learners. Easy to navigate for young and old. Great animation and graphics. My daughter loves it. We recently went to visit my mother ... my daughter's grandmother in another state. We had just taken off in the airplane when my 3 year old daughter said, ""mommy, I thought we were going to see grammy."" I replied that we are. Then my daughter says, ""we are going to see the care bears first...look at the clouds...where are the care bears?"" It was the best. She expected to see the care bears jumping from cloud to cloud like they do in the game."
3,Snore,"This isn't a bad game, it's just dull. Our 4 year-old avoids it but our 2 year-old loves it. You can't loose in any of the activities, so it is a good learning game, but it is easily the one that will be outgrown first. If you buy the V-Smile system for a very young child (2-3) you may want this one. Four year-olds and beyond will be incredibly bored by it. Go for Winnie-the-Pooh or Lion King instead and you'll get more bang for your buck."
2,Cute but a little dull,"Grey color is nice.Shaft a little short and bigger.Shaft cuts off at unattractive place on calf. Not fitted but not the cool shaft that fits a little loose like a motorcycle boot. Cute but boring, Comfortable fit but doesn't look good with mini skirts. I liked Mia better. Also loved kenneth cole wanna ride boots. They have more style. I am not a rocker or a biker but low heel boots should have character."
3,hard cover,great book great delivery only bad thing is i received a paper back issue always order hard cover
3,Angelfish Book Review,"This book is the same as the authors' The Guide to Owning Angelfish: Disease, Varieties, Care, Species, Breeding. The only difference is the title, binding and cost. Buy The Guide... instead.Both seem a bit slim on information as all Axelrod/Tetra books are."
3,Works for me.,"I would describe myself as an intermediate or above actionscript programmer and this book was very useful to me. I do agree that a beginner would get lost quickly and it is lacking in tutorials, but for someone who already has a good foundation in AS and wants to extend their knowledge, this book has quite a bit to offer.I found especially useful the sections that introduce using xml, Coldfusion and php with Flash and the introduction of the new video and tweening enhancements in Flash 8. The section on custom classes and also the best practices for scripting has helped me as well. The code in this book is written much better than anything I've seen in the Lynda series, Visual Quickstart, or Friends of Ed, all of which are very basic and sometimes contain bad code. If you're seroius about AS programming, I recommend this title."
4,excellent buy,"Excellent photography, interesting text, much of it a ""down inside the canyon"" perspective. Only evolutionary zealots are likely to be offended; the rest of us will find this a lot of book for the dollar."
1,Creationist propaganda dressed with beautiful pictures,"It's hard to find a place to begin with criticizing this work, since there are so many things to criticize. The biblical literalism masquerading as sham ""science"" ruins the enjoyable photography. And the absurd lengths that the authors go to fabricate reasons that jibe with their unprovable beliefs is disappointing as well as darkly amusing.If you wish to reinforce your creationist delusion, this book will sooth you. If you want to learn about how God actually created the Grand Canyon, look elsewhere."
1,proof,"If you want beautiful pictues of the grand canyon, buy this book. If you want science, don't.It has been said earlier that he will give out $1,000,000 to anyone who can prove there is no god.What a ridiculous concept, you do not form a hypothesis, and then see if it can be proved wrong. You form a hypothesis, then see if it can be proved correct!I could write a book saying earth was created by the[...]of some giant blue monkeys. I'll give $1,000,000 to anyone who can prove it wasn't."
2,"Great photos, Religious dogma","Loved the photos (which were taken by a camera designed by many scientists and inventors). As to the notion that the Canyon conforms to the biblical creation myth, not much scientific evidence to support the belief. There is evidence of flooding within the Canyon after failure of damns formed when volcanic lava created natural blockage in the Colorado and the power of moving water caused these lava damns to later collapse. This is much different than stretching Noah's flood to the Colorado plateau. The Canyon was formed by geological processes over millions of years and not in conformance to religious documents written by King James scholars a few hundred years ago. If you believe the Creationists, you'll love both the text and the photos. If you favor logic and the scientific method, you'll relish the photos."
1,Noah's Flood in the Grand Canyon?,"The beautiful photographs of the Grand Canyon in this book are attractive. However the text pretends to discuss the geology of the area but does so only from the point of view its biblical literalist authors. It asserts that the Canyon and most of its rocks formed in Noah's Flood, 4,000 years ago. This book espouses both bad science and bad theology under one cover."
4,Good family entertainment,"This is a good, clean, wholesome family movie, made in the Hallmark tradition, and based on the book, ""The Swiss Fmily Robinson."" You pretty much know the story already, but the movie is different enough to keep your interest. The acting and production are very good, and the scenery is superior."
2,"Good, at the beginning.","I bought this item three years ago to replace a similar unit that had failed -- oddly enough for the same reasons I'm finally replacing this one. The unit started off well enough, playing CDs as I fell asleep. However, after 6-8 months of regular, but hardly abusive use, the CD player no longer recognized discs.The multi-voltage is helpful, though the clock does lose/gain time if the power isn't running clean.The dual alarm works great, when it keeps time. And the snooze button is easy to hit.In these last few weeks, I've found that the analog tuner tends to drift off station.After going through two vertical-loading CD clock radios, I think I'd recommend against that style. The construction is solid and long lasting, even if the technology inside isn't."
4,Deep and Thoughtful No,"Gold, Steps greatest hits is a must for any party loving girls who like to dance the night away around their handbags wearing high heels. With all the favorites like Tragedy and Chain Reaction this is a great CD for getting ready for a night out with your friends. Full of happy upbeat tunes to lift anyone,s spirits."
5,Bill Does It Again,"Runaway is Bill Champlin's second solo album and very hard to find on cd at a reasonable price. As good as this album is $75 is too much for any cd for that matter. This album is very similar to Bill's first solo album Single-1978. David Foster Produced both albums and they sound great. This album contains a few balladsThe Fool Is All Alone, Tonight Tonight. The rest of the album is full of uptempo rockers. Of all the past and current members of Chicago's solo albums Bill's albums are the strongest. For everyone that complained about his tenure in Chicago i dont think Bill cares too much about being let go. He is a busy man touring with The Sons Of Champlin and doing his own solo stuff. He released a solo album two years ago called No Place Left To Fall if you are a fan check it out."
4,1973 FLASHBACK,I was graduating from high school during the early years of the songs on the DVD were originally released. This brings back a lot of great memories. The music is still ahead of its time even with today's standards. High quality music that sounds better than ever.
5,The Magnificent Irish Wolfhound,The Magnificent Irish Wolfhound (A Ringpress Dog Book of Distinction)This book is the BEST...Everything is covered in easy to understand and quick language...I was able to find any answer to any question quick and easy...I highly recommend it..
2,short lived,"I had this coffe maker for a little over a year. Yes the coffee was good, but I wouldn't say it was the best ever. It's a loud machine. Is an absolute pain to clean & even at that you can't clean it that well as nothing removes except the grinder filter (metal cage) the filter basket & that's it. Just wiping down the grinder blades is usless. It takes up entirely too much room on the counter & must be left open to air dry thouroghly. After 6 months the plastic coffe basket broken. Then all of a sudden it started to over steam & produce half the amount of coffee vs. the amount of water added in, (6 cups of water yielded 3 cups of very strong coffee). I called & found that they have stopped making this model & all combo models as too many people are complaining about the maintenance & such. I am going back to my braun coffee maker with separate grinder. The coffee is better & the mornings aren't so distruptive. It's not that much more to grind seperately & it's easker to clean everything."
1,KRUPS has discontinued...,Called today since ours actually gave up the ghost after 6 months of struggling... Krups is replacing with a separate grinder and coffee maker - it should arrive in another 2-3 weeks.
1,Thanks for the low down on a low down!,"I have been offered this coffee maker through Amazon.com as part of their Gold Box promotion. I read all the reviews and I'm glad I did. It sounds like an absolute piece of junk!I appreciate honest reviews when it comes to products advertised on-line, and I'm glad I saw these ones.I will continue to look around for a great cup of coffee aside from the local Tim Horton's (No he's not the Prime Minister of Canada . . . lol)Thanks again for your honest reviews."
1,Performance Decreased Rapidly and then Machine Broke,"From the start this product was disappointing. It was difficult to clean the grinder after brewing. Then over the next few weeks, the coffee maker started steaming alot and thus brewed too little coffe and took an inordinately long time to do so. Then, it just broke. The grinder would no longer work. I took it to a Service Center for warranty work and was told that Krups does not fix these machines and will just send me a new one. Almost four weeks later I received a different coffee maker that did not grind and a seperate grinder. This is what I started with. Now I have two regular coffee makers and two grinders and cannot get anyone at Krups to talk to me, call me back or respond in any way. I will auction the new products on EBAY and will never buy another Krups product. It was not the lousy product as much as the complete lack of customer service that brought me to that decision."
1,Bad! Bad! Bad!,"The whole movie was bad. I kept thinking we were watching something besides the movie. The presentation was terrible and the first 20 min. were slow and dull. It certainly was not scary as, even where the monster bit the girl, didn't look like a real injury. My daughter gave the DVD to me for Mother's Day. Boy, was I disappointed in it. My husband and I both agreed on how bad it was. I wouldn't even give it one star if I didn't have to."
2,"could have been good, had it's moments","i bought 'Cloverfield' on dvd today- i'm glad i bought it with points, i'd have been TICKED if i'd paid for it. it didn't completely suck, but if you thought it looked like a really good monster movie you were wrong. i thought so, and was wrong. it was shot in the 'blair witch' style, nauseating shaky camera that never sits still and takes the bold move (for an action flick) of virtually NEVER showing the action. i guess it's supposed to look 'real' but it was just too gimmicky. i garantee there is as much total darkness and/or shots of the sidewalk as anything else. i'd say 40% off centered bad acting, 5% scary monster (just his legs & back, tho... lord knows i HATE seeing the monster in a monster flick, gosh) and the remaining 55% is black sky, black streets, dust, debris... you get the idea. i'd have walked out on it in the theater long before it got to the cool parts."
2,Waste of money and time,"Cloverfield has to be the worst movie of the decade. This movie could have been made using standard filming and still would have been bad. The story is so predictable and ""Deja Vu"". A pure disapointment for me. The only thing it has going for is the special effects and the unusual ending (Everybody dies). Total waste of time and money."
1,Worst Plot and Camera Shaking,"I would not give this movie more than a few sentences due to it's lack of real entertainment. If anyone watched The Blairwitch Project then you would know how anoying it is to watch a movie with the camera moving all over the place. Well that movie was not too bad but this one takes the cake. I almost left the movie theatre just like many other people did. I was born and raised in NY and this movie does not match it's locations as they are traveling up north in Manhattan. Gee the monster must have had it's traking device on these kids. When I was a kid we used to go to the midnight showings of scary movies. I used to go all the time with friends to watch ""Night of the Living Dead"". Those were good movies. This does not compare to ANY good scary flick. Don't waste your time or money. It does not even deserve ONE star."
5,Excellent monster flick!,"This movie was extremely well done... the terror of the people in the film going through what they were was perfectly put together. I don't understand the complaints on the movement/stabilization needed... I thought the effect of the movie being filmed on video camera added to the terrifying feeling trying to be captured.. what these people are going through during something horrible. I admit that I am not a fan of Blair Witch and was hesitant about the way this was filmed at first (before seeing it), but I thought with this movie it absolutely worked. The movie was not over done at all. The characters are great, and JJ Abrams (creator of LOST) is wonderful as always. The hidden meanings are always fun to figure out. But overall the movie really was well done. If motion of a camera is something that makes you feel sick, then I would suggest not to watch."
2,Cloverfield manages to be awesome and terrible at the same time.,"This movie has 3 major problems:1 - It takes entirely too long for the monster thing to attack, up to that point it's a How To guide for anyone who wants to write a pathetically boring Relationship struggle movie.2 - Once the truly interesting part of the film begins, it all ends far to quickly. And Even though the Idea of keeping the Monster largely off camera is pretty compelling, a lot of the shaking camera stuff failed to enthrall me as much as give me a migraine.3 - I guess I'm not allowed to share spoilers, so let me just say, the plot (besides the ""Giant Monster in Manhattan"" bit) is just awful and I'll leave it at that.However, visuals, audio, and the rest were overall entertaining. This is not a bad movie, but check your brain at the door."
3,Great when there's not much else on !,"Finding a used copy of Cloverfield is the best way to watch this movie. If you're the least bit curious about the movie, as I was, grab a cheap used copy, a bowl of popcorn, and a few captain & cokes, and enjoy !"
3,A Big Disappoint,"I was very disappoint with this movie, because they had this big hype for the trailer. And I went to watch it at the theater, the movie remind me of watch godzilla."
2,Godzilla meets the Blair Witch Project,"Not the worst movie ever made, but the intentionally jerky camera work is annoying. They spent some money making it, and the special effects are good, if you can get past the camera work, I couldn't. At least the equally disappointing Blair Witch Project had an excuse (for the camera work, not the story line), no budget. I didn't like the lack of explanation for what was happening either. Normally, part of my enjoyment of a film is when they tie everything together and you understand what is happening. It's a cop out when they ""leave it to your imagination"", meaning they didn't have the imagination to tie it all together."
2,Cloverfield Headache,I have not seen the complete movie. I cannot watch it without large doses of Dramamine and someone to explain what's happening. Very confusing.
1,Save Your Money,"I paid seven bucks to see this movie in a theater. There is no way I will spend another dime on renting or buying this ______(fill in the blank}, either in standard definition or high definition. Blu Ray? You've got to be joking? What for? Right away, I saw what the producers had in mind which was okay for the first fifteen minutes, but then it went on and on; I got really weary. In that regard, the producers failed to pull off what it was trying to accomplish. The story was okay if you like Godzilla movies, I do, but the story wasn't the problem, the presentation was. In my opinion, the producers should have stopped at a logical place and had a transition to coventional movie making story telling. If they had done that, I would have probably bought the Blu Ray and would have given this movie three and a half or four stars."
2,Invincible Monster,"I personally think there were a lot of problems with this one. The person holding the camera for most of the movie was insanely annoying. Even during the disaster, he was making jokes and saying things like ""ROB, ROB, ROB, ROB,"" and ""You guys see that?"" The monster was continuously being attacked by machine guns, missles, and bombs and it never got a scratch. Throughout the movie, wherever the main characters were, so was the monster. How could the monster ""know"" where they were all the time? During the rescue attempt, the chopper flies close above the monster; how dumb can you be? Since you only see what the video camera sees, a lot of the story is left out and you only know what the person holding the camera knows; therefore, nothing is explained at all. The amazing thing about the movie was the computer graphics, which simulated new york city very well."
1,another Godzilla spin off that stinks,"Ok enough with the cutting edge cinematography! The story was recycled.The EFX were dreadful. A perfect movie for the lemming, cubicle commando, mochachino guzzling generation Y kids. It makes you dizzy and feeling broke.Sort of like a bad night in TJ . As if Mathew Broderick didnt screw up the last American giant monster movie enough. Save your money dont buy it!or better yet buy a BOOTLEG!"
1,Get a Barf Bag Ready,"Simply put, this movie is terrible. About 15 minutes into it you will be reaching for a Barf Bag. It is video camera style shooting from start to finish. Jerky hard to watch and nauseating. Save your money for something better."
1,handheld cameras a movie do not make.,"Cloverfieldthis could've been a good movie if they had not shot the entire thing by use of someone's hand held camera. The special effects were adequate, what you could see of them, and the plot was fair; but I can not comply with the thought that filming the entire movie with a handheld camera is artistic. Rent this one first, then decide."
1,FXSpringer01,"Filmed by a five year old with a hand-held camera. Blair Witch Bad! Story line is not bad, but don't waste your money."
1,Worst flim ever,After all the hype and previews and ads I said it looks good so i will take a look big mistake this film ( and i use this term loosely is so bad i lost brain cells watching it.No explanation no real plot just bad filming from a cam corder plus a lot of unbelievable scenes . The gave away all the best in the previews and showed what was 1 1/2 hours of idiots running around with a grand total of 45 seconds maybe one minute of monster footage come on two guys in basement could have come up with better with a camera a computer and ten pounds of play doh
4,CLOVERFIELD,"I liked this movie even though the camera was on constant tilt. I bought a new copy because my other one was lost at a relatives house. But, it's cool-they are reimbursing me! Would like to see ""CLOVERFIELD TWO"". Just hope the find someone who can hold a camera straight!"
3,Decidely Average,"Hey, it's not terribly awful. Just a bit lacking in the ""story"" department. By which I mean someone should have invested a little more time in trying to come up with an actual ending, that, in the time-honored fashion, kind of resolves most things in the film in a way that we the viewers might find entertaining.Now I'm not saying the ending doesn't fit. It's just not very entertaining. It's the kind of an ending that highlights the difference between a film with an ending and a film that just ends.I wouldn't recommend buying Cloverfield, though it's probably worth watching once. I happened to catch it on one of the MTV channels on Halloween at like two in the morning. I felt in a mood to watch whatever might be on TV. And I could have done a lot worse.Dracula 3000 would have been a lot worse."
4,"Actually, quite good","I was a little wary to watch this movie because I'd heard a few negative things about it. Nonetheless I kept an open mind and I am glad I did -- this movie is actually very good. Cleverly shot (think Blair Witch on steroids, but not so dramatic that it distracts), it also adeptly delves into the emotions of all the characters. I wasn't frightened so much as I was tense, and also invested in the fate of all involved. Above all else, it was a touching story.I recommend this movie. And if you've heard anything negative about it like I had, forget about it -- you'll be pleasantly surprised."
1,Waste Of Time,"This movie's not worth the time at all, the whole thing with the camera makes you dizzy as all hell, totally makes you want to shut the movie off and throw it out, good special effects though. Acting is way overdone, and everyone happens to be ""gorgeous"", not one average looking person! Film crew tried way too hard on this one. Not to mention that the ending was terrible, I would not see this picture again. Was not even worth the .88 cents I bought it for!"
3,Torn,"I'm torn on which way to go with this movie. The pace and energy are really good, with some selfish, self obsessed posers getting their comeuppance - always a winner in my book. The 'monster' is interesting, the effects impressive. BUT - the hand-held 'Blair Witch Project' angle was annoying to begin with, and it hasn't improved with age. And even though I'm on the other side of the pond, even I recognised a moment of pure, unforgivable tastelessness when the dust came rolling down the street, a la the 9/11 rip off. Not good. If they hadn't tried to be so 'clever', or cheapen 9/11, I'd have given it five stars. And there's a difference between 'homage' and re-hash.Yours,Baby Cromwell"
1,WEAK.,"Cloverfield is not clever. It is not the first time that a film has used the gimmick of being shot by handheld camera. A better movie to have been done in this style would be The Blair Witch Project. At least The Blair Witch didn't give me a headache, and was actually creepy in the end.Cloverfield is not terrifying. I was not on the edge of my seat. I did not care about the characters. The monsters were not very frightening. It lacks intensity.Cloverfield is not worth your time or money. The whole beginning of the film is worthless. They wait way too long to bring in the monsters. There's this big part about this guy's girlfriend that is boring and you will not care about that takes up a long time. That beginning part should be introducing you to the characters and making you care about what happens to them, but it is not effective in doing that at all.I wish I had skipped this one."
1,A Blair Witch Project with a Final Destination Ending,"And some supposed story about something that looks like the queen creature from ""The Faculty"" and deadly, must be, sea-spiders who always of course come ashore whenever the sound of havoc reaches them in the depths below."
1,I truly had to stop watching it was so bad.,"Horrendous. First off, it uses the old ""shaky cam"" nonsense, which went out of style many years ago. Please, folks - only Blair Witch made that work. I don't like gore, and I don't like heavy violence, and there was none of that in this movie - it was PG-13 for a reason - but you see nothing, and you understand nothing. The lousy shaky cam nonsense is bad enough to make you close your eyes in parts, the acting is awful and the plot non-existent. If you are over 15, forget it, what a complete waste. This is one of maybe 4 movies in my entire life I turned off out of simple boredom after about 40 minutes. Just awful."
3,"If you enjoyed the film, this is nice to own.","Been looking forward to adding this to my BRD collection for a while now. Picked up for a decent price on black friday. Not going to say this is some ""End all - be all"" BR release. But, if you like the movie as I did, and you'd like to add it to your library, this is more than adequate! Solid release."
1,Worst Movie of 2008,"I have to say that this absolutely the worst movie of 2008. Paramount should have learned its lesson from Sony Pictures Entertainment Corporation during their debacle of their Godzilla (1998) movie adaption. Their viral campaign showed very little of the monster until the day of the movie and it ended up bombing, not making much more than Cloverfield did.To make things worse, Matt Reeves took what could have a wonderful creature movie and turned it into a rollercoaster ride of nauseated dizzyness. Now, there's talk of a sequel filmed with a different point of view? Matt Reeves is making a mockery of the Movie Industry in Hollywood.Even the filming style was completely un-original ...If you want to see a real monster movie, stick with the originals ... Godzilla, Gamera, King Kong. At least with these movies, you won't become nauseated by the constant shaking of the camera."
1,Waste of time,This has to be one of the worst movies ever. Believe me don't waste your time. If you can get past the first 45 minutes you win...I couldn't.
3,Duracell or Eveready?,I want to know the make of that camcorder! And the battery it used. Wow. It just kept going and going. This film is a bore. Don't waste your time unless you've got time to waste.
1,Ugh not another Blair Witch Project,"I maybe little bias since I could only watch 30 minutes. I have one or two complaints about this movie.1) The camera movements were all of over the place. The movements of the camera made me sick and dizzy. I was hoping it would calm down, but didn't. And it looks like others had the same complaint. I know it's suppose to be a documentary style but documentaries don't have to be that jumpy.2) The Story line was just plainly stupid. This is a movie that took itself to seriously and tried to make something out of nothing.3) The acting wasn't believable. IF you're going to make a movie like this and use unknown actors. At least get top of the line acting since this maybe their big break. Not the ones the movie used since this maybe and only movie they make.4) Not another Blair Witch Project. Hasn't Hollywood learned it's lesson.....yet. I guess as long as they're making money, they don't care."
2,Too Odd,I just did not care for the film at all. It was very strange and a bit odd. It was Sci Fi gone wild.
2,A Traveler Fan Review,Yawn!!!!!!!!!!!! Unless hypo-n-tech is your forte you'll find this compiliation down right boring. Not a single song stands out. Disappointing.
4,"So far, so good","Bought the base unit, plus two expansion phones; so far the 'system' has been reliable, the range is considerably better than my previous 2.4gHz Panasonic (which might have been suffering from conflict with my wireless router) and reception/transmission quality seems to be very good."
4,Fabulous Adventure,"Thank you, NetGalley and Bell Bridge Books, for the opportunity to read HEART OF THE TIGER.Gosh, Jermyn, the Duke of Tallant, is a horrible person. EVERYONE wants him dead, from his wife, to his brother, his daughters, Miranda (his neighbor) to basically everyone who meets him.There is much disappointment when he turns up dead and those that wanted him so didn't get to do it.This book is about Miranda and Michael, the new Duke...and what they want, what they wish for, and their hopes and dreams for the future, now that revenge is no longer attainable.There's some mystic moments that kept me guessing...there's some HEAT that kept me wanting more...there is the challenge of these two finding their home with each other. Lots of moments that kept me clicking through the pages on my kindle.Very enjoyable and I want to see more from Lynn Kersten!"
2,Love Potions and Charms! I don't think so!,"Don't waste you money. I thought I could become a more powerful seducer. But I did not learn anything new! We ALL know that chocolate and alchol are aphrodisiacs. I gave this book a 2 because the artwork and layout saved it! Beautiful pictures of herbs, and things, but if you want to learn to seduce, look some place else."

3,Fun for a short while,"This game is still fun despite the poor graphics and poor equipment, but what makes the game not worth the money is the number of words available for play. The game is supposed to have 1500 words in its database, but after playing each difficulty level once or twice, all the words were repeats. After two days we cannot play anymore."
2,Terribe Graphics,"I thought this was going to be great...that it was about time, someone thought this up...then when my boyfriend bought this for me and we played it one night with our family, we hated it. The graphics were absolutely horrific. We will go back to playing the old way...with a big tablet of paper and a sharpie sitting around the living room."
1,They Really Ought To Be Ashamed,"As echoed by every other reviewer reviewing this product, the drawing device is terrible. It's impossible to draw even the most rudimentary objects on the pad. The graphics are pixilated and outdated at the very least. And as far as I'm concerned, the word choices are poor, too. C'mon, one of the words to draw on easy mode was ""Double."" That's an abstract concept at best. The people who released this product HAD to have known how poor their product was, yet thought so little of their buying audience that they released it anyway. Horrible design and horrible execution."
1,Not a real VB.NET,"I was very disappointed with this book.This is not for real developers and it is a pretty poor introduction into VB.Net world for the beginners: this book is adopted from the previous versions VB to the NET without consideration of completely new features of the new environment. Yes, some of them are mentioned as a ""Upgrade Notes"", but examples and real step-by-step tutorials are still based on old VB5(!) syntax ( adopted to NET).One of the examples - text file handling: just a mention about StreamReader class and no examples how to use it instead of the old version of FileOpen, that took at least 10 pages.Another fluke - explanation ByREF vs. ByVal - I would say it is misleading - this chapter belongs to VB5/VB6 environment, not to the NET.Those are only 2 examples, I could list much more than that.I definitely do not recommend this book to anyone - nor beginners - nor experienced programmers who were hoping ( like me) to jump into VB.NET world with this book."
4,Beginners Only,"If you are an experienced developer, particularly with VB, this is NOT the book to buy. I recommend Cornell and Morrison's Programming VB.Net: A Guide for Experienced Developers. However, if you are new to programming, I highly recommend this book. It presents basic subject matter in a clear and readable style. Additionally, the author steps the reader ""step-by-step"" through how to perform basic programming tasks in the VB .Net environment. I have taught hundreds of students how to develop in Visual Basic, and although this is not the BEST book out there, my students have really enjoyed and benefited greatly from this material."
3,Decent Book for Transition from VB6 to .NET,"This book was assigned as part of a MS Certification program that I enrolled in at Techskills. While the author did a good job of describing the differences between the two VB version (6 and .NET), the meat of the book was very basic. It included one real world example that it built on throughout the book, so it makes a very poor reference once you've been through it once.I also used the ""Developing Windows Based Applications with VB.NET and VC#.NET"" which offered a much broader foundation to work from.To supplement the ""Step by Step"" book I also purchased the ""VB.NET Language Reference"" to use as well, ... a reference. All the books mentioned are Microsoft Press Books, and I did pass the exams, so..."
3,only covers the basics,"This book only covers the basics. It starts being literally ""step by step"" to the point of being annoying (you don't need a full page of text to realize how a control is added to the designer!). Unless you're a real beginner at computers it'll get to your nerves and you'll want to jump entire paragraphs. Then, you get to some interesting subjects like reading and writing to a database. This book teaches you to do so using a wizard. I have nothing against wizards as long as they work. But if you try using this wizard against a MySQL or a DB2 database you'll probably find some problems. You'll have to do it all by hand and this book doesn't teach you that.OK, you still learn some things with it but you'll need another book to get deeper to OO and ADO."
2,Not for an experienced developer - Great for 5th-grade students.,"I've been a developer for more than 20 years, moved off to management about 4-5 years ago. So I decided to learn .net {previous experience with Delphi and VB) by acquiring the Deluxe Learning Edition of VB .net 2003. I found this book to be very difficult to get through because it was entirely too basic. If anyone is serious about doing computer programming, the authors should at least assume the reader knows and understands something - this book's audience appeared to be for middle school readers, not people aspiring to be computer programmers. Beginning Visual Web Programming in VB.NET {from Novice to Professional} is far superior and doesn't leave me feeling like a fourth grader."
4,Saw it - Liked it - See it again...,"Absolutely, this is not great art, but it is entertaining. They have the right actor for the part and just enough over the top action to make this a fun ride. My husband and I have enjoyed both movies in this series and are worth seeing again and again.It is going in our video library next to Seargent York, Hellfighters, LOTR, Sliding Doors, and Mulan."
2,really disappointing,"Movies like The Transporter shouldn't have a sequel. The first one is always the original and the best.The transporter 2 is absurd, surreal, there's no plot, it's just action and things far away from being possible in real life.Really really disappointing."
3,Action (and Jason)!,"Jason's hot and the action is constant in this sequel. Not as many cool fight scenes as the first, but still fun to watch."
3,Kickin Action,"The first Transporter movie is one of my favorites, so naturally I had to get this one. I purchased this movie without viewing before (remember, loved the first) and was not disappointed. I read other reviews here about the film and found that I agreed with some others about some of the stunts being a little far-fetched. However, overall I found it to be the same high intensity action and appeal as the last one. Jason Statham looks amazing in this film and has the same gritty personality as before but in this film...you see a small crack. I also found that they didn't follow the trend involving the love life part of the plot for Frank. Overall, I enjoyed this movie and was happy with my purchase."
5,Fantastic,"Fantastic audio and video quality. Like Transporter 3 DVD I have, this is also a double sided DVD, which is, one side having wide screen version of the movie, and the Full screen version on the other side. So I'm going to give the same advice as I have given to the Transporter 3 DVD. Don't touch or scratch the surface of the DVD!!"
1,THE TECH SPECS FOR THIS DVD ARE NOT TRUE,NO DTS SOUNDTRACKNON OF THOSE TRAILERS IT MENTIONS NO X-3 NOR ARAGON
1,Check for dead flat before purchase!!!,"I would not buy this plate. I bought one, and it was not flat. From the center to the edge the plate drooped at least 1/16th of an inch. I returned the plate to the store where I purchased (not an online purchase) and got another one in exchange. Before I left the store I had the salesman check it for flatness, SAME PROBLEM. He opened a third, and it was also not flat.I can't imagine this was designed this way. Just for kicks I took it home and installed it on my router, and put it in my router table (the salesman was interested in the little experiment I wanted to try). It did not flatten the plate. I had some problems with the test cuts because the plate was not flat.I typically do not right reviews for products unless I am not satisfied. The store let me exchange the third plate for a different brand made out of aluminum. I checked it for flatness before I left the store, and it was flat.Just want folks looking at this one to beware."
1,dont waste your money,"Crown in plate makes it pretty much useless. I set the plate on my table saw & it actually rocked. When I called Rousseau they wasted more of my time by telling me they would send me another, Yeah another crowned plate. I liken buying this plate to buying bent drill bits"
2,Don't bother,"The insert is as advertised but there is no sense paying for the name when the same product (without the bubble) can be had at Harbot Freight for 1/2 the cost. I use it but in the future I will opt for the aluminum insert +$ or the generic version -$. The install was easy once I tossed the instructions. It works, it is well made, the inserts require a dead-blow hammer to remove and I will not purchase another."
2,Poor Quality Rings (updated),"I have used this plate for 2 years now and it stinks. The crown in the plate is ok ... I don't mind that, but the snap in rings are a bear. You have to use a hammer and hit it hard to snap them in and out. Last night I was hammering them out and the whole plate shattered. Now looking at Rousseau's higher quality router lift I find that it has the exact same plastic top and the exact same snap in rings. Being a weird sized plate means I'm now going to have to re-build the top of my router table to accept a better quality router plate. Spend the extra cash and get an aluminum plate with quality snap in rings. Also Rousseau's customer service is a nightmare. This has a lifetime warrantee so I called to get get a free replacement after I broke it. 3 months and numerous phone calls later I FINALLY got a new one from them ... with the same stupid problem."
4,Just another opinion,"Some people say the movie was better, some people say the book was better. I'd say in terms of quality, they're about equal. The book is a bit different (for example Norman being a fat sweaty nervous guy and not a tall, thin, nervous guy). There is a little less about Mary in the novel, but I think there is more about Sam and Mary's sister. Unfortunately, as I was born long after Psycho become engrained in our culture, the end didn't surprise me, or really even disturb me, though I liked the way it was presented in the book more than the movie. It's a good, quick read if that's what your looking for, but I admit that watching the movie gives you the same disturbed feeling."
5,Insanity at its most entertaining!,"Inspired by the true crimes of mass murderer Ed Gein, Robert Block created a horror classic when he gave voice to Norman Bates and his beloved ""mother"". He managed to make the Bates character both sympathetic and sinister....the Hitchcock movie is an A plus, but lets not forget where the screenplay came from and give Bloch his due. This is a great, great book!"
4,Pretty good. Just like the movie,I really enjoyed the book Psycho! It was highly shockin and the ending was awesome. I would recommend this book to kids 12+ but it was a good read!
4,"Powerful, harrowing novel","I have been reading this book and have only a little more than 23 pages to the end. However, so far, I have been bowled over by the strong use of language and the way themes and concepts are introduced! This is one book that I think could (and possibly should) be assigned to read in junior high or high school. That's how moved I am by it. The human condition is one of the central threads of the tlae and you and I being human can certainly relate to that if I'm not mistaken."
3,Good Book,It's a really good book. It's vague and broad so it leaves more for you to fill in with your imagination. The cover of the book looks nothing like the picture which is what really upset me.
2,Mediocre at best,"This CD is OK for someone never exposed to really bone-crushing riff-ridden rock. It has some pretty good songs but overall they are not going to be popular much longer. Their five minutes has came and went with ""Whatever""."
1,This would have been good 10 years ago!!,"This is definitely a flash back to the early 90's grunge era. Very unoriginal. As a matter of fact, this is a total rip-off from STP's Core album back from 1992, except not even close to the quality that Core offers. This vocalist even tries to sound like Weiland. In any case, don't buy this over-rated and unoriginal garbage. For all you teeny-boppers out there who just got into this style of music, check out the old stuff like STP, Alice n Chains, and Nirvana. By the way, if you're looking for a true alternative/metal sound and if your ears are worthy enough, check out TOOL's Aenima album, easily the best album of the 90's and light years ahead of this junk."
2,God[stink],"The first time I heard this I thought Alice in Chains had finally come out with a new cd, and I was disappointed. Instead I discovered the ""hot new band"" everyone was clamoring about. From the name ""Godsmack"" to their vocals, hell their overall sound it reeks of ALICE IN CHAINS RIPOFF...the vocalist only wishes he could sing HALF as well as the recently departed Layne Staley of AIC. Hell I bet Laynes voice is still better than whoever the fronman for Godwak pretends to be. I only give this CD 2 stars to contrast their even worse second cd, which I will give one star."
1,evil,"to many bad words (except for this version) to evil, and never slap jesus. hes the man. And I hate voodoo. its evil man! I laugh at the album cause its so rediculous. I do give them credit because they sound AWESOME but like, have bad toppics. not recommended for any religious ppl."
4,I guess they are pretty good =),"Hmm, I didn't really buy the Cd, but I downloaded all the songs on my computer. You see the reason I downloaded the songs was because my crush really liked them and i figure it would be cool to have it too. But then I found out that they were REALLY cool and the songs kind of grow on you after a while. Pretty awesome. SO now you can say that i really like Godsmack."
5,Hardcore...better than ever!!!!!,"This CD is probably one of the best I've ever gotten. It's hard with grinding guitars and a great lead singer. Every song on this CD, every song, is badass. I really don't have a favorite because all of them are explosive enough to be hits. If there is a band to raise hardcore/metal to a higher level, its Godsmack!!!!!!"
2,"90's corporate rock - nothing alternative, or indie here","These guys are Alice In Chains rip offs, they even named themselves after one of Alice in Chain's worst songs. This album is very repitive and most of the songs sound the same and are very bland and boring. If you like any of their songs then pick up Alice In Chains Dirt, the best grunge album of the 90's. When alternative becomes mainstream, then the underground is the only alternative left. Recommended for those who think that MTV's Return of the Rock is good for rock music."
5,I GOT SMACKED!!!!,GODSMACK rocks I absolutly love this cd. I got the cd after hearing them on the radio and im glad i did. I ran out and got their 2nd which rocks also!! Get this cd the words are great and the music is kicking definetly let some aggression out and unwind with this one you won't be dissapointed. I can't wait to see them live I hope their as good. August there coming. Go get the cd it is EXCELLENT!!!!!!
5,Get Away,"This cd is the perfect heavy metal cd. I love the lead singers voice, its so angry and demanding. This is an almost perfect recording, the lyrics are related, but hey, the album is still awesome. I can without-a-doubt say that every song is good, I can listen to this cd 5 times through and never get bored of it. ""Someone in London"" is an amazing instrumental, which might get nominated for a Grammy if they use it as their next single. This cd will get you pumped up and angry for no reason, but I guarentee you will enjoy it. I would have to say that this is my favorite cd at the moment, and although my music preferences do change, I can honestly say this cd will make you happy."
4,A must for metal fans,"Godsmack broke onto the music scene with little to no airplay. Their fans saw the music the way the band wanted them to, and they became extremely popular. Their self-titled cd is amazing, it mixes the best of old rock, with the best of new metal. The band's lead singer (sully) has an amazing voice that really gets you into the music. Godsmack has definately shown that they have the staying power in today's hostile music buisness. This cd is a must for anyone who is a fan of Hard Rock/Metal."
3,The Word Is Derivative,"These guys REALLY wish they were Nine Inch Nails. OK for pop Industrial fanatics, all others need not apply."
4,You're all direlects.,"Ridiculous reviews flooding poor amazons bandwidth. Godsmack started out as an AIC cover band, that stated, you can all stop acting like you're too cool for Godsmack because you're stuck dry-humping Nirvana and STP's leg. The album is catchy, well written, and sounds blue-collar. The album was produced with very little money but came out sounding as good as any high budget recording session. The songs are very pacing, melodic, heavy, and apathetic. It's a great CD and if you're mad at someone or feel alienated, the lyrics could be quite soothing to you. Don't put down other music just to seem like you are just too cool to lower yourself to listen to this. They have some similarities with AIC but not enough to matter because this album's one of my favorites of all rock bands and AIC sucks perineum."
4,the best cd by godsmack,i think this has to be there best album it has nice tunes such as whatever and stay away and voodoo and time bomb a definetly a must this cd is great and i really enjoy it.
3,Good but I feel they will do better in the future,Do not get me wrong this is a good album. I just feel that the band needs time to grow. This album is a taste of things to come. I feel they will create much better music in the future. They seem to be one of the most promiseing bands I have heard in a long long time. They have a great sound. They just need time to exspand musically.
1,Waste of money,"These discs allow to be written at 16x only despite the claim of 16x to 24x ""ultra speed"". The CD writting software identified the manufacturer as INFODISK.I purchased the disc pack to make VCDs. The discs proved unreliable for VideoCD. VCDs did not play on the same CD-RW drive (under WinXP), or in my consumer DVD player (where other brands work.) The VCDs played on Mac OSX using DLC (freeware VCD player) but the video was choppy and the player became unstable.I am forced to give this Memorex product one star because zero is not an option."
4,Informative,"No doubt if you have suffered a miscarriage, you scoured the net for information and answers. Preventing Miscarriage does repeat alot of what can be found on the net but also offers other interesting information and statistics. I certainly found this book a help when looking for answers."
4,Informative and upbeat reading,"After suffering 2 pregnancy losses in the last 6 months, I found this book to be informative and provides insight to many questions I will certainly ask my doctor next time. The stories reveal the pain many women go throught to achieve a normal pregnancy. My only reason for not giving this 5 stars is that it is an older book."
4,THE OVERLOOKED ROCK-SOUL BAND,"I SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF MY JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL TIME LISTENING TO REDBONE. I WAS VERY HAPPY FOR THEM THAT THEY SCORED A BIG HIT WITH COME AND GET YOUR LOVE. BUT FOR THE UNINITIATED, THIS IS A GENEROUS OFFERING OF THE GROUP, FILLED WITH CLASSIC SONGS FROM MESSAGE FROM A DRUM AND WOVOKA. THIS BAND HAD SO MUCH SOUL AND TALENT, IT'S A SHAME THEY DIDN'T GET MORE RECOGNITION THAT THEY GOT. THE LEAD SINGER...LOLLY VEGAS, SOUNDS A LOT LIKE MARVIN GAYE. ROCK ON, REDBONE!"
1,Daisy Miller,I bought this book because I had to write 4 book reports for English and this was a short book!I actually like classics but found this boring and not in the least bit interesting!If I hadnt got to write about it for my report i wouldnt have bothered reading it all which is unusual for me. Maybe its just me but this was one book I would nevr recommend!
4,"Henry James' ""Daisy Miller""","Brief, but with a great deal of substance. Daisy is a fascinating character. Like Winterborne, I spent most of the story unsure of her motivations only to realize she had none. She wasn't playing some intricate societal game or trying to create controversy, she just wanted to have fun in a society that denigrated women for defining ""fun"" in the carefree way of Daisy. It's a simple, beautiful, and all together tragic story of an innocent young woman who wished only to do as she pleased, hurting no one except, ultimately, herself."
4,great short read,i'm a huge fan of Henry James and this novel is one of my favorites. it's a short easy read - great for a weekend trip.
3,A reader that picked a good book for a book report,"I thought Daisy Miller was a great book. It really makes you think about our society today. A lot of people think that other countries customs are strict and abnormal but just think about what they might be saying about our society today...teenagers do drugs at wild parties and get drunked, teenage girls as young as 13 have babies. Daisy was originaly from America, and grew up on America's customs. So when she went to Europe she was considered a low-class, social outcast and her behavior eventually lead to her death."
4,slow but fascinating,"Modern readers might be put off by the lack of action in this short novel, but Daisy Miller is a psychological study. Daisy Miller, a young American girl, cannot navigate the social complexities of Americans in Europe. In fact, she does not even try. Daisy is her own person, with her own mind. She is a liberated woman before the phrase was ever invented. The young American man who falls in love with her fails to express his feelings because he is too concerned with what others think of her. The tale is a tragedy, with a suitably sad ending."
5,Died and gone to Rambutan Heaven!,"My neighbor just gifted me with two packages of these wonderful fruits! I have never tried Rambutans before, and now wonder what other amazing fruits I have missed out on! They are so easy to open and pop the little fruit out. I just stick the whole thing in my mouth and gently nibble on the fruit until I reach the seed. The taste is very similar to fresh coconut meat only less conconut-ie and slightly acidic. The texture is sort of wet/slimy- only less slimy and only more damp then wet. The seed is about the size and color of an almond. Apparently they can be so what poisonous is eaten, but can be cooked and eaten. These would be wonderful to take on a road trip or on a picnic. The taste is sweet and mild so young children might enjoy them- just MAKE SURE you cut the meat off so they don't choke on the seed.Bon Appetit!"
3,great fruit!,"came in the mail over night.. the fruit was still very fresh. the wife enjoyed them very much so. she was surprised to see them after not eating them for 8 years. but it is kinda pricy to order, the only down fall."
5,OEM Replacement - Great,"I can confirm that my recent purchase arrived as a pair, are from MTD and are designed, as stated on the package, for ""Two-Stage Models 1992 and After"" such as Troy-Bilt, MTD, Yard Machines, Gold, Bolens, White, Huskee, and Yard-Man. A great deal, and made in the USA."
4,Another Awesome Set By Jay J!,"A wonderful deep house set complied by Jay J. In particular, I love ""KEEP HOPING"" by BEARD FT AMMA. If you like also check out the other great tracks offered by Inspirit Music label.**** and two thumbs up!"
1,SHADOWS AND FIBS....,"After reading The Shadow of the Panther I realized that it was simplifying and demonizing Huey P. Newton and the Black Panther Party. The information gathered is conflicting and at best contradicting. This may be due to Hugh Pearson's questionable ""inside"" sources. More critically reliable reading on the Black Panther Party and Huey P. Newton can be found in Panther on the Prowl by Elbert ""Bigman"" Howard and We Want Freedom: a Life in the Black Panther Party by Mumia Abu-Jamal.Both these titles are thoroughly concise and supported by personal experience and all former Party members."
4,very interesting book,this book tells many different sides of the panthers good&bad.but even though the way it is written may sway you one way or the other the panthers were very important to the world at large.i do feel that Huey Newton could have been a real bigger force if headed that way.the minds of the Men&women in the Panther party are incredible.many of them have gone on to contribute alot to this country.but if done right they would have been a political party unto themselves.with all the party's getting in to politics this would have been a true challenge.i see the bigger picture of what might have been.this book leaves room for many different thoughts.
2,As reliable as the history book you read in high school,"I am not a supporter of the Black Panthers, in fact I oppose them. Hugh Pearson does more than promote the Panthers in his hollow tell-all book by showing the public how lied about the Panthers are. Much of his sources are misinterpreted, as others have said, and he often seeks the worst outlook as a way of conveying the situation, never giving to even a modest viewpoint. He takes several sources that can be interpreted as unreliable, and then makes it worse by distorting the information therein. His book is as reliable as the history book you used in high school. It has so little of a reliable basis that one should only use it with the utmost scrutiny."
3,Noisy,"I bought this to use on fishing trips, and set it up at home to try it out. It is WAY too noisy to use camping, fishing, or boating. Also, the machine smells like burning motor parts and plastic (we followed the cleaning instructions, and the vinegar smell wasn't as bad as the machine smell itself). I gave it 3 stars because it is average.... Makes ice, which is what I wanted, but if it had been quieter and less smelly, I would have rated it higher.Amazon shipping with my membership was exemplary."
4,Great ice maker,Nice looking ice maker machine...have had it for some weeks now and works great...unit is a little bigger than what I expected but other than that has been a great purchase!
1,Do not buy,purchased this for use on my boat. NEVER MADE IT THERE. i set it up and went through a cleaning cycle. it never made for than 2 batches of ice with out having to be reset. Piece of junk. returned it and bought one local at target for 100.00 less and it works fine.
3,Arrived Broken,"I really think Glinda is adorable! Unfortunately, one of the points on her crown was laying in the bottom of the box. Thankfully, I had a tube of crazy glue & I fixed her myself!"
3,Good and Not so good...,"This was NOT very easy to install, and I can do anything ! Plus, IT WHISTLES and HUMS when flying down the highway !!! My van USED TO BE QUIET, not anymore !! It IS MUCH BETTER than what Chrysler gives you on a Town and Country though !"
4,Brinke Stevens' Best,"I love Brinke Stevens, and I think this is her finest film. If you're looking for a serious horror film, don't bother with this DVD. If you want to see an original, quirky, amusing, and fun B movie, this is a great choice. If nothing else, you'll be humming the infectious theme song in your head for weeks."
2,boring,If you have nothing to read it may be okay.But otherwise no.All they do is orginize a yard sale.There is no plot.It is a waste of time.
5,Best lefty,"This is by far the best left-handed holster I have used. The thick padding of the holster keeps the drill securly in place even without the strap. The bit pockets are very handy for pencils(or even screws) as well as bits. Bucket Boss somehow made this durable, comfortable, holster better and cheaper than any other holster I've seen."
3,"For anyone else, so-so; for Altman, bad","I saw this movie when it came out, and stayed in the theater to see it over again in the hope of understanding at least what was going on. After all, it was Altman, for whom straightforward movies like M*A*S*H are a rarity. But, nada. Bud Cort is an appealing guy who deserved a better career, and he'll be remembered for Harold and Maude, but this one was a mistake. Maybe if the soundtrack had been by Cat Stevens. . ."
5,Excellent Remake of the Old Classic,"Pearl Jam does an excellent remake of J. Frank Wilson and the Cavalier's 1964 hit ""Last Kiss"". If you are a fan of oldies, you will love this song. The guy who said this song is boring (Peter, From Australia) obviously doesn't appreciate good music. I never get tired of this song. I can play it over and over. Get this CD single, it is a MUST HAVE."
2,Stupid song,"This is a dumb song from the past that someone decided to remake. I mean seriously, it is a sad theme but a bad song by a bad band. That's all there is to it!"
3,"Sweet, but not Pearl Jam","I loved this pretty little ""tragic lost love"" ballad remake when I first heard it, but I have to admit that I was a little sadened by its existence. Understand, if you are a fan of Pearl Jam (as I do consider myself to be)you can't help but feel that this song signals the creative death of what was once a great band that once helped build, along with Nirvana, a new sound in music. Eddie and Co., please don't let ""Last Kiss"" be your lasting impression."
5,"This CD single contains the best song, Last Kiss","Last Kiss, one of the most popular songs this summer has been released on this CD. It is a good song"
5,Its so amazing!,"I really don't like Pearl Jam but when I heard this song , I went out and brought the single. I love them."
3,Suffers from ground loop noise interference,"The device does its job, but it suffers from ground loop noise interference between the stereo system and the headphone switch.... which is probably why the device is so cheapIf you don't already have a ground loop isolator, then you're going to end up buying one....."
5,Very Pleased,"I was looking for a simple switch to use between my PC speakers and my headset. This turned out to be more than I expected. What's really nice is that it essentially extended the speaker and microphone jacks out to where I can conveniently connect to them. Prior to getting the switch I had to get on my hands and knees and plug into the back of my PC. Now the switch sits on the top of my desk. I'm no audio expert, but the throughput is static free and sounds good to me. I'm very happy with this purchase."
5,Outstanding product and price.,"When it comes to function and value,I don't think I have ever found any product as good as this one.Case closed."
5,Great Item,I got this today and I love it! It's perfect for what I need - to switch between my headset for Skype (and other voice-chats) and my computer speakers. I don't detect any noise or hiss. Works exactly as it should. And it's a GREAT DEAL.
2,Disappointing,"There are a lot of things good about this book including interesting characters and an okay plot even if it is a little formulaic (noble born child kidnapped into slavery so he doesn't know who he is). Ms. Marston does have skill as a writer, particularly in description. However, this book is BADLY in need of an editor. Redundancy, sometimes in back to back sentences was particularly annoying. The characters lapse in and out of their accents more than Kevin Costner did in his infamous ""Robin Hood."" There are pages and pages of build up but then the climatic scenes are over in a few paragraphs. Nothing a good rewrite wouldn't fix. Perhaps the publisher had a deadline. At any rate, I'm not going to take a chance on the rest of the trilogy."
2,Pleasant but not great and a little cliched,"This book is sort of the paperback version of the hit TV show ""The Highlander"" in that the main characters are sword swinging celts saying ""Aye, wee lassie"" and ""I dinna know."" The book is narrated in first person, and perhaps that accounts for why most of the characters are so flat. There isn't much world building and description either. The one female character fights, of course, all the time with the man, of course, whom she will marry. Along the way she threatens to ""box his ears"" and her ""lips drew a thin line,"" and all the other cliches of characterization. The book is not bad but don't expect something along the lines of McFarland or Jordan. I'd suggest buying just this first one and only then deciding on whether to get the other two."
4,not a war story but rather a love story,"If Mr. Mauritz was British, we would refer to him as Sir Micheal as he should be Knighted for his heart rendering real life recollection of youth in the turbulant winter and spring of 1944. The message here is that as people we take care of our own. As nationalists and political beings and even soldiers we are limited in scope and confused by conflicting priorities. This read is actually a magical backporch story of wisdom, honor, and the stongest emotion that we can collectively embrace our human condition with, love. Loyalty, family, endurance, luck, and God's wonderfull grace are all wonderfully celabrated in this actioned packed adventure."
1,Would like to give this movie 0 stars...,"This movie fails to deliver on *every* level. The fighting is lame (I can't even remember it). The sex is lame (can't remember this either). Even the dialogue isn't cheesy enough to be funny. About the only thing good about this film was the opening credits that show ""Superchick"" walking through an airport with her 70's style blonde hair and all the men turning to watch her - reminds me of a shampoo commercial. And the only thing that bounces as she walks through the airport is her hair... Not bad enough to be funny."
2,What A Joke,This bag looks like a winner but the one I got lasted only two months the handle and sholder strap are held on the top of the front flap by some thread that is sewn in a large rivet an staples the hole conection point is less than 2 inches. Two weeks ago while walking in Boston to a service call the shoulder strap let go when the bag hit the concret the sound told me it all. My laptop screen was toast as well as the hard drive which now won't start up.If you buy this make sure the load is lightand check the handle often.
3,Fools Gold,"I thought by the shorts it was going to be gripping. It was slow in some areas, and a bit predictable, but all in all it was light and enjoyable"
1,Foolish.,"Fool's Gold starring Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey was a complete letdown from start to finish. If you want red hot chemistry, well you aren't going to find it here! Hudson and McConaughey are attractive in their own right, but the chemistry they had in How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is nowhere to be found in Fool's Gold. You can see the ending a mile away and this film is just too long and pointless. Even Donald Sutherland looks bored and out of place here! This action/adventure rom-com is anything but gold!"
2,FOOL'S GOLD,MOVIE IS NOT ALL ON ONE SIDE OF DISCHAVE TO TURN OVER IN MIDDLE OF MOVIETHE MOVIE IS GREAT BUT I AM DISAPPOINTED IN DISC
2,moovluvr,"unfortunetely i was surprised that i liked this movie less than i expected, even though i wasn't expecting a lot to begin with. there were a couple of negative reviews that said it all. the positive reviewer must have just had a great dinner and a lot of chocolate or something. if you have a need to see clear blue water, just rent it. don't buy. bad chemistry, only fair acting, too long, etc etc etc. the best part about it was the rabbit thing. i love rabbits"
3,Fool's Gold,"A couple discovers a lucrative treasure, making them the toast of the town and landing them on the cover of National Geographic. Years later, a second attempt to find another treasure has left their marriage shipwrecked and has plunged them into debt. Fools Gold which stars Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson is a decent movie. This movie has some action, humor and excitment. Overall a decent movie."
1,Very disappointing,"The cast was good, the topic (hunt for sunken treasure) is always fun, how bad can it be? Well, rent this out and find out for yourselves. Extremely cliche, *very* bad acting, zero chemistry between the cast, one big disappointment."
2,Not a romantic comedy,"I chose this movie because I like the lead actor & actress and had just watched another movie where I felt they had great chemistry. While the chemistry and acting were fine in this one, I didn't enjoy the story line. I was looking for a romantic comedy not a violent action movie."
3,It was a gift,It was a gift from me to my daughter-in law. She like it very much!! She loves movies on blu-ray.
2,Ridiculous but a fine escape,"Let me explain both parts of the title of my review: I thought this book was ridiculous--the tale is crafted as a journal. In the journal Patricia, our heroine, makes sweeping generalizations about Brits, Irish, and Americans, and then goes on and on about the individualism of the woman in the Vermeer painting. Whew, this art historian needs to work on removing her head from the sand. I got quite riled up about the ending, too, (which I promise not to reveal). It's a bit of a trick that is in contradiction to the form of the novella--a confessional journal. I was surprised to see no hints of the ending until the last page.However, that scathing review aside, I have to admit I did get riled up. And I like when a book riles me up. So, that's a plus."
3,A very fine writer but a book that doesn't hold up.,"The combination of truth and fiction does not hold up in this book. This is really about a woman who has had a terrible loss and how she grasps at love only to be disappointed. It is played against a background of a splinter group of Irish terrorists who are bent on stealing a famous painting and holding it for ransom. She misses out on a plot that could have been wonderful - the taking of the painting from the British Royals - and dwells on things that are only minimally interesting. She should also have researched the Frick Collection where they do not use slides and where lunch is not a stiff, formal affair."
5,Excellent,"This book is one of my favorites of all time. Contrary to the previous review, I thoroughly prefer the the Old English version and do not find it a chore to read at all, howerever this is a matter of personal taste."
1,Racist. Not recommended.,"I bought this to give to my niece for Christmas but it contains several highly racist bits as the boy travels to different countries to collect animals for his zoo. He goes to Asia where he meets ""helpers who all wear their eyes at a slant"" (accompanied by WWII propoganda-style caricatures of Asians). When he goes to Africa the animal he captures is held aloft by two tribal Africans illustrated in the typical minstrel show/early 20th century racist exaggerated style. And he goes to Russia to collect a bird ""whose headski is redski and belly is blueski.""Yes, the book was originally printed in 1950 and maybe it was a less enlightened time and my niece is going to encounter society's racial stereotypes soon enough. But I'm not going to be the one to introduce them to her."
3,Best Book Ever,"I am currently in high school. Since I was 2 years old I have been enjoying this classic story. It liberates the imagination, and gives all people of all ages the permission to think creatively and accomplish something important. I have lived by this book since I was young. I will always enjoy it because it is an inspiration to any reader who associates with Gerald McGrew. ""And some how or other I think I could find some beasts of a much more unusual kind."""
5,What can I say?,"What can I say? This is by Dr. Seuss, the best children's book author of all time. 'Nuff said."
3,ok for some things,Not for use with small drills or impact guns...not for use with drill bits (will stab your self guys think about it...lol) but good for general use drill like say 18v dewalt or such...just remember no drill bits...darn that smarts...lol
5,The VB.Net Bible!!!,"This book is simply perfect. We call it ""The Bible"" and it proved time and again to deserve that name. After spending a lot of money on useless ASP.net books, I finally got this book and things cleared up as magic. Although it's a huge book, you will have to work a lot to find any wrong code, or even a typo. Great writing, great revision, great edition.One advice though: if you never programmed before, you should try a beginner's book instead (check out ""Beginning VB.Net"" by Wrox), since this one won't spend pages explaining what's an object or an event. And the backcover is misleading indeed, although you get ""an"" eBook (Balena's VB6 book), it's not this edition's eBook. ..."
5,Great movie,"I just saw this movie on television recently. I'm convinced Vanessa Redgrave will be just as strong and commanding when she's 90. She was incredible in this part. I agreed with another reviewer that the best scenes were between her and the boy, and the other characters just left you feeling a little annoyed (except for the uncle--he was funny). The stepmother was just a little ""too concerned"" to be believable. And what father loses his wife, get re-married & then stays gone 98% of the time? The ending also kind of sucked. I didn't care about the ""communication from beyond""--I just wanted them to go on & keep being friends."
4,Take a friend and a box of kleenex!,"If you have lost a loved one, this movie will give you a chance to grieve further, and end up with hope. Very touching.It was visually beautiful. And Vanessa Redgrave was worth the price of the ticket. For those women in the ""invisible years"" she is an inspiration (tho I never cared for her politics.)"
2,Not Pro Quality,"I thought I would get a tough, pro-quality belt at a bargain rate. Not quite. Right away, the buckle won't hold it's adjustment. I'm constantly struggling with it. The pockets are not holding their shape after 16 months of full time use. My 12V cordless sags in the holster, etc. I don't like how it feels much in general, too saggy. It does the job however and is certainly the best availible for the price. Recommended for ocasional use."
2,Stuckee,"I needed more pockets and nooks for all the tools in use on my multi year home remodeling project. That is all this bag has going for it. I took the belt off the first day replacing it with a better one I had on hand. I did use the belt the other week with electrical bags on, what a pain. The bags pull into a bunch in the middle on the belt and puff out excessively to the sides. Some stiffing material along the belt sleeve would help this. It seems to me that too many of the pockets went to speed squares but not one for a carpenters square. I could use more places to store tools and only a couple speed square pockets. There are a few pockets I will miss when I can afford to replace from this belt. The little pocket with the flap is great for drill bits and drivers and the big bulging pockets can hold a two or three gang box etc., the three nail pockets are handy and the tape pocket works well for tapes or a forth nail bag if needed.Keep looking would be my advice."
3,"Enjoyable, not overly essential or exciting","It is great to see an obscure band like this get a full CD release to explore their material. I enjoy Fifth Dimension, Cornelius Bros., Friends Of Distinction and while this has a very similar sound there is something lacking. The male vocals are a bit too on the gospel baritone side for my liking, while the female vocals are smooth & light, tackling some cover tunes. None of the material is really ear-catching though, thus resulting in only two minor charting songs. My heading sums it up really. Enjoyable, nice performance, but the material is just not up to par with the other groups mentioned, and unless you are a hardcore smooth R&B collector, this is not an overly essential or exciting buy."
4,Works fine on XP and does what it says,"This works just fine on XP, regardless of what other reviewers have said. Installation isn't easy, but there are steps at the Targus website that'll get you through it.It syncs quickly and easily, no surprises. Just plug the cable in, press the Sync button on your Palm, or on the cable, and away it goes. Also does a fine job of charging your Palm on the go.Allows you to keep your palm charged on the go without a need for a travel-charger, and multiple plug converters for international plug outlets, MAJOR PLUS. (Obviously you need to have a laptop for this).Also, if you've got a notebook computer that - for whatever reason - doesn't have an IR port, and you actually move around with your computer (i.e. can't lug a cradle everywhere), this device is probably something you desperately need."
3,CDOLEN,"Loved the book, but I do have a prejudice: RW Haltom is my great-great grandfather. Can't say I was particularly proud of some of his positions, but then it was a different time. I can say that I was amazed that in 1902 the culture was still so shoot-em-up. I didn't realize that gun play was still such a part of the era. I thought the author did an excellent job of setting the stage for what led up to the hanging, and also of explaining the politics which were the backdrop of so much of the story. Overall, it was a quick read and very informative as well as entertaining. Great Texas history here!"
4,Great,I loved the arrowhead. The only problem is I need a bigger chain. It is for my husband for our 25th anniversary. I am still looking though. Thanks a lot.
5,First Review,"Well if you're visitin this page i am gessin that you know a thing or two about SOTT,don't buy this Item unless you've purchesed Peach-Giving birth to a stone,that was their first ulbam,anyways I don't want to compare this guys to Tool but they have that toolish feeling to them especially the bass player,this is in my opinion one of the best act to come from england even though they have been inactive for awhile...."
5,An allegorical tale,"Maybe I got it wrong, but I saw the story as an allegory about modern Iran - represented by the little girl who wanted to keep in touch with this tradition of having a new goldfish for nouruz. The people that she met on her journey I saw as representing aspects of government, or philosophies of government. The soldier could represent the military option that some countries adopt, the Sufi could stand for some charismatic knid of Islam, etc.I understood the film to be an exposition, to the established order in Iran and to the world, that Iranians must find their own way to decide who they are now, in the 21st century. Not a puppet state to the US, nor a revolutionary Islamic state. Something better, I hope.Regrettably, such observations must be made as obtuse as possible, so no-one has to go to prison for criticising the powers that be.Or maybe I got it all wrong. Maybe it's just a boring story about a spoiled little girl."
3,Harry Potter fun,"I purchased two of these for my three year old twin boys. I found that the glasses were a bit too tight for both of their heads and as a result they did not want to wear them. Eventually one of the pair snapped. They are really adorable, and my kids are a little rough on their things, so maybe they will work out for someone else.Mia B"
3,ok,could be better it is a cookbook chocked full of recipes--easy to follow- remember to measure everything you try to cook
5,COOKBOOK,"A great cook!I give it :Meep meep meep meep meep, five Stars. Love it! Definetly good noms! I recommend this book to All chefs!"
2,Don't bother with the low-end Kindle,"The low-end Kindle cannot handle anything other than straight type. And these particular versions are usually a mess, so don't bother."
3,I t's ok,"Not for the novice or beginner cook, and I found lots of things in the recipes that are not pantry staples in my house. Yet if you are looking for traditional Italian cuisene you have found the right offering."
3,Not Quite What I Was Expecting,I should have known but I wasn't expecting the old-fashioned style & commentary. Most of the recipes aren't ones I'd use without substantial updating for a more modern palate. But if you're into traditional recipes it might be for you.
1,Discontinued and no support,"I picked up the Jessum Rout R Slide Sliding router table used and am not happy at all. Given ""buyer beware"" I would have thought Jessum would provide SOME support in the way of accessories AND an instruction manual. My perception of Jessum is innovative and quality, except with regard to this table. Avoid it on the used market."
4,A beautiful addition to your coffee table,"I got this book to get in touch with my sexual side a little more and I'm glad I grabbed this book. I can't say I am blown away by every poem in this book. Some were good, some were meh and some really knocked the wind out of me at how deep, passionate and creative it is. I really love keeping it in my room and grab it whenever I feel like I want to get moved. I tabbed the ones that really shook me to the core so that I may revisit them and so I can share with others. If you like poetry and have nothing to hide about your sexuality, then this book is a gem. Get it!"
5,Best book about Africa I have read,"The difficulty with books about Africa is that, for the most part, they do not say anything of substance, or give insight into the inner life of Africans. Professor Diawara's book was an extraordinary find for me. It reveals the inner life of Africans from the perspective of a American of West African birth: how Africans live and feel, the contradictions and difficulties transitioning from tribalism to colonialism to independence tainted by dependence on the West. It also is extraordinary in that it includes the perspective of African Americans, both viewed by Africans and viewed by Europeans. His perspectives on African and African-American music and films gives insight into the underlying cultural issues of both groups. Essential reading for those looking for a real understanding."
4,Three years and still going. . . .,"I have owned this bag for over 3 years. It is way overloaded (so much that I don't even worry about zipping it up), and has held up very well. Only two small problems (due to my overloading): the clips that hold the stap to the rings on the bag broke, and the metal bar that holds the shape of the main opening has come out of the end seam. This bag does hold a lot of ""stuff."" It has held up very well despite my abusing and overloading (it weighs about 80 lbs with all my stuff.) Well worth the buy!"
3,Not worth it...,Too expensive! I don't have it and won't get it until it gets cheaper. Don't even know whats in it and it's $35 just for a DEMO DISC! Forget this junk if it isn't lower than $10...Probably doesn't even have anything good in it.
1,Horrible,"Shaun Brumder (Colin Hanks) is a surfer from Orange County who dreams of going to Stanford University to become a writer.Unfortunately, his moronic guidance counsellor sends in the wrong transcript and he is rejected from Stanford.Shaun goes to great lengths with a little help from his girlfriend Ashley and his burnout, loser brother Lance (Jack Black) to get into Stanford any way they see fit.This has to be one of the worst movies I have seen. It's terrible."
2,Dissappointing,"I was hoping this would be better than it was. I thought thiswas a disappointment overall. Jack Black's character was one of the reasons that this movie was less than it could have been. The stereotypical party animal is something that I've seen time and time again, and don't need to see again unless they add some kind of spice to it.Another general problem with this movie is that the jokes weren't funny. They tried to push the laugh so many times in this movie and I felt myself chuckle a little, but only because I was trying to laugh.What I did like about this movie was the whole idea of trying to escape one's surroundings to become a writer. You kind of find yourself pulling for Colin Hank's character to make it. The problem is that some of the means that are taken to get into Stanford are idoitic.The character development has something to be desired. This was an effort to be a ""smart"" comedy (I think), but it wasn't."
2,Dissappointing,"I gotta say as with most movies, this movie's previews dipicted all of the funny parts, other then that it's not really worth watching unless you get to do so for free! Don't expect too much, basically it's just a film that tries to make the stereotypical california kids the butt of this hour and a half long joke!"
3,"Dumb, But Funny","It's a no-brainer. That's it. You sit their with your date, laugh, say, oh, my God and that's all. Some of it was outrageous. Kind of animal house. But all it all, it was fun"
3,Dumb is Good...And Very Entertaining,"Colin Hanks, son of Tom, plays a suburban teenager from Orange County, who applies to Stanford University in the hopes of studying with his idol (a very tweedy Kevin Kline) and becoming the next great American novelist.The movie, directed by Jake Kasdan, leans heavily on the pot-head humor found in ""Animal House,"" ""Road Trip"" and at least 110 other movies. But that's ok. Laughs are plentiful. The film never bores. And it is chock full of sight gags, great comebacks and inspired farce. I had so much fun, I even hit the rewind button to playback some of the film's wackier moments. You'll probably do the same."
5,AWESOME,I LOVE Jack Black and this was the first movie that I ever saw with him. It arrived in like new condition and I played it the same day that I received it. It's hilarious..
5,tHiS ThE BeSt MoViE EvEr!!!,"Orange County is my FAVORITE movie ever!!! It is really really funny!!!Everyone should watch Orange County!!! Shaun is trying to get into stanford but his transcript got changed and the whole movie he is trying to get into to stanford with the ""help"" from his brother lance( who during the movie is constantly in his underware). This is a great movie but as the rating says shouldn't be watched by anyone under the age or 13. It is a little on the innapropriat side."
3,Orange County,"Ok, Well the first time I watched this movie it was about 1:00 a.m. and at that time of the morning alot of things are funny that normal people don't think are funny. However the second time I watched it I was a little more coherent and didn't think it was quite so comical. I would recommend that if you want a good comedy then watch this early in the morning and you will fell like you got your moneys worth. It is definately worth watching at least once."
3,Good movie,"Orange County was good. Jack Black was definately the funniest character in the movie. My only complaint is that it felt short, and it left me wanting more. As an overall movie though it's definately above average and entertaining throughout. Worth a rental at the least."
4,Pretty good,"Jack Black of Tenacious D. makes this one worth it with just his comedy alone. Although he isn't the main actor, he still performs extremely well with his high and stupid role. One of the funniest parts is where Ben Stiller (as a firefighter) queries Jack Black as to how the fire in the admissions building got started. That entire segment of the movie from breaking into the building for the...what's that thing called...DIRECTORY...to the part where Jack and Colin go pick up Colin's girlfriend is freakin' hilarious!! All in all, the plot is good and the acting is alright. Check it out, even though it isn't nearly as good as 'Saving Silverman.'"
5,Woodland Tales,"Wonderful Classic Book!! I have this book so that I can share it with my grandchildren,as it has really nice tales,about the animals that live it the woods."
2,I dunno....,"I have tried three of the sweet style breads, trying to make something my kids would like. The have all looked good, they rise nicely and have good texture, but they are quite boring tasting and no one actually LIKED them especially my picky kids. To be fair, I haven't yet tried the basic wheat bread/oat bread loaves... but those recipes are everywhere and I was looking for something different. I sure hate it when bread is no good. What a waste of time and ingredients!"
5,Great!,"What a wonderful way to honor the 7-time Tour de France champ. The photography is awesome, and the book does a great job of capturing images of Lance at every stage throughout his amazing journey, both in the Tour and in life. Much more then just your average coffee table book!"
4,A good read..but you must decide what is real and what isn't,The commodity trading profession has very few books written about it. This is one of the better books but you must decipher what the truth is and what is fictitious. Copetas speculates alot about the life of Marc Rich and takes alot of pot shots at his career. Truth is Copetas is an outsider and outsiders can not accurately report about covert and clandestine physical commodity trades. I should know....I worked for the best metal man in the world.
4,Great Read,A great book if you are interested in sustainable energy technologies and the ways the affect our world.
4,Worh the money.,"I have recently ordered my fourth BucketBoss in five years and recommend it. Three of the others were well-worn but I passed them down to family members for home use. As a maintenance tech I require good quality and workmanship and find both with this product. The only drawback to me is the lack of depth in the upper pockets on the inside. My 12"" Cresent wrench and 12"" adjustable pliers extend too far above the bucket rim."
3,"Good, but Tipsy","As other reviewers have said, it is rugged and has more pockets than you will need. However, for five stars, it would need to have more-flexible pockets (trying to cram something into some of the small pockets can be ridiculous) and created be such that the center of balance is lower on the bucket. Unless you keep something heavy in bottom of the bucket, the bucket is quite easy to tip over unless you are careful enough to balance the tools around the bucket, which I am not.I got my Bucket Boss stolen full of tools as a ""Welcome Home From 2 Years in the Peace Corps"" gift, and am now trying to replace everything. Got my dad the Bucket Boss Gatemouth bag four years ago and he loves it. Going to go that route myself instead of another bucket."
5,My husband absolutely loves this!!,"As soon as I gave this to my husband (who is a brilliant do-it-yourselfer - he immediately filled it and it is the only thing I see around the house and outdoors all the time. It is extremely convenient. A friend of his was helping to build a new deck and as a present, I gave him one because he kept admiring my husband's. This is an absolutely fabulous gift for the kids to give Dad on Father's Day. It's very inexpensive, but it is made extremely well. Just pair it up with a 5 gallon bucket, shrink wrap it with a few bows, and the man in your life will love you."
3,Downhill Quality,"I've been a Bucket Boss user for at least 12 years. I prefer a high quality product because I use it every work day which is why I've stuck with the Bucket Boss brand and not a cheaper copycat version. I usually get 2-4 years out of one before the pockets start ripping and it starts to look pretty grungy. I was surprised that the price for a new one was lower than I paid the last time but as soon as it arrived, I knew why. Bucket Boss has cheapened the fabric and left off all of the bottom pocket reinforcements. It won't take long before my tools rip holes in the pockets. They are no better than the copycat versions now, maybe even worse. What a shame! You get what you pay for."
4,Its decent tool holder box....,"Well I bought this one and it is decent no doubt they vary with how many pockets the other brands have but this has many pockets and is sturdy. I think this is comparable to home depot husky to be honest they are almost the same I have both if you dont have a HD around you order it otherwise just get the husky brand which I think may even be a bit thicker canvass, to save on shipping if you dont have to buy it online."
1,Please Don't Buy This.,"This thing is terrible. Please don't waist your money. Also be aware that it doesn't come with the bucket, so you'll have to go out and buy your own."
3,Small Even For a Junior,"I've owned a number of bucketboss products and I generally like them. This item is just on the OK side. It's made of the same material as other Gatemouth bags so it's pretty tough, but it's functionality is low for me. It doesn't have enough pockets and the ones it has aren't all that big. Even the main compartment seems small, I can't fit my drill in there, much less charger and battery. This bag doesn't come with a strap or even hooks to fit a strap on it. Granted, I should've studied the picture closer which doesn't show any of these. This is not the bag for carrying around too long. If you need a bag to put small tools in for home repairs, this is the one for you. For anything else, upgrade."
5,Bucket Boss 066007,I have had my Bucket Boss for about 2 or 3 years. This is one tough tool bag and has a very strong zipper. I think there are some different sizes available but this one is just the right size for my use.
5,Gorgeous CD,"I had both of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir's LORD'S PRAYER albums on LP (MS 6068, and MS 6367, respectively) and was glad to purchased the combined albums on CD. I was disappointed that the Leroy Robertson orchestra-choir version of ""Come Come Ye Saints"" and Gates' version of ""O My Father"" were not included, but that was no doubt due to time limitations on the CD. The remastering was good, but in a way I miss the sonority of the LP versions. I feel these were two of the choir's best albums, and for mainstream choral religious music, one cannot go wrong. The album now may be hard to find, but it is worth having in any collection."
1,Seve loss in quality...,What happend to this band? There debut was just great! When i found out they realesed a new cd i was really excited about it. I started listening to it thouhg and it sounds as if they've changed their entire music style... from good rock to some.... pop culture garbage. The whole cd is almost impossible to listen to! And as stated the last song was terrible. No inspiration just run of the mill pop. I was really hoping this band would do better considering how good he was in his old band. If Day of Fire is gonna keep producing stuff like this they're gonna run into problems real fast.
4,Brothers at War,"Terry A. Johnston's book opens our eyes that the War between the States was anything but civil. The letters in this volume feature the plight of the Campbell brothers...on opposite sides of the conflict. Alexander Campbell's letters are especially important to our understanding of the war, because of their brutally honest portrayal of what the war did to a family caught up in the strife of the times....and more importantly how the war plagued the relationship between a husband and his wife. Johnston is meticulous in his editing....and provides the reader with very detailed notes to keep the story moving along....and easy to understand. This is an enlightening look into what the Civil War did to one particular family, and I highly recommend it to all who have interest in the war."
1,"Theme is overdone, nothing fresh or new","The theme of two brothers on opposite sides of the war has been overdone, and Mr. Johnton (the editor) does not bring anything fresh or new to it. I didn't actually buy this book, but I read a copy. It's okay if you haven't read much civil war stuff before. I give it one star because it didn't really deserve much higher. You guys who gave it five stars probably don't read many books."
1,Don't waste your money. Terrible book.,"I'm a real Civil War buff, and have read many many books on the subject. This one was terrible. Just a boring, haphazard mishmash of letters. It could've been done much better."
5,Peace Of Mind,"Thankfully, I have not had an occasion to use these cables but it's nice to know that they're neatly packed away in my trunk should I need them. They're well made and come in a nice compact case. Just nice to know they're there."
1,AHHHHH!!!!! MAKE IT STOP!!!!!!!,"I HATE KND!!!! My friend put it in when I was riding in the car with him to the beach!!!! The most stupidest episode was Operation B.R.I.E.F!!!!!!!!!!!! It was about this group of weird dorky kids who hire a pair of living underwear to assasinate Numbah 1 the KND's ""leader"". What I always noticed about one of the nerd kids is that one of them wears a football helmet. Why does a nerd dork like him need a football helmet?!?!?! Is he like Darth Vader who needs a helmet to live? OK. Goodbye. I hope my review has told you NOT to buy this product. Good luck in surviving in this constant technology consuming world. Cheerio.Zachary the Rater"
2,No Gatemouth or ridgid bottom here...,"Not sure why this product states a gatemouth or ridgid bottom; the product I received has none of these features. The picture is accurate of what I received; however, the description, and the majority of the reviews here are describing a previous/alternative version of this bag. A simple web search will reveal a photo of the actual ""gatemouth"" product (with a hinged top), but i can't seem to find any venders on line offering that version of the bag. This is still decent bag, but probably not worth the $30 price tag. I'll most likely RMA this product. Bummed ..."
3,Hitachi NR90AE does not fit.,"I bought this because it said ""Extra capacity for full-head framing nailers"" and one reviewer said it fit his Hitachi NR90APR Framing Strip Nailer. He said it was snug, I thought OK, but my Hitachi NR90AE Framing Strip Nailer does not allow the zipper to close at all. The gun falls out of the open end. I like the construction and design but my gun does not fit.Hitachi NR90AE(S) 3-1/2-Inch Full-Head Framing Strip NailerandHitachi NR90ADPR 3-1/2-Inch Clipped Head Framing Strip Nailer"
4,"hipster, funkster, bluesman, r&b","johnny guitar watson is one of my all time favorites. multi-talented, j.g.w. can do it all. you gotta have respect for a man who re-invented himself so many times and was succesful playing all kinds of music."
4,Pretty good book,"This is a pretty good book about American Indians and their difficulties in going into an urban environment. This book can get tedious at times because all the problems the Indians face seem not to be their faults at all, which is hard to believe sometimes. Yes, white society made it difficult for them, as did the urban environment, but the author places most of the blame on these two entities and not even a little on the Indians themselves."
5,Daredevil Bart =),"This is the second best Bart to get if you can't find the original Bart. He comes with his lime green skate board, his helmet, and a comic book. He is very, very durable. I don't think they're too educational, but... He is very fun as long as you have more characters to play with too. He can be interacted with some of the Springfield Interactive* Environments. He's a good character to get first- I got him as my first figure."
1,I Agree With Rip Off.,While I think it is great that I Love Lucy is to be on DVD Ithink Paramount missed the boat when they follow the Star Trekoriginal series release pattern of non season sets.Still the extra material including original openings will be good. I hope they will reconsider and release season box sets or since the seasons were over 30 shows at least semi season box sets.
5,I love lucy Season one vol 1 dvd,If you love lucy now you will like her more on dvd.the lost pilot picture was not the greatest lucy and rikki were at there best . girls what to go to a nightclub look really clear like you were right there with lucy on the set the rest of the disc is about the same picture wise i loved every minute of this disc it worth every penny to get . it has my five stars
5,IF YOU LOVE LUCY...,"Then you'll love this new DVD series which is still in its infancy. The prints are clear and sharp: a real treat for fans of this incredibly beloved series. THE GIRLS WANT TO GO TO A NIGHTCLUB was the first episode aired. Corny? Sure. Hilarious? You bet! BE A PAL is memorable because Lucy thinks Ricky is home sick for Cuba: she goes overboard slightly. Ethel: (reading out of a book) ""I suggest that the wife become a mother"" Lucy: ""I suggest the doctor mind his own business!"" THE DIET is the one where Lucy does a beautiful job once on stage at Ricky's Tropicana club, but she ends up with malnutrition! The PILOT isn't exceptionally funny, yet it was ""missing"" for over 4O years and it's a fascinating sequence for fans who have never seen it: quite different from the series, with Lucy noticeably pregnant with Lucie, her hair much longer, etc."
5,Best show ever,"This is definatly the best show ever. to the reviewer who complained, yes, they could have put more episodes on the disk, but it is only 11 dollars. come on. calm down.I definatly recommend this dvd."
4,Love it!,"This is a great device. It protects my bumper, the wall in front of the car and an occasional argument with my wife about our parking skills!"
3,The perfect stop sign,This fairly inexpensive gadget takes the worry out of parking in your gear age. No more dings or dents. The flashing stop sign insures you never miss it.
1,Terrible Experience,Product took three weeks for delivery. When it arrived the package appeared to be damaged and two parts were missing. The vendor could not replacement the parts nor the product in its entirety. The vendor referred me to the manufacturer for the parts. I have tried for over a month to obtain the missing parts with no luck. The only good aspcet of the whole unfornuate venture was that the vendor did credit my account for the purchase.
4,Works Great!!!,Works as suggested. Easy to see with flashing lights. Easy to assemble. Price was reasonable. Only improvement I would suggest is to make the bottom heavier so that it does not move when tapped by the car. I just used a small bag of sand & it doesn't move anymore!
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"The item will light up when it is moved a certain amount. However, in tight spaces where it is critical that it alerts you as soon as your bumper touches it, it does not perform as advertised. It will generally alert you when it is moved abruptly or at least 4-5 inches. The old ""ball and string"" is more precise than this."
3,WORKS BUT...,"It works but appear cheap and cheesy. Build quality is lacking, not worth $16, more like 8 to $10."
3,Park'N Place,"Does what I needed it for, problem with the light blinking all the time. Had to take the batteries out."
1,Zzzzzzzzzz.....,Can't this author stay on the subject material?Reading this book is like having your forgetful Grandpa read you a story.A book that doesn't cover the subject matter is just not worth the time to read.
4,Most popular toy at the party!,"Got this plane for my one year old nephew. He LOVES it! He will sit on it for hours and make the all of the noises and sounds 'go'. He's not quite able to drive it around yet, but the buttons were easy for him to figure out and he loves the lights on the propellor.As for mom and dad, they loved the hassle-free packaging! So much nicer than all of the difficult plastic packaging, when you've got a little one who wants to play with it NOW!Great purchase!"
4,Great but...,"My son really likes this toy now, but at first he was scared of it because the first time he played with it the propellers hurt his fingers. I have since told him not to touch them anymore but he is 13 months old - he is going to touch them. I'm glad I gave it another shot because he loves it now, but I think they should slow down the propellers a little so it won't hurt little fingers."
3,not as good as the regular series,"this last book was good, but I really didn't like the Friends Forever Series. I hated the way it ended with Stacey and Claud fighting, at least they made up somewhat. I also didn't like how it took them millions of years to graduate eight grade. It would have made more sense for them to be graduating highschool.But, if you are a fan you muct read this because it is the closing book of an awesome series."
5,This is the end...,"This is the last book in the Baby-sitters club series, and also one of the best. The baby-sitters are moving onto high school, after fifteen years in the seventh and eighth grades. So much has happened (they talk about a little of it in the book) and they also talk about how they feel about moving on to the new step... and, unfortunately, we won't be there to witness them.But (and at the end it says this) they won't be best friends forever... they'll just be friends. And I personally don't want to see the end of the friendship...The book is emotional, touching, and funny, and I'm not going to say anything else because you just have to read it for yourself. So much is mentioned, and a lot of stuff you have to find out as you read... this is probably in my top ten books of all time."
5,Mute Bag of Doom,"This bag is known as the ""Mute Bag of Doom"" over at tromboneforum.org. It most certainly lives up to its reputation. I use it to store a trombone stand, several mutes, and all my other rehearsal necessities (light, tuner, metronome, water bottle, slide mix, pencil, small repair kit, etc., etc. etc.) I keep the stand inside the bag, but the level straps on the outside could be used for that purpose too. Overall I'm very happy with the purchase!"
2,He ain't Joe Pike,"The hero seems to be a [copy] of Joe Pike. Not a bad choice,really. In my opinion, it's going to take Publishing Muscleto turn this into a successful series. None of the charactersare fully developed and the story suffers for it. It couldhave been a 4 star novel but the author probably feels that'crime fiction' is beneath him. Well, if the author is whothat Baltimore web site said he is--then crime fiction isactually a step up, IMO. Just google Michael Crow+pseudonymand click on the Baltimore 'city paper' and see who this authormay be. May be, as it's only a guess.I read the entire book so it offers some of what I need froma crime novel. If publishers would just spend some dough ongood editors they could get the money back many fold, IMO..."
3,After a great start the season ends with a whimper,"Okay, I'm a Slayers fan. I really like the characters and the first group of episodes leading up to the first big plot climax is highly entertaining. Also, several of the side episodes following the first plot climax are not only entertaining but laugh out loud funny. But then the last ten episodes or so are an almost complete repeat of the ones before them (and no I'm not just talking about the villan being eerily similar). Things got so repetitive that all dramatic tension was lost with only Amelia and Phil's antics to break up any of the monotony.Fortunately Slayers Next (season two of this series) is an excellent step up and I suppose that most Slayers Next fans will want to see this. It's cetainly worth checking out but the final episodes really leave you with a bad taste in your mouth so it might be a good idea to rent this fist season rather then buying."
3,Funny? haha.,It was okay. I thought it would have a liitle bit more humor to it. It has a few good eposodies.
4,Delightful surprise,"This book was a delightful surprise for me. I bought it at a booth at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books and then walked around the fair with my nose in it, chuckling out loud. A little bit Erma Brombeck and a little bit Robert Benchley, Dr. Alice writes short pithy essays on the extraordinarily funny absurdity of very ordinary life. Fantasy and reality intertwine seamlessly (that's the Benchley touch). For instance, the near-calamatous peeing incident with her toddler on the way to Hawaii probably did happen; the inflatable Titanic II marital aid in Dr. Alice's bedroom probably didn't. That doesn't matter. It just feels great to laugh and be reminded that life is after all a delightful surprise."
5,Great DVD Set - AWESOME Movies !!!,"My dad introduced me to the Naked Gun series when I was really young and at first I thought ""Oh Great - More Dirty Harry crap"", but than I saw this and within the first 3 minutes I was laughing so hard that I was crying :) This really is one of those must own DVD Sets and is TOTALLY worth it!I like the better price too with the 3 DVD set and all the films look so much better on DVD than my old VHS's that I had for years.10 Million Stars !!!"
5,A surprising beginning...,"When i first heard Rubikon was coming to play at my school last year, i was a little skeptical, but i went anyway. (after much convincing by a friend) I was amazed, not only did they play music i liked, but they had there own style, not heavy, not hip hop, certainly not pop, but amazing all the same. I consented to go broke for the weekend in order to by their EP and i am sooooo thankful. They are my fave band, and the only fault they've got is they dont play in Portland enough!!"
3,"Antique Purses: A History, Identification and Value Guide",The book is primarily pictorial with values given for the individual bags shown. Two pages of history in general were included. Expansion of the background information would make the book more enjoyable. Obviously the values are outdated for 1999 but a wide range of bags are included.
5,"I cannot match the expertise of the other reviewer, but...","I find this music hypnotic, haunting, and beautiful -- if you like Leo Kottke, greatly suggest you check this out."
4,brandy and lots more,"brandy is my favorite song of all time.it came out on their first album.another great song on first album is don't it make you feel good.but my favorite album was their second album , subway seranade.it's not in print anywhere so i picked this up to get songs from my old albums on cd. looking glass had great melodies with catchy hooks. give this cd a listen, it will be one of your favorites to. hope someday sony will releseboth of their albums on cd."
2,Not as I remembered it,"This was my sister's signature scent in high school, and I thought of it when I wanted a light floral scent for everyday. I was very disappointed when I received it as it now has a musky overtone that ruins it for me. I am EXTREMELY allergic to musk, not to mention I don't care for the smell, so I don't care if it DOES make the colgne last longer - I can't wear it. Very dissapointed."
4,Good fit but don't like the color,"The fit is good, but when I wear it, it just doesn't look quite right. Most people tell me I look like a cop trying to pretend to be a gang-banger. Since that's not really the image I want to portray I stopped wearing it. But, having a larger head, I struggle to find caps that fit well, and this one really did, so I was bummed that it didn't look good. The fit was five stars, the look was 3 stars, so four stars overall."
1,Save your money,This device is incompatible with the XV6700. Mobile PC.The size of the device is also not correct for the CD adapter.I tried using an adapter for the phone and the device would not even be recognized. Same for loading into a Laptop PC.Go but a real Bluetooth or USB GPS device and save yourself some frustration and money.
5,Over the top awesome. The Serenity and Energy of Jared's music is awe inspiring.,"Queenstown will have you rockin' with the blessings of Our Lord and Savior. Jared has a wonderful voice, you can feel his love for the Lord."
3,1981 - probably not his best year,"I am a huge JD fan. It was painfully obvious to me that he was not all there. This is the guy who always smiled...but, IMHO he seems down, strained, and tired in this performance. A small amount of research (album notes and Wikipedia) revealed that his divorce/separation with Annie was in full swing/very freshly resolved at this point (divorce finalized in 1982). The intermittent grainy video and grainy concert screen were big distractions for me too. I'm sorry to the other posters, but I think the would agree if they watched and listened a little more carefully with these things in mind. Annie's Song is especially tough to watch (I have 5 other videos + live concert memories to compare to)."
3,"Strong Start, Weak Finish","The CD starts out strong, and the first 5 picks are ""irresistible."" But then, the CD falters and it never recovers its initial momentum. The song picks are weak, and they don't hang together. If you don't mind paying full price for less than half a CD, then you'll enjoy. Otherwise, it's bound to disappoint."
5,Jessicas Done It Again,Jessica- THE COOL has done it againI know alot about her and im getting questions here are the questiouns and answersQ) Whyd Jessica Name Her CD IristibleA) Iristible is the name of one of her songs from the show lizzie mcguire.Its on disney channelQ) How Olds JessA) 13
2,Pressure Took Its Toll,"This album is absolutely generic sounding with no personality and spark whatsoever. I don't believe that she is happy with the image that her record company is forcing her to potray, and deep inside, I bet she's not too happy with this album, either. She has talent but she needs to stand up for herself and not allow herself to be bullied by record company execs into being something that she is not. I wish her well and hope that she is able to hold onto who she really is. I gave the album two stars because Jessica's voice is good. Its too bad that she wastes it on flaky songs with absolutely no substance forced upon her by dirty old men w/ nothing but money on their minds. If you want some good R&B tinged pop, try some Destiny's Child or better yet, Deborah Gibson's M.Y.O.B. (Deborah is a new opening act for Nsync and her album is the best pop album I have heard in years...check it out!)."
1,JESSICA SIMPSON THE NEW BRITNEY SPEARS?????????,"Ok, maybe it's just me or I haven't read other people's reviews but 'A Little Bit' sounds identical to Britney Spears! I mean if they were to both sing this song I wouldn't be able to tell which one was singing! I think that this is an improvment, because before she sang songs high and breathy, her voice wasen't strong enough to do that. But it's strong enough for this! I think she needs to fine her own voice, first she imitates Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera very badly, then it's Britney Spears! What's Up with that?"
2,Resistible,"Jessica Simpson has proven with her follow up CD to ""Sweet Kisses"" that she's determined to fit the mold fellow pop queens Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera created before her.One look at the cover, and most people ask themselves, ""is that Britney Spears?"" Simpson has managed to take every cliched sound in pop music along with recycled lyrics to create ""Irrisitible"". It's a disappointment becuase it not only masks her vocal abilities but it clearly shows she is a victim of the mass media."
1,YEAH YEAH YEAH...SHE IS A 1-HIT-WONDER,"ARTIST: JESSICA SIMPSON1 HIT: ""IRRESISTIBLE""ALBUM: ""IRRESISTIBLE""LABEL: COLUMBIA RECORDSHMM...I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE LONG BEFORE I SEE HER ON A 1-HIT-WONDER SPECIAL ON WPOPTV OR MUCH MUSIC!"
4,Fun to sing along to!,"I thought this CD was better than her new ""In This Skin"" CD. The songs were very catchy, upbeat, and fun on ""Irresistable"" whereas in her new CD they sounded more soft and laid back. Her voice was strong and clear and showcased her range much better than her breathy sound on In This Skin. I listen to this CD whenever I want to get pumped up as it lifts my spirits and puts me in a good mood. It's very fun to sing along to, especially tracks 1, 2, 5 and 7. I definitely recommend this CD!"
1,Jessica Simpson Is Not Irrisistable,"Okay, does the world really need any more blonde chicks trying to prove they can sing? Britney & Christina are enough, and they're too much. Stop trying to be like Debbie Gibson & Tiffany of the 80's. Jessica may have a nice voice, but none of her songs are worth listening to."
5,The best of the best,"Every writer has a stack of how-to books. This is the best of the best. Buy it, read it. Soon, you'll read it again."
4,Old 97's are like Dallas...,"Glossy, countrified in some quarters, citified in others, willing to accomodate anyone willing to buy. Not that these are bad traits or that this is a bad album--it's more grown up, more mature, maybe a bit less ""country"" than previous records. But hang on, alt country is on its last legs and a smart boy like Rhett Miller has to stay ahead of the curve, trend wise, so he can still make money making music and not have to go sell insurance. I guess the worst slap in the face, then, is to say this is a trendy band, but no more trendy than any other band out there trying to stay afloat. They want to keep the old fans happy and gain new ones blah blah. Look, this is a good record that does indeed harken back to 80's sugar-coated rock. And they do a fine job of creating that 80's sound with a 90's, low-key sorta country sound. Can you tell I liked this CD?"
2,A DAMN SHAME,"Call me an old-fashioned old 97's fan but I like scrappy, twangy, and raw. It's a damn shame when good guys go soft. I love Chris Isaak, but I don't expect to hear his pretty style from these guys. Dull, ininspired, and like a million other bands. I hope they feel like they got their dynamic back, but I just mourn the loss of another good band to major label overproduction."
3,Lightweight Fight,"Fight Songs is just a bit too generic. Their first two albums had a much more original approach, with a heavier-edged country sound. This sounds too much like the bland college rock of the 80's (Rave Ups, Judybats, etc.)Rhett Miller's songwriting skills are still sharp, though. I guess I just miss that twang."
1,The instigator? Fight songs? Waste of money & time.,"The only albums worse than Fight Songs are instigator and satellite rides. I've opened for this band a few times and seen & heard their music decline as their egos (and paychecks) inflated. It is a terrible thing. I can barely stand to look at them.And yes, I have heard Instigator and I'm not just ""player-hating.""bd"
4,Pop Music For Now People,"It seems like you can divide these reviews for the Old 97s' ""Fight Songs"" into two categories -- negative reviews from longtime listeners who think it pales in comparison to the band's older material, and mostly positive reviews from relative newcomers to the band. Don't let the griping from so-called ""fans"" keep you from buying one of the best pop albums of 1999. This is a terrific album. Anytime a band seeks a bigger audience, there are always going to be people who want to brag about they knew the band before anyone else and what a tragedy it is that the band is reaching out to the unwashed masses. Blah, Blah, blah. Just listen to the CD."
1,"Boring, not as romantic as seems","This movie has too many scenes that deal with cholera. It's pretty nasty. There is like no romance. It looks like the movie is romantic, but there is no romance there."
2,Feminist Nightmare,"I saw this movie six or so years ago, and I loved it. Now that I'm a bit older (feminist grad student)I watched it again remembering how much I liked it the first time around. Well, things change. I don't think the main female character could leave the main male character for more than five minutes without becoming completely lost/in danger/helpless. It was quite funny, yet pathetic. To add insult to injury I think they were going for a ""strong"" and ""independent"" young woman-type in her character. So if this is how they construct a ""strong"" and ""independent"" woman...well I'm sure you get my drift."
2,Horseman could have been a contender,"Horseman on the Roof is a beautifully filmed movie. The acting is good; the script, not so good; the choleric, two-minute transformations from healthy to ""Dawn of the Dead"" puplesque, ridiculous. The plot is rather predictable and mundane. I'm a big fan of foreign films, including the French ones. Overall, this one disappointingly misses the mark. There are, however, several action scenes that are quite good and the cinematography is outstanding."
5,"excellent movie, highly recommended","Hauntingly beautiful, but very sad. If you're a Juliette Binoche fan, you'll really love it. Transaction very smooth, quick delivery."
2,The Horsman on the roof,"the move did not fit the screen, very disappointing for me!most movies fit the television screen but not this one, why not?Horseman On The Roof (Ws)"
3,"Entertaining, but sketchy on facts","This book was a joy to read, but it must definately be taken with a grain of salt. In attempting to justify a long evolution of the human psyche, Sagen credits our fear of snakes with the struggle between humans and dinosaurs and our fascination with the skies with our time spent in the treetops - a bit farfetched, I think. Some of the tidbits thrown in - that humans are the only animals who experience pain in childbirth, for instance - are completely fabricated. Yet I would still recommend this book, for the science presented is made fascinating by the surrounding speculation."
2,10% Science,"This book is composed of 10% science, 10 % anectdotes, and 80% speculation. It would make a good 3 page article in the Sunday supplements if the gibberish were taken out. Such as p87 ""Are our nighttime dreams of flying......nostalgic reminiscenes of those days gone by in the branches of the high forest?"""
4,great book,"This is a fascinating read on the subject of the development of human intelligence and how our species evolved morals, etc. The book is a very good summary of information packaged for the layman but with deep and thought-provoking insights that could serve to stimulate the thinking of experts in the field. Sagan's style is very humorous and engaging.I give this book the demotion to four stars for only one reason: it was a book very much ahead of its time, but it was published over thirty years ago and much of the research cited in it is now obsolete."
5,This is the best of Orlando,"This is, from my personal point of view, the CD that collects the best recordings of Tony Orlando, those previous to his association with Dawn.He is not a very gifted singer, he has not a great voice but with a good choice of songs, songwriters and producers, he is able to sound very well and make excellent recordings.The choice of the material is exemplary, being Gerry Goffin-Carole King the songwriters of many tracks. Carole King has also done the arrangements of some of these recordings, a fact that now adds extra interest in them.This compilation shows how rich in many ways the world of rock & Pop music was during the 60s, it is worth listening to these songs 40 years later and they always sound young and fresh."
4,"As a whole, a fine album","If you want a funny, happy album, buy their self-titled debut. If you want an album displaying incredible music variety and songs that are each amazing in their own right, buy ""Whatever and Ever Amen."" If you want a coherent musical experience where you are transported to a rich, though often melancholic, world, buy this album.This album shows off the band's ability to make beautiful music. The addition of strings and horns at just the right times and Folds' occasionally harpsichord-sounding piano give this album its unique sound. As always, the group harmonizes wonderfully.My only complaint about this album is that it is too short. There are only 11 songs (10 if you don't count ""Your Most Valuable Possession,"" a track in place of which most BFF fans would prefer a real song), resulting in a 40 minute listening experience.""Mess"" is the best song, though on this album it is really unfair to select best and worst songs, since many of them are dependent on each other."
3,Sounds Unfinished,"As a fan (of course) of the last one, I'm disapointed by this one. Many of the tracks seem uninspired or half-finished. Even the stand-out track (Don't Change Your Plans, featuring an almost Bach-like melody at one point) wanders all over the place. Other acceptable tracks: 'Mess', 'Hospital Song', and (by the skin of it's teeth) 'Army'. All other tracks: unacceptable."
4,Truly Amazing,"I too at first was a bit taken back by the album, until I get to track 4 and I then understood immediately the complexity of this release. I then listened to the album over again and understood it completely. This HAS to be one of the best albums of 99 so far, keeping right up there with Ben Lee's Breathing Tornados. Keep it up guys."
5,A trip to a point in your life,"I bought this CD during my stay in Germany, after only haven heard ""Whatever and Ever Amen"". There were a few songs that really stuck out to me at first, ""Army"", ""Dont change...."", ""Mess"", and ""Magic"". These songs were listened to while on many trips through many different countries.Now this CD has a completely different meaning to me. First off ""Dont change..."" is a musical description of something im going through right now. I think thats one of Fold's strenghts; he writes songs that people can relate to, and songs that remind them of a certain point in your life. Musically this album is different that the first two albums. Alot more diversity, and complexity, but not neccesarily better or worse...just different. Ben Folds has proved himself to be a talent, and we can only look forward to him putting out more quality pieces of music like this one. I give it five stars...this CD takes me to a place that i may never see again. I cant wait to see him live in 3 weeks."
3,A little TOO MELLOW!!,"I love the past cds by Ben Folds Five but this cd is a little too mellow. Sorry guys. I know you'll tell me to kiss your (blank) like you do in the ""One Dwarf And 2000 Solemn Faces"" single from your previous cd. But thats my opinon. The vocals in this cd are still good. The keyboards are still good. But I wanted some more jamming rockin tunes. Buy the limited edition if you buy it though, the video that comes in the limited edition is better than the new cd!!"
5,Ben Folds Five Does It Again!!!,"This band has never failed to deliver musical gold, and Reinhold is no exception. The melodies flow just as smoothly as ever, and Folds seems to rely on his solid vocal skills even more this time around. ""Narcolepsy"" is solid, and ""Don't Change Your Plans"" shows just what level of songwriting and crafting this group is capable of. And don't miss the special boxed set version that includes all their music videos."
2,Quite a disappointment,"I never expected to give a rating of 2 to this excellent group, but this album totally lost me. I liked their earlier material because it was different - we haven't had an intense rocking piano player since Jerry Lee Lewis and Joe Jackson. Sadly, the new album drifts for the most part into Elton John territory, albeit with better (and depressing) lyrics. Maybe it will grow on me, I don't know. I liked ""Army"" and ""Your Redneck Past"" , and the way they experiment on tracks like ""Regrets"" is rather interesting, but all in all it was still a disappointment coming from such a great band."
3,"Good melodies, but very toned down from the other two albums","BF5's first two cd's were great and I listen to them very frequently. Ben Folds is quite possibly the greatest talent and songwriter of the decade, right up there with Cobain and Duritz from Counting Crows. The first cd and Whatever were very fun to listen to with imaginative lyrics and great musical talent, but Reinhold is very slow and somewhat boring. There is a lot of talent on this cd, but buy the other two."
2,Not the BF5 I dig,"The previous 2 BF5 albums are perhaps my most-played. I must have at least one of them to get me through any long car drive. If you dig the raw power, boogie-woogie piano, and good humor of past Ben Folds Five albums (as I do), this is not the album for you. After hearing the ""Army"" cut, I went out to get the album. I was disappointed to find out that ""Army"" was the only cut with any of the old-style energy and humor.While I understand the choice to move to a more ""artistic vision"", I just can't get into the new groove. Maybe it's too grown up for me, but when Ben lets loose on the keys, I think those are some of the finer moments in music. Unfortunately, they are not on this album in abundance."
3,Dissapointed-,"BF5's other 2 CD's are great- extremely well performed, original, interesting. This disc is too polished and the energy level is way down from their previous work."
2,"Artistry, shmartistry...","This is the kind of album that makes critics happy and lets fans down. Critics get bored easily and so they need fresh and weird stuff to listen to - this album has lots of it. But much of what I loved about their first few albums is not really here in this one - it's gone, hidden, missing, it's I don't know... matured. Okay. It's great to hear Ben Folds evolve and develop his songwriting skills, but please, just toss in some catchy tunes for the fans."
5,OOOhhhh Yeah!!!,Though the Cd is more mellow than other albums it has fresh perspective and it still kicks major booty. I gotta say its a must have.
4,"Very good, great songwriting, but missing excitement","This Ben Folds' release is musically their best. The songs on this album are very jazz based, and the strings on the album give it a very lush sound. I think that ""Mess"" is an absolute gem. However, it doesn't rock! Not that the older songs did, but they had a youthful energy (such as ""Song For the Dumped"") that seems to lost. If that could combine that old energy with the improvement as songwriters, that would something very special."
4,Ben Folds needs a hug,"This album immediately struck me as an album made by an artist who is sick of hiding behind his mask of humor, yet it is a mask he sometimes enjoys wearing. This CD strikes me as depressing in a Pink Floyd kind of way: good music, but with a melancholic tone that can't be denied. This CD adds a new dimension to Folds' music, and for those who enjoyed ""Evaporated"" off of ""Whatever and Ever, Amen"", this is right up your alley, a dark alley though it may be. And there's nobody else in it."
4,A departure indeed,"People who liked BFF because they sounded like Elton John, Billy Joel or Dave Brubeck will be shocked. This album sounds more like Radiohead's OK Computer, or Beck's Odelay! (or Dexy's Midnight Runners). I was glad to see the two hypersuccessful Carrboro/Chapel Hill, NC acts collaborating on this album (Squirrel Nut Zippers are the other)."
4,Just what I needed.,"I bought this pillow during the last half of my pregnancy because I had started to have significant tailbone pain when sitting for too long, or even getting up from short periods of being seated, especially from low seats (which for me, ended up being almost every seat). I didn't want the inflatable kind that was sold in most stores as I was afraid it would tear. This pillow, while it doesn't look that it would give you that big of a boost, was just what I needed. It worked in the car, on the sofa, on the floor when I had to set up baby's nursery, restaurant booths, etc. What a relief! My only gripe is that it came in white, which of course, dirties easily. I haven't tried washing the cover yet; it's not a zip-up all around kind of cover, but one that has a vertical slit in the back, so I'm hoping I'll be able to take it off the foam pillow inside and wash it."
2,Not for me,"The white cover of this cushion is impractical - my cushion fell on the floor, and the dog thought it would make a marvelous bed to sleep on. She drooled on it, and got a stain on the cover. The cover is very, very difficult to remove and I haven't dared try to do so as I'm not entirely certain if I can get it back on if I do remove it to wash it.The cushion itself was too firm for me. I would return it back to Amazon, but due to my dog leaving a stain on the cover, I can't. I guess it will at least make a good dog bed, since my dog seems to like sleeping on it."
3,good IF.....,"This doughnut ring is a really good one IF you can get past the smell. It is really offensive. I have sprayed it repeatedly with Febreze and it still smells horrible. I will keep spraying, however, because it really does work quite well as far as providing relief from pressure to the backs of the legs and buttocks."
1,bought to add to music collection,"added this cd to my collection, i have a large music collection and currently working on the 70's. one or two songs on this cd, take you back, you really dont need the rest."
5,electricify yur soul album.,"my dad has this in his lp collection, it's a great blues rock album with soul&passion makes you want to dance , sing & cry maybe. but it a great recording no nonsense jammin that empowers your soul with a charge of excitement that comes off the recording. feel the electric vibe. highly recommended for people who like cream , joplin etc. dig it man!"
4,Leupold PRW high scope mount,"Very hefty and sturdy product. Made of steel, not aluminum. Gives a nice tactical look to the scope. Only quirk is you have to snap the top ring quite forcefully to the bottom mount in order to install it. Like the other reviewers have mentioned, there are no scratches from this process. Once installed, the scope is very easy to rotate or adjust. Highly recommended.My set up: Nikon P-22 (2-7X)scope mated to Sig-522 Swat Commando. The high ring gives perfect mounting height and eye relief. This ring is probably an over-kill for a 22-LR set up. But, it exudes quality and should last forever."
1,Absolutly terrible,"This software is a mess. It couldn't have possible been tested. The software crashes constantly and has to be re-installed (including going through a RESEDIT procedure). The crashes come constantly when doing the most mundane things like adding a task to a project --- useless software, stay away."
3,quality of movie went down due to the actress.........,I really wanted to like this movie...but whoerever caster the Helena or watheverher name is ...really messed up. So we have this skinny little clean girl thatis investigating the Nazis and .....why bother....i really did'nt care for heracting as it messed up the movie....she did get a bit better near the end whenfinally her face got dirty..but it was too late...Looks like the filmaker wanter a female hero to continue the series...bad moveand to add more insults....they left the end of the movie opened for anotherchapter.....that ticked me off....cant they just create good movies with qualityending instead of looking for the next mini series.good for a view....rent it ...only pay when the movie is worth it...not this one.
1,Horrible sequel and as poorly lit as AVP Requiem...,"Right out of the gate... when the little woman grabs the hand of the former SS soldier, why did he just sit there and take the pain, and not just punch her in the face? the whole movie was dark and lame. what a shame."
2,Micro Clamp,"Although Irwin makes quality tools, this is not 1 of them!stationary pad is loose and will not tighten fully, will not tighten enough and after only a few simple use's began to slip. I contacted Irwin and they promptly sent me a replacement without requiring me to return the old 1 (just had to send a picture prior to replacement) new 1 is only slightly better. I have the larger models and they are great."
3,problems with game play,"This game would have been really great except for the fact that there is problema with the gameplay.The monkey has problems double jumping and holding on to high bars etc.,Be prepared for a frustrating time of falling and starting over, other than that the levels are still fun if you can take the pain."
5,Damita SO FINE,This lady is one of the most unheralded pop/jazz/r&b female singers ever. SHE CAN SING!!!!
5,This is the smoothest song on this earth!!!,Maxwell is a true talent! I love this groove! It's sultry like a waterfall. Maxwell has true God given talent and it's heard with this song!
4,Nice but could be better,"Bought this long ago for trim/finish work and they work nicely; at least for the price. Could use a set-up for a tri-square and the strap around the neck is to thin, cuts into neck. But for around the shop or for minimal tool requirements, the price is right and works well.Sugest to Bucket Boss- Improve straps (wider and padded over shooulders) and add more compartments (set of hanging pockets in front of existing...like carpenters coverals). Then charge a bit more and they will sell!"
2,"Another product not worth really ""using"".","I purchased this hoping for the same quality that I had experienced with my ""Bucket Boss"" nail/tool pouch. The weight distribution is good but the quality of the sewing is very poor in the pockets. This one problem makes this purchase not good at all. The sewing started to come apart in the 2nd week of use. I use this everyday and am now looking at other brands.This may work well for you if you don't do any work and carry nothing in it. If you need it to work for you long term forget it. Where are the products that last and don't weigh a ton without tools ?"
4,Satisfied,I have been looking for something to use in my garage to hold my tools but yet wasn't a pain to carry around. This helped out tremendously.
2,SpazeDevize-----A bump with a slump,"Source Direct is a deep comatose album with a taste for dungeouns with Kickers built in the walls. The darkest Drum N' Bass I have heard to date, but not the best. There is seclusion in every track that is making minds waiting for the next break to be even blood-flowing than the other. ""Technical Warfare"" boosts the mind-frame for chopped movements to be made by robots that animate through my mind, but ""Love And Hate"" is the worse Drum N' Bass jam I have heard in my life. This album needs some ingredients to be as potent as other Drum N' Bassers making their chic beats. Social brain-storming on this album is not worth the nerve to burn. I have heard better and I have heard worse. This album sits in my case collecting dust and who knows what to film it's cause of ignorance from my music machine. Take my advice. I think you would rather buy a Barnes & Barnes album."
3,"Dark, fast and good, but just.","If you aren't into jungle/drum-n-bass already, don't get this. There might be a couple of tracks that really move you, but you might feel cheated by the whole CD. A couple of the tracks are on earlier releases, and at a measly 9 songs already, I thought that was cheating a bit on the artists' part. If you're going to re-release stuff anyway, give me more to listen to; more bang for my buck than 9 cuts. Despite all that, I do enjoy the record, and I've been playing it for awhile. It's dark...some of it sounds like outtakes from an ""Alien"" soundtrack (which is funny, since one of these tracks appeared briefly in the movie ""Blade"", but not on the soundtrack), and some of it is a little more playful than I figured they'd be, but all in all an okay record. Just don't buy it before some other things you might be looking at (stuff by Goldie, especially)."
4,Deep Tunes,"This CD is a dark collection of beats and I found myself diving into the songs. I do not know much about Source Direct, but from listening to this album I may buy more of their stuff."
4,pie iron,"Great little book with lots of easy recipes to try for camping. It uses normal, everyday ingredients which is what I look for in a cookbook!"
5,"A great CD, no matter how old you are!","Yes, everyone says it sounds like a little kid's CD, and yes, everyone says they sound like Aqua. But the great thing about them is that once you listen to them, you have to listen to them over and over because the songs are so catchy! I especially love ""Best Friend"", ""The Sailor Song"" and ""Tarzan and Jane"". Their new album is OK too.GO BUY THIS CD!!!!"
5,"Gambling, stealing....",The Sailor-Song is so funny and the song is really nice. Anila and Amir really sing wonderfully. The song is not really about sailors from this time. It applies to the sailors centuries ago.
3,"fun, but not worth forty bucks","Toy-box is known for very childish and meaningless lyrics, but isn't that what we need sometimes? Maybe they dont have the insight of radiohead or the beatles, and I'm not saying that Toy-box is equal to those bands in greatness, but they make make music that sounds good. It makes you want to dance. And you have to give them that. Still, Tarzan and Jane is not some spectacular masterpeice, and I wouldn't pay forty bucks for it. Go buy the teletubbies soundtrack. It gives you the same happy, carefree feeling."
5,Toy-Box? Mamma Mia! oh my!,"They can dance. They can jive. Having the time of their lives... That's what Amir and Anila are doing in all their songs. These two are just wilin' out. We wish more people in real life could have this carefree attitude. Don't listen to the boring hatas here. It's Toy-Box for life. Songs for us are Super-Duper Man, The Sailor-Song, Best Friend...just hear everything."
5,Just what I wanted!,"This is a great product. Can be used on a table to elevate the back of the keyboard, or on your lap (either flat or folded in half) to keep your legs cooler."
2,Did not work; flimsy,"I thought this would be exactly what I wanted to raise my laptop to eye level and slant the key board for comfortable use. Intended to use at desk. While it accomplished those tasks, my laptop didn't sit flat and bounced when typing. Didn't stay put, worked its way down the thing. It is possible my Dell was too heavy. Thingie to hold slant very flimsy. Returning and continuing search."
5,"Billy Joe Royal still ""spins my wheels""!","I recently saw Billy Joe Royal in concert here in Vermont and listening to him brought back some wonderful memories of my preteen years when he was so popular with his song ""Down In The Boondocks"", etc.; I didn't even know he was still performing - what a delight! After seeing him in concert I was compelled to seek out his music and was pleasantly surprised to find several choices at Amazon. This CD is awesome in every sense of the word; Billy Joe's style tugs at the heart."
5,Hard to Find,"I bought this item for my 3 1/2 year old son for Christmas. He loved it!!! It is the most realistic figure out there for Spiderman. Unfortunately, he was pretending to battle the ""Green Goblin"" with his brother and his brother hit Spiderman too hard and his legs broke off. Impossible to put back together. Also, after taking his mask off several times, the mask has started to rip. Here it is, 1 month after I purchased it and I can't find another one anywhere. I have even gone to the manufacturer and can't get one."
3,book report material,"This is the user manual that you get when you buy a Laptop Lunch system. (which i own, and which works very well for packing a typical American's lunch.)It is about two thirds lessons on resources, recycling, and how much Americans throw away, and one third information about nutrition and packing lunch. If you are already aware of the need to reduce our dependence on plastic wraps, school lunches, high sodium tasteless preserved food,etc. then you wont find anything new here.there are only a few recipes in this book, and if you are looking for lunch recipes you would be better served by buying a true recipe book. One thing you MAY wish to get this book for would be a school report. This book has a LOT of information that a child (or PTA member) could use in discussing school nutrition, reducing waste and related topics."
3,"good acting, but weird story","I like the actors, the movie seemed to be well made, but it was just a weird story! I don't think I would ever watch it again."
3,Too bad indeed.,"I, like the previous reviewer, have been upset at the releases that had been long lost of this wonderful vocal artist. Gloria was backed by the talent of a great pianist Herman Foster, with Grisella Oliphant on drums. Foster explodes on the song I'm Glad There Is You and later recorded two or three lps on the Epic label which are reminescent of early Red Garland and Gene Harris. Sadly Lynn got little opportunity to really break out of the all too brief ""pop"" period of success she had and so even today, with all the re-released recordings..she is unknown to even accomplished singers"
4,Plenty of Good Stuff Here,"Tommy Tutone enjoyed a short heyday during the peak of New Wave in the early 1980s. The first two Tutone albums contained an array of power pop--music with hooks and an edge. There are at least five or six great tunes on this CD. Jenny (867-5309 is their best-known song and may also be their best. But songs like Baby It's Alight, Angel Say No, Cheap Date and Which Man are You, among others, are worth a serious listen. If you're into the music of the New Wave period, definitely check this CD out."
1,Not up to this author's standard and a bad narration to boot,"This book-on-tape has a potentially interesting plot, but it is deeply buried beneath two layers of dullness: its lead character and the narrator. The lead character is in the category of teenagers in horror movies, i.e., doing stuff so stupid that you want to yell out to stop them. (E.g., how many times can someone talk to the FBI against their lawyer's clear advice and still be surprised that it doesn't work out? Or is it possible that a young surgeon knows less about DNA than the average TV viewer?) It's so implausible that my disbelief became unsuspended.Moreover the narrator who recorded it settles into an annoying sing-song that leaves all sentences sounding sort of alike and that has little variation from character to character. It's hard to listen to.I miss this author's great lead character, Myron Bolitar (who is funny and smart), but I'll settle for a lot less. This is just not anywhere near satisfactory."
3,Riveting Thriller,"This is a fast-paced murder mystery ~~ and riveting. I picked this book up at my hairdresser's and finished it in two days. I have never read Coben's books before and was not disappointed by this one ~~ it's engrossing.Dr. Marc Seidman lies in a hospital bed after being shot twice by an unknown assailant. His wife is murdered and his six-months-old daughter is missing. This is just the beginning. The police suspects Marc as the guy behind the kidnapping and the murder of his wife. Desperate to find his daughter and to find the truth ~~ Marc didn't allow anyone to stop him from completing his quest.As the mystery unravels ~~ so did Marc's suspicions. The truth lies closer to home than he ever realized.It is a fun book ~~ perfect for a long dreary winter night. It is a definite fast-paced thriller. If you like murder mysteries, this is a good one. It's suspenseful enough to keep you on the edge of your seat.1-10-05"
4,HARLAN COBEN- Always Worth Reading,"NO SECOND CHANCE by Harlan Coben is yet another of his fast moving thriller-mysteries. I always enjoy Coben's efforts. Shot and left for dead with his wife dead close by is only the beginning oof Dr. Marc Seidman's troubles. His enfant daughter is missing too. The ransom demand comes and the story is off and running. As always Coben delivers a fast tale, but I for one could have had a better ending. I recommend this book and any of Coben's."
5,One of the best novels in years,"This novel is one of the best Harlan Coben ever wrote. Marc Seidman's idyllic world is brutally ripped apart when he is gunned down in his home. Twelve days later he wakes up in the hospital to learn that his wife is dead and his baby daughter Tara is missing. A ransom demand is made and agreed to. But something goes terribly wrong. The kidnappers escape, and Marc remembers the ransom note's ominous warning: there will be NO SECOND CHANCE. An agonising eighteen months pass with no word. And then, as Marc has just about given up all hope of seeing his daughter again, a package arrives with a note attached: WANT A SECOND CHANCE? The note is chilling, but Marc sees only one thing: the chance to save his daughter. And, haunted by deception and deadly secrets - about his wife, about an old love, and about his own past - he vows to bring Tara home ... at any cost. If you are looking for an excellent novel, that you cannot put down, NO SECOND CHANCE is the book for you"
3,if u get this 4 jtt...DONT,"OK B MOVIE... IF U R A JTT FAN AND ITS THE REASON FOR BUYING...DONT, HIS ACTING SUCKS AND HE IS BARELY IN IT... HE MADE A MISTAKE TRYING TO PLAY THIS ROLE"
4,a good collection of songs,"i really dug this disc and the songs Love is strange,I'm so glad,Walkin' in the rain among the others.Mickey&Sylvia had a good solid Chemistry."
5,Jason Robert Brown's best,Jason Robert Brown has created an utterly depressing musical with some great music. He escapes from his over-writing habits for much of this show. The score is one of a kind and an essential for any MT buff.
5,"great musical, great soundtrack","I loved seeing this show so much, I saw it twice in the same month, the cast was amazing and so was the story. Who would've thought that such an amazing show would come from such a sad story."
3,Last Five Years is Better,"The score for ""Parade"" is not bad, but I enjoyed Brown's ""The Last Five Years"" so much more!"
1,"Down, Downer, Downest","Two of the best recent new musicals were Ragtime and Passion. Neither were musical comedies. Both were seriously themed, with very few light moments. Both were saved by the immense skill of the composer, lyricist and librettist. Parade was also created by skilled artists, but believe me, Berlin,Kern and Gershwin couldn't brighten up this downer. They say Olivier could read you phone book and make it interesting. He was smart enought to never try. Why intelligent professionals thought they could make a musical out of a lynching is a mystery to me!"
4,This is the greatest thing for trips and when your bored,this is awesome.I have had it for about a month and i already love it.when I get bored i just go in my room and play before i know it i was playing for a half hour.I also love it on trips even if its just an hour drive it makes time fly.P.S. it is also is very durable and even if you drop it once or twice it won't break!!
4,An Heroine Who's Not Flawless For a Change!,"I really love a book with a flawed heroine, and this one has it. Julie lies. She lies herself into a big bad corner, and it makes me just relate to her. I like a heroine who's not perfect, who messes up every once in awhile, sometimes HUGELY (just like me.) It also reminded me a little bit of Moonstruck, with the falling for the best friend (or brother in MS) thing. ;) VERY SEXY."
2,Book 3 predictible,"It was the third in the series, and much too predictible. I kept reading because of the first book, but in the end, it completely fizzled out. I was very disappointed in the writing. Yet I'd already purchased Book 4 and went on to read it. It was better."
1,Contains LEAD in hazardous amount,Please always look up toys before buying them-- so many are manufactured in unregulated factories and contain toxic metals and plastics!Healthystuff.org lists this toy as having high lead content and medium chlorine.
1,"Is this really for babies??? At most, its BAD. At worst, its UNSAFE.","I really, really wanted to love this item. The idea is fantastic-- developmental activity center that hangs down into the playpen and provides babies with stimulation and play.In reality, though, this things is useless and possibily dangerous. BE WARNED!The first issue is that its heavy and unstable. The first time my baby swatted at it, it fell off the side and landed on him. Very frightening and unsafe.The second issue is that the little gadgets on it are FRUSTRATING. The lids don't stay closed, the twirly things are difficult to maneauver. It requires the dexterity of a toddler, but is intended for babies.Not recommended."
5,What A Fantastic Toy,I do not agree that this was an annoying toy. The sounds were not that loud. My daughter LOVED this toy. This toy had to go everywhere with us. There was so much to look at and she LOVED the bright colors. She enjoyed flipping it over to see what was on the other side. I think that this toy was well worth the money we spent on it. I would recommend this to to everyone!!
4,Great Toy!,"I bought this toy originally to put in my daughter's pack n play, but realized that I can also use it in her play yard hanging on the side. it is also great to use as a free standing toy and has two sides for multiple uses. Overall, I love it and so does she."
2,Extremely Technical,"I was looking for some information to re-fresh my memory after two black and white photo college courses, so I turned to this book. Although I am sure it is very well written, it was very confusing and too technical for the little information of was searching for. I am going to put it on my bookshelf for reference, maybe after a few more classes. It does give great ideas on how to create different effects, but I feel I need a little more experience first."
5,Great Quality and Good Read,The book came in great condition. It arrived earlier then stated and the book is very easy and fun to read
5,excellent book,This is the best book of the series in my opinion since I am planning to go into virology.
3,Good for its price,Perfect holding LP's (if you still have any). They look cheap up close but who wants to get that close to a cabinet?
4,cute story,"We were in search of a story on ""transportation"" for our preschool class. One of the moms suggested this title and it turned out to be the right fit for the need. The story is clever and the illustrations are simple, old-fashioned, and funny. ""Just what the......."" teacher ordered."
4,Pretty Good,"This is a pretty good book. I think that kids will enjoy it. I've had it since I was a little kid. It's a real ""Happily Ever After"" tale. It's very ironic in the eyes of an older person. You'll see small ironies in the names. I ony havew one question: What happened to the bus driver's bus? Was it alright? Read this book and let me know your opinion"
5,The Best Spider-Man and Action Figure EVER!,"By far this is the ultimate action figure ever. The colors are great and feels very durable. I love the fact he has 30 or so moving joints. He can stand on his own and stays at the pose you put him in. His size is the best, he's about 6 1/2in. compare to your averge 5in. fugures. I've own this toy since it came out way back in May 07' and still looks like new. A must have for all collectors and Spidey fans."
1,HIDDEN DANGER!!!,"This is a durable and detailed action figure, however there is hidden danger in the gargoyle accessory. My 4 1/2 year old came to me screaming while holding his pinched finger. I did not know what he meant when he said his toy hurt him until I pressed the gargoyle recoil button. It was then that the excessive recoil action caused the clasp on the end of the cable to pop me on my fingertip. Since it was painful to me I know it would be painful to a youngster. If the action figure is not attached to the end of the cable, there is a dangerous whipping action from the rapid recoil. As my son and then I found out this whipping action can be painful, but perhaps more of a concern would be a serious injury that could happen if this occured to close to the face. This is probably the only concern with an otherwise fun toy."
5,tuns of fun 2,"I bought this action figure, and was amazed at all the articulation on it, even his ankles can move, it's great. along with the green goblin this is by far one of the best figures of my vast collection."
3,Not Enough,"Yes its very good and long over due. After first hearing this band some twenty years ago in the film The Girl Cant help It and going crazy over Cinnamon Sinner I say where is it! why leave it off, I thought my wait was over. Oh well just enjoy folks. While I continue to try and find it and fill in the gap."
3,A Satisfying Conclusion to the NJO,"Finally, the conclusion to the New Jedi Order.I did not particularly like this series, but being a huge Star Wars Fan, I slogged through all of the books in this series.In this conclusion, James Luceno sets out to wrap up the series in what, to me, could have been done in 350 pages as opposed to the 520 that the novel wraps up with. The novels drags for about the first 400 pages, setting up with the climactical ending in the Coruscant system. I will say that after the drag of the first 400 pages, the last 120 was home to one of the best Star Wars endings since Timothy Zahn's 'The Last Command.'I would say to read this book, just so you can see what direction the Star Wars franchise is going to take, and to see Luke and Jacen Solo kick some Yuzhaan Vong butt in the end."
2,The NJO finally ends....,"This one though could easily have trimmed a hundred or so pages and still accomplish what it set out to do. I mean the first 50 pages or so just recap the previous novels. I don't know about you but if someone is picking up the final book in a 19 part series without having read any of the previous--they deserve to be left in the dark. Don't subject us to this crap.The story is decent, though crapping out at the end, especially in the resolution with the Vong and the cop-out save from Sekot. Jacen, who went from lamest character ever to coolest in the span of a few books, is somewhat his post-traitor self. Jaina is still a b****.The voyage was long, and there was some good to come out of this series, but I think we can all be happy that it's over."
3,Unifying Force,"As a long time Star Wars fan and reader I have read and anticipated every book in this series. I had my doubts about how long it went on not the usual three or four book arc, but I checked bookstores and online constantly. Unifying force was disappointing. I was really looking for more and felt like they dropped the ball. Maybe there should have been one more book, but even though I look forward to what is next this one let me down.I just felt that some of the answers were a bit rushed because of the monumentous job before the author. I also didn't know where things were heading for instance the Jedi should be more together than ever and to me seemed more or less fractured and split to the winds again. Seeing as over half their numbers had been eliminated."
3,Kris Kross Wannabes!,"These little tikes R just Kriss Kross wannabes! look at them! and then look @ kriss Kross, can I say Copy kiddies? these little 6 and 7 yr old boys R good at some of there stuff, where the little soljas at is the only track where I liked the whole thing, the rest was kinda weird, cuz they rap about mamas new blouse, snacks after a nap and girls with their rooms clean, why R these tots signed 2 a big time record company? If they were older they would pry be real good, there other songs, well, some of 'em have a good chorus. But I think they should have waited till they were older!"
3,Its okay,This produce is good as in healthy but if you want the color to come out as you buy its not going to hold for long. I think its to pricy for it to be doing that. I will recommend this to people with short and natural hair.
3,Reasonably good performances of some very good music,"There are a few familiar melodies in this collection, from the world-famous Lullaby (a classic!) to Hungarian Dance Number 5. I would have liked more allegro-paced tunes but that's just me. There's a good selection here for someone who's interested in hearing some of Brahms' most popular, best-loved works."
1,horrible quality,"I'm writing this review after owning the Lupah for a couple of years. One of the digits came off the face and is floating around. Called the customer service - apparently they warranty the quality for only 1 year. ONE YEAR!! And this is a swiss watch! Not cheap either! Now they want me to pay for the repair - but they wouldn't tell me what the repair will cost. To determine that I have to send in the watch along with $20.The crystal is of very poor quality too. It scratches very easily.I can guarantee you - your Lupah will look all banged up in just a short while. That is, if it still works.Not what I expected from a swiss watch."
5,Kudos to Jeff!,Jeff Coffins departure from the tones shines his capibilities once again. I greatly enjoyed seeing his play with the Bela Fleck and the Flecktones earlier this year. What an excellent musician.
3,Note: A Firmware upgrade is available for download.,If you are having problems with this drive please note that the manufacturer has made a firmware revision. The firmware upgrade is available on the Pacific Digital website.
1,DO NOT BUY PACIFIC DIGITAL PRODUCTS!!!,"I BOUGHT A PACIFIC DIGITAL EXTERNAL CD BURNER FROM AN INTERNET SELLER. IT CAME BRAND NEW IN A SEALED BOX WITH ALL THE WARRANTY CARDS AND EVERYTHING. I AM HAVING TROUBLE INSTALLING IT SO I CALLED PACIFIC DIGITAL SEVERAL TIMES FOR HELP ONLY TO GET VOICEMAIL. MY EMAILS WERE NEVER ANSWERED EITHER. WHEN I FINALLY GOT THROUGH SOME INDIAN SOUNDING GUY TOLD ME I COULDN'T GET SUPPORT BECAUSE I BOUGHT IT FROM AN ""UNAUTHORIZED SELLER""!!THAT IS UNCONSCIONABLE!!! THIS COMPANY WILL BE OUT OF BUSINESS SOON BECAUSE THEY DO NOT STAND BY WHAT THEY SELL."
1,depressing,"In this dreadful book only one positive event takes place when the neighbours rally to fix up Marie's house and even that seems shallow and pointless. Beside the two sons who I pitied, I thouroughly detested the entire cast of characters. The only reason I finished the book was in fact the hope that the two boys might escape that depressing place. Of course I was utterly disappointed."
2,"Too many words, not enough content","Mary Morris could have written Songs in Ordinary Time in 300pages, and it would have been a good story. The book just went on andon and on....... I felt if she did not shoot that scam artist and get him out of her life, I would for her. It took a lot of patience to finish this book."
1,not worth the time,"I just think that you can spend your time reading other books that are better written, more enticing, smarter and much more moving. I was simply bored."
2,YIKES!,"I started reading this book two months ago...and I am not a slow reader. Disgusted, I would put it down and not be able to return to it for weeks at a time. The characters are remarkably uninteresting and truly pathetic at the same time. I finished it yesterday because I am so compulsive that I couldn't just throw it in the trash can, but I will have to rethink that now!!!! This was 740 pages of good reading wasted."
1,Deeply disappointed,"This book was a terrible disappointment. It's decidedly anti-Catholic bent made for a disturbing read. I've lost a lot of respect for the judgement of Oprah, or those who select the books for her club, in this selection. I've not been entirely impressed by all the club's selections but this one was particularly poor. The gross descriptions and disfunctional characters weren't worth the time it took to read."
1,don't waste your time!,"There just wasn't much point to this book...it goes on and on and on, leaving the reader wondering where it's taking you and what's the point. It's incredibly depressing with NO characters who are people to admire or aspire to...I didn't like any of the people in the book and the mother, the central character, is the worst. Don't waste your time, there are plenty of better books to read!"
2,It goes on & on & on-- & FINALLY it ends-honestly.,"This book doesn't hold a candle to Map of the World by Jane Hamilton, another Oprah recommendation. It is WAY too filled with unimportant details in a writing style that certainly is very easy to read but offers NOTHING noteworthy in it's style. Evil man comes into town and walks over people one by one, over and over and over again, ad nauseum. Is it actually possible that ALL these Vermonters were this naive back in the '50""s? I hardly think so, or they must have started adding IQ's to our water supply over the past 20- 30 years. Why did I read to the end? Good question. I guess cuz I paid good money for the book so I wanted to find something redeaming about it. Also I kept thinking maybe it would finally GO some place. which it didn't, although the last 100 pages are a bit more substantive, plot-wise. Forget this one."
2,A VERY LONG AND SLOW READ!,"I'm glad to see that so many readers find this book as slow and unmoving as I do. I can honestly say that I don't like one character in the story. I have been reading this book for almost six weeks now and I am on the verge of putting it down once and for all! I hate not finishing a book, but based on the other reviews that I have read, it sounds as if it might not be worth it. Every time I read it, I find myself disgusted with at least one of them: Marie, Sam, Father Gannon, Omar. I feel sorry for the other half; I can't decide who is most pathetic: Renie, Alice, Benjy, Haddad.The list goes on. I wish I could understand why the author felt this was a story worth writing. I have yet to feel close to or empathize with any of the characters. I cannot wait to be finished and move on to a more satisfying read."
1,unmemorable,"I read this book about a year ago...it was the next pick on the Oprah list and was raved about so heartily I figured it must be great! Then I got the book and struggled through it praying it would get better but it never did and by the end of the book I was sure I had ordered the totally wrong book, but no. It was the right book, just not the right book for me. I just didn't get it and never warmed up to any of the characters. I cannot imagine why it was rated so highly by Oprah."
3,Readable but slow,"Tough to get into. Beginning was slow and confusing. There were too many characters thrown in at once. Once you figure out who's who it does move along, albeit slowly. One thing that I appreciated was Morris' effort to fully develop each character so they weren't just good/bad guys. There was a depth to each of them which made them more real. I was a bit frustrated with the characters. You kind of want to slap each one of them and point them in the right direction and tell them what they're doing wrong. I kept hoping the next page would be a bit more uplifiting or bring some good fortune to this bunch of losers. But it's a slow, painful death and the only reason I got through it was because I found myself liking some of the characters and hoping for their well-being. Not the kind of book to make you feel warm and fuzzy, if that's what you're looking for"
3,Pity pushed me to the end...,The main characters in the book were so sad...I kept reading hoping that things would get better for them somehow. Then it just ended! This book should not be read by anyone who is already depressed.
2,After 740 pages I STILL DON'T CARE!,"I waited until we went on vacation so I could savor Oprah's ""Summer Winner"". After ploughing through the book, I wished I had spent the time with a comic book. It might have left me with a better taste in my mouth. Marie and her brood were just too clueless and Omar sailed into the sunset too rue-less."
1,A Pack of Whiners,"Hands down, the worst of the Oprah books. Not one likable character in the bunch. Not once ounce of nobility. Pointless from beginning to end. Go sit in front of the TV for 24 hours. It would be a much better way to spend your time"
2,What a depressing book!,"The writing here is basically good (or I wouldn't have finished it), but the characters and stories are SO depressing, I'm sorry I spent so much time reading it. At times I felt like I was reading someone's classroom assignment to explore characters in depth. I know that not every story has a happy ending, but I kept hoping for some sort of redemption for any of them, especially Marie, and it never really came. I've generally enjoyed the books Oprah selected, but this was a real downer -- I never felt like I ""connected"" with this book"
5,A real page-turner with well-developed 3-D characters.,Mary McGarry Morris has a great way of describing her characters without being long-winded. It didn't seem like 740 pages because I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next.
4,"Very long, extraordinarily written, painful for women, sad.","I read this book while on a cruise. Found it difficult to concentrate on because of the difference in surroundings than that of the book. Had empathy for Mary, who in the end was no better off than in the beginning. If I were the author, she would have won a $5,000,000 lottery and lived happily ever after with Tom Cruise. That's why I am not the author!! I am not sorry I read the book, but did have a difficult time getting through it"
2,Scent lasts about 1 or 2 days,"Makes the whole house smell great for about 1 or 2 days but that's it. I have yet to find a furnace filter air freshening product that lasts for more than a very short time. I've bought these FilterFresh ones in several scents. Cinnamon seems to be the strongest and will last about 2 days. I have loved the fragances of them all, I just wish they lasted longer and were much less expensive. I would gladly pay a couple bucks for one if it worked even for just a week.These would work well for an open house, overnight guests or hosting a party. Very short term stuff."
1,Total waste of money,I do not recommend this product to anyone. Lasted just two days. Total waste of money. Bought two of them and each worked exactly the same way
3,Not his best book,"I have read three of Arturo Perez-Reverte's books: this one, ""The Club Dumas,"" and ""The Flanders Panel."" I was somewhat disappointed in this one. Don't get me wrong, he still has his old style: great description of characters, nice prose, etc., but this story just didn't get my interest as quickly as ""The Club Dumas"" or ""The Flanders Panel."" It was a very fast read, which could be either a bad thing or a good thing. The other two books had some sort of ""hook,"" but this one didn't. I must say I was slightly disappointed, but I will continue to read this author. If you've never read this author before, read the other books first, then read this one."
3,"Interesting diversion, but not his best work","What saves this work is the richness of its characters and the vivid descriptions of a Spain torn apart. The honorable Jaime Asterloa is an anachronism at best and a fool at worst, but he redeems himself in the end by being true to his code. It's hard not to feel some pathos in the tradition of the Greek tragedies. The dark Dona Adela would tempt any red-blooded man, and most would not fare as well as Don Jaime. As in all tragedies, in the end everyone loses something dear - a life, a future, a way of life.Still, this isn't Perez-Riverte's strongest work. Best is The Flanders Panel, followed by The Club Dumas and The Seville Communion."
4,"Interesting, but predictable, mystery","As someone who has fenced before and practices swordsmanship, I found the descriptions of the fights and fencing technique in this book very fascinating! The author clearly did his research. The mood and atmosphere of the story are done quite well too. Though the story itself is somewhat predictable, especially at the end. The end itself, and the fight were very well done, but the storyline was a typical Hollywood movie of the week style. You know where it's going halfway through the book and you can guess how it ends.I've seen the print version of the book and I own the Kindle version. I've already notified Amazon, but the Kindle version is terribly formatted with missing punctuation throughout the book."
2,Should have spent more money on the translation...,"Being an avid fencer I was excited to read a review of this book...although the plot was interesting the overall book was disappointing. The translation was poor at best...a spell checker is not a substitute for a real human. My favorite was ""foible"" for foil. Touche!"
2,What a huge disappointment,"I'm surprised by these glowing reviews. I've been a huge fan since FLANDERS PANEL but this new one is suspect. The mystery is entirely predictable, and lasts only a hundred pages. The villainess is stereotypic (a sexy, husky-voiced, athletic, dark-eyed vixen who was molded/manipulated by an older man in her youth) and any other supporting cast of any interest is non-existent. And Don Jaime is a pathetically transparent, clueless, and utterly unlikeable character. It's one thing to have a protagonist who's faulted, another to have a bumbling, clueless idiot.I dearly hope Mr. Reverte is not thinking he can blueprint the rest of his mysteries, giving it a hook that readers will think is 'cool' -- chess, books, religion, fencing -- and plastering mediocre plotting around it. However, judging from the feelings below, he can, which is too bad, because he's far too talented for that."
2,The Fencing Master,This was not the best book by this author that I have read. The characters were on the boring side and I had to push myself to finish.
5,Torture Story,Die for Me is a torture story. They killed women as young a 12 years of age. After Charles Ng was arrested he began to torture women. Leonard Lake met Charles Ng and they worked together to kill and torture women. They found 6 bodies buried with a sack of bones at Charles Ng's bunker. They also found a baby's liver. When Charles Ng was arrested he committed murder. Lake was put to death in prison.
3,Hard to obtain book for someone interested in military history,"This is a specialist book - if you're interested in Australia's navy history, it's a must have. If not, it's not for you."
5,Excellent collection of short stories,What a great book of short stories. I find myself feeling the lives of each short story.
2,I AM A BIG ABBA FAN!..& I am not too thrilled with this CD,"I have been a Abba fan for many years and was not too happy with this CD. The only worthy tracks are the ones by Erasure, Banarama, Information Society and especially the one orginal member Frida did of Dancing Queen (probably the last we'll hear a orginal member of Abba sing one of their hits since they broke up) I guess I'm very protective of Abba's music and I think it is flawless and should be not be touched..they'll never be anyone who'll be able to top the orginal recordings. All I want is for Abba to get back together for one night and do a live concert and release it on Cd just once please I beg of you if any members are out there reading this...do something similar to Fleetwood Mac's The Dance, which had glorious results..."
5,BUY NOW!!!,"This music is far too spiritually moving to pass up. From the unaccompanied choir to the chromatic climax of the orchestra, this album is a shining example of why Mr. Part is at the top of my list of modern composers."
3,More part than whole,Some stunningly sacred sections but nothing that conceptually justifies full commitment.
2,Slingback - not true size,I like Naturalizer shoes and sandels and most times they are very true to size. I order this shoe a size wider and it was still too narrow.
3,Beula Jean Where Are You?,I am glad to see that I am not crazy. I have been looking for the album with Beula Jean on it for the last 10 years. Someone never returned my all. I have been heart sick ever since.Camille
5,must read,funniest book ever. plain and simple. buy it and read it. (not reccommended for femenists!)
5,Simply Amazing,"I've been reading maddox for years, he has great verbal work and sure he'll lighten up your day.This book will change the way you see life. It has historical significance and shoud definitely placed it on your book shelf right next to The Bible.Great Work."
5,Classic Maddox Gold,"Part male fact, part sexist jokes (in my opinion) and part Raw Maddox rants.I doubt I can add any more positive feedback that hasn't been said, but if you want an indicator to how good it is, I bought a 2nd copy for my friend to read and share around."
4,Don't buy for your husband. Heh...,"I bought this book as a surprise for my husband since he and I really enjoy the writings on Maddox's website. Boy, did I open a can of worms. Now the hubby is driving me nuts with all of the ""suggestions"" in the book. He was literally laughing his head off then insisted on reading it to me while pointing things out and asking stupid questions. This book will piss many women off unless you have a really good sense of humor. The illustrations are hilarious though. Actually this book shouldn't be bought for anyone - it might create a monster. Don't say I didn't warn you!"
2,Dumbed down,"The author's website - [...] - is much funnier than this book. The illustrations do not work with the content as well as the rough, DIY style graphics on Maddox's website. The illustrations in the book are way too literal, dumbing down the potential. The book really comes off overall as an attempt to make the author's novel humor palatable to a mass audience."
5,Douchebags (not) wanted,"This book is similar to being tea-bagged by members of Hugh Hefner arm-candy; You'll be wildly entertained the whole time and when it's over, you'll be left with a warm, tingly sensation in your testicles. This book is not for the metrosexual (gay) and female rights advocates among us but, rather, hearkens back to a time when being a chauvinistic prick was considered an endearing quality in a man. However, a word of warning: if you enter this reading endeavor with the intent of finding a serious read your colon will explode in a fiery ball of pirate semen...and that's a hard one to explain to the ER staff."
3,I never read it.,I bought it. The hype. I never read it because I spend all my time on the internet... what is a book?
1,Waste of time and money,I think this video is just a waste of time and money of the consumers. All it show is a few people talking and then a few couples having the most basic and boring sexual intercourse. I wouldn't buy these kinds of video again.
4,Good product,"I used them for repairing a broken cabinet base while the glue was setting to take some of the pressure off the screws and to hold single pieces of lumber and 1 1/4"" dowels that were a little unwieldy to cut on a table saw. Not what I would consider heavy-duty, but they do the job well for lighter projects (as expected .. it says ""mini"" in the name)."
3,BANDslam,"I can hardly believe it myself, but I've now seen three - three! - Vanessa Hudgens movies. I fear I'm actually beginning to find her attractive, which is a pretty frightening thought."
2,movie,The movie itself is a good enough show but i was dissapointed it did not have a proper case. it must have said that in the add but i missed it. thanks.
4,Good family movie,Romance and music go together. Fun family movie for all ages. I recommend this movie for your viewing pleasure. It is well worth your time.
4,Better than the Stanley product,"I originally bought a Stanley precision mitre box and saw, but that product came with parts missing and the pieces would not fasten correctly. I traded the Stanley product for this Jorgensen product, and the Jorgensen mitre box & saw is MUCH better made than the Stanley. It has less slop in the saw bracket, and the clamping system works much better on this product than the Stanley product; it holds the work down very tightly without so much as a smudge. I use it to make joints in my oak art frames (oak is very hard wood), and with this saw I can make perfect cuts every time. But don't expect to use this saw the same way you would use a carpenter's saw; this is made for fine precision work, not ripping joists or wall studs, so it requires a different technique. If you're willing to learn how to use it properly, it will serve you well."
5,New Christy Minstrels - Golden Classics Edition,"I have had Ramblin on vinyl since it came out and was greatly pleased to find it on CD. The second album, Today, was equally good. The usual great stuff by Barry McGuire and Co."
3,Be Careful,"I bought the original video of Sleepy Hallow like mines but its very delicate, my VHS player isn't gentle anymore so it almost broke this one too, it is an old copy too because its the exact same one as mines that broke, I'd try looking for a DVD copy since VHS are out of style pretty much, but I got it for a steal."
5,Cute & Comfy - Runs Big,"We ordered these skates for my 9 year old daughter after not finding much selection in stores where we live. These are a classic roller rink skate and are well made. I love the vintage old school look, and my daughter just lit up when we took them out of the box. Keep in mind when ordering that these run really big - at least a full size larger. My daughter normally wears a 3/4 in girls shoes so we ordered the 4, but these def are a full size larger. This will be ok as she can grow into them, but for now she puts on two pairs of cushy socks to fill the gap. I wear a womens size 6, and these were too big even for me. Another reviewer said these run true to size, so maybe it just depends. My daughter says these are comfortable, and she loves having her own skates when we go to the rink. These seem to be holding up well, and are definitely a good buy, especially with free shipping."
4,"very nice, my daughter loves them.","Great first pair of skates for my daughter, they function well, the boot fits well and is comfortable, a good starter pair to make sure your kid will stick with it."
1,Cannot make program work satisfactorily and no support,"I purchased my copy directly from McAfee. In attempting to build a database to identify unnecessary files, it hangs the computer and QuickClean must be stopped using CTRL/ALT/Delete. I attempted to access support online and was informed that support was not available for this product. I located the support forum and posed a question, describing the problem. Nearly three weeks later, a McAfee rep replied with some suggestions that did not work. While I have been a satisfied McAfee Anti-Virus customer, my experience with QuickClean 6.0 is so disappointing that I don't think I would gamble on any other McAfee products."
5,This Program Works Very Well,"This program not only works very well, is very through, it is also easy to use.On the other hand, you might be able to download a disk cleaner that meets your needs for free. Try Goggling one up."
5,Way Tight,"This joint going be hella tight. He can't sing but his beats be way tight. And he got tight songs, so I got every No Limit Cd the first day it came out since December 15 (Mystikal)."
1,Figures everone else likes it.,"If Mo B Dick was some new guy on a no name record lable you would all say this CD is trash, but since hes with No Limit you kiss his butt just like everyone else. Simple he cant sing, produce, flow, nuthin. Worst No Limit CD yet right behind Prime suspects, Big Ed, Ghetto Commission, and Mr. Serv-on. Dont waist your money on this junk, I rather listen Nate Dogg and that stink too, No Limit is not tight anymore and should take time off some releasing new artist every week. >=("
4,Unspoken Words,"Unspoken words moved my spirit and was soothing to my soul. I believe Hiko has tapped a deep connection that has helped me to experience the energy that passes from my head to my heart to my gut in a new and more synchronized way. Thank You, HIKO peace, Peter G."
4,Good economics book,"Some books have too much needless pages just only to get thicker book, but this has no fluffy at all. 600+ pages simply stickt business and no repetition of self-evident things."
3,Missing a crucial song,"This cd would've been perfect if The Collectables lable woul've included ""Good Friends And Fireplaces which was on the original Stop and smell the roses album and also on the first edition of this cd Columbia label reissued in 1990 which is now out of print. Good Friends and Fireplaces was one of the best songs from the album besides one hell of a woman,the title song,and A poor man's gold. Good friends and fireplaces should've been included on this compilation and only give this 3 stars for the companies negligence to do so."
3,Reeks of 70's,"I really like Mac Davis.I really wanted to love this CD.It's just OK.The song choices and production are clearly 70's slick.""Baby Don't Get Hooked On Me"" and ""Texas In My Rearview Window"" are very good songs and I like them but I was hoping for some hidden gems."
4,MORE THAN YOU KNOW,"YES THE PRODUCT DOES CONTAIN:HC Blue 2HC Yellow 5HC Red 3HC Yellow 2HC Yellow 4HC Red 1Disperse Violet 1HC Violet 14 DDisperse BlackBUT YOU MAY COMPARE IT TO FOOD COLORING BUT FOR THE HAIR.THEY USE THE MILDEST DYE OF ALL DYES IN THE PRODUCT.WOMAN WHO ARE PREGNANT, OR HAVE SENSITIVE SCALP OR ARE ALLERGICTO SPECIFIC ELEMENTS ARE STILL ABLE TO USE THE PRODUCT.CREAM: MORE OF A DEEP CONDITIONING TREATMENT (LASTS UP TO 7-10 SHAMPOO WASHES)POWDER: MORE FOR COLOR (LAST UP TO 20-30 SHAMOO WASHES)FOR BETTER RESULTS - LEAVE IT IN A LITTLE MORE LONGER - ABOUT 20-30 MIN MORE"
3,Disappointed:(,"I was really excited to get this product...When I first put it in my hair it was very bright and beautiful, but it washes out and the color is almost gone out."
2,not that great,"I bough this product because i have developed allergies to regular hair color in the market i was looking for something natural. However, this product is not natural and contains many chemicals."
3,Cabelos jovens !,"O produto e bom e facil de usar , qualquer pessoa em casa pode aplicar . A unica coisa que nao gostei e que a tinta nao tem uma durabilidade maior para com os fios brancos do cabelo . Eu recomendo as pessoas que nao tem fios do cabelo branco ."
5,"A great, natural product.","For safety, convenience, ease-of-use, and for how well it works, I recommend this product. I have used several chemical hair color preparations and have been turned off by the odors and by the way they had left my hair dry and brittle, and often had ""unnatural"" color effects which took a while to wash out. I switched to powder henna, but found, although natural-looking and smelling, it could be messy to prepare and apply, and also can take a long time before reaching the desired color effect. This product is very simple to use, with less mess and fuss, smells lovely, and leaves the hair in good condition. A super alternative!"
2,Won't stay in,"It is a great product!, I love everything about it except the fact that it last no more than a week!, it washes out very quickly, I want something that will stay in my hair longer. It could be the color, because red always washes out fast. Besides that I loved it, great smell, it leaves your hair feeling incredible, it's good for your hair unlike the other hair coloring products."
2,A few good sections...,"This book has a number of good sections, but the majority of the book is really stupid. It has a really good section for job interview preparation, and it gives a good idea of workplace politics. The technical knowledge from this book is not useful whatsoever. I did not find it to be funny, it was actually really embarrassing to be reading a book with random pictures such as an open pizza box, or the guy's wife with a rolling pin about to smash an oscilloscope."
2,Not that good..........,If you have had ANY sex outside of the missionary position - this is not the movie for you. We found it very boring. Nothing we hadn't tried before (and we are not THAT adventurous). And... the actors... hello?? Could they at least be attractive and not keep showing the guys hairy butt!!!
2,quality is not good,"I was very disappointed with the quality of the dvd. I believe it may have some good info, but it was too hard to watch with all the skipping, hanging and fuzziness."
5,eros is an italian legend who songs spand globally,"I first heard Eros Ramazzotti on a cd with Andrea Bocelli. His voice was warm and soulful. After hearing that song ""nel cuore lei"", I went out and bought his cd's one after the other. Stilelibero is by far my favorite. It has so much personality and alot of Eros's past and present talents go into it. I loved L'ombra Del Gigante and Fuoco Nel Fuoco so much!!! But it's hard to say which is my favorite because I love them all. If I had to pick one, it probably would be Piu che Puoi!!!!! Also, I get to hear him sing in English a little which made my heart soar! I am an avid fan of Eros Ramazzotti and am waiting for him to come to the USA in 2002 so I can be in the front row. I will dream until then among his music that I listen to everyday. I also can't wait for his DVD which is set to come out in February 2002. Of course I will buy it here when they get it.Sincerely,Lauraciao"
5,Eros ahhh music to my ears,"Have you ever been walking along and heard a sound that perks up your ears, thinking whats that great sound or I could listen to that for hours. Well thats what I think of Eros. He has a very unique voice that makes his love ballards (and other songs) sound all that much better. You can't compare Eros to any other Italian male artist as Eros is trully one of a kind.Happy Listening - He is well worth the buy!"
5,Eros just gained a fan!,"I have to admit, I have never been a big Eros fan. I happened to listen to some sound clips of this cd before I went out and bought it, and it really caught my attention! These songs have a lot of quality to them. They are very nice comtemporary rock songs. ""Fuoco Nel Fuoco"", the first single has a great beat! All my friends love the song, even though they can't understand it. I have to say, my favorites have to be ""Piu Che Puoi"" the duet with Cher, ""E Ancor Mi Chiedo"" and ""Per Me Per Sempre""... I'm a sucker for ballads. I recommend this CD to anyone thinking about buying it."
3,Deming Does not Equal TQM,"In my quick read of sections of this book on amazon, I was not able to see the author's comments about Dr. Deming and TQM on page 191. While Deming was linked to the Quality movement and coached the Japanese to focus on quality if they wanted to become a global competitor, he often said ""TQM--what is it? I never heard of it."" Deming taught a philosophy of management and leadership. He taught nations and organizations how to transform--exactly what we need today! Transformation may become another buzzword like ""change management."" But those who learn and apply transformation based on a solid theoretical framework can transform and innovate. Fads are playing havoc with our organizations today. That it why it is so imperative to find leaders who think, create and design systems, and keep learning and adapting. That takes courage. [...]"
2,It was just okay...,"This book was a very interesting way of looking at relationships. I had a hard time reading the entire book because about half way through, it suggested that I change who I am to be more like the guy I wanted to fall in love with me. I am just not willing to change myself that much, so I don't think that I was a very good candidate for the book. I had a difficult time believing that it is morally correct to make someone fall in love with you when you are not acting completely like yourself. After reading this book you may spend more time focusing on all of its rules then actually getting to know the guy. I do think that it is an interesting read but try not to hang on its every word."
5,"So much better than ""The Rules""!","this techniques outlined in this book are an excellent way to find a good man and still be yourself! you learn how to talk to a guy in a way he can understand and relate to, then you can talk to him about anything! in ""The Rules"" they basically say you can't talk to him at all, and that's wrong. if you follow the techniques in this book you are on your way to finding someone who you can be yourself with and have a good relationship."
3,Insightful But A Bit Gradiose In Its Claims,"There are many important concepts about the difference in communication styles between men & women. But some of the ""trying to read his mind"" segments were a bit silly and unbelievable. I love her idea about making a list describing the ideal man & then keeping yourself on track by only dating men who resemble your ideal, so that you don't waste time with incompatible losers."
4,Agree with 4 out 5 reviewer,"I agree with the reviewer that said 4 out of 5 stars, and with his review. Have this to say about the 1 out of 5 star review. I have this case, has never scratched my PSP. Perhaps it was user error, keep in mind they didn't mention where the scratch was, nor how the scratch got there. This is the slimest case I have found for the PSP for when you want to protect the PSP, put it in a jacket pocket, and not carry it around in a gigantic case like most out there. This case is much like the metal cases that have been made for PDA's of which I have 2. I would recommend this product if, you want a slim case that protects and does nothing more. For example no space for extra memory cards, or extra battery life as other cases provide, but at the sametime no extra bulk either."
5,new commode,Had to replace a very old commode for my 94 year old mom. She really likes this one. She actually uses it as an extra chair and sits on the closed lid while she dresses and puts on her shoes.(She's a real lightweight!)It is sturdy and she likes the style. It was a good choice.
1,It is not original,"Eric's new album sounds a lot like Rahassan Patterson's album; hence, Eric needs to go back to the drawing board and find his True Self (in his words), plus, maybe add a little umph to his style...but that could be hard because acts like Maxwell, who have become the true performers of today, not saying Eric isn't okay, but performers like that have already made a name for themselves, and those that come afterward, with generally the same style, may not ever be taken seriously. In addition, Eric aahs too much in his music, maybe he's better in concert, but can he show his stuff on album, because not everyone can make it to a concert..."
2,Redundancy!,Eric Benet's second album sounds quite redundant...it seems every song is in the same key (probably not...but it sounds like it) He would give me a headache...it's not something I can really jam to or soothe to...He needs more personality and a little more appeal...the bare feet won't do it!...he definately is not on the status of a Maxwell or D'Angelo...he's second tier! He does need Help from Halle!
2,No.No.No.,Why listen to this stevie wonder wannabe when you can listen to the real thing. his sexual lingo is just plain embarressing.
4,Fabulous!!,This is my favorite Eric Benet CD. Just put this in and push Play. Excellent from start to finish. Come As You Are is absolutely one of his best songs.
1,Piece of junk,"The middle screw has come loose on more than one occasion. Unless you'd like to see you or the one you are buying it for get seriously hurt, get something else."
4,One of life's little pleasures...,This is a well-made item that will make life easier for me. Light to move and even has 4 indentations underneath on all sides that act as handles making it easier to grab and move. Many uses including drying off after shower...gives you a place to sit. Great price now!
5,Big help,I bought this and my niece assembled it for me. I feel so safe not having to stand in the bathtub and possibly falling down and hurting myself.
3,Okay for short term use,"This stool is an inexpensive option if you do not need a long term item. I needed this for 3 weeks after surgery. It did it's job, but by week 3 I had to keep tightening the screws. Good if you do not want to spend a lot of money and need temporary seating in the shower."
1,Carex round shower stool,"I hesitate to send a review. The stool was exactly as promised and came early. It fit into the tub fine. However our family member is not steady enough on his feet to be able to balance on it for a tub shower. So the item is fine, well made. BUT sadly it did not fit our requirements."
3,Lost me on the 4th green,"So, I'm not a golfer - never had the urge or the scratch to learn - maybe that's why I didn't love this book. What made me pick it up was the title - I mean, what the heck is a Money-Whipped Steer-Job Three Jack Give-Up Artist anyway? I won't spoil it for you. If you are a golfer, you probably already know. If not, be prepared for a rather bumpy ride through the world of professional golf where the egos are as large as Wall Street and the ability to win or lose in a few seconds is just about the same. But I just couldn't cut it."
2,Disappointment,"Dan Jenkins' new book...""Steer Job et al"" was a major disappointment to me. The book was a slow starter, picked up pace early on and then ground to a halt.....It is basically a re-write of ""Dead Solid Perfect"" with a dash of golf History. Jenkins characters are slightly more urbane (hard to use that word on denizens of Ft. Worth Tx.)than those is ""Dead Solid"", however far less colorful. I have read every one of Jenkins' books and they usually have me rolling in the aisles, laughing so hard I have tears in my eyes. This book appears to be a rehash of some of his earlier ""observations""...."
5,THE WAY OF PEACE,THIS IS A EXCELLENT BOOK ON PRAY AND MEDITATION BY ONE OF THE EARLY AUTHOR JAMES ALLEN FOR ME IT IS A VERY HEAVY BOOK MEANING I CAN ONLY DIGEST A FEW PAGE AT A TIME. IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE YOU MEDITATION THIS IS ONE BOOK YOU SHOULD HAVE. EXCELLENT FIVE STARS
3,Three Merry Widows,"Trippy psychedelic masterpiece with the lead singer obviously possessed by the voice of Janis Joplin. Saw the Three Merry Widows at the Ranch Bowl in Omaha, Ne open up for the Connells. When they opened up the show no one knew what to expect from this unknown band and they blew the doors off the place with their raw sound and Alice captured and carried the audience to another plane with her voice. I bought their CD the next day and then never saw or heard from them again. If anyone knows what happend to this band please post a review."
1,Bad book,I had to use this text in college and it was the worst book in four years of study. If you want a long boring explanation of thermodynamics choose this book. I can not in any way recommend this book. See Moran or Ceagel or JP Holman much better books.
4,History Made Interesting,"Although writing nonfiction history in an interesting way is difficult, David Halberstam has succeeded here. The amount of research that he did is obviously overwhelmingly large, and he assembles the facts of the events as they happened in such a way that I felt as though I had indeed lived through the Fifties. I liked how each chapter dealt with a different event; this helped me focus my attention more efficiently and keep some of the names straight. I also liked the selection of topics; they seemed varied and comprehensive. Even though certain political stories do have a slant to them, I feel that the wealth and breadth of knowledge makes this book a valuble read for baby boomers and younger folks alike."
2,Madness ( Vacanze per un massacro ),"This is a B movie that I give a D to. It was shot on a really cheap budget, the scene when the woman is attacked is not that violent or exploitational. The girl is basically ready and willing. This movie might be worth a watch, but not a buy, I wish I could have found a way to rent it then I wouldn't have bought it. Also it's in Italian with no subtitles."
5,Good Video for Intimate Massage,"This video is not perfect but was well done for its intended purpose. It works best to use the main menu to choose the selections you are interested in. If you watch it several times you will easily remember the techniques and how to use them. I tried the massage techniques on my partner several times and they absolutely loved it and found it to be very relaxing, yet arrousing and pleasurable.This video contains nudity and orgasm but is in no way anything like typical pornography. Instead, it is tasteful and instructional. It can be a vey good tool to help sexual partners find new ways to please each other."
4,Kaleidoscopic inspiration!,"If I was requested for the most experimental work of Al Di Meola, this would be my first choice. This gifted artist made a true kaleidoscopic album pregnant of livings and memories. That explains its cosmopolitan feature; every track is a stage by itself.In my mother' s eyes accuses the eternal debt of all musician respect the Brazilian moods. It is absolutely undeniable the boss a nova taste, which is blended with clever innovations. But there is still more.Vizzini is a personal tribute to the famous Venetian painter. The infinite desire would seem to be thought in Astor Piazzolla.So in this sense I do not have any doubt to recommend you; keeping in mind this advertence's clause."
5,Outstanding and Heart Felt,"As a graduate of Marshall University and a life long resident of West Virginia, I was only 4 years old when this horrible accident took place. My father was on the scene and relived the memories throughout his life. The film is a inspiration to all who believe in overcoming obstacles."
1,this book is weak,if you've ever read a good book about programming you will be disappointed. I've read a polish transaltion of this book and it is even worse than in english. The best thing is that author lies in this book (about Java e.g.) and says that that this is his book so he can do it. I think that if it is his book i will send it back to him.
4,Good overview of .NET,"I wish you could give other reviewers stars. I really wonder about the people that bash a book because it wasn't what they thought it would be. Where they perhaps thinking that in 200 pages in a book self proclaimed as an INTRODUCTION would provide them with the indepth coverage they were looking for on .NET?I don't see why a book should loose stars because the person buying the book can't read the title of the book.I bought this book and gave it to our sales manager and training manager and now they can at least talk .NET with clients. I also recommend this book to my students who are looking to just get into .NET, and they all really enjoy this book and start to see why .NET is pretty cool.The Java bashing (while fun) is a little off though, so minus 1 star."
2,Nothing new here,"If this book was released when .NET was annouced in July 2000, or if I had just wandered into town after being lost in the woods for a year, I might have given it 5 stars.As a developer who has been digging into .NET and writting C# code for several months, this book was a waste of time.If you don't know what .NET is about and not interested in digging into code, then this book is your best bet for getting up to speed quickly."
3,Good Reissue,"This is a nice Re-Release of thier first MGM album, glad to have it now on CD! The original stereo album was mastered ""flat"" with no bass at all, this CD was a big improvement in sound quality.My only gripe is there was plenty of room on the CD to add the band's second (and better IMO) album, ""EVERY MOTHERS SON-BACK"". Instead we get two of the weaker songs from that album plus a OK non-album cut."
5,Curl Up With It,"Suzanne Rodriguez brings 1920s Pairs to life in the pages of Wild Heart; A Life. If you like biographies, European history, Paris, or are Natalie Barney fan, this is the book for you. To be honest, even if you have never heard of Natalie Barney, it's still a great read. As a writer, I found the accounts of Ms. Barney's famous ""Fridays"" (her Paris salon) very intriguing. Oh, what a treat it would be to go back in time and attend just one!! Ms. Rodriguez makes you feel like you are there, with vivid descriptions about the interpersonal interactions of some of the more famous (and infamous) Friday attendees.Ms. Rodriguez is a first-rate biographer, as she lets her subject's life gracefully unfold, rather than pushing it on the reader. She also interjects interesting historical tid-bits and she has a way of subtly adding her own personality to the tome.Buy it, curl up and escape! It's a great read."
2,clamp jammed,"Always favored Bessey clamps over all the others I have, but one that I used maybe twice jamed so that it will not move up and down the bar. I called the 800 number and was told in essance that I had to send the clamp back to the factory for evaluation and if they found that it was not defective it would be returned. Being that the clamp was less than 6 months old I asked if they could send me a new one and I would return the defective one to them. They said 'no'. Just seems like poor customer service to me."
5,Great Skate!,The skates were a good fit and comfortable. The first time I wore them out they felt great and had good grip on the floor. I would recomment these to any skate enthusiast.
4,Well Pleased,"I wanted a way to get some exercise outdoors & have fun at the same time. I decided to try roller skating, which I haven't done since I was a kid (I'm 62). I didn't want to spend a lot of money since I wasn't sure how well this would work for me.In searching for inexpensive, good for outdoors, and 4 wheels as opposed to inlines, I was led to these skates. I ordered, they arrived promptly, and as were advertised.I didn't give 5 stars as I wish the toe stops were of a more durable material. The asphalt & concrete are chewing them up pretty quickly. I'm going to have to replace them very soon. Maybe as my skating improves I won't chew them up so much. But I am having fun!"
5,Awesome Skates,"I'm so glad that I bought these skates, they're awesome! The fit is a bit big, so buy your exact size, not the half size up (you know ladies how some of us do when we buy online, just to be safe), or like in my case just wear thick socks and tie the laces tight. They roll and glide so well, which helps since I haven't roller skated in over 20 years. I'm so glad that I didn't go and buy the $200+ skates they sell at the novelty shops :-D"
1,Pure Garage,"These skates are bottom of the barrel, trick you into reliving your childhood purchase.They are VERY narrow and put together pretty cheaply.Just a heads up to people buying:They wheels dont turn well because the bearings are the crappiest and cheapest and slowest you can get. You can loosen and oil all day long and you will still feel slow.i hate chicago and rollerblade brands. total gimmicks."
3,Size mishap,"I ordered a size 9 and received a size 6. Needless to say I was disappointed but I daughter was happy as she wears a size 6 lol. I see where the error was made on the box, ordered it again and hoping for a 9."
4,Good skate for beginning skaters!,"I got these skates for my daughter-in-law who is just learning to roller skate. It's great for someone who is learning, the boot and chassis are really nice but if you know how to skate, you will need to upgrade the wheels and bearings. They do not roll easily or with any speed so if you can skate well, better wheels and bearings are a must. Also, these skates do run large so the reviews are correct in suggesting that you order a size smaller if you wear a whole size normally or if you are a half size, order the whole size lower ( for a 5 1/2 order the 5).All in all a great pair of starter skates!"
4,Skates Review,"Great skates! Just make sure you order a size down, they run really big, but good skates for the price!"
3,Bobby kinda comes up short,"These songs are chestnuts from the great American Songbook, but Bobby sounds tired here. The backup band is stellar though. Not a great intro for the Mr Short novice, but a collector might like it."
1,Mediocre documentary,"I was really looking forward to this documentary especially since the one review that it has was 5 stars, however, it begins with a very low budget scene that does not relate to the documentary very well. The documentary was of an average quality -- nothing really new within the interviews. I believe that their was a lot of potential for this documentary since it is based on such an interesting subject, however, the documentary falls very short and does not provide any significant speakers or statements."
2,"Yes, Logic is made easy","This book achieved its goal- it made logic easy.. because it does not have much to say. One won't have trouble digesting such little material.I think this book is for students who needs basic logic 101. It doesn't cover a lot really.If you want your money's worth, there are some good blogs on the internet(they are free). Just Google."
3,"Good, but not for LSAT study","This book has great information for those in philosophy classes that are analyzing arguments, or just for general knowledge. I wanted to learn more so that I could better understand the LSAT. There were small portions that addressed this, but there is not enough to accomplish my purpose for reading."
4,"Sturdy construction, quick to use",Clamps and un-clamps quickly. Great for carpentry/furniture building projects. Has a strong clamping power without feeling like I am going to twist the wood handle off.
3,Barely interesting,"This is a 44 page booklet with photos written by a Navy Commander who served as Flag Lieutenant to Admiral Nimitz for four and one half years. It contains some mildly interesting anecdotes but no real insight into the Admiral. Disappointing, considering how long and in what such close contact the author was with the Admiral. Worth a read by an avid WW2 amateur historian but not worth purchasing. This is a pamphlet published and made available by the Admiral Nimitz Foundation in Fredericksburg, Texas."
5,awesome product,"got this for my mother after she had knee replacement surgery and she loves it, it's very sturdy and easy for her to use. it was very easy to assemble"
3,Shower Chair,"The chair works great but like most normal bathtubs, the chair is a little to wide. Other than that it's great."
3,WOW!!,The movie was ok it build you up then just ended your like what happen like there should have been more to it
4,"You've done it again, McCain","""Machine Gun McCain"" is the thinking person's gangster movie. Perhaps it is John Cassavetes' brooding performance that brings this edge to director Giuliano Mondaldo's thrilling film. Peter Falk is no sympathetic Columbo here and it's great to see Gena Rowlands in a cameo that is the best performance in the film. You will remember Gena long after the closing credits. Montaldo knows how to make films like this and this is one of his best. The climax is a bottler. Ennio Morricone's score is a major asset, as always."
4,nice footstool,"this is a nice footstool - fairly sturdy - paint job on the legs looks average at best ( mine has paint missing on the legs ) - i thought it was going to be alittle bit bigger - but i misread the measurements. all in all for the price i can't complain to much - if the legs were painted the right way i would have considered giving this footstool 5 stars. it is also very easy to put together. just to update my review- the footstool broke after about 3 weeks, i called and emailed the company and they refunded my money with no problem at all. i want to thank the company for acting so quickly and also amazon.com reps for all their help in this matter ( they provided me with the phone number and email address ) - this may have just been a defective footstool so i don't want to discourage anyone from purchasing it. thank you."
1,Junk,"I read the reviews and thought it was cheap, but I'm not expecting much. Well, it's not worth the money spent. I've had it for a month, it's now broken. I only used it as a foot stool under my desk. It STINKS! I let it air out for a week - it did nothing! I was going to sand it down and repaint it is that bad. But, now that it is broken I'm actually happy. I have a reason to throw it out and buy a better foot stool. Save your money and your nose. Don't get."
5,Great classic rock,"It is sad that no uses organs anymore. Sugarloaf had a great distinctive sound. ""Tongue and Cheek"" is by far there greatest song. It deserves to air play on the radio. I was really glad to be able to get this on CD. I have the vinyl of both but not having a CD recorder I was limited on listening to them. It is great to be able to listen in my car."
3,Tim,"Sugarloaf was an innovative but spotty group. Their debut album, with ""Green Eyed Lady"", was a bit loosy-goosy. Some good songs, but other cuts degenerated into rambling jam sessions.Then came Spaceship Earth, with some interesting innovations: (1) the whole album had a theme, and (2) it was an early, rare example of guitars and keyboards playing leads in stacked harmony (title song is a good example). The music was tight, well written, and if you were lucky enough to see them in concert that year, extremely well performed.After Spaceship Earth, they were never quite the same. In fact, I saw them in concert in 1974. Their material relied on self-indulgent jams and way too much commentary about their heavy use of illegal flora.Buy this two-album pack and you get listen to the development of this talented but shortlived 70s group. It's worth the 13 bucks just to listen to that B-3 organ belt out the opening riff of ""Spaceship Earth""."
1,Cliche overly dramatic take on financial meltdown. Inside Job was much better.,"Slow moving, hackneyed film. I saw Inside Job and i thought this might be interesting. I want my two hours back Inside Job, a documentary, is easier to understand and more entertaining. Plus, Zachary Quinto's caterpillar brows are hypnotizing in a bad way."
1,This could have been a good movie.,"Great concept, very good cast.. timely story.. but I couldn't get through it.It's strange.. some movies have lots of foul language and other heavy content, yet are still very good. For example, Quentin Tarantino can write a script loaded with profanity, yet the script is still brilliant.But, in other cases, lots of profanity just seems like very lazy writing. It is extremely easy to fill a script with almost nothing but four-letter words.Such is the case here. A zillion f-bombs within the first half hour. Practically nothing else being said. That's it, I'm done. This could have been a good movie."
1,What hollywood thinks finance is like,"As someone who works in finance, I can tell you that this movie is just retarded. It's filled with typical liberal quips about ""making too much money"" (oddly they don't talk about how much Stephen Spielberg or Johnny Depp make). It also has a nonsensical diatribe where one of the characters talks about how he ""made a bridge"" and it helps so many people. He obviously doesn't talk about where the financing came to make the bridge. Another typical liberal jab that infrastructure spending is selfless and noble but managing capital markets is ignoble. I'm amazed this movie has such good reviews but, considering the average American can complete 16+ years of education without having taken a single finance or accounting class in either K-12 or in 4 years of college, I'm not exactly surprised."
3,Excuse me,"Interesting movie about how people justify their unethical behavior, excuse themselves by claiming they had no choice while ruining other people's lives (and blaming the victims for it). That's right, its another movie about Wall Street and apparently nothing's changed!"
3,great totally 100% fictional drama about wall street office goings-on,"Alas some folks wanted a factual, non-fictional treatment about the recent Wall Street hedge fund fiascos and then gave this serviceable flick one star.But isnt that was a documentary is supposed to do?What we do get is an interesting slow-burn of an office drama with some minor plot twists along the way. Realistic? Nope not even a little. Rather enjoyable if you like talky dramas? Yes.There's some subtleties and ironies offered along the way that some will miss."
4,"Interesting view, great acting","The stories of the melt down have been told a lot of times and this is another view from the inside. It is not an action flick as you would normally think of an action flick - but if you like behind the scenes maneuvering, watching people stop on each other to get what they want, and how easy decisions like these get made, then you will like this film.90% of the time there are just 2 people on the screen. The movie explores the different emotions and relationships between all levels of employees and economic classes.The cast is amazing. I could have watched each role even longer."
1,awful movie,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'd say even Boiler Room is better. Also, the male actors are so ugly: and I expected eventually a gay sex scene with the two gay-looking young floor traders, but nothing sexual in this movie. Also, it's basically a cigarette and alcohol commercial, with non-stop ""tough"" foul language."
3,Decent movie.,"Enjoyed the movie because I enjoy movies about the markets. I thought the short quips about this and that could have been enhanced, but were probably done that way because of budget constraints. The end dialogue between Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons was instructive. Overall, I rate the movie a three. I had to strain to hear the muted and mumbled dialogue. The most exciting part where an actor spoke up is when they fired people. Typical American conduct. We have a weird fetish about firing people in our great country."
5,Amazing,This movie is amazing and is well balanced between Wall Street and Main Street. The movie does not take one side or the other but presents the perspectives of both.
2,Gives Jesus the F word as a middle name,This looked to be a good movie but when they clean up the floor with the Lord's name it is all over for me. Had to shut it off. Shame on this production company.
1,WTF???,"Horribly stupid interpretation of what happened! Boring, poorly acted and droll story! Save your money...more importantly, SAVE YOUR TIME!!! Pathetic!"
2,Just O.K.,The story wasn't well written. Kept expecting more and it never happened. There should have been more explanation on what was actually happening. The acting was just average. Movie was disappointing.
2,Very bad Cinematography,"This film was shot on video, and it really shows! It felt like a youtube project that was thrown together in a few weeks (cheap lighting, jerky camera, soap opera look). I expect more from the visuals especially when top name actors are involved. Also this film was not the least bit a thriller. It's a drama, and the acting was quite decent (espcially Spacey), but the presenation was very amateurish."
2,Nauseating.,I gave this movie two stars because it is well crafted and finely acted. However the story is awful. In it we hear detailed arguments why we should accept corrupt and destructive business practices. The decent characters in the story make a few weak protests and then just give in. By the end of the film I felt sick.
2,Not what was expected,"Given all that's happened in the financial world, especially Wall Street, I expected a bigger, more complex plot. Even the trailer is misleading. This is a very small story, dealing with one event at one firm. Surely as a stage play, this would be very good. The firm seems to be modeled on a number of financial firms, it has elements of many. Simon Baker's resemblance to Jamie Dimon is uncanny, as I'm sure other of the cast members are based on real people. Disappointing film, especially the ending."
5,Powerfully austere,"If you have business experience and already understand what caused the financial meltdown, you're likely to enjoy this movie. Rather than getting into a lot of technical details about the financial aspects, it depicts the kind of Wall Street people who were involved and what they were thinking and doing when they first realized they had a massive bursting bubble on their hands (and books). We see that they're people who are, for the most part, highly paid to the extent of taking their incomes for granted, coldly calculating, and lacking a moral compass. In the end, it's about putting their personal interest above that of others, regardless of who might be harmed, provided that no laws are apparently being broken.Personally, I found this movie gripping. Through great acting and story, and without over the top gimmicks, it maintains an austere tension which is almost understated yet very powerful. And Jeremy Irons is particularly mesmerizing in his role as CEO."
4,Good job,"Good movie that holds you..beginning to end.Spacey is great...Baker is awesome....Demi is great as the ""bitch"" ceo type!The beginning of the end of the 2008 mess on Wall Street!!!!I wish they had done another half hour to follow these fools into the mess they made!!:)"
1,Margin Call,"It wasn't as enjoyable as I thought it would be and that's the truth, the truth, the truth, the truth."
5,Columbia Rabbit lined hat,"Awesome hat, very warm, looks good, does the job and made by Columbia, what more could I ask for? feels nice & soft to my gf also.... :)"
5,Rabbit Fur Warmth,"Purchased for my hubby, and he loves his new Rabbit hat from Columbia. Durable and a perfect fit (Large)."
3,Nice but still Chinese,"After looking at other Bessey clamps at the Big Box store and seeing that they were made in Germany, I was very disappointed when these arrived with a Made in China copy on the packaging. Nice clamps and a good price on Amazon however."
3,Good Source,This book is becoming outdated. Written 1998 and is therefore 10 years old. Needs to be updated ASAP!
3,Interesting,Ms Banks is an excellent writter. A little long on the dialogue for my taste but her writting otherwize is excellent! She keeps your interest. It's only after reading scores of pages that you realize that only a few hours or even minutes have passed. It's a lot like a soap opera.
3,Not Japanese but OK,"In spite of the fact that this has a Japanese name and a picture of a Japanese woman on the package, it is not Japanese. The reason I know this is not my seaweed expertise, but the fact that ""Product of China"" is stamped on the inside packages. Of course, English being what it is, the ""Japanese"" could refer to the seasoning as well as the type, but...... It's my understanding (from Wikipedia, I think) that Chinese seaweed is cheaper and lower quality than Japanese.It tastes OK if you're a fan of roasted nori, as I am, and it's certainly the cheapest. However, I prefer Sea's Gift and that Japanese teriyaki-flavored one that comes in a jar. Both of these are also available on Amazon."
3,"Good, but not my favorite seaweed","This seaweed is good, but not very flavorful. It has a mild teriyaki-type flavor but no spiciness, as the product describes. Becasue it isn't fried in oil (which is why it's fat-free), it's not light and crispy, but rather chewy, like nori naturally is. The packaging is convenient, you'll get your vitamin burst (which is why I eat it), and you'll get a low-calorie snack, no-fat snack, however. My favorite nori is the stuff roasted in sesame oil (the perfect compliment to the fishy flavor of seaweed), like Seas's Gift, but seaweed roasted in oil is not a low-fat snack. Just be aware that low-fat seaweed = chewy texture. I probably won't buy this again - I'm going to try Yamamotoyama Teriyaki Nori Seaweed next."
2,Drops keys,"This keyboard adapter has trouble with multiple keypresses - if you need to use ctrl-x followed by ctrl-f , it can lose the fact that you still have ""ctrl"" held down. It thus works horribly for video games or complicated text editing, and so I can not recommmend it. A keyboard adapter should not lose track of keys."
5,Have never had any complaints - also works with non-keyboard ps2 devices well.,"I have some IBM ps2 keyboards (the ""Real PS/2"") that I love using. Most USB to PS/2 adapters handle that just fine. One other item I use is a mag stripe reader (lots of MSR200 types). This is the only adapter that seems to throttle the serial connection properly to make them work (Belkin and IOGear both have issues). Not sure what is different, but if you use some older ps2 devices ( mag stripe readers/bar code readers) this may be the adapter for you."
5,peter,the reprint edition is as good as i remember the original. neutra's work deserves exposure to current architects captured by the power of computers to design novelty. simplicity and siting are still the key.
4,overall fantastic,- the only problem is the small format of the 25th anniversary - texts are minuscule to read. Format reduction must be done within certain limits !!!
4,"Good, for kids.",Sturdy enough construction for kids (until they outgrow them at least). Better than a lot of 'novelty' skates on the market with licensed characters on them. These are actual high-boot rolleskates and provide a lot more support and safety than those.
4,I like it,The binding was somewhat loose on the book and the corners were very worn. It did however arrive on time and contains minimal marks inside.
4,Nice sturdy bath bench,"Nice bath bench. Sturdy, doesn't slide around. Bought this for an elderly relative after a hip break, and it's been invaluable for his bathing. Works well in conjunction with a hand-shower attachment. Only gripe is that it's a bit bulky, and has to be heaved in and out of a shower-tub by anyone else who wants to use the shower."
5,Great Sturdy Shower Chair,Took less than a minute to put together. It is very sturdy and has no problem holding 230+ lbs. Glad I went with this one. It won't rust like the metal ones.
4,"AN ""ABSTRACT"" BREATH OF FREASH AIR !!!","I begin this review first with that I almost never write reviews on any of my viewings or purchases,but this one raise my browe. Plain and simple, the first EP puzzle's if not wierds you out then the second captivates you.the third one completes the addiction to this series in which I found to be very intertaining on many level'sMy list of rating this animation is EXCELLENT!!! the storylineSUPPERB!!!! the character's are VERY INVOLVING TO SAY THE LEASTthou the main character is a little annoying "" what what what's happening"" HA HA HA , But to say the least you won't feel ript off if you purchase this excellent series.I'm also one to encourage poeple to rent first, dvd's aren't exactly a dime a dozen, get my drift, you may like something different ""ya know"" I hope this been helpful like I said idon't do this much."
1,woulda been a good manga,"I would have to agree with some of the other reviewers here that the detail is amazing, but that does not make up for this title's shortcommings.The bigest problem I have is that the scenes don't really connect. It's almost like watching a manga.The characters movements didn't really seem smooth either. Not what I'd expect from a modern anime.Another problem for me was the colors. There wasn't much use of natural colors. Each scene had aporx 6 colors to it (almost like they didn't have enough $$ to make the film). Each scene also had different colors than the previous. That added to the disconnected feeling.Overall it gave me a headache. The plot was very average. If you are a liberal arts major you might like how abstract it is, but it's pretty bad in my opinion."
2,"It's a Nightmare, and it Doesn't Shine","Is Ms. Myers winding down her Den of Antiquity series? This one was the worst yet. Abby over-reacts a lot (as she does in several of the later books) and once again the humor is just not there. The victim in this story is Tweetie, Abby's ex-husband's wife. It took about 50 pages before we know there's been a murder, as the author takes us through chapters of unnecessary prose that went nowhere. Abby's involvement in this murder sounds contrived, and we don't really care when there is a second victim. Abby's sleuthing is poor, and her realization of who the killer is is barely sensible. The killer him or herself is revealed at the end with not much to lead up to it, though Abby's face-off with him or her was enjoyable. Abby moves to another town at the end of this book. Let's hope her move benefits the entertainment value in the series."
5,What the Bible never included....,"I bought this book because I enjoy the work of CS Friedman, and once again, I wasn't disappointed. Technically, this work is an adjunct to the game ""Vampire: The Masquerade"" (also published by White Wolf), but it stands wonderfully on its own as a work of artistry, mysticism, and sheer fun. The Fragments include a version of Genesis which has never before (ahem) seen the light of day, and which brings the history of the vampire mythos/game setting into a nifty ""historical"" context. Most chilling are the Prophecies, and most fun are the Proverbs--all illustrated with drawings by various artists, and commented upon by several vampire scholars, whose often feisty marginalia provoked me several times to snorts of laughter. If you're easily offended by twists on Biblical history, avoid this one. But, oh, if you like vampires, alternate history, and a delicious frisson on the nape of your neck, it doesn't come much better than The Erciyes Fragments."
1,family tree maker 2006,"I bought this program retail today. As best I can tell, it installed OK. Except, when I went to access the ancestry.com program that was advertised as part of the package. It might be there but I can't find it. The improvements in this product are not significant enough for me to have paid $99.99 for it without promised additions. I would not have bought this program had it not been for inclusion of the ancestry.com program. Where is it?"
1,Not at all Accurate,"If Amazon.com's software would allow a rating of ""No Stars"" this stud finder would get it!As the other writer pointed out, the switch on this thing is terrible. It is too sensitive. Also, you can't put this in your tool apron because the switch kicks on everytime it bumps something (even slightly) in there. This causes that annoying error tone.Finally, it is simply not accurate. When I first got it, I tested it. It didn't find studs where I knew there was one and it said there was one when I knew there wasn't. I don't trust it's accuracy at all and I might as well throw it in the garbage because I don't use this one anymore. I bought a different one and am much happier."
5,Recommended,"From the first minute I opened this book I realized it was a treasure. ""Light on Life"" follows the same track as Patangali's Yoga Sutras in it's content without following it's structure in form. Mr. Iyengar personalizes the Yoga Sutra teachings with stories from his own life's struggles/tragedies/blessings and in doing so brings the timeless message of the Sutra's into modern perspective. His writing style is direct and sincere as he shares the wisdom he has gained through his life in Yoga."
3,Don't hold anything hot!,"Well, the color is absolutely perfect (exactly as pictured). And they are sturdy, not flimsy.But they don't really protect me from the heat. Just don't hold anything too hot! :( If I cook something at 450 or above I can definately feel the heat through the potholder, and if I hold it for more than 60 seconds it starts to become uncomfortable."
4,Very Nice,I shopped around before purchasing this item & this price was very reasonable. Very well made & nice looking. I would recommend this item. I would also purchase this item again.
5,Incident at Hawk's Hill,"This book is about a father that does not give up. In most books nobody gives up, but in this book all the neighbors give up searching for the father's lost son. The dad and the older brother all continue searching for two months. A badger with no family took the boy in and fed him and he drank from a depression in a rock. When they found him, he spat and acted like a badger. It was really good and exciting."
3,incident at hawk hill,At the beginning this book was so boring then it got juicey and really good so if you read this book don't worry it all gets better trust me!!!!!!
2,Incident At Hawk's Hill,This bood is about a six year old boy who is small. He gets lost and lives with a badger. The Badger and the boy care for each other. I thought that this book wasn't all that great. Although the end was kind of exciting. The first part of the book was way boring to me. I would only read this book if you like to read about survival and animals. That's my view of this book anyway. You read it for yourself. Although I think it is boring.
1,"This Book really stunk, I didn't like it at all!!!",I did not like this book because who in the right mind would crawl into a hole and live with a badger for a long time when the boy could have stayed at home and apoligized and been warm and cozy in his bed!
2,No Help for my needs,"Unfortunately ""Perfectly Painted House: A Foolproof Guide for Choosing Exterior Colors for Your Home"". (1) It wasn't any help in choosing the perfect color(s) for our home. We have a bungalow style home built in 1925 - there was only one color choice in the book for similar home(red) personally did not care for color. I was looking for siding color w/trim & door color choices i.e. 3 colors. (2) We do not plan on painting our house ourselves (many hints for doing same). Very disappointed in this particular book."
5,Extra hand for a little price!,"Great Product for little cost! A must in any workshop! Very stong clamp power. If you need extra hands for any project, here is your solution! Get at least 2...."
1,Very disappointing,"When I first got this book and just thumbed through it, it seemed like it was going to be a good book. However, the more I actually read the chapters, the more I find it utterly lacking in content. The author does not explain things very much if at all. Many places, its just pages of source code listings with little or no comments and no explanations. Then when you get to the end of one source code listing, basically the only commentary is ""and here's the next listing.."". This annoying lack of explanations also carries through to the appendix, where a ""JSP and Servlett API Reference"" is included - problem is, its nothing but a commentless, explanationless dump of the member function prototypes. Fortunately, I bought this book used for $10. If I had paid the new price for it I would really be upset and would return it. That's my opinion."
1,Kindle Edition,"This may be a good book, but after downloading the sample on my Kindle, it is impossible to read code samples. The zoom feature doesn't work on them either. I've noticed this in other programming books as well. Stick with the paper editions."
3,First LP + Two bonus cuts,"For a short time, the U.S.-based Colossus label successfully foraged hits from the Dutch record charts, including sides by Dutch bands Shocking Blue and The George Baker Selection, and Sweden's Blue Swede, led by vocalist Bjorn Skifs.This best-of includes the 10 tracks on Blue Swede's American debut LP (""Hooked on a Feeling"") plus two bonus tracks. Included in that is the group's #1 1974 cover of B.J. Thomas' ""Hooked on a Feeling"" (with the 'Ooga-chucka' intro that writer Wilson Brian Key famously picked for its supposed subliminal content), plus lesser-known hits such as their cover of The Association's ""Never My Love.""This is competent bubblegum-flavored rock, but little of it rises to the memorable qualities of their #1 single."
4,Good Monk story,"I read this on the heels of finishing Mr. Monk and the Two Assistants which by the way had me laughing out loud - to the point where my kids were laughing at my laughing. Firehouse is a good story but it reveals the culprit too soon, misses out on some of the lol over the top OCD moments that play out in the Two Assistants and lingers during Natalie's dates with Fireman Joe. Still it's a welcome addition to my library and stands alongside my four other Monk books (missing Monk Goes to Hawaii). I thoroughly enjoy Lee's writing. Keep them coming."
4,Classic Monk,"This book had several places where I had to smile or laugh just picturing Monk in that situation. I particularly liked when Monk and Natalie have to search through mountains of garbage at the transfer station to find a piece of evidence. You have to read it to appreciate it. And in this book, Monk is staying with Natalie and Julie because his apartment is being exterminated by his landlord. That doesn't really go well. I actually think in the books that Monk is presented more obsessive and compulsive and more difficult to deal with than on the TV show. This storyline gives Natalie a little romantic bit too. And as always, Natalie is telling the story from her perspective. It actually gives you insight into Natalie's thoughts and feelings as she moves through her days with Monk that you don't get from the show. This story intertwines a house fire with the killing of a firehouse dog, the latter which upsets Julie and she asks Monk to investigate. Fun read. I recommend."
4,Funny but not silly--a rare combination,"There is just nowhere else that you can get a serious, tightly-written detective story (okay, murder mystery) that is also a laugh every page. And not silly, either. Aside from the challenge of following the clues, and admiring Monk's analytical skills through the faithful narration of Natalie Teeger, we learn a lot about ourselves through the gifts and the limitations of Monk's condition.For fans of the TV series, I can say that Tony Shalhoub comes through great in writing. I only wish they could have given us Traylor Howard on the cover too, since her character is also a star in the stories. With her struggling not-quite-normality, she is the rest of us."
3,Fun but short,"I got this game and finished it within 3 days. It is sad to see a game ending so quicky. I am still playing Golden Sun for GBA for about 7 months now. Everything else about this game is good. Gaphics, Gameplay, Multiplayer experiance (without split screen), It was really too short that was the problem. And I also notice the world is not excatly so origional.. there were 3 worlds all 3 of them were sort of familiar to the ones in diablo's 3 acts, for world one it was basicly like the monistary from diablo, world 2 was like a desert and snowy planes of act 2 and 5(exp), and world 3 was like a marshy lands of diablo's act 3's terrain"
3,Entertaining for bit. But way to short.,"This game has some nice visual affects, wonderfull control and the hack n slash style battle system is refreashing. I didnt like the battle system on the PC baldurs gate, and in fact that was the only thing that kept me from really getting into it. However I gave this game only 3 starts for various reasons. First it was just way to easy. I bought this game on a thursday and passed it on saturday. It wouldnt have been to bad if it was atleast a little longer too. I couldnt beleive how short this game was compared to the rest of the series. Lastly there was a lack of depth. There was just nothing that really grabed me and took me in; Nothing at all. If your looking for something to tide you over for the weekend this game is for you. But rent it, pass it and be done with it."
4,it freezes,"i luv this game.. BUT when i get to a certain spot in it it just keeps repeating itselfs.. i cant get past it.. iv tried it on 2 dofferentx-boxes.. same thing.. i even rented the same game,, same thing.. and now im stuck with the game that wont play. i want to return it!!!"
3,good but keeps you wanting more,"just wanted to say that this is a good game ,story and action is good also.The problem i have with this title is that i found it way too short way too easy,and definetly too linear.So unless your a dongeon and dragons or a fantasy fan dont buy it because for 55 dollars you are not going to get your moneys worth.Too bad because i would like to see more games like this on game cube."
5,Well Produced Yarn Based On The Original Dr. Who Serial,"There is no doubt in my mind that this spinoff recreated the joy and mystery of Dr. Who. To me it is the perfect stop gap between the new and the old series. This episode shows us more about the intricacies of the Sontarans than some of the original Doctor Who episodes.I won't go into the plot, save to say that the myraid characters and the setting make it similar to an Agatha Christie book-- with very good special effects. That's right, the tape showcases some great special effects that even rival those of the original series! That shocked me.Get this on tape if you can. I'm proud to own one and I realize there are very few left and none of them new. This goes to show that one should always keep a fully functioning vcr in their home. Why? Because there I so much product out there that was never transferred to DVD!A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr."
5,Excellent,"I have seen many Doctor Who spinoffs and fan fictions, and this is one of the best if not the best. There are many actors from Doctor Who and Blake's 7 that fans will recognise, the slightly different take on the Sontarans was enjoyable, believable and worked well. The production values are surprisingly high."
1,Not true,"# Heat won't penetrate, protect tables and countertopsThis is a false statement. Heat will penetrate in a very short time. Use with caution."
1,What non-slip feet?,"Amazon's description of this product is wrong! It is correct in that they are the size and material described, but there are NO feet to help this very slippery material from moving as one attempts to cut something. Yes it is described as a cutting board also (and its graphic on the front of the actual product describes it thus.) If you are thinking of using these for a cutting board, don't. You may lose a finger."
1,Love Joanna Brady,"the standard characters are well maintained and well developed. Having lived in Arizona for 26 years, I can see the desert AND feel the heat. At the beginning there are three different murders, plus pregancy. It all works out and I can't wait for the next book. A good bedtime read."
5,Praise for Marilee's LTC Book,"I needed information on Long Term Care, not only from a prospective of Insurance Options but on other options and programmes out there. Well, this is the one book which provides a really good overall view into this interesting topic.I would advise not only consumers but financial professionals to read this book, and use it as a gift to clients!David Leimkuehler, Missouri"
1,childish film from Capulina,"A very mediocre film dealing with the overweight comedian Capulina in yet another one of his many similar type of films. This particular film deals with Capulina trying to escape from the Mummy, Frankenstein, Dracula etc. and that is what the whole film is about it is an excruciatingly childish film, that would probably put even most children to sleep.Stay away from this movie unless you're having trouble sleeping."
2,Hilariously useless swim gear!,"My son broke it open and immediately put it on. I laughed so hard I almost broke my knee bending over to catch my breath. He doesn't care, he's got on Spiderman gear and he's three months away from actually swimming in a pool this year. I think it's a mistake to only have one squirting glove (what if your child is a lefty like mine?) but I suppose the manufacturing costs might have pushed this past the forty dollar mark at a retail store.UPDATE: 07-June-2008: hot day at my sister's pool, my man puts it on, and they immediately prove... worthless. The flippers don't really flip, and the hand flippers are more of a nuisance than anything else. The goggles won't stay on correctly. The one web shooter does shoot this ridiculously long, thin stream of water, which only my daughter found amusing enough to keep using. It looks like fun, but in practice it really wasn't. We'll try again this weekend, but I don't have much hope for it.-C"
3,could have been better,"When I first bought this game I expected it to be awesome. But when I played it I was a little dissapointed.I heard the graphics were really good, and to me they made me feel like I was playing an N64 game. Other than that it was alright. If you can find one for 20 bucks, get it. It will make you feel better if your a destructive person. You may want to play it at a friends house first though, or rent it. All in all it could have been better."
2,You dont wanna rent this or buy it,This game is no good. Its so hard. none of the cars are good. the game gets even weird when you push the boost button. instedt its in slow motin.
2,Undistinctive,"This album completely lacks originality. I sampled a few songs, and after about 20 seconds of each, I was thinking ""I recognize this phrasing and beat."" Even intra-album, much is repetitive.I honestly can't believe Amazon recommended this to me this since I have Robert Miles' Dreamland and Chicane's Behind the Sun. Listen to the mix and originality in those albums, and compare it to this album."
5,The Ithaca Gun Company,This is great book and well worth the read. Quality pictures and stuffed with lots of information on this great Company and its products.
1,A WASTE of MONEY,"I bought this tape in hopes of increasing my reading speed. But it teaches the inapropriate hand motion for speed reading. It gave NO techniques to increase speed. If you want to learn to speed read try a book by Howard Burg, you will do much better than you ever would using this video. The emphasis was on speed and not comprehension."
3,Wished it reclined too,"The seat's arm rests are kind of flimsy and easily detached. The belt takes some getting use to when buckling my daughter in but it is also easily adjusted on the go. Be careful not to pinch your child's inner thighs when clicking the lower straps into place (happened once to us). The unit does not recline for a child to sleep in and I would have paid more for a unit that does. Now when my daughter falls asleep, her head leans uncomfortably to one side (the seat back is very steep, maybe almost 90 degrees)."
2,"Not very long lasting, difficult to use","We purchase this seat for our 4 yo son. The tightening buckle in the front was appealing, but it is way to hard to use. It doesn't give slack evenly. And changing the straps positions as the child grows is almost impossible. Very difficult. My son is very capable of getting in and buckling himself, but hates this car seat. We have had it for 1 year and are now looking for another for him."
5,Beat all the rest for sensitive feet,"I tested this sock against over 2 dozen other brands and styles for sensitive feet (diabetic and otherwise). This sock came out number one because it did not bind my leg or fall down. These are not compression socks. They were comfortable to wear all day. Other socks were so thin, they developed holes after the first washing.These crew socks were true to size. I have a size 12, 4E flat foot. I re-ordered the Large (sizes 9 - 12) because it fit better than the extra large (sizes 12-15). The extra large was too loose and fell down during the day. The Large size was perfect for me. Stayed in place without binding my leg.After repeated washings, they are still soft without any holes. Both the black and white are excellent and identical in fit and wear.Bonus feature: With ""Wigwam"" written on the side, I can keep my white socks separated from my wife's socks."
1,1 pair?,No where on the description did it say 1 pair. I should have at least got 2 pair of socks in this order for this price. I am disappointed. Now I have to buy other socks to make up for this 1 in the present.
3,I wish it was more clear that this is one (1) pair of socks.,"These are very good quality socks, and I intend to keep them and use them. I thought there were two pair in the package. I think the description is a little misleading, hence only three stars. I think it's a little spendy for two socks, so I doubt I'll buy more until I get a better idea of how long these will last. I suppose the other thing is that I'm still getting used to how expensive it is to be diabetic. Still, I like my feet a lot, and I'd like to keep them as long as I can even though I can't feel them so much any more. Very good socks, as I say. Also I recommend the woolen thermal Wigwam socks as well. Bring your wallet, though."
4,Classic Blues/Jazz Mix,Neighborhoods picks up right where Natchez to New York left off. Olu Dara continutes with his soulful themes and bluesy gituar. This album is a perfect compliment to his previous works and will hold your attention from the first song to the last. At times the album can get a little slow and tedious but Olu Dara's soulful voice keeps you caught up in this excellent album.
1,The title says it all,"First of all, I am not a kid. Second, this album shows how KMFDM is better of without En Esch. This is pretty much just ordinary techno music, which is just all out repetitive and boring. Without Sascha or Gunter, Esch is nothing. Slick Idiot albums suck too, by the way."
1,A Chore to Sit Through!,"This song, ""The Scientist"", is terrible! Coldplay are the kind of band that everyone can just go on and on about how great and brilliant they are, but I just don't agree. Coldplay are boring, dull, conventional, and their music doesn't go anywhere. It doesn't really capture you and make you want to continue listening. I found this to be the most boring of their songs on Rush of Blood to the Head. Very very overrated band!"
5,Jose Carreras/Passion,"From the first note to the last, Jose Carreras has-once again-reminded both loyal fans and new friends what a lyric tenor voice should sound like! He's magnificent! From Ave Maria to Brave New World, his voice carries you on a wonderful journey of sound. Powerful as the opera and gentle as a breeze! A definite must for fans and new friends!"
2,A Paean to Pakistan -- and Little Else,"The CIA:1: was (probably) responsible for Zia'a death2: didn't know the first thing about how to wage a guerilla war3: either allowed or participated in widespread corruption and theft4: was foolishly reluctant to install an Islamic fundamentalist government in Kabul, and5: at the end, intentionally pulled the rug out from under the Mujahadeen.Pakistan's ISI, on the other hand, was wise, incorruptible and only cared about winning the war.Other than maybe 10 pages describing a handful of battles, I've just told you everything there is in this book."
2,very disappointing!,"the granite top is askew (came previously glued into place) by about 15 degrees, the leg holes for the bottom shelf did not line up properly, and it had missing feet. considering the shoddy craftsmanship, it's worth only about $35 but we paid almost $200 for it! we've done business with home decorators for years now and have come to expect quality products from them. this table is almost too misshapen to even consider placing in my home. this was a very disappointing experience."
2,Self-Promotion At Its Best ...,"This is the DVD equivilent of throwing your own suprise party. While Oprah's success can't be argued and her fans might be interested in this retrospective, I can't help but point out that this is the biggest self-congradulation I've ever seen.It's nice that the profit from the DVD sales is going to charity, this really shouldn't be overlooked, but ""The Big O's"" ego seems endless and this multi-disk tribute to herself seems to prove it."
5,I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF OPRAH FOR MANY YEARS..HER NEW RELEASE SHOULD BE WELCOMED BY HER FANS.,"I HAVE JUST RECEIVED THE DVD SET ON TUES MORNING.IVE FOUND THAT THESE DISCS CONTAIN THE BEST OF THE BEST SHOWS, AND MUCH MORE.OPRAH STANDS FOR HONESTY AND INTEGRITY.SHE WOULD NOT HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY .HER SHOW CHANGED OVER THE YEARS ,BUT NEVER WOULD SHE STOOP TO THE SPRINGER MENTALITY.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED .."".OPRAH FANS WILL LOVE THIS SET."""
1,What a tedious book.,"I love books and it is very rare that I find one as disappointing as Cosmopolis. I am a creative writing student and am aware of newer fiction genres and even with this perspective Cosmopolis defies explanation. Had it been written by anyone other than Don Delillo I doubt very much if it would have even made the top of an agent's desk. The main character is dismal, and the book lurches too and fro with at the same speed as the car he is in. You can skip this one."
2,Movie better than the book?,"The video trailer for the movie looked very interesting, but the book seemed to lose me. I forced myself to read it because I purchased the book. Not one I would read again."
1,Unreadable,"A sophomoric, cliche-ridden and financially illiterate portrait of the investment world. Probably the worst novel I have ever tried to read. I gave up a quarter of the way through."
2,Gone off the tracks,"This book is, quite simply, not good. End Zone, White Noise and Underworld are all truly amazing works that show an author at the peak of his powers.Cosmopolis, like The Body Artist, smacks of an experiment gone awry. Suprisingly for someone as iconoclastic as Delillo, he seems to have fallen into an all-too-familiar trap. After the breakthrough success of Underworld, he has begun writing in a new style, apparently feeling like he's done all he can with his previous style.I can only hope Delillo abandons this experiment soon."
2,Hot Dog Cooker,"The first one we received did not rotate. The second one we received was not in the original packaging, so I assume it was returned and repaired and send out as a replacement. It had a broken grease catching cup. It worked for about 5 minutes and then quit rotating also. We waited a little while and tried it again and it did rotate. However, not sure if we want to keep or not.Not a very good product."
5,An Honest and Unbiased Account of the Freedom Movement,"This book is one of the most honest and unbiased account of the Indian freedom movement. A must read for all Indians/Pakistanis who otherwise have a biased view of the events, based on the history books available in their countries.In this book, Maulana Azad describes the political events between 1939-1947 and explains his views on the political blunders that lead to partition. While Maulana is severely critical of Jinnah and the Muslim League for playing the communal card, he does not shy away from blaming Nehru for the failure of the Cabinet Mission plan, and Sardar Patel for his indifference towards the loss of muslim life in the aftermath of partition. It is the sad story of a truly secular and nationalist man, whose dream of independance was tainted by the partition of a nation he loved so dearly. Truly honest and thought provoking."
4,Gritty and entertaining.,"This is my first Jess Walter book recommended to me by a friend. I enjoyed it, didn't have it figured out until the end which I love! Ending left me hanging though."
1,Useless on a Kindle - not searchable.,Another reviewer wrote that this worked well with Kindle's seach feature. But when I tried to search for a word it told me that this book is not set up for searching. Maybe one of the other editions is. I'm glad I only paid 99 cents.
3,Not too helpful for small groups.,"We are a small congregation. Most of this book seemed to be directed at a larger group. To set up the organization they suggest, we would need every member serving on four or five committeess, yet they suggest no one shouild do more than one or two. I had trouble seeing how to apply their ideas to our situation. A larger congregation, with a liking for lots of committee work would likely find this book more helpful."
1,The songs were not the original -very disappointed,The songs were remix - remakes were not the original - I'm quite disappointed - you cannot fool a 70 year old African American who danced to Little Willie John's music in the fifties.Thank You!
1,"Best of the Bluetooth headsets, but bleh.","I bought this headset as a final attempt to find a decent Bluetooth headset for Skype. This one is definitely the best I've used so far, but the sound quality is cell phone at best. If you use Skype with others that have USB headsets, they will know you are a poor quality headset. If you don't need something that sounds better than cell phone quality, this is your best option."
1,"No Vista Drivers, range no where near 30 feet","This headset was horrible. Range is no where near 30 feet, and drops connection at very short ranges if anything is in the way of the receiver, like your head, which is common with an over the ear headset. Also, there are no Vista drivers for the device despite the fact that Vista has been our for over year."
1,Dick Francis,I love Dick Francis and enjoy reading his books over and over. This was one of the most exciting of the series.
4,Excellent music.,Labyrinth were introduced to me through napster and I was impressed by their skill. I went and got the cd the next day and was not disappointed. They have a sound their own and can't be compared to other bands. buy the cd.....
5,Great Book,"The ARRL has been writing license manuals for years, this is the only way to go. I got my Extra Class just after I passed the General test and still refer to all of the books for information."
5,This is a killer disc!,"This album started me out playing the drums. My mother had this and I used to groove to it all of the time. I remember playing with my practice pad and dreaming of the days of playing this well. Lots of groovey beats and solid playing and if you are not a musicain, you love it just as much. This is a killer disc!!!"
4,Good percussion work,I've been looking for these two (combined on the CD) albums for a long time. I really enjoyed them.
4,Shows why Sandy Nelson should be in the Hall of Fame,"[[ASIN:B00000094I Let There Be Drums/Drums Are My BeatI love this CD. Sandy Nelson was the primary reason I became a drummer in the first place. He also inspired thousands of other young percussionists with his ""Let There Be Drums"" and other hits.It is a travesty that Sandy Nelson has been kept out of the Drumming Hall of Fame. I understand that he is not considered the most technically proficient when compared to others, but his impact in increasing the visibility of modern popular drumming cannot be denied. Please email the Drumming Hall of Fame (google it) and ask that Sandy Nelson be inducted."
5,Solid Family Entertainment,"This is a very entertaining movie, and not irritating (like many kids' movies can be) when your kids want to watch it several times in a row. Absolutely beautiful footage of the desert, gorgeous horse, and really cute kids. Three kids stow away in big brother's car, with the plan to capture three wild mustangs in the Nevada desert and ""ride them home for supper"". Lots of exciting scenes, the kids get to be the heroes, and it isn't too scary for the little ones. Our teenaged neighbors enjoy the movie, just as much as my not-yet-teens do.I suspect that the ""professional movie reviewer"" who gave this movie a bad rating wasn't really watching the movie, since she got the entire plot wrong. Definitely worth the money!"
1,Disappointing,I bought this DVD because my daughter LOVES horses. I bought it after reading the reviews and am greatly disappointed. The movie is awful and doesn't show horses in it as much as I would have thought. The plot of the movie is scary for young children. I wasted my money.
2,Probabaly not for a 5 year old...,"I thought my almost 5 year old, horse-obsessed daughter would love this movie. While she liked it, there were some things I didn't like about it. There's kidnapping first off, which isn't violent, but certainly not what I expected. Then there's a trusted family friend who turns out to be a ""good guy gone bad"", which just again isn't sending a message a 5 year old should be getting (IMO). There was a lot of anger, yelling and to be honest, NOT a whole lot of horse in it."
5,Excellent!,"I grew up listening to this tape in the car and now that I've got my first child on the way, I can't wait to play it for her!"
4,Schiz-prog,Very few bands can get away with these pretentious experiments at a level of such informed fluidity.
1,Didn't help at all,"I really wanted this recording to help me achieve deep sleep, and before using it I felt confident that it would. Unfortunately, after having this disc on during the past three nights I must report that it has not affected my sleeping patterns at all. I continue to sleep rather lightly, occasionally waking, and feeling tired and unrefreshed in the morning. Perhaps this recording has been beneficial for some, but don't expect it to be a guaranteed panacea for your sleeping problems. Most cable and satellite broadcast companies have a variety of music channels available, and I strongly suggest that you try leaving a New Age channel on at a low volume when you go to sleep; that will probably be every bit as helpful as this disc."
4,FAST PACED KEPT ME INVOLVED,"AUDIO BOOKS MADE MY TRAVELS SEEM LESS LENGTHY, LESS BORING, I DEPENDED ON AUTHORS I TRUSTED TO GET ME 'DOWN THE ROAD' AWAKE!!! THIS WILL NOT PUT YOU TO SLEEP, I PROMISE."
1,Can I give this stupid book less than 1 star?????,"This was the WORST book! Pure torture. I don't know how publishers can sleep at night knowing they allow books like this loose in the world.The characters are supposed to be complex, yet they are completely one-dimensional. No personality. Dialogue verges on simpleton. The daughter Jane is dull as dirt, no personality, talks like an adult...yet we are supposed to believe she's a 12 year old w/ a troubled past. Huh? Supposed to be this great love affair between Joe, the ""tough"" cop and Eve. No evidence of that. Eve is a whiner and Joe is just a cop. Galen is supposed to be some complex, dark, protector. Just sounds like a pain in the arse to me.This book is not good enough to use as a drink coaster. Don't waste your time."
2,"""Precious Protagonist""","In the latest book, ""Body of Lies"", Eve is becoming a bit too ""precious"" and is in imminent danger of becoming unlikable. Eve calls all the shots and makes it clear that her job is more important than anyone else's. This is reinforced by the fact that everyone around her seems to tread delicately on eggshells and think nothing of leaving home/job to support her. Plausible? What I enjoyed about prior books was the give and take between the main characters, which appears to be absent in ""Body of Lies"". However, Galen is a good inclusion that nicely offsets the neurotic Eve. Jane also has good potential for her own lead, but Joe, unfortunately, is too tragically besotted to be anything but a crutch."
3,Even men read her.....,"""Even men read her"" is quite an acclaim for a female writer the way I see it.In this story the forensic sculptoress Eve is constantly ""mad as [heck]""to speak with the author. She is cross with everyone except her pert child Jane, who seems to be the adult here. Joe is the ever so besotted lover, a total wimp when it comes to Eve, otherwise an ex-marine sniper, whom she is cross with and bosses around, while he caters to each one of her whimsical whims. They are both [weak] to say the least. The heroine is constantly guarded by a retinue of men like the queen in a bee hive. These men parade around until they get killed. Typical for a female writer there is much kitchen activity and men do all the cooking and nurturing. Galen is a likeable chap and a fresh breathe of air. I give the book credit for being entertaining. Johansen starts out with a good plot about a secret society but she has trouble seeing it through. Gerborg"
3,A reasonably interesting read...,"...but one I wish I'd borrowed instead of bought.Too many aspects of this book felt artificial. Too many times, the right person just happened to show up at the right time, an important clue is discovered by the only person who understands it, and so on. The whole premise that the heroine, Eve Duncan, is the *only* person in the whole world gifted enough to produce a face from a found skull is just too contrived; there are many great forensic artists in real life. Her life is saved in the nick of time by a man who seemingly has connections, wealth and an incredible fount of knowledge from etiquette to how to kill someone. Her 12 year old adopted daughter has the patience of a saint and the intuition of a sage. Her boyfriend is able to come and go from his job as a policeman anytime trouble stirs around her. The story was just too contrived for me. I did read all the way through, however this was mainly to see how it ended and not because it was overly gripping."
5,A Heartwarming Tale,"A reviewer, A reviewer, September 9, 2004,This book was heartwarming.This book will make you happy, sad and angry. It especially touched me because I could relate to the story having lost family members with this illness. Esther had lots of spirit. The characters were so warm and real that I felt I knew them personally. This is a great book and I recommend it highly."
4,no closed captioning option,"Great, balanced documentary... but no closed captioning available. Not very progressive, folks, to omit such a basic feature from a dvd."
2,Stop the insanity,"Okay, so I've only seen this film once, and it was a while ago so I'm not going to go into the details of why this film is not as good as previously advertised. Every review I read for this film is just praising it, but it's not deserved. This is an okay movie at best. some of the plot lines are pretty good, but some of them are just stupid, i.e. everything that had to do with the stupid cougar. The acting is very strong, and the mixture of animation with live action was interesting, even though Kieren Culkin's alter ego reeked of unresolved psychological issues that no adolescent boy would ever share with his friends in reality. This film tries too hard to be ""independent."" In doing so it falls into the trap of independent cliche. The ending is just plain bad, and for me this will ruin any movie. I did highly enjoy the ghost storyline, however. For those concerned with such information, Jena Malone is mad hot in this film, albeit very illegal."
3,VDO is always good,Fun satire movie. Good cast. Foster and D'onofrio are always good. Some of the kids have to look forward to great carrers.
3,Heard a number of tracks on college radio last night . . . .,Good rock with that gragae band feel. Nice harmonies buried in back.
4,great tunes but a mixed bag on quality,"Take a look at the liner notes on this release. There are several different engineers remastering these songs into 5.1 channels. The results are uneven at best and really bad at worst. It is an unsettling experience to hear some tracks really rock in all six channels, then the next track might have very little high end (Bad to the Bone), then the next track might have only ambient sound in the surrounds whereas other tracks place instruments in them. If you get this DVD-Audio release (and you still ought to), DON'T listen to it all the way through...partial out the songs, listen to a couple at a time. If not, you may leave this one on the shelf for a long time as the wide varying mastering techniques tend to fatigue the listener...you simply cannot get into a groove."
5,DVD Audio - Rock Collection.,"Volume #1 in Silverline's DVD Audio 96Khz 5.1 surround - plus DTS and Dolby Digital tracks in 5.1 - collection of classic rock tracks from the 60's, 70's, and 80's. This collection ranges from Canned Heat's On the Road Again (1968) through Sugarloaf's Green Eyed Lady and Billy Idol's Rebel Yell to John Waite's Change from 1985. The 11 tracks are supported by photos of the artists as a Back Ground Video option as their song is playing. The remastering to 5.1 is excellant as everything is sourced from multi-track masters - The stand-out tracks (in my opion) being: Centerfold - J. Geils Band; Heartbreaker - Pat Benatar, and the Canned Heat track, which is superb!"
4,Good quality muffler.,"The muffler length and inlet/outlet diameter were a perfect match to the original muffler on a 1995 Dodge Caravan. The width across the oval cross section was smaller, so I had to modify the muffler clamp that wraps around the muffler to make the clamp fit."
2,The Fine Print,"I purchased this saw believing it was made in the USA. The technical data provided by Amazon states the country of manufacture as being the US. I was very dissapointed when the product arrived and found ""Made In Taiwan"" on the box. I called Milwaukee and was told the US made miter saw, model # 6494, had been discontinued and that the -6 on the end of the model number denotes made in Taiwan. I decided to keep the saw despite this issue, if the quality seemed good. Overall, the saw appeared well made. However I was dissapointed to find a crack in the aluminum base in an area where the casting was quite thin. Needless to say the saw is being returned, and I am shopping for a different brand."
4,Really like this and it tans nicely.,"This product does work. I must be getting used to Tingle because sometimes I do not feel it at all. When I accidently touch my face though, it really DOES work/tingle. I tan a dark brown and this does not leave a sticky film like some do. I will definitely purchase again. I alternate this and one of the Hempz lotions and I am a pleased with my shade of brown. I was becoming too dark so I had to cut back on my sessions."
1,Avid Reader,"This was the worst book I have ever read. I bought the book because of the five star ratings and because fresh fantasy romance books are hard to find. The story, I think there was one, was muddled and made no sense what so ever. There was no charachter development. I didn't care what happened to them. I feel cheated. Words can't describe how bad this book was."
3,"A good book, but too many details","I thought this book had a good basic storyline,but there were too many details to follow. It's a good thing that there was a geneology chart in the front, otherwise I would have been hopelessy lost. Also, the alpha male hero was obsessed with sex, so much so that it got old after a while.I still enjoyed reading it though, hopefully her next one won't be so detail oriented."
5,It's a good little drill,"How can you beat it for the money? I have probably 8 different battery operated drills, a couple heaver duty Porter Cables and even an old Rockwell that's over 25 years old. They all have their place. My older Bosch - much like this one and probably 15 years old is still running and the last one just like this got stolen. I bought it to keep in my work van to use in conjunction with or in place of my battery driven drills for those times when you need more speed, consistancy, power or for when the last battery dies.It's nice and light, comfortable to use and it does a good job. It certainly isn't for use with a 4"" hole saw, but if you took your time it'd probably do that too. Great for occasional use and the factory rebuilt tools seem as good as the new ones. If you need a heavier drill, then spend more money. I wouldn't expect this to hold up to day in an day out heavy abuse, not for the price, but then again, my other one has lasted."
3,It is no Suspiria,"It has some nice moments (sometimes interesting sometimes baffling) but overall is too disjointed. The deaths are not staged very well - strange considering that those are Argento's forte. The soundtrack...well maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time. Should be seen, but probably will not be viewed repeatedly."
4,Blu-ray Review,"Huge upgrade from the standard dvd. Solid transfer, great detail and color, nice black tone, contrast and sharpness is great. Some scenes have a heavy grain, some scenes have no grain, but it's a small distraction, it's true to the source. Audio is really good. Compared to a flawless older title Blu-ray transfer like Tron or Flash Gordon, the picture is a B, audio B+."
2,"Disappointing followup to horror classic ""Suspiria""","Apart from one knockout horror sequence (with the heroine swimming in an underwater chamber) this movie never really catches fire. The performances are very poor, in marked contrast to Suspiria. The music is also strangely sedate for a horror film, also in contrast to Suspiria. The look of the film partly makes for the lack of real horror, but only in certain spots. Overall a disappointment."
1,Emerson - Good/Movie - Bad,"If you purchase this movie because you are a fan of Keith Emerson (as I did), the only part you will enjoy is the music. This movie is typical of the nonsense that Europeans call film. It seems its only goal from a visual aspect is to present wild, un-connected poorly acted scenes. The story was almost non-existent. The lighting and set design looked like that of a college film student. The dubbing was almost unbearable to listen to. If you want to support Keith Emerson - buy his CD's."
4,A barrel of fun...,This is the same game as Kerplunk with a monkey theme. The base of the tree snaps together awkwardly..why they couldn't just make a thinner taller box and make the base one unbreakable piece I'll never know. It's still a good game & I would recommend it.
3,Not what I imagined,"I know this game asks for the child to be age 4+, but even that age group will find this game difficult. My husband and I tried to help my son (age 3) with this game, and although my husband enjoyed parts of it, my son was very frustrated. The directions were confusing, even for us, and to acheive the purpose of the games was extremely difficult, and were not at all as educational as I thought they would have been. In addition, they were not that much fun either. I prefer Reader Rabbit for educational purposes and entertainment."
4,Good game for young kids,"This collection of several games for young kids is entertaining and well designed for the most part. An added bonus is being rewarded with clips from the movie as you advance! Finally, kids software that is Mac OS X native. The games themselves are not bad -- the shell game (three shells get moved around, one with a fish under it; you guess which one has the fish), matching game, and ""shark pong"" game are well done. The turtle race and fish swim race are kind of weak. There's also a music band section that unfortunately is not very intuitive as to how to play around with the music. But, overall, a good value and fun for young kids!"
1,STUPID STUPID STUPID,Thank you reviewer M. I had the exact same problem you did and did the exact same thing you did--I finally did a yahoo! search and found your review. You saved me from spending anymore time on this game. I removed it from my computer. thank you for posting.
4,Finding Nemo is good,I bought Finding Nemo when I was 8 and liked it.A bit too easy.I would reccomend it for children 5 to 7. I liked it cause I Like animals.If you have young children buy this as soon as you can.
3,Crowin' across a Harp,"Crows most likely never met Harptones. Even the lengendary corners of New York streets would not have crissed/crossed this complilation.Crows had a big hit, ""Gee"" and maybe some others that cawwed loudly while on the telephone pole wire as they tried to make a noise. The best part of the Crows is the sweet attempt to hit the right note while blinking back the tears/happiness they knew would come when the neighborhood asked for an autograph.Harptones had the Mom and Dad nod that, yes, it was Rhythm and Blues, but Willie Winfield was as good as Nat ""King"" Cole and no problem there. And surely Harptones sang ""Sunday Kind of Love"" like a picnic in the park.This CD is 12 Crows and 12 Harptones, 24 songs of an era. This is for completists and wided-eyed would-be crooners."
1,Of no use!,"Unable to experience this cd due to it's inability to achieve audio output.Although I ordered this product twice, showing my desire for it's content,I was left as empty as it's audio output;(twice) and that hurt alot!!!"
5,A must read,Goldin's book is a wonderfully bold telling of her life and memories of her childhood in Iran. The reader gains insight about the lives of women and Jews in Shiraz that many will never share. A must read.
3,Being Jewish in Iran? The Challenge Begins.,"Of all things, how would you like to be a Jew in Iran? The young girl was an outcast in her own family, as the only daughter with her brothers being the favorites. She cherished her friendships, which she enjoyed until she realized she was ""different."" Gradually, as things worsened in Iran, the Jews were being victimized in the schools and in the communities. Most Jews didn't consider going to Israel as an option because Iran was their home, the language, the Iranian customs, etc., were what they had grown up with. This is a very different look at the situation. I've read many Iranian books and enjoyed the different twist."
1,BAH,THE MOVIE MIGHT HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD BUT THE SOUND ON MY COPYFROM CESIAED WAS SO BAD I THREW IT OUT.
3,Hombre,"Paul Newman is a half breed brought up by Indians in an unforgiving environment where patience, endurance and serenity count far more than bluster and bravado. Here he helps a mixed bunch of people survive through a hostile environment as they are chased and beaten by some rough characters. Though he appears to be selfish and self-centered, Hombre displays qualities that enable others to survive and not give up easily and where death is only one of many options."
5,A Great CD,"The Ride is a great CD. The sound is very different, the music is excellent, and most of all, they rock. With all the canned music out there today, it's refreshing to find a band that's not afraid to take chances. I checked out the Inasense website, and I see the band has changed it's name to Soulfarm. I found their new site at Soulfarm.net; it's a very cool site. They have a new live CD under their new name, Soulfarm. Get their CD's; you won't be dissapointed."
3,SAM530VPC- not very durable,"I have only had this four months, and the little pads that you push in to facilitate insertion of the plug into the phone body for car charging have broken already!I am taking it back and complaining about the junky engineering. Other than that, it worked well! We will see if Verizon exchanges it for free...."
3,"Alien Fairytale, Mocumentary",A mondo film style mocumentary of alien autopsy had seemingly been short in the forties as a part of studying the known Roswell UFO affairs.Funny stuff to watch - not much to study from.The Secret KGB UFO Filesis on topic.
4,Even if its fake it still wakes you up ?,It was like being in the 50 every one at my house was watching it.And i for one only belive in what I feel and have learned at 29 yr old belive in beliveing what is out there is not yet seen.
1,"bosch 1800 4.5 "" angle grinder","unit has ample power and everything seemed ok ?? until cheap plastic, plug in switch, popped out . End has 2 prong with lip like something for a wiring harness ? when it pops out its junked have to send to factory to get fixed . whoever designed that switch is a dummy . Thats is by far the cheapest on off switch I have ever seen . Next grinder will have old style trigger switch , unless of course they stopped making that way because, they were too good ?? Pathetic design flaw . it is now in the trash can"
4,Worth Buying?,"This game is 50 dollars, its a good game to play to be honest very fun. But this game has many downfalls, its only 5-7 hours long and it doesnt have much of a plot, and the ending isnt very good either, this is an awesome rental game but not worth 50 dollars."
1,This is the dummest!,"Please don't watch this unintelligent movie!!!!!! I can't put into words how stupid it is. It may have a few amusing parts but it is all based on crudity and plain stupidity. Why would anyone want to waste their time watching a bunch of stupid and sloppy humans? Good grief, don't we see enough of that in real life? Please, if you're looking for good comedy go with an older, time proven classic. This is one big waste of time! Liberals, people with low I.Q., and politcally correct followers will love this movie! As for the rest of us, skip this brainless movie."
1,You will being seeing spots after this tragedy!,"What kind of a movie would a mentally slow bagger at the local Stop & Shop write, if he could write? 'See Spot Run' is the answer. This tells the story of an idiot who befriends a dog. (...) If you are thinking about having triple by-pass surgery for fun one night, I would suggest that you eat a lardy cheeseburger before it, to try and complicate the process. That experience is more fun than watching this movie."
1,SEE SPOT RUN INTO A HORRIBLE MESS.,"What a crude film,it is gross,silly,crude and rude,and horrible for a ""family"" film.David Arquette embarrases himself as a canine hating mailman,who watches his neighbor's son,then they find a dog who leads them into trouble,but the dog is a FBI drug sniffing dog.Unfunny,moronic,and unpleasent film filled with relentless slapstick,doodoo jokes,and wasted acted talent."
5,Delve into new ground within the realm of pscyhology,"As a Master's candidate studying psychology, I am thrilled to have stumbled upon this book! Finally, some of the ""darker"" areas of the field have been illuminated by a first-hand expert.Written in a conversational tone, this book is safely navigated by the jargon-wary among us, and is entertaining as well as educational. Pick this one up if you have an interest in the fringe movements in psychology, have an open-minded approach to what is considered therapeutic, and/or simply are intrigued by the spiritually enhancing capabilities of psychedelic drugs."
2,i suck and so does this game,"i wrote a review for the other finding nemo game and i gave it 1 star! i dont know what i was thinking to buy this game because the last one was boring and way too easy. this one is no diffrent. it still sucks times 10. but i have to say the graphics are great!A+. BUT the game is still bad and as always i knew my brother would like it! he didnt and his 5. he said ""this game is way too easy and boring. i dont want it.""then he pretented to throw up. my mom didnt like it either. my friends thought they were too old for it because were 10 and my dad said why we bought this junk. so right now its sitting on the shelf dusty. we now have 20 dollars down the drain. stupid nemo and this company, they cant even invent a game that us 10-13 year olds can play."
1,Very unhelpful,"This book was amazingly unhelpful to me. It touches too briefly on too many different aspects of quilt collecting, without going into depth on anything. For example, included is a list of names of common quilt patterns, with no pictures or diagrams to tell you which pattern is which. What pictures there are are black and white and too small to show anything in detail. I'm not sure what kind of expert I'm supposed to be after reading this book, but it's not the kind of expert who knows anything!I would stay away from this book. There are other titles that are much better."
3,Funny yet serious Irish movie,Worth it just for the character Cocoa. He was hilarious and the actor who played him did an excellent job!
4,Didn't work at first,"I bought this without much research. So, it didn't fit my Milwaukee 12"" 6995. Easy fix for this saw. The base for the fence gaurd has a total of four holes. I put threads on the outer left hole and outer right hole. I would suggest to make multiple cuts done at the same time if possible. Otherwise, you're swaping back and forth everytime. I could buy another but I rarely use it. Still a handy thing to have in a pinch."
5,Horse Opera,"This is a great horse opera, as I like to call them. Based on the story of the only surviving member of Custer's last stand. It takes liberties with history but is a great story. I love horses and trained all the horses I owned over the years, the same as the indian did in this film. Watching this movie takes me back to my youth."
1,Designed for Judeo-Christian Homeschoolers,Although the concept of this book is great unfortunately it is clouded by the fact that it 's focus of for those with a Judeo-Christian view. While there is nothing wrong with having a Judeo-Christian background for those uf us who don't hold those views this book won't work for us. It's too bad because for those of you who fall into that group this book would be a great resource.
1,Not worth a buck.,"I read this book and it wasn't worth anyone's money.A brief summary:IntroHere's how to cast a circleBULK OF BOOK: hi, here are the Egyptian godsDon't waste your time. This one's yawn-worthy. I recommend ""The Shamanic Mysteries of ancient Egypt"" here- http://www.amazon.com/Shamanic-Mysteries-Egypt-Awakening-Healing/dp/1591430682/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1352480750&sr;=1-1&keywords;=shamanic+egyptThis latter book linked above has pages on main Neteru, but they also provide meditations to help you create contact with Them. And reading this book helped me understand a lot better than cut-and-dry Egyptian Paganism ever could have tried to."
4,Good Starting Point,"This book is a good starting point in the Egyptian path of Paganism. It presents the basic gods and goddesses as well as information on worship and altar creation. I wouldn't, however, take it as the end all of the pagan path. Personally, I plan on using the references within this book as a starting point in continuing my study.It does use a lot of comparison with other religions. While the Judeo-Christian comparisons stand out because I was raised Catholic, there are also a lot of comparisons to Hindu ideas. I found this helpful in understanding the meaning behind what the author was trying to express."
4,Great sounds from class acts,"This is a great blast back to the 60's easy listening sound. These vocal performances are all among the best of the era. The downside to the whole thing is that the surround mixes sound contrived. In many cases, the original recordings only involved three or four tracks. To manipulate these tracks for 5.1 surround sound takes an act of wizardry. But without enough to work with, there are some problems. For the most part, though, what they were able to do is quite listenable. I do think, however, that it takes more tracks on the original master to make a good, legitimate discrete surround mix."
4,A pretty good record.,"Due to the simplicity of the songs on this record, there is little variation in them. There is some creativity, but nonetheless, the songs all begin to sound the same. Other than this, ""It's Hard to Find a Friend"" is very good. There is a lot of emotion and some lyrics that will cut you to the quick. The music is quite beautiful also."
5,This DVD rocks!,"I love this anime! I watched the first episode and laughed and then the second and laughed even harder, and on and on, I loved every minute of it, I love Magical Girl Anime and out of the many i've seen this definetly on eof my favorites!"
2,Junk,"This product looks very nice, but upon receiving it it is clear that the overall quality is very low. The jewels are, positionally, glued in place sloppily. After a few weeks of my girlfriend wearing it, it broke and is now in the trash. Don't buy."
3,-,"Great show, great songs. What is REALLY annoying is a combination of a few shows. What I wanted to see was one performance. Lets hope that Against All Gods would be released and it would be taken from one concert."
3,Annoying real quick,"I love Manson and i was really looking forward to showing my friends who hadn't seen him live what they were missing. The combinations of the three shows in songs were really annoying and frustrated me very quickly. I want to see just one show like Korn-live, Nine Inch Nails - And All That Could Have Been, or Metallica's S&M where it showcases their energy and you see what their doing the whole time. What made up for this is the odd 30 minute documentary that was filled with backstage clips, interviews, and live footage. Overall i wouldn't recommend this DVD but to only the greatest Manson fans."
2,Firewall support is not like like D-Link Advertises,"All the features work well and are a breeze to setup, except one. This router does all the things you would expect it to in a very stable manner, except one. If you check the D-Link Web site for the manual of this exact router model. You will find some rather nice firewall features (My whole reason for getting this router actually). When you set up the router, you will find that there is no firewall button. It absolutely does not exist. The manual has an actual screen shot of the setup screen with a firewall button in plain view and it details how to use the firewall, but the product came with no such option. I am very disappointed, and feel very mislead."
1,good pictures of nature but little advise,"This book looks beutiful, its a very lovely ornament for the table, but as fore advice and ionformation - it was very dull, and appart from 2-3 gardens, most was just beutiful nature or flower pictures. i was very disapointedMichal"
1,Sure not my experience with this unit....,"Whoa! I'm normally a Bosch tool fan - gots lots of 'em. This brand new one, however, decided to give me three 3/8"" x 4"" pilot holes in cured concrete, then two 5/8"" holes, smoked the motor, and quit on me. All the appropriate precautions (water-cooled bit, moderate pressure, etc.) could not keep this Humpty-Dumpty together. Really disappointing. I pinged Bosch to see what they are willing to do about it since it's over one year old and out of warranty. Will it be the end of my love affair with Bosch tools???"
4,This game got a raw deal!,This game was really fun and innovative when it came out on the PC in 2005. Unfortunately it didn't come out on the PS3 until two years later and was already out-dated by then.It's a really cool game though.
3,Not too bad,"Pros: bit creepy at times, decent graphics, solid single player gameplay, decent story, couple added extra features from the 360 version.Cons: Horrible load times, crappy online, no six axis use.The game was ok, but they could've done a little more. They could've implemented the six axis a little bit, even if only to swing out the butt of the gun when you flick it..just something!..The load times are really horrid as well, by far the longest I have seen on the ps3 yet. (about 90sec load times!)..The graphics are good and if playing late at night, some parts will creep you out a bit. The online definitely needs some work done, just seems too glitchy at this point. All in all, it's just a quick and simple port from the 360 with nothing really extra."
2,PS3 FEAR,"First, I have never played this game on the PC, so I wont be able to compare it to that. Also, I don't own an XBOX 360 and I am not here to compare the merits or shortfalls or either platform. The only other game I can compare it to is Resistacne: Fall of Man. Compared to Resistance this game falls way short of what I wanted. The graphics are WAY SUB PAR for the PS3 and almost embarrasing when compared to Resistance. The levels are confusing and the enemies are predictable. I was really excited to get this game and have been horribly dissapointed. If the graphics were up to snuff I could tolerate it, but I felt like I was playing a PS2 game. Unless you loved the PC version, save your money."
2,Not worth it!!!,I borrowed this game from someone out here and I'm sad to say that I have brought all three ports for the pc and was blown away how each game was a step up from the last but when I got my hands on this one just to see the difference I was shocked and let down but I also have to remember that this game was debuted on the pc first and that was almost a few years ago but expecting some of the bugs to be cleaned up at lest for the ps3 would have been nice but got let down on some of the graphics which were no better on my pc which loaded faster and played better. Truly this was my first let down on the ps3 and I hope that its the last.
5,An outstanding exposition of a country destroyed by mediocre minds,This is the diary of an outstanding thinker who is amazed at how his nation can be brought to utter destruction by leaders with no more wit or intelligence than you average middle school bully.
1,poorly made,I purchased this table from another vendor--the table top was welded poorly and tilted down at such an angle when it was put together that anything you set on it would fall off. It also does not support nearly the weight that it is listed to support. The table bounced up and down easily if you put any pressure on the table top. I promptly returned this table.
3,Works fine.,I'm certainly not an expert on these utensils. I purchased a number of these in different sizes. Was smaller than it appears in photos. Very light weight. Seems to hold up in dishwasher. Overall not overly impressed though it gets the job done. Might purchase again.
1,Uggg,"Well, I have to say I'm wondering who the talent behind Toad the Wet Sprocket was because it's not Glen Phillips. I wanted to throw this out the car window after listening to the first half. The lyrics and music are simplistic and somewhat reaching for Country Music without ever achieving that either. If you are a Toad fan, I would caution you before buying this disk."
2,The story was drowned in scientific complexity,"Hal Clement is very well known for his hard SF. In ""Mission of gravity"" (1954), he managed to write a story that combined an interesting storyline with good and comprehensible science. In the current book, he lacks both a clear storyline and comprehensible science. It is possible the science is comprehensible for a graduate in biochemistry, but I doubt it. If not intended to be a textbook, it shouldn't be that complex. The story is, though based on some interesting ideas, completely wasted in too many details."
2,"Too much science, not enough fiction","All put this was an excellent book. It was well-written, and had many, many very interesting and intriguing ideas. Unfortunately, it was all bogged down with so much high-profile science and sometimes tedious flight scenes.Don't get me wrong: no author I've ever read has made science fiction more convincing, or technically correct, or has presented a truly foreign planet (or moon, in this case) as well as Hal Clement does in this book.But if you're looking for an interesting *story*, look elsewhere. As a scientific exploration of xenobiology, chemistry, methane-based-atmosphere-aerodynamics, and planetography, Half Life has no competitor. Unfortunately, underneath all this science (for which you almost need a degree in chemistry to have the hopes of grasping), there just isn't a real story lurking."
1,totaly unreadable - clement should be demoted to novice rank,"if you know what the term ""half life"" mean then you may read this book on you'r own risk, else don't bother. this book is so hard core - it hard as a rock. i couldn't lift this rock - it was to heavy for me.advice for clement - you don't have to use all the space in a page, you can leave some spaces, and write short paragraphs, and try to be considered to the reader - he doesn't understand most of the science stuff you talk about.p.s - when you buy a book try to see if there are good revies about it on the back cover - on this book there weren't any reviwes at all, what says it all."
5,Great but check the compatability list,"I bought one, set it up in just minutes, did a firmware upgrade and was all set to go, but ONE major problem ... My d-link router and ranger extender do not communicate. I checked the product support page and found out that they are not compatable. So, I'll sell mine and get the right one.CHECK THE LABELS BEFORE PURCHASE, but this is an AWESOME TOOL"
2,Imcompatible with Dlink DI-713P in repeater mode,"This DWL-800AP+ is a good idea: AP and repeater in one unit.The price is great.But check AP compatibility before you buy if you intent to use it in repeater mode. I found out the hard way that it does NOT work with many Dlink APs. For example, it does not work with my new Dlink DI-713P. However, it works with my older 1000AP.Dlink pre-sale support gave me the wrong info that it works with DI-713P. Dlink after-sale tech support spent 30 min. to discover the compatibility problem. I feel like I am beta testing products for Dlink."
5,Works even better with an external antenna,"Just an addendum to my previous review. Attaching an external ""range extender"" antenna signifcantly increases the range. Now I get an excellent signal in the park next door."
1,"Repeater mode doesn't work, support is garbage","The repeater mode fails to connect after one day and requires resetting. Technical support gave me the runaround, making many suggestions that did not apply to the problem. It took three telephone calls to obtain an RMA.I will NEVER EVER EVER buy a D-Link product for the REST OF MY LIFE!!Garbage. Don't buy. They are morons, and their 800AP+ is a peice of garbage."
5,My Favorite Childhood Tearjerker,"Even at 39, the end of this story brings me to tears....a sweet and wonderful book that I delight in sharing with my own little girl.A wonderful holiday story with a very happy ending."
2,Thin stuff,"I picked this up after reading a brief review in the NYT Book Review. The premise sounded good, but the book is oddly flat. The writers, with one exception, never really distinguish themselves enough to take on unique voices. The instructor is too stale a character--more a stereotype than anything else. I think if I knew who Carter was lampooning here, the satire would have a little more bite, but as it stands, the novel's ""humor"" feels too routine.The brief discussions of famous writers, experimental fiction, and genre fiction are wafer thin. This novel is as experimental as testing PH with pink strips of paper. But who, really, is going to read something more challenging in a popular novel?Still, I read to the end, which may say more about my commitment than it does the novel. There's just not a lot of meat on these bones."
4,You have alternatives ...,"This tool has to be the whole arsenal for you.If you are like me, and have an occasional demo job to do in order to move a drain, or tear up a bathroom, it's fine.But this is an expensive thing to have around: it takes up plenty of space, it operates as if it's a real jackhammer (it's big) but it does NOT have close to the breaking power of a pneumatic device, so be forewarned.As a good alternative, you might try renting a Hilti 905. The Hilti let's you get more ""down"" on your project.If you have a basement floor to tear up, or something outside, don't think you have to do everything yourself. Find a guy who is used to breaking concrete and see if you can make an arrangement with him to be a pair of hands and get him in economically, if that's your deal.If your concrete is an outside job, just bring in a skidsteer or rent a bobcat: this guy isn't about that.Remember you are likely going to be facing rebar, and this guy doesn't like rebar."
5,Easier just became faster!,"Hi, I have owned a Visor Delux and it was only natural for me to upgrade to Neo. It has all the essential feauters that you need and they are twice as fast as before! Visors always did everything that they were supposed to do RIGHT.. this only does it FASTER. The look and feel is exactly the same as visor delux, however the case is clear plastic that tends to smudge more than the granular surfaced deluxe (this requires more care).BottomLine: If you want GREAT value for money, with a PDA that will do exactly what you expect it to, then buy this. If you want you PDA to do tricks.. well buy a [better] PDA or better buy an expansion module! There isnt a better gift for your hardworking and smart, significant other! =)"
5,"terrible cover and title, very good book","author communicates the spirit, attitude, purpose, philosphy and techniques of yoga. I have read several yoga books and this is by far my favorite. The cover and title make it look suitable for a supermarket check out stand but I assure you this is a very serious and insightful work. That cover-title thing is distressing. It's like the publisher never read the book."
5,One of the best purchases I've made on Amazon,"This thing is AWESOME. Powerful, efficient, and a true work horse. So far, I have drilled no less than 1,000 1/2"" diameter holes about 6"" deep, and this thing hasn't skipped a beat. Couldn't find a better price anywhere, so Amazon came through again!"
5,Bosch-Enough Said,It's a work horse!! Fast and easy. Cant live without it now. Thanks Bosch--Another Great tool
1,It's Fake,I have use this brand before. First of all the label on this product is a facsimil in black and white of the colorfull original. While the ambient smell in original lasts for hours in this dissapears in minutes. As said IT IS FAKE.
1,FAKE,"Fake product, looks different than picture, homemade label. Do not buy this product. If I read other reviews I will know before I waste my money."
1,There are better alternatives,"I tested this camera, and if you don't need the built-in audio support, the AXIS 2100 Network Camera is the industry standard and a better choice. Considerable better image quality, especially at lower light conditions, and at the same price. If you want even better functionality and performance Axis also has a professional series of surveillance network cameras, (but are at least twice as expensive)."
3,This book was good but not very exciting!!,"It showed how life was back then and what Zoe did to get rid of the Northern soldiers, but it didn't have much else. It was sort of boring."
3,Forgot to caution against muggers,"The book provides fine lists of places to stay and visit, but fails to caution against the muggers. I was violently mugged, drug through the street and choked by my purse strap until my partner smashed a full beer can into the guy's head. This happended less than one block from our hotel off La Rambla in Barcelona. Stories like this were common from others in our hotel and from those we have told about it since. Beware in Barcelona! day or night!"
4,For Maigret Afficionados,"A man is found knifed in a Paris Alley. He is wearing ""goose dung"" brown shoes and not the black shoes he had on when he left home for work that morning. Thus begins ""Maigret and the Man on the Bench"".During the long career of Georges Simenon, he published more than 200 novels and had more than 500 million copies of his books in print. When Georges Simenon is on, his Maigret stories are simply brilliant. When he is not at his best, the novels are merely good. This is a good novel that I would recommend for devotees of the Maigret mystery novels. I would not recommend the book for a first time Maigret reader. There are better novels with which to become aquainted with the venerable Jules Maigret."
3,PREDICTABLE BUT STILL ENTERTAINING,"An ex marine takes the challenging position as an English teacher at a tough inner city school where she confronts raucous students who don't want to learn. Not as good as i'd expected with the casting of the capable Michelle Pfieffer in the leading role but is defintley worth a look and at best can be described as entertaining, with a few interesting sub plots along the way. Its not really origanal with its typical fantasy, feel good factor about the tough being tamed, but boasts some good performances and some scenes are genuinley moving. Purley judged on its own merits, its good and worth a look. Recommended."
1,doesnt play at all,This dvd does not play at all..blank disc did not play on any dvd player..or nintendo system or computer.. Not happy tht i lost my $$
5,anon,"This book is wonderful, I read through it before I took the physics test, and I scored 770 on the second try! My first one was only 660. It is great not because it gives a lot of concepts but it presents real SAT II-like questions in the practice tests. you have to use your concepts to solve them."
5,Very good!,"This is probably one of the very best of Michael Gielen's highly acclaimed Mahler recordings (now available as a complete set). As is strikingly obvious when listening to his interpretation, Gielen has a ""modernist"" approach to the work, emphasizing its extreme kaleidoscopic character. His grasp of the third movement is here particularly successful, I think. But all the five movements are convincingly presented, and very detailed as well. This is not only due to the outstanding recording quality and the superb orchestral playing. It is also due to Gielen's analytic but passionate interpretation of the work, which outshines most rivals in the market.The disc is a must have for all Mahlerite connoisseurs. But it also can be recommended even for those who want just one splendid studio recording of this work."
2,Real men don't use blades,"It's a decent enough read, but what bugged me in comparison to true classics like Hoolifan, Congratulations You Have Just Met The ICF and Good Evening Gentlemen, The Name's Bill Gardner is that this author's mob was famous for blade use and he talks endlessly about cutting and slashing other unarmed fighters. Even better, when on ocasion another firm would retaliate and cut back, his firm would go mental and act as if that was the worst crime on earth. Hey scally, at least go toe-to-toe, bro, fist to fist. Gardner didn't use knives. Anything less and you have NOTHING to brag about. You relied on blades against people without them, that's weak and not worthy of a story, end of chat, no back answers."
2,review of *similar* model,"Review of a similar Soehnle scale, not this one.Worked brilliantly for two years, then became inaccurate, unable to be zero'd or read a consistent weight. New batteries didn't help. These aren't cheap scales; they should be reliable for years."
1,not the right one!,"Beware, there are two different Mr Coffee Stainless steel 10 cup thermal carafes. I could only find this one when searching and it doesn't fit the Mr Coffee makerMr. Coffee BVMC-PSTX91 Optimal Brew 10-Cup Thermal CoffeemakerUnfortunately, Mr Coffee doesn't even have the correct replacement carafe. This carafe might be fine, but make sure you aren't buying it for the above mentioned coffeemaker."
3,The Mushroom Cultivator: A Practical Guide to Growing Mushrooms at Home,"Way toooooo technical. But if you are so inclined, there is probably nothing as appropriate. This is for the person who is a fanatic about scientific details."
4,good starter book,"This book does give you a lot of basic information. However, ""Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms"" would probably be a better choice if you intend on trying to grow mushrooms."
5,One of the Greatest,This is one of the greatest albums of any genre. The poetry is outstanding and so is the gospel music. You will listen to this work over and over again.
1,"Neither ""organizing"" nor ""simplicity""","I was disappointed with this book. There were a few worthwile tips (such as going to bed early to take advantage of the more productive morning hours) but mostly the author solved her problems by throwing money at them. If I could pick anywhere in the country I wanted to live, buy $700 coats and hire people to run all my errands, hey, I'd be organized too! As for ""simplicity""....there is nothing here that anyone with even a passing familiarity with the simplicity movement would recognize."
2,Hard to Process,I find that this book is extremely hard to work through. The reading takes so long that it is hard to get other work done and by the time you are finished you have to go back through the material to really understand what you had just read.
4,PhD Student,This book is well written and provides clear and concise description regarding basic to advanced statistical techniques. The book provides excellent examples applicable to the health care industry. Good selection.
2,Completely inadequate,"I was extremely disappointed in this map, which is incomplete, inadequate and even inaccurate in spots. If you're a casual tourist who is only spending a day in the Bavarian capital, then this map would probably fit your basic needs. But if you're planning on spending a week or more in the city, or if you want to see more than the city center, then avoid the map at all costs.The map shows only the inner city, with few streets shown beyond Briennerstrasse or the Isar. This is simply not acceptable, especially if you want to see anything of the city beyond Marienplatz. There is also some outdated information on the reverse, giving U Bahn stations on the wrong cross streets. This could present clear problems for travelers. I do not recommend this map to anyone unless you're restricting yourself to a small area in the pedestrian-only zone."
3,Review,"I recently became aware of this author. I started with another of her novels then picked this one up partly because of the subject, but also because of the great character development in the other novel. This is an interesting novel, the plot is believable, but but not her best effort."
1,Shoulda read Amazon first,"Bought the 4-port model of this card on the bay-of-E without checking Amazon for reviews -- ugh, exactly what you've read in the reviews on the 2-port model here apply there too. Didn't come with the driver disk, but DriverGuide has the file; insert and the computer recognises the card and adds the hubs but they do nothing, and nothing plugged into the card is recognised. Am seeking RMA or exchange for a different brand.Pardon that this review isn't specifically about the model here and card wasn't purchased on Amazon, but I'm reinforcing the warning others have given here: the disapproval rating for Micro Innovations USB 2.0 PCMCIA cards needed to hit 80% and as always /caviat emptor/."
2,not all its cracked up to be,"I am a contractor and have used this saw extensively the past 2 years. It replaced its predecessor but has not held up like the first. It's been in the shop a few times for the quick change breaking, and now is having a motor problem that is going to need fixing. The variable speed has also stopped working. It's been small items but they add up. The power has been more than ample, the disconnect cord is very useful, but I'm not sure I'm going to stick with Milwaukee this time."
4,A taut thriller with Middle East intrigue,"DiCaprio, Crowe, and director Ridley Scott are in top form with this story of espionage, suicide bombers, and the intricate webs woven by all involved. The casualties of war in various forms are shown throughout the story. Be aware that some scenes are hard to watch due to human suffering, but that is one of the costs of these wars."
4,Good action and plot,Performance by Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio were stellar as usual. The movie is packed with action and a plot that keeps your attention throughout.
2,"Meh. Could Have Been Good, but Stumbles Badly","The easiest way to summarize it is not smart enough to be Syrianna and the action didn't compare to The Kingdom.It sort of attempts to do both and comes up neither.That, and a muddled storyline don't help. I'm not sure what to make of it other than the so-what ideas that: a) there's plenty of jihadists that hate us and will kill us no matter what and b) we've done plenty throughout history to incite this kind of behavior. Not exactly a newsflash.What is also completely distracting is Crowe's first peformance ever where I didn't buy it. He's so completely superficial and they pound home the point that Leo's in the desert getting shot at while Crowe shuttles his kids to school plays, conducting war via cellphone. Not exactly subtle.DiCaprio is solid but hardly able to save this mess. Far more superior are the aforemetioned Syriana or The Kingdom, if you want to see DiCaprio in a political action thriller that does hit on all cylinders, try Blood Diamond."
2,Your worst enemy is your own boss,"DiCaprio is a spy. The greatest dangers he faces are not the terrorists but his boss, a gung-ho glory jockey played by Russell Crowe, and Crowe's rival for the command post, a stereotypical brain-dead but obstinately arrogant bureaucrat that the civil services breed like rats. No matter what happens, it is only a matter of time before DiCaprio gets screwed.DiCaprio wants to establish trust with the anti-terror unit he works with, so he can eventually nail the top terrorists. But Crowe is too impatient, and will take any risk, abuse any relationship and burn any asset for a quick result that he can show off to the big boss to boost his career, even if it means getting his own agents killed.It is a very revealing look at how a US agency works, very realistic and a great eye-opener. But the plot gets muddled and the ending is a bit anti-climatic."
5,Stunning,"When I was first researching this watch, I was thinking to myself, damn, I don't know about this, it looks kind of sketchy. The $25 shipping in the event that the watch should not meet up to your standards. This is my first automatic watch, so I have no other way to compare to any other watches. It looks a lot better in real life than anything on youtube or on the amazon images. All I can say is that I really don't mind if it slows down or speeds up, because I'll only be using this watch while attending formal events with very important people. Just a dress watch nothing more. It looks sicko! Thanks Amazon!"
1,"Good watch, but its the luck of the draw","Upon positive reviews from other amazon reviewers and one of my friends who had ordered an Invicta in the past, I decided to purchase this watch.It arrived in the packaging, and was everything it was made out to be: excellent finish and build quality. Unfortunately it was a big too large for my wrist and had to pay to get it sized properly.Once that was done however, some of the pins began dropping out, so I had to take it back to have it looked at. At this point I'm still not sure if it was the watch sizer's fault, or a fault with the watch.However after this the seconds hand stopped turning, and would 'hit' the minute hand and not be able to move anymore, despite the watch keeping perfect time.So in the end had to return it to Amazon, which did a fantastic job of the return imo.So verdict, Invicta watches are a steal and look great, if you get the lucky one that was manufactured well!"
4,Great Watch esp. for the price,"Have used my watch for a few weeks on a trip to Hawaii. Dove twice to 70 ft and was in and out of water with it several times with no leaking. Nice looking watch that gets some attention. Sort of heavy, but not bad.Great watch for outdoor water enthusiast."
1,cheap crap,stopped working 3 minutes after taking it out of the boxthe seconds hand stops by the 22 markwhat a waste of money!!
3,Good make - deceptive origin,"The watch is brand new, but I was disappointed because of the way its producer advertises it. Invicta is a Swiss brand, but this watch is made is Japan with Japan movement, not Swiss. The disappointing thing is that this origin is not revealed in any of the producer's advertisement or catalogue, except on the face of the watch as I received. I consider this deceptive and confusing."
2,Poor quality control,"This is the second Invicta watch I purchased that was defective. In this case, the automatic movement began working (after some initial winding) but I was surprised to see that it had stopped in the middle of the day (while wearing it). I cranked it up and again, it stopped after a couple of hours. This pattern continued to repeat before I finally decided to return it for a refund. Yes, its a nice looking watch (if a common and tired design) and is sold for a great price, but I'm now quite skeptical of Invicta's quality. I had previously purchased the very similar (but smaller) style #8932 from another store and it had the same issues of running for a while, then stopping. Which was even more surprising in that case since it was a battery-powered quartz movement (battery replacement was no help). So I guess if you are one of the lucky ones to get a good unit you have a real bargain - if not, you may be out of luck and late for your appointment!"
2,Unreliabe watch,"This is a beautiful watch, and I would have given it a five star rating if it had not been for the following: it was purchased about two years ago. I only wear it during overseas or hunting trips. It has been in actual use no more than ten weeks. About two weeks ago, the last time I wore it, it stopped working, reset the time several times and each time it just stopped working. In contrast I have had another automatic watch of another brand for over twenty years and it has never had this problem."
1,Stay away from these watches!,"STAY AWAY FROM THESE WATCHES, and this company! Yes, their watches are cheap, but that is because they are shoddy! Invicta makes poor-quality watches, and their customer service is absolutely atrocious! My watch, that is supposedly water resistant, stopped working in normal humid weather. I never wore it swimming or in water. The customer service department is very difficult to deal with, and mystery charges appear for things that should be covered by the warranty ($28 flat-rate shipping, except internationally, which is $75, etc). I was asked to give private credit card information over a normal email, which is unprofessional and unsafe. Please, don't make the same mistake I did, and think twice before buying one of their products."
1,Supermodel with osteoporosis,"It looks good, thats just about it!The watch itself feels like kid toys made in china that is going to fall apart anytime soon.The band feels like a cheap hollow tin can.When I read some positive amazon reviewers, they all says how heavy it is. but its way lighter compare to my cheap casio watch.It looks good because its rolex wanna-be, and thats about what you get for $90......Rolex looks.This will likely be my last invicta (who?) purchase.....Thanks Amazon for your fast shipping."
2,Stopped working after 9 months,"My wife bought this watch for me as a Christmas gift two years ago. By the next Christmas, I had sent it in for repair three times. The first two times they told me nothing was wrong and that it only needed cleaning. Finally, it completely stopped working and someone actually tried to fix it. I've had enough of Invicta. There are some better options available with better customer service."
5,Awesome watch for a great price!,This is a great watch and at an amazing price. I will definitely be buying more Invicta's from Amazon.
3,"Good Watch, but Very Poor Customer Service","I've had my Invicta for 2 years, and paid for the extended 5 year warranty. It has been a good watch; nice looking and durable. In the last few months however, my screws started falling out one by one and now I only have one out of the four that I need. I tried contacting Invicta, and like others, I tried 4-5 times before getting through. They told me twice that they would ship the screws, but never did. After two months of waiting, I decided to write them a letter only to get a postcard back saying I needed to mail the watch in, at my expense, and pay $20 for them to ship it back. How frustrating??!! I don't need it serviced, I only need 3 little screws that are probably worth $.50 that never should have fallen out in the first place. If you buy an Invicta, pray that you'll never need it serviced!"
5,Excellent watch,"I've owned this watch for about a year and half. I'm a highly critical consumer; I rarely feel I get my money's worth for products I purchase. This watch is an exception to that. It's excellent in every regard. It keeps very good time. It's workmanship and finish are higher end--It just looks and feels like a very good, higher-priced watch. I'm not a factory worker or construction worker sort, but I'd say I've given this watch a fair amount of abuse and it still looks almost brand-new. A year and a half of wearing it and there are NO scratches on the mineral crystal, no scratches on the rotating bezel, and only minimal wear on the band. It's comfortable to wear.If I had a complaint, it would be that the magnifer bubble thing is not only unnecessary, but actually gets in the way of reading the face of the watch.For the price, you won't be disappointed with this watch."
5,Great deal on a great looking watch.,"This is a stellar watch for the price. It's elegant and functional, and for my purposes the scalloped edge (as opposed to the coin edge) functions better as a dress watch for me at work; more smooth surfaces are preferable! I'm never going to go diving with this thing, it's purely in the category of ""man jewelry."" I can't yet speak about the longevity of this watch, but from an economic standpoint, I'm not going to worry much if it gets too beat up."
1,"Looks are deceiving, don't waste your money on Invicta","I purchased the 8926 Pro Diver Watch back in December 2011 and it stopped working just 7 months later. It's a good looking watch, but the quality is terrible. Furthermore, Invicta's warranty is a less than desirable. You have to pay them $27 plus S&H to send the watch to them and I've heard horror stories of people not receiving their watches back for up to 3 months. There are countless complaints on the web about Invicta. If I had to do it all over again, I'd stick with a brand name you can trust and stay away from Invicta."
2,"Looks Great.. However, does not work","What a shame, looked great, felt great, however, when I went to set date and time, could not set date. Its being sent back, and I decided to spend more for a Orient and hopefully get something that works."
5,Invicta pro diver great watch,"What a deal, I am very pleased with this watch. The place I took it to for fitting repairs high end watches, rolex etc... He stated this watch should sell for at least $350. He was very impressed. The feel of the watch is great, heavy and sturdy. Movement is nice and was also complimented by the watch repair man. All in all I can't believe this was purchased for $85. I recommend this watch to all that are looking for a great high end watch without spending 1000 or more."
4,Invicta watch is great but seller issues,"I ordered the watch more than a month ago from famous watch, and received tracking info accordingly.I was tracking the package and the tracking info claimed the watch had arrived.I contacted seller and waited finally they decided to resend a new watch.I'm thankful that i didn't wait to last minute to order and can now give it as a holiday present.the watch itself is great, looks amazing and to see the movement in the back is nice.sometimes, i find myself staring at the movement for hours.just kidding.lolThe only down fall I've noticed is light weighted metal band not sure of quality but to get adjusted was difficult for watch shop as the pins are think like wire.but for a watch such as this seems well rounded for the price tag.much better than Fossil or similar companies at the same price.would recommend for everyday wear:style can go with suit or jeans and tee. not for those with more money than brains and status of Rolex."
1,Beautiful wrist band.,"I agree with most of the reviewers that it's a beautiful piece. It could be called a beautiful Wrist band rather than a watch. Mine stops every day or every other day and needs a reset every other day. It's build quality is very good and appointments are beautiful but not the performance.""Shame on Invicta that it can't built a watch in 21st century""."
5,Great Watch,"I purchased this watch approx. a month and a half ago and I am extremely pleased with the purchase. When I ordered it, it was $70 and since then, the price has risen. However, if you pay under $100 for this watch, it is a great deal. The added bonus is that it's an automatic. Some people have complained about losing time when they take it off for the evening. My watch has not lost any time at all. The only time it has stopped is when i had not worn it in a couple of days which is understandable being automatic.As for the look and size of the watch, it's perfect. I cannot afford the higher end watches (yet), but the look and feel of this one really measures up! My boss, who has multiple high end watches, was also very impressed with this watch. People who do not know any better assume that this watch cost me hundreds and are shocked when i tell them $70. I can not stop raving about this one. Worth every penny..."
2,Get what you pay for...,"Is $85 too good to be true? Sadly, yes. The pictures look great for this watch, but once you actually inspect it in your hands, it doesn't hold up. First off, the ""cyclops"" magnifier on the crystal hardly magnifies at all. I don't know what the specs are on this, but the date font looks as if it gets enlarged by 15% tops.The worst part of this watch is the bracelet. Again, it looks pretty in the pictures, but it feels tinny, light, and cheap once you feel it in your hands.Basically, this watch is worth $85, and if that's what you were looking for, that's great. I was expecting something more Rolex-like-- a heavier weight and more functional date magnifier. If you're looking to get a better value, I'd check out the Seiko monster."
2,Reasonable watch for its price but....,Got this watch last week WELL .. this is has a power reserve of like what ? 12hrs ? Because I am sure if I did not wear this watch for just 1 day the watch would stop. That really gets on my nerves. And I did not know that this watch is using a Japanese Movement as amazon did not state that down. What can I say for the price what would I expect ? Swiss movement .. wishful thinking I guess.
3,"Not bad watches...not great, but not bad.","Not bad watches...not great, but not bad. I have two Invicta watches. Here is what you need to know about Invicta's Automatic Watches. They look great, great selection of styles, and the price is right. The problem is the automatic movements do not keep great time. If you wear them over night they are pretty accurate, but not perfect. If you take them off during the night, no matter how you set them down, they gain or loose time and you have to reset them in the morning. I have one that gains time and one that looses time....go figure? So, if you don't mind adjusting the time of your watch daily, they are a good looking, inexpensive, fair quality watch."
1,Buyer BEWARE,"I ordered this watch as a Christmas gift for my husband. By mid-January, it stopped working. Invicta said the warranty would cover the repairs but that the watch had to be sent overseas so we had to ship it to Invicta with a check for $30 to cover shipping costs. When Invicta received the watch, they said it would be JULY 15 before it was returned---some 5 months after it was sent. July 15 has now come and gone; still no watch. In fact, customer service has failed to respond to multiple emails since July 1 requesting the status of the watch. This has to be the WORST product and service I have ever encountered. I would never recommend an Invicta product to anyone. BUYER BEWARE!"
3,"It gains time, it's not as robust as I expected","Pros: It looks nice. I like the no battery feature. (Although I can hear it winding, which freaks me out.)Cons: It gains about 2 minutes per week. The clasp feels weak, and the black ring around the face of the watch is loose and pivots back & forth like a see-saw. When I push down around the 1:00 time location, it pushes towards the watch and you can hear it move.I'm not crazy about the watch. This is my first ""nice"" watch, and I think I'll stick with the cheap watches from now on."
4,Great Deal,"I had an issue with the watch band coming off in shipping(or wasn't put on all the way at the factory, but it was minor, and the watch far outways the issue.Excellent watch.Really excellent price.Arrived on time and as described."
3,"Reloj muy bonito, pero pesimo brazalete","Hola,Este reloj es muy bonito pero el brazalete deja mucho que desear, la calidad se nota que no es muy buena se ve barato y aparte hace demasiado ruido, con un mejor brazalete este reloj seria una obra de arte."
5,The Invicta 8926 Automatic watch,"This is overall one of the best watches I have owned. It is well made with a heavy feeling and has solid not hollow links in the band. I love its automatic mechanical movement because there is never a need to worry about batteries in a quartz, it just winds itself with the movement of your wrist or if its been sitting for a couple of days simply wind it with the crown. It came from the shipping company DHL within about two weeks which seemed long but it was free shipping so in the end it was all good, it came in a nice yellow leather feeling case with instruction manual and polishing cloth and watch sitting on a felt holder to keep its shape. If you are shopping for a watch with great quality and a very good price this is the best choice. you won't be disapointed with Invictas products. I am wearing it right now and i just like how pretty it is. Buy it !"
4,8926 crystal,I would like to order the 8926 but am confused about the crystal material. The Amazon info says it is 'mineral' and the Invicta website says it is the newer scratch resistant flame fusion crystal. If I order today will it by the new flame fusion crystal?
2,Works just as described. . . for a while,"I purchased this item and found it both easy to install and that it worked just as described. I found no problems with ""brittle metal"". With a couple turns of the knob in a counter-clockwise direction my battery is completely disconnected. Tightening the knob reconnects the battery simply and quickly.***UPDATE***Well, after about 16 months I started having issues with my car dying at lights (intermittently) and a couple issues with the car not starting. I was able to isolate the issue to this part. I replaced it with one from a different manufacturer and I am back in business. Original rating- 5 stars New rating- 2 stars. Such a simple part should not break or wear out in 16 months. Too bad, the design is very convenient."
5,Great Saw!,"This is an amazing saw. I've had it for 5 years, and it's still running like new. Plenty of power, smooth operation, comfortable, well-balanced, cuts great, etc. Absolutely no complaints. When this wears out I'm definitely getting another Milwaukee."
2,Not funny enough,"to pull off a story line based around him ""downloading"" ""all the secrets"" to his brain."
4,Farewell to a much loved show!,"Since we have the other seasons on DVD I bought this on DVD not Blue-Ray. We loved this show but I do think they were smart in ending it when they did. Overall, I'm glad we have this just to have the complete series. I liked season 4 better but did enjoy this season as well."
5,Brilliant start!,"Fun characters, smile-inducing dry humor without going for corny laughs, and some very cool action put this show off to an excellent start. As a lead-in for Heroes, I think NBC may have a hit on their hands."
5,"CHUCK SEASON 5, Closure??","What can I say, Chuck was one of the greatest well written shows EVER! Just finsihed Season 5 last night! Now I know why people are saying what they are saying about this season of Chuck! Let me be the first to say, it was because of the ending of the show that people probably didnt like! To see what Sarah had become near the end was hard on Chuck fans because we all loved the character of Sarah! It kind of left you with a question of is that it? Our Chuck and Sarah going to be happy together? I dont want to ruin anything for anyone, but I feel that the ending was meant to be left to your imagination! The true Chuck fans know what I mean!But Thank you for 5 great years of Chuck! Chuck and Sarah FOREVER!"
2,Cheap quality,I love the Chuck television show but the picture quality of of these discs is terrible. They seem like the cheap bootleg DVDs that are made in China and sold on the street. I feel that I was cheated and I will not purchase another product from this seller. I guess that is what I get for trying to save a buck.
3,It's all about 'tone'...,"Now this is truly one frustrating show. One the one hand the plot is great; a nerd becomes the unwilling receipant of his college arch-rival's secret computer files which lodge INSIDE HIS HEAD and he must work with a hot secret agent to solve crimes for which he (said nerd) in entirely unsuited for. Now, the actors are great. And the story moves along at a nice clip. And director McG has a good time (and I suspect thinks he's pretty cool, and I'm sure all the producers in Hollywood tell him he is cool, I mean, he did direct the feature Charlie's Angels) but in the end, this is not a good show. Why? The tone is off. It's just too 'wink, wink' and doesn't believe enough in the world it's telling so everything (like Charlie's Angels) doesn't quite work...but almost does. It's too silly and not very good in the end. It's like he wants Alias meets a very silly (and not very clever) Marx Brothers."
2,2 stars for this,i would have givin it one if it wasnt for the song stay tuned/i have lidtend to this cd about 15 times since i got it because i thought something was good about it. i was right her voice is the only nice thing going on here!
4,"Where the Green Revolution failed, golf may succeed","A brilliant study of how the ancient social and technical aspects of water management systems in Bali, inextricably bound with nature and religion, undermined the Green Revolution in the 1980s. Highly recommended"
5,A word to guitarists:,"This cd is groundbreaking in an aspect that hasn't yet been referred to: the union of the more frantic 'Mahavishnu' type soloing ,(McLaughlin, DiMeola) with a more relaxed, blues inflected style,(Clapton,Allman), from Bolin. Up until this moment the two soloing styles had been at odds with each other; the fusion guys thinking the blues-rock guys weren't ambitious enough, the blues guys thinking the fusion guys weren't soulful enough. Bolin was the man for the job of unifying the styles, combining a relaxed bluesy vibrato with chops to spare; still the hallmark of the best modern soloists."
2,TOO MANY BAD PRACTICES,"First of all, this book has almost nothing to do with OOP. It has some useful tidbits, such as using custom (server) controls to reduce coding and to increase standardization.However, I cannot recommend this title because of the many poor practices and bad application design it advocates. Why Microsoft Press doesn't insist it's title have some consistency in the use of naming standards, coding standards, application design, etc., is beyond me.The application design is poor or maybe the examples are just poorly done. The business layer doesn't appear to enforce any business rules while the data-access layer is also unconventially designed.Only one-third of this book (regarding server controls and UI design) is of any use. The rest is just junk."
2,MISNAMED AND NOT PARTICULARLY USEFUL,"Is ""junk"" too harsh a term for this book? Yes and no.Some of it is very useful, but the majority of the book isn't--particularly the architectural guidelines. I realize there can be more than one way to do things. This book, however, takes a very different path towards getting things done and doesn't seem to fit with the recommended design and architectural guidelines from other Microsoft Press titles.If you are new to distributed programming, this might be an eye-opener for you. However, be prepared to take the road less traveled if you following this book. If you're experienced in distributing programming, you will likely disagree with how the application is designed.For example, why aren't type datasets used? Perhaps there is a good reason for this, but it isn't in the book.I agree with the first reviewer--some of the book is quite useful, the REST is junk."
5,Very romantic and beautiful music...,"The movie ""Intersection"" now is some old. The remake of french movie THE THINGS OF LIFE. The exellent actors performance - Richard Gere, Sharon Stone, Lolita Davidovich making it very lovely. From the first sounds of this soundtrack you feel something eternity. Music by James Newton Hovard very soft and carefully lead us to thinking about our life. If you feel sad, listen this disk and feel yourself better."
5,Mama Mia! What excellent pizza!,"Why do the people in the picture look so grossed out? It's just pizza! Sure, it may be a little unusual because of its soupy texture and weird assortment of condiments, but it's always good to try something new!"
3,Fun but not at all realistic,"One son (9) chose this as a present for his little brother's birthday (6) to complement the fake poop he got. Fake poop was great; this was not. While they were excited at first, the boys haven't wanted to play with it as it is not realistic and they don't think they can prank anyone with it."
1,stupid looks fake wonm't fool anyone,"I put it in my mouth made throw up sounds and spit it out so when they came around the couch and saw it on the floor thought they might fall for it but nobody did,....ti was obviously fake looking. not worht a penny. don't buy it"
3,good but ive seen better,"this movie has many flaws, first of all the charcters seemd to unrealistic and almost fantasy like. The silo killer has the most pansy like punches I have ver seen. The ending was a no brainer, anyone who couldnt figure it out most not be very inteligent. The only reason I liked this movie was because of the Billy Hill charcter. the only reason I bothered to watch this movi because it was released by a company which released my favorite movie Meet the febbles."
1,More Overdone Emo Wailing,"Angela Aki's claim to fame is her half-and-half heritage, which allows her to screech her cliched, trite lyrics about the same old relationship/feeling/love topics in two languages. In Japan, banging on a piano and tonelessly hollering in Japanese is good enough for a few months' fame, Angela shamelessly exploits her whiteness to score points with a country still obsessed with ANYTHING American/Western. In the US, she wouldn't rate a small-town karaoke club, but in Japan, knowing English and Japanese makes for serious sales at the ticket office.This entire CD is forgettable and bears no repetition. I returned my rented copy immediately after the CD finished and I wanted to write to the music company and demand compensation for the wasted time.In the US, we already have Tori Amos, who sings and plays MUCH better than Angela. I suppose it's better for the US if she STAYS over here.Odious. Simply odious."
3,Have phone for a year.,I had this phone for almost a while and I thought it was real cool.But then again it this was my first cell and I did not know any better. This phone is just a phone with no features at all. It is rock solid and can get dropped hundreds of times. I would stay away from it because NET10 now offers the W375 which looks like the RAZR.
3,Ok Phone,"Ive had this phone for a couple of years and it's great, I get service almost everywhere.. The only things I dont like about it is that when Iget a call I have to open it to see who it is, I wish it had a displayscreen on the outside, thats one thing I dont like. Also I dont likethat I cant get any ringtones I like... you can only pick out of whatis already there(and to me they all arent good.). Texting is also great its fast and easy, but still the cost gets you... To buy the Minutes for it is a hassel, they are hard to find, not very many storescarry Net10 products, for how many minutes you get for the price its ok.Like, usually I'll buy 300 minutes - $30.00, which isnt bad, but its still not alot of minutes for that much money. And they go very fast especially if you talk alot like me. But as for service, it is great! Honestly I wouldnt recommend this phone, unless you like very simple things.I hope this helps!! :)"
1,Horrible Price!,"I have been a NET 10 user for a few years and have been pleased with the service so far. I only use my phone every once in a while so it's great for me. However, if you are looking into buying this phone, go to the NET 10 site to buy it! They have this exact model for $19.99 with all the same stuff put on it. That's a $70 savings. But like I said, NET 10 is perfect for people who only use their phone occassionally."
5,Groove-a-licious!,"I never knew of this band until just this year. I was played a demo of their music and was totally blown away by what I heard. They offer a sound that has been missing in the music industry for years. The groove, the horns and the very soulful vocals all are pleasing to the ear.Their music is comparable to; Blood Sweat & Tears, Bob Seger and Chicago. It's the type of CD that you put in your player and let it go. You can't say that about too many groups nowadays.Buy it. Enjoy it and share it with your friends and family. It's candy to the ears!"
5,Great Mic - Bad Software,"This mic has excellent sound quality for recording and is easily recognized by Windows. The Cakewalk software that comes with it, however, is unbelievably complicated. I also have Acid Pro by Sony and it is easy to operate and gets excellent results. I use the mic every day, but I removed the Cakewalk software."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this product elsewhere for $29.95, and it's not worth it. The only nice thing is that it holds the Zune (although not very firmly). While I could hear what I was playing, there was always static with it. Worst of all, it fell apart! The plug on the player end fell apart with the second use, and the plug to the lighter completely fell off after only a couple months!"
1,Annoying Buzz - doesn't work at all for Zune,"I was so excited when I bought this item because there aren't many accessories for the Zune. I was so disappointed when I plugged it into the car and Zune and got nothing but an annoying high pitched buzz or hum no matter which channel we tried.Satechi cheerfully offered to refund my money but I never got around to sending it back. Oh well -- I can use it as an expensive Zune charger for the car, I suppose."
2,product defect,dvd appeared to be in good shape wien it arrived. we played it a few days ago and everything was fine for approx 70% of the movie. it then atarted stopping and blurring and getting out of focus. i played another movie later and had no problem. would like to get a different one if possible.
1,Wrong item.,"I received the wrong DVD in the right case. When I notified the seller, they did give a full refund but said they could not find the correct movie."
1,Input,I have see better work from 5 year olds. I would never sign you for a record deal. You make me sick and you bring much shame to all artists when you put up petty work like this.
3,BAD in a FUN way...,"A lot of people hate on this movie...and I don't blame them.Yes it's a [literal] bad movie, but honestly, you have to have a certain type of sense of humor to really enjoy it.As cheesy as it is, I laughed my ASS off... I then showed it to my friends and they laughed their asses of, too.A part of you may die inside watching it, but at least you'll be amused/entertained.So, if you are looking for a serious horror movie...don't buy this one.If you are looking for something to laugh at, or even better, laugh with your friends at, then definitely buy it.It grows on you...like a tumor of joy!"
5,BAD REVIEWS WHO CARES SEE THIS!,"I want critics to know that when i see a movie in the horror genre with a ton of bad reviews chances are im gonna love it, i grew up liking everything that got a bad review, like alice cooper, kiss and horror films, i cant wait to see this movie!"
2,"Good, but NOT excellent","If you are into AMATEUR mediocre video's, buy this one, if not, DON'T and buy the BEST MOTORING DVD and VHS videos"
4,Mischief,"This DVD is one of the coolest 'documentaries' that I have ever seen. It seems like you're right with the authors, whether it be avoiding the police or whipping around through traffic in exotic cars. This fast paced DVD will keep you glued to your seat wondering ""what will they do next?"" The music combined with the footage is right on. From the beginning to the end this DVD stands out from most other documentaries. If you're into the 'underground' race scene I highly suggest this DVD."
5,Very Good Book,Simple and straight to the point. I found it inspiring in many ways. Main lesson: you have all you need -- right now -- to be happy. Now.
5,Good insightful book,"This book is great. It really makes you think about life, priorities in life and how the choices we make affects others in our life."
5,Wise & Enlightening,"It is rare that I would read a book more than once (except when studying for exams decades ago), this is one of them & I'm keen to do so. By beautifully integrating wisdom from scientific, philosophical, & religious perspectives, Ricard has not simply offered me enlightening insight about what happiness is about, he also illustrated how one could lead a fulfilling & compassionate life. I look forward to learn more from Ricard, practice his advice, & lead my mind to where serenity resides."
1,I agree with the reviewer I Should Be So Lucky,"I agree with the reviewer I Should Be So Lucky.I am happy that author came from and was a member of the Parisian intelligencia and was able to hold discourse with the cream of society. He then was able to afford to go to Nepal to study Tibetan Buddism and supported himself. This took him quite a number of pages to say. By the time he was ready to discuss the book's subject, I was quite depressed and could read no further. This negated the promise and premise of the book for me."
2,Herself?,"Every example which refers to the reader assumes that you are female.""One who is at peace with herself will contribute spontaneously to establishing peace within her family, her neighborhood, and, circumstances permitting, society at large.""I'm not sure why this is, as the convention is to use the masculine. Whatever the reason, as a man it is quite off putting when you are trying to comprehend a foreign concept and are constantly being labeled the wrong gender."
4,does what I paid for,Considering the cost of oem remotes this inexpensive alternative does exactly what I need it to do and fits within a budget. I installed and was able to use this device in literally less than 1 minute. If you read the product information or reviews before you buy an item you'd learn that this device needs a 110volt outlet at the fireplace. Only the remote is battery operated. Don't underrate an item because you don't read the description properly.
4,Blackberry Pearl clear cover works well,"I started with the black version of this, and it saved my phone in the first week. Now that the black one has road rash, I've replaced it with this clear one. I like that the keyboard lighting shows through the clear cover, so it's more usable in low light conditions. This one also was manufactured without a hole to let the sounds out the top, but was easily modified with some sharp scissors. The price was unbeatable."
2,"The fourth in her velvet series: a dull, predictable read.","I think Ms. Deveraux could have done way better than this. I knew what was going to happen before I finished reading the last ten chapters. Elizabeth gave in to easily to Miles's charms. She was a strong intelligent character, her motto should have been,"" fight to the death."" and if she was really smart she would have made use of that ax when she had the chance( not doing brutal harm mind you). Sometimes Miles deserved it.:)"
4,Another velvet? Terrific!,Elizabeth and Miles. Enemies. What happens when you mix the two of them together? Plenty! You just have to read to find out
2,Only Collectors should buy this,These CDs are truly for Collectors Only. There are way too many unfamiliar songs for the casual listener.
2,not as good as expected,Not as good as expected. Had to go to Motorola help line to get it to work. It would just freeze up when using. Had to make some modifications to sowftware that wasn't explained in the original purchase
2,Software stinks,"1) The install software is very flaky - bogus messages and windows that fail to close ... and very slow on windows 2000 where the install limped to an indefinite finish.2) Windows XP warned, after the install was underway, that this software could well be bogus, not XP approved, and could cause big trouble. I decided to abort, but couldn't cancel and had to CTRL-ALT-DEL to kill the install. I wonder if this is legit Motorola software - the CD label seems kind of crude - matching the contents.3) All in all: disappointing. ""you get what you pay for"" and the price matched the performance in this case. But I wonder if this is all that's available.4) I just wanted to be able to use my PC USB port to charge the 'phone ... and hoped that all I'd have to do is plug it in without ""phone tools"" ... nope!"
1,DISAPPOINTED,My laptop Windows XP did not recognize the Motorola disk. Neither did any of my Macs = G3 (OS 9.2) or G4 or DuoCores (OS 10.4). Too bad.I'm not about to pay Motorola a fee for emailing each photo.
1,Help!!!,I put in the cd and nothing came up. I'm very unhappy.. i got the L6 as a christmas present and i only really wanted the phone so i could take pictures.. and i can't do that without a cd and its really aggravating. can anyone help me? DON'T BUY THISSSSS!!! jdskfhkljasd it sucks.
1,"Great translation, horrible edition","As a French reader of the original book, I appreciated the efforts of the translator to keep the rhymes of the original. This is spoilt by one of the poorest edition I have ever seen. The fonts are too fancy to read, the layout is not nice, I spotted 3 errors in the typography at the first read... I have the feeling that the editor spent 10 minutes overall to make this book. Avoid this buy."
5,If You Are a Fan,"You can't live without this DVD!! Hilarious!! If you need your humour wet, enough to soak you with a super soaker...or shall I say, if that kind of thing amuses, you won't like this....but if your sense of humour is dry as the desert and you can understand heavy BRIT...you'll love THIS!!! Run and buy it!!"
5,CD review,"YO this cd is incredible and its a must have for n e hip hop fan, like heltah skeltah and the rest of the boot camp click, O.G.C. has come up with some amazin' beats and lyrics like their other cd da storm its bangin'."
5,A Doll Head with a poseable body,I got this for my daughter's 7th Birthday and She Loves It!!! When she unwrapped it at her party all the other little girls attending eyes' lit up too. Their parents all want to know where I got it from. I had the opportunity to play with her first and I am iimpressed. The only complaint is the hair extensions (hi-lites) are horrible and we had to throw it away. But the accessories are cool and my daughter can wear them too which is a plus. The price is great and I am becoming a fast fan of the My Scene dolls.
2,Not happy,The bit works well if in soft wood. When cutting through stud wall I find the bit getting stuck in the wall from the tear out on the back side of the stud. Once the spur in through the wood you need to apply a lot of pressure on the drill for the bit to cut through the stud. When cutting deep holes the cuttings making the bit hard to get it out of the drilled hole.
3,Genuine characters,"This was definitely a good read, despite some faults.Olivia Dearing attends a masquerade in a mood of rebellion and a desire to kick over the traces after her painful marriage. There she meets Sir Jeremy Fairhill and their instant attraction and a single kiss leads to her being shunned by Society.They meet again some time later through their association with the Foundling Hospital. Olivia has been taking foundlings into her home to raise and Jeremy is on the board of governers. He is investigating her fitness, and is trying to discover the truth about her after hearing the gaggle of scandalous talk surrounding her.Their attraction renews, scandal is ever present ...A well told tale, well drawn characters in Olivia and Jeremy. We gradually learn the painful stories of their respective marriages and how that drives their current behaviour.I did feel that the scandal angle which Olivia pushes to refuse him is over the top and Olivia is a bit of a coward.A slight marring."
4,Cow Kitchen,"so ""Mitt"" means one (I actully questioned it). I wasn't upset it was a present for my mom whos doing a cow themed kitchen, she loved it all the same :D"
1,For decorative use only...,"This oven mitt is very cute. Other than that, there is no reason to purchase it. There is a tag inside (not easy to see, since it is over an inch into the mitt) that has care instructions and at the bottom of the tag, it says ""FOR DECORATIVE USE ONLY"" I did not see this prior to attempting to use it, and it definitely does not protect against the heat. I would only recommend purchasing this item for decoration or as a puppet. The fact that the product description calls it ""...practical and a well-built kitchen tool"" is misleading."
3,Ok,This could be higher quality and cuter. Sorry but I'm not very impressed. I'm writing more words because this feature demands it.
4,Good quality light,Got this one for my bathroom. good quality as described.The price was much lower than Home Depot's.Will buy more.
2,Not worth the money.,"I have to agree with the first poster. This is not a good book.It might have some useful information for complete beginners, but the quality of the code is quite simply bad and extremely amateurish.Peter"
4,One small concern away from awesome,"First and above all is the base's stability. Of the combo stands I've seen lately, this is the first that can be set up in any direction without fear of tipping. My only concern is how DW attaches the dogbone for the cymbal boom directly to the ball-jointtom arm. However it does have a way to add an additional cymbal boom. Otherwise five stars."
1,A required strange read for my course,This book jumps all over the place and hardly anyone in my class enjoyed it. The instructor quickly removed it from her syllabus for the next time she taught this course.
4,Vintage Al,Highly enjoyable production from Al's commercially successful years. The only drawback is that the DVD ends much too soon.
1,Very Disappointed,"This was very disappointing. The ""sprayer"" is just for looks, you basically have to color on the tattoos with the markers. It would be less money to go buy some markers aand tattoos etc.. This was definately not worth 25 dollars."
2,What a mess!,Unlike the other reviews the airbrush worked great. It was easy to use and the tattoos were clear and dark. The problems came later. When the already dry tattoos get wet they smear and make a huge mess! The instructions warn that the ink will stain just about anything. After my daughter washed her hands a little water got on one tatoo which ran all over her arm. I had to drag her back to the sink to wash it off before her clothes were ruined.
2,Product Doesn't Last,"My daughter rec'd this for her birthday. It lasted only a few days. We believe the airbrush mechanism pulled loose so it has no power, which means no airbrushing!"
2,Its okay,"Not exactly what we expected, you put a tiny marker into the air gun and it blows the marker fluid onto your skin. The markers are the smallest markers that I have ever seen. You can do 3 maybe 4 tatoos with one color and then it runs out. The stencil is a sticker so once you use it, it loses its stickyness and doesn't work very well the next time, double stick tape worked better. Knowing what I know now, I would maybe spend 10 dollars on a product like this."
1,NOT THAT MUCH FUN,THIS TOY IS O.K IT'S NOT AS FUN AS YOU THINK. THE INK GOES EVERY WHERE WHEN YOU SPRAY IT. IT'S TAKES A WHILE FOR THE INK TO COMPLETELY WASH OFF. THE AIR DOESN'T REALLY SPRAY CLEARLY LIKE IT'S SUPPOSE TO. YOU HAVE TO SPRAY IT CLOSELY SO IY CAN ACTUALLY WORK. I THINK FOR 25 DOLLARS IT'S NOT WORTH IT.
5,the reason I like poetry,"I'm 32 and got into poetry late in life, probably because I didn't know what the heck a poem was or how, assuming the poem was even intelligible, it could change your life. But all that changed when I discovered Sure Signs.What I like about Mr. Kooser's poems is that I can actually understand them. I was suprised to read a poet this readable, a poet who helped me to see the small, beautiful things in life, and, perhaps most of all, drove me to the library where I checked out more volumes of poetry.What amazed me is how Mr. Kooser can put the profound into very simple words. I can say that after reading these poems, and others like them, I am a better human being than I was before I started reading poetry. This wouldn't be the case if I hadn't found a poet I could finally understand. I'll never read ""academic"" poetry again."
2,a better choice for shirelles' fans,"As a collector myself, I was very pleased and somewhat dismayed to read the 2 reviews of the Collectables 3 disk Shirelles set. However, Amazon does have a very all-inclusive set,(The Shirelles:The Definitive Collection), containing songs mysteriously deleted from the Collectables set (31 flavors, Mad mad world), as well as the highly sought after Blue Holiday. This set is 2 disks from Charly(UK import), selling for under $15 (1/2 the price of the Collecables discontinued set). It contains 65 tunes, has been gloriously remastered, and contains an informative discography. For me, it's a no-brainer. The Charly set is the way to go!-delivered promptly. 5 stars from a devoted oldies fan"
3,Quality Of Episodes Vary In The Series,"Jason King is the greatest reason to watch Jason King, with plots and dialogue secondary considerations. This is unfortunately a must, as Peter Wyngarde knows his character better than the writers know the rest of the series. I can enthusiastically recommend 20 of the 26 shows. DVD picture quality is poor (6 on a scale where 10 is perfect)."
1,This line of products is potentially dangerous.,"There have been many complaints and injuries caused by products made by this company, also knowns as ""ultrex"" by Innova, including second and third degree burns. They are now out of business, so if something goes wrong, you are probably out of luck. There have been a few official recalls, but they only called back one pressure cooker with a different model number. The lids blew, just like the other reviewer stated, only his particular model wasn't recalled. HSN sold thousands of them. Some pans were also recalled, because the coating separated and flew off in people's faces, burning them with hot grease. I WOULD NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS LINE, USED OR NEW!! MADE IN CHINA AND TOO DANGEROUS!!!"
3,flexible shoe,"The saw is very useful for remodeling, including for use in cutting openings for windows through studs. Also it is greatfor cutting 4x4's in one pass. The shoe however is very flexible, made of sheet metal, and in fact came pre-bent. I guess that was so I did not have to worry about bending it myself. The result is a rounded and rather unstable base.I suggest that Milwaukee redesign the shoe and get it up to the same level of quality as the rest of the saw."
2,Taiwan Junk!,"No offense to Taiwainese folks, I'm just big on domestic tools. Hey Amazon! Your Technical Data link says USA for Coutry of Manufacture. (I've noted in several instances of tools I know to be imported that the listing says they were made here.) The box, maybe but the saw was made in Taiwan. Maybe that was just the couple of these I've seen and used and the rest are made here (doubt it). Gave it two stars because even though it's junk, it's a Milwaukee and it's powerful. Not accurate like everyone else has said. Buy a Big Foot!"
3,Thirteenth Floor Elevators-'1966-1967 Unreleased Masters Collection' (Collectables) 3-CD Box Set,"Even though I'm a fan of this Texas psychedelic band of many days gone, I am GLAD that I actually got to borrow a copy of this 3-CD box set release. Total of 44 tracks. Discs one and two are re-edits and live versions of songs off their first two records. Sure, it's always good to hear ""Roller Coaster"", ""Monkey Island"", ""Reverberation"", my personal 13th Floor favorite ""She Lives (In A Time Of Her Own)"" and others, but THIS is really over doing it. Disc three is mostly unfamiliar tunes that I've never heard before, however some of the tunes here are actually decent. I know this is a 3-CD box set, but I STILL thought it was over-priced. Not only is this title for completists, but for someone who has ca$h to burn as well."
4,Powerful Stuff!,"Give Wounded Bird Records credit for finally putting back in print one of the great party albums of the seventies. This 1973 release featured their biggest hit, the million-selling ""Smokin' in the Boy's Room."" Co-written by bassist Michael Lutz and guitarist Cub Koda, this song showed the rest of the country what the Midwest already knew-Brownsville Station was one of the rockinest bands on the circuit.Though the album contains only one other original (another Lutz-Koda song, ""All Night Long""), they included well chosen covers, like The Balloon Farm's 1968 hit ""A Question of Temperature,"" Ray Parker's 1966 hit ""Barefootin'"" and Hoyt Axton's ""Lightnin' Bar Blues."" They even covered fellow Ann Arbor native Terry Knight's ""Love, Love, Love.""Sadly, Koda died of kidney disease in 2000 at the age of 51. As a music journalist (he was a staff writer for ""Goldmine"" magazine), Koda was a champion of all kinds of music. This album is a testament to his talents. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
1,Insurmountable quality issues,"This release was discontinued by the label (GDM), and it's now apparently obvious why. Many if not all of the tracks of this release sound as though they come from lossy-encoded sources. The compression artifacts -- the whole gamit: pre-echo, ringing, warbling -- are obvious even to the most casual listener.This lack of quality is surprising given the exceptional quality of the other two GDM soundtracks for the trilogy. Google tells me that the explanation is likely that the masters were either lost or destroyed. But why couldn't they have reconstructed from better secondary sources? This one sounds abysmal.I cannot possibly recommend this release, even to so-called completists. If you want to hear decent versions of selections of this soundtrack, I strongly recommend ""La trilogia del dollaro"" over this one. It exhibits some hiss from circa 1960s analog recordings, but that's a small price to pay for its vastly superior fidelity."
1,Opportunity Lost,"An empty meaningless exercise in futility. If there was ever a chance for forgiveness, redemption and finding a way to evolve compassion and synergy between two people in need, this plot is the perfect set up. There was every opportunity for the lead characters to find a way to harmonize their efforts and both come out ahead in the process.Unfortunately, in a supposedly Christian nation, this film, like so many others, devolves into chaos and acrimony and leaves us feeling empty and dissolute. A movie for the lost who enjoy their misery..."
2,long so long + laboring onirism,"went through the first two volumes, and collapsed during this one. reminds me of Jordan and his wheel, why does it take 100 pages and 5 chapters for one scene to unfold, and 600 pages for a 10 page story to be told?the dreaming snakes are so boring, just like the wheel, turns on and on, or like the rock: rolls and rolls, but not much mossThe assassin series was much more efficient... I don't mind descriptions and feelings but repetition and lack of imagination shows too much in this one, Hobb really labored hard to conclude this series..."
4,"The Mad Ship [The Liveship Traiders, book 1 & 2]",First time I have come across this author and I find it very different but interesting. It is very different from the novelsI normally read. The 3 book series is quite good. Can't wait to read book 3.
5,"Fabulous Fantasy, NO SPOILERS!","This book (and the Liveship Traders trilogy in summary) is one of the very best high fantasy creations I have ever read. Having been a sci-fi and fantasy reader for somewhere around 40 years now, I have read quite a lot of it, too! Hobb's writing style is unmistakably fantasy material, without being too wordy or flowery, yet still, never descending to the likes of most modern-day general fiction. Outstanding characterization, fantastic world-building without *too* much detail, avoiding the frequent downfall of some fantasy which spends too much time on what every surrounding looks like and/or means. Fat fantasy at its finest, nothing wasted, including your time! If you're a fantasy fan, this one is not to be missed!"
2,"Ok, but overhyped","I must be missing something. I was not too much of a Meghan Lindholm fan before she became Robin Hobb, but I must admit I really enjoyed the Farseer books. There is a forced quality to the writing here that does not appeal to me, however. The characterizations lack depth and humanity--I'm sorry--I don't see it. Perhaps it is so wrapped up in the extremes of the fantasy.I am also annoyed that this book did not tie in to the first volume the way it should have."
5,The Madship continues a great saga,"This series is one of the greatest I have ever had the pleasure to delve into. I did not think that Robin could have surpassed her previous works but she keeps doing it. This book is non stop reading, and don't buy this book unless you have a strong marriage. My wife got a little irritated because I was in another world while reading it. My highest recommendation."
3,dissapointed,"The books leading up to this one were well-written, if long-winded, but in this volume the story fizzles out to the point where I don't even want to finish the book, much less the next and final one in this trilogy. The first trilogy, The Farseer (Assassin) series was fascinating."
2,The author is sad.,"The ""Old"" people in the book seem to avoid Rothman's cloying attempts to make himself feel better by being around those he considerers weak and irrelevant.But the statement of this book is powerful, albeit wholeheartedly unintentional.Mainly that the youth of this country are pathetic, lazy, and selfish and yet want so much back form the world.The author needs to visit Africa for a time being and see if he could muster trying to survive over there.He wouldn't last a week.He has the sense of humor of 16 year old. Oh, I forgot he writes for network (or did) TV. A perfect fit!"
5,Excellent,The music in this film is purely delightful. The story is sweet. The acting is excellent. Good light entertainment for the holidays.
4,Good movie worth seeing,If you can't stand movies with a narrator don't bother. but it's a great movie if you do. just enough humor and not a deep story line. just a fun movie.
5,Finally! A clue for the hand quilting clueless.,"If you've experienced the same problems I have you will discover that this is one of those rare books that is worth more than what you paid. My previous attempts at hand quilting looked like they had been done by a toddler and left my already aching wrists feeling like someone had taken a hammer to them. I bought the book with mixed feelings: delight that the issue of comfort was so thoroughly addressed and doubt that it would improve the quality of my work. I followed her guidelines for selecting materials and came back from the store just hoping that my stitches would turn out straight and even this time. Within 10 minutes I was astounded to discover that my stitches were not only straight and even, my stitches were small! The most wonderful thing is that my stitches keep getting smaller and my wrists are still pain free."
5,Wonderful Book for the Beginner and Expert Alike,"I bought this book expecting to learn how to make a better stitch, but I got so much more out of it! Not only does Ms. Mcelroy explain her technique, she tells you the best materials to use and why they are superior.I also consider my Roxanne Thimble to be one of my prized possesions. It is almost like a piece of jewelry to me.I am saddened that Ms. Mcelroy has passed away, knowing that she would have contributed so much more to quilters throughout the quilting community."
5,Was A Guy Gift,"His comments were very favorable. Only used once...so far, so good. Polisher was a good weight, and really did a great job(my car). Nothing like giving a guy a new toy that benefits you as well!Shipping was prompt."
1,Have not receive book,Dear Sir/MadamThank you for informing me about my product but i have not recieve my product as jet I am now fustrated could you please informe where is my stuff today TRACKING NO;GM1088134016299370FRANCES kIRTON
4,MS PRESTIGE LT CASE,"It is very well made case. Purchased it for Sony Vaio 15.4"" LT but it didnt fit, but most 15.4"" should since Vaio's are wider. It has great padding and plenty of pockets for magazines, books, papers and all the needed accesories such as power adapter, mouse & cables and whole lot more. Its very stylish looking and compact yet expandable!"
3,DTV Customer Service,"I spoke with DTV and I guess it depends on if you own the receiver or not. I got the name of the rep and several emails that says I do not have to enter into a new agreement if I buy from a 3rd party, only from DTV. Now, the difference is I own my other 2 receivers so this might be different if you are leasing the others."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT !!!!,"Same thing happened to me. I was replacing an old d10 with the h20-600. I had to fight with Directv customer service for over an hour to get them to deactivate this box; allow me to return it; and remove the two-year commitment from my account. I have been with directv for 8 years..... Come this weekend, I am switching to dish. They are sneaky and dishonest. Never again."
5,INCREDIBLE CD,"This CD was pretty much my introduction into the world of Solid Steel/Ninja Tune, and it is just good. I don't really know what to say. It keeps a moderately fast pace until the end where it slows down a bit. I have been getting all the songs that this CD is made up of, and it is kind of bizarre for me to hear how little acctual composition was done by DJ FOOD and DK, but the mix is phenomenal. These guys really prove that mixing songs is an art. If you want a great hip hop CD with excellent music and beats, just buy it. This is the sort of album that can completely change your perceptions of what music is and what it should be."
4,For Medium-Duty Work,"I bought one awhile back to drill holes in a slab for anchor bolts. I was drilling 3/4"" inch holes 6"" deep. It did the job, but I think it was at its limit. For anything larger, I would go with a rotary hammer. The only problem I had was keeping the chuck tight enough to keep the bit from slipping. In one way that's safety advantage since the slippage acts like a friction clutch if the bit grabs. I use in now for lighter duty work such as drilling holes for TapCon screws. It's also better for drilling wood than the Hole-Shooter since the rotary speed is higher - 2500 RPM vs. 800 RPM if I remember correctly. I have both, and I use the hammer-drill the most."
4,ALMOST perfect,"Although we have used this model for years, it is gradually being replaced by a similar model which has a keyless chuck. Once you get used to the keyless, it becomes difficult to find fault with the system. This particular model works beautifully, performing all appropriate tasks without a hitch. If you need a half-inch hammer drill, this is clearly my first choice in a keyed-chuck model."
1,Latest McAfee upgrade is a disaster,"At beginning of August I installed the latest upgrade of McAfee VirusScan...it is a complete disaster. Firstly, it also installed Site Advisor uninvited, which is just a nuisance and doesn't provide any information you could not work out with a bit of commonsense. Worse problem is that my email (Outlook) has slowed down and some outgoing emails seem to get in a logjam and fail to send. I've turned off some of the 'features' of the program to try and overcome this but it still causes problems. McAfee's chat room style help service is a joke...you can wait on there for hours and not get an answer, and emails to their help service take several days to get an answer, which is often useless. Phone calls to them have always been a waste of time and usually finish up with them saying the only thing they can think of is to reinstall. Well, duh, I already tried that! I'm switching to another brand."
1,Horrible Customer Service - Problems with Updates...,"I registered the product to get the regular updates. Now I continuously get a message popping up that an update is available. When I try to get the update, I get a message that I am not authorized to receive updates. I log out and log in several times, and once in awhile, I will get the update.I regret replacing Norton with this piece of garbage. Mcafee has gone down hill. I will eventually get annoyed enough to just uninstall the Mcafee and go back to Norton."
2,Fab to flop,"Love, love, loved this scales/timer mounted on the wall next to my cooktop for the first year of its too short life. Enjoyed and used it constantly, so the battery was quickly replaced when read-outs began to sputter off and on, but to no avail--its gone--so much for the excellence of German technology."
5,ksmuga,"Words can't describe how happy I am about this release. This is an excellent concert and one of the best Marc has ever done. If you are a Marc's fan, this is a must have. He will transmit to you the feeling of each song that will touch your soul with his unique style and sensibility. You will be enchanted with his voice!!! He sings the best songs of all his albums although I might say that he excludes some excellent songs like ""No me conoces"" and ""Asi como hoy"", this last one from the album of ""Voces Unidas"" that is just a beautiful song. If you are a Marc fan this is a must have."
5,The Swan Princess (Special Edition),Awesome movie - it's my daughter's favorite movie and it was her number one gift that she wanted for her 14th birthday!
4,A movie you can watch over and over :),"When you have children, you always have to watch movies more then once. Well this movie is one that you won't mind seeing more then once. The music is great and the storyline is always fun. The opening song sequence as they are growing up is one of my favorite parts :) I highly recommend this movie. As with all children's movies there is a bit of cheese, but only a little lol :)"
5,My 5 year old loves this movie!,"The animation and voices are as good as anything disney has put out. The characters and plot are enjoyable, and especially enticing to a child. My girl has the Barbie Swan lake and appears to like this one better. Similar plot as they are based on the same original work, but different enough to make it enjoyable.As an adult I appreciated the fact that it made no overt efforts to push any politically correct agenda - as so many animated movies do these days. It is politically correct in its own representation, but has no moral message being pushed on my child."
1,Hung Lake.,"At least the Japanese version gives Odette a love Rival; Odeal the Black Swan, & it's almost tragic ending made the happy moment more blissfull, with the music Tchaikovsy intended it to have.I absolutely would not reccomend this video to anyone who like the original story or music (plus lip-sync toons are bad for foreign sales)Plus it's irritatingly too modern for the time its set in."
3,A little violent.,"My 2 yr old and 5 yr old love this movie. My 2 yr old calls herself ""odette,"" after the swan princess. But there is a lot of fighting for young ones. They love the songs, too."
2,teletype,no inside info only a bunch of newspaper articles put togetherno real flavor the book is reported
5,A job well done!,"This book is a more comprehensive look at a number of informants for the FBI nationwide, including Jack Presser and others.One thing this book nor other the other,Black Mass, brings up, is that a man named Rossi attached to the DA's office was scandalized for making manipulating phone calls and for having personal documentation suggesting Bulger and Flemmi be investigated.Would Billy Breen have any information relevant to these guys?Why has the media not investigated former army buddies of Flemmi at home and in Korea nor air force colleagues of Bulger?"
1,Returned it!,This nicely designed crate has a fatal flaw. It exudes a strong chemical odor that pervaded my house. I could not stand it. A canine's sense of smell is exponentially stronger than a humans. I would not ask a dog to spend time in this. Note this is made in China. Their track record for items made for human use has not been good. It is cause for concern. Thank goodness for Amazon's return policy. Buyer beware here.
4,Good but a bit tippy,"Great for travel, but tippy in house with rambunctious puppy, who likes it a lot."
2,Destroyed,"This shelter was easy to set up and great product. My dog destroyed it in one sitting (ripped holes in it, broke the ""sturdy"" corners), would not recommend."
4,"Very Nice, but Bulky","The bag had very high ratings, so I purchased it. No doubt, it is a solid, well put together bag. I do not expect anything less from Wenger. I was a bit disappointed by the overly buly top part of the bag, but the other facets of the bag are so great I decided to keep the bag."
5,A Rose Beneath the Thorns,"A HARD TO PUT DOWN BOOK. From wanting to see what could happen next, to what else could happen to this poor woman. This woman that went thru so much & never gave up looking for happiness. I'm glad to see another cycle of abuse was broken. Her children are successful & the struggle to make it is not as tough for them, thanks to her endurance. It must have taken a lot to relive all of this & share her life with us, Thank you for that. I know that we are never alone it is good to see I am not alone in this belief. I look forward to more from Rose, you left me wondering."
1,mess up to be sure,someone has put a singer named charlie parker onto a movie called escape of the birdmen or just the birdmen. doesn't anyone at amazon read what is on their site???
4,Marvelous Cd,"This cd is very hard to find, so if you can find one, I would grab it!! The tracks on this cd are not breathtaking, but they are decent. The soulpower Radio Remix is nothing more than the version that appeared in the video. I do like that version, so it is nice to have it on a cd. Again, if you can find this cd, grab it. They are very rare!"
4,Stan and Ollie's Hilarious Feature Debut,"""Pardon Us"" gets a bad rap from several critics and historians who consider the film incredibly padded. In actuality, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's first feature-length comedy holds up among their better efforts while retaining the hilarious spirit of the Hal Roach two-reelers. A 1931 prison spoof, ""Pardon Us"" benefits from its increased budget (the penitentiary sets are impressive), a fine supporting cast and some charming musical numbers - particularly Ollie's rendition of ""Lazy Moon."" The scene where Stan and Ollie maintain a cell-bound conversation in complete darkness has a bleak quality reminiscent of Samuel Beckett. As the thuggish ""Tiger,"" Walter Hall remains the quintessential L&H heavy. Though it's great to have the pre-release version, this DVD should have included the final theatrical cut for comparison."
5,Steve Reeves is awesome,Steve Reeves is flipping awesome. The movies are terrible and Steve has all the range of Arnold Schwarzenegger but that's not why you should buy this anyhow. Steve-F'in-Reeves is why you should buy this. Meet the man who made muscles cool.
5,Great flash for the price!,"This is a great flash for the price. I wanted the 580EX but it was a bit too pricey for my first flash and I figured in the future I would need a slave so I purchased this flash.This flash is super easy to use, just insert the batteries, attach and set your camera to program mode and start shooting. An adjustable flash head is important if you want to experiment and this fits the bill.To take this flash to the next level be sure to get Gary Fong's collapsible Lightsphere attachment, you will absolutely love it!Happy shooting!"
2,Not happy with 430EX,I have been using this 430EX for few years with my RebelXTI. I have a terrible time getting good pictures. The pictures are usually dark in 95% of the cases even in auto ETTL modeCanon Speedlite 430EX II Flash for Canon Digital SLR Camerasand I end up removing it and using the built-in flash. I am sure I need some help to use it correctly. Can some body help?
5,430EX II,I thought a lot between 430EX II & 530EX II. I mostly buy the latest and best product available. So my prefer choice was 530EX II. But I was not ready to spend $370 for a flash especially when I am not a professional and don't earn money taking pictures. Also I do not need any wireless flash firing at this point.Though I am serious about photography and would like to become professional some day but not right now and considering my current need I decided to buy 430 to save some $$ and weight over my camera (there is significant wt different bt 430 and 530). I am very satisfied with my decision.
5,speedlite for everyone,Excellent product and value. This is an easy to use speed flash and is suitable for beginners as well as your more experiance photographers. Its multifunction operations give you many options for most situations.
5,Buy this good flash first before thinking of investing in any lense,"This can be had for as low as 350 USD.After buying, play around with the curtain sync settings, bounce, and diffusers. You'll immediately see payoff in your investment, through quality pictures.This is really indispensible at indoor shooting.I also see improvements in battery and recharge time compared with make I of this 580 model.You cant go wrong with this investment."
3,Works well,Good basic lighting unit. But Instruction Manual is sketchy and don't show you it's many uses. Wish gave examples of how to use instead of letting you guess how.
5,great deal on a flash,"My wife uses this flash with her Canon Rebel XT, and its great. It has a lot of nice features found in much more expensive flash units and is very well made and sturdy. This flash has a fast recovery time and can snap many pictures in succession very quickly. I highly recommend this flash to anyone shopping for a decent flash in this price range."
5,Buy this one -- not the other Canon flashes,"I realize this is expensive, but it gives you A LOT more options and power. It's also measurably more bulky than my 420EX flash, but it's worth rearranging my photo bag to accomodate it.There's a few complaints about the menu-based selection of MASTER/SLAVE/Etc instead of the easier to use, pushbutton version, but I'm not finding that much of a problem since I'm really configuring this from the camera's menu anyway.Buy this."
5,580 canon flash,"another great flash by canon, needed a master flash for my other canon speed lite collection and this was obviously the next step. if you need only flash and didn't want to spend the money spend the money this is only a couple of hudnred or so more than 400 series, you will end up getting this if you plan on doing any type of studio, photoshoot or project. company was fast and reliable and no issues on shipping."
4,top of line flash unit from canon,I got this to replace a 10 year old lesser unit. nice features but somehow it burned my batteries when I forgot to shut it off. supposed to hibernate I thought
3,regular flash,"works fine, kind of fast, very good recovery, helps a lot to focus. but the greatest flaw of this one is that only can be use a slave, doesnt have master functions or even worst, doesnt have light sensor."
5,I'm impressed,"I'm new to photography and spending this much on a flash is a big deal to me given that I already have an onboard flash. Big difference in performance though. It really does make you photo look more professional. People often say that the equipment doesn't make good photos but it's the photographer. There is definitely truth to that, but if you need a flash, this flash is better than your onboard. I promise.Also, get a diffuser. Directly on someone or directly bounced still seems harsh to me. I have this one:Stofen OM-EW Omni Bounce For Canon 430EX White"
5,Canon Quality and Ease,Unit is easy to set up and use without pouring thru the manual for hours. Good for pro and beginner.
4,"Canon 580 EX II - Good, solid flash",Good flash with excellent TTL capabilities. The metal shoe is a nice feature. Very easy to use right out of the box.
3,Suddenly stops working!,"I was really looking forward to getting this flash and planned to use it to shoot an upcoming wedding. Well...thankfully I had a backup flash with me, because after shooting for a while, the flash just stops working consistently. It will fire 5 times and not fire for 4 shots. I am afraid now to trust it to shoot another wedding. I don't know if I just got a defective unit or not. I am hoping Canon will either fix or replace it. I will update this after if possible."
2,The best place to buy this Speedfllash at all.,"I brought this item back on March 7, 2010.. I just found out that the Modeling Lamp and the ETTL function wasn't working at all.. I had to take it to Canon repair warrantly and pay a extra $15.00 for shipping. I wished i brought it from Adorama instead of amazon.. At least Adorama is very well trusted."
5,I'm just as amazed as everyone else,"When I was looking for a flash for my EOS5D I looked at this one and the Speedlight 430. I'm so glad I got this one. Don't get me wrong, the 430 is a great flash too! This one just knocked my socks off. I've been able to get flash photo's of my cats without the demon kitty eye's you get. And with the variety of settings it can do just about anything you need. Just make sure to keep that owner's manual handy. There are more settings than you probably know what to do with.I definitely recommend this flash for the serious and not so serious photographer!"
5,These are great.,"Powerful, durable, versatile, and really expensive. That's this toy.I bought 2, with an ST-E2, as a bundle for a little under $900, and I love the kit. Recycle is fast, they're very quiet (I still have an old 540EZ that you can tune a piano with from 300 yards away), and battery efficiency seems pretty good, although I've yet to have a really, really long session.No need to carry on - the other reviewers here did just fine. Need a big, fat, portable light and E-TTL? Go buy one. Or two!Highly recommended.UPDATE 6-14-2008 - I finally shot a wedding with these. I have 2, and the ST-E2. I use Sanyo Eneloop batteries to power them, and in all took roughly 400 photos during the event with flash on, one of them set 1/1 for most of the shots. Battery longevity is WAY better than my old 540EZ, totally surprising. I never changed the batts the whole time. Better and better the longer I use them."
5,wow! Excellent,"Been using mine for 3 months with Canon 40D, a perfect combo. They work great together in Program mode, and it's easy to switch to Manual mode for independent control. The swivel head is SOOOOO convenient to get nice bounce flash from any direction. Of course, that's just the beginning. This is a very versatile flash. A bit expensive, but very sophisticated with the potential to keep up with all your needs."
4,I've always wondered...,"why this album was so villified by the folks who think Ambrosia's debut is the masterpiece it is. While not in the same class - and barely in the same genre - ""Life Beyond L.A."" has much to recommend it. In fact ""the HIT"" (How Much I Feel) isn't all THAT cheesy by the era's standards and is at least listenable. There are five great songs (1,2,3,8,10) and three damned good ones(4,7,9) to ""make up"" for ""How Much I Feel.""""Angola"" is great fun, and the lyrics are a reality check for those of us going through hard times. (Again!) Remember, the economy was a basket case in the late '70's and early '80's also.Anyway, great production, great musicians and good songwriting make for a pretty good album. Listen with fresh ears. Is it as good as Ambrosia 1? Nope, but it is a good album in its own right, and an enjoyable listen."
2,Part description needs to be changed!,"I ordered this part for my Mercedes C32 AMG because the description said it would fit. When I got the part and compared it to the original, it wasn't even close. This part will probably fit a normal C-class vvehicle, but it does not fit the AMG model. The return process was very easy though, so I'm happy with that."
3,wouldn't know,"I ordered this holster and the money went through, about 2 weeks later I got a notification that my money was being transfered back into my account. I WANTED it, but I guess I need to find a new one"
1,Please Don't Waste Your Money,"I usually do not take the time or trouble to write reviews; however, I am making an exception because i feel a sense of duty to warn anyone who may be considering buying this DVD to PLEASE, please do not waste your money. This is one of the worst movies ever made. The plot is indecipherable; the acting is deplorable; and, the special effects and CGI are cheap, hokey, and laughable. I actually was riveted throughout the entire 90 min. because I couldn't believe how bad it was. And the more I watched, the more I shook my head in disgusted disbelief. There is a protracted scene featuring demonic dolls that is so cheap and creepy, I didn't know whether to laugh or gag. Seriously, the only recommendation I would give this movie is that it is almost worth purchasing just to see how exceedingly execrable it actually is."
1,Murder in Texas,"The particular VHS version of ""Murder in Texas"" I purchased is completely unacceptable. The product was advertised as a 'like new' version of the video. The product stops at frequent intervals and must be restarted to continue viewing. There appears to be lapse between the previous scene and the resumed scene.I have submitted a previous e-mail requesting resolution but have not received a reply."
5,Exceptional value.,This edition makes the english translation available to all those unable to bear the far higher cost of the limited edition. Stackpole continue making these seminal works on German armor available to all. I recomend this title and the series to the amateur WW2 historian.
1,This movie sets is a terrible for children.,"In the garbage truck movie, Dave plays dangerously around a dumpster and falls in only to be lifted up into the trash truck and dumped. He also falls into the back of a small trash truck that drives around with his feet sticking up. While my sons loves to watch the trash truck each week, I do not want him to think it is OK to play or horse around near them.In the fire truck movie, Dave missing the fire truck when it leaves to go on a call and runs into the street to try to catch up by chasing it down the middle of the street. I don't want my son to learn that behavior either.I checked these out of the library and am glad I did not waste my money. There are other live action truck videos for kids that don't encourage dangerous behavior like the ones by Fred Levine including Road Construction ahead and Farm Country Ahead."
3,Cute video but a little dated,I think this video would be great if it had less talking and a little more fire engines. We do like the video. It just needs to be updated.
2,mix?,"Spooky starts out this album strong with tracks that while varied, beg to be amplified. It's a great collection of tracks, but my main difficulty with this album is that's all it is: a collection of tracks. The term ""mixed"" can only be applied loosely to this album at best, as the songs rarely segue from one to the next and many transitions are bluntly abrupt. There isn't really any turntablism on this album either. This being said, I can't figure out what Spooky did other than pick the tracks, and even that falls apart towards the end of the album. Hover dub is 3 minutes of a vacuum sounds. Putting sonic youth in this mix is like trying to put the round peg in the square hole. I expected better out of Spooky."
3,"Service GUIDE, not Manual.","This book is what it says it is - a 'Service Guide'. This, of course, is no shop manual. If you're looking for some basics for preventative maintenance, this is it. If you're a frequent off-roader, get the shop manual or visit [website] for their online forum and step-by-step proceedures (plug, plug!)."
3,Underwhelmed,"I'm an Invicta fan and I purchased this watch with high expectations. In the end though, I had to send it back and look for another model that was more functional. Despite what other reviewers have said, I was unable zero out the sub dials even after reading the (generic) instructions several times. If it can be done, it certainly should be easier to accomplish. Ultimately, the real deal-killer was simply my inability to read the dial. The face is very attractive but the white background and light colored hands and hour markings are a bad combination. Both are ""luminous Tritnite"" which is an off-white color in daylight. There just isn't enough contrast between the white face and the off-white hands to see what time it is at a glance. Other manufactures have pulled off that color combination much more effectively (for instance the Rolex this watch is designed to look like). If you've got eagle eyes and prefer fashion over function, this is your watch!"
5,Top Quality Invicta Watch,i can say it's very nice watch and really made good quality any who want to buy this watch i say go a head and you never lose.I Recommended this Watch for gift it's really Nice Loook .
4,Watch with WOW factor,"I own a Rolex, Omega, and Tag. This is clealy none of the above. But, If you are looking for a knockout watch at a bargain basement price you won't go wrong. It's good looking and feels like an expensive piece."
5,watch review,"received the watch in the usual quick Amazon way and immediately was impressed by the watch. it has a great feel and look, along with the 5 year warranty it was a great buy"
4,Great value,Great value for the $$$. Instruction manual is generic and is sometimes difficult to understand but Invicta answered all my questions via email. I still can't figure out how to set the GMT.
5,bass Therapy,"Another jewel compiled and conceived by Bruno Guez, DUB SELECTOR offers the deepest basstherapy around, as applied by artists such as St-Germain, Luciano, I:Cube, Boozoo Bajou andmore. Paying tribute to the original dub scientists of the 70's, this new generation of groovemasters deliver much needed positive vibrations on 12 superbly chosen tracks."
1,defective drums,"When the time came to replace the drum in my fax machine I went to an office supply store... 3 of them to be exact, including the one I purchased the fax machine from only to find out that these drums now are a special order item and you pay shipping on them. I ordered one had it shipped to my home , installed it and within a month started getting ""white"" columns running vertical down my received fax pages.. not good because now I am missing critical info. Called the help line and was told I had a defective drum. Cannot return or exchange it because It was a special order so now Panosonic is getting anothewr $100 plus shipping from me. This makes 2 drum purchases in less than 6 mo."
1,Fell apart!,"This seems like a well made bag, sturdy material on the outside and looks nice, but after only about 4 uses the thing started falling apart on me. First, the material on the handle side of the case completely ripped out, and then the next day the zipper broke, too. The inside material is really flimsy as well.I don't have a very heavy keyboard and I shudder to think what would happen if I did. This is going back! Very disappointed."
4,"KITTANYA; A CLASSIC FOR TODAYS YOUNG PEOPLE""","It's about time that someone wrote a book that is clean and devoid of smut. Kittanya lets you dream of a world that has survived what man did to it. This book lets people of all ages see a future that doesn't have to be bloody or explosive, it creates a world that is alive with a playfulness that makes this reader pleased to have read it. I have the distinct pleasure to have worked with the author (Ronald L. Rasnake) at a paper mill and I was privy to this story in the making. Bless you Ron for giving me a book that my entire family loves. I cant wait for more."
5,Wolf Hybrid,This is a very informative book. Lots of pictures and well written. Author has great knowledge of her subject.
