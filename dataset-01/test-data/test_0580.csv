3,"sorry, i didn't get it","i ordered this cd last year, but i never received it. so sincerely i got no idea if it's good or not (but i think so, because almost all shepp's records for impulse are at least very good)."
4,"Simple, but great read","This book was very simple, but very interesting. It does not require any economics experience/knowledge. It forces the reader to think about what he/she believes in and why using an economist's perspective."
5,Confirmed BEST point driver,"I did quite a bit of research to identify the best item for framing my artwork, and the Fletcher-Terry point driver came highly rated. I have been frustrated with other drivers and could only hope this one lived up to its reputation. It did, and I am totally pleased with the results. Do follow other reviewers' suggestions to brace your frame against a solid wall or door before using using this point driver. It's quite powerful, and the bracing will ensure your frame does not jerk as the point is driven in, resulting in a sloppy, insecure point that was intended to secure your art."
4,"A very good ""interview book"" for new managers.","This is not a book for people who need short answers and quick fixes. The author explained in detail of the reason to ask each of the questions, what kind of ""red-flag"" to look for, and some of good answers. A must read for new managers."
5,Chain this one to your desk!,"I had to take my copy home, because at work all the other managers kept ""borrowing"" it every time they had to interview a job candidate. It is a quick read, easy to find what you're looking for if you just want to glance at a certain section, but full of incredible information.It tells you all the ""why's"" behind the standard interview questions like ""where do you want to be in 5 years?"", and red flags to look for in candidates. Reading it also helped me know what to say when I was being interviewed!"
5,Overwhelming musical treasure!,"This album is certainly a memorable treasure of the file. It cointains three of the most sublime pages of the Wind literature you may think.Carl Nielsen in these -works- achieves this desirable equilibrium in which expression, vitality and lyricism shake hands. Something similar happens with the String Quartets by Shostakovich. Because most of people only are concerned about the Symphonic Universe and tend to overlook or dismiss this genre.My appreciated reader: By any circumstance you should leave aside this extraordinary album.Five stars from start to finish."
5,War Admiral's Real Name by Janel Gibson,War Admirals real name is Man O War father of Seabiscuit. Man O War was the first one to make horse history with a great speed record. This model is a fun horse to play with buy some race tack and have ready to run a race. But be careful with him and other models they can break easyily. Have fun and try not to break him or Seabiscuit they would't like that.
5,More of the best from Pfanz!,"Like his other outstanding books Pfanz continues the superior details backed by biographies and personal accounts. Pfanz briefly explains the 1st Day battle and how it basically shaped Union and Confederate positions around Cemetary and Culp's Hill. After bringing the reader into position Pfanz brings you to the frontlines as General Ewell and General Howard collide. Ewell and the Confederates seize the town and sharpshooters abound on roof tops while artillery battles take place between Cemetary Hill and Benner's Hill. Pfanz then captures General Johnson's attack and the Confederate repulse as the Confederates struggle to take Culp's and Cemetary Hill and the final attacks fail and continue to cause extreme bloodshed. Maps are also included to assist the reader with positions and movements which completes this fine book. As with all of Pfanz's work, be prepared for a huge amount of detail followed by descriptive action!"
4,Very Well Organized,Good Book. Helps keep various problem-solving techniques clear and distinguishable. Not Sure if this is supposed to complement Erwin Kreyszig famous book of the same name or not.
4,Kewli,"I didn't get to see Warped 2003, (maybe this year!) so I bought the CD. It has tons of awesome songs and the price is unbelievably cheap. I'm new to the ""scene"" so I heard a lot of new bands and some old ones that friends were dying for me to check out. I'm now obsessed with ""Boxcar"" by Stairwell. I thought it would be a live recording, but I'm glad it's not, because then all you can hear is the crowd.GO BUY IT!"
5,The best gambling book of 2002,"This is an easy, fun and exciting read that will be enjoyed by anyone who's ever placed their fate in the hands of the gambling gods.After you read it, you'll soon realize that the real gods of gambling are the seven guys (that you've probably never heard of) featured in the book who learned early on that Lady Luck is a fickle broad who's best left at home."
5,The definitive edition for asipiring poets!,"Very eloquently written! She places it in a nice and easy to read format, with several exercises during the chapter. By the end I was writing Shakesperian sonnets, Ottava Rimas..."
1,Save your money!,"I have written poems in the past and wanted to better myself. I thought this book would be a welcome start. Oh, how wrong I was. I find it useless and uninformative. Nancy Bogen is trying to do a favor by adding 31 addresses of publishers, where a young poet can submit his/her works. Maybe she didn't find it necessary to research the names and addresses further. If she had, she would've found out that 12 of the 31 listed by Ms. Bogen no longer exist. I am very unhappy with this book. Do yourselves a favor and save your money! If you are thinking about submitting your work, please DO NOT submit to ""The Small Pond"" Magazine in Stratford, CT since this editor is very rude and instead of giving constructive criticism about your work, finds it more important to criticize your letter of introduction."
5,The Sleep Ponies,"If you are looking for the perfect book to read to or with a young reader, look no further! The Sleep Ponies is superbly illustrated with charming,bright colored drawings that immediately set the mood for the beautiful story.Each page is a work of art in and of itself. The story is about a young girl who is taught by her grandmother to call The Sleep Ponies.They take her on magical adventures during her naptimes.The writing style is soft and poetical, creating a restful,dreamy mood.For any child who loves horses or any adult who remembers their own youthful daydreams,this is a wonderful experience to share. It is one book that you will not mind hearing over and over again."
2,disappointing,not nearly as good as Classic Hikes. more of an infomercial for a trekking company. not even great photos. Don't bother.
1,Terrible Advice,"This is nothing short of a child abuse manual. My children are very well behaved and neither I nor my husband have ever hit them with our hands or any other object. If you are a true Christian, you should be following the NEW Testament, not the OLD testament. It is only in the old testament that Soloman alludes to a rod. Although even there, the quote is misinterpreted. Rods were used to GUIDE the sheep, not beat them with. In the new Testament Jesus held children in the highest esteem and said that those who offend them should hang a millstone around their neck and drown in the sea. Jesus never advocated hitting, whipping or shaming children. You can set limits and have logical and natural consequences for inappropriate behavior without resorting to violence against children. Violence begets violence. Hitting people is wrong and children are people too. Try reading Stephen Bavoleks Nurturing Parenting Program materials instead of this trash."
1,* USELESS ITEM *,"This doesn't work AT ALL and is totally WORTHLESS.They shouldn't be ""premitted"" to sell this.All it does is screw up your laptop!"
4,Challenging but worth it,I think the challenge of getting the players to react the way you want them to is half the fun. Good price.
3,Too Hard / Too Easy,"I started out in career mode and the first season was just too difficult and I lost match after match. As someone who knows how to play competive tennis it was near impossible to hit a winner or a passing shot. As I got better it was still hard to hit a good passing shot. After about 2 weeks of playing daily I never had one ace. I got to the point where I could beat players ranked 50 and below with never losing a game, but players ranked 50 or better was impossible they returned every one of my shots. It is a fun game that would make a great rental or if you only want a game that you plan on playing for a week or two. I finally got bored of the game and quit ranked 33rd."
3,not bad,graohically very nice and all! I guess I have been spoiled by Wii! so! the gameplay is no where close to the Wii system! Sorry to be comparing but I think sports game should cannot be played on traditional controls !it takes half off the fun and the Excercise!I would be looking for topspin for Wii! its a waste of time for PS3 or XBox 360
1,Don't buy this,No grab spikes on the end of tape to hold as you reel it out. Dropped it 6' off ladder onto my lawn and it broke. The small zinc split fastener that holds the spring tension snapped. Poor design and quality for the money. Save yourself the aggravation.
1,Dont do it,I bought 3 of these because they were on sale. We have used them all and all 3 have broken. They are not made well. We did not abuse them. They just will not wind up. Dont waste your money. But the tape itself is nice because it is marked on both sides.
3,What does evolution/Darwinism theory have to do with its content?,"Granted, the book was most interesting up to about 85% of it until the author's explanation of WHY, progressed into some disasterous baboon theory. It is understandable that it is very difficult to consider the existence of God after such a horrific decade. It does not give the author an entitlement to this broad analysis of a ""scream theory"", or ""the biosocial roots of human existence"" and better yet that ""behavior specific to man exists within a continuum of life-activities so fundamental and essential to existence that, in one form or another, they may be found throughout the biological realm"" or to ""extopulate a human biogrammer from the activities of PRIMATES ??????????"" And lets not forget the reunion of Darwin with genetics creating some unified theory. Dear Jesus, speak to this man if hopefully he has ears to hear. Otherwise, I couldn't put the book down."
1,Desert Hawk,This book was awful. The typos were distracting and disgraceful but the story telling was much worse. Paying good money for such a shallow and amateur story was too bad. Good lesbian fiction is wonderful to read. This entire story was embarrassing.
2,Interesting Idea for a plot-needs lots of editing,"I started reading this book with great hopes because everyone in my family has been military. The book cost one arm and a leg, but it has a decent cover so I was hopeing for good things. First thing that was a problem was that there is a big space between every paragraph. I suppose with out that, the story would be about 110 pages long. So they are making the book long and charging the big cost when they really should not. Next thing is that the story gets more confusing as you go along with lots of telling and not good showing, and then, to make matters worse, there is an average of 4 typos on every single page. I'm thinking this author needed an editor and just copied up the first draft and printed it. It is from Desktop Publishing, though, so maybe the woudl explain it.Sorry to say, this book isn't really good enough ... It has promise but isn't there yet."
2,Reading Assignment,"I was assigned to read this book for my Human Sexuality class. I hated it. I couldn't get over the fact that I'm pretty sure Keir/Kier (I can't remember) is really mentally challenged and I couldn't finish it. However, the discussion that it raised in the class setting was extremely interesting and insightful. It gets an extra star for that."
2,This book was just annoying,"This book was nothing more than a thorough disapointment. at times, i admit, it was vaguely intriguing, but the inconsistencies ruined it. if kier and gigi had been close friends since they were in kindergarten, then why didn't she know his sister? the writing was mundane and the plot was predictable. in whole, there's nothing special about Inexcusable."
2,The fourth coming of a very medicore game.,"The graphics are super pretty, and the talking characters remind of my friends except they are very strange looking. There is a girl in a bar in this game and I want to date her but she isnt really so im super depressed now. I got a sword as an assassin and i got heavey armor adn the graphics are beaute, but i cant help but to think that microsoft really dropped the ball on this game. What a piece of garbage, its so contrived, everything about this game screams ""been there, done that!"" I hope all of you heed my warnings about this terrible game, however I give it two stars because the graphics are like to die for baby!!!"
1,Its not even out you people are liers!,What do you people think we are 3?how can you have played the game when it hasn't even been released and as for the idiot that said he won it in a contest i doubt betheda would do such a thing...
5,Glittery me.,"I purchased this glitter spray for a Ke$ha concert, :D. I was completely covered in glitter, and so is my bathroom, and my car... but it's cool. It stayed on as long as I wanted it to, and then it washed right off. Yay sparkles..."
5,Funny And Sweet...,"I love this movie. I've watched it several times already and I'm eagerly awaiting a DVD version for my collection. I've generally found Bob Saget to be far more aggravating than humorous in the past, given his inane and incessant rambling on America's Funniest Home Videos. But he really surprised me in this movie, by being extraordinarily funny. This movie alone, has almost made me a fan of his. Saget plays the part of a somewhat inept father, when it comes to the more physical, outdoorsy things. The hilarity ensues, when Saget feels compelled to take his young son on a camping trip. Brian Bonsall does a wonderful job playing Saget's son and to boot he is absolutely one of the cutest young boy actors to ever grace the screen. An entertaining movie that all can enjoy, but perhaps especially great for fathers and sons."
3,KULDA BEEN A LOT BETTA!,"I dunno, the only reason I'm gvin it this many stars is cuz Brian Bonsall, hes a great kid actor. But Bob sagget, not the greatest for the part, but umm, it wasn't THAT bad of a movie, pry kids will like it if they like nature camping and stuff."
2,More Suitable for Math Majors than CS Students,"If you're not very strong in math, take the advice of the reviewer who recommended a companion textbook on Summations and Logarithms. Much of the text and exercises revolve around proofs that might be easily understandable to math majors, but very hard to follow for me (CS major). I would prefer to have more diagrams and less mathematical formulas."
4,a good book but lack of example and hard to read,I was using this book for my algorithm class and found it quite usefull. My only complaint is that this book doesn't have clear example. Most examples were pseudocodes. I prefer to see graphical examples to understand the algorithm concept better.
2,Captivating... Masterful... (unless you have a life),"Though quite thorough, this book is a ""textbook example"" of how boring the subject of computer science can be. Instead of touching on new technologies, such as AI, graphics, or anything else remotely relevant to today's demands on programmers and designers, this book, faithful to its MIT roots, gives a pompous, eggheaded distortion to the field of computers as a whole. Its focus is mainly on such trivialities as algorithm analysis, offering about 10 pages of proofs for each simple assertion. The points that the authors hope to make have no relevance whatsoever in a world in which processor power, not meticulous code optimization, reigns. This book is a waste of matter and not worth the paper it is printed on."
2,"Complete, but examples are poor","I used this book for an Algorithms and Analysis course. While the book does present several interesting algorithms and is very complete, it has some major problems as well, namely with the examples. The book breaks a few of the standard rules I've learned in all other computer science courses. Every other CS course I've has emphasizes that computer scientists count from 0, not 1, when using loop control variables. However, this book ignores that practice and counts from 1. Also, every other CS course has emphasized using descriptive variable names. The pseudocode examples in this book almost always use single letters as names. These two issues combined make the examples clumsy; the reader often has to spend more time figuring out what the variable names mean and adjusting intuitive loop counting than understand how the algorithms work. This book contains a great deal of useful information, but it could be presented more clearly."
2,Too little too late,"Six months ago, as no Cocoon book existed yet, this thin volume could have been interesting, but with the release of Moczar and Aston it is simply not worth the money anymore.It is often rather superficial and is packed with questionnable fillers à la Wrox: one really wonders why the authors and the publisher felt compelled to include useless 'introductions' to css, xhtml and xsl (and more) in a book on cocoon!"
5,I love this book,The pictures and the history are wonderful. Just nake sure to look at the size of the book. The one that I ordered was a the smaller version which makes it difficult to view all of the details in the pictures.
4,Great Reference Book,This is a very good reference book for high school students going into college and college students working on a technical degree. I am an engineer and use it for the math equations I sometimes forget. I would recommend purchasing this book if you work in a technical area.
5,A Handy Mom Guide,"What a handy guide to being a mom! This book is very real life, and who better to get advice from than someone who has first hand experience? Mrs. Burke has reassured me that when taking care of my family, there is no 'by the book', but to do what works for my family and myself. Home is Where the Mom Is has so much information that I haven't put it down since I first bought it years ago. It is a reference book in my home. This book is a must read for all moms, stay at home or not."
4,The Second Sparky Hemingway Story,"I liked this book and I really like Sparky Hemingway, the central character and his girlfriend and his adopted daugher. I didn't have any problem with the various names (and Snake, the name of his dog, was _his_ nickname in Nam, not a friend's nickname)This wasn't exactly a mystery. It has a similar relationship to the mystery genre that the Travis McGee novels do. That isn't a bad thing. The story told by the previous book and this book set up a situation where there could be many more Sparky Hemingway mysteries. Which would be a good thing. Some of them might be more tradional whodunits.On the other hand, I don't know that the books have found an audience. If they haven't, Joel will probably go back to writing SF and Fantasy. So I win either way."
3,Does Family Matters matter?,"I bought this book thinking it was written by Joel C. Rosenberg. Actually, it was Joel (without a C.) Rosenberg. It is an OK book in a quirky sort of way, with no real point other than having a lifetime bond with your former tank crew from Vietnam can complicate an otherwise boring life in a small town in North Dakota. The book has some amusing moments, but would have been far more enjoyable without the off-color language that pervades nearly every page. You can best gauge the pace of this book by knowing that the most memorable character is ""Snake"", a really laid-back German Shepard that spends most of its time taking ""dumps"". To sum it up in ""Seinfeld terms"" Family Matters is basically a book about nothing."
3,It gets the job done,"I had to tap it a few times to get it to light up, but when it gets going it works very well. I put it insde my camper while sitting outside by the fire and a few hours later it was loaded with dead mosquitos. After going to bed I was not bitten once."
2,Not via Kindle,Exactly the book I was looking for but it was a mistake to purchase it via Kindle. Some of the recipes are in very small type and unreadable on the Kindle screen even using the largest font selection.The actual book would have been a better purchase.
1,This is the most ugly kittin ive ever seen! (And i LOVE cats!),"Hi, first of all.. Me and my sis LOVE cats and we were looking for some kitten toys and we were looking and saw this...this..THING!!!!!! It looks sick! We have an adorable kittin named George and she's 9999999,000000 times cuter than this so called kittin!!!! It looks like zombie! Ewwww....This is SO SO SO SO ICKY!!!!!!! DONT BUY THIS YOULL PROBALLY HAVE NIGHT MEERS!!!!!! But DO buy this Its called Kittens in a basket and its only 30.00 Annd this sick thing is 34.00! They should pay you 34.00 dollers cause its SO SO SO SO UGLY!!!!!!!! Well i better go now so bye!-Jackie p.s DONT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!"
1,Deeply Dissapointing,"If you are buying this book hoping to find worthwhile discussion and insight on strategy and techniques for creating and deploying mobile learning-solutions, look elsewhere.If on the other hand you know nothing about MP3 players, GPS, PDAs and camcorders, and would like a light-weight technology primer heavily padded out with unnecessary screenshots and interviews, this book is definitely for you."
5,May you be touched by His noodly appendages,"This is science, religion, satire and truth all in one. It makes fully as much sense as traditional religion, far more sense than traditional science and it totally outclasses Congress and the US Senate. There is real truth here. Be careful, though. If you read this book, you will be converted. I know I was. I am now a true Pastafarian."
3,meh,"I was hoping that this book would have been funnier. Overall, while the idea is amusing, I didn't find too many points to be that funny, and I was ready to be finished with the book before the end."
3,not yet... but just now....,"Okay, So I have heard about this book since it was first published, and because of my contrary nature, have neglected to buy and read it... anything that gets wide praise quickly, generally goes on a back burner for me... it's true. But after MUCH deliberation I have decided to go ahead and heed the reviews and let this work become a part of me. The reviews I have heard by word of mouth surpass even those found here and they come from some very credible sources (physicists and one rocket scientist included- seriously) So, it is with these words that I click view cart to be followed by secure checkout... happily. I will update with my personal take once received and digested."
2,"Read the ""Book of the Subgenius"" instead.","FSM=Funny for your educated, liberal parents. The satire is tame: about what one would expect from ""an out of work physicist"". Preach the gospel of Bob Dobbs, Salesmen to the gods! Revel in Bull-dada, excremeditation, and win back your slack!"
5,a,"For all of you who have'nt noticed, we are all made out of pasta, just looking at DNA gives us suffitiant proof."
5,Exceeded expectations,"This is a beautiful book, rich in humor and satire.Just upon reading the first page, and scanning through reading side notes, it is easy to tell this is a book that will be easily enjoyable for a long time."
5,The one true god is finally known to all !!!,"As a long time FSM convert I can testify that when one is touched by the true god's noodles or tasted the bounty his Meatballness offers all free, you will forever be changed. Come forward all of you lost people and discover the truth that will set you free.The FSM view of creation must be taught in our public schools and our laws must be changed to allow everyone to find out how the one true god created mankind - evolution is a bunch of voodoo crap, and Intelligent Design is just a branch off the same decayed tree of lies."
5,Truly Inspirational,"As a residential landscape designer I am so inspired by this book. Besides the wonderful pictures, the author offers a thorough explanation of materials needed and the steps it takes to build a terraced landscape. The designs range from a single raised bed to magnificent, terraced front and back yards. Mr. Nordmark really does use his ""God-given creative talents"" to create gorgeous landscapes."
1,A really lousy book,"This book was not too ""inspiring"". The entire book seemed to be 5 or 6 different plans in fifty different applications with pre-fab bricks that look like they came from Home Depot. The plan is to take this and slap them together with adhesive(???). The writer thinks he is more clever than everyone else in the world for his adhesive plan. More clever than the people who manufacture the brick products? Um, okay. I mean, you wouldn't want them telling you how to use their products. What do they know?When I saw the price for most copies of this book, I thought it would be some fabulous book with coffee table capabilities when I was done with it. I didn't pay much for my used copy, and I'm sure glad I didn't pay any more.What the heck? Wish I could give it a negative star. I really don't get all the great reviews."
1,VERY UNINSPIRING!,This book was more like a pamphlet from the brick manufacturer.As another reviewer noted the quality of the pictures was awful!And the landscapes that the awful pictures depicted were almost all the same. Just variations of the same idea. I expected a book that would show many different materials and ideas (hard scaping and landscaping) and instead got this elementary block stacking book that looks like it would be given away free at your hardware store when you buy a bucket of paint.
2,Terracing using bricks.,Nordmark only uses pre-cast stones (big pastel colored brick like things) to build terraces. No other materials are used. No details about drainage. You may want to look at his work before you buy...
1,Simply uninspirational,"The whole book contains only excessive use of precasted retaining wall blocks, tons and tons of them running everywhere and nothing else. Inside you'll find lots of pictures which are really just variations similar to the cover page, lots of them are of blurry kind. I have used both dry laid stone and precasted concrete and both can make beautiful design. Problem of his design is the excessiveness. It is like having Home Depot do you whole house. This book is truly embarrassing.For something actually inspiring, look for 'Hillside Landscaping' by Susan Lang."
1,Bizarrely awful,Jumps all over the screen randomly. Both my Vista computers stopped recognizing it when plugged in as USB after a Vista update.
1,Doesn't work. POS.,"As other reviewers here note, the cursor frequently and unpredictably jumps to the corners of the screen in the absence of input from the user. I have tested two different mice on two different stone cold, ""stock"" Windows XP systems, using either PS/2, USB1 or USB2 connections, and all configurations similarly malfunction. I did get a different result, however, when I plugged it into a Windows 2000 box: it crashed the system. Truly, amazingly, god-awful. Hello, Microsoft, anybody home? (I guess the people developing and testing this product were all too busy building their Lake Washington mansions, or their Sun Valley vacation homes, or their Maui vacation homes, or their Montana ranches, or tuning their Porsche GT3s to worry over something as simple as a mouse.)"
2,"Accurate, responsive and cheap",I have a more expensive microsoft optical mouse at home and I really like it. I decided to buy a second one for work to replace my mechanical mouse and decided to go with the cheapest version becuase how different can they be.Well it turns out that they are very different. I have no problems with the speed and accuracy but the mouse itself is so light that the cable pull becomes really annoying and you feel that you are constantly fighting it.Next time I will spend a little more to get the one model up.
3,Historically interesting,"This was a book club pick and would not have been a choice of mine.However, I started reading it and while finding the setting of 15th Century Italy some what interesting the characters were too hard to keep track of. I found myself going back and forth just to keep them straight.I suppose if I sat down and read it all at once it would have been easier. Just not a pick-up and read when you have a chance."
3,Larger than expected.,Have not installed because I don't really want to cut out the dash enough to mount it. Looks good.
3,a hero of this genre,"DONOVAN is a solid actioner from this very dependable Western writer. Clabe Donovan, an outlaw thought long dead, may be alive and killing the citizens of Dry Fork. Sheriff Webb Matlock must journey to Mexico to find Donovan and bring him back to face justice. Complicating matters is Webb's love for Donovan's widow Ellie. Most of the book is a chase, but Kelton has the ability to write tender moments too, and draws all his characters in fine economical prose.If you like DONOVAN, check out GOOD OLD BOYS, a lamentation for the passing of the Old West. Recommended...."
1,Wrong picture of the item shown!!,SW5630 is not a switch but a control module. Amazon needs to fix the part number of the change the picture.
1,Unit is possessed!,"This unit works horribly. Since the moment that I have installed it, it turns its self on by its self and when ever it wants. If i leave the house, i can come back to find the fan working on full speed with the light on. I tried taking the battery out of the remote to see if that did anything, and it still would turn its self on. Sometimes it turns its self off too, or will start to dim the lights. I asked my neighbors if they had any remote systems, and none of them do. I am not sure what to do at this point, maybe invest in something else and see if that works."
1,Beware!,"Yes, this dimmer works great and is a fantastic way to control both the lights and fan remotely. In fact, it was the only way we could have a dimmer on the overhead lights in our children's rooms as well as have controls for the fans. However, if your power goes out, when it comes back on, the overhead lights go on full-power. This means that if the power flickers in the middle of the night, the lights come on full-blast. This has woken my entire family on more than one occasion. If you purchase this product, be prepared to remember to turn of the switch behind the remote every night (this means that you can't leave the fan on overnight). I contacted Hunter and they say that this is how the unit is supposed to function and would not offer any sort of solution or refund."
2,Hunter Fan/Light Remote Control #27148 - Mind Of Its Own,"My husband and I bought this remote control along with a Hunter Fan, installed it, and ever since, the fan AND light have a mind of their own. At random times during the day and night the fan and/or light or both will turn on for no reason at all. We did a little test where we changed the frequency on the transmitter first to see if that was what was causing the problem. Theoretically the transmitter shouldn't have been communicating with the receiver since they were on separate frequencies. As usual, the fan and light turned on for no reason at all. So, the problem isn't the transmitter alone. Its either a bad receiver or just RF interference. This weekend we're going to change the frequencies on both the transmitter and receiver to see if this works but after reading other reviews on a different model #, this doesn't sound like it'll do the trick. We shall see....Muhhahahhahha."
1,Disappointed,"The title of this book sounded really funny and I/we were prepared to have a lot of laughs, but as soon as I thumbed through the book I had wanted to give to my son for his birthday, I realized the thoughts and jokes in it were totally inappropriate - not only for a gift for my son, but to share with any of the people I associate with - and we're fun-loving people who love to laugh. The content and the language in the book were not reflective of how I and my friends and family think or talk - so I returned the book and thank you for the credit on my billing."
4,Hysterically Funny,"This book is hysterically funny--expecially if you have already reached ""middle-age"". The content is extremely on-point and accurate. I mean, when (and where) does one note when she buys her first pair of elastic-jeans and when was the first time you coughed or sneezed and lost a tiny little bit of your bladder. These are significant points in reaching middle age. Quick perusal will bring you to tears!Recommended for all over 45 and definitely a wonderful gift for anyone turning 40 OR 50"
2,Do they remember that day the sun went out???????,"Boy sets fire, what happened to you my dear friends, did it have to come to THIS!!! Talk about a radio friendly half hearted waste of plastic. Ever since the first day i hear ""the day the sun went out"" I thought they and, of course Shai hulud were it. Only one has stayed true and sadly its not bsf. After the eulogy was OK, it had its moments, i liked the heart peeking through in my life in the knife trade, and the fist in the air sing song of the track eulogy. But this album has none of that, i felt as if i should throw on a BSF shirt and hang out at the mall or something. This is not the deleware hXc we all used to know and love, this is mall metal weve all learned to hate, im lookin forward to your tour with papa roach nate and co.PiceMike"
2,"Ok mix, but cut off some tracks","While the overall mix of the album was ok, they cut off some tracks, such as Around the World. This makes one wonder if they did so to others. The overall effect was one of a sampler CD of some great artists. There are better compilation albums out there, take time and look."
2,"Well, Its OK, But...","This compilation is not that good. First, the remixes are extremely strange and annoying. About three songs are in their original versions. The other were remixed and the production/recording work of these remixes are not that good, especially Inmsonia (supposedly by Faithless). Overall, some of the songs date back to 1995 and 1996. Furthermore, the artists' names are not listed, which is extremely annoying. Down to the essentials, this compilation is not that good, period."
4,review of gift of software,I purchased this software as a Christmas gift and the person that I gave it to is very satisfied with the software. This software is mac software for the mac computer.
2,Not an Office substitute,"This program is great... if you are operating in an environment full of Mac users or not trading files with anyone at all. When it comes to working with Microsoft files (which dominate the rest of the working and academic world) this package falls flat. Formatting goes missing, documents look funny, and nothing is ever quite the way you expected it to be.I have one word for Office users moving to Mac: DON'T. Shell out the extra cash for Office 2008 for Mac."
3,Disappointed,The old Appleworks 6 had a n easy to use database. The iWorks is akin to Microsoft Works- the database is incorporated into the spreadsheet.
4,Very good but still lacking support of RTL languages,"It is an excellent little cheap office suite. Offers a quite good compatibility with MS Office and remains powerful enough for a lot of jobs, with an interface really more intuitive, simple and easy-to-use than OpenOffice.But this 3rd version is still lacking of good support with RTL languages wich is a pitty since TextEdit and almost all Cocoa softwares support them quite well. Also it is a pity because it as better support of MS Word and better desktop publishing functions than Mellel."
2,You Can't Email The Files!,"I love Mac, OK, but not being able to email a file is a HUGE overlook!!I just typed up a PAGES document and I can't Gmail it or send it via Webmail. I'm upset.SO WHAT if it's compatible with other programs unless it can be sent to people with those other programs! Thats the main reason that compatability is important in my opinion.Don't get me wrong, it is a great program. Pretty intuitive actually. But as far as business is concerned...........big pain in the ButI just bought the iWork and I needed to type up a proposal ASAP."
4,great software,This was a great value since I didn't want to pay for the newer version. Does what I need it to do.
5,excellent price excellent software,"I bought this item after purchasing it on e-bay. It came from e-bay without a box, without instructions, without help from Apple. True it was only $20, but I learned a lesson. Never again will i buy from any source if Amazon has it. From Amazon it came in a box with reg. #. I was able to install it easy, and even update it from Apple without a hitch. Excellent Price, excellent software."
5,Excellent Office Suite for Macs!,"WOW! I was really, pleasantly surprised at how refined and well-executed this suite is. FAR more intuitive than Microsoft Office, with intuitive controls, excellent formatting, and very aesthetically pleasing results. I haven't tested the MS Office compatibility yet, but others are reporting decent compatibility. Plus, it is a Cocoa-based application suite (meaning it is very well integrated with OS X), and ""feels"" great to use.Strongly recommended!"
3,it serves its purpose,"I was unable to get the fold lines out of it, I used an iron, I used the drier with a wet towel,,, no luck. It worked though and we played a decent game of Texas Holdem without the cards slipping off the polished wood table."
3,this is not a brushed felt table top!,"we thought this was going to be a brushed felt table top, but it wasn't. however, it was cheap and perfect for application to some plywood for a DIY poker table project we had."
5,I LOVE IT,im not gonna type my heart out telling you about George jones he is a icon and leaving legend in country music he is the best!
1,Do Not Order This!,"The photo makes you think you are getting a rectangular tent footprint, but instead you get a ground cloth sized and shaped like a mummy-style sleeping bag. This is a bait and switch by the vendor, who also overcharge for shipping ($8 shipping for a basic padded envelop mailed one state away--what a rip off!)"
3,It's a Tool,"I have two wooden stools and for some reason the screws come loose all the time. We've tightened them very tight yet days later...yes days later they come loose again. It's pathetic. Well I couldn't find the Allen wrenches i had specifically for the stools so I ordered these. I have yet to test them all out but IT""S A TOOL. It works. I love the different sizes so i won't have a problem using them.I just don't like the holder much. when you open the holder the hex keys slant and some come out and I have to put them back in. If the holder was more of a case then it would be better to handle them. I put a 3 star because of the above reasons but If I lost this set, I'd buy another one, so yes i recommend them."
1,Final Fiasco,"After playing FFX, and then using the strategy guide, I found it more confusing on my second runthrough with the game. The wording and mapping is terrible, don't waste your money, buy lord of the rings instead."
2,Not really necessary,"This strategy guide is not really necessary. I played quite a few Final Fantasy PlayStation games and what little guiding you need can be found for free online. The overall game is pretty straightforward so hardly needed it. I would suggest the guide only for Final Fantasy X-2 because if you don't do things in the right order you can miss the vast majority of the game or die really quickly. However, strategy guides always take a bit away from the actual fun. I like to play games that really do not need them."
3,It was okay,"This was pretty good. It had some inconsistencies, but I got it back in '01, so that's not too bad."
4,Final Fantasy X...Better Than VII?,"When I first bought this book, I was stuck in Mushroom Rock Road at the sinspawn fight. After I bought this book, I have gotten about halfway through the game after starting over again. This is really a good book if you don't mind stuff like ""For more information about loaning money to O'aka, turn to the ""Shops"" section of this guide."" That can get kind of annoying after a while. Also, it does not explain the training arena in the Calm Lands very well; an FAQ online at gamefaqs.com really helps on that, though. And the directions to solve the Cloister of Trials are rather vague, and very confusing for the one where you get Bahamut. But overall, this is a very good guide for a very good PS2 game. The Blitzball character section at the back is especially helpful.Ryja y kuut tyo, yht ihdem haqd desa, rybbo kysehk!(Just in case you're wondering, that's the in-game language, Al Bhed, for ""have a good day, and until next time, happy gaming!)"
4,FFX Official Strategy Guide for PS2 is Great!,The FFX Official Straegy Guide for PS2 systems lets the player guide very involved in the game. I have played for over 140 hours and still haven't accomplished everything in the book. The strategy guide keeps you informed without revealing the storyline. I would buy other Bradygame guides based on my exerience with this one.
1,well once again a.m.c. gives us inferior prints,"the one a.m.c. disc i got that was good must have been a mistake, because this one is back to their normal quality(cut prints,sound drop outs,poor video,and a general lack of care for product or the coustmer)!!!! once again you can find better at other collections."
1,faulty switch,"I have this flashlight and used it while on-duty as a police officer. Shortly after purchasing it from a local police uniform store, the switch became faulty and would only function properly intermittently. Sometimes it wont turn on and at times it wont turn off when clicking the switch. I turned it in for repair and when I got it back everything was fine for a while until the flashlight would turn on by itself when inverted. This was a huge officer safety issue when I have the flashlight holstered on my duty belt. It would turn on by itself when walking or sitting in the car thus exposing me in the dark. I've been using my other Streamlight UltraStringer and no problems with that except the battery life seems much shorter. I'm going to try the Streamlight Stinger (non LED) next and hope that's better than the ones I already have."
3,I Should Have Paid Attention To The Less Than Stellar Reviews,"Excellent compilation of well written essays on the history of Spain. Comprehensive and succint, but boring as all get out. Having trouble with insomnia? Then give this book a try. I was hoping to get a grasp on Spanish history and this book certanly made me aware of the complexities, but it did nothing to ease the burden that the lay reader faces on the subject. I would recommend this book as a reference but not as a starting point or a casual read, despite its relative brevity. Those with a stronger background on the subject may have more of an appreciation."
1,Great Expectations,I bought this book for my Russian daughter-in-law who had little knowledge of Spanish history. I also hoped for an update on my own knowledge. Both of us were disappointed. Indeed such was the masking of basic facts that I found myself acting as teacher to an avid intelligent puipil. Perhaps I should have known that a composite history of this type was bound to fail because in this day & age no academic is going to subordinate his opportunity to shine as against subordinating his ego to honest scholastic team work.
5,GREAT CD,THIS IS A GREAT CDBEST SONGS ARELEMON-AIDIVE BEEN UP THESE STEPSOH ELLINMING TRANGIVE UP THE GRUDGEI HEAR YOU CALLINGIF YOU LIKE THIS CD THEN YOU SHOULD GET GOB: F.U.E.P
3,Cult Classics: To Each Their Own.,"Cult Classics, Vol. 2 contains the kind of films that are best viewed on a rainy night. Atmospheric horror classics, Saturday matinee spook fest..Pure fun, more schlock then scares but schlock is what sold in the 60's and even the 70's."
5,Great Ball,"I bought this as an xmas gift not really knowing anything about volleyballs. A friend had asked for one for xmas and after browsing around and reading the reviews this looked like a great quality ball. It is a bit pricier than others, but I'm very happy I went with this as she was impressed and said it was a great pick. Very light and soft. Arrived earlier than expected even during the holiday season."
4,Interesting Reading!!!!,"This is Art Bell's first book, and it is his autobiography. Art is the former host of the worldwide radio programs Coast to Coast AM and Dreamland. If I weren't in the radio broadcasting business myself, I would probably say that this is a fascinating story. But, it turned out to be quite what I expected from a fellow broadcaster. Nonetheless, it is interesting to get to know the man behind the voice that I was so accustomed to hearing night after night. Besides his childhood, education, domestic life, and career, Art discusses how he used to get callers and guests to talk on the air, and even relates his feelings toward what he heard and was broadcasting. This is good reading for Art Bell fans or for those interested in the radio broadcasting business."
1,This book blows,"Art Bell, the purveyer of the absurd, has out-done himself this time. This so called autobiography is every bit as sensational as his ridiculous, bizzare radio program which pollutes the airwaves six nights a week. If you are one of the poor souls who believe there are little green men from mars among us, by all means run don't walk to by this book."
2,Don't waste your money,Not very happy with this - you can find better stuff for free on the internet. Don't waste your money.
3,great quality and service,I received my order when expected and not only was this a gift it was a perfect throwback surprise for a relative who hasn't seen this in years and couldn't find it for anywhere.... Thnx again
3,When does it start to Glow,"The net itself looks good, but I've only had it for two days, and I never saw it glow at night. I installed it the day before, so it had all day in the sun to charge or what ever it does. Was expecting it to glow in the dark, but nothing yet. If it don't start glowing in the next day or so, I'm sending it back!"
3,Good but inconclusive,"I have read Aurthur Koestlers ""The 13th Tribe"" and other stories about Khazars. Brooks book is more detailed. The problem is that jews from Russia look much different than Jews from Germany. Jews from Spain look much different than Jews from Yemen. Many people might think of Turks as a people with Asian features. Actually many Turks have 100% European features. No one really knows though what the Khazars looked like. Also no one has been able to truly trace the Khazars travel after the Russian annihalation of the Khazars. There was also an admixture of many people in Eastern Europe, meaning the remaining Khazars simply may have mixed to the point of completling disappearing. The book is good an interesting but the only way we will really know about Khazars is through DNA testing."
5,Beautiful!,"This is exactly the kind of music I have been waiting for since Dillinger screwed the pooch. The technicality is great. What an amazing guitarist & drummer. This is more along the lines of extreme metal than tech. The murderistic screaming is what gets me. Congrats on a great album.. To me, this is one for the ages. Will not disappoint ( if you can handle it )."
4,Pretty good,"I think it leaves a bit of residue, but it works wonderfully. So far my experience with this item has been positive. It's what I needed for cheaper."
1,"Didn't help at all, slow shipping, and very poor packaging","I have a synthetic wig with a lot of snarls. It is actually higher quality than the typical Halloween wig and cost about $60 as a point of reference. This conditioner did almost nothing to either remove existing small snarls or prevent new ones. Furthermore, this aerosol came in a simple box with no packing and it took forever to arrive. I'm amazed it did not explode in transit, but still feel the shipping was careless."
5,Great Live Foghat,"DECADES LIVE combines great live music from several Foghat tours. The music is all top-rate, even though 1977's FOGHAT LIVE remains the definitive live document of this great band. If you love FOOL FOR THE CITY, FOGHAT LIVE, NIGHT SHIFT, ENERGIZED, ROCK AND ROLL OUTLAWS, AKA ROCK AND ROLL, and ROAD CASES, you'll love DECADES LIVE."
5,Foghat live-need I say more?,"Needless to say that the true value of a band is how they play live & fortunately Foghat 'was' 'the' live band. This cd captures what is was like to be there...just straight ahead, good clean rock & roll boogie, Has all the big songs, if your a die hard Foghat fan, pick up this cd, you'll be glad you did"
5,Tissot mens watch review,"The watch came in PERFECT condition! They provided fast delivery! I ordered it right before Christmas, and it arrived in 3 days! It is a very reliable goodlooking watch."
1,don't blow on it,this tent is so light weight that if a small wind comes the tent will go down. it would be great inside a house. i returned it
2,Broke after 5 uses,"I bought this tent about 6 months ago to put up as a vendor at flea markets and craft fairs. I chose this tent because it seemed to be higher quality and I wanted to invest in a quality tent that would last a while rather than buying a cheap ""backyard gazebo type"" at walmart or costco. This tent is very difficult to put up - even with 2 people. After 3 uses, the plastic covers of the buttons on the legs broke off, after 5 uses, one of the stabilzation bars snapped when putting it up and I've had to tape it, but if a gust of wind comes, the whole thing starts to collapse.If I can return it I will..so much for spending extra for a ""good"" tent!!"
2,What was that cracking sound?,One of the corner roof support pieces broke during my third erection. Was able to Jerry-rig a solution but shouldn't have had to. Finding replacement parts is proving difficult.
1,Piece of junk and no parts available,"I bought this and used it once tailgating when the wind broke a cross brace. When I e-mailed the company to buy a replacement part, here was their response...""I am sorry to hear about your canopy. Unfortunately we do not have replacement parts for that particular canopy. In fact, there aren't parts made for it at all. I am very sorry that the pieces broke. If there is anything else we can do to help you please let us know""I will never buy another Swissgear or Wenger product again and suggest a Caravan Canopy or any other well made canopy that is stood behind by the company that makes it. Don't waste you money on this one!"
1,Broke in 60 days,We used this in our yard 3 times to cover a craft project my wife was working on. It was outside for a total of 4 days and one light rain. The tent imploded and the metal frame broke. Completely unfixable and heading for the trash. I paid extra for this product thinking that it was high quality. I was wrong.
3,Not a White Canopy,I purchased this canopy to use at an art fair. I opened the box and quickly realized that the canopy was not white. It was actually a soft metallic grey. I put it right back in the box and returned. I truly cannot speak of the quality of the product as I didn't use it.
3,Good Value!,"I would say the product met most of my expectations. With exception that I thought it would be a little more like the E-Z Pop-up Tent type. for the cost it was a good buy. Once the frame was set-up, the center portion of the unit had to be pushed up, which if you are a short person this can be a problem. It did have a very good carry case. Also it was delivered in short order, I was impress.J.Perez"
5,Great Buy,"I ordered this tent to use for an exhibit at a festival. It is more sturdy than most I have seen and it keeps the rain off. Two of us put the tent up for the first time in about 15 minutes. I doubt that I would be able to get it put together by myself, but since I don't ever plan on doing it by myself, I am very pleased with it. It certainly did the job."
1,"cheap, don't buy",I was very disappointed when I received this product. I wanted to give it as a gift but it is so low quality I would be embarrassed to give it to anyone. It looks like something you would get at the dollar store :(
2,Didn't hold up well,"I bought this backpack for my son and a week after school started the metal tabs at the end of the straps had fallen off, which means every time he puts it on the adjustable straps do not stay in place and he ends up having to carry it rather then wear it on his back. The straps also are now completely unraveled and this backpack is useless less then a month into the school year, we have already had to purchase a new backpack."
1,Conjecture and huge leaps of logic,"I suppose the best one can say about Griffin's The Holy Grail: The Legend, the History, the Evidence is that at least it provides an interested reader with a basic Grail vocabulary. And it's short. That's the good news. The bad news is that Griffin stretches remote possibility/hearsay-types of anecdotes and tries to represent them as facts. Lots of passive voice (""it has been determined that..."" or ""it is thought that...""), absolutely no direct source citation for his ""facts."" The bibliography at the back is no substitute for solid in-text source citation to substantiate every assertion! My conclusion: When you try to concretize a metaphor, all you end up with is nebulous, dubious, unsubstantiated speculation disguised as historical inquiry (for example, check out Griffin's ""analysis"" of Longinus's spear, or the ""findings"" of St. Helena in Jesus's tomb). Skip this book."

2,Not all it could have been,"This book is far, far, far from what it could have been. Yes, there is some interesting thought here but not enough for 197 pages. This book is definitely not for the average Evangelical but useful for the scholarly Evangelicals. C. R Biggs ""Biggsman"" review will be better than the book for many people."
1,Do NOT do business with Bargaincell!!,"Bought a cell phone battery that, of course, died one week past their return/refund deadline. Refused to refund or replace even though the product is CLEARLY defective. This company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again. Consider yourself warned."
1,You get what you pay for,"This battery charger broke in a week or two, just stopped working. I paid nearly nothing for it. The shipping cost more than the item."
3,More Toy than Teether,"My children are 7 months old. They both love when this toy is pulled out though I find that they prefer to play with it and see it move around more than use it for teething. This isn't a bad thing, just saying."
2,teether,Product not up to expectations-didn't rattle but too much trouble to return for price. Looks like rattle pieces got glued inside plastic parts of rattle.
4,Cute!,The rattle is not really a rattle to me but the different surfaces for my 8 month old teether is really good.
2,Hard for kids below 6months,This toy looks good and was ok to hold. Its too hard for babies below 6months. I might not give it to the child unless he is 1 year or more.
3,cool teether,"I like this teether the color and the 8shape are so cool and your baby can play with it as a toy,but my girl dosen't like it."
2,too big and too heavy for my 6-month-old baby to hold,"it is too big and too heavy for my 6-month-old baby to hold, and also the materials seem too hard for my baby to chew. My baby himself is not interested in it. a bad buy."
4,Keeps his hands busy more than used as a teether,"Our son put this toy in his mouth a bit when we first got it when he was about 4 months (started teething at 4.5). Since then (he is 6 months and 3 teeth later), this toy keeps his hands busier than it does soothing his sore gums. Still a good buy in my mind."
3,Too large for my baby,"I quite like this teether, but unfortunately, it is not suitable for my 9 month old. She has hardly used it at all as it won't fit in her mouth. Looks pretty but totally inappropriate in terms of functionality."
2,"It's alright, my daughter just isnt interested","My teething daughter doesnt care very much for this teether. There is hardly any rubber on it (which is what she likes to naw on most), and the teether is a little too thick for her to put in her mouth and chew on. Its just nothing special.. not even for the price."
2,Kindle version is the public domain edition from 100 years ago,"Warning - the Kindle edition should not be listed under this heading because it is not the 17th edition edited by Kaplan but a public domain edition from at least 1920 if not earlier. Also as the other reviewers have noted, there are no indexed links to the quotes."
2,I regret buying for Kindle,"I'm sorry I bought the Kindle edition of this book.First, as was warned, Lincoln is not here. Incredible. What else is missing?Second. Okay, there's an index. I expect it from a book like this. It helps browsing (you might disagree). But try Angels: are painted. Click the page number. The link is to page 183 as I remember. The quotation is not there! In fact it's 50-odd pages back. An index that does not index is a fraud.[...]"
2,"Excellent text, but errors galore in the answers to the exercises","I'm using this book to review Linear Algebra, having been away for quite some time. The basic text is easy to follow, and the ideas are clearly explained. But the amount of errors in the answers to the exercises are totally unacceptable. If I was a teacher again (which I was years ago) and a student turned in this quality of work for the exercises, they would get a failing grade. The typos and errors really are that bad. I have found that I do not trust the answers given in the book, as I am using my computer to do the math to double check my practice. I absolutely have to agree with others, the book itself is good, but the answers to the exercises are so bad that I can not recommend this book, which is unfortunate as the explanations of Linear Algebra are actually quite good."
3,Good resource - not up to Schaum Outline standard but good,"As others have noted there are simple mistakes - I was suprised at the first few early ones I found (addition mistakes, mixing variables). I almost got another book based on other reviews to supplement my course text (Anton's which is pathetic), but overall the Schaum's Outlines have been very good for me and ultimately this one did have enough examples to be helpful.Not as helpful as many of the other Schaum Outlines but I'm not terribly disappointed as I feared based on other reviews."
4,Very nice book for theory review,"I would say that the structure of this book pleased me. I used it as a theory review for my qualifying exam in Linear Algebra. For that purpose it served quite well. It has a nice, constructive structure. It will make your knowledge organized and will not overload you with too much abstractions. Especially I enjoyed the fact that definitions and key theorems are situated separately from their proofs, that allow you to familiarize yourself with theory in general and after you know everything there, you may concentrate on the proofs to make your knowledge more sophisticated. At least this is the way how I did work with this book. As for exercises, they are not very difficult, I would say undergraduate level only, so that it is good for those who has a weak knowledge in this subject. For those who want to go beyond Linear Algebra I would suggest Kostrykin, 3 volumes, but it is in Russian ;-)"
1,Socialist unrealism,"Schoenman proves once again that it is possible to create a fantasy world of monsters where none exists by shading the truth, clever inventions and repetition of polemics. Anyone who wants a good ""hate Israel"" book should definitely buy this one, but they should bear in mind that they are reading a work of fiction.The ""Hidden History"" is not really hidden of course. The same charges have been leveled repeatedly by Norman Finkelstein, Noam Chomsky, Ben Hecht and many others, and they have also been refuted. Some of them, such as allegations of Zionist ""treachery"" in the Holocaust were refuted in court. It is very hard to kill a lie unfortunately."
1,false propoganda,"Richard Schoenman is a master of reconstructionist history. Using ten percent truth and ninety percent rumor Schoenman builds a fictionized history that serves his larger Communist/Stalinist agenda. According to Schoenman Israel/Zionism and America are responsible for all of the this centuries' evils, including the Holocaust and the horror of 911 (yes, the Mossad and CIA planned it, in his opinion, and the Arabs are innocent!). All those who believe in decency and the sanctity of history should stand up and condemn Schoenman for his irresponsible journalism and hate-baiting fiction. His arguments may pass muster in a middle east consumed in denial and anti-semitism but should not be given one moment of serious attention here."
1,Good idea ... just doesn't receive atomic time easily,I bought two of these and they both have an extremely hard time receiving an atomic time signal from the clock at Boulder Colorado. They are lucky to update their time once a week. I have 6 atomic clocks manufactured by another company throughout my house and they all work fine. I would not recommend purchase.
1,WARNING TO PARENTS,This game scores points if you shoot cops and even more if you grab an innocent person off the street and use them as a human shield.
1,Stop Selling This at Amazon,"I love Amazon...but I am greatly disturbed that Amazon would be willing to profit from the sale of Cop-killing video games. Quite honestly, I expect more from a quality corporate citizen such as Amazon. Supporting ""25 to Life"" is disturbing. I am a huge supporter of freedom of choice in this nation. Perhaps Amazon is using this ""rationale"" to somehow justify selling this cop-killing game. But any responsible retailer or reseller should put common decency ahead of profits. Until Amazon puts that decency ahead of cop-killer video games I will not purchase any goods from Amazon.com."
4,Sizzlin'!,"With the exception of Paul Hardcastle's Jazzmasters, Fattburger is my favorite smooth jazz group. Sizzlin' is another fine CD, but the only outstanding melody is the title track."

3,Not as much zing.,"It's been 2 years since we last met up with the Baranov Royal family and there've been some changes. King Al is no longer mooning over Queen Elizabeth II but has transferred his affections to Princess Christina's mother and Princess Alexandria is now a victim of post traumatic stress after an incident which occurred in the 1st book. Her father, the ever hysterical King (our personal favourite character) suggests that she get away from it all by visiting an aquarium in North Dakota.One irate marine biologist later and Alexandria is too busy fighting and flirting to worry about her problems. Dr Shel Rivers has nothing but contempt for royalty, dismissing them all as spoiled and arrogant and no one, not even a tempting, sassy redhead is going to make him change her mind, no matter how soft her lips are. Watch the sparks fly as stubborn meets determined."
2,A rare miss for an otherwise stellar author,"Hmm...I'm trying to think of an apt desciption for this book. Oh, got it!Do you remember that Friends episode about the guys' friend Gandolf coming to visit? They were so stoked, envisioning the best night of their lives. And then he didn't show. Yeah...that's what reading this book was like after reading The Royal Treatment. Such high hopes that weren't realized.Princess Alexandria has the be the most boring tormented soul I've ever read. Seriously, she could have walked her insomniac butt of an Alaskan pier and I wouldn't have noticed that she was missing. And Shel? Well there is a fine line between romantic conflict and out-right personality disorder.The Teal/Jenny plot was the most interesting part, in my opinion. But that disappeared quicker than you can say ""Um, but you said he was gay."""
3,Enjoyable and Funny.....................,"After reading this hilarious sequel I can't wait for the third book in this crazy series. My only fault not much of conflict material. Sheldon and Alex were destined to be together, I will not into summation, just say that I almost fell out of my bed laughing. I also want the King to find a new Queen who's just as crazy as he is. MJD is a very talented writer and I'll know that the more she writes the better she'll become"
3,Could Be Better,"The title will get your attention but all the numbers will run together after awhile.It does have it's merits as the author details his life in the maintenance divison.The awful job of cleaning out a tank with the blood/tissue from battlefield casualties,a smell that never leaves that particular vehicle.And over & over to the point the story just repeats itself.I really had to struggle to finish this book."
1,"Too much fiction, not enough history","I'll keep mine simple, as Robert Forczyk already provided an excellent review. This work is more a work of fiction than history, and I was sorely disappointed in the content. Of interest, I had spoken to one of the reviewers who is quoted on the dust jacket and he told me that he had not endorsed the book in entirety, but the publisher cherry-picked a quote from his review to buttress it. For additional points see my comment I attached to R.Forczyk's one star review."
4,like a familiar friend ...,"Agnetha's voice is well suited for this genre...and she has one of the most beautiful voices ever. She doesn't quite show her range, however, in these arrangements but this is still something I can listen to over and over again. I would like to hear more from her; I've missed her."
5,MORE THAN EXCPECTED,"the was better than it described , i really happy for having the book immiditly . i would like to order from you again ,for sure.TanksRana"
4,Great Stories - First Rate and Old-Fashioned,"If you're looking for a dose of the Old West's mythology before it got re-written to include second thoughts and anti-heroes, this is a great collection of stories. No, they aren't particularly realistic. The good guys are really good, the bad guys are pure evil, and the guy in the white hat almost always draws faster than the guy in the black hat.In other words, when he wrote these magazine pieces, L'Amour was writing within the confines of a well-established genre, and you'll find nothing here to make you think particularly deep thoughts. However, these stories are just great. Well structured, well written, suspenseful, and full of vivid action and great characters. These stories were written to entertain, and that they still do!"
2,"No support, FTP issues, slow","I was a real Linksys fan until I tried this guy. Now, I find myself with a router that does NOT work properly when passing FTP client traffic to the net and (when it is not rebooting) runs VERY slowly. I am in the market for another brand if anybody has any suggestions."
2,No hidden beach here...,"only 2 or 3 cuts on this baby are good, Just look at the cover of the CD, and it tells you ""We gotta get this out quick""Take your time next time Kim & Company!"
4,Sweet movie,"Sweet. My wife loved it. Leslie Caron was great, and the dancing was fabulous.Also the supporting actors were good. Fred"
1,Enough to send you to Divorce Court,"This is the lousiest collection of 'wedding' music ever recorded-and it's not by ANY original artists. If you plan to use this as part of your wedding music, get ready for Divorce Court."
1,Don't bother,Don't bother puchasing this to save money. Go out and buy CDs from the TRUE artists. This cd butchers every great love song--and even the not so great ones. You'll do better finding another cd.
5,Convenient and practical,"Inexpensive and compact, this item allows you to turn your xD Picture card into a USB memory stick. With memory media cards being so expensive for any decent amount of memory, this allows you to get more use out of your camera's memory card. I bought a 1 GB card at the same time and now I can take a whole bunch of pictures, slip the memory card into the MAUSB-300 and either download the pictures directly into my computer without using the camera's cable (which is a pain to carry around and can wear out quickly if it gets to many kinks in it) or I can transfer files of other kinds onto the card and use it as a memory stick. A good investment for about $15."
2,over-rated puff piece,"I was dissappointed to find Mr. Conley's book to be a self-promoting manifesto rather that the hard-hitting tips as promised. The style and cadence of the book is pleasing, but it lacks the substance found in ""real"" business books. I am particulary dissappointed as I work in the same industry as Mr. Conley, I know people in his company, and I know he does not always practice what his book preaches. In fact, one review on this website is by the wife of an employee of Mr. Conley's. Not very objective I would say. The exercises in Conley's book are thought provoking, but I couldn't not get beyond the ego and self-promotion that is pervasive in this book."
1,Would not recommend!!!,"I was very disappointed with this product. After receiving the mixer and putting in batteries, the mixer would not turn on. I tried several different types of brand new batteries and it still would not turn on. The mixer appears to have some kind of a wiring issue. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone!!!"
1,Did not work!,"The mixer did not work when we inserted new batteries, correctly. The batteries tested fine. Amazon has refunded us the price of the mixer. Thank you Amazon!"
1,Don't buy,Got this for my Granddaughter as a Christmas gift---worked for about 3 minutes and quit. I wish I would have read the other reviews before I bought this.
4,"nice case, a tad deep","The case is nice and sturdy, with enough strong clasps to keep it securely closed. It was a tad deep, though, for my open-back banjo, so I had to add some padding to get the fit right and keep the banjo from getting jostled about."
1,Low on solved problems,"Did not contain enough exhaustive solutions to really help those who need to get over the ""math hump"". The text runs together and subject areas are not clearly seperated. It's like an abridged textbook. I expected more math help and less theory help. If your looking for a suplement to QM classes as an undergrad the Dover books are better at doing the math. The Schaum editors left their forte behind with this one.Update 11/03 - Half-way through second quarter in undergrad QM...still no help from this text. It attempts to be another textbook when it should double the solved problems both basic and complex. Problems should be solved from several angles and at various levels of approach.Update 12/06 - Finished my first qm grad class...still no gold stars."
5,Great Book,"If you are new to Quantum Mechanics and are clueless how to solve problems, this book is your guy. The book is flooded with worked out problems and has plenty exercises that will keep you busy for hours.This book is a great aid.Goodluck."
4,Good for Reviewing,"Don't buy this book expecting to learn quantum mechanics from it. This book is a good aid for someone who's studied the material and wants something to jog their memory. The examples are excellent, versatile, and solved in great detail. Buy this to supplement a more detailed book like Shankar's Principles of Quantum Mechanics or Griffith's Introduction to Quantum Mechanics."
2,Too Advanced,"I have taken an introductory course in quantum and am now studying intermediate quantum. This book has been of no help. This book is way too advanced and should be entitled, ""Schaum's Outline of Quantum Mechanics for Post-Doctorates of Physics."""
2,repetitive,"Like other people have said, this book is pretty short. To make matters worse, it repeats itself a lot and wastes a lot of pages with boring code such as using 3 pages to show a POJO (plain old java object) with nothing but getters and setters. Did they really need to show that? This book is an ok introduction to hibernate, but definately isn't worth the price. A lot of the same information can be found online, and this book doesn't really present the information in a new or useful way."
2,What a Disappointment (Experts Voice???),"To be fair, I must comment that I read this book after finishing ""Hibernate In Action"" which is, by far, the finest Hibernate book available.That being said, I can't remember the last time I was this disappointed with an addition to my library. Little more than a regurgitation of Hibernate's own online documentation this book falls well short of an ""Expert's Voice"" on the subject material."
4,"Lots of good information, no fluff","I found this book fills in a lot of the gaps left by Hibernate's online docs, but didn't dwell on the simple, basic stuff. It's been particularly useful in the area of defining relationships involving collections--one of the trickiest parts of setting up a mapping."
2,For those who don't like to use the mind...,"I looked at this at a friend's house and don't see any reason for it, unless you're brain dead! I speak with my ""future"" wife all of the time about our ""future"" sex life and we come up with some ideas from exiting to romantic to just strange, but we have agreed that we would try most of them. I suggest you brainstorm with your partner before hand when you are not ""turned on"". We are both VERY intimate in all areas of a relationship and I recomend not marrying until you come to that point. But if it's too late for that, you have no imagination, or you just want to see what she about sex... You could get this book, but wouldn't it be more interesting, not to mention easier if you look on the internet for ideas?"
4,OH BABY!,"My boyfriend & I already have a great sex life, but this book has provided us with great ways to add a little to things we've already been doing. It also has given us the courage to do some stuff that we ordinarily wouldn't! I think its a great resource for lovers! Even the most experimental couples can benefit from this book! The only drawback is that many of the situations presented assume that you can drop any other obligations in your life. While I understand that you must make time for your partner, it is often difficult to set aside the amount of time required for the situations in the book! However, we have not been disappointed yet!"
4,Very happy with this tool,"I've purchased this tool in January 2008 and used it side-by-side with a similar Ryobi impact cordless driver (borrowed from my contractor working in my house) that retails $20 to $30 more, plus battery. My impression is that it has even more power than the Ryobi but it is definitively heavier with its bulky battery. Fortunately the battery in the Denali can be rotated and this is a very convenient feature, albeit you can't get the white LED to shine on your screw if you turn the battery around. I'm not a contractor, so I don't use this every day but it seems like it's a good value for the money for personal usage."
5,Nice,"Protects me from the messier aspects of cooking and baking, has nice pockets that I use often, and even looks cute on."
5,Truly Interesting !!!,I love this book because this is a MAN that truly rose to the occasion !!!!! I truly believe this is a MAN that should be taught in our classrooms outside of Martin Luther King Jr. because he accomplished so much more to me.
5,good,"This item came in good timing, and was in good shape and happy with the senders did a great job."
1,not yet received,"i cannot review this item since i still have not gotten my first issue, i was about to call you and inquire as to why"
1,hand held texas hold'em and casino game,"It was not what I thought I wsa ordering.I was looking for a game that you hold in your hand and play with your fingers,so I was very disappointed,the one I have stopped working(I've played games like this for years}and I really miss it,But it was nobodies falt I just didn't understand what kind of game I was ordering.I didn't know that I would have to download it in order to play.so I can't say that the game was not good,it just wasn't what I thought it was."
3,"Well built frame, but customer service needs work","We received our canopy. Went to set it up the first time, only to find it was poorly packed and one of the connectors was placed sharp edge down against the top and it punctured the canopy top bundle leaving a dozen or so small holes in the top. Luckily it didn't rain for that three day show we were at. When we got back, we contacted shelterlogic. They were less than helpful even after sending them photos that we took on my phone. It was only after numerous calls, an extensive debate and letting them know that we were prepared to file claims with the state attorney general and small claims court that they agreed to send a replacement top. The new top was fine and the problem was resolved. However, it shouldn't have taken such a battle to get the manufacturer to fix what was essentially a packing error by a factory worker.Canopy quality is good, just expect to work for it if you need customer service."
4,"A slim, well-indexed guide that's great for quick answers","Our family has been living with parakeets for about four years now and we refer to this book on at least a weekly basis for answers to various questions about diet, socialization and behavior. It's very well-indexed --(E.g., Should your budgie have broccoli? Just look under ""vegetables"") -- which makes using the slim volume easy and productive. It isn't very detailed or tremendously scientific, but for the average parakeet owner/lover, it's a good little book to keep under your cage next to your millet spray!"
1,"Lots of problems, no solutions","I don't know about you, but I buy Schaum books so I can have a large number of problems to work with answers so I know when I'm doing it right. My great frustration is people who say ""don't look at the answers or you'll never learn the material"". BS. That's fine for people with good highschool math preparation, but when you're striving to overcome the legacy of miserable math teachers in US public schools, it fails miserably. I can spend hours on a problem and still not get it. I think the problem for people like me is that we just don't know the language or know how to think about mathematics. Hence I'm giving the book 1 star. I'm looking for a supplement to an obtuse text for an advance calculus course, not another obtuse text."
3,A Nuanced Thriller,"I was quite surprised that I was the first to review this title considering the favorable reviews it received in the mainstream press. (At least Ms. Wadham will have one review to read when she checks Amazon!) First, I enjoyed the book, although having grown up near Corsica, where this novel is set, adds a star to my review. The charcters are well drawn out, and the action well paced and realistic. The book is a subtle page turner that you will want to read in one sitting as it races to its conclusion. It details every parent's horror -- a child kidnapped by criminals -- in this case extremists. There is an earnest police detective and the usual assortment of village characters he deals with to solve the crime. But this isn't a detective novel. There are times when it's difficult to tell who in the book is ""good or bad"", but it doesn't detract from the tale. I was interested in the story because of the foreign locale and I wasn't disappointed."
4,"Tough subject, gripping story","Bill Sweet manages to give you a feel for the idealistic and tragic story of the Klingbiels, two Christian Science believers who decided to attempt rigorous field tests of prayer. Sweet's love for the protagonists allows him to treat their foibles, moments of inspiration, and occasional discouragement with a gentle hand.The story is well presented but not an ""easy read""; the topic is so personal and the story so engaging you'll want to digest it slowly. Buy the book and take a few days to consider ot carefully."
1,Deluxe Mini Play Cube by Anatex,"Very disappointing product. It arrived broken due to poor packaging for shipment. Fortunately, Amazon only offered refunds (no replacements) on the return and we did get our money refunded. The toy was constructed out of low quality plywood. The portion broken during shipping was located on the face containing the ""peg maze"". If this face breaks during play, the pegs will become a choke hazard. For the cost, I would have expected something more solidly constructed. Not recommended."
1,Dangerous,"My wife purchased this and it appeared to be a nice toy at first but the edges in some areas of this toy are sharp. And although the main corners are somewhat smoothed out, there are corners where the jigsawed top connect that are pointed and SHARP!My child lightly bumped the edge (not the jigsaw point) and it sliced right through his skin. It left a 1 inch gash on his nose. Thankfully it wasn't the jigsaw point. Will be returning it."
5,bought for 3 granddaughters,"I bought this for my 3 grandaughters, ages 3, 11 months and 10 months in age. They all love it. The littlest ones can stand by it as they are just barely starting to stand and walk. They love the bead rollercoaster the best. Both the babies play at the same time. The 3 year old loves it too. Even I like playing with them, racing the beads around for the little ones to chase. I was worried about it breaking in shipment as a lot of reviews said that happened, but it came perfect. The gears are perfect, no problems as others stated. Everything about this is A+. sturdy, fun and educational. great for when they come to grandmas!!"
1,No Effect,"I read about this product and it sounded good, so I decided to give it a try. I took it for a month and did not notice a single thing, good or bad. Some people had noted increased stamina and energy while on it, but I did not get any benefit whatsoever. I may have kept taking it anyway, but it really smells and tastes nasty; it was a chore to swallow every day. I may try another brand, but this one was a huge disappointment. I do take other things made by this manufacturer, and they seem to be of good quality."
1,mouse magic don't buy!,"I bought 2 boxes of Mouse Magic about a month ago. Please save your money; it does not work. I still have mice, one of whom I saw run over the packet of Mouse Magic that I had put out. You could almost hear him laugh! I tried to give in a zero star review, but I had to enter something for the review to go through."
1,a real bummer,I purchased this toy for last Christmas (2004). I was surprised it is still for sale. This toy did not work from day one. Don't waste your money.
1,More bad news,"I too was duped by the Little Tikes name into thinking that this toy would be durable. But from now on I will only trust Little Tikes stuff that's non-electronic. I think the design of the plastic casing is good, but the wiring is faulty. On our set, not only was there zero reception, but the ""morse code"" beeping button did not work on one of them. I wanted to add my review so that the number of one-stars on this product continues to increase."
1,JUNK,SAVE YOUR MONEY. YOUR ARE BETTER OFF WITH 2 DIXIE CUPS AND A PIECE OF STRING. THEY NEVER WORKED.I CANT BELIEVE THEY ARE STILL SELLING THIS THING.
1,A total WASTE of money,"I purchased this as Christmas gift for my 2 yr old son & his Daddy to play.... Not only could we not get 'good' reception, we couldn't get ANY reception! Not in the same house, not in the same room. I returned it to Toys R Us who promplty refunded my money. Don't waste your $."
5,Just as expected,We had one but it was 20 years old and the back cracked. We were still using it but the bristles were shortened but again still worked better than anything we have at home.
2,Smashed after three weeks.,"I read all the reviews about this brush, and I thought it would be the greatest thing ever. It was not. If you like having your scalp destroyed by bristles that don't have any little balls on the end, then this is the brush for you. I foolishly believed the hype about the anti-static properties of this brush as I ignored the fact that rubbing two insulators together creates static elecricity unless one is connected to a grounding strap. All joking aside, this brush is not worth $22, and I would not recommend it."
3,not loud but works well and looks good,not any louder than stock but works well no other complaints. If you are looking for a louder horn carry on looking
3,Hard N Fast - Just the Way I Like It,"Don't care for all the satanic references and images but the guitars are heavy, the drums blistering, and the vocals surprisingly strong, especially for a band in this genre. Definitely recommend for fans of early Iron Maiden, Hammerfall, Helloween, Iron Savior, Warrior, etc."
3,Sudden price change,"When I was in the process of selecting this product, I had a choice of one book at 32$ US and one at 40$US, I selected the 32$ one but was forced to go for the more expensive one, I never understood why you people did this. This left me with questioning the credibility of your firm.Since I belong to a ship modeling club and we all purchase books from your organization, this experience was brought forward by myself as a subject of discussion. None of the members had an answer as to what had happened and suggested that I communicate my experience to you."
5,Perfect for wireless viewing listening to TV,"Sure there's background noise. Just adjust the volumes to tune it out. I never tried the headphones, I just wanted it for the wireless jack to plug my earbuds to. This is much better than my previous TV Listener because I can use any headphones with it. As my dog and my bird chew them up I just plug in a new one. Perfect!"
3,just ok,It's an ok product. The ear pieces are bigger than I'd like. I guess I've gotten used to small ear buds and so these are a bit bulky and uncomfortable. And you have to stay in just the right position...no moving around or you get static. So it kind of sucks to feel trapped just to listen to the radio. I could more easily use radio.com on my iPhone and listen to it with the ear buds. But I was hoping to be able to use these with my radio or tv and save my iPhone's battery.
5,Reverence for Growth of the Human Spirit,"This incredible collection of poems reflects Dr. Rice's profound appreciation of the depth and breadth of the human condition. His poetry reflects his unflinching attention on the enormous joys and terrible struggles facing all of us on the journey towards wholeness.Tackling subjects as varied as Suffering (""Suffer the Suffering"") to Love (""Chunky Love"") his poems are sometimes passionate, sometimes funny, and always poignant.This book is truly a gem-- a collection of deep and meaningful poetry to be read aloud with friends and loved ones again and again.-Dolph Arniar"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"There's not enough words to describe how bad a purchase this was. It fried my PDA, a TungstenE3. I left it in the cradle to charge while I ran a few errands. Returned home after about two hours and my PDA was dead. Unfortunately I'd had it about two months and there was no warranty remaining, so I was out the money for this useless thing, plus the cost of a new PDA. Save your money..This is a piece of junk."
3,Definitely Needs Some Improvements,"I purchased this cradle for my Palm TX. The one thing that really annoys me is the fact that there is an internal light that is always on. I keep it near my monitor, so it can be pretty distracting. It also takes a fair amount of effort to connect your PDA to it. Not only do you need to manually line up the connection points, you have to use a good amount of force to connect and disconnect your PDA from it."
3,Looks nice but not as functional as my old Clie Cradle,"Perhaps I was spoiled.Based on my experience with my old Sony Clie, I expected to be able to seat and unseat my PDA with one hand. However, I find myself trying to align the unit with the connector each time I set it in the cradle. The instruction to ""lift straight up"" does not seem to be doing the trick for me in removing the unit. I end up using two hands and still some what struggling. I am concerned I will damage it. Perhaps after I try out the cables, I will have a greater appreciation for the cradle.I find the always on light to be sort of odd. However, it is handy when I want to step into my office and set the PDA on the unit without turning on the lights. The thing is like a beacon! (Which is a good thing...one needs plenty of light to use this cradle.)"
4,Palm Cradle Kit,"Product works as described. The connection to the power, due to the size of the transformer, takes up a lot of physical space where the plug gets inserted into the outlet so a smaller size, if possible, would be more practical. Very useful to have a cradle to minimize plugging the adapter in and out to transport which can lead to bent connections."
2,Prepare to spend hours with Palm technical support,"I had a problem right from the start. Any time the handheld was powered up by or on the cradle, it would freeze. I had to perform a soft reset to get things going again. I called Palm and they said it was a defective cradle. I sent the cradle back to PC Universe (on my dime - they won't pay for returns, even when they conclude that the item was defective). The new cradle, however, had the same problem. Neither Palm tech support nor the retailer knew about a patch needed to get this cradle to work with my Palm TX. I found it myself on Palm's website and then asked them about it (on the third call). I spent hours trying to get the issue resolved, and ironically it was finally solved by deleting the patch I had just installed. I have had this problem with Palm cradles before (then it was a Handspring Visor, but the same problem)."
3,Handy but not smoothe,"I like the cradle kit because it kills two birds with one stone. You can charge and sync at the same time, and you don't have to mess around with wires. That being said though, I find it slightly more difficult to get my palm in the holes just right to perform the operation than it was to simply plug the usb and power cables into the device. It's also slightly annoying that the light stays on all the time."
4,"Yes, this should have been on the actual DVD, BUT...","It is a very nice watch. I think that if you're a true fan of the movies (at least the first one, which is kind of the only one worth watching, really) then you should be willing to buy this DVD. It's really long and although they don't go into the newer, horrible Return of the Living Dead movies (who cares!), they still get really in depth about the ones that matter to everyone. Anyway, you get to see what everyone looks like now-a-days. THAT'S A HUGE PLUS."
4,Good documentary for the true fans,"If you are a fan of this movie you will like this. All of the original actors participated, lots of behind the seen storys, everything that makes a good documentary."
4,Delicious,"The Jack Daniel's Barbeque Sauce - Hickory Brown Sugar is awesome. I just wish it was offered as a Subscribe and Save Item. It was a little costly this way. This flavor isn't offered at any of the stores I shop, Meijer or Kroger. But the other flavors are priced under $4.00."
2,This book is so so at best,"I love the show What Not To Wear. I thought that with the experience Stacey London had working at Vogue, the book would be well written and helpful. Not so much. It's a good book for people who know nothing about fashion--much like the unfortunately dressed people they ambush. Each body type gets a few pages dedicated to casual wear, work wear, evening wear, etc. I donated my copy to the library."
3,Wanted just a little more ...,"Just the fact that there are so many pictures makes this book useful. But, if you watch the show regularly, not much is new.Here's what I missed:1) really, really curvy people, both men and women (OK, fatter people). Once you get past size 18, it's a whole new ball game.2) sources. Some of us do not live in or close to large metropolitan shopping areas. Where can we buy, see, find out about some of the designers used in the book.There is a list in the back of the brands of clothing, accessories, and shoes for each model, but no information about how to locate any of it.The 'Universal Tips' for all body types were useful as were pictures of different ways to combine colors and textures.Next book, I'd like just a bit more."
1,Not enough help,I was hoping to see many smaller photos of clothing for my body type but there are only about 3 per figure. The rest of the book is a waste because it for different types of figures.
4,"dress your best , please make a new book","I have your book and you had the list of what to but for women,menbut , now we need a book to tell us what to wear under are colthes.and what tops to wear with pants,shrit,shorts. in all sizes. what colors match on diff. sizes???? other then that I really love the book!!!!!!! but I still need to know what gos with with and the right colors to fit the right body. I which the show every night and fridays night to. Please make a new book with the list of colthes and colors and right body. this book has great piture, and other sizes for girls and men they did a good job just needed more colthes on each of the body sizes. I would buy this book again."
5,My daughter loves this book to death!,My 3 year old daughter loves this book so much we've actually bought a second and third book to keep in varying places because she takes it everywhere and needs to find it at a moments notice! She sings the song constantly and this book has peaked her interest in other sing-a-long books. Highly recommended!
5,great musical classic,"I first discovered this book in a Music Together class, and wow, do toddlers love it. It is a simple, catchy song with colorful, classic pictures...an instant hit! Lyrical and rhythmic, this book is a great addition to any toddler's library. It is important for toddlers to hear rhyming language and music as they learn to speak, and this book would be a great way to serve that purpose, plus it's simply lots of fun."
1,A major disappointment,"I can only agree with the previous review posted by mnyby: this DVD is a major disappointment. Not only short on Byrds material, but poorly presented with distracting features. Anyone who buys this is likely to know who the Byrds are, so we don't need the intrusive captions. This is NOT the original Byrds, by the way, the reviewer who said it is doesn't know what he's talking about. This is the ""Skip Battin era"" Byrds when Roger McGuinn was the only original member. Hopefully one day Byrds fans will get something better than this on DVD."
3,"Too awful not to watch. The Byrds, nevertheless.","True confessions: I am a life-long Roger McGuinn fan. I also greatly admire the late Clarence White. I agree with all the reviewers here that this 4-song ""EP"" is practically a ""how not to"" lesson on producing a successful music DVD. Adding insult to injury I am pretty sure that Roger was seriously hung-over when this thing was recorded. He doesn't look good.However, I believe it is still a ""must see"" for all true Byrd fans. Not sure if there's much recorded showing Clarence White in action, so that's one reason to own it. The other is having a pretty good live version of ""Chestnut Mare.""Yes, it's bad. But even bad Byrds is good."
2,Good in name only,"Seymour Duncan is known for making decent pick-ups for guitars, but this is not one of them. It may be hum-canceling, but it also extremely low, when it comes to output, and I experienced a lot of self-noise in the pick-up.I have used it two different ways, both with the intention of recording acoustic guitar:First I tried plugging it into a small tube-amplifier, which in turn was mic'ed up. There was no hum from the guitar, but the hiss of white noise made it completely useless. I ended up just putting the mic from the amp in front of the guitar instead.Second, I tried plugging the Seymour Duncan straight into my pre-amp/recording setup. Again the noise was unbearable, and I ended up setting up another mic and playing in front of that.In other words, I would not recommend this pick-up, if you intend to record acoustic guitar. It may be alright for live purposes, but be aware that its output is fairly low."
3,Disappointed,"I had a Dean Markley sound hole pickup, which produced a hum when I turned up the volume. I thought this pickup (Seymour Duncan Hum-Canceling pickup) would be ideal for my needs. It does eliminate the hum, but the Dean Markley had better tone and volume at a lower setting. I use it regularly, but am actively looking for an upgrade."
5,Love & the Mideast Conflict -- I love this combo in novels,"Edeet Ravel has done it again -- a wonderful novel that integrates the political nuances of the Middle East conflict with the personal complexity of real people who live in it. The first half of the book sets the stage, portraying real people and their lives, while the second half kept me at the edge of my seat, wondering how it will all work out: will she find him? will love prevail? or will romance collide with reality?I loved this book and eagerly await the third in the trilogy."
3,Inconsistent,"The first half of this book I thoroughly enjoyed - the writing, the setting, the descriptions of Israel and her relationships.Then...it just started getting more and more off track. Silly, not believable and in the end disappointing."
2,Fury without effect,"OK, this completes my reviews of the first three Landau-banded CDs. Abe Laborial is a great drummer (presently with McCartney, but in other contexts too). Landau is an estimable guitar player, whose style and sense of musical phrasing and structure has continued to develop in interesting ways. This power trio offering though is really just a latter-day attempt at Cream. Much, much better in this vein is Gov't Mule. There is not enough musical air here nor a palpable sense of the palyers listening to one another across the stage. That is what power trios are all about, when they are about anything. Moreover, the trio context, which should have allowed Landau 'outside' freedom with his playing, does not. The guitar solos are not really interesting no matters how much dexterity they show. Disappointing disc; Landau's own material these days dwarfs this outing."
1,Faulty connector,"The belt was ok but the connector didn't last two weeks, it broke off. Do yourself a favor and spend a few dollars more on a military issue product."
4,I bought as a gift,I have not opened or tried this series as I've bought as a gift. It did come to my address undamaged and quickly.
4,Somebody SAVE ME!,"It's all about the LEXual healing baby. Any 'Villehead knows these sets are all about revisiting the angst and fuzzy warm feelings we all get when it comes to Superman. Not to mention season 2 is THE season for classic high school woes for our super hero click; he loves Chloe, no wait, Lana, no wait, Chloe.....wait, he LOVES Pete his HOMEBOY!!!The Bloopers at the end of disc 6 are as clean cut as the show is just about, but nothing in the world beats Michael Rosenbaum tickling his own nipple through his shirt in the end!!"
4,Darker than season 1,"Season 2 was more full of angst than season 1. Clark begins to be held accountable for his actions. There are many tension filled scenes in which he rushes off to save someone only to return and realize that things aren't ok with Lana, or Chloe or Lex, or Mom or Dad. In fact the season finale was really upsetting and Clark leaves Smallville after his actions have a heartbreaking effect on his mom and dad.The acting was good, story line was good. I'm excited to see what they do with Season 3."
1,not enough extras,"episodes aside this dvd set sucks. there is almost nothing on here extra. the fx of smallville, gag reels, and deleted scenes. thats it. 2 commentarys! thats it. buffys dvds have like 11 commentarys per season. really they could do better."
4,Sweet/Hilarious love story,The look of love had me glued to my kindle for 12 hrs !!!!!The story line has great characters who were genuine ...The old crook will make you laugh Carmel will have you thinking and Dr.McHottie will have you go to the ER in search.... In all this book is a good read with the ups and downs of new love...
3,OK,"The look of love is a good book about a full figured woman. Carmel faces problems with the man she works for ex wife always calling her insulting names about her wife, but she puts her in her place. I felt there could have been more romance between Carmel and Steve, they seemed to move so fast, but overall it was pretty good"
3,My first Rabbi Small mystery.,"I realize that this is not the first book in this series, but it is his first that I have read. Although it wasn't great, I'm not quite yet ready to write off the author completely. This particular book seems to be really low-key as far as creating a motive and building storylines. However, I thought it was an okay book if you want an easy, non-suspenseful read. I'll probably try and find the first in this series and start there and see how it goes."
1,This is an 8 ounce hammer!,"This is an 8 ounce hammer not a 24 ounce hammer. It is a fine hammer, but NOT a 24 ounce hammer. I am only repeating this to meet the word limit."
2,well...,"This album is really just dissapointing. There are a few moments when the Orchestra does come across the way that it should, but I can count those on one hand. The major problem with the Orchestral redition here is that it just doesn't flow the way it should. It's very choppy and sounds more like a middle school band then a Royal Philharmonic. You would think that, after playing the work of classical geniuses for all these years, some of that would come across in the reinterpretation of REM. But this simply does not happen. The part that bugged me most about the the whole thing is how Stipe's voice is often done by a solo tuba or something obscure like that and it sounds very hokey.To sum this album up, it's REM's best put to elevator music."
3,You can swing in your yard and not worry about breaking any windows,What I like most is how you develope a feel for the ball hitting these so when you hit a real ball you sence the connetion.
1,there are better low carb cookbooks,"Found the recipes nasty, its a very small book, and the cutesy commentary is annoying. Try the low carb cookbooks by Donna Rodnitzky or Fran McCullough instead."
3,"Great Product, Battery Sucks","I purchased four of these switches. Of the four, the battery in two almost immediately failed. When the electricity goes out, they loose their programming. Otherwise, this is a great product."
4,"very well done, in a fantastical realality way.","Mercedes Lackey and larry Dixon have done a wonderful job of outlining some of the dangers that face kids nowadays and what gets them into the situations that they will end up in when they try to leave home to fend for themselves too early, but feel that their homelife is too much to take anymore. The way they are saved is nice to think of but we all know that it woudn't happen. The main characters are easy to identify with for all ages and are well formed, rounded. All in all a romp through modern times with a skew on some truths all for the better."
1,DON'T BUY,"IF YOU THINK YOR'RE GETTING A MOODY BLUES DVD, FORGET IT. THREE SONGS BY THE VERY EARLY GROUP ARE ON THIS AND THEN IT GOES TO POP-UP VIDEOS, AND OTHER GROUPS NOT EVEN MENTIONED IN THE ORIGINAL ADD. I'M RETURNING MIME TO AMAZON FOR A FULL REFUND. THATS WHAT I GET FOR DEALING WITH A UNKNOWN FOREIGN SOURCE. VERY DISAPOINTED."
2,Overrated,"Let me start off by saying that there are many aspects of this album that I like. The Cold and Dark feeling as well as the raw power of the sound. The music is extremely simple and straightforward. The problem is that the music is sooo repetitive and monotonous that after two tracks and a couple listens, it becomes very boring! It is recorded very poorly on purpose and that doesn't make it any better or make it (what some people who have no idea what they are talking about) True Black Metal. It just plain sounds Bad. There is far better early Black Metal albums and bands. Check out early Immortal, Abigor, Enslaved, Mayhem, Emperor, and even Darkthrone's own, A Blaze in the Northern Sky, to just name a few."
1,Forget B movie It's a D movie,"Sigh. I think me and my group of friends could have done a better job at acting then this. It seemed like some of the actors (and I use that term loosely) weren't at all interested in being in this film. They were as they say in basketball ""going through the motion""Natalie Laspina is beautiful, but this ilm was ugly. The killer was lame, the special effects are what you would expect from a lower than low budget film. The random dancing at the carwash with the guys was embarrassing and utterly pointless. I found myself throughout the movie saying ""Instead of this, I would have done this.."" Basically changing the movie and when I become the writer and editor as a viewer thats when a movie is bad.I ask myself why would anyone want to be in a film like this? Maybe it looks better on paper, but the acting, special effects just ruined it, with time and some....ok alot of alterations this film could have been a decent B movie."
4,Almost Amazing,"Easy to use. No metallic hiss you'd normally expect. The only real drawback is the lack of presence when it comes to the bassier strings. It takes some skill to EQ things to the point of normalcy. If you're uncomfortable dealing with EQ, this might not be your best bet. Otherwise, a wonderful product at a great price."
4,Good Sound - Great Price,"I bought this acoustic guitar pickup based on the reviews I read. For the price, it produces a great sound. I have no regret spending the 20-30 dollars to purchase this little guy. I recommend Taking the time to adjust the settings on your acoustic amp when using this pickup. A little tweak here, a little there and you will produce a warm acoustic sound. For my guitar, I tend to decrease the bass and pump up the treble."
1,lumpy lotion and broken tube,"After researching sunscreens to find safe ones for my children, I was excited to try this one. However, when we squeezed some out, it was lumpy and did not apply evenly or smoothly. That was the first time we used it. The second time, it would not come out because the tube had burst at the seam at the TOP. The only way to get it out now is to close the lid and squeeze it out the hole in the top. I am VERY disappointed. What a WASTE of $$$. This company should be ashamed to have sold such a crummy product."
5,Tom's new toy,Whith this addaptor I am getting a lots more uses of my iPod. This is what I needed.Tom
3,It works with a little wiggle.,It feels cheap and it needs to be wiggled into just the right spot before it works. However it did cost all of 3$ and to be honest I'm actually okay with the quality.
1,Beware!! the new gen ipod classic does not work with this cable!!,I ordered this hoping to test my brand new ipod classic on TV. Once it arrived...(expedited shipping and all) I found out it wasn't working. YES I did set the TV out fx. I found the reason on the web... The new generation Ipod has a chip that prevents 3rd party cable from outputing to TV. You have to buy the 50 dollar cable from IPOD to do this... I think I'm going to buy 200 blank DVD's for the price and watch on DVD player... and I prob. won't buy IPOD again... should have gone with other company. Is it me or APPLE is more like Microsoft now?
3,Mediocre Quality but Works,"There undoubtedly better cables that will provide a better picture. If I hold my iPod while it's playing video through this cable the picture is distorted. When I place the iPod down the picture is relatively clear. But, it's cheap and work well for travel."
3,Just ok,Did not work perfectly....I had to pull the cable out a tini bit to get the video to work. Worth the price.
3,"Macally Audio and Video Cable for iPod classic 4G, 5G, 5.5G (White)","works ok for older ipod models - was disappointed a little in compatibility - but for the price, well worth the try"
2,works but color bad,The cable works but the color and tint are all off when I connect my ipod to my tv. I have not yet tried to change the settings on the t.v. but it will be a pain if I have to do that every time I want to watch something.
2,"Item is OK, but is not compatible with my equipment","Item is OK, but not compatible with the iPod Classic 160 GB which I wanted to use it with. Kind of disappointing."
1,dynex LCD doesn't recognise any siganal,"I was so happy to get this, finally, I could go directly to the tv from the ipod instead getting mediocre playback from my rca surround sound ipod dock,that doesn't recognise video playlists, but alas, that was not the case. No signal on my tv from my ipod classic 160 gb, just as sucky as the other thing I bought to go directly to tv. Are there any reliable cables that DON'T SUCK and ACTUALLY WORK?"
5,Macally Audio Cable,Just what the doctor ordered! Can now use my IPod with the receiver from my stereo system and my flat screen!
1,Useless,"This cable is useless. Though it does seem to be made well, the functionality is equal to that of a pet rock. It does nothing. I plugged it in snugly into my ipod, plugged the other end into my projecter, and ENABLED TV OUT, and it simply said ""tv out is turned on. please connect video accessory"" WHEN IT WAS INDEED PLUGGED IN. I would reccommend this product only to people who require a useless string-like object. This product, simply put, DOES NOTHING."
1,Zero out of six cables worked!!!,"Be warned, you get what you pay for. I ordered three of these cables to use with an iPod video 5g. None of them had proper functioning video and two of them had no right audio. The seller sent me three replacements which all had poor functioning video also. I know that it was a problem with the cables because I have another cable that works properly. After this experience I ordered two NXG cablesNxg Audio Video Cable for Ipodthat worked great. I would highly suggest spending the extra money on those and not wasting your time with these cheap cables.Nxg Audio Video Cable for Ipod"
2,Not a good source.,"Vaguely written, without focus, this book is of no use to any b-school applicant who has any common sense and has bothered to familiarize him/herself with the application process. For example, the author states ""a weak personal statement is almost sure to compromise an applicant's chance for success."" Is this not obvious to any reasonable adult? This book may be useful to someone who has no idea what is entailed in applying to business school, but a quick look at several b-school applications will tell you everything this book has to say. I recommend you spend your time and money on another source. I found ""Marketing Yourself to the Top Business Schools,"" by Phil and Carol Carpenter much more insightful and helpful."
1,I was really disappointed very cheap scrap leather and plastic/vinyl,"Very cheap should give it away,,, go to jaffrums,,, don't waste your money on this,, I'm,surprised amazon carries,junk like this"
1,i only got 4 of 7 pieces,I was really disappointed with this product. I ordered it be here just before a trip I did get it in time however I only got 4 of the 7 pieces not even both saddlebags only 1.lame
2,Won't fit the regular Joe's arm,"I'm 5'9"" and 150 lbs, and this product just won't fit tightly in my arm. I have the 60 GB iPod and even without exercise, it starts slipping down in about two minutes.If you have a 60GB iPod, I'm not sure there are other options. Anyway, I am returning this product."
4,Good Buy,"I am a 215 lb man with largish arms and it fits me perfectly. Anyone with small arms may want another product. I love this one. Once I punched a new hole in the top to accommodate my 5th gen. ipod's headphone jack it was a great fit. I can even jam my ipod in there without removing my hard plastic protective case. Keeps the ipod clean, dry, safe, and doesn't slip. What more could you want?"
4,A good product,Product does exactly what it says-Keeps the iPod out of the way while you work or exercise. Convenient holder for wires.
5,A tender treasure of a book!,"I had the pleasure of reviewing this book for a quote and must say that it was truly a delight from start to finish! I fell in love with James and Elizabeth and with the precious ""treasures"" entrusted to their care. Rebecca Hagan Lee has a lyrical writing style and a heartwarming voice. I can't wait for her next book!"
5,Oh how dead doom metal is.....,"Amorphis went pop. Paradise Lost got lost. Katatonia and Anathema have taken Prozac. And now My Dying Bride went melodeath. The only bands left now are Candlemass, Cathedral, and Draconian. But this isnt about those aforementioned bands, this is about My Dying Bride's epic classic Turn Loose the Swans.First off, let people know that there is not one fast song on this album. This album is slow, almost death-like slow. It feels like the guitarists are rubbing sandpaper on your face while the violin, keyboards, and drums lull you into a deep trance, which is quickly ended as soon as the singer unleashes his vicious snarl.This album is seen as a landmark in the devolopment of doom-death, and I cant disagree more.If you enjoyed this also try Paradise Lost's Gothic and my new favorite album Celtic Frost's Monotheist."
4,every night,"listen to it every night when the lights are out for about three months now.changes everything into alright now. different from the live, but there's a reason it's out of stock."
3,Schaum's Surveying,"A useful text for beginning surveying students. It does not, unfortunately cover modern equipment or methods."
2,dissapointed,expected more. their made cheaply and are tight on my wrists( and im an average female). Definitely wont work for an average mans wrists.
1,Best Intentions,"While I believe the seller had the best intentions, these cuffs are no better than the 99 store cuffs that children play cops and robbers with. They broke within the first few days of use. They were made of flimsy plastic and the red fur material was falling apart from the moment I received them in the mail. Don't spend your money this these junk cuffs."
2,Ha,"Well I'm not mad or disappointed no one lied on these reviews these handcuffs really are a waste of time and money lol. When I got it the product package was already opened , and the fabric was ripped bafly, the metal broke instantly.the key is also stuck in handcuffs now as I speak. Like I said I'm not shocked just letting you know they wouldn't be any good for real use maybe as a prank or for looks like to hang if your car I don't know but I do know they are poorly made."
4,cat chews,"My kitten( 11 months) who likes to chew on everything loves these treats. They are sort of like kitty raw hides. She knows where I keep them and goes to look for them. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is I wish they lasted longer, she can chew and eat one in just a couple of minutes."
1,Two Paws Down,"My cat is the most food oriented animal I have ever had. He was a scavenger before we adopted him; eating out of dumpsters and who knows what else. It took us months and many rolls of duct tape to train him to stay out of our kitchen trash. He will eat anything except for salsa, peanut butter, chocolate, and food with too much cinnamon. Notice that jalapeno potato chips, bread of any type (through the plastic bag), carrots, and bird seed were not mentioned in the list of food he won't eat? Well add these cat chew treats to list of things he won't eat. He won't even touch them. He shows absolutely no interest in these once he sniffs them. They may help with tartar, but only if the cat eats them. Will not purchase again."
3,Core?,"I find that the best time to use this is an evening workout. Good to relax my legs. But I wouldn't want anyone to purchase it as a core workout. While your core is an integral part of just about any workout, I probably wouldn't have bought this one if I knew that it wasn't ""core centric""."
4,"Different, but okay","I like most of the Shiva Rea DVD's I've tried. This one is a bit different from the rest, but short and perfect for when you only have a few minutes to do yoga.I enjoyed it. It wasn't too hard, but challenging enough that I'll have to do it for a while to get the hang of some of the movements. The garden where it's filmed and Shiva are both absolutely beautiful, and it's enjoyable just to watch.I didn't like it as well as the first creative core, but still think it will be a valuable addition to my yoga DVD collection."
4,Well-written but assumes prior knowledge,"It is a very well-written history that tries to clear up a lot of misconceptions and misleading propaganda about the Teutonic Knights both from modern (Polish/Soviet) and contemporary (Polish/Lithuanian) sources. But, the author doesn't cover a lot of context or provide clear maps most of the time, so be prepared to consult for general histories, Wikipedia or an atlas regularly to figure out what and where he is talking about."
5,Amazing!!!,The Blu Ray combo pack was a great deal. The price was amazing and the show is hilarious!! I highly recommend it.
2,Chick alert,"This is one of the more cynical chick flicks, designed for Oprah lovers and readers of Soap Opera Daily. The three female leads do a fine job; it's not easy to be giggling 13-year-olds while middle aged. But the script is so pathetically weak, predictable, and tear-stained that so sensible person should find it attractive.That's the longest 93 minutes I've lived through in quite some time. And even the price of the DVD, $1.98, was way too high."
3,Good for a short class to get ready for a trip,This book is not for someone trying to teach themself Spanish from the beginning. Gives no grammar explanations. It is a good book to have a short class with an experienced teacher who can explain the grammar that goes along with it.
1,Avoid Like The Plague,"I wholeheartedly concur with the other reviews. I didn't have any problems loading the game but words cannot convey the huge sense of disappointment deliverd by this puerile, simplistic load of tosh. I too was seduced by the History Channel endorsement, they should be ashamed of themselves to be associated with such tripe.Awful, awful, awful."
5,The FIrst American Composer,What has happened to American music patriotism?Louis Moreau Gottschalk was probably the first American Pop Star ! In the 1850's women swooned. If it were permissal to hurl their nickers on stage they would have done do! The story goes that he was the musical Brad Pitt of the age.This is a music book for pianists! It contains a wealth of information about this pop star in the form of notes to the music as well as the music itself (for those who play the piano).Dover Publications are often more user friendly than some of the others. This publication contains anecdotes and copies of the original binder covers from some of the music books first published.For pianists this is a delightful and well presented edition of an important part of American history.There are a number of beautifully played CD's available. Get the book and read along with the CD. Now that is something you never thought of!
3,As Advertised,"Used this product in my new home. My contractor Brother, does drywall for a living, owns a older version and begged to buy this one after he used it."
1,Does NOT contain info for 6 cylinders,I have a 67 mustang that I want to swap over to a V8 (289-351) and wanted to know what needed to be changed. This book had no info for 6 cylinders. What ...[mad me mad] ...is that it doesn't say anywhere that it is for V8's only. If you have a 6 cylinder then don't buy this book....
4,Simple and Fun,I own a miriad of dance workout videos and rotate them frequently to prevent boredom. I bought this one as an Amazon instant vid and just finished the workout. The routines are simple so you don't have to pause the workout to learn them. Great fun! Worked up a light sweat. I highly recommend if you are new to dancing because the choreography is not overwhelming and you can start dancing right away. Puts a smile on your face!
1,Not good for beginners,"I lasted about 4 minutes into this video. There was little instruction, and the music was just awful. I think it would be better for someone who knows the moves."
2,Nice if you are in bad shape,"If you are looking to get moving, this is a nice work-out. If you are looking to get great exercise, look elsewhere."
2,Pass on this one,"Normally, I love Manfrotto's accessories. This item however just does not work well. Poor design is the issue. The little clips that hold the reflector are way too small. If you are using one of the 5-in-1 reflectors with the zippered outer portion on it, forget about this item. The clips just are not large enough to hold onto something that thick. The kind of sad part is that they need only be about 1/8"" wider and everything would be great. Someone let this slip past R and D without proper thought."
1,Disappointed,"I read one of the sample chapters online on Jabber, the peer-to-peer instant messaging service, and was thoroughly disappointed. By Chapter 6, I would have expected the hype to have waned away, and would like to see a technical description. But the chapter read like a marketing document, with sparse technical content."
4,good power adaptor,had to buy when power supply i got had too short of sata power connectors to reach hard drive and cdrom. was delivered fast and worked for what i needed.
5,I love this.,This product is super easy to use and all around it just works. Glad i ordered it. Shipping could be worked on but all around it is a great product.
3,"Interesting, but too long","This was my first exposure to Harry Turtledove, and overall it wasn't a bad one. Some of the characters are cliches, but I did enjoy his conjecture of Lincoln. However, this book, as all others of Mr. Turtledove's novels I have read, suffers from overkill--he could have left out at least a third of it without harming the story at all. Still, I'd recommend it, particularly to readers who enjoy lighter historical novels."
2,Please.,"""How Few Remain"" is going to be an accurate accounting of Harry Turtledove's fans if he doesn't wake up. Guns of the South was great fiction, so was the first WorldWar book. I agree with the reviewer who applauded them and compared them to the best in recent war fiction, brilliant novels like ""The Killer Angels"", ""The Triumph and the Glory"", and ""The 13th Valley"". It is very obvious that those authors are passionate about their books and aren't just cranking out half-baked manuscripts full of cliches and, like the earlier reviewer mentioned, laughable stereotypes. Turtledove has a lot of talent, and, more relevant to this discussion, a lot of talent left, because he hasn't used up much of it on this book."
1,How Few Remain,"After reading Guns of the South, this was a disappointing ramble. It drags along marginally holding interest. The scenarios presented made little sense. Hoping for a break out, I continued past the halfway mark and wished I'd never started. Sadly, I did complete the book but wouldn't have, had I not already been so far into it."
4,"A very worthy read, a real page-turner","I was disappointed to find that this was not Guns of the South II, but it turned out to be better, since it makes you consider what history would really be like if the South had won. Makes you sit around the extend Mr. Turtledove's reasoning to the present day. Very well written, and very compelling, my only complaints would be that a) he clearly loves to beat up on the North -- apparently he's a frustrated Southerner -- and b) some of his plot devices you see coming from a mile off."
3,A disappointing alternate history novel from Turtledove,"If you've ever had a dish that you normally find delicious, but this time just isn't quite right (and you can't put your finger on exactly what's wrong), then you already know what it will feel like to read How Few Remain. Every other one of Turtledove's novels I've ever read has cost me a good deal of sleep because I just couldn't put it down - I had no problem at all putting this one down and going to bed early. I think I just dislike the US being the bad guy in this novel, and constantly going from bad to worse (there's a sickening feeling that strikes at our national pride when we read about an impotent, incompetant, and powerless US). Sort of the same feeling you get watching Kane go from being a hero and good guy and gradually slide down to become a despicable and corrupted man in Citizen Kane. How Few Remain is a depressing book to read, and is certainly Turtledove's worst, but his worst IS better than a lot of people's best."
2,Alternative history novel has bad case of the bloats,"Harry Turtledove can write gripping alternative histories. Look at ""Guns of the South"" and the first volume of the ""Worldwar"" series for examples. ""How Few Remain"" has many sins, it is ponderous and cliche ridden but it's greatest sin is that it is boring. In the end I was left with the feeling that not only is the idea of editorial supervision dead and buried but, even worse, that I had devoted precious reading time to a novel that is only a prequel to his next one. It's one thing to imagine how history might have turned out differently but to imagine how people might have turned out (J.E.B. Stuart survives the Civil War) is merely alternative psychology. If I was Turtledove I would have had the blowhard Custer get slaughtered by Indians in exactly the same way as at Little Big Horn. That would show us that history often doesn't change all that much."
4,It begins,"In 1863, the Confederacy successfully seceded from the Union. This book tells of a new war between the USA and the CSA, taking place in the 1880s. Warfare has changed a lot in twenty years, and the military leaders of both sides must come to bloody terms with Gatling guns, fast-firing artillery, and trench warfare. The viewpoint characters are amusing and interesting portrayals of real people. Sam Clemens (Mark Twain), for example, is working as an editor in San Francisco, while the aging Abraham Lincoln wanders the country spreading Marxist ideology. Such individuals give the book a great sense of period. There is also Fredrick Douglas and numorous other cameos by other famous people of this periodOverall-While it may not be th ebest of Harry's books it does provide good background for the rest of the ""World War"" serise"
2,"interesting storyline, but unreadable","I am disappointed with this book. It has such an interesting storyline, the rebs winning the Civil War (Called the ""War of Secession"" in this book), Abe Lincoln being defeated in 1864 and becoming a traveling socialist lecturer, and a second war between the states breaking out in 1881. However, this book is so hard to read with Turtledove's overbearing and pedantic writing style. Sorry, but I will stick to Gingrich and Forstchen, Robert Conroy, and John Birmingham for my alternative history needs."
3,"A FirstRate ""What-If Book""","Not a Sequel to ""The Guns of the South"" I was at first disappointed. However being a fine story in its own right, this is still a good read."
1,really?,so I opened my American DJ flurry and I found that the bracket and the remote control that I'm suppose to connect to the unit is not anywhere in the box. I didn't give up hope and thought perhaps I would be able to manually use the machine. well once I plugged in the machine......nothing!!! Right now its an expensive paper weight and my party is tomorrow. So now I'm scrambling with local rental companies and Bestbuys to find another machine. So aggravated and so disappointed with this purchase....this was going to be the highlight of my party. I order from amazon all the time and I'm surprised that this is a product that they would promote. I did not need one more thing on my to do list just to replace a useless piece of equipment. Not happy!
2,Review for Kindle Edition only (not content),"Formatting is very good. However, while the linked TOC is there and enabled on the go-to menu (broken on some other Penguin editions), there is no links to individual poems. Nor are there annotated links.This would normally be a passable edition, but if the publisher is charging a hefty $17 (the same amount as paper), then there had better be some technical jazz and other content to make it worthwhile."
1,"Good mount for notebook screens, horrible picture","I got one of these since it was mac compatible with 3rd party drivers (check out macam). It worked on the mac, but had horrible picture quality on both mac and PC. It's just a cheap older-generation device with very grainy and washed out low-light performance.I bought an Philips SPC900NC for the mac, much better due to the CCD (instead of the CMOS sensor in the Creative webcam).I've tried to contact Creative for a few support requests, even about using this on a normal PC. They're very unresponsive and unhelpful, and the drivers are sometimes buggy (need a reboot to get the cam to work when it was working fine before). I'll be buying a different company's product next time, simply due to support."
1,Creative Webcam with Clip,The product is of very poor quality.The image hardly refreshes when connected to yahoo and most of all the picture is grainy and color is very dull.The picture will scare you off!!...Please go for other model.This model is not at all upto the expectation.Thanks and RegardsKaushik Datta
3,The softwares or drivers have some problems.,It stoped at 5% of the install process. I am annoyed about that.
2,disappointing - can't ajust the fit,"I was looking for headphones to use at the gym without a cord, which tends to get tangled on things from time to time. I have generally been happy with Monster products in the past. The sound is OK - not great, but acceptable given the price. The big negative is that the the fit of the headphone is not-at-all adjustable. The rely just on the springiness of the plastic to keep them on your ears, so they feel like they are going to slip or fall off constantly. Might be OK on a stationary bike, but bad if you are in motion."
1,Very disappointed--shoddy construction and way overpriced,"Mine worked acceptably well in the gym and was a good solution to having the shuffle attached somewhere, plus the phones, etc. Unfortunately it was out-of-proportion expensive and hasn't come down in price and VERY flimsy -- so that eventually it just broke--even under light use. I would replace it except for the ripoffski price and the probability the new one would break again."
2,cheaply made,"The idea is great but within a month of folding it up and taking it to the gym, the folding part broke. The hinges are cheap, cheap, cheap. The shuffle attachment is great and the fit is comfortable but the folding up part of the contraption is poorly made despite the obvious desire for owners of this headset to use it in active situations. Am going to try the flexible wired design by other vendors."
4,Cordless headphones,"These headphones are OK but not for me. Just don't understand what the point is. I got them as a gift which was a nice thought but don't like them. Sound is good, but I'll stick with my shuffle stuck to shirt and small ear buds running up to my neck rather than this bulky ear muff thing."
3,"iPOD Shuffle Headphones, too big for many..","Bought these headphones to use while running with my ipod shuffle. They work just fine but are quite large. That is, if you have big head (physically) they are probably great. I have an average sized (female) head and they are too big. I was really hoping they would work but the smallest setting was still too big. The sound was fine so I don't want to be too negative about them, just know that they are really made for adult men."
4,Joe's adventure to 1932,This book is about a kid named Joe Stoshack who travels back in time to 1932 to see if Babe Ruth called his shot or not. Read this book to find out if he did or not.This book was great! I really liked the book because I play baseball just like Babe.If you like baseball you will really like this book too!
4,Pretty Good Book,"This is a pretty good book, but a little gross. This time, Joe AND his dad go back in time. They get alot of great stuff, but don't get to bring it home. Why? Why don't you read the book?"
5,Autobiography of an Argentine Nationalist,"Carlos Ibarguren, my wife's great grand father, was a typicall Argentine nationalist. In this book he tells his own life from the moment he left his province(Salta) upto the fall of president Ortiz. He participated in the Uriburu administration, as governor of the province of Córdoba.You'll find the ideas of a corporativist thoroughly explained, and stories of conspiracy and revolution. He describes accurately the social, economic and political causes that move Argentine history for more than sixty years. Culture is also delightfully described in several chapters. Ibarguren is one of the great representatives of the Argentine revisionist history writers, and this book is certainly an example."
3,Not bad...very historically acurate but could have better instructions,I found the figures to be very accurate but at the same time I think it would have been better if they were easier to make.
4,Another very nice Built product.,We bought this product for our son in law. I really am impressed by Built products as they are constructed very well. They work as advertised and carry six bottles or cans. Great for days at the beach.
5,Pleasantly...pleased...,"Ordered the Escape and Eternity, I'm not certain about the escape scent it's been a few years since I've worn, but Eternity seemed to match the spot. Umm...but anyhow, the service was great so I will buy again in future, package arrived same day/within minutes of other items ordered with supposedly speedy 2 day service. Great turnaround. Will get HugoBoss next, larger bottles maybe...Thanks."
1,YOU WILL NOT FIND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IN THIS BOOK,"UNFORTUNATLY , THIS BOOK DID NOT PROFIDE ME WITH TECNICAL TOOLES TO ANALYSE FINANCIAL STATMENT , THE CASE STUDIES HAS ONLY FEW THINGS TO TEL , I THINK IT IS A GENERAL BOOK IN CREDIT MANAGEMENT ."
3,Moderate power,"Pros:- Simple design, easy setup.- Moderate repelling power.- No AC power needed.- Good solar charging efficiency.Cons:- ""Moderate"" power means shorting out if weeds are present in fence line.- May not be suitable for goats, or other critters that require a little more shock to get their attention.Overall, this unit would likely suit for remote locations with animals that are easily controllable.Most AC-connected units I've tried have more ""umph"" than this unit."
1,I still smell cigarette smoke in my apt. from one or more of my neighbor(s) who smoke.,"I believe this company has been falsely advertising the elimination of odors on its packaging. When I emailed a woman representative from this company, she stated that her product will not eliminate cigarette smoke odor. I feel cheated. I have had this product for several weeks."
1,Brave Companions,One-star rating because I've just downloaded it. There is no table of contents in the Kindle Edition. Why not? How annoying! Why isn't this information given to the prospective purchaser?
4,"good information on Unix for scientists, but dated (published in 1993)","I would echo the other favorable reviews. This is a good book on Unix for scientific programmers. Since the book was written in 1993, predating widespread adoption of Linux, there is a lot of material on commercial versions of Unix that is less important now. The Unix shell languages and tools such as make, sed and awk are mentioned, but not scripting languages such as Python and Perl. The gnuplot graphing program is discussed. The scientific programming languages discussed are Fortran 77 and C.Since used copies of the book are available inexpensively, I recommend it to scientific programmers using Linux."
2,Not what it says it is.,The add was very diseaving. The add makes it sound like you get all the masks. Plus I didn't even get the one they showed as a display. [...] Thank you.
1,a very painful read,"I thought this book was bordering on emotional and sexual abuse, he treated her like a [scarlet woman], such a painful read for me, i had to shelf it, but she is a very gifted author, I love her other books."
2,"Hmmmmm, this one is lacking","I found this one to be an exercise in patience. Much of the dialog seems to be just filler, while in space and on station. Things happen seemingly just to stretch out the story. It drags on with common, every day elements rather than taking me somewhere I haven't been before. The relationships between characters is sometimes like being back in hi-school. I would have enjoyed more of a cut-to-the-chase pace, with more attention given to some of the background players. Cherryh has become one of my favorites (Downbelow Station is incredible), but I felt like I was doing my own heavy time on this one."
5,Exactly waht I was looking for.,"I wanted this for my baby's room and after going through 2 other heaters I was afraid I was never going to find the right one. Well- I'm glad I finally ordered this one. The heater is safe (with the auto shut off) and quiet. Also- it provides gentle, effective heat throughout the entire room.I think its a tiny bit pricey but its worth every penny."
3,"A Nice Little Heater, But Hard To Clean!","This is a well-designed and efficient little heater, but very hard to clean. If you own a shedding dog or cat, the vortex action of the heater will draw any loose hair in the environment into the casing where it will burn on the hot coils. The smell is awful and the only solution is to take the heater apart to clean it. The procedure requires special tools, good eyesight, moderate mechanical skill and patience and is highly discouraged by the manufacturer. If no one in your household sheds, and you keep your floors meticulously clean, you will likely get a few years good use of the heater before having to take it apart."
2,Digital Vortex Heater,This is the second space heater I have owned. I thought the first one was a fluke but I'm already having trouble with the second one. The fan sometimes does not go on and the whole unit gets very hot. Have to keep turning on and off and put it on fan to get started. Once its on its great...if I can only get it on sometimes. Buyer beware. Unfortunately I can't find my receipts so I couldn't contact the company to get it changed.
1,broken when received,"just like the worst reviews, our heater arrived and wouldn't turn on. never got to use it and returned it.frustrating--would not order again"
1,Returned twice,"Although the concept of this heater seemed great, it did not live up to expectations. I had to return it twice before giving up on it entirely. It did heat the space quite nicely, but it would randomly just shut off on its own. When I contacted the company the first time, they said it should never shut off unless turned off. This was critical in my case because I was concerned about freezing temperatures - not acceptable."
3,Loved it then soooo disappointed.,"Bought this heater for our young daughter's room last winter. We did use it every night but were sure to shut it off every morning. The consistant temp. option was great as I'm sure it helped her sleep through the night with no chill/hot fluctuations since she didn't know how to use a blanket yet. When the weather finally started to warm up we still used the unit to circulate the air as it was a weird summer and didn't warrant the air conditioning much at all but the circulation of air was very nice. I'd say we used the Vornado slightly more than ""average"" use.Our first snow of 2009 was last weekend....the Vornado was broke. We turned it to ""heat"" for the first time this season and the unit would just shut off. I would have expected this unit to last at least a year!! Hopefully it's just a lemon as the unit was great when it worked. We do plan on buying two more and giving them a second chance but I have read other reviews with the same problem...."
2,Great until it breaks,"I bought this heater last season, and It no long works. This heater does a great job heating a surprisingly large space. Its quiet and fairly safe around children. The rocker switch to turn it on does not hold up to the heat that the unit creates, causing it to turn off/on and eventually die completely. I am trying to replace the switch but so far no luck."
3,Leaves something to be desired,Although the heater is extremely quiet and heats well...it keeps reseting the desired temp on its own every three of four days. Ive contacted Vornado twice and have yet to get a response. Works fantastic if you dont mind having to continuously reset the temp. Think Ive got a lemon that I cant get them to respond to. A for the heater.....F for their warranty and service
3,Works fine,"When I first got this space heater almost a year ago, I would have given it 5 stars, but I've noticed that it sometimes blows cool air at my legs, even though I never change the setting. It seems to me that a space ""heater"" should never cool, just heat, even if the thermostat wants to turn off the heat at that point. But the heater looks nice and generally works fine."
3,Yes and No Voranado,"Yes. It does heat very well, cabinet stays cool. My problems are: 1) It interferes with AM radio reception even when in a far away room in the house. You really cannot listen to any AM station while the heater is on; 2) there are no ""grab"" handles, only an indentation which make it slippery and hard to grasp to move around. This is a major drawback for us. Otherwise it's the best I've ever had, heating-wise."
3,heater,Have always been a Vornado customer..so I was disapointed by the failure to stay on for long periods of time. I returned 1 unit only to have the same unit returned to me. I guess they tried it for a short time and decided it works. Well it does not work!!I think I'm stuck with this defective unit.
4,Love it!,this heater does just what it says. i've used it on the cold new england monrnings we've had lately and it works. i have a 1000sf great room with hard wood floors and it takes the chill off. in smaller rooms it generates enough heat to turn off my baseboard!
1,Vornado EH1-0028-06,"EH1-0028-06 This is a very dangerous product, The cord gets extremely hot, causing the outlet to turn dark black, I notice a burning smell and checked the heater and the outlet was on fire. Luckly We were able to put the fire out before it caught the house on fire, I would not recommend this product to anyone. If you do buy it or already have one check the out let often!!!"
2,Good heater but I got noisy ones,"I have been using this model heater and found it very good. I generates a steady soft breeze and warms the air at the right comfortable temperature, not just periodically blowing out hot air. So I bought two additional ones.They both made audible annoying fluf-fluf-fluf sound that interfered with my watching TV or working on computer. I had to refund one and replaced the other. Fortunately, the replacement is quiet and I am keeping that one.This is a good heater, but you take chances and hope you don't get the noisy ones when you order. Vernado needs to look into its QC for this heater."
2,Didn't work as expected,"I was a little disappointed in this product, after seeing all of the rave reviews that it got. What we have is a brick house that is a little cold in the winter. I wanted something to help heat the living room, so we didn't have to fire the furnace constantly. The living room is about 15x20 with one end open to the stairs and dining room. I think this is the problem. This heater didn't put out enough heat to even create a noticable difference in this room. Should it have? I don't know. In all fairness we tried several different types of heaters (ceramic and convection) and they didn't do the job either. Even an Edenpure heater did nothing. But I was hoping that with the reviews that this heater got, that it would have been the one to work. It wasn't. Maybe it would work much better in a smaller room that didn't have big openings like the living room does. Don't know because I returned the product."
4,"Nice Little Heater, But Not Super Powerful","The heater is surprisingly lightweight and seems adequate - nothing too fancy. The plastic exterior has the feel of a sub-$40 product but it seems solid enough. The heater works as advertised, although it is not super powerful. I work in a basement office where I keep the home thermostat at 65. I was hoping the heater would warm my desk area to something more comfortable. It definitely helps, but even when left on the Hi setting continuously, with the heater set to 73, it never manages to get much past 68. I live in Georgia and the daytime temps right now average around 45 so it's not like I'm really challenging the heater. I had hoped for a more dramatic effect. That said, I'm still happy with the purchase ($88, including shipping) and have no regrets."
4,Works great and is quiet!,This room heater works fine for me. It heats my 12 x 12 den very well and is amazingly quiet. It maintains whatever temperature I set and circulates the heat without the irritating sound of a noisy blower fan. Good value for the money. I would have given it 5 stars if it came in colors other than black. White or cream color would have worked better in my room
2,Loud and unreliable,"I've owned my Vornado for about a year and a half. I've already had to return it once because the on/off switch stopped functioning (not damaged, just stopped working). Paid Vornado $45 for the repair.Recently, the fan has started getting much louder to where I really can't run it at night and still sleep. I'm either looking at another $45 repair or tossing it and buying a new heater. If I do replace, it likely won't be with another Vornado."
2,heater or noisemaker?,"holy crap.... is this a heater or a grade A noise machine (not the good kind)? just got home with this little devil ($100 lighter) and after reading all of the instructions i plugged it in to begin heating. well,...it actually seems to be heating just fine, BUT it is making a terrible buzzing noise, the little squeaky kind of buzzing that almost seems like it should only be heard by dogs or something. unfortunately for us, that is not the case.i give this an F unless their objective was to put my child in an insane asylum at an early age.i'll take it back, of course, and we'll be no worse for wear, but don't waste your time as i did. i read another review mentioning this buzzing and ignored it as it was the only review that did so. however, my experience was exactly the same."
5,"quiet, good quality","This is my third heater, all still working perfectly. Quiet and consistent quality. The digital controls are especially useful and easy to use."
3,"Play that decidedly unfunky music, white boys!","Pernice Bros music is easier to admire than to like. There's no denying the polished songcraft, the clever wordplay, and the hooks-a-plenty -- but, unfortunately, there's also no avoiding the bland musicianship, the unearned smugness, the too-fussed-over arrangemnets, and (here comes the deal-breaker) the complete and utter absense of Soul. Note the capital ""S"" -- it's important...."
5,Learn COM and VB with fun !!,"If you know VB but never felt the presence of COM in your development, then this book is the right one to make you realize that you know COM too. There were lots of books on COM which describe this technology from the C++ perspective. It is a great work, although price could have been little less. I like this book as a development companion."
5,excellent for starters,"I am new to VBCOM, and I think that Thomas Lewis did an excellent job at explaining the subject. It did not take me very long to read it, and I feel that I can go on to another book about the subject. One that is more into details, and has more information. It did the job though, of explaining the basics and behind the scenes functionality of VB COM. Thanks Mr. Lewis. Thanks WROX!"
5,Still Movin',"What a mix! CJ Mackintosh does very well on the compilation, and I would dare anyone to state otherwise :)In a nutshell, buy the CD and save yourself the suspense of wondering why I made the above statement..."
2,o.k,"this computer game is okay. I played it a ton of times, and i could never solve it. it can get frusterating at times, for sometimes i get lost in the place. if you want a fun game, don't get this one."
1,Very disapointed in this stone,"I used it the first time to bake biscuits and it worked great. The next time while preheating the stone the oil from the biscuits that soaked into the stone smelled so bad I had to remove it from the oven. Needless to say, after only one use it is now history. I would certainly not recommend this particular stone at all."
2,Broke after 2nd use,"Broke after 2nd use. I had a pampered chef stone for over 13 years and never had a problem. Due to an unfortunate accident the pampered chef stone had to be replaced. This was a cheaper way to get a stone faster than ordering pc. Received this just before Christmas and used it as directed once, the second time it cracked in half."
1,COULDN'T DOWNLOAD THIS AT ALL,I was completely unable to download this CD on my computer; it kept saying there it was infected with a virus. Too bad as this is one of my favorite games and previous versions worked on previous computers but not his one. Bummer.
1,"""FAREWELL"" contains both DVD and CD","Benny Goodman's ""Farewell"" contains BOTH a CD and DVD version of this product,Farewell, and is at a bargain price! I like to have BOTH formats rather than just one, don't you? The performance of this WONDERFUL concert is a five star; the one star is based on the fact that you can buy both formats of the performance for a less expensive price than this one format alone."
2,Disappointing.....,"After reading the reviews on this book, I decided on the spot to order it. Although it has many thought-provoking questions in it, they definitely arn't life changing. It is a decent book, but it didn't meet my expectations. If you are a very religious or spiritual person, this may be your style."
2,Disappointing,"With the exception of the first disc, I found set 1 disappointing. The unlikely relationship between David Hayman's character and that of Kate Buffery was tedious and spoiled the series. The story lines, though dark, are gripping; and had the roles for the leading actors been written differently, the series would definitely have had a great deal more appeal. I see the possibility of improvements in set 2 (having just watched set 2, disk 2)."
4,Always left hanging,"The acting is outstanding. The stories are gritty and true to life. Most aspects of this series are excellent. The constant use of split screen technique...not so much. It becomes distracting and does little to enhance story telling. What hurts this series most are the endings. We are left waiting for some sort of an answer at the end of each and every episode, instead we're left watching that black screen with the credits rolling. Note to Lynda LaPlante ""A little payoff for the audience please, after all the emotional investment in the well drawn characters we want some retribution""."
3,Ehh...,"This is your typical SyFy movie fare. Take a idea that has a bit of science to it and then just blow it up with a storyline and some cheesy romance and stuff. Ice Twisters... well, it's what it sounds like. Ice twisters attack at seemingly random, leaving people frozen to death. The story is barely scientific, any experienced meteorologist or scientist could see through the plot holes. Still, if it's a cheesy, SyFy movie worth a few laughs you're looking for, here it is."
4,above average B film,"as a devotee of 50s sci-fi, this reviewer has rather a soft spot for B or made for TV films especially in the science fiction genre. It always occurs to me that the director, actors and crew are probably grateful for the opportunity and very often their hard work, within the constraints of a tight budget and schedule, are very much in evidence. Admittedly in this movie liberties are taken with science and some of the actors' reactions (to 'cgi shot to be inserted here' scenes) are a little underplayed but on the whole this is a good, tight 'renegade weather' movie that held my attention from the first to the last minute. A poor relation to 2012 it may be but it proves a huge budget is not required to produce an entertaining sci-fi film and in a comparison of dialogue and character rendition with 2012 for me Ice Twisters wins hands down."
2,For Railroad Fans,"If you are an old railway man(or a new railroad man) I am sureyou will love this book. I am a real fan of Freeman's booksbut in buying this one, I didnt bone up on what it was allabout. All I saw was Inspector French (and I am a real fan ofhis). As Freeman,s first occupation was on the railroad I amsure those fans would get a joy out of this book."
1,Odor Enhancing Bags,"This product does the opposite of what it claims. Rather than mask stink, these bags noticeably enhance it. We have to change them everyday even if they are only half full, because the odor is absolutely unbearable and wafts throughout the entire condo. We NEVER had this problem with regular, non-shield bags. Did they just not test these things or is Glad just playing a massive hoax on its consumers? FAIL."
5,Colorful and original,I just discovered Nalo Hopkinson. Wow. Lovely writing and original narrative material. I will be reading everything she has written as soon as I can get my hands on the books. I enthusiastically agree with all the other more detailed and very positive reviews.
1,Snoozer,"I didn't like Brown Girl in the Ring so I'm not sure why I bothered with Midnight Robber, other than that it was nominated for a Hugo. I regret it. It's a real snoozer. If you want something to bore you to death (or to sleep), this is the book for you."
1,Yuck!,"YUCK. It's the Olsen Twins, the two most exploited child stars in the world. It's disgusting to see people getting rich off of two LITTLE KIDS. They can't sing at all, but hey, they have blonde hair and blue eyes. Let's all just exploit them."
3,Good + Bad = Average,"Several high points worth noting include: solid writing, interesting stories to illustrate points, and a few useful pointers for people who want to tell better stories.These high points were balanced by several low points such as: gets rather boring halfway through (takes a long time to get to major points), pointers are offered with inadequate structure to make them useful, and a focus on what a story does instead of how to.I liked the book, but I didn't love it. I would recommend it for general background reading, but I would not recommend it for learning storytelling."
2,"Not instructional, but well written","Simply put, I found little instruction on how to be a good storyteller. That being said, this book is well written and gives a good argument about the importance and helpfulness of story in business situations...just do not expect to learn methods."
4,"How to use ""once upon a time"" all of the time","Annette Simmons is thoroughly convincing in her assertion that the best way to influence and inspire others is to tell stories. Unfortunately, she is a bit heavy-handed on the ""why"" of storytelling, which she explains in depth in every chapter, and a shade light regarding ""how"" to accomplish her lofty goals. Simmons explains that telling people an engaging story is far more persuasive than reciting facts and figures, or showing a PowerPoint presentation. To illustrate her position, Simmons uses good stories and parables as examples. She describes the six categories of stories you can use to connect with and influence people, and she offers suggestions on how to become a prolific, entertaining storyteller. This is not a typical ""how-to"" book with lists of things to do, but it is instructive and useful. We recommend it to anyone who is interested in the art of persuasion or who loves a good yarn."
4,Great story telling,Haven't finished this little gem yet (it's in a pile with 19 others I'm working through) but what I've read so far is delightfully re-assuring that story telling is the best way to convey our ideas and influence others to action. Annette Simmons has a very readable how to and why book on her hands. Thanks Annette.
3,Its ok.,"This book is a very informative book on what s important when you are telling a story and the factors that people are looking from you, as posture, emotions, etc. It has a lot of good stories inside it. Its not a How to Create your own story. It give you tips. Your story is your story but when you tell it you can use the skills that Annette wrote in here. I liked more the WHoever Tells the best story wins book by Annette. The Whoever boook was more plain and go direectly to the data. This Story Factor is more repetitive on some themes. Always I like to keep reading because in some areas it had very good info."
1,Superficial,"I love a good story. This book had possibilities for telling a good story but, in my opinion, didn't make it. I read the first chapter in bits, trying to let it find its way into me. Second chapter, I flew past pages, looking simply at headlines and a line or two of type. Yawn. I finish somewhere in the middle after skipping quite a bit of the first half with the bit on...oh, gee I can't even remember. There were 10 somethings, or was it 6?I find it trite and repetitive and borders on the manipulative. It's not quite academic and certainly not creative and gives no new insights so is hardly even self-helpish.Storytelling is becoming a trend in many disciplines and I wonder if the author, a business-oriented person by the description on the back flap, is simply jumping on the bandwagon in order to capitalise on good ideas of others."
5,Storytelling by a Proven Teller,"Author Annette Simmons invites readers to get inside the story tellers skin and experience story telling vicariously. Annette has lived what she advocates. Furthermore, being a story teller myself, I resonate to Annette's dividing of stories in to major generic types."
2,It does not deliver what it promisses,"I bought this book during a recent business trip to the US, hoping that it would ""teach"" a few tips on how to build your own personal stories, facts and so on.To my disapointment the author does not do that. She goes on and on preaching the benefits of using stories, how wonderful they are, the impact they can have on peoples life and so on. But she never stops to discuss the structure of a good story, how to identify your own mistakes when constructing one and keep improving your own technics. SO if you are looking for a book that will tell you how important a stoty is and the situations it can be used, perhaps you will benefit from this work. If you are beyond that level, sorry this is not it.To be honest, after reading all the positives reviews from other readers I was left with a simple question: Did I read the same book they have??"
1,Poor Sounding In My Opinion,"What's with all the positive reviews on these headphone's sound? Maybe I just happened to buy a defective pair(bought them at 6th Ave. Electronics for about $50.). But I have a small suspicion that most of them, if not all of them, sound this bad. The trebble sounds way too thin, tinny and steely at a normal setting. Even with the bass from half-way to all the way up, there isn't much of a difference. Only with some recordings, these headphones sound okay. But it's certainly not enough for me to keep them or exchange them for the same product for reasons I stated above. Sorry Koss, but I'm going with the Sony V6!"
3,"Cute, comfy, not obnoxious lights","Light-up shoes are not my first choice, but these look decent. Nothing about the design is particularly out of character with any boy's shoe, even older kids. I would rate them four or five stars, except that one month after wearing the shoes three to four times a week, the lights have ""gone out"" one of the shoes."
2,only scratches the surface of a complex subject,"Life Cycle Assessment requires a more comprehensive and thorough approach than the author provides. Areas are left open, and the book raises more questions for the reader than the answers it provides. It is not a text that I will refer to to repond to critical questions. It was a disappointment to me."
1,Poor product and equally POOR customer support,Purchase this heater . Had for 4 months and it worked fine. One day the swithch would not turn on. tried everything the sticker suggested. Finally called the customer service for Lasko. They Claim they have a three year waranty. Well they did not have a waranty registration by either email or card. They wanted the original sales receipt. Well of couse I did not have this. So nothing the worthless company could do. NO offer of a replaceemnt part or heater. I also check the Lasko web site. They have many product recalls for faulty heaters causing fires. So I guess I am lucky my heater quit and did not burn down my home.
3,good looking heater with some issues,"Good things first: decent heater, decent looking and relatively quiet. Well, it's not that quiet but it could be worse. It's good enough that I'm happy with it.Now for the bad: the remote control doesn't work, and no, I'm not sending it back just for the remote. It's just disappointing. And also, Amazon sent mine in its original box (They always double-box their stuff, so I'm not sure why they sent this one in its original box). And UPS did a lovely job destroying the box, and maybe that's why the remote doesn't work. With the squashed box and amateurish tape job, it almost seems like they sent me a used one or an open-box. Either way, I'm not happy with Amazon. I expected better."
1,Very Noisy,"This is an attractive heater and it heats my large bedroom effectively. Unfortunately, it is very loud; I'm not sure if this s normal for this model."
3,I am pleased with the amount of heat it throws out,What I don't understand is why the red button at the bottom of the unit stays lit even when I shut it off???????? Can anyone answer me?
4,Awesome Except for .......,This heater is stylish and works extremely well. All function settings work consistently. Remote works great. The only concern is that it does not have a tip over / auto shut off feature. This may be a concern with small children of pets.
2,Strong chemical smell,"The heater works fine. It is quiet, which I particularly like. But it has a strong chemical smell to it. I'm not generally particularly sensitive to smells, but this one is pretty strong. I once bought a toaster from Amazon that had the same smell, and the smell eventually went away. I'm hoping the smell for this heater will eventually go away too. Without the smell, I would have given it four stars."
3,Attractive but Powerless,"If the rating were based solely on looks, this heater would get 5 stars. It's a unique and attractive product. It is also very quiet. The problems with this heater are: 1. It doesn't put out a lot of heat. Even on high power and at the highest temperature setting, you can barely feel it if you're sitting more than a couple feet away. It hasn't warmed any room in our house bigger than the bathroom [although the instructions say not to use it in the bathroom -- and also not to use it in the shower(!!)]. 2. The range of oscillation is quite small (even my easy-to-please husband noticed it). 3. As much as we move this heater around, it would be very nice if it came with a handle. 4. Interestingly, the remote for this heater will control our Lasko fan and vice versa. This can pose a small problem if you have the two near each other."
5,These units replaced our furnace!,"The furnace in our newly purchased home died on December 20th. As we live in New York, this was VERY bad news. We decided to buy some space heaters until we could figure out how to proceed. We have one of these in each bedroom, and two larger Lasko units in the living room and kitchen. We couldn't be happier with their performance. It's been very cozy in the house, except the cold floors, of course. The temperature can be selected in five degree increments from 60 - 80, high or low fan speed, and oscillation mode. It's tiny, but it sure does the job. Have used these four units as our only heat source and our electric bill was a whopping $4 higher for the month. That's FOUR DOLLARS, people! Plus, they look really cool. Kind of like a little patio chiminea in my bedroom. Highly recommended."
4,Exactly what I wanted,"I use heater fans for my studio apt and I love them. My current one sound like it is on it's last leg and when I saw this one on sale I decided to buy it. Even though it is summer I still had to test it. I love the remote and the fact that is oscillates. It has nice design and the earth tone blends in with my living room. The box that it was shipped in was in perfect shape but the box the item was in, was a little beat up. I did not see any creaks, breakage, or chips. I can't wait to use in the winter. I think my guest will be impress. This is an unusual design."
2,Not as I had hoped...,"I purchased this heater 2 weeks ago based on the reviews and while it keeps my bedroom cool instead of cold, it doesn't WARM IT UP as I had hoped. It's a very cute little heater, that is relatively quiet, but I expected more for the money I paid. It's definitely not worth $50, maybe $25 tops. It just doesn't put out enough heat--you have to be right in front of it to feel any heat. I will be returning it."
1,I returned this product,"It kept tripping the circuit breaker, my house is only 5 years old, and California has ridiculously high standards for new construction. Bought another heater, uses less energy and does not trip the breaker."
4,MOK,"Mostly OK--Attractive, works well,quite--The composite material does emit a slight odor. Quirky controls will not allow certain functions--Cannot set choice of temperature without the unit changing to high--Have had in use about two weeks"
4,Reliable and Powerful,"I'm on my third winter with this space heater, and I'm very satisfied. Very powerful and doesn't blow out the breaker, which is a common problem for me living in a mobile home. The only real concern I have is that most space heaters have a feature that shuts them off if they tip over. I don't know if this model is supposed to have that feature but I've tipped it just to see if it would shut off and it doesn't."
2,Started out great,I bought this and after a couple months of usage the rotation broke and remote does not work anymore. It does an ok job of heating still but it is probably just a matter of time before that fails to.
1,Terrible shipping experience,"Ordered item over a month ago, and recieved shipping confirmation within 2 days. Finally recieved cookbook almost a month and a half later, with the box confirming it was shipped a week after we recieved confirmation it did. They claim shipping to an FPO address takes longer, but I recieved other items shipped to this same address faster than a week.Seller even requested I remove my 2-star rating after not receiving it for three weeks, despite the fault being theirs."
5,Dance and Be Fit: Brazilian Body,"I fell absolutely in love with Kimberly Miguel Mullen after I watched her video, ""Dance and Be Fit: Brazilian Body."" She is so energetic, amazingly beautiful and in great shape (I will get there someday!). Besides all these things, the workout is a fun challenge and definitely gets the heart rate up and keeps it up! I've always been interested in Capoeira but never knew where to take classes. I definitely want to look more into it after doing it with the video. Thank you Acacia for another great video!"
1,A joke,"This product is a joke; there is no fitness here; no instruction comes with the DVD, and the folks look so fake...Brazilian Body? I don't think so, not with this lame routine."
1,Never received it,Looked good on the mini video. Tried to buy it but never got it. Amazonquickly refunded the sale which is the good news.
1,No instruction here...,"I'll agree that the instructor is very likeable. She has a nice voice, isn't overly bubbly or annoying, and is pleasant to watch. However, I could not keep up with, or figure out, what she was doing most of the time. If you look closely at the video, there are times when her ""standing"" leg was clearly doing things that were never mentioned while the moving leg was doing something else. I'm young-ish, and somewhat coordinated, and experienced with workout videos of all sorts. This needs instruction and breakdown to be useful. Too bad there were so many positive reviews. I don't see how you can perform the moves correctly by watching this video, and if I was just going to dance and do whatever I felt like, I'd put on a cd and dance. Check this one out from the library if you can before buying."
4,"Blue Thunder, eat your heart out!","Reading this old early-1990s dime novel series in the newmillenium makes it rather amusing. Crime got so bad in the '90s thatGeorge Bush created the US Tactical Police Force at the end of his second term to replace most federal law-enforcement agencies: the stunts these guys pull make Waco look like a kitchen fire. To top it off, they fly what ultimately amounts to military attack helicopters. It's a good choice for anybody who was into ""Blue Thunder"" and ""Airwolf,"" but the hairbrained, inaccurate predictions featured within--such as the Nicaragua Wars and the end of the US automotive industry--caused it to lose a star."
4,Isinis Large Cushioned Hair Brush * Ball Tip * Made In France,"When I read the other reviews, I was skeptical. It is a brush, after all. I do love it especially for my fine hair and find it also keeps it more smooth looking. I dropped it a couple times on the tile floor and it has not broken. I would consider replacing other travel brushes with this style in the future."
5,Reccomended by the accidental quilter,"I bought this book to learn more about designing quilts. Margaret Miller encourages the reader to play with two basic geometric shapes. This frees up the beginner from being overwhelmed by complicated construction techniques and able to play with quilt design. The quilts selected for inclusion in this volume also have a great deal of motion built into the design, so it gives the reader a chance to study how this is done. If you want to learn more about design, color, and motion of quilts--this is an excellent resource. Color examples that are my favorites include Marty Kutz's ""Fall Frost"" (pg. 60),Grace Crocker's ""Quilt Virus""(pg. 66), Maureen Roy's ""Sisters""(pg. 100), and Nancy Meyer's ""The Inside Story.""(pg. 51). All of the examples in this book are contemporary style quilts. mary cox the accidental quilter"
5,good stuff!,"I was looking for this lube oil for my clippers for a while and finally realized I should look on amazon...it's pretty much the only one offered, so it's what I got. It's works great. No problems. Cheap."
4,great as ever but different layout on cards,"great as ever, but I personally didn't like the different picture on the back of the cards, even if ""powerful"", I preferred the old feather to this thunder..."
2,Cards were not correctly punched,The medicine cards were not correctly punched - one corner was missed. I would like to get another copy of cards - medicine cards are too important and personal items - they have to be correct and feel right. I hope that it is possible to get a new copy.
5,battery pack,this thing is so helpful like while your in the car you can play that without spending money on alot of batteries
1,Priced to sell,Make sure you get Ludlow to pay you $10.50 to read this book rather than the other way around.I wonder what they'll do with all of the unbought copies of this book -- bleach the pages and print Coulter's next screed on it I guess.
2,good joke gift,"this would probably make a great joke gift for the holidays--just make sure you don't give it to someone who's been laid off or foreclosed. I can see why the author hangs out with the great economic genius Larry Kudlow. Just realized it was endorsed by the flat-brained, rich-by-inheritance Steve Forbes!!!!"
1,A modern fairly tale,"If you run out of the Brothers Grimm fairy tales, or books about goats like the ones King George likes, this modern day fairy tale will help put your to sleep. Read the book, but remember to read the disclaimer ""Boom applies to Halliburton shareholders only. Individual user results will vary."""
1,Misleading information,"The real problem with this book is that Bowyer is not an economist and it shows. He is a skilled polemicist, and his arguments are undoubtedly going to sway the crowd that was inclined to believe him in the first place. However, he misrepresents and misuses economic data. If you want to understand trickle-down economic theory, read Milton Friedman, a true giant. This book is destined for the 99-cent bin by Christmas, so save your money.Who is the guy writing all the reviews from ""Princeton""? He seems to be writing under multiple profiles. By the way, these identical reviews are also coming from ""Chicago"" if you open this page on your computer at work. My guess is that the mystery reviewer is either Bowyer or Kudlow."
1,The Bush boom? More radical conservative propaganda...,"This book will be in the bargain bin before too long. If the author is the guy I think he is, he's this low rated talk show host in small-market Pittsburgh. I like the idea that a guy (George Bush) who cannot put a complete sentence together is this economic genius who fixed the struugling economy. Conservatives believe what they want so maybe they'll buy this. Maybe if you read it as satire, it could be quite funny."
1,How wrong can Jerry Bowyer be?,This book came out in 2003. Here in 2009 the proof has shown Jerry is full of self-reinforcing delusions. But Jerry continues along this same path as a conservative commentator appearing anywhere they will have him. The book is a fun read as an example of how wrong most conservative propaganda such as this turn out to be.
1,This is satire right?,"I didn't know how to rate this book. On the one hand I wanted to give it a high rating for all the laughs. On the other hand it is so poorly written and poorly reasoned that it deserves a 1 star rating.Have you ever been to a movie that was so bad that you actually enjoyed it? If you like movies like that you should buy and read this book.Bush has the worst economic record of any president since Herbert Hoover. Pick a category and check his record. It is a miserable failure. Somehow in the Bowyer and Kudlow universe this is characterized as a ""Bush Boom"". It is surreal."
1,"Welcome to Wonderland, Alice","I am beginning to think that bookstores need to have a special section just for delusional people who buy books. It could sort of be a clearing house for books by people who think the moon landings were faked, that the world is indeed flat, and that slavery both had nothing to do with the Civil War and it really wasn't that bad anyway. Needless to say this book would be in that area.How anyone who makes less than $300,000 a year could possibly think that Bush has brought in boom times is beyond me. They would have to be either really naive, really stupid, or a really partisan Republican. Of course, I do not discount the possibility that all three of these may be present in the same person.The only way I would buy this book is if they perforated the pages so that would tear off easily. That way I could keep it in the bathroom, where it might actually be useful on occasion."
1,Faith-Based Economics,"The author writes: ""It's not as though this man didn't learn things from people who are alive today, or who taught during the reformation era; it's just that his vantage point, his center of gravity was somewhere around 325 AD. So is mine.""That pretty much says it all. This book, which I skimmed in a local Christian bookstore, is full of delusional, ideology-driven lies and half-truths. I you think people out of work and a loss of job s is good, and making the rich richer and the poor poorer (off point of view for a modern Christian, but not for a 325 A.D. Christian), then you'll love this book. Otherwise, ignore this fruitcake."
3,I'm Nervous,This disc was on point. The only thing that made me hate this album is the MC in the background. He was like a sharp pain in your ear everytime you nodded your head. Other than him Mister Cee blended the joints nicely. The song list was tight and NERVOUS perfection.
4,Great for learning medical math,I purchased this book to help me with my pharmacology class. I was able to learn how to calculate medication doses and this book really made it easy and gave lots of exercise problems to help instill the formulas. I did not rate this book a 5 because the first few chapters were of basic math skills which seemed really basic but for someone who is struggling this would be a great book to start a foundation on if you are going into the medical field
1,Classical hatemongering,I would advise readers not to waste their money and time on this book which continues a line of racism and hatred towards Turks who were also subject to Armenian crimes. History cannot be twisted by baseless fictions posed as facts in front of gullible public.
1,not true,"Yes, many ethnic Armenians perished in the period mentioned in the book. No, it was not a genocide. A greater number of ethnic Turks died at the hands of nationalist Armenian bands at the same time and place. People were killing each other all over the place. For it to be a ""genocide"", it would have to be a planned act of extermination of ALL Armenians in the country by the state, and it was not like that. The order was to transport the Armenians in one particular part of the country to another part. Armenians in places like Istanbul were not touched at all. People of all ethnic origins had a very bad time in general. ""Genocide"" is the wrong word here."
1,lasted 1 year,Worked well for six months then lost a key at about a year the touch pad stopped working DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
4,my opinion,"the adesso is a good product, if i had taken the time to set it up right i am sure it would work like a charm. i failed to turn off the computer when i plugged the usb, causing some of the keys to imprint the wrong keystroke. otherwise very good product. john"
5,1st impressions,I just got this after getting a full sized wireless keyboard and mouse. I chose this because it resembles a laptop keyboard with the touch keys I'm used to. This is my test run and it works as expected. The touch pad does what it is suppose to do. I like the very light footprint on my lap and the fact it comes with a dust protector. Since I use my laptop for everything from business to entertainment this item does a great great job and have no complaints.
4,Nice for occasional use,"Like this key board, I purchased it to use with my mac-miniApple Mac mini MB139LL/A (2.0 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 1 GB RAM, 120 GB Hard Drive, SuperDrive)to make it a media PC for my LCD screen.Pros: Small footprint, good to lay around on your TV viewing area.Cons: Turning it on after it hibernates is hit and miss, I think if the mac sleeps then there is nothing to get the two to wake back up, usually have to pull out the bateries.Also don't expect to draw something complex with this keyboard, you need a proper mouse for this."
3,no multi-touch!,"I had this keyboard since 2007 and still works fine. However, the technology needs to be refreshed to meet today's new standards such as multi-touch for all the typical gestures and the addition of a .COM key.This product was the best I could get in 2007, but they have fallen behind the times and really need to refresh this product.I'm taking one star for lack of features on the touch pad other than standard mouse actions. A second star for the large USB wireless adapter (compared to Logitech's smaller usb adapter) and a third for price. $80 for a wireless keyboard is excessive by today's standards.Recommended in general, but there are better alternatives available especially for a home theater setup."
2,No custom setting options,"If you are looking for a keyboard/trackpad that can be customized, this is not it. It is a true plug and play unit, but that is all. You have no options to adjust for the tap speed or turn off tap completely. You can not adjust sensitivity either. If you are alright with no customization, then it is a ok keyboard/trackpad combination."
1,TOTAL PIECE OF JUNK,"The random jumping disappearing cursor, the disappearing text and the total unreliability of this crappy keyboard has driven me crazy. Please don't waste your money! I HATE IT!!! I'm throwing it away. It ought to be illegal to sell something this poorly made.Now I will type the above review without corrections so you will see what it would look like to use this keyboard. BTW, this is the 3rd time I've had to type this since the text keeps disappearing.otal unreliability of this crappy kee your money! I HATE IT!!! I'm throwing it away . It ought to be illegal to sell something this poorly made.yboard has driven me crazy. Please don't wastThe random jumping disappearing cursor, the disappearing text and the tIF YOU BUY THIS DON'T SAY YOU WEREN'T WARNED.Patricia Ouimette"
1,cheap and expensive,You can find a much better quality wireless for $40 at Fry's electronics!!!Spread the word!
2,No right control key!!,"Emacs users should forget about this keyboard, as there is no right control key! And according to the manufacturer, there is currently no way you can customize this keyboard.update: I now found a way to re-map the delete key to right control key in ubuntu..."
1,Works for about a week and dies,The keyboard worked fine for about a week and then in the middle of the day it quit working and I haven't been able to make it work since
4,About as good as they get,"Nothing is perfect, but this wireless keyboard and touchpad combo is about as good as they get these days. It has some big pluses - lightweight, 1/2"" thin, and small enough footprint to fit into my 13"" case perfectly. There are also three minuses - Price is high, there is no cap or case for the USB insert so the contact point can get bent or dirty, and most importantly, there is a lag and inadvertent jump around the page when using MS Word. I have had this problem with other wireless units from a variety of manufacturers, so I wonder if it is more a case of RF lags. All told, I would buy this brand from Amazon again, but next time I would try a wired unit to see if it eliminates the lag and jump problem."
1,Worked for a month !,"This keyboard worked great for a month. Now its done. totally useless. What a piece of CRAP !!. GET A BRAND NAME PRODUCT. Have you ever heard of Adesso before? probably not, than do not make the mistake I did. Stay away."
4,Solid product; no sightline required,"I use this keyboard with a Wyse terminal connected to my TV. I plugged the USB receiver into the Wyse terminal and the keyboard worked perfectly the first time. Since the Wyse terminal does not run Windows, it was important to have a hardware-only product which requires no special Windows drivers or software.Keyboard does not use infrared for communication, so it does not have to be pointed toward the receiver. I can continue to keep the Wyse terminal in the cabinet and can use the keyboard in any position.Have used it as far away as 20 feet; no problems.Yes it is true that you have to hit a key or two to 'wake up' the keyboard before it will respond."
4,works as advertised!,"I got this to be able to hook my laptop computer up to my plasma tv and then use this wireless keyboard from across the room and it works just fine. I haven't put it to heavy use, but the battery saver sleep function also seems to last well with sporadic use."
2,"Dead after 1 year, 3 months...","Worked flawlessly for the first year. Just after a year a problem with the trackpad ""sticking"" as scrollbar, then the unit stopped responding completely after 1 year and 3 months. I contacted Adesso Support and they offered to repair the unit at $40/hour and offered a 90-day warranty after it gets repaired.Not good enough for a $100 product IMO."
4,Battling all kinds of slimming programs!! Great book!,"Okay... no one else is gonna read this after me, but since I've just read it I may as well put this in...People (women actually) try all kinds of things to slim down. Lois is fat, and the truth is she's not all that desperate to get slim. But her mother, the famous actress Sharon Long, is sick of being humiliated by the media of her fat daughter. Because of this, Lois has to turn to a psychiatrist, a hypnotist, a fat farm, and a gym (and some other things but I can't quite remember now).This is a story you can enjoy because of the humour and conversations. The ending was a good fantasy and although I enjoyed it it was also - to me - just fantasy, but then that's what books are about. Look for it if it's out of stock here. I found it at a bargain price at a bookstore. I hope if you read it, you'll enjoy it!"
2,Not what I expected!,"Unfortunely, there had not been any reviews before I bought this book. I would have wanted to know a little more from a former reader. I would say there is more information about slot machines on the book cover than useful information inside of it.Light reading about slot machines, but the author does not tell any of the secrets promised to be found on this pamphlet."
1,Nice but lacking in workmanship and quality,"This is a nice pocket Bible, but it is lacking in both quality and workmanship. For some reason Nelson publishers has chosen to use a questionable (CHEAP) paper in the production of this Signature Series Bible and as a result there is significant glare when read under artificial light.In addition the cover is not stitched its glued! This is unacceptable for a SS series Bible and brings into question the ethics of Thomas Nelson Publications. A quality French paper, and a stitched cover would have made this Bible worth every cent.I will return this book and never buy a Thomas Nelson Book sight unseen again."
4,Actual Dimensions - Pretty Big,"Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't understand that ""17 pounds"" isn't enough for the Dimensions field. Here are the actual dimensions.18""w x 7""h x 9-5/8""dTo give you a sense of scale, that is about 1 inch wider than most home stereo components (like your amp, receiver, or DVD player), so it'll stack, but there will be a little overhang. Just think of it as love handles for your center channel.The price and sound quality more than make up for the largish size, as long as you've got the room. Be warned, this beast isn't wall mountable."
5,awesome book for all incoming freshmen!,"This book includes great, honest insight. It's perfect for every incoming freshman who is even the least bit apprehensive to start college. I wish I had read it last year when I was a high school senior... I'd have been a lot more prepared! (Great grad gift idea)!"
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"This cd has the classic drowning pool sound and a new lead singer that makes the rock even hit harder, it is a wonderful cd, for those of you like the classic drowning pool, like i, would like the song titled ""Nothingless"" wonderfull"
3,Broken No More...,"I'm not crazy about the whole CD, but Seether featuring Amy Lee is one of the most rememerable song off the albumn. the style resembles a blend of Shinedown, 3 Doors Down, and Nickelback, but with Amy in the mix it holds a whole new characteristic to it.Definetly woth buying just for the one song :) Or you can find it on Seether's new albumn ""Disclaimer"".Awesome song!!!"
1,Bad quality!!!!,"Not only does the picture quality rate negative stars, but the plastic looks cheap. Runs on 4 AA batterys and should be called a toy and sold for $30. I bought, tested, and returned it in under 2 hours."
5,Great Envelopes,"These envelopes are great. Many reviewers listed problems with them sealing. They must have changed, because I have not had any problems. I bought these envelopes specifically so they would match a theme for a birthday party invitation that I made and have found that I love them. They stand out more than a plain white envelope and are a green product made since they are recycled. No more boring white envelopes for me. :)"
2,Golf Guard ECONOMY,"When I purchased this product, I was not expecting a spectacular golf travel case, but I was expecting something that was functional. The locks do not work, or at least the keys provided do not fit into the locks. The locks also become unlatched very easily. It is not a case for a golf traveler, but perhaps would be good ""economy"" case for the occasional traveler. On the positive side, it is the cheapest hard case that I have come across and has a lot of space."
4,Happy with purchase,"We are happy with the purchase, as this really does give the romantic flickering candle look without the worry of a flame. Makes a great gift for anyone."
4,A solid Murphy outing,"When watching an Audie Murphy western, you have to overlook his baby face and small build and remember his service to his country. You know he was tough in real life, so that makes him more believable in his western outings.Gunsmoke is a solid outing for Murphy. He moved well in a Western setting and he practiced quick drawing to the point where he could do it faster than his instructor. Therefore, no fancy editing was needed when he used his gun.The scenery alone makes this movie worth watching as Reb Kittridge, played by Murphy, goes from outlaw to cattle ranch owner and drives the herd to market to sell them in time so the mortgage on the Montana ranch can be paid.Charles Drake, a regular in Murphy movies, gives a solid performance as well, and Susan Cabot is a little sparkplug as she resists Kittridge's advances (but only for a while).The ending is suspenseful as you don't know until the very end who is loyal to who. Very recommendable."
2,issues,i think this game has a great concept and would be fun to play...if it would work properly. fist of all i had the issue of it not connecting to the internet but then i installed the patch and it worked out. but then if i play the game for more than 5 minutes it completely shuts my computer off. my computer meets all the requirements and i couldnt find anything on the internet about this problem to fix it. i tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it but it didnt work. so now i can play the game in 5 minute intervals and lose everything i was working on when it shuts off or i could try to exchange it and see if its just that cd. so if you buy this game i hope it works out for you!
1,Keep Looking!,"This book by Altoon Sultan is basically a dumbed-down version of Daniel V. Thompson, Jr.'s excellent introduction to the medium in his book The Practice of Tempera Painting. While photographs abound, they are most useful in displaying Sultan's uninspired use of hatching and cross-hatching. If your looking at acquiring this book because you are a Sultan fan, it might be just the thing to help you understand how her images are made. If you want a good instructional book on egg tempera, keep looking!"
5,The Woman Hunter/The Night They Took Miss Beautiful,"Pretty good movies, even though they are definitely ""1970's"" action.DVD was a little ""fuzzy"" at times, but considering they were probably ""made for TV"" movies, the transition to DVD was done quite well."
2,SAME OLD FEVER SORRY BIG LET DOWN,"IM REALLY SORRY TO SAY THIS BECAUSE I WAS A FEVER FANATIC BACK IN 2002 AND 03 BUT ITS THE SAME GAME WITH ONE EXCEPTION READ AND LEAD .THE COMMENTARY WILL PUT U TO SLEEP RON PITTS IS BORING AND THE SOUNDTRACK IS AWFUL AND STILL NO DYNASY MODE AND MANY OTHER IN DEPTH MODES ARE MISSING FOR THE REAL LIFE PLAYER.THE POLYGON COUNT IS THE ONLY THING HIGHER TEN ANY OTHER TITLE THS YEAR BUT IM SORRY ITS JUST MISSING SO MUCH MADDEN 04 RUINS THIS GAME COMPLETELY MICROSOFT NEEDS TO START LISTENING TO THE FEEDBACK BECAUSE IM JUST 1 IN 10,000,0000 PEOPLE TO AGREE FEVER NEEDS A MAKEOVER NOT JUST READ AND LEAD MY GOD THERE STILL DOING THE SAME STUFF SINCE 02 GUYS WAKE UP ."
1,ESPN whips Fever every day of the week and twice on Sunday,"I was a HARD CORE fever fan, I executed every line of code god knows how many times in 02 & 03, I loved it. Microsoft must have out sourced the development of 04 to intern software engineers from the University of Tijuana! This game SUCKS!!! It blew me away how ridiculous the AI, graphics, and overall game play were... Very disappointing! My money and gaming time will be spent on ESPN this year"
4,Excellent overview of Lomi Lomi massage,This is an excellent overview of Lomi Lomi. It's very easy for massage therapists to incorporate Lomi Lomi into their routine.
4,Very good.,"I liked the way this book kept the reader wondering what would happen next. The end was a surprise which is not always the case. I would have liked the book to be a little more fast paced. There were times it seemed to slow down, but would pick back up fairly quickly. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a bit of mystery and fantasy."
4,Rebuilding the world.,"Wells is one of the freshest and most talented fantasy writers working today, and I enjoyed _Wheel of the Infinite_ immensely. The City is loosely based on Angor Wat and the reader will catch whispers of Asian and Southeast Asian mythology throughout the book.Maskelle is a refreshing character in the fantasy genre-- an assertive older woman who has come into power and knows her own mind. The other characters are equally well-fleshed out with many deft and light touches that keep the tone from getting too dark.I was not completely willing to buy the ending-- a little bit too much Deus ex Machina, and that weakened the book for me. But still, it was a very good read and a commendable stand-alone fantasy novel."
4,A great REALISTIC snowboarding experience.,"I love the SSX games, but Amped 2 was a nice change of pace, offering a more conventional and realistic take on snowboarding. Pretty much all of the tricks you can do in this game can be done in real life. The graphics are great. Customization is great. Lots of expansive mtns. to explore. It is quite difficult to master. The physics are tricky to master but they are beautiful once you do. Finally the soundtrack is really aewsome offering tons of music in different generic categories. Plus, this is a great game to play with customized soundtracks. Not quite as much fun as SSX 3, but the 2nd best of its type on XBOX!"
5,Best Snowboard Videogame Ever Made . . . Period.,"So I've played every snowboard game I could find, on all different kinds of video game systems, going back to the original Cool Boarders for PS1. This is definitely the one to play!There are so many pros to this game:1. Excellent, realistic riding flow2. Great graphics (even 10 years later!)3. Nice, varied soundtrack. You rarely get sick of the music from hearing the same track over and over.4. Great in-air control of your rider. Some games just can't get this right!5. Sick trails based on real mountains and resorts.The only negative things I could say about this game, to be fair, is that the difficulty ramps up big time at the end (those challenges after you get the #1 rank are freakin' impossible!) Casual players may be put off by this. Anyone else looking for the ultimate snowboard game, stop looking now."
5,the best snowboarding game ever,"i keep my x-box hooked up just for this game! Amped 2 sets the standard for snowboard games out there! no lie, this is by far the best snowboard game ever. ssx are too fake and fast. amped 3 for 360, sucks compared to 2. Will someone please develop another realistic snowboard game like amped 2 for the newer systems please!!!! shawn whites snowboarding sucks along with every other one like it. i cant tell you enough how amazing this game is. you can take it slow in the game and ride very realistic or go fast and have fun. no fake stuff like SSX"
3,Pretty good Game,"amped 2 is the best snowboarding/snowskating game ever. However there are a few exceptions, the game is not very realistic, which means that you can do a double back flip off of a 2 foot jump or you can grind the lift cables. But there are good thing about this game too. They put buttering into the game, good for making combos and they put styling your tricks in the game which, if done right it can put 100,000 points on your score for a 720 spin! snowskating is the crappy half of the game because you can do 1 footed k-grinds and stuff like that. but if you do a back flip or frontflip you will loose your board in mid air if you dont grab it wich is cool."
3,wouldn't watch it but for backstory for the Watchmen,stand alone it isn't very good - in fact rather disturbing. But the story's impact on the characters WITHIN the Watchmen world is important
4,Great Blu-ray,"I bought this for Black Freighter and the best part of this is the Under the Hood fake documentary. If you are a watchmen fan go get this, if you are a anime fan you will love this. Ive heard that the future release of black freighter which comes with Watchmen is coming but i heard it doesnt come with the all the extras, so i suggest you buy this and Watchmen Directors cut on blu rayWatchmen (Director's Cut) (Amazon Digital Bundle + Digital Copy and BD-Live) [Blu-ray]"
5,Watchmen,"A dark, long cartoon. Not for the squimish, and those expecting high tech special effects. Recommend for those wishing to refreshing their memory in anticipation of watching the theatrical movie."
5,Awesome,I love my projector it is awesome it is so clear I would by another exact on if i needed it so worth money i spent on it 799 after mail in rebate
3,Shoddy 90's artwork,"Although the storyline is the usual high quality one would expect from Doug Moench, the artwork is appallingly bad. Jim Aparo looks like he has forgoten how to draw, Nolan looks like he is still learning to play with crayons, and all the guest artists appear to try and comepete in the `who can draw the worst' competition.What happened to the crisp, detailed artwork of the 70's and 80's from accomplished artists like Irv Novick, Gene Colan and Don Newton? This entire Batman saga looks like it could have been drawn by children with no artistic talents."
4,Just as I Suspected (while sitting in my chair stroking a cat),"Why didn't Nightwing help with this guy? Detective, can you cut the wires that are pumping this guy full of roids? Some better writers today could have done a better job...I know how it ends,so didn't get the 2nd part or whatever...I get it, it was the 90's...still decent read just to discover THE Bane"
2,Read it somewhere - don't bother buying it,"You'll want to read the story if you're a big Bat-fan, but it's not worth owning unless you're a completist. Go find a place you can read it for free and do so."
3,Okay but...,"If it's the first book you read on getting out of the job life that exists in the U.S., it's not a bad pick. The author has some interesting ideas but also leans on the book ""Your Money or Your Life,"" which I have also read and am completely enthusiastic about. YMOYL also has a more concrete plan for getting people out, so I would rate this book as okay but not the best."
1,"Not really worth the""life essence"" to purchase and read.","An infrequently interesting and short read.Not much more than a single case history of the authors experiences and exposition of social values. The book has many disclaimers to glom over the fact that the book has no real broad application to the many different situations that the reader may be in.A lot of the book is just an undetailed ""Cliff Notes"" verison of the book: ""Your Money or Your Life"". There isn't really enough information and even less new information to warrant the publication in book form.I'd be very interested to read about the success of the author 20 years from now following this financial methodolgy."
4,Great Replacement Adaptor for HP Pavillion N5250,"The very old wire to a co-worker's laptop adapter frayed all the way through recently so I googled the model number and ended up here for the lowest price. Works perfectly. Although it is not identical to the picture this is fine because the built-in ""elbow"" in the wire makes for a more durable wire than before."
3,Description is inaccurate,"This watch is well made, but overpriced for what you get. The ""crystal"" is not mineral, it is acrylic. And the hands are neither large nor luminous, as it says in the product description at Amazon.com. I would not have ordered this watch if Amazon.com or the lousy seller I bought it from would have presented an accurate description. I left a bad review for the seller, as they should know their merchandise better."
4,Voodoo Vince,got game for my grandchildren. They love it... it is not an extremely difficult game for the younger ones. The hints are great and the older grandkids help the younger. It has tunred onto a real family game that we all enjoy.
4,"Fun, fun, fun...kids loved watching me play it","First game I've bought that actually encouraged bonding between my kids and I...they loved watching me play it and clamored for ""Voodoo Vince"" quite often. Great game!"
5,A perfect end to the Deep Elm era,"I played this record for a friend, who is hardly a fan of this kind of music, while we were driving and he pulled over and stopped the car. We sat in silence until the entire EP was over..... This is an amazing record for any musician - anyone that understands what layering is - anyone that finds heartbreaking lyrics and driving guitars an unbelievably wonderful paradox - anyone that is damn sick of the radio.This record is worth the [$$] or whatever you pay... and then also worth the $7+ gas you'll pay when you decide after hearing the record that you HAVE to see them live.If you've ever believed a total stranger, believe one now. Give it a few listens before you make up your mind and then you will love this record."
5,Tears,"Man, I thought this book was amazing! I really loved and enjoyed it. I actually cried at the end of it. Don't know if it was supposed to or not, but it did. I thought it was well written and it kept my attention all the way to the end. Where I cried. Ha, ha, ha! But whoever reads this will NOT be disappointed in it. Well, at least people with half a brain. Thought it was awesome and is now on my list of my favorite books. Just to say, though, I hope another one doesn't come out. Don't get me wrong here, I just thought it left off at the most perfect spot, and a second one seven years later would kinda take away everything the first one was special about. No doubt in my mind why I gave this book five stars."
5,Excellent,The product arrived promptly and is in good condition. I am well pleased with my purchase.
1,Did not work for me.,I guess it is true that every body is different because this product surely did not work for me - not at all.
3,they are what they are,"These pops are what they are. I use them as a low sugar sweet treat. I'm not sure that they curb my hunger, but I like them. The flavor is more subtle and not too sweet. I don't like really sweet candy."
2,"Taste OK, Not Convinced About the Appetite Suppresant Properties.....","While I admit these lollipops taste pretty good, (much better that I had expected)they are marketed and sold as a weight loss aid so they should do more than just taste good. I mean, if I simply wanted a good tasting lollipop I could buy a case of Dum Dums for a fraction of the price. The instructions say to drink an 8oz glass of water before eating the pop the ""activate the ingredients"" and an 8oz glass of water after to ""flush the ingredients through your system"". Who wants to eat after just downing 16oz of water, lollipop or no lollipop? Uhhhhh......do you think maybe those 16 ounces of water have a little more to do with filling you up & reducing your hunger than that lollipop? My guess would be, probaby so!"
2,Literary Criticism,"Don't buy this book, unless you are heavily interested in literary theory, linguistics and/or semiotics. This is not a history book nor a book on history, but rather a linguistic and literary interpretation of some accounts of the conquest of America. Further, the book is biased. It does not discuss the truth of the matters asserted in the early conquest accounts and there is barely any criticism and analysis of the reliability of those sources. Get instead a Prescott if you want to know what the conquest was all about."
1,Avoid,"This set blew up after one week. Samsung refused to send a repair person, claiming it could be repaired over the phone. Huh? I called their service center and they put me on hold for 15 minutes before I finally hung up. Amazon sent a shipper to pick the set up and credit my account. Amazon thumbs up, Samsung thumbs down. Picture quality was never great on the Samsung, look to the Panasonics instead."
3,Not true 720p,"Just FYI, 720p is defined as 1280x720 pixels. And this set does not meet this standard, so it's not true 720p."
5,Great Characters!,"Having always been the shortest one in all my classes for just about ""forever,"" I could readily identify with the main character Michael Jordan as he enters middle school, the shortest one in his class. I loved all the characters--especially Michael's homeroom teacher Mrs. Preston and her insightful comments in response to Michael's journaling. A positive message and a delightful read!"
1,German Settlements,I have never received this item. I am anxious to see it but it has never arrived.
3,OK book but gathers dust mostly,I don't really like this book. The Guide to Gas Pump Restoration is much better. I wore out my edition 1 and had to buy edition 2.
1,Executive Chef would not use this board,"We love bamboo cutting boards and we have found them, as a rule, to be superior to other woods. This board, despite the lovely striping of light and dark woods, came with multiple splits in the surface, at the joins of the 2 colors, and also in the blood groove. Visual inspection suggested poor workmanship and we will not re-order from this vendor."
2,no CD with 16th edition :( and still black & white ??,"1) still printed in black and white. Modern printing practices no longer drive the need to have this in black & white. The only thing I can assume is that all the scans are in black and white, and there would be a humoungous task to rescan all the notes in color, if they could even get ahold of all the notes. Google ""banknote update"" for a perfect example of what should be expected.2) they gave us the CD with the entire SCWPM as a PDF in previous versions, but no longer? I guess that's what happens when cost cutting measures take over. At least give me the choice to buy both together. I'm not even sure if I buy the separate $19.00 DVD that it will be updated with the 16th edition, since the picture that comes up when ordering it is the 15th edition."
2,Lots of good advice but poorly organized,"The book is filled with plenty useful advice but it is so poorly organized that its potential effectiveness is marginalized. I had hoped to learn some key strategies and tools to use in a converstation. However, I spent most of my time trying to understand how each little tidbit of advice fit into the bigger picture of actually starting and controlling a conversation. Somewhere amongst all the advise are the key elements to becoming a better communicator but its left to the reader to assemble them into a practical guide to conversation."
5,Great book if you need it,Sorry I had to buy this BUT I didn't have it in time to ward off a very dangerous Man .But I will know better NOW
5,Extremely handy little tool!,"I read lots of positive and negative reviews before buying the HipShot. I think it absolutely performs as advertised, and I've found it reliable and very, very useful. This is NOT a production tool. It's for small building and repair projects and, when used appropriately, is excellent. True, the battery doesn't last for long, but since you have a spare to work with, that's never been a problem for me. The convenience is just fantastic. I've used it to shoot brads for gluing up in the shop, resolve punchlist trim problems on jobs, install small amount of trim in my own house, repair trellis' in my garden....the list goes on and on. This is a tool I wouldn't be without."
3,Three & a half Stars,"Would be a poor choice without the second battery. I have yet to keep track of exactly how many ""shots"" I get from one charge with an 18 gauge nailer but it is not very many. While working on a project I am continually swapping batteries. If I was working any faster I would need a 110v compressor. I am currently working ""inside"" with close access to 110v so I have to carry two items (Hipshot + gun)instead of just one with a regular compressor. If I did not have easy access to 110v then I may give the unit another star for portability.I bought the Hipshot to keep costs down and it WILL ""get the job done"". Time will tell (other projects) if I should have ponied up for a regular 110v compressor."
1,these toddlers songs are not very entertaining,"I wanted to buy some toddler cd's for the car to sing along with my 16 month old, althou I did listen to a couple to the tracks on website first, I didn't realise how many were going to be sung by a group of children, this makes it very difficult to understand the words and to be honest my toddler can't understand the words either, I wouldn't recommend this item."
2,Redundant Material -Word processed mostly from a few Sources,"Little in this book casts any light on the ""Science of Measurment"". In reality it is an endless list of definitions of words and terminolgy, the vast majority of which can be found in any good dictionary. This work tells you that an ""Ocean-(is) a huge geographical mass of salt water"" (pg 191). Whoa, be still my heart. That's informative.The author(s) lifted definitions from the English dictionary, a medical dictionary, and the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics for most of the text. The remaining entries are definitions of totally unimportant achaic terms."
3,"Fun, but . . .","""A measure of Everything"" is a sort of encyclopedia of measurement units, but with many other definitions thrown in, without much rhyme or reason: the arpent is defined but the vara not, the Roche Limit defined but Chandrasekhar's not addressed, and transcendental numbers mentioned but not defined. And it is organized rather haphazardly into sections that are not subdivided alphabetically. No matter, the index takes care of that.More to the point there are some technical errors:* the illustration of the vernier (p. 38) shows it reading 5.5 mm, not 5.1* the calendrists (p. 86) did not ADD 146,000 days every 400 years* an excess of electrons (p. 104) is a negative (notpositive) charge.It is enthralling browsing, but not dependable as a reference work."
1,Dumb,"If you like raving paranoid conspiracy theories, this one might be for you. It seemed poorly researched with big gaps in logic to me. Not enough plot to be science fiction, not enough facts to be journalism. Doesn't hold a candle to Tom Wolfe's _The Right Stuff_, which it is obviously (but unsuccessfully) trying to emulate."
2,A little disappointed..... . . . . . . . . . . . .,"I purchased this book because I was interested in learning how to build a working (transmitting and receiving) radio from basic components that I could obtain from around my house or at Radio Shack. I wasn't able to complete the whole book due to the fact that it seemed like a twelve-year-old had written it. Who knows, maybe I'm spoiled with other authors' writing styles, but it was just a very hard book to comprehend. Don't get me wrong or anything, most of the words were simple in and of themselves. Mostly, I was disgusted with the poor sentance structure, redundant as well as needless descriptions, and absolute vagueness of most of the teachings. I not only found the book ABSOLUTELY boring, but I had to read almost EVERY paragraph twice in order to effectively extract the information. Needless to say, I promptly returned the book and obtained a full refund."
3,all over the place...,this cd has some gems on it... but there are just too many people doing too many different things and the cd just comes out a jumbled mess... but if your willing to sort through the mess i'm pretty sure there's something for everyone on this album... there are four songs that i absolutely love and probably four others that i absolutely can't stand... the rest are just decent... so basically i would still reccommend buying this album just don't expect it to be one of those cd's you're going to want to listen to start to finish...
4,folk music,"Love this CD. I bought it just after seeing Havens in concert in Chicago. He was amazing live, and I just had to have one of his CDs. Even my kids enjoy his music on this CD.Karen"
5,Beautiful watch!!,This watch is worth buying. Perfect for daily wear to work!! I loved the design vey much. I am wearing it everyday and get compliments very often:)
5,No more fumbling or frustration,"This stylus makes it easy for a grandma with arthritis in her hands to manage her Kindle Fire very easily. Angry Birds is no challenge now. However, until this stylus came into the game, I had a hard time entering my e-mail address or selecting the small categories in some apps. This has made using my Kindle Fire easy and enjoyable. Great product."
4,superb musical version of the Oscar Wilde masterpiece!,"ERNEST IN LOVE is a musical adaptation of Oscar Wilde's classic comedy-of-manners THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST. The score, written by Lee Pockriss and Anne Croswell (who also wrote the score to Vivien Leigh's Broadway show TOVARICH) is bright bouncy and very enjoyable.The show opened off-Broadway at the Gramercy Arts Theatre, before moving to the Cherry Lane Theatre. It shuttered after a dismal 111 performances. The cast is superb: it includes Leila Martin as Gwendolen, John Irving as Jack Worthing, Gerrianne Raphael as Cecily Cardew, Louis Edmonds as Algernon Moncrieff and Sara Seegar as the fearsome Lady Bracknell.There are several gems in the score, including ""The Hat"", ""A Handbag is Not a Proper Mother"" where Lady Bracknell denounces Jack's proposal to Gwendolen, and ""Wicked Man"", where Cecily imagines the man of her dreams.This splendid cast album has been crisply remastered by DRG, and I highly recommend it to all show music collectors."
4,A Good Read!,"John Bryan Starr presents an overview of China, including its geography, history, political system, economy, and social-cultural system. His excellent, in-depth analysis discusses various Chinese institutions and issues, including the military, the educational system, urban and rural problems, population growth, environment degradation, human rights, culture, and intellectual freedom. However, you should view this book as a background introduction, since most of its information dates from research completed by 1995. For the latest developments in China, refer to more current sources. The book, which is written directly and clearly without academic jargon, is directed primarily toward westerners, particularly in the United States. We recommend this book to executives in companies that are expanding into China or negotiating with Chinese business leaders, or to anyone who wants a background of solid information about China."
1,Absolutely not yaoi,"This book is absolutely not yaoi, so I don't know why DMP and amazon list it as that. There's ONE part about two men in alley, but that's it. The rest of the book is about a boring cafe and how it helps people's lives. And a lot of information on pastries. There's no romance and there's nothing fun at all."
1,All these CD'S are defected,Do not buy this CD. There's a defect with this CD for example his most popular and best song via con me is the 3rd song on this CD NOT. In other words the song that is there is not Via con me but Donna.
1,Not for me!,Why in God's name Amazon made a recommendation that I would like this is beyond me! I have never given any indication in anything that I purchased (159 different items) that would give that indication. Hated it!
5,Makes me joyful!,Living in the Northwest the days are gray and long. This CD lifts me up and gives me energy I found Paolo Conte from the movie A Good Year.
1,ARCO sells name. Teacher products ripoff.,"ARCO claims to be the number one NAME in study guides. Maybe the last twenty years in business lets you sell your name. The demographics of college educated teachers wants quality. The NAME is the strength but the price is a ripoff for getting twenty five sample questions in any of the multiple subject tests. Why do I care what is on 20 different subject areas? I only want the one I take. They think they make you feel confident that you will ""score high"" without giving any content to review. Four years 25 questions? The only reason I gave it a 2 and not a one is because I give students credit for at least looking for help. The professional knowledge section is the best part. Again it lacks content. Some people may want to learn by reading the answer key. Better stuff is out there"
5,Great Hard Bop Quintet Session!,"This features Thad Jones on the flugelhorn with Pepper Adams, one of the great baritone sax players, making a really potent combination for this session. The rhythm section consists of Duke Pearson on piano, Ron Carter on bass, and the drummer Mel Lewis (maybe the start of their long association).The harmony created by the two horns is very appealing as well as their solo work. Most of the tunes are in a medium tempo groove which includes a very upbeat arrangement of ""Wives And Lovers"". The set concludes with a very funky version, including tack piano, of ""Yes Sir, That's My Baby""......the first and last minute being a rather satirical approach to the music style of the twenties.This cd will appeal to those who like a tightly knit group that explores the tonal possibilities existing with the combination of flugelhorn and baritone sax, hard bop fans, or fans of these particular musicians. Really good medium tempo session that's good listening!"
2,Not for Me,These were so narrow I had to send them back even though I ordered a larger size they just didn't work for me
4,4 to complete 5 and 6,Bought 4 to complete 5 & 6.Playing them in iTunes from OP 4 through OP 5 en OP 6 is a great experience.Very well choice of tunes !It gets you in the right mood.Life = chill = enjoy.
1,Not what I expected,"Ok, got this product in hopes that I could capture some video footage from my Sony Digital 8 handycam. After purchasing the software, found out that I needed to get a capture card to make it work.Afterwards, I looked at the editing features. Basically, how you take the video is how your video is basically going to look. The features are rather poor, and the ""special"" editing tools are near non-existent. All this program really does is create menus, add your video, and allows for special stuff (ie outtakes, alternate endings etc.) that you can add in. It does not allow you to edit your video files like adding a fade or transition stuff.I just ordered Screenblast Movie Studio. Hopefully that will be better for me. As for DVD X Maker...was not what I was looking for."
1,What is this?,"What the hell is this? This is nothing like the other Splinter Cell games. Can't believe I wasted $8 on it. I mean, I was so excited to get this and have fun, because I played the first Splinter Cell on GameCube when I was a kid, so I was excited to relive my childhood through another game. This is bull crap though. The game is horrible. It just throws you in and doesn't tell you how to use the controls, or what your objective is. Speaking of the controls, there are to many, and they are clunky and sensitive. Do not buy this game if you are a fan of the Splinter Cell series, this one is just bad."
1,NOt a good game,"I am a huge fan of Tom Clancy's games. I love Ghost Recon, and Rainbow Six series. However, this is my first time playing Splinter Cell. This is a total waste of money, and honestly I am not impressed by the graphics. Maybe this is a game for those who love strategy, but for me is a boring game. So far for the Xbox 360 only Ghost Recon 3 has lived up to its expectations.For the people who love co-op games, I highly recommend ""Conflict Global Terror"". It's a game for Xbox but the gameplay is outstanding!"
4,very fun and challenging,game is pretty amazing. takes a lot of strategy to complete the game perfectly on the hardest difficulty. gives you the perspective of choice and critical decision making about the long term effects of the game.
4,The Institute Will Be Heard From Today,"This short monograph focuses on VMI's more well-known alumni who served in the American Civil War. It includes information often overlooked in the more comprehensive histories. It is a compelling read. I only wish it had contained more information on the junior officers and enlisted men, not just the field grade and general officers. Highly recommended."
4,Helpful Reminders,"I received this book as a gift for my first pregnancy but never used it. This time I feel the need to be more organized, do more planning and feel that I am more prepared.I know that most expectant mothers who purchase pregnancy organizers and journals are first-time mothers. If you are not a first-time parent, don't overlook the value of an planner. I am home with a toddler and my husband travels regularly for business. There is just no way I would be prepared with all my questions and information for appointments without an organizer like this."
2,Misleading,"I searched under ""Pregnancy Journals"" and this came up. However, this is NOT a pregnancy journal. While it does have a lot of useful information in it, it was not was I was expecting. This is not a journal to write how you're feeling while you are carrying your baby and document all of the interesting things you go through while pregnant. I was very disappointed. However, if you are looking for an informative book where you can keep information about your doctor, then this is the book for you."
3,it is okay,"I have had this for about 4 years now & I never really got into this product. I have sleep on it for a week or so, then took it off. put it back on, then off again. I had to take it off completly when my wife was pregnant because it made the bed too high & kept sticking her with the feathers. It is noisy too. I sleep on it resently before a move all my things to my new place because it was better than sleeping on the floor when the air went out on my air mattress. it is hard to was and takes days to dry. it is ok, I guess."
1,no touchpad drivers,"The touchpad was my primary reason for getting a keyboard. I am switching to a tethered computer, from laptops, for the first time in 8-9 years, and have long ago come to prefer touchpads to mice.This touchpad, unfortunately, comes with no drivers. Upon emailing Adesso tech support, I found out that this model is strictly ""plug and play"" - in other words, whatever mouse controls exist in Windows are all you get. They ""may put out a driver next year"" (quoting Adesso).Being used to much more extensive touchpad control, mostly through Synaptics, this was too much of a backward step for me. This keyboard has to go back. Adesso has pretty much the most extensive keyboard/touchpad lineup, most of which come with Glidepoint drivers, so Adesso it will be - but not this one. Not with nothing more than Windows mouse support."
1,Dreadful,"I've tried to stick with this dreadful keyboard, but I just can't any longer. Pointer/cursor moves around on it's own, deletes text, etc. Don't buy."
4,Geared for High School,This book is a good resource but I was expecting more ready to go pages for $30.00. If you have a group a criitical thinkers this will work for you. If you have lower level learners the activities won't be an introduction to the literature that is covered.
5,Simply Usable,Bill has done it again. Wonderful read and a must have to cut through the clutter and to make process more usable.
4,Slakes Limbo,Slakes Limbo is a good story about a 13 year old boy who is a lives by himself on the streets. The kids he goes to school with chase him and beat him up. One day they chase him down into the subway. He decides to stay there and live for 121 days. While he is down there he finds a cave in the wall were he makes his home. Soon he started sellling newspapers and making money. With the money he makes selling newspapers he buys food and soon gets a job for free meals.Slakes Limbo was a good book about survival and it was interesting on how he made money. He also made good use of some unusual things that he collected in the subway. I would reccommend this book to anyone who likes a survival story.
3,Home-less Run-away,I thought the book was ok. Iy was very weird though.Like Slake actually liked and wanted to be homeless. I do think kids should read the book because it teaches them more about life. But he lead a life that not many people I know would like to have.But it's good to know what he does in the end.
5,Worth the price!,"I was preparing myself for an awful taste because of some of the other reviews, but they were dead wrong! I prepared this by heating it up to extract the nutrients and strain the fiber (can cause gas), and drink it like a tea and it reminds me of those packets of chicken noodle soup flavoring. Very good!"
3,NOT QUITE AS IT APPEARS.,IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS THREE CD SET IS OF LIVE RADIO BROADCASTS POSSIBLY FROM THE 40'S OR 50'S. THE SOUND QUALITY IS VARIABLE AND CONSISTENT WITH OLD RADIO BROADCASTS.THERE IS NO INFORMATION SUPPLIED WITH THE CD SET EXCEPT THE NAME OF THE SONGS. THE CD SET WAS MADE IN PORTUGAL. HOWEVER GIVEN THE LOW COST AND FACT THAT THESE ARE UNIQUE RECORDINGS 0F GREAT SONGS IT'S PROBABLY WORTH BUYING.
2,Not accurate,"I bought the entire box set for my husband when I became pregnant with our first baby. This particular book was a waste of time, my husband said he read more for a laugh. Each chapter describes milestones for each month, and they are so inaccurate! Our joke is that by month 12, the author would suggest that baby should be driving. New dads should just follow along with the What to Expect the First Year instead."
2,Not for AP fathers,"This book does not support the principles of Attachment Parenting at all. If this is the only book a father reads he may consider ""a feeling that enough is enough; your partner's breasts have been partially offlimits for almost a year; it is time to unlatch the baby"" a good reason to wean your baby. Also it condones letting baby cry it out and doesn't offer any of the positive benefits of the family bed. It just wouldn't work for my family."
5,The best RPG you may never have heard of,"This is one of the best RPGs to date - period. Part of the appeal is that few have heard of it and even fewer have played it, but there's plenty of appeal beyond that. The epic-scale land and sea battles are a treat. The characters are intelligent and memorable. The plot is comfortable but full of surprises. All in all if you like classic-style RPGs, you'd be a fool not to get this game. My only setback is how androgynous the main character is. As setbacks go, that's hardly a deal-breaker. Buy this game."
2,Sent Wrong Color and not leather.,The item does not assemble well and is not leather. I ordered it brown and they sent me black. The overall quality is not that great. I would have rather paid more and gotten leather. I also think that they should note that it is synthetic.
5,Folk Bruce with a Stupendous sing-a-long crowd,"Bruce and the history of music. Unlike anything else I've ever heard him record, in timbre, range, effect and crowd-sing-a-long."
2,Sinking Down,"Bruce continues on his road to irrelevance. The further he gets away from his roots, New Jersey, etc. the less he is worth spending time with. He seems to want to be the bard of the new left, to take residence in pretention row. Come back to Wildewood!"
1,This was a complete waste of money,"Short and to the point review here, after using it for seven months and only getting more gray hair, the only thing it did was drain my wallet. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
4,Midwestern Catholic ism meets Chinese Culture,"Although a little rough in the first chapter, The Celibate Ladies' Man settles down into an engaging, suspenseful, mystery interwoven with an eclectic mix of personality, practice and trivia from midwestern Catholicism and Chinese culture. Although there are intricately woven threads, the plot is straightforward, e.g., no confusing flashbacks. It is not gory, however the plot does hinge on several acts of violence."
3,Not his best ... but you'll always learn something ...,"Reckoning is not Buckley's best (I liked Elvis in the morning much more), but as a quasi history buff, I always enjoy reading about what transpired both before and after WWII, especially in Europe. As a classical music lover, I very much enjoyed Buckley's use of classical music (and some mentions of some of my favorites--Mahler mostly) to engage me as a reader (so add a half star to that--amazon doesn't let me).Otherwise it's pretty predictable, what will/does happen, but there's always something to ""learn"" from reading anything Buckley (so long as you can ignore some of the obvious antagonism toward the Soviets) and that is always a plus for this reader. And, quite frankly, he was once again (as in ""Elvis"") amazingly fair regarding alternative political views to his own."
2,Superficial,"I felt like I was reading an outline. At the close of the book, I knew as much about the characters and what made them tick as I did on the first page. Mr. Buckley knows how to string words together but very little about plotting and character development. The entire reading experience was eerily remote."
1,worthless,"A novel of worthless sentimentality that succeeds relating historically to the Nuremberg ""trials"" only through a great deal of name-dropping."
1,I Threw my imaginext set in the garbage too!,I purchase a couple of imaginext castle sets...only to be too frustrated putting them together and like the other reviewers claim imaginext falls apart very easily. My sets were in a scrambled pile of pieces just collecting dust in my son's room. I checked ebay for selling a used set but they had no resale value so I just threw the imaginext sets in the trash. Now I have more space.
4,Good local knowledge overview,"If you take the time to read the introduction to this book, you'll find that the editor put together an experienced team of writers for this (first) edition of Best Places Las Vegas, many of whom are Las Vegas natives or almost so. Too often, guidebooks are written by people who fly into a place for four to six weeks, learn as much as they can (which is not much) and then bang out a book based on that and a little follow up research. Not so with this book; truly, it reads almost more valuable for a resident than a visitor, as most visitors are tourists who are looking for guides on how to be a tourist, not insider information. Mr. Reza has also written and edited for Time Out Guides, a series I adore and trust, so I think it's better to take into consideration that while the writing styles (of all the authors) found in this book may not be YOUR style, the information is accurate from a local perspective!"
2,"well, at least buster williams and jerry dodgion are on it","my roommate is a bass player, and he used this album as comic relief. i felt like i was listening to the opening credits of a 60's ""laugh hour"" type show. Hey Ron, Herb Alpert called...he wants his sheet music back."
1,Awesome Movie - Rubbish DVD,"I love this film, so I decided to get the DVD. Since getting it on the shops is impossible I had to order it. Absolute rubbish !!!!- It comes on full screen format cutting the original framing- It promises a booklet, no booklet- Poor quality packagingThis product is highly overpriced for what it has offer."
4,"Dark, passionate, funny...","Most enjoyable. Though consistently dark, it evokes strong feelings. The poetry is fabulous and the imagery compelling."
4,"Perfect size, big power","Of all the drills out there this one is a steal at 119.00. Being a home owner most of my projects take 2 or 3 hours. This drill packs enough power and run time to do the job. Backed by the Dewalt name this drill is perfect, 1 hour charge time too."
4,A good drill/driver with a shifty problem,"I recently received the DEWALT DC727KA drill/driver kit. I have always been happy with my DEWALT purchases. A corded 3/8"" drill I bought years ago is still working beautifully. And I'm pleased for the most part with the new drill/driver. However, I think there are two minor weaknesses in its design. First, the switch located near the thumb (I'm left handed) for switching between forward and reverse isn't well thought out. It should have been designed to protrude a bit further from the drill's chassis to make the shifting easier and more positive. As it is, it's too easy NOT to push it far enough when switching directions. Secondly, the chuck loosens up unless you really cinch it down, and even then will work loose. Finally the manual is worthless and should be more specific in directions.DEWALT DC727KA Heavy-Duty 12-Volt Ni-Cad Cordless 3/8-Inch Drill/Driver Kit"
4,A must for historical data.,Good book which goes through the badkground of the firearm. Details changes with dates which helps when you are trying to authenticate and date your own collection or individual piece. A great reference book.
1,Canyon Annoying,"This CD is arguably the most annoying music I have ever heard. Winter is trying to sound different, but ends up only sounding BAD. A better name for this CD would be ""Songs of the American Elk in Estrus"", because this is what many of the cuts sound like. Beware: Listen to all of the music before you buy, and save your money."
2,Not Impressive,"One of the main weaknesses of this work is that it does not adequately separate the narratives according to their gospel of origin and, therefore, neglects the redactional contribution of each writer. The analysis is limited and not nearly daring enough."
4,"Overall, satisfied with the product.",Everything was fine but one of the holder's didn't have a top for it. However I never contacted the company to have them to send me a new one so I can't really complain. But overall I really enjoy this product.
3,Chapters varies in quality,"A must buy for pathologists interested in hempath... since books in this topics are so scanty. Other well written books (e.g. Contemporary issue series) were outdated.Chapters varies. Some are detail and well written (e.g. follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, immunohistochemical analysis of lymphoid tissue) while other are disappointing (peripheral T-cell lymphoma, application of molecular genetics (chap 9)).Some contents overlap between chapters.Pictures are suboptimal, can't imagine still using black & white image nowaday.Suggest split into 2 volumes: lymphomas and leukemias"
4,Another Day on Earth,"One of his bests with Ambient 1, music for airports. Great mix between electronics and sing. Very nice!"
1,Cheap Seat,My 3 Month old son loves bouncy seats we have four of them so when I found this one I couldn't wait to buy it. I thought it would be great with 3 vib setting and many learning settings with a magic mirror. Boy was I ever dissapointed the vol setting is way too low and the magic mirror is a joke. Every time I put my son in it he cries!!! Stick with fisher-price!!!!
2,Frustrated,"The common-denominator in all of the gems was that they were written well. The grammar, punctuation, spelling, capitalization and format were correct. The stories themselves might have had giant holes and would fall apart from poor foreshadowing or illogic, but time and again we'd contract these works because we could sort out the problems and see the story as a whole because we weren't continually stopped, annoyed and frustrated by the simple problem of poor mechanics. I believe the author of this book has probable, impending ability, but the poor mechanics will hinder and frustrate most readers. I go further here, I'm not sure the poor mechanics are the writers fault!"
5,It Works!,I just ordered my second bottle of this product. My 11 year old Shih Tzu was getting constant bladder infections. Since being on UT /Strength STAT she has had no further infections. I'm very pleased with this product.
4,A good introduction to futures and more,"Those who have listened to Jim Rogers speak in the past few years will find no real surprises in this book. He likes commodities, and he likes china. He is not quite so fond of india and dislikes russia. You only have to go back to his previous book adventure capitalist to get that message, where he went into much detail about the problems with both india and the central asian states and their particular brand of outlaw capitalism.So the message to buy commodities is not new in this book, but in this book he gives you some basic information on commodites, nothing new here. In the middle of the book, however, he breaks the commodities down, and makes an individual case for each of them, based on fundamentals and history. This, in my opinion, is the strength of the book and what makes it worth the price."
4,Commodities have a place in your portfolio,"This is a nice book by Jim Rogers. I have seen him on TV numerous time and generally liked what he was talking. Once he made a great comment on FOX channel, he takes the trades only when he kind of sees money lying on the floor. In other words, he goes for sure bets. Now there is nothing like a sure thing in investment but still, a reasonable due diligece goes a long way...His book does try to convince you that commodities movement will not be over by the time you join them! He indicates that these cycles run for years, because creating additional supplies, new mines take- time.I would recommend for those trying to diversify their portfolio."
1,Jim at its best and its worst,"Everyone praises Jim Rogers. And despite that the general trend of what he says is correct, he is very often wrong. For example, i remember when he said in 1986 that there will never be another Democratic President ever again, because the party will self-destruct itself. He was also very negative on Russia, only to see Russian ETFs charge higher and higher. If you truly want to learn how to trade and time the markets in commodities, you should consider buying the books of Linda Raschke and Toby Crabel. They trade for a living and currently run successful hedge funds. Their writings are almost out of print at this point, but you may be able to find it on Ebay or Amazon."
3,Still Valid After All These Years?,"While Rogers is an indisputable master of markets, this material is dated. The view from pre-crisis has yet to be proven in our current situation."
1,BOOOORRRRRIIIIINNNNNGGGGG,Enough said. I read the first chapter - closed the book and will sell it on Ebay.
1,And we're reading this because&#65533;?,"It's an Oprah book, but not a good one. Cliché after cliché after cliché: divorced woman lost in the world, left by a husband who never loved her; a son bordering on adolescence whom she doesn't understand; a kind stranger opens her heart up. Please, give me something new and different. And then in the last 20 pages, nothing but dramatic event after dramatic event. Where was the drama through the first 200 pages? A quick, uninteresting, and unsatisfying read. She should take notes from Wally Lamb."
3,"Liked this book, BUT","I really liked some elements of this book. It took me deep into my own past when I went through a divorce, so I could really relate. But I thought some of the characters needed to be developed in more detail. I would recommend Open House to some of my friends, but not as highly as some other books I've read recently. I would highly recommend HINDSIGHT by Elizabeth Rae Monroe and A MAP OF THE WORLD by Jane Hamilton."
3,"A funny, often silly read about a silly woman","I did enjoy parts of this book. Some of Sam's observations about her husband/men are right on. I also found some of this book as really silly and improbable. The main character, Sam, is very frustrating. Why didn't she try to go to school and become more independent? Why did she spend a lot of money on really silly things when she was concerned about the mortgage? I wasn't too thrilled with her new choice in a romantic interest, either. And you know, she would have jumped at the chance to reconcile! I was a little disappointed in this book."
4,The right buttons.....,Elizabeth Berg has pushed all the right buttons. Intricate descriptions of mother and childen relationships. Beautifully written.
4,"Good, quick read","I have read some of Berg's other novels, and this was not her best. However, this was an interesting look at a woman's struggle to rebuild her life. The ending is no big surprise, as our a lot of the events in the story, but it holds your interest and I am glad that I have read it."
2,Oprah's Poor Choice,"I bought this book while waiting at the airport for my flight to depart. I was looking for an easy read and I got it. While reading this book wasn't a challenge, getting into it was. Her main character, Sam, is pathetic and flat. Sam's epiphany (or, as I prefer, Berg's ""pat ending"") occurs in the last chapter. Until that point, Chapter One is rewritten as Chapter Two, and then Chapter Two is rewritten as Chapter Three, etc. Skip this book. The most interesting part of it is the jacket copy."
1,Pah-lease!!,"This is another book about the ""poor woman"" scorned! It is trite, predictable and sappy. It is the perfect book for women who self-pity themselves after a divorce in which they probably contributed. (Did I mention the the main character has a child (son), too many bills and bad luck? How original.)"
5,they sound like guns n roses,i dont know guys but i think they sound a lil like GNR esp. the guitar player. i love gnr and knowing that they will never be back together sucks but this band right here brought back the spirit to me . long live ROCK!!!!!!!!!
5,Silvertide brings it all back,"This is a great preview to the upcoming album. Silvertide rocks out old-school, with an upbeat sound and smooth, flowing lyrics.01. Mary Jane02. Beware03. To See Where I Hide""Mary Jane"" is probably the best track on this EP, Silvertide rocks out with amazing vocals. Every track has a similar sound to it, but when you hear each one, there are still definite distinctions. ""Beware"" is intense, and it makes you want to locate your nearest mosh pit and go crazy. ""To See Where I Hide"" tones it down just a little bit, but barely. The whole CD is great--definitely wait for the album release to get the full experience. These guys may never get famous, but they'll be going places nonetheless."
3,Slogging through history,"I'm afraid I'll have to disagree with the other reviewers. While Safire is certainly to be commended for his scholarship his prose is as wooden as the sword used to mock Spittin' Matt Lyon. There are so many elements of a good story here but Safire rarely makes them come alive. He also feels it necessary to repeat facts again and again, especially the history of Maria Lewis Reynolds Clingman Clement (with all or most of her names) every time she enters a scene. It's a period in history that I find interesting so I stuck it out to the end but I had the feeling I had read something that was good for me rather than something that was good."
4,Engrossing fiction on early American press,"This was my first historical novel ever and - despite the denseness of Safire's writing which requires complete attention - found it a great read. At first, I thought that it was going to be largely about the Hamilton sex scandal with Clinton parallels, but was pleasantly surprised that it delved more into early American journalism (via privately-published ""pamphlets"") that were hardly subjective. Safire could have even made this more colorful, with less emphasis on the political machinations of the characters. Still, it was a great intro to historical fiction, and made me want to read Safire ""Freedom,"" in which he writes about Lincoln."
4,be warned,"While this book is carefully -- even elegantly -- written, be aware that your enjoyment of it (or even your ability to follow it) will be seriously impaired if you lack a strong background in the Founding Fathers.For those who know a good deal about America's early years, about the Constitutional Convention, about Jefferson, Hamilton, Adams, etc., this book will bring their knowledge to life in invigorating and engrossing ways.For those who only know nearly nothing (or only some broad facts about this time), this book is likely to prove dense and unrewarding.So study up first. Safire doesn't give you a primer. It's for readers who are already ""into"" the era."
5,QUATTRO FORMAGGI enhanced CD a MUST-HAVE for DOGSTAR fans!,"This is an enhanced CD which means there is video footage as well as 4 songs. Songs on this CD are: ""Honesty Anyway"", ""Behind Her"", ""Return"" and ""32 Stories"". Video footage includes performances/concert footage of all 4 selections as well as conversations among band members (KEANU REEVES, BRET DOMROSE, ROB MAILHOUSE). For those fans new to DOGSTAR or not so new, getting a chance to see their performances makes this CD a must-have. (Finding all the video clips is fun, too!) As for the music, these songs could be categorized as alternative rock, I suppose, but I would call them full-bodied and soulful. The music is coupled perfectly with Bret's haunting voice."
1,Where's the 0 star rating?,"I tried watching this DVD with a friend last weekend and, almost an hour into it, we decided to eject the disc and go to bed -- and it was only 6 pm!!! We were neither tired, neither in the mood for romance, we were simply bored to tears by this movie with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Even Kathy Griffin couldn't save this yawnfest.I wonder if the pawn shop would give me anything for the plastic case, as the DVD itself isn't worth crap!Do yourself a favor and buy Kathy Griffin's ""Allegedly"" DVD, instead."
4,The Truth about a Relationship,"The Wages of Sin is a rousing book for anyone who wishes to take a journey into the lives of two couples who are forced to deal with the ugly truth about their relationship. Dr. Forrest-Carter's book exemplifies the downs in relationships and shows that no matter how much we want things to work out, sometimes they don't. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to examine real life issues on an intellectual level."
3,"Worth owning, but not front of the pack","This collection is remarkable for the range of songs it makes available. In fact, once you get past some of the Dubliner's top hits, the music is great. I'm disappointed in their performance of a few standards, such as Whiskey in the Jar, Seven Drunken Nights, and Nancy Whiskey. The performances are not nuanced, they serve too much as drinking songs and do not dig down into the soul of the music. And the compliation repeats titles in ""live versions"" that add nothing to their depth. The biggest exception to this pattern, however, is the rendition of Black Velvet Band. However! There's a lot of other great music here. The instrumentals are fine, if not inspired. And many of the lesser known titles are great additions to anyone's collection of Irish music. So I'd recommend doing what I've done. Buy it! Certainly! And then upload into iTunes and leave off the titles you don't like when you move the music over to your iPod."
2,"Good Idea, Bad Programming","The idea of the game is great, but there are conflicts within the programming that causes it to crash constantly, even with an updated computer. If you check the maker's site, they have many reports of the same problem. The Idea is great, the graphics are good, just wish the game would actually work. You have to download a patch to even attempt to get it to work. Check out ASCARONS FORUM on their web site--Would I buy it again? No. I would hesitate at buying any software from ASCARON."
3,good concept,"Conceptually good game, but in practice you spend more time setting up industries to support your sailing adventures. Ascaron states you can choose path of Bucaneer or Trader, but the adventures do not pay enough to subsist solely on the high seas. Sea battles are entertaining, but you cannot control choice of ammunition or direction of your vessel at times. The most challenging problem is a reputation; it takes very little to damage it and a whole lot to boost it. The return in terms of price for goods and ships is almost not even worth caring. The price fluctuations are excellent and prevent cash cow trading.Concept: 4/5 (whats not to like about pirates)Graphics: 3/5 (no 3D battle scenes)Entertainment: 3/5 (the map and cities are ALWAYS the same)Speed: 1/5 slow to become interestingOverall: 3/5"
1,no lo compren,"No mal gasten su dinero, hay un senor hablando al empezar de cada cancion, con excepto de 3 canciones, el senor te volvera loco de lo estupido que se oye el cd cuando el habla. No se quien estubo acargo de este producto, pero si yo fuera lupe, los demandaria, que verguenza que arruinen el repertorio de canciones tan buenas de bronco, mejor compren amigo bronco, su mejor disco. jmag in pa"
4,A vastly improved and enhanced second edition,"If you currently work in computer forensics or are considering a career in this exciting field, buy this book!The collection of forensic tools and material on the CD-ROM alone makes the book worth the purchase price."
2,Huge Disappointment: Little-to-No Technical Content,"The first 250 or so pages provide a decent (at best) high-level description of Computer Forensics, but the next 300 pages have little to do with computer crime investigations. It seems as if this book should really be two books: the first book would provide a good overview of computer forensics for those who are not very technical, and the second book (larger book) would be on Information Warfare. If you are looking for a decent book on forensic computing, with a lot of technical meat, this is NOT your book."
5,How to catch a thief.,"The second edition of this comprehensive text details how to analyze and conduct a forensic examination which will lead to identifying and prosecuting data thieves. This book provides examples, case studies and check lists to aid in the learning process. In addition, a CD-ROM provides forensic software tools and documentation. This text is especially beneficial to law enforcement professionals or anyone responsible for data security."
1,Extremely boring,"I love to read, and tried hard to read this one. It has its interesting points, but the book just seems to ramble. The best word I could think of to describe it is ""boring""."
2,too boring,"While I'd agree with the previous reviewers that the book contains bits of useful information on Mexican customs, I just couldn't bring myself to finish it. The style is humorless, politically correct, and almost entirely based on generalizations. To give you a taster of what you will encounter once and again, here is a quote:""Like the peasants of China, whom the late Mao Zedong, founder of the People's Republic, compared to grass which is repeatedly mowed down only to spring up again, the poor peasant farmers of Mexico have been a permanent part of the rural landscape."""
1,Hoover refurb floor cleaner,Upon recieot of this unit I washed a floor When completed the floor was straky and less than clean looking Upon the second attempt days later the product worked well on part of the floor and than just ceased adding water though the container was half full and aqfter putting some water and cleaner on the floor the decice aqlso did not vacuum it up I am quite disappointed i will try one more time
4,One of those guys,who has the ability to play anything and make you respect it and him. This guy is a thinking musician. I'm listening to it now respecting the drummer Lex Humphries too.
5,"Off all the soundtrack to dicontinue, why pick this one?","I had a copy of this a few years back and of the 70 cds i've had go missing, i miss this one the most. (The vocal tracks i burned on to another cd, and i still thank the fates for it) This cd is the Boss, with mellow tracks for relaxing and high energy traks for having fun. it also has some cool spoken word traks that convey the story of the series, But if you don't understand Japanese, you're out of luck. For the most part, the tracks are in the order they play in the show, with some exceptions at the end(Most notably Tear Attack)This is a crowning gloy for any anime colection"
5,cd review,ALL I CAN SAY ISIT'S GREAT! THE BEST POP FESTIVAL COLLECTION I'VE SEN IN A WHILE! IT WAS DELIVERED IN TIMELY FASHION AND IN GOOD TIME! I WILL DO BUSINESS FROM AGAIN IN THE FUTURE! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
4,very good cd for a true fan,if your a true fan of mr mansons work youll love this cd.it has a lot of his songs from marilyn manson and the spooky kids and as the cd progresses you can notice manson getting less and less nervous and the dvd that comes along with this cd is good to it has three of their songs live and you can see how much manson has evolved in the years this is definetly gona be in my cd player for a while but i only recomend it to the true manson fan if your only an ocasional manson listener than this probally isnt for you.cant wait until the next spooky kids collection comes out!
3,Cash in,"There are a few decent tracks here, you can hear where some bits were used on future songs. Otherwise, Manson had a reason why most of these songs got tossed- they suck. However, the sound quality wasn't bad. The DVD was merely songs off the cd synced to the video. Watch half way closely and you'll hear a bass line going and the bassist on the video is standing idle with his hands nowhere near the strings! It was good for heckling purposes. I'm a big Manson fan and bought this just to have it as part of the collection. I think Berkowitz was just trying to cash in."
5,More than meets the eye...,"This seemingly unassuming book is full of treasures to be discovered. David Hein's biography of Noble Cilley Powell, Episcopal Bishop of the diocese of Maryland from 1943 to 1963, presents so much more than an exact account of the life and works of a well-known and beloved Episcopal bishop. Hein's insightful and clear writing style is very effective at depicting the circumstances of the times in which Bishop Powell lived and how these shaped his character and his actions. The author also has been able to illustrate, through the testimonies of those who knew Bishop Powell at different stages of his life, how his noble and nurturing character influenced others inside and outside the church. But, for me the highest value of this biography is how Hein masterfully brought forth the connecting thread of Bishop Powell's life: a life signaled by love and friendship through Christ's love, or what Powell referred to as ""love in action""."
5,"Outstanding New Product, I highly recommend it for parenting","I just bought ""Baby Brain Basics Parent Kit: Birth to 12 Months"" and we love it. We did not know by the product photograph listed on your Amazon website (listed under new books) that this produc features five (5) great items inside this wonderful Parent Kit which contains: 144 page parent guide book for birth to 12 months old; 32 page toy buying guide; soft-covered baby photo rhyming book complete with 8 fun-filled rhyming cards; 20 track Music CD featuring World & Classical music.All of these fab items represent a fantastic value. Not only did I get a good value for my money, the ""Baby Brain Basics Parent Kit: Birth to 12 Months is an ideal purchase for parents, grandparents and gift-givers alike.I highly recommend this new book/product as an ideal maternity gift for all expectant mothers."
4,Lots of suction,"It's a great vacuum. The cup is easy to empty. The vacuum does a great job of cleaning and really picks up a lot. It is self-propelled, thus easy to push. My only complaint is that there is no switch to turn of the beater bar especially when using the accessories."
1,A waste of money...,"Shipment received in great condition, well packed, no damage.Five of those received were of the wrong grit.These bands fly apart under minimal usage.I have used 10 of them so far to do the work of one manufactured by Dremel.No bargain in this product."
4,Definitely worth reading,"I highly recommend this book if you are a reader that's interested in exploring the various themes that are the constant undercurrent of human history and civilization. No, this book will not predict what will happen over the next 100 years in minute detail. If that's what you're looking for, then by all means, call the psychic hotline. But the idea of history being cyclical is sound, and in this reader's humble opinion, common sense. Technological advances aside, history has proven rather conclusively that human beings remain basically the same. And I believe these authors are, in their scholarly way, simply reminding us of that. ""The more things change, the more things stay the same"" is demonstrated to be true in the book. And although I don't think that this theory, or any other theory is without error, I do believe that the authors ideas are definetly worth considering as we enter a new millenium."
3,Thought provoking concept provides excuses for bad behavior.,"The examination of cyclical shifts in attitude and values within our society is of benefit. If Strauss and Howe are correct about a new Civic-minded generation coming of age who will place societal good ahead of selfishness and moral chaos, then they have offered us hope.Unfortunately, this book celebrates the chaotic destruction of family, of duty, of responsibility to others and God equally with the building up of virtue. In the authors' eyes, the evil which we have witnessed in the past 35 years is a necessary and acceptable part of cyclical change. The public may well have to witness foul behavior before becoming willing to take action and move in the opposite direction however, I strongly disagree that acceptance of such behavior is appropriate.END"
1,Try Tarot cards,"This is just another Nostradamic prophecy. It may have social ramifications listed, but a few of them are bound to be right no matter what happens. After all, if you asked a 100 people to guess your number between 1 and 10, about 10 of them would get it right. This is a kooky, neurotic theory of predictable future that strongly rings of some of the economic cycle prediction wonks of the 1970s. Millions of people have made prophecies...almost all of them have come out to be wrong. I heard one of the authors on the Art Bell show and there is definitely a very flaky, new-agey undercurrent to this whole thing. I should also add that there are a lot of other prophecies too in this book that turned out dead wrong. Try Tarot cards instead...after all, out of the whole pack, there are bound to be a few cards that accurately correspond."
2,historical astrology,"a horrid mix consisting of one part historical riffing, one part astrology, and one part interesting correlation of data patterns. The combined effect is little more than a condescending attempt at palm reading.That being said, some of the predictions were spot on but ultimately the suggestions as to how to deal with the looming catastrophe has us all being good little docile unquestioning citizens. It's sad that people take this tripe seriously.I would suggest the book 'Worldchanging: A User's Guide for the 21st Century' instead for some real-world solutions to real-world problems."
2,Boring,Many people have tried to make a theory of history. All failed. It interesting that although many people have seen cyclic patterns in history. Everyone seem to have different times.Unless you really know your American history you are going it hard to get though this book. I found that some of the historical facts used to justify the theory pretty weak. For example to claim that the sinking of the Lusitania in world war 1 was as much a reason to go to war as Pearl Harbor in world war 2.
5,Brilliant,Great thought and facts. This is a read for history minded and forward thinking people. History does truly repeat itself
2,Not a worthy book -- move on,"The Fourth Turning, by William Strauss and Neil Howe, is a theoretical if somewhat dubious explanation of era changes based on generations. It predicts that America is set to enter the next ""turning"" in 2005, which will be one of disaster. If you're looking for info about Sept. 11, 2001, this is not what it's about. May be some good reading, may interest some, but those who were expecting a non-generational event like 911 will be disappointed."
4,A Different Sort of Book,"I have never before read a well reasoned sociological study, much less one that ventures bold predictions about the future. I found this one riveting -- and the 12 years since it was originally published, the predictions have proven remarkably prescient. I am convinced that we are now going through the sort of crisis where the world we will see coming out of it will surely not resemble what we saw going in. I hope our leaders rise to ther challenge."
3,CAUTION: May cause epileptic seizure.,The filming is nauseating. The music is fantastic. I just wish it was as watchable as it is listenable.
5,Great digestion helper,If you want an alternative to manage your stomach acid levels this DGL product is worth the money. Easy to take and no unpleasant taste to deal with. Just swallow with a little water.
2,???,I bought this because of dgl on it and in capsule form. But when I got it...it is only on the side of the name and does say it has some of the ingredient that will raise blood pressure. So..I emailed and asked about this and they did not know if it did. Then I called the company and they told me to ask someone else. They did not know about their own product?? Wont take it now.
3,Required Reading,Book was required for the research class I was taking. It is very cut and dry. Drink lots of coffee to stay awake while reading this book. Amazon had the best price over the other competition.
2,be smart keep looking,"This is the book that was selected for our research ""introduction"" class. If the authors wrote this book with the intentions of it being useful as an introduction on the topic, then they missed the mark. You will know the same amount of information before you read the book as after you read the book. The authors forgot who their audience was. SAD because the book is really expensive."
4,Low cost arrows,"These arrows are a good deal compared to other offers i have seen. The notches are red plastic, but most are plastic these days. Otherwise,I use them for target practice and they fullfill their purpose."
4,Great for little golfers,I gave these to my 2 and 4 year old grandsons and they loved them. I liked them because they were not too big and bulky and they fit nicely into the bag. It also includes a cup to practice putting.
4,Is that Pantera?,"Often times these fellows (on this particular record) will remind me of the golden-age of Pantera... ""The Great Southern Trendkill"" and ""Vulgar Display of Power"", maybe a little ""Cowboys From Hell"".Give the previews a listen, then buy this if you're a fan of thrash-styled metal with semi-clean vocals."
5,Great Review & Insights,"These notes provided an excellent comprehensive refresher. I would never recommend anyone read these instead of the book (but you could probably get away with it). Reminded me of events in the narrative that had slipped my mind, and the analysis of themes and characters gave me insights that I did not pick up on my own."
2,BAD!,"This book started out boring, picked up the pace a little bit, but then in about the seventh or eigth chapter it got really boring again. DO NOT waste your money on buying this book"
4,Rally Madness,"This game is WAY more fast-paced than it's contemporaries like ""Sega Revo Rally"", but I find that the handling of the vehicles is a bit messy. Granted it IS a Rally Race, but still...If you happen to be an avid Rally Car fan, then this game is for you.Graphics: 8/10Sound: 6/10Realisim: 9/10Overall Game Satisfation: 7.5H A P P Y G A M I N G ! ! !"
1,Poor quality live recording,"Back in the 1970's I bought one of GCS' original albums. BEAUTIFUL blue grass music! I was terribly disappointed by this CD. Poor quality performance recorded at a live concert. A silly rendition of Janis Joplin's ""Mercedes Benz"". A ludicrous ""I Am The Earth"" song that was probably ghosted by Al ""Ban the Automobile"" Gore, great song if you are a radical member of Earth First. If you believe in a little development in the name of paying your bills and advancing the living standard of your children, then it is a left wing turnoff. The back cover shows GCS in middle age. Not only have they not grown professionally, the quality of the sound in this CD is a mere shadow of their original music. If I could return this CD to Amazon for a refund, I would. I may even spend my money and send it to GCS to let them know that I was sorely disappointed."
5,great design,"Beautiful Design by Tolleson out of San Francisco. They do wonderful graphic design work. Check out their book ""Wash, Soak, Rinse, Spin: Tolleson Design"" for more of their style work. There is nothing better than a book that is designed to match the content. Format, type selection, imagery, is all top notch. I highly recommend just for the design itself."
1,hear the confused lady speak,"If you are interested in a authentic picture of the woman (without the benefit of class-conscious ghost-writers) you can turn to this site, where there is an interview with the Virginia, recorded on National Radio New Zealand: radio dot 50g dot com You will hear a VERY confused lady, saying absolutely nothing at all. Its all woffle to justify vulgar capitalism."
3,breadmaker paddle,These teflon-coated paddles don't last very long til the teflon starts bubbling and pealing off. I wish they had a stainless steel option.
1,This paddle does not fit my Breadman TR444,The paddle appears to be the same as my original but it does not fit. The diameter seems to be OK. The flat used as a key way seems to be a bit too big to accommodate the flat on the drive shaft in the bread mixer bowl.
5,breadman's paddle,"Okay, I admit it I still use the Breadman to make my bread, It's old, but still works. When I lost the paddle I was so upset that to think I would have to throw it away. But wait, there is Amazon, maybe they would have the paddle. Wait for it, wait for it: yes, they have it! Only took a few days to get it, (it was a third party), and now I can get back to baking bread again. Thank you Amazon."
2,Possibly the wrong item shipped,It's possible that a cheaper item was actually shipped to us; the cover we got was simple plastic -- no evidence of 'glass' or weave anywhere. It has not held up very well since each arrow cuts a nice round hole in the plastic.
1,A cheap and antisemitic passion play,"Is this art, propaganda, both, or neither?It's propaganda.It accepts as a fact that rich and greedy Jews stole from poor but noble Arabs and continue to oppress Arabs so much that criminal acts against the Jews are a logical consequence. However, the actual history of the region has been quite the opposite of all this.Neither side is presented fairly.Now, does a work of art have to have anything to do with truth or fairness? No. But right now, the most significant attack on human rights by the international community is against the rights of Israeli Jews. That makes this work a serious element of propaganda in favor of more violence in the region.Some may say that this work has been heavily criticized by people on all sides of the Arab-Israeli conflict. But that certainly does not mean that it is any good!"
1,Courtney Love and her book of lies. . .,"I had the chance to review this on the internet before buying. Thankfully I did. I would not recommend this book to anyone who really gave anything for Kurt Cobain and or Nirvana. The book is inaccurate and follows a form known as Courtney Love and her book of lies. She helped write this book and who knows what is true and what is not. My opinion is to try Love and Death or Who killed Kurt Cobain or for that matter, try Tom Grant's Investigation manual. Written by someone other than Ms. Courtney Love herself."
4,kurt was the Man,i just wanted to say that kurt is my idol and he his the reason i play guitar. he is a great inspiration and i do not think that he really killed himself acually i KNOW he didnt kill himself he was mudered and anybody who would kill such a great icon should go to hell(courtney love)anyways anybody who cares to learn anything about kurt cobain should get this book.
1,Nothing New,"This book is a cheap imitation of a book I found after I bought this one (""Letter of the Week"" by the MAILBOX). It has very few reproducibles, and most of the ideas do not give many details. For example, for Letter A it says ""Learn about animals, antelope, alligators, and anteaters.""If you are looking for a book to make your life easier, this is not it."
3,"Disappointing, but okay overall","I recently purchased this CD based soley on the Amazon description and customer reviews. Amazon's description claims that this CD contains ""20 original songs."" That is not true. The CD I received has only a total of twelve songs on it-- only 60% of what its description claimed it would have. Thus I feel both disappointed and gypped. That being said, I don't hate the CD, but neither do I love it. Overall I think it is okay. It has a running time of thirty minutes and some of the songs have fun sound effects. The music is often upbeat, even if the lyrics are not. But had I been able to preview this CD prior to purchase, I would not have bought it.I much prefer the Family Circus/Complete Lyric Language French CD, which also has some sound effects, and has twenty-one fun, bilingual songs that run seventy minutes. I also like the Universe of Song, French, which is bilingual and runs about an hour"
1,Uncle Carl gives the 'formula',"I rented this book from the library and very dissapointed. All the book contains is the same formula we've seen in countless ""controversial"" books. Even the cover is pretentious enough to indicate the contents are inflammatory or shocking, when in reality all Uncle Carl does is repeat various establishment platitudes about ""hate"".He does not describe any ""coming race war"" but instead picks out several divergent groups and attacks them as ""hate"" groups, always conforming to the established media in his assumptions. He has the nerve to accuse the Hon Rev Farrakhan as being a ""hater"" (of course, good ol' Uncle Carl' is quite the lover!) but he never has the nerve or ability to back up his calumny.In addition to the lack of content, Uncle Carl seems to write at a 4-th grade accusatory level, even more infantile than normal. 1 star for trite, redundant prose, and lack of any original content."
3,"Cheap phone, way outdated","This is a real cheap phone, however, you get what you pay for.It is very good with battery capacity though, lasts for a week or so.Other than that, it is very outdated, hard to use. You'd be much better off with getting a cheap phone from a prepaid company."
2,The most basic of business information,"If you are a complete business novice, this may be useful. I was hoping to have a reference guide for my bookshelf so I can look up issues that I may face as a small-business owner. But I felt the topics covered were shallow and uninformative. I returned the book."
2,Didn't work for me...,I have Great blue herons and Egrets visit my dock. Lots of poop. This did a little but not enough to remove all of it.
1,Pure Propaganda called Documentary,"Instead of providing a realistic understanding of how the Arab world encouraged Gaza to become a haven and training ground for terrorism, this film is merely twisted propaganda that justifies continuing terrorism against innocent Israeli civilians. It is just another vehicle to promote hatred, prejudice and anti-semitism. This film should not be shown to students of any age."
4,Victims of the Israeli occupation,"I highly recommend it to be watched using the producer's comments, it gives a good understanding where and why the scenes are taken. This movie expresses the real struggle of the Gazian people."
3,Shorter than expected...,"James Longley did a wonderful job in revealing the truth about Gaza. I appreciated the two versions..subtitled and then narrated. I advise that you first watch the subtitled version first..although annoying to read, makes more sense to watch in this order. The narrated version is more or less a summary of the subtitled. Also, the film is a bit shorter than what I had hoped for. The film is only 74 minutes ..not even a full hour and a half. Hoped for at least two hours being that Longley did spend three months and ""acquired nearly 75 hours of footage"", seems a bit stingy that we only get 74 minutes. Overall..I recommend that you purchase and add to your collection.."
3,Large is just too small,"I was looking for a small, lightweight fin for snorkeling that I could take traveling with me. These look like they would work great.These fins weigh 40oz per pair and the large size measures 15"" x 9""They arrived today and after trying them on they are just too small for my size 10-10.5 feet. I ordered the large and it is too narrow and squeezes my feet. The heel straps are also out to their biggest position.Unfortunately I'm going to have to return them."
1,The Worst!,"I am an avid reader of biographies, mostly about actors, and I can honestly say this is the least well written book I have read in a long time. The writer seems to have absolutely no point of view and bascically serves as listing very uninteresting facts about a subject that from other sources, I gather was a complicated man. I forced myself to finish the book but found it very tedious. It was almost as if the writer went out of his way to report mundane facts about James Dean. I realize this sounds rather harsh but I am still in shock at how boring this biography was."
1,Doesn't have audio tape/cd,"Just as my title states, this product does not come with audio support. Other than being deceived, the book was in a good condition."
3,Don't expect chips...,"If you are expecting chips, then do not buy this set of smoker chips...its like sawdust. It worked but definitely not what we expected when we opened the package. It was used up quickly in a regular smoker so not sure it was worth the money."
4,"great western spy movie,1st rate","A Army Major gets striped of his rank and thrown out of the Army,kicked out of Garrison by his pears and Comerads alike.When the Major clears his name(Garry Cooper)he reviels the rear Croock and brings him to justice.Great western good Actors,good director,they dont make movies like this anymore"
1,Bogus Guarantee,"The Tripp Lite device burned out my router immediately and filled the air with acrid smoke. If it had been used in conjunction with my Pioneer Elite television, I'd be shedding tears BECAUSE Tripp Lite has a $100,000 guarantee that if their device shorts out any adjoining electronics they will refund the cost of the damaged products. When I returned the USB to Tripp Lite, I received a letter that their engineers found nothing wrong with their product although it smelled like toxic waste. They plainly lied to save the refund of a $100 router. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. (Once again, the seller was upright. It was the actual company Tripp Lite that were the louses.)"
1,Poop Off pooped,"This stuff was an absolute failure. The poop in question was from Fish Hawks. It was about 2-3 weeks old. I had tried to remove the stuff with Soft Scrub, and then Mother's wheel wash for brake dust. I followed the Poop Off directions to the letter and then some, and it failed to remove the stains. It did nothing in fact. The Mother's wheel wash was much more effective (although that didn't remove the stains either). I wrote Poop Off to tell them their product didn't work and heard nothing back. No surprise. Another internet ripoff."
4,good book,i enjoyed it. it was a great history lesson regarding the harlem renaissance and described what a rent party was all about to me.
3,Coleman fliplid 6 cooler AMAZON,"This purchase was a mistake.....I lost my old Coleman Lil Oscar cooler and bought this one.....I did nt realize how small it is! Perhaps a bottle of water and a sandwich it will fit! I feel like an idiot! Would not repeat a purchase like this at such a high price. Go to Walmart,,,,iT IS MADE cheaper than the old style as well.....ice melts fast!"
2,Ineffective,"I bought this product with hopes of a more enjoyable way to expand my vocabulary. I tried to like this product (especially since it's a good chunk of money) and I gave it a fair amount of my time. In the end, I found it to be ineffective for these reasons:- The script is boring. It tries to be witty, but really comes of as cheesy/corny- I found myself constantly rewinding. The material just doesn't sink in. The stories and dialogue aren't memorable. Perhaps this is so because of the pace. I'd rather have fewer words and actually learn those words, than sweep through many words and have to backtrack. I'd say on average the amount of time spent listening to the material was TRIPLED because of rewinding.- The voices are a bit stuffy and robotic to meIn the end I stopped listening to Word Smart. It was just too laborious."
5,"Excelente cámara, magníficas fotos y sorprendentes funciones","Esta es una excelente cámara digital automática.1 La óptica de Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar Lens es excelente, inigualable, felicitaciones a Sony por la alianza.2 La resolución de 5 MP es más que suficiente para las fotos familiares.3 El tamaño es muy conveniente, ya que cabe en cualquier parte3 Los videos con sonido son espectaculares4 La función de visión nocturna y el holograma láser son sorprendentes para una cámara tan pequeña y de gran utilidad.5 Las baterías son muy duraderas6 Algunas críticas que no le quitan méritos: el encuadre a través del visor es ligeramente más pequeño que el real visto por la pantalla de la cámara; las fotografías son numeradas en orden sucesivo y no incluyen la fecha en la numeración.En pocas palabras: Excelente"
3,Poor Auto White Balance ( Blue Cast),"The Phil Askey / dpreview.com review of the Sony Cybershot DSC-V1 concludes that the camera's auto white balance is ""poor"" in ""outdoors indirect sunlight"" conditions. I decided not to buy this camera."
5,Stories from Spain,"This is an excellent book for someone who speaks a little Spanish, but is not comfortable with fluent conversations. It has one short story in Spanish on one page and then in English on the next, so you can always check yourself, or read it in English, if you prefer. You get to see the verbs conjugated properly and can learn some of the phrases. The stories are interesting and help to make you a little more cultured. I definitely recommend this book."
2,Very small and convenient,"I liked its tiny Size, Shape as well as the features (Display, Quality and price)Cons: Battery charging, Noise when we tune FM."
4,Great Point & Shoot Camera!,"I bought this camera recently at 360 bucks. It¡s a bang for the bucks, with 5 megapixels. Batteries are good. The Nimh batteries the camera came with have shooting life up to 50 pictures, to fill up a 128-MB memory stick. Since it¡s AA, you can get cheap batteries anywhere in stores.The body is plastic, but thick and firm, though not as delicate as I thought it to be. Noise of zoom lens is a little annoying. Low-light focusing is always a trouble.Pictures shot in daylight outdoor are superb. When I printed one on Canon photo paper pro on 4x6 size, you cannot tell the difference from pictures shot with films."
5,Sony Cyber-Shot Digital Still Camera - DSC-P92,"Well, I have to say, this is the most wonderful camera I have used. I have always loved the pictures that my sister's camera takes (Olympus). Her camera was very expensive and this one was quite affordable and takes as good of pictures if not better than hers. I have not a complaint about this camera except for the memory stick that comes with it. The pictures are crisp and clear! I love it! Thank you Sony!"
3,No Black & White mode,"I had a 3.2MP Sony camera about two years ago. It was great. Why I got rid of it, I'll never know. Even though it was a bit bulkier than the DSCP92, it took great photos and MPEGs and I could fit so much on a 128MB memory stick. With this one, five photos and a 30-second MPEG are all I can fit on a 16MB memory stick. But what bothers me most is that it doesn't offer Black & White as an optional photo mode! WHY IS THAT? It's such a common option and yields some beautiful photos. I mean, come on, how often do you take photos in Sepia, Solarize or--what's the other one--Sunburst? PLEASE! I'm tempted to take this camera back. Even my parents' cheap Kodak digital camera offers B&W."
4,"Good product, but there's something wrong with amazon...","First of all, I compared this camera with the Sony's P10, and they have basically the exact same specs, the only noticable differents is the design, P10 has a 16MB more capacity on the included Memory Stick, but for a price that is more than $50. I bought this camera and bought a Sony 128MB Memory Stick for $50 bucks.What I don't understand what amazon is doing is that I had one item in my shopping cart for 10 minutes at one moment, and the price had increased. Also amazon.com prices of most of their products are actually higher than their other retailer listed on amazon.com web site.What mystified me also is when I make an order, the order doesn't show up until like the next day, and when its about to shop, it does the same thing. What's going on with amazon?????"
2,STELLA LUNA,BOOK WAS IN FAIR CONDITION.HAD 2 MISSING PAGES AND TORN COVER WITH MAGIC MARKER SCRIBBLING OUT SOMEONES NAME. WAS DISAPOINTED IN QUALITY CONSIDERING SHIPPING CHARGE
5,Kids love it - Watched it over and over,My kids loved this movie!(and book) They want to watch it over and over. They really enjoy the part where a teacher comes on a teaches about real bats at the end too. They have learned all these new facts about bats and they are only 3 and 4. I rarely buy DVD but this one is worth it.
5,Stellaluna,"I got this for my grandkids. The story line sounded good to me. After watching, the kids gave it 5 stars!"
3,Golden Ecstasy by Wanda Owen,"Nothing could match Andrea's rage when Gil thoroughly kissed her full trembling lips. She was of his enemy's family, but they were forever enslaved by their precious GOLDEN ECSTASY."
3,Not the best choice,"Some classics are great - Woody Allen, Mike Nichols...but all in alll this is not the New Yorker at its funniest - or is it just that the editor's sense of humor differs from mine? Well, considering that lately all the fiction in the magazine seems to be written by the same author, editor's choice makes a difference."
2,Who is that guy?,"Disappointing. Unfortunately while these do sound like the original recordings of Rigo Tovar and his Costa Azul, they have added a voiceover that constantly interrupts each track with tacky poetry or a mock conversation between a couple (who are these people?). The song I bought the cd for (Palabritas) is hard to find - on this cd, not only is it interrupted at the beginning by this voice, but is not even allowed to end before the voice cuts in again and another song begins. Terrible!"
2,Undisclosed information!,"This group did not disclose that this book had been a library book. It had stickers on the cover and a clear cover glued to the book. I purchased this as a gift. Used is fine, covered in stickers is NOT!."
1,Terrible Customer Service,This camera worked well for a few months and then the LCD screen broke. It was not dropped or handled roughly. When we took it to the Sony authorized dealer he wanted [money] to fix it. When I called the Sony Customer Service they said that was the correct price and there was nothing else I could do. Do not buy Sony products. They are built to be cheap throw-away cameras!
4,"Good, but sometimes a bit slim on material",I liked the way this textbook is put together; it is clear and well structured. The only flaw is that it is sometimes a bit light on some topics
1,Buyer Beware! It's only 13 pages!,"Buyer Beware. [price] for a total of 13 pages. This ""BH SmartDoc"" is a magazine article being sold with books, sold in the same format as a book, costing as much as a book, and it's a mere 13 pages long (12 actually, the last page is devoted to selling other SmartDoc's). It's informative and well written but there's nothing much new about change management and certainly not worth [the price]. Skip it."
1,Long Journey Of Gracia Mendes,"I read and write several articles on history. Certain time frames ect. This book was very poorly written. Not in the grammatical way, but from a historic point of view. The amount of Jews living in Spain at this was very underestimated. Inside this book with in the first two chapters there are many inaccurate historical quotations. Sadly I do not recommend this book to anyone it could be a waste of your time."
4,Unbiased and unconditional,This piece gives a glimpse of people getting past their biased beliefs into a place of unconditional love based on intelligent reflection.
1,WAY OVER PRICED,"Martin recurve X200 is an excellent bow. Martin retail price is $319.00, I was able to find it on the internet for 229.00 plus shipping for a total of $245.00. What I have seen with Cannon Sports so far seems to be way over priced on almost all items."
2,Poor quality DVD,"Compared the the other version of this film on Amazon (the Tamil uncut special edition, or the other version that is 2-DVDs), this is a poor DVD. First of all, it is a dub. And a poor one at that. Even if you can't speak Tamil, its nice when the mouth movements match the voice. This doesn't happen in this DVD. Second, this is a DVD-5. It is highly compressed and doesn't look good. If you have a small TV, it might not matter for you. Anyway, I was disappointed with this DVD, so I took a chance on the other one which cost $5 more, but it was worth the different. Just my $.02. The movie itself is great. They could have cut out about 20 minutes of the non-action, but its a fantastic film nevertheless. Highly recommended movie - just not this DVD."
2,Compact but disppointed,I bought this camera P10 this last December.The following is the review about this camera.Pro:(1) Compact(2) Battery charger charges the battery very quick ( less than 2hr)(3) Navigation menu is very easy ( no need to go thru the manual)Cons:(1) Shutter speed is unreasonably slow ( difficult to catch candid moment - especially required fast speed shutter). Yesterday I tried to catch some candid moment about my daughter's basketball practice. I caught the shoots but the focused object was not in the center of the picture . Very disappointed.(2) Zoom is not powerful enough - all the pictures are blurred if the focused object is more than 20 feet away. It is almost impossible to take shoot for the basket ball game if you are in the audience seat.
4,Only lacks 2 options I would like to have,"It's a great all around camera from what i have used. The only thing it lacks is a black and white picture taking mode (it gives you 3; sepia, neg. art, and solarize.) I would find the black and white feature much more useful. One other thing is the zoom in the 5 mega pixel you only have 3x optical zoom instead of using 4x smart zoom. I am also having some trouble with the differance of opinions of the length of the memory in the movie mode and how long it can record with what memory stick. The camera says 90 min with the 128 stick but consumers say differantly. Who is correct?? Don't get me wrong I love the camera and would recomend it to anyone that is listening!"
2,Purchase something else....,"I've had my sony camera for over a year. I first bought it because with a 256MB chip I could get an 11 Minute movie that I could transfer to VHS. For the price I paid at the time $499, I should have bought a video camera. In my opinion the camera it's self really isn't anything to write home about. The lens is junk, my pictures always are pixelated. Compare a Sony picture with an Olympus, Minolta, or Canon, even with a lower amount of Megapixels the quality will beat sony at the highest setting. And if you reduce the Megapixels with Sony the images just degrades and the shutter speed is horrible. If a person moves slitely there is a blur. My choice after seeing and talking to friends is 1) Minolta 2) Olympus 3)Canon ... though the Canon is getting better and better with their newer rechargable battery. Anything else other than these is pretty much a gamble I wouldn't take..."
5,A great product!,"Just got this camera a few weeks ago and had the chance to use it at family gatherings over 4th of July weekend.....no complaints at all! Compact, easy to use, good-looking, and most of all takes great pictures! Getting a 5-megapixel camera for the same price as most other manufacturers' 4 MP models is a huge advantage! The movie mode is also lots of fun. It's also super easy to transfer pics to the computer, just USB and go! As with the other Sony products I own, this camera draws oohs and aahs whenever I take it out! All in all a great deal for the camera, although one might want to invest in a 128 MB memory stick and extra battery for vacations and longer picture taking events when downloading to a PC is not readily available. Pick it up!"
3,"Love it, but not perfect at all","I love this fountain, but it has 3 major drawbacks:1) The top section, or ewer, is made of a different material than the rest of the fountain, so it doesn't match. Its made of smoother, darker clay.2) This does NOT come with an AC power pack, so can only be functional when the sun is shining.3) The chord is about 8 feet long, so it's too short to have the fountain at a nice location and the solar panel hidden in a sunny area, like your roof.Otherwise, it makes a soothing amount of noise, is pretty and is fairly stable. Very easy to put together. Unfortunately, I don't know how to get an AC power adapter for it (weird connector), so it's useless a lot of the time."
4,"Celine, The Gibb Brothers: The Gibb Brothers, Celine.","Sometimes, a song can definitely surprise you when it has the chemistry to match with it. Although Celine Dion had that in the power of her own hand with My Heart Will Go On from Titanic, there were much better waiting in the wings, and The Bee Gees wrote one of them. The song Immortality, was released as a hit overseas, and not in the U.S. Arguably, the song has a lot more meaning and a sense of realism than My Heart Will Go On did, and is one of the last Songs The Bee Gees wrote for another artist, before Maurice Gibb's death in 2003. It remains as my favorite song from Celine Dion's 1997 Let's Talk About Love record, and still remains as a heart-grabbing ballad worth the listen."
1,Horrible to do business with,If I had known from the get go that these people don't sell their own stuff I would have never done business with them. I purchased cologne from them going by the picture on the listing. Instead what I got was what they wanted to send me. I tried three times to call and speak with someone about getting what I DID order and not what they chose to send me with no success. They refused to let me speak with a supervisor. Their customer service people were very evasive and vague about the whole thing. (Lisa especially) What I did get was a continual excuse and not once did anyone offer to resolve the issue or make it right.I am saddened because now I am left with a fragrance that I don't like and no resolution. Shame on you ANTonline.
3,left me twisting..,This is my 2nd Joe Ely cd after LETTER TO LAREDO. I have to admit it just hasn't grown on me. I love his music and I'll give it a few more spins but when I want to listen to Joe Ely I always grab LETTER TO LAREDO. I love his music and will buy another cd maybe someone can suggest something that matches LETTER.
2,"Not worthy of ""Joe Ely"" designation","This is a pretty poor Joe Ely album. I have seven of his albums (not counting this one) so I do consider myself a rabid Joe Ely fan. This CD however did almost nothing for me. If you want to check out some Joe Ely, I would recommend starting with ""Lord of the Highway"", or if you like live albums try ""Live at Liberty Lunch"". ""Dig All Night"" is pretty good too, especially if you like music better than lyrics; sonically that album is my favorite by Joe Ely."
2,Trying to find a book,"I know this is not the usual review you may expect. the point is that I really want to read this book, but I also need a specific book concerning with the use Shakespeare made of the Chronicles. As I haven't seen any e-mail to address someone to ask for it, I thought someone could help me via the review to find a book called the Chronicles of Holinshed and its use in Shakespeare's plays, or something very similar as I really know the title in spanish. This book was edited in 1927 by E.P.Dutton & Co. in New York. the reason I am looking for this book lies on my doctoral thesis on Shakespeare. I should be very grateful if anyone could help me to find this book via internet. my address is barbican@teleline.es & my name is Salvador Montaner."
5,Good product!,My preferred choice for my more heavier days. The tampons are less uncomfortable and painful to insert then their plastic counterparts and the fact that they're inexpensive doesn't hurt either. I highly recommend this product!
3,Lackluster third entry,"Although Tecmo outdid themselves in terms of beautiful graphics and stunningly horrifying spirits, I found the storyline confusing and not all that engrossing.I liked the return of Miko Hinasaki, heroine of the original Fatal Frame, (she's not the main character, but the assistant to the protagonist, Rei Kurosawa, but you can play as her for a while), and how this entry tries to tie all three games together, but I think it fell short of succeeding.The opening tutorial was rather annoying, as you are equipped with a standard camera that cannot harm spirits, leaving you forced to run whenever they attack, which is often enough to adversely effect your game health. The new controls aren't as easy as the first or second entry, but I suppose you can fix that yourself.This entry mildly repeats themes and spirits from the first and second game, and adds ones that make this entry truely scary.Overall, a somewhat disappointing entry in the series, but not terrible. Mildly entertaining."
2,What a let down! Fatal Frame 1 and 2 were MUCH more fun!,"I was so very excited to play this game because I LOVED the first and ESPECIALLY the second, but it was a huge let down. Every thing is way too wordy and the monsters suck to try to kill compared with the first so it is hard but mostly it is just BORING because there is so much READING! Don't get me wrong, I love games with mysteries but all the reading was just stupid stuff that didn't matter and there would be huge long paragraphs of it! Don't waste your money... =("
4,History,"This is a good, short, compact history of all the major events that happened in the war. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a basic idea of what went on during WWII."
5,world war 2,This is a great book to follow on from world war 1. Can be used to refer to over and over.
3,just above the median,"Unfortunately, author Arijon uses illustrations that reinforce the sexual objectification of the female gender in film; thus, his approach to teaching in this regard is limited to the reproduction of one of mainstream cinema's worst deficiencies."
1,High risk with this item,"I bought a Targus iPod lock. After setting the combination, I couldn't unlock the piece. I consider this item a high risk."
5,20000 leagues,"This book is a must keep for both adults and children. The Ron Miller's illustrations and paintings are beautiful and the quality of the book is ++. If you love adventures, Jules Verne, the captain Nemo and the Nautilus this book is for you."
4,Helps,Been taking a lot of new vitamins and minerals and I am starting to feel the effect. This one seems to help as well.
4,NOT BAD AT ALL.,"I was really suprised when I listen this album. I didn't even know that Raven was releasing an album so soon. Wow! I guess the promotion behind this album was really bad. I saw this CD in BEST BUY and I thought I should get it. I'm glad I did though. This CD is not so bad. I was expecting it to be terrible. She really got some good songs on this album. What I really like on this album is there's a mixture of songs. It's R&B, Pop and Rock all together. Raven is not a bad singer either. She doesn't have a Mariah, Celine, or Christina voice but she can carry a tune. I think her voice is still maturing and she did good with the vocals. Overall, Raven did good on this album but the only problem will be the promotion. These days, I hear a lot of good albums with bad promotion. There are a lot of CD's being released today and are selling millions but are garbage. The good CD's are getting no promotion."
5,I LOVE IT,"Raven really out did herself on this album. I love the whole album. i was shocked and amazed by her vocal ability. This album shows that she has matured 100% rather than the image she portrays on That's So Raven. Just Fly Away and Alice are just 2 of my favorites. i would deff. recomend the album. as far as people's opinion on thinking she can't sing, everybody has different taste, so everybody is entitled there own opinion. So i am one of the people that favors her voice and her music."
5,"RAVEN, RAVEN, RAVEN!!!","REVIEW: I really liked this CD. Raven really did well on her songs. I have listened to the CD since my birthday a few weeks ago. I like listening to this music in the morning and in the night. I always wake up with RAVEN, RAVEN, RAVEN. And, I go to sleep with RAVEN, RAVEN, RAVEN!!!"
2,"Raven, You Weren't Cut Out For This","Why is it that every Disney channel actor has to try to become a pop star? Raven, your songs are boring and meaningless, but you're an awsome actor and if I were you, I'd stick with that. ( Although your song Backflip did turn out to be decent )"
5,Good!,"I was pleased with my purchase! The hat was in perfect condition, and it was exactly what I had ordered and expected. It also came in a timely fashion, which I appreciate, especially since it was right before Christmas! :)"
5,Awesome movie!,Lucille Ball does a awesome job in this movie. It has been one of my favorites and when I saw it on Amazon I had to get it!!
2,"Dog loves it, but it doesn't love him","I started giving my dog this a couple of weeks ago. He really loved a different Beneful and so I gave this one a try. He LOVES it and is excited when its time to eat. (He would barely touch Purina Little Bites) I took him out of state to my mom's place and he pooped in the house 3 times! I took the blame for not paying enough attention to him. However, since we've come back home he's pooped in my apt 3 times! (in 1 week) He NEVER does that. I thought that maybe he was being spiteful, but I really think he just can't help it. The food is one hell of a laxative if thats what you're looking for. I'm glad I only bought the small bag because I WILL NOT be giving this one another try. It only gets 2 stars because he likes it and because I'm sure he would lose weight if he keeps pooping this much. TERRIBLE."
1,Disappointed,I am disappointed in this product. Does not fit my 460cc head Nike driver (SUMO 5000) It is very difficult actually impossible to get on the club!!!!
1,Not what I expected,"As both a musician (mindspeak.com) and a meditating Buddhist, I found many things disturbing about this recording. From the musician side, the drum machine was a complete turn-off, as was the ""Third Stone from the Sun"" Jimi Hendrix guitar lick that was mixed in to the first song. The trendy production style on this recording does not do the chants justice. Listeners who aren't familiar with the true beauty of these chants could mistake this New Age treatment for the real thing, which would be unfortunate. The mechanical drum machine sounds provide only Nintendo-like accompaniment, and detract so much from the music. The voice is not heart-felt. The liner notes indicate that both Lama Surya Das and Halpern were college-mates without knowing it, but this collaboration sounds like the direct result of tripping at a late-night pot-smoking party. This is one of few CDs I own that will probably find its way to the used CD store."
2,Not Very Useful,"I love the Eyewitness Guide books, so I figured the Phrase Book would be equally good. Well, I was wrong. Unless I wanted to tell someone in Italian how old I am (which just didn't come up on this trip) or some similarly useless phrase, I found very little help here. Plus, the mini-dictionary in the edition I carried with me only went fron English to Italian. If I had a need to translate an Italian word, unless I knew which category to look under, I was out of luck -- and that's assuming it was in there at all. Use the Eyewitness Guides; they're great. But find another Phrase Book if you want to actually be able to use it in a foreign country."
3,Swanson St. John's Wort,"The problem was that the St. John's Wort was delivered incredibly late. Had I known that Swanson would take that amount of time, I would have preferred to go to the health store and buy the product instead."
3,Air : atmostphere but not solid enough?,"Very listenable, nice melodic hooks. Good atmospheric pop, but in repeated listening, I wonder if there just isn't enough ""there"" there in either the music or the lyrics. I enjoy these guys, but the record is perhaps a little too ""airy."""
1,go away!,she can't sing and whoever thinks so has absolutely no knowledge about music at all cause they're not old enough to remember a time when true talent was dominating the airwaves and not human barbies with no musical talent
1,"Lo and behold, this is the album which marked Hilary's transition from Disney bimbo to fake-punk bimbo","Hilary Duff stinks. Her Madonna remake with her sister (the only Duff with a microscopic shred of talent) blew, and I could do without the travesty that is ""A Cinderella Story"", thanks very much. She looks quite horrid on the cover, btw. Don't buy anything from this punk poser. You'll thank me later."
1,One of the worst singers ever-by Joel,"Real Joel doesn't believe that,but Hilary is very stupid in everything!She doesn't know anything about music.If you want to buy this CD,you have to know you'll just spent your money,when with the same you can buy any GC album,or at least Fallout Boy,Mest,Simple Plan,New Found Glory,Goldfinger,or Blink 182,or anything else you want,(...),when she has not talent at his job.(''actress''-''singer'')."
1,Used to be a fan and then she got...boring!,"I have all her albums, i used to be a huge fan. Then, she just stopped nothing was ever new and I realized she didn't sound unreal, or have a great voice, she was normal. I took down all my posters and put of fall out boy and Green Day posters up. This is why (Besides hilary sounding normal)1. They write their own songs.2. They don't sound like anyone else3. They keep recording4. Their music isn't boring even after putting their songs on repeat5. My friends think they're not cool (I like to be different)6. They ROCK!!"
1,HILARY DUFF SUCKS EVEN MORE!,"Me and my two best friends still agree that Hilary Duff is a complete and total poser.I have one question to ask how did Joel Madden date her without telling her that her music sucked.Please don't buy this.Now b/c she is hangin'with Joel she thinks she can become punk.What the f-ck is that all about?Sorry but I'm really upset.Please don't buy this.You may think I'm just a smartass who has no life, but I'm not I'm just trying to save people from wasting their cash.Please listen to me.Me and my friends listen to real music.Don't but anymore Hilary Duff cd's they are stupid and GAY!"
5,Hilary Rocks my World!,I really like this Hilary Duff CD. Much better than Metamorphasis with a touch of 80's rock. The people who gave this album bad ratings are probably more into hip hop and R&B nowadays! Usher sucks! Ludacris sucks! Eminem sucks! All hip hop and R&B sucks. THis is the perfect album for anyone who either likes pop or rock.
1,SHE is still around?,"I would think that Hilary Fluff would be gone by now. With another album in progress, I wouldn't be surprised if the world ended. Let' s just get to the basic facts, shall we?1. Hilary cannot sing.2. She is a kiddie star.3. Her songs are cliched and repetative.4. She doesn't play any of the instruments.5. She writes like 5 percent of the songs.6.Her songs are so sugar coated, they'll make you puke.7.Even Limp Bizkit is not this bad.8. She is horrible singing live!On the Today show, Hilary sang live in Times Square, to promote her new movie The Perfect Man. Her biggest fans were the ones screaming. The ones screaming were girls in the age ranges of 7-10. Does that say anything?I'm twelve and I don't like her.A friend of mine turned on the CD at her house and it is horrid!If you are younger than twelve, I could make a safe bet that you would love it. For kids twelve and up, skip it.Enough of Duff!!!!"
1,puzzling trend brewing...........,"unskilled studio creations reaping huge benefits that those worthy will never see.and then have their even less skilled siblings following in their lame footsteps.i know,i know.preteens need something to listen to and call their own.this is where hilary fluff and her ilk come in.but who has to cough up the doh-ray-mee?the preteens parents.who have to suffer through listening to such awfullness 24/7?how in gods name did such a crop of horrible eye candy get to be paid to be rancid.if these so called musical picaso's would vanish,would we miss them?or if they werent attractive would they even have cd's/fame?"
5,An amazing cd,I loved this cd! i listen 2 it everyday! it makes a great christmas gift. you should buy it for sure!
3,Decent,"Overall, I didn't think the album is terrible. However, there isn't anything that thrills me, hench the 3 star rating. Still, it is a decent listen. For a Hard Rock album that will thrill you weather you're a Hilary fan or not, check out Anastacia's third album, self-titled ""Anastacia."" It has already gone more than 4 times platinum in Europe! Peace."
2,hmmmmm,"i have to admit hilary is very, very pretty and her talent in acting is pretty good...i used to be her big fan, but, honestly, this album's garbage. songs were quiet okay, except her voice is way too weak to assimiliate any of them. she really should get into acting, not singing. she shouldn't be losing what she already has over making this trash. i still like her, even though not as much as before. i really hope she realizes these..."
4,bein!,"I watched her Cinderella story movie and HAD to go out and buy the CD, i am a Hilary Duff fan, and i enjoyed this CD better than the older one my sister bought."
1,VERY WRONG..,I'm so mad at the some HATERS.Ok .. she's talking about LINDSAY LOHAN .. after LINDSAY said sorry on TV!AND she's actually .. not caring?!OH MY GOSH HIL .. YOU ARE VERY SELFISH.YOUR VOICE CAN be good .. but the song HATERS threw me OFF..
1,I dont really give it 1 star,"I can't stand hilary duff. She is such a insufferable, preppy, tone deaf, and barbie. My little sister blasts hilary's music and i fear for my hearing. And my little sister has started to act just like her. She acts really preppy and talks in a high pitched voice. don't buy this cd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Run for your life if you see it!! I did!!!!! AND I LIVED!!!!!"
3,Not too good...,"While this cd does have about 6 good pop songs, and while hilary is getting better as a singer (she never really sang before her debut) this cd is still just ""okay"".I think this cd is a vast improvement from her debut in every which way but i'm also anticipating a 3rd cd. I feel once she turns 18, she'll really come into her own. and Frankly as long as she stays the way she is as a preformer and not turn weird (like britney spears) then i'll give her much more credit.but i dont suggest this CD to someone over 18 looking for a great cd, i suggest Bonnie McKee's debut ""Trouble""."
3,"""Fly"" Away","""Fly"" is a wonderful song. Hilary Duff actually sounded good, hitting high notes and such. The song has a good beat, and a lot of feeling behind the encouraging lyrics. One of Hilary's best songs yet!But I have to say, I was quite disappointed with the rest of the album. There were just too many slow, boring, so-so songs. I probably only heard two other songs besides ""Fly"" that might be worth listening to.Everyone is slow these days. If you want a change of beat, try Avril Lavigne, Jonny Lang, and my favorite Christian rock band, Kutless."
2,not quite up to par,"this record is not quite up to par as a multi platnum singer has potential to make. Her less than good vocal range is really apparent when she trys to sing the lows and highs. hil needs to work with the middle octaves and not exceed her limit.the only real good song on the whole album is fly, the first single and first song on he 17 song disc. for hil, she should stick with the 10-12 song range. her voice causes pain in the ears and for me a headache trying to listen to the record once all the way through.Haters and Mr. James Dean are pointless songs that should never have been writen or recorded int he studio.i loved hils debut cd for the innocent, pop hooks and melodies that are truely lacking on her sophmore disc. Hint for buyers- if you buy, dont expect more than a little child singing kareoke at the local county fair."
1,No growth in sophmore album,"it seems to me that hilary duff is just trying to make money off the tweens of middle-class America. Her album consists of pointless songs that she personally didn't expierence, therefore she has no prespective on the matter and is clearly seen through the music. Don't get me wrong, i do not dislike her, and she has a wonderful talent. yup, so thats just my take on her"
1,haha,my god people actually-really actually listen to this utter garbage. to the people who write these reviews: WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU. i dont know if you can curse in your reviews here but i would if i could. it amazes me that with so so so much amazing music out there people are actually listening to this stupid girly girl wannabe. id list some bands to listen to but you're only allowed so many words. honestly people- Hillary Duff!??? Hillary Dufff?!!!! ugh now ive lost my appetite
5,Awsome!!!,"THis album is Great!I am a fan of all kinds of music form K's Choice to Shakira to The who and Rush matthew good and yes Hilary Duff, and no i am not a 7 year old girl I'm 18, and people have to stop raggin' on the poor girl for not writing her own music, hello people that is why there are Songwriters in the world!!!Avril claimed to write her first album wich was much better than the second she actually did write!!! Leave Hil alone and broaden your horizon'sHATERS!!!!!!"
2,Apex Digital is a horrible company.,"Apex Digital products often fail within the first year. They have horrible customer service, false advertising, and fail to honor their warranties. Please check www.labbb.gov (Better Business Bureau) and search for Apex Digital to see the F rating the better business bureau has given them. Saving 10-15 dollars is not worth the hassle they cause."
5,Great album(s),"Lost Tracks of Danzig is a complilation of all the ""lost"" demos that were'nt included on all Danzig albums from the self titled album to Circle of Snakes. It's a two disc set with 26 tracks total in chronilogical order, and I know what your thinking....no it doesn't get worse as it goes along!!! ALL the songs here should have made it onto the albums (producers...can't live with em, can't live without em), and they are all classic Danzig songs. Great to throw in when you don't feel like listening to Grind-core, Deathmetal, Grind-Death/Gore-Grind and/or Death-Grind. Well worth the asking price, highly recommended."
4,Turn off your radio and turn on The Catheters,"This is what its all about. Wow, if only you knew. Probably one of the top Seattle bands at the moment (playing this coming weekend, hope to catch them) this album will blow your mind. Lots of the Stooges in their sound - but theres lots lots more, buy this now , crank it up and breathe the air."
4,"Fun for Kids, Parents - Get the mop!","A great fun indoor beach for kids to wallow in especially in the depths of a snowy winter day. But kids plus water equals some mess so place this in a heated workshop, basement or place you don't mind water on the floor. A joy for kids missing summer. Parents, beware!"
4,A rigorous read,"Since I need to be selective of any novel, never having time for this guilty pleasure, this was well worth the read.I have even written the Diane Rehm show for it was her show that prompted me to pick it up. Pope Brock is a very insightful writer, and those who like this style will be impressed. Those who like historical accuracy or dry repetition of court docket entries will be disappointed.I think this could be mistaken for ""romance novel"", but it really has in-depth character development on timeless moral themes:justice, passion and deciet.I really enjoyed being ""teased"" into shock over how bold and brash Allie and Ham were. It really made Scarlett and Rhett look like rank ametuers. Also I enjoyed not feeling sorry for the ""wronged"" Link and Maggie, whose denial and complaceny almost had you laughing at their naivete.I do think Pope Brock pulled off an ambitious tale that was probably as exhilirating to write as it was to read."
3,Review,Nothing new or amazing in this anime. Simple story line with lots of boy touches girl accident incidents! Ending of the story seems rushed. It's a solid 3 stars; will stay in the collection.
4,This guy's pretty good,I see Burt Levy compared to JD Salinger. If Salinger is this good I guess I'll have to try reading him again.
2,Good Product--Outrageously Expensive!,"I love the product but bought mine at Wal-Mart in FondDulac, WI for $3.99 each. Made by an Israeli company. It's wonderful but the price is just way way too high. It's only a plastic tub for goodness sake!!"
5,The Magic of Knife,"This CD really is great!!! The songs are filled with total happiness. You'll love to groove to ""Space Christmas,"" relax to the rhythm of ""Froot Loop Dreams"" and get a craving for chocolate when you hear ""I wanna eat Chocobars."" Or if you don't wanna do any of these, you can feel uplifted by the happy music Shonen Knife can provide. It is a great CD full of bouncy songs to get you moving if you need a lift.Enjoy!!!!!!"
3,Not their sharpest.,"This is what I would call a fanatic-only collection. It's all good, just not really good, hence b-sides I guess. The best here is the cover of ""(Love IS Like A) Heatwave"", ""Top Of The World"" which is a Carpenters song, and this version of ""Little Tree"". None of this is bad of course, and they are hard not to like, but for newcomers the albums are much better. I recommend either ""Let's Knife"" or ""Rock Animals"" for someones first Shonen Knife disc. Those albums are much less-dull."
1,Suddenly,"Suddenly, Doris' children and father have disappeared. Viewers asked why their funerals weren't covered. Was it some terrible automobile accident or an earthquake? So, if you lose your father and children, you comfort yourself by having fashion shows. Doris Day herself said this series was ill conceived, and that she isn't proud of it. I agree, Doris. I give it 1 star, Doris Day wishes to forget she ever did it. One thing I will say, even at her age, she looked great in the expensive clothes. Although some looked like they should be on younger women, she still had a great figure.Let's face it, Doris Day is wonderful, but she was never able to adapt to television. She still thought she was doing a Hollywood premier, not a TV series. This is a boring season, if you want excitement, watch the grass growing on your lawn."
3,only one issue,"the only thing that we dont like about the toys is that the hats barely stay on. they fall off very easy. so it causes a lot of frustrations throughout the day. other than that, my kid loves the toys."
1,DON'T BUY,"I bought this as for my 1 1/2 year old little boy who loves Curious George, and it arrived the quality was so POOR. I could have got a better quality one from the circus for a buck!"
2,I just didnt find it captivating,I just didn't find it a good write-up. Perhaps the writer was interested more in putting up a book to just compliment her website content. I just feel a lot of personal imaginations from the writer mind. You just feel that.
2,Not long enough to reach,"Very disappointed, unable to use this product attached to hospital bed rails as intended. When patient is in upright drinking position, beverage holder is not long enough to reach, even with a long straw. Very lightweight, does not hold a large or heavy beverage- looks like it might work with a small paper or plastic cup, but who has time to keep refilling those? Would not purchase this item for its intended use."
1,"Fits the CF62T, But...","I ordered this $20 battery instead of the less-expensive $10.00 alternative because I wanted a battery that performed like the original. I was initially happy when it showed up, because marked right there on the box it said it was a 750 mAh (milliamp-hour) battery. When I went to install it, however, I noticed the battery itself is marked as having a 600 mAh capacity.I thought maybe the battery was mis-packaged. So I contacted Amazon's customer service via the link on their webpage. That was a month ago, still no reply.So did I get ripped off? Did they send me the $10 battery in the $20 package? Was it mislabeled? Who knows. Just don't depend on Amazon's customer service to look into an issue like this. They've got their money, and apparently that's all that matters."
5,a1 makin it good,"Make it Good, an awesome song from a1's third international album. What can I say? I agree with everyone else who has been an a1 fan over the past years. They have really matured and left that boyband pop behind them.So what? Their a boy band, duh, they're boys and their a ""band"" so they deserve the title. What I'm trying to say is, they are not an N'SYNC or BSB clone.They've got beautiful voices, solid harmonies as I've said thousands of times before.This song really displays how much they've matured in their music. The other two tracks show it.Their third album, is my favorite because they really have a great sound, and not like their previous albums.The video is great, this song deserves to be at the top of the charts. They sing it excellently.Hopefully I've helped anyone out there who needs to know about this single."
3,WARNING: Boy's Club-- No Girls Allowed,Unfortunately this purportedly comprehensive survey of landscape architecture fails to include even one woman in the entire history of the profession. It's as though the female gender never existed! It is inexcusable that this book is still in current use as a university text.
1,NEAR INSULIN SHOCK..,"This book was a gift from a 'southern' friend in an effort to explain the 'southern psyche?!' Good, lord, I thought I'd die of hackneyed plot development and platitude! The truly interesting aspects were never persued nor explained -- the mother--southern woman personified and yet left to hang -- the ill-fated father -- zip! Ultimately a mawkish effort at 'southern literature' that leaves the reader unfulfilled and the genre stagnant. I am shocked to learn this thing has been compared to Harper Lee and Truman Capote! Are people just not reading anymore, are they just stupid, or what? After a brief while; you just don't give a damn and want to finish the thing. If this is the present/future of 'southern letters,' I'm even more glad the North won the Civil War!"
4,weather tech cargo liner,Does not fit exactly even though I gave my car info and Amazon said it would fit. However it does the job and saves my cargo space from getting worse than it was.Seems to be well made shipping was right on.
1,Poker Countdown Tournament Timer,My artificial intelligent computer was tired of all the 'Mickey Mouse' (children's) Poker/chess games and Poker Countdown Tournament was one 'she' selected.
4,A Great Beginners Guide to Tahiti,"This is a great introductory book on Tahiti. A previous reviewer gave this book two stars because it reads like a children's book. Well, that's because this series, Cultures of the World, is a children's book series. This is a very readable intoduction to the human and physical geography of Tahiti."
4,good start but not comprehensive,"Focusing on the Greek and Roman world is the purpose of this book, thus the title might misled some readers. Likewise there are important people and events missing from it which even an advanced undergraduate would be able to see. But for the price it is good basic reference for the layperson or undergraduate whose interest in the Greeks and Romans stops at a few classes and a few books."
4,"fine suit, fine price","This is a fine suit. by comparison, I also have a Body Glove full, a Body Glove shorty, and a Brave (a local NJ house brand) shirt. The Mercury is just as good as any of those.Last autumn, while trying to surf a tropical storm with a long board, I finned myself quite well, slicing a big chunk off the back of my Mercury wet suit and getting blood stains all over a *brand new* white rash guard I wore underneath. I like the Mercury so much that I went out & bought another one."
4,"Good value, will keep you warm","We have one in smaller size and with growing young men in the family- needed a larger size. Went with the same suit again because we had no problems with the other one.I think the sizing runs a little small but these are our first wet suits, so don't have a lot of experience on the sizing."
5,US DIvers Wet Suits,"Bought two of these and used the sizing guide based on weight. Got 'em in good shape, and on time. They fit exactly as expected. Very good quality wetsuits, at a price I couldn't get from the scuba store. Amazon does it again!"
1,Not Quality,"I got this wet suit for a scuba trip to St. Kitts and Nevis. I was planning on using my Aqualung 3mm shorty for most dives, but wanted a full for a deep wreck dive and the night dives. I was trying to keep cost down because it was not intended for a whole lot of use. It was delivered very quickly as everything is with Amazon Prime, but when I got it it was either ripped, or not sewn correctly where the chest plate meets the neoprine covering the ribs. There was about a 2 inch tear (or maybe it just wasnt sewn correctly) on the left side. I hade no time to exchange it or get a new one so I used it on a dive anyway but there was no seal and it was pretty useless. Overall the quality seemed to be very low. I went back to the shorty for all dives and left this with the local dive shop to use for renters. What a waste of money..."
5,Very good!,"Bought this suit for Jet skiing in the Gulf of Mexico (which DOES get cold in winter!).Fits great, looks good and keeps me warm in water temperatures of about 55F while riding at up to 60MPH in even colder air temperatures.Definitely recommended for colder days!"
5,Great value!,"Perfect fit if you read the reviews like I did and purchase one size larger than the size chart. I have a 17"" neck and the XXL fit me perfect at 5'11 190lbs."
2,M9 Airsoft Gun Pistol,Air soft guns are very fun but I will never buy this pistol again. It frequently jam and sometimes when a bullet is caught around the chamber or even stuck it jams the gun and plastic pieces start to break off.
4,Pretty Good Gun,This gun was really good. it has some plastic and metal pieces and it is a good gun for beginners.
1,Disappointment,I got two of these for Christmas. 1 broke after 4 shots. It is spring by the way. It doesn't say so I typed in electric pistol and this came up. The only good thing that came out of this is that now I have an extra mag for the one that still works. DO NOT get this gun. If you are looking for a good pistol get a JLS electric. This gun sucks
2,low quality,We only payed 1 cent plus a few dollars shipping. That is what this gun is worth.We bought 2. My son used it hard.One jam per day for the first few days that required gun disassembly.After 5 days the first one broke. The second one broke a few days later.Some of the internal working parts have stupid design flaws that means this gun will probably never last for very long.
2,Not durable,"I purchased this toy gun for a Halloween prop. I only shot it about 10 times and some plastic piece broke off. The plastic pellets came out with pretty good force. The net is that it was pretty good while it lasted, but that was not very long."
4,M9 Airsoft Gun Pistol hand gun,"The toy guns were much nicer than the cost of the item ($3). One broke easily when we dropped it (quite a far distance), but that was no fault of the item. It still works great as a halloween prop which was it's intended purpose. One thing to note is these look very realistic (even with the orange tip), and they come with a warning about taking them outside in public and how it can be easily mistaken for a real gun.The item was shipped quickly, there was good communication from seller, and I would buy from them seller again."
2,Not really good,"i mean for a penny you really cant go wrong, but you really get what you pay for. When i got it outta the mail i took a shot and it really didnt leave the barrel. then after a couple more shots it only went like 10ft no lie......it broke today in just about the first 2 hours i had it..and i got it today!...the trigger broke...the only good thing about it is it has an ok feel and easy to cock.....plz dont get it for about $7 with shipping and handeling....it really is worth a penny"
1,Bad do not buy,Do not buy this gun cause when I got ky the screw were not tight and try did not fit and I spent hours trying to fix the clip but when I got it fixed I say that u can't fill up the full clip or they just shoot out crash when u cock it and the safety broke when I was having a battle with one of my friends they trigger just broke and never worked so I just threw it away cause it was only 70 sent so don't but this gun. But it if u want a price of crap
1,bb gun view,Hello I recently paid for a this m9 Airsoft Gun Pistol hand gun and as soon I inserted a couple of BB pellets this gun got james and broke.
1,HORRIBLE!,"This gun shot bad, very weak and lasted 15 minutes before breaking! I really am dissatisfied thanks for robbing me."
4,Good for prop,"This gun has an excellent feel to it and is great for being a prop for halloween, cosplay, or a play. But I wouldn't recommened it for anything else, while it does fire and is fun to fire (and even safe to fire at someone's body at about a 10 foot distance.) I would give it five stars but a bit of the plastic broke around the tigger, it still works but its still not good. Also although is doesn't show it there is a laser poniter attached to the gun but it is easily removed."
1,cheap cheap,"After waiting more than week we received the package and my son was excited about that, It looks cheap just plastic, It broke within first hour. Don't spend money piece plastic no worth."
1,Not worth the $0.01 I paid,I purchased two of these items and both broke within 5 minutes. Wasnt worth the penny I paid for them. I do not recommend them to anyone.
1,Fell Apart,"My son was so excited to get this gun. It came in the mail on time and looked fine, but fell completely apart the day after getting it. He is so disappointed now."
2,Not really that good.,"The guns are quite appealing, and are very cheap. For their price being so low, I expected for it to not work well. I have ordered many of airsoft weapons from hotimporttoys and all of them seem to have the same problem. They shoot good and accurate, but the slides will malfunction if you put more than three bb's in the clip. This results in the gun slide either preventing the gun to shoot, or just breaking the gun entirely. I have also ordered the ""1000 bag of airsoft bb's"" and a couple days later I got this small plastic bag, with maybe a 100 in it. As I am very upset with their products and false advertising, I will purchase no more products from this ""company"". I will also ensure that none of my kin or friends will too."
3,Hello from FEEDMBEANS,"UB40 is part-reggae part-rock, and often I listen to them. It gets better and better as they start to sing in England. I seen their albums. They're awesome."
3,sand box set,"Got a sandbox for my nephew's 2nd birthday and had to get these to go with it... They're okay...I wouldn't pay that price for them again, after seeing them... Believe it or not, they were difficult to put together! He's enjoying them, but I wish I would've seen them before purchasing...."
1,Buyer Beware!! Sony does not stand behind thier own design!!,Buyer beware - I bought this camera for my daughter in Dec 2003. In June 2004 the flash stopped working.I contacted Sony and they said - sorry - out of warantee. That will be $140. Sorry!!! 90 day warantee on their workmanship. Does not say much about their confidense in their workmanship does it? Sony can pound sand. They will NEVER get $$$ from me again. They have this terrible warantee on many products. BOYCOTT SONY !!!!!!!!
5,Awsome camera perfoms perfectly never leave home without it,I purchased this camera as a cheaper option to any other camera with a $400 marine housing as I dont intend on diving 40 metres the u60 is perfect for my surfing pics and a bit of reef photography. I bought this 7 months ago for $380 and its the best money I've ever spent taking fishing and surfing and everywhere wet the images are crystal clear and I dont see any differnce in image quality between this and my 5 megapixel camera.
2,A decent entry level camera,I like this camera but after a couple of years the screen now shutters and you have to turn it on and off to get it to stop. Life expectancy is a little less than I had hoped for.
5,UNIQUE MENTAL IMAGERY!,"From the very first page of text the reader is sent on an incredible journey with the main character, Nova. Nova is that child that we all can identify with when he says ""Is this how my father feels when he's away?"". The idea that his Dad will surely find him and finally their reunion and struggle to get back home keep the reader totally engaged. Back at home Nova is greeted as a hero - something all children can identify with.My 6 year old liked the idea that Nova followed his dream of exploring space. He thought that the illustrations looked exactly as he had imagined outer space to be. He thinks it is great the way Nova brings his spaceships and models to share with the class and the idea that they take field trips. We read this book over and over never tiring of the story and vibrant illustrations."
4,I'd like to see more stories about Kendra,"TaRessa's debut novel was excellent. Being an up and coming PR exec myself, I know exactly what she's going through. I would like to see some background info about how all three became friends and their undergrad experience, then fast-forward about 10 years and show us where their at. Overall, great book."
5,"practical, simple to the point concepts to have you playing endgames with some sense","There might be more thorough books on endgames outhere. But i really like this one because practicly in no time i learned and apply simple concepts and guidelines on how to play no-nonsense endgames. I still have to fight it off with higher and stronger players but i definetely enjoy playing endings and have stollen one or two theoritical or practical draws by outplaying or even tiring out many players just doing my best to apply the concepts learned on this book. There was at least a review saying the book lacks more examples , i think that is correct but i still give it 5 stars because i find it a very down to earth and inmensely practical book on the subject."
4,From the publisher's blurb...,"""In this valuable resource for African students and indigenous preachers and missionaries, the author explains the importance of preaching in Africa by using African historical, cultural and traditional imagery in order to communicate the gospel more effectively. This book provides insight into the value of indigenous preaching, imagery, and concepts (rather than missionary-given Western forms) and offers a vision for preaching in Africa for the next millennium."" This book was the book of the week pick for CMDNet (August 12, 2001)"
1,This is junk!,"very poor quality, hard to put together, if it was not so much trouble I would be sending back, do not buy this product."
4,Cosco Chair/Step Stool 11-130WHT,"My wife wanted a chair/step stool for the kitchen, I have bought several different models over the last couple years and sent them all back. I got her this one and she really likes it. It is tall enough (I think it could be a little taller) to sit at the stove top and stir the soup and look out the window, and the seat flips up and she can use the step stool to reach the taller kitchen cabinets. It was easy to assemble, seems quite sturdy and everyone who comes into the kitchen wants to sit on it."
2,Not what expected from Cosco,"This just not get it as a kitchen work stool. Much too low, useless as such, very uncomfortable most especially the back, small, narrow seat. I plan to remove the back and find another place in house to use it, example; spare seat at dinner table, possibly sitting at my synth, doing small projects at a desk/work area. Old Cosco seats much, much better! Assembly does take some time, not a simple put together, be prepared. Keep in mind that it does not fold for tucking away when not being used"
4,Good value,We bought this for the kitchen. It is solid and well made. The top step is somewhat narrow for those with larger feet. I would definitely recommend it.
1,Poor quality,"I had the chair/step stool for less than 2 weeks and the seat padding ""shifted"", leaving a ""dented"" appearance in the front area. I wannted just to have the seat part exchanged, but according to the Amazon customer service, EITHER I get a refund OR I have to have the WHOLE chair/ step stool replaced. I could get the whole thing here, replace the seat, and send the rest back, but it is such a problem because the box is huge and the problem can be simplified................."
4,Handy and Lightweight,"It's a bear to put together, but it does a great job. It's lightweight so it's easy to move where needed. The seat flips to use it as a stepladder, and, when it's down, it provides a handy seat or a place to put things, like a basket of laundry. Definitely a bargain."
3,Cafe Kichijouji de vol.1,CKD is a good manga to have in between mangas. I like to think of it as a great comic strip rather than a manga :P there's alot of lovable characters (who are quite attractive to boot) and a pretty funny situation going on.I will definitely be buying the next as soon as I get some extra money :P
2,WORTHLESS!!!!!,"Turners song is good but the rest sucks! Eric serra is an insult to james bond. I have never heard the theme butchered this bad before. you want a good soundtrack? get Tomorrow Never Dies, It sure beat this junk!"
5,I feel like Bond when listening to it.,Quite possibly one of the most emotionally stirring and stimulating scores ever produced. This sountrack combines traditional(orchestral) music with exhilerating techno-beat. I would recomend this soundrack to family friends and even strangers on the street.
4,only heard oe track and already loving it,"quite frankly i love what iv herd from the sound track, im 16 and a real fan of james bond and techno. i only herd track 10 but i love it so much i just play it over and over. when you listen to i you can almost see bond driving the t54 tank through the streets and over cars, and the male sounds are MAD, it seems like the gurds are singing to ityou must buy it!"
4,Goldeneeeeeeyyeeeeee!,"The soundtrack to the film that put Bond films back in action is an exciting, pulsating score by Eric Serra. Throughout the running time, Serra provides some great material, and while most of it is bereft of the staple Bond theme, it still makes for an interesting action- driven soundtrack, with The Goldeneye Overture being the highlight. Add the stomping title track from Tina Turner and some quiet, romantic titles (""That's what keeps you Alone"" and ""For ever, James""), and you have an impressive score that's fitting to listen to on it's own. Cool stuff."
3,GOLDENEYE CD,"IT'S AN OK SOUNDTRACK BUT THEY LEFT OUT THE GUN BARREL MUSIC AND FOR ""A PLEASENT DRIVE IN ST.PETERSBURG"" PETHETIC!!! THAT SONG IS NOT WORTHY OF ""OO7"""
2,WORTHY EFFORT BUT JUST MISSED THE TARGET,THIS SOUNDTRACK IS A WORTHY EFFORT BUT THE BIG QUESTION HERE IS WHY THE SCORES MOST FILM REMEMBERED MOMENT THE TANK CHASE ALSO KNOWN AS A PLEASANT DRIVE IN ST PETERSBURG HAS BEEN REPLACED ON THIS ALBUM WITH A TRACK THAT NEVER MADE IT INTO THE FILM IT MAKES YOU WONDER IF MR SERRA EVEN SCORED THAT PEICE OF MUSIC THAT DID MAKE IT INTO THE FILM AND IF HE DID NOT COMPOSE IT THE PRODUCERS OF THE FILM SHOULD HAVE HIRED THIS MYSTERY MAN INSTEAD HE DID A MUCH BETTER JOB. BECAUSE OF THIS I RANK THIS CD ONE OF THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF THE BOND MUSIC SERIES AND WE HIGHLITE THE LOW IT DOES FOR ALL IT WEAKNESSES LEAVE YOU ASKING ONE MORE QUESTION WHY FOR YOUR EYES ONLY SOUNDTRACK IS NOT AVAILABLE BUT THIS IS IT WAS A MUCH MORE UP TO DATE SCORE THAN THIS
4,i love it!,i love treasure in the royal tower!it was my first nancy drew game.i also have danger on deception island.it is my all-time favorete nancy drew ever!i really recomend both of them.
5,. . .With the Spirit of a Traffic Jam,This album can only be described in three words:Best Album Ever.
5,It just works.,Filter took less than a minute to install and resolved my issue with cable channels interfering with internal channels. My cable company had started using empty channels in the 70s for encrypted digital channels which caused my internally modulated channels to stop working. In installed this filter and didn't lose any functionality but did clear up my internal channels.
3,Great if....,This wrench works great if... you have room to move the length of the handles. It works without a problem on my Wrangler but is useless on my 1999 F-150.
5,SOULFULLY THE BEST !!!,"THIS CD IS A RARE GEM. THE STAND OUT TRACK HOWEVER IS BY FLORENCE BALLARD. AFTER HEARING HER WITHOUT THE SUPREMES YOU REALIZE WHY DIANA ROSS NEVER WANTED HER TO SING LEAD. DIANA SHOULD HAVE FEARED FLO..FLO WAS THE FOUNDER OF THE GROUP AND COULD HAVE VERY EASILY BEEN LEAD SINGER. SHE ALSO HAD GREAT RANGE, NOT WHINEY AND THINLIKE DIANA. THIS CD IS DEFINATELY A MUST TO OWN..."
4,Complete Book of Bass Essentials (no fluff),"Regardless of how much experience one actually have in playing a bass guitar, there are basically two types of people who might pick up this book: (1) those with a music theory background and (2) those without a music theory background. This book contains very few explanations or instructions. Instead it takes the reader through all the scales and modes along with a few patterns for each. The author also includes excellent diagrams of the fretboard that maps the fingering for each scale or mode as well as some examples of different styles of improvisation. If you have a good theory background and want to learn to play bass, this book will be an excellent tool. If you are weak in music theory, it would be best to pick up a music theory book in addition to this one in order to fully reap the benefits. If you are both an experienced bass player and musician, this book is a handy reference."
5,fast service,book came before the last due date it was packaged well so the book came in good shape!! will use again
5,Thriller by a master epic story teller,"I have enjoyed Ken follett for hs epic stories, second to none, like the pillars of the earth or the recent century series. Triple is very different, but for the quality of the story telling. It is a classic international spy thriller, like many others around, but with the special follett touch: deep characters, complex human interactions and a well researched background. This is a page turner of great quality. Highly recommended."
3,Held My Attention,"Follett takes a set of not quite believable characters and blends them together into a story that flows smoothly. If you like espionage, intrigue and sex mixed in with a little Mafia, a touch of academia, a smidgen of nuclear threat, and the high seas, you'll probably like this book. As in so many modern American novels, the firm porn (midway between soft and hard) is a little monotonous unless you happen to have a bit of the peeping Tom in you. Like so much in this fantastic story it is contrived but folded smoothly into the storyline. When I began skipping over the heavy breathing and anatomical explorations the story improved measurably."
3,OK,"Not Follett's finest work, but worth the read especially @ the kindle price. Some nail bitting moments, but the historical points hard to follow."
1,Never bothered to finish,"After reading 4 Ken Follet novels within a few months, I was disappointed with this one. After 125 pages, I decided I didn't care at all for any of the characters or the story - onto another; hope it's better. Really enjoyed Pillars of the Earth, World without End, A Dangerous Fortune, and The Hammer of Eden."
3,Intrigue,This was usually a page turner. Sometimes It felt that the cast of characters was a real stretch to keep connected across the storyline. And the detail in the romantic scenes is gratuitous and detracts from the political intrigue.
3,Stay Hungry - No Sustenance Here!,"I'm sure this movie was written just to showcase 3 great stars: Jeff Bridges, Sally Field, and Arnold Schwarzenegger. It's a story about a guy trying to save his gym from being taken by the bad guys. Ho hum! It's a riot to see the biggest of the big (Arnold) standing next to the smallest of the small (Sally Field). She's so cute! Nothing much here except 2 great movie stars and early Arnold with packed-on muscles."
1,Stay Away!,"I thought this was a romance drama with Jeff Bridges and Sally Field. It was the dumbest movie I've ever seen! I couldn't figure out what they were doing. ""The Governator,"" Arnold Schwarzenegger is a philosopher/ body builder and Mr. Olympia contestestant. I couldn't understand what he was saying. Save your money. Buy King Kong ('76) instead."
3,cAN'T HELP IT!,For some reason i have always been in LOVE sexually and emotionally with Sally. GREAT SHOT OF HER BEAUTIFUL ASS!
5,Excellent selections from A Course in Miracles,"This is an excellent little book to have if you just want a collection of the more poetic and prayerful selections from A Course in Miracles. Various selections are grouped together based on a themes, such as forgiveness etc. Makes a great gift for anyone who feels a connection with the basic ideas of A Course in Miracles."
4,Real baking on a smaller scale,"I admit I was a little suprised when I picked up this book - the amount of work and cooking times involved in the recipes are comparable to baking a full size batch of something (i.e. making six cookies took almost as long as making 24). The recipes have just as much fat and sugar as regular desserts, so it's not for anyone looking to be healthy. However, it is exactly what it promises to be - conveniently reduced (and easy!) recipes that make small batch of each item so you don't have to worry about over eating or letting food go to waste. I look forward to trying more recipes from this book and wish I'd found it years ago!"
2,Small Batch Baking,"While this is a wonderful concept, this book is poorly written and edited. The very first recipe in the book omits several ingredients. Further in the same chapter ingredients in the ingredient list flow in to each other, as 3 T. butter 1/4c. flour all on the same line.This book has many recipes and with a some comparing and research the incorrect ones can be salvaged. I would never bake and serve any of the recipes untested."
5,Good All The Way,Not just for empty-nesters or newly graduated students but also for large families who have to deal with different taste buds.Good tip about recylcing cans and using those as baking tins since there are not alot of options for small baking utensils right now.I loved this book and as someone living alone it is good fun.
1,Not impressed so far.,"Purchased this book because my husband and I are empyt nesters. I tried to make the ""Really Fudgy Cupcakes"" recipe TWICE and it did not come out correctly either time. I am not a novice baker and do understand about being precise w/measures etc. Hopefully the next recipe I try will come out."
3,A good starting point,"This book is a good starting point, but there are a few aggravations and disappointments. Far too many of the recipes use prepared baking mixes. If I wanted to use a mix, I wouldn't need a cookbook. I certainly don't want a dozen partial, opened mixes sitting in my pantry after I've used a cup. Also, baking in tin cans is a BAD IDEA. If you want to poison yourself, definitely go that route. If you've got two brain cells to rub together, use ramekins and souffle dishes of varying sizes. The author even says in the book to not use each can for baking more than a couple of times because they start to deteriorate. One would think that would have told her something about the safety of cooking in cans and leaching metals, but apparently not.Other than that, I'm pretty happy with it. Many of the recipes could have used more testing and proofreading, but if you're an experienced baker and capable of tweaking recipes, it's a good reference."
1,What a sham DON'T BUY!,"Unfortunately this book isn't what it's billed as. Lola Cashman paints a very distorted picture of U2 that completely contradicts every other backstage account. It cannot be emphasized enough that she's an ex-employee, asked to leave, and is now trying to use her time with U2 for a monetary advantage. Ms. Cashman tries too hard to inject herself into the U2 ""lifestyle"". Rather than it being an objective 3rd person account of life as a HAIR DRESSER for U2, she instead tries to inject herself into the band itself as though she was a member. What you have is an angry, ex-employee, still believing she is part of the band.Any doubts? Just go read the press and see what the band has to say about her."
5,Trudell,This is one of the best films I have seen in alongtime. I would highly recommend it and if you don'tknow alot about John Trudell it will give youalot of insight. I am looking forward to gettingsome of his music with poetry..
2,What price glory?,"I was really dismayed by the reactionary rhetoric of those days (Means et al wanting to go back to the buffalo) - I wondered where it came from and who they claimed to represent. Did anything positive ever come of it all? The culmination was when Trudell (a navy veteran) burned the American Flag on national TV and within 12 hours several of his family members were killed in a house fire at Duck Lake, NV. What did he expect in those violent times? Didn't he realize the price he would have to pay? I was reminded of an impulsive little kid playing with a dangerous loaded weapon. Go to any country and burn their flag on national TV and see what happens! Nowhere in this movie did I hear him take any direct or indirect personal responsibility for what happened to his family, but only to blame others. Hopefully, our youth of today have learned that your behavior is a function of its consequences and to take personal responsibility for your actions!"
1,don't judge a book by it's cover,"I bought this book based on the reccomendation from the other reviewer. When I received it, I was immediately impressed by the cool cover. However, after opening it, I found that it was essentially a 2 inch 3-ring binder with about 100 pages in it. About 2/3 of these pages are blank, and are supposed to be used to write your thoughts while traveling. The rest have very brief travel hints and recipes. The information was very superficial (i.e. names and addresses of restaurants) and would likely be available as a freebie from any tourist office in the BVI. Oh yes, there are also about 5 pages of plastic sleeves for inserting your own photos.This book was not worth the $30 price. Luckily I was able to return the book to Amazon and get a refund on my money, but I'm still out the $8 in shipping costs. If I could have ranked it zero stars, I would have."
2,Basic Book,"A basic outline of what psychiatry is about based on a survey. Might be informative to lay people, but its really about psychiatry in the 1960's."
2,almost unwatchable,The coloring is sub-par as is the sound. The addition of updated sound effects are horrible they are louder than the cartoon itself with added effects that shouldnt even be there. You can occasionally hear the original effects intermixed with the ones that were added. Popeye is worthy of a ... package with original content enough of these bargain basement throw aways
3,Expectations,"This flash drive is nice regarding price and size, however the overall design isn't great. I was expecting a fairly solid piece of equipment but the drive is pressed together, molded plastic that does not feel like it will hold up for very long. It's a bit brittle and the paint chips off easy. I will say the lanyard system is great."
1,Former Uniden fan,"I bought this system when it first came out and never have I spent more on a phone. I bought the DMX778 plus 2 of the satellite units. The caller ID has NEVER worked, and customer service NEVER helped. They were very adept at giving me the run-around though. The quality is so poor that whomever I am speaking with gets static. No matter how I adjust the sound, I can never hear very well either. This 2.4 GHz unit often says I have no service due to being out of range RIGHT NEAR THE BASE UNIT. The outgoing greeting on the answering system sounds fine, but all incoming messages are INAUDIBLE. I have had many Unidens and always loved them. I'll try to dig up my 900 MHz as it always worked better than this expensive system (still, these many years later). These are really pieces of poo-poo."
3,Enjoyable but Overly Anticlimactic,"Much of this book is vivid, funny, and even moving. McGuane's 7-page description of Joe's desperate drive from Miami to Montana is terrific -- I haven't read a better summary of a cross-country trip.But I felt the author went a bit too far in deflating just about everything in the last several chapters. Obviously, that's a valid artistic choice, but I was left shrugging my shoulders -- ""Whatever...""I'm glad that I read Keep the Change, but my initial excitement died away somewhat as the book progressed. I think a similarly deflationary approach was much more successful in the final pages of McGuane's ""Panama."""
3,Not For Portables...,"So I'm torn on this review. I bought this to use with my various ipods, thinking I'd have a nice volume control at my fingertips. Which I do. It is well made (relatively speaking) and sounds fine - volume control (with separate left/right control) works well and is easy to control by feel without looking.The problem is I should have looked more closely at the photo... that cable is LONG! The specs don't mention the length, but the thing has to be at least 10 feet - maybe more. Definitely NOT for portable use unless you want to be tripping over it or have a huge tied up cable in your pocket.It's my own fault for not looking more closely, but this product, while it works well, was not what I was looking for."
2,Below Average,"Ms. Moses' book is divided in two parts -- (1) description of new trends in the labor marketplace (perhaps the better part of the book) and (2) some suggestions as to how to navigate it.The strength of the first part of the book is in the generational analysis of how the labor market and relationships between jobs, sorporations and people have changed from pre-baby boomers, to baby boomers to gen-X. The rest of the first part is a filler -- everybody who works knows that there is no longer such thing as life-long employment.The second part of the book is where the author, in my opinion, falls seriously short! There is nothing new or original here. Much more practical of Ms. Moses' ""What's Next"". If you are looking for a career management book look at ""The 5 Patterns of Extraordinary Careers"""
3,Tired trying,"Buried in too much technicality for artsy brutality lies a more appealing work than their previous, but the over-trying sounds obvious still, especially when measured up to the memorability of such a dazzling debut."
3,dude just go hd,"I know... your saying to yourself how will I ever plug in these old outdated cables into one spot, well here is your answer. This is a low quality unit that does the job but not with flying colors by any means, this will simplify but it won't make what you see look any better in fact it might degrade the final picture you see... but if all u got is $30 and a bunch of rca cables to plug in then this might be for you."
4,Just what I needed,"Modulator arrived quickly and was packed well. I bought it for the kids to hook up all their video games to one tv. Works perfectly. If it was for me and my TVs, I would have went the extra to get one with a remote."
1,The Best of the best,"OK this Tina Turner lady is the most of my favorite artist. She is always the best mostly this album here (Wildest Dreams). Why? Cuz one of the songs in her album always touch my heart! She called the song (Missing you?.So every of my time i keep listening to this hawsome Tina Turner the best. One thing i li- ked about Tina Turner was that every move of her mouth her body moves too. She just sing and dance and that was so great. Tina your the best!!!. And your i really like this album,(Wildest Dreams)."
4,Powerful Tina!,"Go get the american release:Better pictures in the booklet, one extra track (THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US) and a hidden one (an alternate version of SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL REMAINS).The rest is in general what you'd expect from a Tina's album...lots of R'n'B and Rock mixed up to pop success.Whether she covers John Waite's MISSING YOU or UNFINISHED SYMPATHY by Massive Attack, whether she blows you away with an energic WHATEVER YOU WANT (co-written unexpectedly by dance diva Taylor Dayne...) or entices you through the James Bond's theme of GOLDENEYE, whether she sings songs written by The Pet Shop Boys (CONFIDENTIAL), Sheryl Crow (EVERY KINDA PEOPLE) or Brenda Russel (DANCING IN MY DREAMS) she keeps on proving to the audience that she is a living legend in her own right just like Barbra or Cher or Aretha.Thank God for the Tiger of Rock!"
3,Tina's awesome voice is lost in this sea of mediocre pop,"While Tina is one of the most awesome, tireless performers of the last thirty years(if you have seen her live you know what I mean), this set is lacking the edge that made Tina one of my favorites. Her voice is first rate whether she is deep in the drama of ""goldeneye"" or belting out Massive Attacks' ""Unfinished Sympathy"". Other standouts include ""Whatever You Want"" and Something Beautiful Reamins"", however the songs here leave you wishing for something Tina could really sink her voice into. Of course the World Tour proves that even at nearly 60 years old, she continues to sell out major venues, and no matter what her next musical endeavor holds I know it will sell at least one copy :)"
5,a divers dream,this great dvd took me around the world and showed me places in such a realistic and beautiful way that i really want to go see them now. the portait on truk lagoon was especially touching. a must for divers!
2,ok,"ok, but none of these songs are nearly as good as ordinary life on the cruel intentions soundtrack"
4,mixed feelings,"I bought the season beacuse I like the ropic and it's always great to see gay people and stories on screen. I want to support that. That said, I've only watched the first episode so far but I can already tell the acting is pretty bad. Hopefully it gets better as the show prorgresses. It's pretty good for ametuer work, though. And the drama IS intense"
1,"Sailing, Sailing, on an Iceberg too","Wow. This has to be one of the dumbest novels I've ever read. The characters are presented lamely, the story should have been solved days before the Enterprise arrives, and the iceberg....Throughout most of the story Kirk is a Captain. However, for one chapter he becomes and Admiral. Then he is a Captain again.Did you know you can use a tent to turn an iceberg into a sailing ship?The most common reaction to anything by any crew member is to ""gasp"".Vulcan's can't go to cold planets or they will die.Kraken's get goo-goo eyed over communications officers wearing masks.The story consists of Chekov and Uhura running from bad guys, and Kirk and McCoy trying not to drown.I cannot even begin to imagine how drunk the authors had to be to envision this as a good story. I also cannot imagine what publisher would have printed this garbage."
1,dear GOD!,"I feel sorry for anyone using this book in a class environment. I will be using it for kindling after the class, Selvin... I hate you."
3,"Great movie, poor DVD","I hate to disagree with a previous reviewer, but the DVD transfer of this movie is pretty bad. The image is blurry and the sound is poor. I have the VHS version, and after watching the DVD, I played it - and the image quality seemed better than the DVD!It's too bad, because this is one of those ""vengence"" movies that I really like - corny dialog and silly acting included. Love the sword! And of course there's Kathleen Beller in skimpy costumes.I recommend the movie, but if you've got the VHS tape, don't bother with the DVD. I was disappointed with the quality."
4,"Great cheezy fun, but what happened to the sequel?",The end credits promise that Talon will return in Tales of the Ancient Empire... but what happened? Or is this just a joke like the ending of Buckaroo Banzai announcing the sequel: Buckaroo Banzai and the World Crime League?Richard Lynch and Richard Moll give great performances and Lee Horsley as the campy pre-Bruce Cambell meets Errol Flynn manly hero. Excellent soundtrack Awesome 3 bladed projectile broadsword! A guilty childhood pleasure! Thanks for putting this one on DVD Anchor Bay!
3,"A low-budget cheese-fest that's still fun, but also just plain bad in parts!","I think I actually saw this in the theater with my dad when it first came out. Of course, being 13 years old helped! Blades, boobs and the bombastic overacting of Richard Moll as the demonic sorcerer captivated my puberty-addled brain. Now, it has lost much of its initial allure, but still manages to entertain based on the charisma of the two lead actors, and it's sense of tongue in cheek humor.My only real complaint is that the print is quite grainy. A restoration would have been nice, but given the perceived VERY small audience for this DVD purchase, I'm not surprised.Dave S."
4,"Great Book , but not so much for a novice.","I read the back thinking that this would be okay for a novice as it reassured me that ""there's no need to worry, even if you're a relative newcomer to programming...."" But having little programming background myself, I found some of the explanations hard to follow.The examples are great though. This would be a great book if I had some programming knowledge under my belt, but the book should preface that it would be advatageous to have some previous actionscript knowledge."
5,Great Stories,"This book is a grouping of wonderful stories from the southwest: folk songs, folk tales, poetry, fiction, and a section of essays, biography, and history. There is no drama. Biographical sketches and historical and critical notes are intended to provide background, and to aid in understanding and appreciating the selections. Primarily a text, the book may. . . prove interesting to anyone who cares to learn about the Southwest, or who enjoys good reading."
2,"Old Product Great, New Product Uneven & Unavailable","We used to buy this product regularly and noticed during the past year that the quality had become somewhat uneven. The original liners never ripped and the cost was well worth the quality. Now, the liners are unavailable in our local stores in any form. Would be great if the manufacturer would consider reviving the original product."
5,We've tried everything ... this is tops!,"My wife and I have tried just about every recycling contraption and these are about as good as it gets. The color is very pleasing - fits in even in a prominent place. Far better than the outrageous bright blue, orange or ugly green that one normally gets. They are easy to clean and deodorize. They are also the perfect size because their individual bin load is so easy to carry from the house to the trunk to our transfer station and back. We bought two of these towers. So there is always plenty of room when we are serving guests or have stay-overs. We have just purchased a third for my wife's art studio. For those who have tried the ugly plastic route or the canvas bins that are perpetually smelly, you will find these excellent. Several of friends and family have ordered them as well. And, did I mention their customer service? We had a bin damaged at the transfer station. They replaced it with no questions asked in about a week. Very friendly."
2,Disappointing Dime Novel,"If you're a fan of the cool Otto Preminger/Carol Lynley film of the 1960s, you will be colossaly disappointed by this literary version on which it was (very loosely!) based. There are virtually no similarities whatsoever. Now that the movie is on DVD, go directly to that and add it to your library.The novel starts off well, but quickly disintegrated into a convoluted melodrama. It's a shame that the story doesn't live up to the excellent cover art which, ironically, is taken from the far superior film version.The same author wrote the original book version of the great Bette Davis thriller THE NANNY, but I've learned my lesson and won't bother with reading that one!"
5,A Forgotten Classic,"I have to admit to being really, pleasantly surprised at this gem of a hard rock record, which for the most part, was overlooked by many, when it was released. So much better,with a set band in place & not a different player on each track, it seems to have inspired Tipton in the vocals department, so much more than his earlier solo effort- ""Baptism of Fire"", which while a blast musically, made this listener long for the voice of his Priest,bandmate- Rob Halford. For this one he sounds great in the vocals department and his guitar rocks with it's usual brilliance. The songs are good & with the bass thunder of the late, great John Entwistle (The Who, Solo) & the true drumming genius of the late Cozy Powell (Jeff Beck,Rainbow, Whitesnake...), on every track, ""The Edge of The World"" is a must have classic hard rock record & makes me wish this hadn't been a one off, but one of a series of collaberations."
3,Too much salsa,"Only new, unknown musical songs. None of the good, old songs that everybody remembers and love...."
1,buyer be ware,"I had to send back two new decks and then order a used deck because it wasn't coming with the advertised instructions book (used deck came with the instruction book). I don't know if this is just a problem with the batch i was getting or if they no longer print the instruction book with it. And it could have been just random bad luck that amazon sent me two defective decks in a row. If the book isn't important to you don't worry about it. For me, due to the historical significants and the fact that it deviates significantly from modern decks, the instructions were half of the reason i purchased the product."
1,Nonstick Roasting pan,I bought this pan in Nov 2009. It has only been used 6 times and the non stick coating is coming off inside the pan around one of the handles. Pan is useless.
4,I couldn't put this book down,"Silverberg produced a weird, dreamlike feeling of surreality with this book that I found addictive. There was a cloud of doubt over everyone and everything, which kept the pages turning until the end. Highly recommend it."
1,The dregs of science fiction,"This book is a complete waste of time. It's a fast read, but it has no substance. It has no narrative tension. It has no characters. It is a sloppy amalgamation of all the ""telepathy with aliens"" stories every published, written in what is probably supposed to be chic and spare present tense. To be fair, I did enjoy one page of it, in which the aliens join with Noelle's mind, and it is described only in terms of the features of the brain. I found this a very effective narrative device. But the ending is entirely brainless. I plan to try a different Silverberg novel, if I can bring myself to do it."
2,"Unintelligent, soft-core Sci Fi.","I am new to Science Fiction novels and I hope others are better than this. This novel failed to stimulate my mind emotionally, spiritually or intellectually. It should have been entitled ""Adolescent's in Space"". Do yourself a favor and leave this one on the shelf."
2,Not so great!,"I love Melissa & Doug floor puzzles - they are great, durable and fun. I was disappointed with their regular size puzzles. This one and the 200 piece jungle puzzle did not go together well and the pieces are rather thin."
5,Ground Hog tent stakes,Super strong and super light. What else to you need to know about a tent stake?
4,A slacker mystery about finding identity,"A slacker mystery about finding identity. Very natural performances create real, likable people rather than the usual movie caricatures. The mystery evolves mostly credibly with appropriate tension and danger but the ending doesn't quite deliver a satisfying conclusion; close, but not quite."
5,Protector is like riding a roller coaster.,"Military-type books would not have been something I would pick, and had to have been a mistake. A good mistake it turned out to be! It was slow at times, but it needed to be. It was extremely tense at other times; the excitement of what was going to happen next was a bit scary. Good thing I don't have a heart condition since I really got into this book! This was a love story and action-packed with romance as well as on-the-field firepower. Wow!"
2,Proofreader????,"The story and the content were good, but the editing was so horrible it distracted from the story. Honestly, how much could it cost to invest in a proofreader? It makes me not want to read the next in the series, even though I'd really like to."
2,"Adventure, romance or porn?","Adventure was too scarce, romance was yucky and way too long for porn. Total waste of time. Dump this one."
4,Not my usual choice,"Although this was not something I would pick out, and almost decided not to read after I bought it, I'm glad I stuck with it. Turned out pretty god."
2,Not as good as her earlier 2 books,"I seem to be the only person who wasn't impressed with this book. I really, really enjoyed her earlier books, Into Danger and Facing Fear, so I was especially looking forward to The Protector.I never started liking the two leads, and felt the hero had zippo edge and lost interest quickly. Almost 2/3's into book before any real action started, so barely managed to force myself to finish it.Hoping the next installment in the series is back on track!"
4,Good Start To A Series,This is the first book of the Crossfire Series. I had to keep reminding myself this. It was slow in the middle and I was wondering where this book was going. The end was very quick and wasn't always explained very well. I'm making the assumption that it is because things will be explained in the future books. Not sure. I enjoyed the agencies that Ms. Low created and wanted to know more about it. I didn't feel like she fully developed her characters and told me why they were in the relationships and friendships that they were in. I think I'll give her another chance and either read her Virtual series or the second book in this one.
4,Prettiest swing I've ever seen,"Love the looks of this swing--- it's by far, the classiest swing I've seen. All in all it's a great swing-- my only complaint is that the ""nature sounds"" don't sound anything like nature. The music is very nice though."
2,Not a great buy,This is a very pretty swing. The tray is horribly difficult to open. The speed options are good. The music is ok. The problem is the motor keeps dying. I just got a new one from Graco and had it for 2 weeks and it sometimes works and sometimes does not. I'm sending the whole thing back and picking something else.
3,Tamron AF 28-75mm f/2.8,"I really like this lens. I have had some trouble with it, however. Every once in a while it will freeze and give me an F-- error (that is the how the actual error dispalys, I promise! :). I have sent it in to Tamron, and they were very helpful, however, even after getting it back, it will still sometimes give me this error. It is occasional, but when you're just about to get that perfect shot and it happens, it's quite annoying. I would have to say Tamron was easy to deal with and the lens takes excellent pictures. I am happy and would still recommend this product to friends."
3,Tamron AF 28-75 f 2.8,"I bought this lens thinking that an f 2.8 would allow a 28-75 lens to shoot telephoto without flash. It won't, even in sunlight."
5,amazing!,"great lens! so sharp, just amazing! my only problem (which is not really about the lens) is cropping factor, i don't go as wide as 28, because my camera isn't full frame. I used it for portraits, product shots, worked great! 2.8 opening provides incredible depth of field!"
5,Tamron 28-75mm f2.8 XR Di LD Aspherical,"Outstanding lens, incredibly sharp throughout its zoom range, and the f2.8 aperture is fantastic.My only complaint is the cheapish lens hood that comes with it, but for now, it's fine."
2,Cheap Build,I guess you get what you pay for. It takes great pictures but after just 4 months the plastic around the tip of the lens cracked. Now the hood doesn't fit on properly.
4,Awesome,"For the price, you cannot beat this lens. It does react slower than my Canon L series lenses, but you get used to the timing when photographing sports"
2,All pictures were blury. It had trouble with focus.,"I bought this lens and after a week returned it because of the poor quality. It had difficulty focusing. Three different times my camera locked up with a busy message when trying to focus. All of my pictures turned out blury and out of focus. The pictures were taken at 2.8 ISO 100 with a high shutter speed on a bright and sunny day. I expect some blur with 2.8, but I always point the focus dot in the corner of the eyes so I would expect at least the eye to be sharp. I ended up taking the lens off and using my $100.00 50mm which far outperformed the Tammy.My advice: Save your money until you can afford the Canon 17-55 or 28-105. You'll be replacing this lens within a year if you buy it."
1,R2D2 in HEAT!,I must have received a bad copy as this thing sounded like one of the Transformers while trying desperately to auto focus on something. So loud it was embarrassing! It was also extremely cheap feeling and It was only sharp at F8. A real JUNKER!!!
5,Just What I needed.,"I needed a mid range f/2.8 zoom and checked out a bunch of them before purchasing this Tamron.The lens is extremely sharp and the f/2.8 speed is just what I needed for stage and concert photography. It focuses fast, and never misses a lick.Other than saying that I am more than happy what else is there?"
4,a great value for money,"I love the f2.8 as it allows me to shoot under low light condition. As in autofocus speed, some people say it doesn't do as fast and as quietly as Sigma but I don't find it as a problem since the pictures that I take are family events, moreover for the 1/2 of Sigma's price, it's a great lens for the money.One suggestion that I could make for the manufacturer, maybe for the future models they could consider adding optical stabilizer / vibration reduction feature."
2,Operation Valkyrie - Documentary,"I found the video to be questionable. The speaker kept pronouncing Franz Halder's name Hadler. In one of the scenes, depicting the invasion the the USSR, one of the German soldiers was carrying a Panzerfaust anti-tank weapon. The Germans seemingly began developing these weapons in 1942--a year after the invasion of the USSR. These items may seem picky, but if this is a documentary, they should have done a better job getting the details correct. It only took viewing half of the video once to find these mistakes."
5,one of a kind,"This CD rocks!!!! The collaboration of different musical influences, it just flows together. This is a cd to chill to and to listen to everyday!!"
5,you've got 2 love these guys,"I have had the dead letters album for a few months now and i don't think hardly a day goes past where i do not listen to this album. They truly are fabulous! So all of you people who haven't got this yet...GO GET IT!! Their other albums are also very good, into, peep etc. Also an excellent band to see live (as i found out on monday 1st nov. The place was jumping!!)SO PEOPLE GET YOUR WALLETS OUT AND HELP THIS BAND MAKE IT REALLY BIG. THEY DESERVE ALL THE ATTENTION WE CAN GIVE THEM..."
5,Christmas Vacation Soundtrack,I ordered this soundtrack and I am very happy with my purchase. Soundtrack is perfect! It is totally legit. I would highly recommend ordering the soundtrack if you love Christmas Vacation as much as I do. You won't be disappointed.
3,Not so Complete,"""Nannies & More"" provides basic and realistic information on establishing and maintaining relationships with household help based on the author's previous experience as owner of a domestic employment agency in Arizona. The work appears to rely solely on this experience, spending an undue amount of space on anecdotes.Be aware, there are no references to web sites, none. The book is dated or lacking specifics in several areas, i.e. availability of background checks, IRS matters.If you are new to the role of employer (or have had negative experience in the past) the book provides a good primer, and mirror for contemplating your expectations of possible employees and your approach to them."
3,Something for Everyone,I read the other reviews and have to agree that this book was quite enjoyable. I suggested it to a friend and was happy she enjoyed it as much as I did. It's definitely an original story and the relationship situations the characters go through are relateable. Roland and Elise's relationship is one many women could relate to and learn from about settling for what you got instead of going for what you want and the cost of doing that. There is definitely something in this book for everyone. You won't be dissapointed.
5,Get This Now.,"This is a fantastic cd. Very rhythmic, melodic and deep. Very jazzy house with some loungy tracks thrown in. Excellent song structure. Even though the title suggest unreleased material the songs sound very polished. I highly recommend this release."
5,This is a great feeder for tall dogs,I have a 6-month old lab puppy. He has outgrown his last food dish. I really like this one. He doesn't have to lean over to eat or drink. The stainless steal bowls are easy to keep clean.
5,Great for Puppies through Adulthood!,"This will be the second ""Big Dog Feeder"" we have purchased.The first one we purchased 10-years ago for our Golden Retriever which is still in use today.We purchased our second ""Big Dog Feeder"" for our new puppy who right now is using it with the legs off.This feeder is perfect for our Golden's and helps keep their head level while eating which is better for the digestive system with less gas build up.We highly recommend this product to any Golden Retriever owner"
3,"Good for a really, really big dog","We bought this for our Black Lab, but seemed to be too tall for our dog. The bowls are really big, and could hold far more food than our dog required. This product itself seemed to be constucted well, although it would have been nice if the legs had come pre-weighted, instead or requiring kitty litter or some other material to weight the feeder down."
1,Junk quality BOOTLEG,"Don't be fooled: this is a garbage-quality DVD-R bootleg, ""mastered"" from the old VHS. I know people are desperate to see this great, great film in the digital format (obviously I'm a big fan myself), but be patient and DON'T waste your money."
5,Wetsuit with great fit,"Fits like a (full-body) glove. I'm 5'11, 175 pounds and glad I got the Large size, as it is perfectly snug - the Medium would have been way too tight. As is, I can wear this thing while cycling to the beach, go swimming, and be comfortable the whole time. This isn't going to keep you from feeling cold when you hit the water, but it lets you warm up over time. It is also really bouyant, so I can go kayaking and worry less about wearing a personal flotation device. Finally, the price is great."
5,great product!,"I bought this wetsuit last week and eagerly awaited its arrival. It was worth the wait; I've used it almost every night since I received it and its been extremely comfortable and effective. I'm also glad i listened to the reviews that said it fits small, because I'm about 5'11"" 165 pounds but I bought a large and it fits perfectly."
3,Runs small...,"I bought this almost a year ago. Its good for the price. Only problem is that it runs small. I'm 5'7"" and i weight 170 pounds. When i bought it i was like 165 and was going for the medium size but i saw a review that said that it runs small. So i got the medium/large and to my surprise it did run small. Unless you are really thin for your height, go for a bigger size."
3,Size is an issue,"This is my first wet suit. I am 59 years old 5'8"" 180 lbs. I first ordered the large and could barely zip it up. I returned it and ordered an extra large. this one fits much better. I plan to try a triathalon and I bought it to give me added boyancy for the open water swim. I've tried it in an indoor pool and so far I like it. I believe with this wet suit I will have the courage to give it a try."
3,Orded a shorty wetsuit... But get a full one,"The suit itself is pretty good. But what I ordered is the SHORTY one, (short sleeve and short pants), but what I really got today is a FULL one... (like this: http://www.amazon.com/U-S-Divers-Mercury-Adult-Wetsuit/dp/B000EOVA5Q/ref=pd_sim_sg_3 , but not exactly the same). :P"
4,Great for price,"Awesome WetSuit for the price. If one is planning to use this wetsuit in chilly water, this suit will do the work perfectly. If you are planning on using it in COLD water.. you might wanna invest some more money and step up the game."
2,"Quality good, size too small, size specification incorrect","I was planning to put my laptop under this monitor stand (in its docking station with lid closed) to free up desk space.My laptop is 13.75 inches wide. The description says the monitor stand is 16.3 x 12.6 inches, but actual dimensions are 15.7 x 11.7 inches. When assembled, space between the legs under there is 11.65 inches -- not wide enough to fit a laptop unless it's small.Construction is sturdy; fit and finish are acceptable. Assembly is easy. My complaint is the misleading size specification."
5,Sr chief joe,Gary has never dissapointed; but this his finest effort start to finish in a while. Gary is the best!!!!
3,Average,"I bought this after buying Bad for You Baby and was kind of disappointed. It's got some good songs and I especially like the steel guitar work on track 9, but many of the songs are average and forgettable to me."
5,Testosterone Blues,"This is the best guitarist playing the blues today. The former guitarist for Thin Lizzy, Gary Moore broke out on his own with some heavy-metal albums (yes, albums), that may have gotten little public notice, but are, non-the-less, underground thrash classics today. He broke into the blues with ""Still Got the Blues"" and actually broke into popular music rotation of big FM radio stations.Since then he has experimented, done some fantastic stuff (""A Different Beat"" comes to mind), but he always comes back to the blues.And he is the only one that comes close to playing the blues with the passion and verve that Stevie Ray Vaughn brought to the genre."
5,"This is about as ""close as you get""","This is a truly great album. Belfast-born Gary Moore has excelled even himself with this assorted collection of new tunes and old blues classics. Perhaps one of the most underrated of today's guitarists, this album is a superb display of Gary's talents, both in terms of technical brilliance and his incredible 'feel' for blues guitar. The covers of John Mayall's ""Have You Heard"" (About My Baby), Son House's ""Sundown"" and Leroy Carr's (In the) ""Evenin'"" are particular stand-outs.If you're a blues fan of good taste and particularly if you don't know Gary Moore, buy this CD and you will thoroughly enjoy it."
5,About aikon,"I am Japanese and I enjoy this series very much in Japanese. I hope you enjoy them, too.The translation is very good, but I would like to comment about word ""aikon"". This is mistake of Japanese character reading. This should be ""Gou-Kon"", shortening word of ""Goudou-Konpa(Company)"". I wounder why tranlator don't use Japanese reviewer before publishing.And page 181, explanation of nabe. This text is same as ""Japanese department store"" on volume 1 page 184. This is simple mistake. Nabe means one kind of food cooked and served with hot pan."
5,Excellent Thermostat,"I have been using one of these to control a wood furnace for several years now, and there is simply nothing better for the job. Prior to this I had tried several other thermostats including a standard Honeywell Round, but none of them controlled the furnace with any accuracy at all (2-4 degree temp swing). This thermostat with it's excellent 'Heat Anticipator' Circuit controls the wood furnace with no more than a 1 degree of temperature swing (unless you over-fire it of course). I am getting ready to install electric radiant floor heat on an inclosed porch, and this is the only thermostat that I am even considering using."
3,"Nothing special, can't recommend it","The light is bright, but the beam has an odd pattern of vertical stripes that makes it hard to see anything. The bracket is too small for the handle bars on my road bike (about 32mm)."
5,Excellent Bicycle Light,"I bought this light for use on my scooter and bicycle. It uses 4 AA batteries and produces an excellent pattern of light that is designed well for use on a bicycle. Because of the reflector design, the light provides excellent light ahead of you, but also provides good light almost directly below the light as well.I recommend using Eneloop low-discharge rechargeable NiMH AA batteries, which have a 1-year shelf life after charging."
1,Does not work on Vista 64 bit,Well I do not know how this game plays because it crashes sometimes in the game menu or about 5 minutes into the game. There are no patch fixes out that I can find for this.
3,critique,It is a bit dated and yet still relevant to today's market. OK but not one of the best books I have read.
2,Whatever,It didn't do anything for me. I like psychology books but I didn't really like this one. Someone else might find it useful.
3,under evaluation,"Have not read the book much yet, but everytime I do read in it there are lots of practical and common sense applications."
5,Easy and IT WORKS,"We have an 1800 sq one story house and for some reason unknown reason there is interference all over the place. (Even AT&T provided us with a Micro Cell for free because of unexplained dropped calls) We had an existing 1-Port Net Gear Ethernet Adapter and purchased the 4-Port. Plugged in the TV and Apple TV and it works unlike the connection has ever worked before! We have FIOS and the Actiontec router is not so great but everything is running beautifully now. We used Apple TV to test the connection and it passed. I haven't tested the speed yet, but it's way better than anything else that we have tried including the Hawking booster."
3,Works but slow,"I bought 2 on refurb to connect Xbox/PC to home network in different room. The connection was easy (make sure to plug directly in to wall outlet, not through surge protector). It is just a bit too slow to stream HD video content.Recommendation: get at least 200MBs. The technology is great - this is just too slow for large files or HD streaming."
5,Works as advertised,"This was truly plug and play. I connected one of the units to the router and plugged the second one in upstairs in our single family home and connected 2 PCs and an internet phone to the switch. It worked immediately with no configuration necessary.As other reviewers have noted, the LEDs are quite bright, but we have the units on a socket underneath a table so it's not noticeable. I'm sure newer units are faster than this, but it works fine for us and it is an improvement over our WIFI, even though we had a repeater upstairs to boost the signal, it didn't always work reliably. This is a vast improvement."
1,I love Henkes other books but this one really is awful,"After reading and falling in love with Henkes' other books (Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse, Chrysanthemum, etc.) I expected to love this one as well. The other negative reviewers aren't being overly-sensitive. This book is AWFUL. The things the older sister whispers into her little brother's crib are downright horrifying. This book goes beyond simply showing the reality of childhood cruelty into the realm of normalizing sick and disturbed hatred. I started reading this book to the 4 year old boy that I nanny for and had to stop in the middle of it. He has two older sisters and the thought that he would assume this is what his sisters thought about him when he was born breaks my heart. Do your family a favor and do not buy this book, spend your time reading his other fabulous books instead."
3,not happy,"Product works...Except it works way toooo well, differently than anticipated.Product description was very lacking and did not make clear the actual speed of the jiggle.Therefore when the item was tested it was constantly moving the mouse.Nothing in the descriptions made it clear for the mj-1 or mj-2 what to know about it.Thus the conclusion had to be drawn perhaps the second version might be better.Little did I learn the mj-2 was of slightly different design and purpose.For the need of moving every 20 seconds would have been the right speed.This speed, apparently, is employed in the mj-1 version.Conclusion, make the descriptions completely clear of their potential use and speeds.Product provider is in contact, so perhaps I can get the device traded for."
2,Don't buy if you own a Mac,My wife and I were very satisfied with this printer until we upgraded our Mac to OS X 10.5 (Leopard). The printer will not print since that time. Lexmark does not acknowledge that there is a problem. Mac users - google for this printer and you will see many complaints about Leopard problems. I wish we could return this printer.
2,Big Brother's printer using ingrained sabotage,"This printer eats print cartridges that cost too much and need frequent replacing. Even before the ink is barely used, it keeps putting up screens that it is running out soon and a tab to buy ink from them. I finally tired of the cost and bought ink elsewhere, now it refuses to recognize it has full ink cartridges, and every time I print anything it lies about being out of ink and I have to click off two screens that interfere with printing. I will buy another brand of printer rather than give in to their Big Brother tactics."
2,not big enough for my digital camera & dock (kodak),"Not big enough to hold my LS443 kODAK DIGITAL CAMERA & All theacessories that I need to carry with. It looks big in thepicture,but actual size does not.I GIVE IT A TWO STARS"
2,"Over Hyped CD, But Still Solid","Paul Brown is a tremendously talented artist and producer with a wonderful engineering background that allows him to set the standard in smooth jazz for clean production and versatile music. However, content on his latest project, ""White Sand"" isn't musically expressive as the content heard on his first two solo albums. The artist collaborations on ""White Sand"" make it tempting to purchase, but you quickly realize Brown's musical wittiness and versatility (Smooth, Latin or R&B) are lacking. Overall it is still a CD worth paying for."
4,"Good, but should come with a lid","Pyrex has two different lines, Serveware and Storageware, that really should be combined. This is a nice-looking bowl and it works fine for heating in the microwave before serving. It works fine in the refrigerator, too, but it doesn't come with a lid; you need to add disposable plastic wrap. Since the sides are tapered you can stack multiple bowls in little cupboard space.Pyrex's Storageware is a line of plain glass bowls (with mostly straight sides) that come with lids. They work fine for heating in the microwave before serving, and work just as well in the refrigerator, too, because they come with lids. They're not as attractive as the Serveware products on the table, but I often use them there because they're more versatile. Because the sides don't taper much they don't stack very efficiently in your cupborads.With a lid, this bowl would rate 5 stars. It gets 4 from me without a lid."
5,CHANGING FACES,"""Changing Faces"" is straight R&B which I think is lacking in most so-called R&B music today. These are two beautiful women with beautiful voices who have everthing it takes for longevity in the music industry. Continued success."
3,"Keep it slow, ladies...","This album was released during an era where slow jams were in and giving up-tempo R&B flavor a try was also in. Like many of their counterparts during that time, the pretty ladies of Changing Faces needed to realize their strength in ballads and avoided trying any up-tempo material. However, there are a couple of good tunes on this album, particularly the slow jam, ""All Is Not Gone"", where sorrow and regret serves as a theme for a song that was definitely written with the intent of winning over ones with heartbreaks in their history. R. Kelly-produced hit ""Stroke You Up"" was a radio smash, but the lyrics weren't exactly poetic or articulate. But, it's still a popular track that may bring back some old school nostalgia for some of you."
3,"""Can I stroke you up!""","This cd was pretty good when it came out. The only hit, that I can remember, was the joint with R. Kelly talking about can I stroke you up. Anyway, it's ok I would not suggest purchasing it though. Download the song on Itunes and save your money. NEOSOUL06."
1,poor explanation and trick picture,"i was very displeased with this product, i honestly thought i was getting a light fixture instead i got pieces of glass or something, the picture tricked me into purchasing this product, it was just a waste of my time ,wait and money i feel as though i was robbedKichler Lighting 4802WH Tularosa Outdoor Wall Mount Dark Sky Panel Insert Set, White"
2,"Just The Basics, Ma'am","After fooling around with GarageBand for a month I was hoping to find a book of ""tricks and tips"" to further my exploration. Unfortunately this book isn't it -- it covers just the entry-level instructions I'd already figured out.Maybe the authors knew more than they're telling, but there's nothing in this book which couldn't be gleaned from reading the help files."
5,Brilliance is the word that comes t o mind,"Now understand that I've always been a Vince fan...since the beginning. I love his music and have bought every one of his releases. There's never been, and never will be, another voice like Vince Gill's. Having said that, I wasn't sure about the 4-disc idea. I love Vince but even I wasn't certain I could listen to that much of him at one time. I shouldn't have worried!!! Like someone said in another review, I can't stop listening. This isn't music you can or should want to walk away from listening to as much and as often as you can. It makes me happy, it lifts me up, it makes me smile and it makes me wonder to myself how one single person can have so much talent, integrity and passion and also have THAT amazing voice. The solo tracks are amazing, the pairings are magical, and each disc takes you on a different journey. This whole set is beyond compare in my opinion. Give one to everyone you love."
4,Like a string of pearls.......,"I have to choose 4 stars, I'm alone out here on the limb, but here is my reason. My friend Taj Mahal once said to me after completion of a Grammy winning album... 'you have to lay the tracks down like a string of pearls'.I would have liked the songs a bit more on the 'mix it up' side. I wish I had a 6 CD changer in my car so I could do a 'random' setting, I find the CD begins to sound like one long song.I agree that he can do jazz and honky tonk without skipping a beat and the man can sing.... maybe I just don't get it......."
5,Great Range of Music and Presentation,"Vince Gill shows an extremely vast range of talents from writing to producing and, of course, singing the mixed musical bouquet he has presented on this set of CDs. The artists he has invited to this are there to provide a complement to his voice and the song's message and style that works and the blend is excellent. Love Bekka Bramlett!! That beautiful woman can sing a song!!! Great set of 4 CDs for a long car trip."
5,Vince Gill - This Collection is Just Great,"Have just receivd this 4 CD SetNo lollipop hereGreat lyrics - great musicStill listening, will add more as I get into it more."
4,Just about it...,"Like Jane Wiedlin but never really that impressed with Fur or Tangled? Kissproof World may be more of what you are looking for from this tiny voiced ex-Go-Go. A much more satisfying effort this time around, Wiedlin seems to have found her place away from Go-Go land...but not too far. Definitely has a similar feel, but there's more growth here as a solo act than with her earlier efforts. Notables include ""Die Now! Pay Later!"", ""My Lovely Revenge"", and ""Be My Muse"". Perhaps the best track on the whole thing is ""Sooner or Later"". The tunes are catchy, and that's not a bad thing considering the clog of Rap and moaning ballads on the radio today. Jane Wiedlin will never be mainstream or get the radio play that some of these songs may deserve, but she does serve up a refreshing treat."
4,For ballet aficionados,"My wife and I see many ballet videos. This was good, but not among the very best. It makes clear that a ballet dancer must have an obsession with the art since it is so demanding and painful. Also, there is the excitement of competition and the dancers afre very likable."
2,"Muy buen precio, pero por que?",La verdad es que despues de utilizarlos unas cuantas veces pierden su encanto y creo que la medida esta un poco fuera de orden. Si no te importa lo que te pones te recomiendo que los compres.
1,Silly and superficial,"Yes, it was fun to read about other people's experiences. But I didn't find this book helpful at all in regards to organization and planning. It's basicially just a lot of tidbits from all sorts of people."
5,A mover's Bible!!!,"I've moved more than the average person - both long-distance and across town and within the same building. I will soon be leaving my own house and moving to smaller quarters and this terrific book will help greatly.There were so many new suggestions, each easy to understand but never before known to me. My reactions were: of course, wow! why didn't I think of that? How much simpler than my method, etc.Anyone moving will benefit from these ideas, all of which are helpful and not a single one that I disagree with."
2,decent,"eh..i've had this cd since it came out and i just can't get into it. i liked the first skinlab album, and the second wasn't too bad, but i'm not a fan of this album at all. some of the songs kick..., but i don't remember which ones. this won't be spending too much time in my cd player. start with bound gagged and blindfolded."
5,A not-so-futuristic apocalypse,"Black/Red/White (The Circle Trilogy) by Ted Dekker certainly needs no applause from me, but I'm giving it anyway. WOW. Frightening to see how the end of humankind could so easily happen. These are very well done, fast paced, twisty-turny, and just when I'd think, ""What next??"" well, Mr. Dekker would certainly show me. It's a story of redemption, but not gushing with theology. It's a not-so-futuristic apocalyptic story as well as a spear & sword adventure tale, woven seemlessly together. This is an amazing tale and I'm hungry now for ""Green"". And the ""Lost"" books. And the Paradise novels. And..."
1,thumbs down,well i thought it was a comic because the peview showed a comic i want the comic!!! seriously i mean come on show the product not the comic!
3,Custom bumper sticker not too durable,"This bumper sticker, made to order, was printed on fairly durable adhesive backed paper. It held up for about three years. When it was time to remove it, it did not come off cleanly, as vinyl stickers do. If you want a custom bumper sticker, I recommend trying to find a source that guarantees easy removal.But I said what I wanted to for several years, and can live with the extra work of removal."
4,Nice collection of shorts on CD-ROM,"This brings together quite a few complete shorts (over 46 minutes) on a single CD for Windows PC or MAC (or a newer DVD player that's compatible). ""Beautifully rotoscoped animations."""
2,not worth the money,Several people in my class have this and thought it was great. All this contains are sketchy outlines of the chapters and a quick review test. For the money the online class that corresponds with this text is a much better value. For me this book was a complete waste of money.
5,"This has Cool, Considerate men","""Cool, Considerate men"" was dropped from the theatrical and most DVD releases. I can see why it was dropped, but it's very nice to have it here on this new extended Directors cut DVD.Altho there are several minor inaccuracies (mostly done to cut things down, Sam Adams was conflated into John Adams, his brother for example) it is still a great way of getting people into the Founding Fathers and early American history.For that, it's great for the younger set, altho it is rated PG (slight use of profanity, some adult double-entendres) . I think it should be required watching.The music is fabulous, the singing is good and the acting is excellent."
5,It's a masterpiece I say,"Easily one of the top ten musicals of all time. In addition to that, it's a darn good play. The authors might tweak the facts a bit here and there, but it's still one of the best historical movies I've ever seen.If only Ken Burns could be this entertaining...I'm not even going to try to describe it. Rent it yourself next July and live the adventure."
4,A Fun Historical Movie With Too Much Bubblegum,"I was not too sure if I should give this movie 3 or 4 stars...1776 is the tale of the Declaration Of Independence as seen through the eyes of John Adams (second president of the USA) or someone who is very much like him. It is a fun and at times silly presentation done in the ""old musical"" style.I first saw 1776 when I was in Junior High School and was immediately taken by the amount of effort put into making a collection of 13 colonies into a nation. The efforts of men such as Ben Franklin and John Adams can not be understated.This movie is fun and indeed is (mostly) historically correct.The frivolity of a musical was detracting for me and some of the score was not so hot, some songs were good, but dated sounding.Still all in all a very good movie and one I enjoyed for what it is. If working with kids it might be good to start off with this movie and then buy the three tape Liberty series from PBS to fill in the blanks with more depth and true history."
4,Restored 1776 deserves 5 stars!,"One of the best ""Broadway to Hollywood"" transfers, terribly underated during its original release. It seems impossible, but everything works in this enjoyable musical concerning the events surrounding the writing and signing of the Declaration of Independance.Great ensemble performances. Even the somewhat silly songs ring true. However, the version to see is director Peter Hunt's original preview cut which runs almost 40 minutes longer than the currently available pan/scan mono tape. It restores the great COOL COOL CONSERVATIVE MEN sequence along with several other scenes. COME ON COLUMBIA HOME VIDEO, GIVE US THE ""TRUE"" 1776!!! That is the version which rates 10 stars in my opinion!!!"
5,Delightful and Compelling,"Exceptionally entertaining and clever presentation of the near insurmountable tasks that faced framers of the Declaration of Independence. I would not have believed a musical like this could be made. Wonderful, watch it every 4th of July."
5,Skillful adaptation of a most creative Broadway Musical.,"The hit Broadway Musical is transferred to film with great skill. Daniels is a perfect John Adams, the stereo tickles the ear, and this is a longer version that what I saw on TV. This complete edition delights. How anyone ever conceived that the writing of the Declaration of Independence could be made into a musical amazes me, but make it they did, and it is magical."
1,Zero value - Why remove gender altogether?,"This books claims that saying ""good morning boys and girls"" is on par with making a racist comment. This is simply ludicrous as are many of the assertions made in this book. This books represents why our education system is broken. There is less focus on education and much more on socialization of students."
3,Interesting photo book,"The book has interesting pictures of Ft. Story and the area, but like most of the books in this series when they are related to a military installation there is usually not a great deal of information on the military aspects. I can not say the photos are not interesting, it is just that when the title and cover gives the impression it is going to be a military history type book they should include more military related photos and even descriptions."
5,little switches,these are magnetic reed switches that turn sound equipment on my grandsons lionel trains. i think there great
2,Not like it,"I wont' go detailing what I didn't like it. I do like Gary Oldman so far, and some others actors, but acting was really ... what to say, even bad doesn't give justice, because I think is not their fault really, I think they were miscast first, second the story have a very lame dialogue at times. I wanted to be a little bit darker.. I don't know, kind of Sleepy Hollow, but many of the actors are already known for not being really good, and others were to shallow. I didn't enjoyed."
2,Very Disappointing,"There were a lot of reasons I should have loved this movie. I like nontraditional takes on classic fairy tales, like Once Upon a Time and the 10th Kingdom, but I really didn't care for this movie at all. I also usually the love the cast, but they were horrible in this movie. It was almost painful to watch. The only reason it got two stars instead of one is because despite it's flaws, there was something about it that had me watch the entire thing."
4,A Werewolf is in the Hood,"OverviewThis film draws strongly from a wintry atmosphere, and the chills crawl as the snow gently falls and caresses the wilderness medieval setting. Gary Oldman puts in a great performance as a religious werewolf hunter of sorts. (Reminds me of Van Helsing). However, this movie rolls out with less action, but builds more on mystery and romance.Pros- Strong suspense. A werewolf is living within their midst.- Good Cinematography. Nice selection of scenes.- Nice costumes and set designsCons- Gothic romance seems a little overdone. Love triangle lacks chemistry- Storyline seems a bit nave when the villagers proceed to celebrate, in spite of being given substantial information that the werewolf is still alive. (seems to be a bit like Beowulf)ConclusionNot a bad show to watch on a very cold evening."
3,Red Riding Hood DVD,I absolutely loved this movie except for one thing.... It opened to a beautiful wintery scene and I soon found myself wrapped up in the life of red riding hood and trying to figure out the mystery of the wolf- all while pulling for true love to somehow find a way to make it through impossible circumstances.... that is until in the middle of this otherwise wonderful movie someone is tortured. And that is what ruined it for me. Unfortunately that one part was horrible enough for me not to purchase this movie or ever watch it again.
4,Old School Story With A New Twist,"I first saw this movie a couple of years ago and finally decided to add it to my collection. If your not familiar with this film it's about a town that made a packed with a werewolf and for years things have been going as well as could be expected until the wolf changes the rules by killing ""Red's"" older sister. I liked this film because it was different from most werewolf movies as the main female charcature ""Red"" was underplayed by Amanda Seyfried so the viewer wasn't just thinking don't go in the woods. This is a combination love story, creature film, and whodonit, I think it would have done much better on it's original releas if it wasn't lost during the ""Twilight"" hype. IMHO It is a much better film than any of the twilight films because it has a more adult theme, it's not filled with graphic gore and has an old school feel."
4,Red Riding Hood,"Well I loved it. The retelling of an old story. I wasn't expectingthe romance but I was pleased by the young actors in their roles.Gary Oldman, as always, steals the scenes he is in. This filmemphasizes the villian as a werewolf, and not as a mere wolf, whichpleases me. That poor wolf is always getting a bad wrap."
2,Damage packaging,I ordered this movie as a gift to my family and there is a puncture threw the back of the case. I haven't opened it as I don't have time to re order before Christmas. I also was asked to rate the order a day before it even showed up at the house. Not very prompt on the shipping this time around
4,I enjoyed it,"It is a mystery story. Like many mysteries, a little hard to follow at times. But it does its job and keeps you guessing."
2,ok,while this movie is prettty good this particular blu ray looks like the picture on front was badly redone and badly printed. i would buy this same movie from someone else!
3,A 'Twilight' Twist to a Classic Fairy Tale!!!,"To be honest, I was never really a big fan of the 'Little Red Riding Hood' story, but I grew up with the story because of Faerie Tale Theatre. Because of Twilight, everything you see nowadays is ridiculous women falling in love with vampires and now werewolves. They figured they may as well use it with Classic Fairy Tale stories. (In fact, Catherine Hardwicke who directed the original Twilight also directed this movie!) It's getting out of control, next Goldilocks is gonna fall in love with a sparkly grizzly bear!Amanda Seyfried stars as Valerie/Red Riding Hood who lives in the small village of Daggerhorn. She is in love with Peter, but betrothed to Henry (Edward/Jacob) Soon, a werewolf comes to town and tries to get Valerie to come with it. She is the only one that can understand it. Father Solomon comes to town and takes control of everything and tries to kill the werewolf by any means necessary. I probably wouldn't recommend RED RIDING HOOD!!!"
1,Worst Movie Yet,"Sometimes you see a film that you know will be mediocre, yet you hope to at least be vaguely entertained by it. This was not one of those films. Catherine Hardwicke did an abhorrent job directing and her name is now forever burnt in my memory, as someone whose films I won't touch with a ten foot pole. Every flat line of dialogue, every awkward attempt at acting and transitions smooth enough to bear semblance to a screeching pile of metal junk make you flinch and regret minutes of life wasted. A laughable, painful to watch piece of garbage that I recommend you pass, no matter your afflictions in the cinematic arts."
4,It wasn't incredibly memorable but worth watching!,I liked the choice of characters and the wolf was a true surprise for myself but it wasn't a movie I'd have to have. I was happy with the film and I'd reccomend it but any further it's a must see once type of movie!
2,Dull,"The book was much much better. The acting in the film seemed shallow and the first half of the movie was a bore fest. It almost seemed as if the actors were not really into acting this all out either, yes they all came to play it out...but emotionally, they were vacant.The last half of the movie seemed that the actors redeemed themselves; however, the wolf was hilariously computery looking and looked more like an old Nintendo graphic rather than something from a 2011 werewolf movie.This movie will not make it to my video library, but the book is here and I will read that again and again!;-)"
2,Eh. Not the best movie.,"The reason I give this movie two stars is because it was over the top with the violence. Someone getting killed every 10/20 minutes. That was very tiring. It was good though because the ending was a complete surprise for the audience. I like Amanda Seyfried, but she disappointed me in this movie. The plot line was interesting but the way Catherine Hardewick directed it, made it not great."
2,Red Riding Staring contest,"The scenery in the movie is stunning. Absolutely jaw dropping stunningly beautiful. The movie is shot very clearly and vividly. And then that's where all the good ends. Most of the time the characters are staring at each other. We see Valerie's red almost crying eyes every 5 minutes of the movie. She does have lovely eyes but it seems that is what the movie boiled down to. Who can stare at each other the longest. I really wanted to enjoy this movie but it did not go anywhere. The trailers built this way up, so it was just a huge let down for me."
2,Yawn!!!,Not very interesting plot. Nice photographic FX. I am disturbed by the underlying message of this children's story warped to celebrate evil.
1,Not worth your time...,"Five minutes into this movie and I wished I'd spent my money on something else. The dialogue is bland and tedious and the directing horrific. Despite the cast (Gary Oldman, Amanda Seyfried etc.) the emotional depth of the characters never go beyond the surface. Last time I'll watch a movie by this director."
2,Advertising for businesses,"I ordered this card set before going to Paris, thinking it would save weight vs. carrying books. Not really--it's relatively heavy. Most disappointing was that the cards primarily promoted businesses on the routes--recommending this restaurant or that store--much less on the sights to see. I had to wonder if the businesses listed had paid for the mentions, there were so many. I have a friend going to Paris next year, and I did not bring these home for her to use, just left them at the hotel. I cannot recommend this item."
2,Can you say ...-off!,"This CD does not inform that these are NOT the original recordings made by Roy Orbinson, but some later re-recordings of his most famous hits. Obviously, they dont hold a candle to the originals, and are just above average performances. Buy any other compilation first, I recommend the Rhino one."
2,Flawed Game,"There are so many matching games out there, but I always loved the duck game at the fare and so do my kids. That is why I chose this one, but I found some issues right away. This game is simple and easy enough for little ones to play. It teaches matching and also shape recognition. The flaws are that you will never get this back in the box after opening it because of the way it is packed at the factory. You have to store the little ducks somewhere else. This toy is also really loud and incessant. It annoys even my 4-year-old."
2,The quacking of the ducks,Why must so many childrens' games be so loud and annoying? Great game sans the quacking of the ducks... quacking of the ducks.... quacking of the ducks.
2,"Good book, but poorly assembled","While the content of the book does have some value, I was disappointed in how the book was put together. Rather than being printed on typicaly ""book"" quality paper and professionally bound, the book I received was printed single-sided on printer paper and comb-bound with a plastic comb piece. I figure that for the cost I paid for the book, I should get something that looks nicer and will last a while."
5,I love knitting with beads!,I found this book the be the best written and easiest to follow of the knitting with bead books I have. I have made the purse on the cover at least a half dozen times and it is much easier than it looks. The projects are easy enough and can be varied with your own imagination. It's a wonderful book.
3,knitting with beads,"I guess I was expecting something a little different. Nice patterns, although most are not to my bohemian taste.If you are a traditional type pattern knitter, this is a great book for you!"
2,pliner,"I ordered this shoe and had to return it. order at least 1 size larger, and check out the footbed, it doesn't fit my feet. It's like a birkenstock foot bed"
2,relaxation tape at best,"Again, I bought another audiovisual product about Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and I was highly disappointed. This is an okay relaxation tape, but there are a million of these on the market! It only gives you a brief summary of what PTSD is, and then teaches some relaxation techniques that really can be used for any type of stress. I feel like I wasted my money again! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. If you are just looking for a way to relax your muscles and relieve stress, I'm sure there are better tapes out there. Again, the tape doesn't really delve into PTSD, a horrible disorder!! I'm still looking for some good information about this mental illness, but yet to find any!!:("
3,Handy But......,"I really like the concept of the dispenser, however when I load more soda in the top rack the edges are sharp and not much room for your fingers for easy release of the cans causing them to turn sideways in the rack. I also had to modify the back part where the cans go from the top to the bottem, I was having a problem with the cans falling out of the rack and going behind my upright freezer which was not fun pulling out to retreive the cans. I was luck that none of the cans exploded when they fell. But like I said I am enjoying the fact that I can now see when we are getting low and being able to just keep putting more sodas in the dispenser without waiting till the box was empty."
1,Don't waste your money,"I had high hopes for this, but it's really a waste of money. The wire framing that it is made of is crooked and the cans don't load or ""flow"" correctly. They are always getting stuck in the back. It's substandard workmanship and quality is everything we have come to expect from cheap stuff from China. Again, save your money."
5,"Fast, Cheap, Dependable","I bought this simpletech card after a very dissapointing exeperience with a 128 MB lexar card (the red labled one). The lexar was very slow in both picture taking and picture review modes on my Canon s200 Digital Elph.This card is much faster then the above mentioned lexar card, and has proven to work pefectly in my camera. It is also one of the cheapest cards on the market, albiet prices are dropping everyday, so its hard to make such a sweeping statement.If you own a Canon camera, and want a good, cheap, fast, dependable CF card, then the simpletech is a very good choice. Also keep in mind that simpletech cards come with a lifetime warranty versus limited year warranties of some other makers. This made me feel a bit better when purchasing such an inexpensive card."
3,Avoid this CF card if you have a Nikon,I have a Coolpix 4300. This CF card runs just fine but it is slower than a same capacity Lexar 12x card. If you are not taking high resolution pictures all the time then this card should not be a problem.
5,This 128 MB CF card works great for me.,I too was a little scared about buying the Simpletech cf card after seeing some of the negative reviews. So far I've had the card for about 3 months and have had absolutely no problems yet. I use a Minolta camera.
1,A huge disappointment,"This was very boring. The author delivered the lectures in a dead-pan tone and often seemed to not know what he was talking about. Another reviewer mentioned that DVPress is defunct. It is, and I agree that this product should not be sold. Buy a book instead."
3,Probably Good For You,"We were expecting these to be a bit different than what we got. They are drier and not sweet. (I actually tend to like things not sweet). I am sure they are probably good for you & they are not the worst bars we have tried. I think for the cost, I wish I enjoyed them more. You get enough bars to last a long time. They'll probably expire before we use them all, though."
1,Gave A Good 50% Effort!,"Just a quick comment, to note how aggravated I am . . . I ordered the 64"" by 25' window plastic, thrilled that ANYONE makes plastic closer to our window size (about 63.5"" long) but found that the plastic enclosed was only 32"" by 25' . . . I didn't have the heart to unroll it all the way and measure. I'm incredibly annoyed, and now will be even further behind on covering our windows, which frankly upsets me more than having been cheated like this . . . ARGHHHHH!"
5,Simplicity Makes Sense,"This book lays out all the information you ever heard in self help, motivational books in one easy to read bundle! An easy to read, easy to remember content. The Author purposefully wrote it this way. Great for people who are new to entrepreneurism, mlm or direct marketing."
1,Same rah rah stuff,"I received a promotional copy in the mail, and I thank the author for that, since I didn't waste any money on it.This is a truly unoriginal book. After reading the first few pages, I could see where it was going. I scribbled a few ideas on a piece of paper and started flipping forward through the book. Sure enough, he hit every one, and not much else.This is another rehashing of every rah-rah book you've read on sales, and there are many hundreds of them. I've read several dozen of them, and they all sound the same after a while. The real problem with a book like this is that there might actually be something new in here, but I'd never want to spend the time reading to find it.Typical sections:You Gotta...visualize successYou Gotta...think like a winnerYou Gotta...sell yourselfYou Gotta...go the extra mileYou Gotta...use the power of numbersYou Gotta...do better than this to sell this book."
4,Goatskin Glove Review,"The Wells Lamont goatskin gloves I ordered were as expected....good and long. The quality is good and the price was resonable. I will purchase again, but I hope thay last a long time.Wells Lamont #1788M Medium WMNS GoatskinGloves"
4,Unconventionally Conventional,"I don't spend much time reading novels, but some time away at my parent's house lead me back to the glorious world of fiction. I almost didn't read this one because I thought, ""oh, man, I am not in the mood for a romance novel"" but this book read as a romance novel plus a lot more.I really enjoyed the author's voice as he explored and ""lived in"" the life of Jesse and Mickey. His tone was realistic - and I heard some of myself in his thoughts and phrasings. Jesse was especially multi-dimensional.Also, the exploration of family was excellent - again, especially from Jesse's perspective.It also reminded me there are many stories within our family tree that are not ""open"" that would fascinate us - and remind us of the uniqueness of these people with whom we share our blood lines.There are some of the usual ""romance-novel"" aspects of this book as well, but for the most part I found it deliciously, perfectly unconventionally conventional."
4,Great holiday read,"A cracking murder mystery: dark, clever, at times sarcastic, often surprisingly funny. Atkinson's characters are a wry, entertaining bunch. I particularly liked Gloria, the ageing wife of a millionaire builder, who is good with computers, likes kittens, and expects her slippery husband to soon be dead - ""with any luck""."
4,annoy-ing hyph-ens,i enjoyed this novel but was constantly distracted by the separation of words by hyphens. apparently the kindle formatting has a glitch with this bo-ok.
3,Boring,"The first three quarters of this book just dragged on and on. The author talked about her characters in depth where she would focus so intensely and for such a long time on a character that you forgot exactly who the other characters were when she finally switched to the next. She also discussed different incidents numerous times with a different approach which got confusing. It was interesting how she connected the characters and the last quarter of the book was pretty good which makes me believe that if she had condensed this book it might have been good,"
3,A good mystery book,"This book contains a series of very improbably events that somehow come together to make up an interesting and compelling plot.It ios the type of mystery that gets you going through it because you must find out how the story comes to an end and that is the mark of a good mystery.Enjoyed this book and would read others by the same author.J. Robert Ewbank, author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,A Rambling But Delightful Mystery,"Kate Atkinson writes as if she has attention deficit disorder. Whenever she describes something, her attention wanders off into seemingly disconnected details and odd,but pleasant, observations about her characters. This can be off-putting, but once you get the hang of how she writes, you can see that this is her way of taking a crime novel and making it a little more interesting and enjoyable. There's a mystery here -- a good one, with great characters and a compelling plot -- but you just have to wander through the maze to understand it. You'll be rewarded -- not only at the end but all along the way. Atkinson's character of Jackson Brodie is a good one. Her insights into her characters is also fascinating. All in all, another very good book by this gifted author."
5,One Really Good Read ...,"This was my first Kate Atkinson book and I'm definitely up for more. Great style. Super characterization. Intriguing plot. And it all takes place in one of my favorite locations ... Edinburgh, Scotland. Cool."
3,Lavelle #528T Fill valve,The new valve was fairly easy to install. The valve does not have the fushing power of the original valve. The original valve was faster and had a complete flush. The replacement valve has to be held down for about four seconds to get a complete flush.
5,Consumer friendly,"I actually purchased this valve a few years ago. The original valve on my Toto toilet broke spontaneously and none of my local hardware or big box stores sold a replacement. Thankfully, I found it here and was able to install it myself (by the way, the entirety of my handywoman training came from watching ""While You Were Out"") as the directions are very easy to understand. The valve is still working like a dream."
3,okay,"This is the only Enigma album I own, and from what I have heard, one is enough. They all sound pretty much alike. I like most of the songs, but then again, if you like one, you like em all. It seems like he can write 3 different songs and then just vary those 3 slightly to create an album. Whenever Cretu starts singing it gets a bit annoying. I just picture some kind of Michael Bolton looking guy with a mullet and a bad puffy shirt....real sweaty too. The best thing about this cd is the transparent booklet...much more original than the music. I'm not sure they make it that way anymore though....oh well. So , the music is pretty good, but it's very formulated, and he's certainly not the only person who can write songs like this. New age music like this is a dime a dozen."
5,Calm the Storm,"I was on my way home from the studio late one cold winter night. I shouldn't have gone out to the studio because there were reports of a snow storm, but I had beats in my head that had to get put down to disc. About twenty to 4 in the morning I stepped out of the studio and couldn't hardly see anything. I drove home super slow and had this album in. It was a crazy drive but this album was very calming and very amazing. I can't say enough good things about Michael's work. He's incredible!!"
3,"Different from their previous two albums, but good","The mix on this album is different from the previous two releases. If you, like me LOVE the earlier releases, listen to the sound clips before buying this album. I own it, and don't regret it!"
5,Enigma's Best Album,"Of all their albums, this one is their best. Their greatest hits one is extremely good, but this is their best of non-greatest hits material."
2,Not much to do with previous releases,"Maybe I expected too much for Enigma 3, but this album is definitely deceiving. The whole album hasn't the feeling of something solid, it's too ethereal, too abstract perhaps. Two or three tracks are really good (maybe ""TNT for the brain"" (very Enigma), ""The roundabout"" and ""Beyond the invisible""). I must say that I am a die-hard for Enigma, collecting everything, and this is definitely their worst album. Not saying it's bad, but doesn't peak the level of previous releases. The tracks are nice, but many of them does not say nothing. Let's see what Enigma 4 will be (PRAY for not being like Trance Atlantic Air Waves!)."
2,avoid,Dumb movie with a father character in it that is the stupidest man to ever have inhabited a film. It would have been much better if he had killed himself and saved us the time early on.
5,Out of this world,Always have loved the show. Listen to Mark when he was on Coast to Coast talking about the show. Wish I had copy of radio program with George.
5,May well be the finest book of its kind.,"I reread this bible over and over. Can't say enough good about it. Zicree's work is superb! Only have one nit to pick. His analysis of ""Five Characters In Search Of An Exit"" completely misses the mark (pun intended). Marc, read (or reread) Sartre's ""No Exit"" then reflect on the human condition in general, the categorical roles we play, etc. Then rewatch Rod's superlative treatment of all of this. I think you'll see what I mean."
3,"Definitely worth the price, middle of the road reading.","Here's a Twilight Zone story for the fans. There is a woman living in Washington State, an honest hard working lawyer. They do exist. There is another woman, living in Pennsylvania. Recently, they just bought this book, for each other, in the Twilight Zone. True story, my sister and I, without any prior knowledge, on the same day, bought this book for each other. We are not twins, but we do this sort of thing all the time. Being in your 40s is so much fun. Aside from that, this book is interesting. If the best classics are 5 stars, this is not it. But it's really worth the [...] and passes the time for the avid reader. (I paid almost the same amount for a tiny little paperback by Stephen King...)It really is more of a chronology of the episodes. At times the write drags on, but don't we all tend to ramble? I'm glad I own it, now if someone would buy me the definitive collection for I'd be most grateful."
5,Buy It You'll Be Glad,"I have had this book since it came out in 1992 and it is a great guide for all the shows. A must-have for all Twilight Zone fans. Sorry that many reviews don't like the fact that Zicree is critical of some shows but he had to be if wanted to write an honest book. Afterall, not all the shows were gems. Some were prety lame but the majority of them worked and still hold up. You can't ask for a better book detailing the shows.Hollywood Howie"
4,"Great movie, bad actress!","This movie is one of Carvey's best! He's very charming and as always funny. You can't help but start to love his charecter. It was an excelent movie, and I would give it a full 5, if it wasn't for Eddie's (Carvey) love intrest. I don't know if the charecter was played out perfectly, and it wasn't that interesting. Or the actress, Julia Campbell, didn't give it her best. She seemed very boring, and in many ways wrong for the part, and the guy. Other than that, this is an excelent film!"
1,Swann Telephoto Lense,Were stuck with something that does not work.It was new in its package but it did not perform the job it was supposed to do.This is one product I would reccomend seeing at the store before purchasing it.
3,OVER-RATED!,"This show has got WAY 2 MUCH attention, and while u can easily sit through it, it's not the kind of show that will have you hooked in the same way as NIP/TUCK or POPULAR. I definetly will not be spending my $ on this! Every episode has the same theme! All Samantha, Carrie, Charlotte + Miranda talk about is shoes (boring!), men, sex, + Samantha's out of control sex drive. U have to be dumb to buy the boxed set! The NIP/TUCK + POPULAR boxed set is worth buying though."
3,THIS IS NOT A NEW BOOK ITS AN OLD OLD,"This is an old book she passing off as newI read this book years ago!Why do author do this! Oh yea to make extra money ,offI think it terrible when they do thisthis is an old book"
1,NOT indie music,"This music would not be categorized as ""indie rock"" by most people. Indie rock generally refers to college rock or post-punk or garage rock on independent labels (think sub-pop, matador, rough trade), not this metal crap. The concept seemed cool, as most workout DVDs have very lame techno or hip hop music, but I am disappointed by the actual product. Also - the instructor looks more like a suicide girl, not an indie music fan. I'd expect someone a little more...IDK, artsy & bohemian."
2,Gloomy and slow...,"This movie (which is based on a true story) is the story of Richard Kelly a black student who must attend an all white seminary as a condition for his parole. Since the story took place in the 1960's you can understand that he caused quite a stir.I thought that this movie was very gloomy - not something I usually like in movies. I also thought that the story was kind of scattered - and I still have some questions as to what was going on. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, unless they are really interested in the civil rights movement or really hard up for a movie or something.I received this movie free to review from BookSneeze, the opinions expressed in this review are solely my own."
4,the least Among Us,.it's a good one BUT it challenges you. I think I liked it better the second time around. there is a lot to process and many characters. it is an eyeopener that just because Seminary is attached to a school's name it doesn't mean it's a solid one. Also being in a Christian environment doesn't mean that racism or for that matter sin isn't still there. Money can corrupt and hearts can be hardened to God. In an amazing set of events God reaches young Kelly and changes him from the inside out and in not so easy ways. In the end the transformation is simply amazing. Stands are made and we learn just before the credits roll what Richard Kelly does with the rest of his life!On a side note we have not yet let our children (ages 6 1/2 and under watch this movie) due to violence.
1,Written for 8th graders at best!,"How do I say this kindly? First I saw the movie and thought it fun and entertaining, but in an unbelievable, wishful sort of way. Then, while perusing Amazon.com, I came upon the novelization of ""Hackers."" Naively I came to believe that ""wow, the book sounds better than the movie!"" So many amazing reviews surprised me, and I figured four dollars, why not. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! The dialogue is poor and paltry, the descriptions are bland, and absolutely nothing is added or expanded upon from the movie. It's a cheap rendition of the movie that takes away, if anything, from a joyful romp in the make-believe. I don't know how these other reviewers can be so deluded, but I assure you that this book is a waste of time and money."
1,"Ok Musically, Crappy Lyrics","I picked up this album because I love Evanescence and it had the version of broken with Amy Lee. The band is techically solid (they can play there instruments fine), but overall it is musically fairly generic. Not bad, but not good. Lyrically, it is atrocious. Let's take this fine exampleI wanna waste her monthly bloodWanna get some on my loveHow old is this band? 13?The band is the anti-Evanescence. There is nothing that stands out and the lyrics take away from the music. I have nothing against ""crude"" lyrics as long as they mean something. Stinkfist and Prison Sex by Tool are great examples that are ruder than the lyrics of Gasoline, but that have a point.Do yourself a favor and pick up another band."
5,xcellent,another fine cd by seether.their crunchy guitar sound is so sweet and clean.reminds me of the good old days when thrash metal was king.glad to see somebody is carrying the torch for metal.way too much autotune bubble gum pop plastic music now.i will celebrate when pop music comes crashing down in flames and grunge and thrash rule again.
5,Fantastic part two,This cd with bonus DVD is fantastic. Amy Lee is so good with seether.. I just love them both. Great bounus DVD..
2,review,"I thought my daughter would love looking at this book since she loves to look at other babies; however, the photos are very muddy. I wish they were more crisp with definite black and white colors instead of lots of grey tones. Some of the captions that go along with the photos are misleading if you are teaching your baby feelings and actions, i.e ""baby bad"" is smiling so that might elude your child to think it is ok to play with flour. Not the best, but she will pick it up to look at the photos."
5,Great Book,"This book is in exellent condition.delivery was fast, and the whole deal was smooth no problems"
2,A different kind of music.,"It might be not the most knowledgeable review,but in my humble opinion,nothing equals the Enigma MCMXC aD disc.It looks to me that all other Enigma CDs (including this one),are just trying unsuccessfully to equal their first one."
4,Robust Start to Python,I'm an old school VB programmer who has decided to freshen up my CV by adding Python to my skills. This book provided me with a great kick start to the wonderful world of Python and what it brings to the dynamic scripting languages table.The book is written so that its easy enough to grasp the concepts if you're a newbie (or old dog like me) without sounding condescending.Its worth a look if you are contemplating making the leap into Python.
4,great light,great light .... but cheap plastic hooks. lucky it has a magnet to hold it on the vehicle as the hooks don't last any time at all.
2,Fun... but disappointing,"If you have the earlier games in the series, just play them. Same game, same graphics, same lag, slow loading, absurd story...BUT, it is a unique game. And while I think the designers could have given us so much more, it is fun. More worthy of the gaming dollar than another Ghost Recon or GTA clone."
1,Not impressed,This is my first time reading Stephanie Laurens and I'm not sure I'll be reading anymore. There were too many characters and storylines in this book and it made it hard to keep up. No one story was given enough time to develop and the end seemed a little rushed. This would have been better split into a separate book for each sister rather than trying to cram it all into one.
1,Not Worth Your Time,"This book was horrible. I have read others books by this author and liked them but this one is not good at all. There is no plot, no action and NO sex. Its endless after endless page of description and dialogue. The gentleman of the story keeps trying to make the woman his mistress through the whole book and then all of the sudden wants to marry her. I have read a lot of romance and have high expectations and if I could give it ZERO stars I would."
3,Nothing Spectacular,"While this book contains some witty dialogue and fun pranks. Overall, with four characters to chase around, Stephanie can hardly keep up the characterization or the plot. It does drag and you know all too well what the outcome is going to be. However, the hardest part is truly not being allowed to care a little more about the characters. It's hard to like a book more when the characters mean so little. It's a fun read with there's nothing else to read, but don't plan on it becoming a keeper for the collection."
1,Don't be deceived,Stephanie Laurens has dragged this dreadful book out of the bottom of her desk where she should have left it. This is not a recently written book but an old manuscript she had lying around. Poor writing and miserable characters doom this book.
1,XEROX 6R737 Toner/developer cartridge for xerox copiers,This ZEROX 6R737 Toner Cartridge smudges worse than the one I replaced. I purchased this cartridge 12/19/09 and just used it for the first time and it does not work. It turns well in copier as it suppose to but the output copy is too badly smudged that I can not use the copied document. I need to return this cartridge for a replacement. Please advise.
2,Waste of my time!,"This book is for people who want to train other trainers. It is NOT for people who want to work with the actual products! It seems that instead of giving helpful, instructional details on the many unique configurations possible for IIS and Proxy Server, It focuses on BASIC configurations and THEORY. If I wanted THEORY (TCPIP, The Internet, etc), I would have purchased another book for these theoretical subjects. The 'snippets' of detail and 'case studies' do nothing for me. The case studies are simple and don't touch upon any detail that is usable in the real world. Much of what is written in this book insults my intelligence. I will most likely stay away from any 24-seven books."
4,Great for blind dates!,"Ever have a horrifically ugly blind date show up? If so, the Pig Face is for you. Once you slip this regal piece of medieval armor over their ugly mug, you won't be able to see so much as a hairy mole poking out through the air vents and slits. The only thing that keeps this from being 5 stars is that the eye slits make it hard for your ugly dates to see movies."
3,"Good, but...","...not as good as the only slightly more expensive superflash, which I used to have retrofitted onto my helmet. Also, although the self-leveling function is very cool, I feel like it points 10-20 degrees more down than I would like. Because it's self-leveling, I can't correct the angle. If the self-leveling were more straight and I didn't know that the superflash was better, this would have been 5 stars. Great concept, though."
2,Was great until it needed batteries...,"I bought one for me, and one for my wife. I tried to put new duracel's in each of them, but the battery ends didn't quite make contact. I tried very hard to make it work, but it just didn't... and I don't want to buy 10 different manufacturers of batteries to see what would work. Before the battery fiasco, I wrote the below. I returned these.Easy to install, and self leveling hinge is awesome! I have a light below my seat, and use this up high on the helmet. I notice cars are giving me much more room, than when I just had the under the seat light. Can't be too safe out there!!"
4,"Planet Bike Blinky ""3H"" Helmet Mount light","I purchased this light mainly because it appeared to be easily mounted to the rear of a bike helmet. While helmet mounting was not quite as simple as I'd hoped, it does the job and will allow switching between helmets in a matter of minutes. It's also reasonably bright and allows me to easily turn it on while riding. Overall, a nice light for the money."
3,bicycle tail light,"Although this light, with its swivel mounting, seems to be intended for the helmet, I have mounted it on the rear basket of my folder bike, using plastic ties to secure it. The light is very bright, and does the job nicely. If I want a light on the helmet, a cheaper one with a simple clip takes up less space, but then I have a plastic strip on the rear of my helmet to clip it to. The Blinky's mounting is a bit cumbersome and doesn't come off."
