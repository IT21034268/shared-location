3,"Good, but far from great","Everyone praises this movie like it's one of the best movies of all time well it's not. Actually if I wasn't such a big X-Men fan in general I would of gave this movie only 2 stars. I would of really enjoyed watching more intense gripping fighting scenes. After the Matrix came out the posibilities of making a mind blowing action scene is endless. You have the most angry, destructive, comic book character (besides the Hulk) in Wolverine how could you not take advantage of that. Wolverine and Sabertooth went to wars together yet in this movie they had a sorry stupid battle. Why? Want to see a truly great comic book movie buy ""Blade"" or ""Spawn"" and wait a couple of years hopefully they would get it right with ""X-men 2"""
1,Easily the dumbest movie of 2000!,"My kids dragged me to this travesty. The funny thing is, I used to like X-Men comics when I was a kid myself and halfway expected a good yarn. And I do enjoy sci fi movies like the Matrix, Terminator, 12 Monkeys, etc. But oh, my! What a mistake going to this turkey! There is absolutely no story to this at all, the characters are ridiculous, the acting (what acting?) is preposterous. This was the closest thing to sheer torture since they dragged me to the Pokemon movie.But don't take my word for it: even my kids had to admit it was terrible."
3,TORMENTED ADOLESCENTS AS SUPERHEROES,"This is another in a series of modern superhero flicks that attempts to make itself relevant to today's social issues, but while films like the Mystery Men poke satire at being an adolescent misfit, the type that gets into comic books, and does it tongue in cheek, this film attempts to proselotyze about how hard it is to be accepted when you are gifted. The moral of the story in this film is black and white and it lacks the the insights of the Mystery Men or the character development for that matter.The scenes itegrate the special effects flawlessely and its inherent watchability as well as the looks of the charcters are its strongpoints, the flip side is that the story moves too flawlessely and the whole film feels shallow, like a thirty minute TV episode."
5,X-Men movie,I have enjoyed ALL of the X-Men movies so this one is no exception. I'd recommend them all if you can find someone willing to give them up!
3,"I Expected More from ""The X-Men""!","This movie was pretty good. I definitely have seen worse however, I expected the fight scenes to be greater than they were. I didn't really see Storm, Cyclops, or Wolverine utilized to their fullest capabilities, and certainly not like the cartoon."
3,80/20 Not sooo hot...,"This was an OK Movie. I was expecting a little better but ffrom 1-10 I'd give it a 7. Unless you're a die hard fan, it isn't a must see movie!"
5,Great High Def Movie,Looks and sounds great in high def. Great pop-corn flick and definitely worth adding to your high def movie collection.
3,An unbiased review....,"Well, what can I possibly add to the hundred of reviews of this long-awaited over-hyped cult comics adaptation? My sober and unbiased opinion, for it's the first time ever I've seen and heard the phenomenon called ""X-men"" (well, beside the toons they show on Cartoon Network).It's not what I'd call a WOW!-movie (as it always happens with movies where about half-dozen of good actors have just several lines to tell and nothing else to stand out), but far from an UGH!-movie (like much-despised 3 helpings of Batman). Good cast, plausible and persuasive intrigue, some visually splendid as well as emotionally touching scenes, minimum gore and lethal results.ALL in ALL the movie had a relaxing effect on me. The fans will buy it, the rest of you - watch it at least once. I don't doubt there will be at least 3 series upcoming, I hope they will not spoil the first impression..."
5,Fantastic,"I was unsure about this film being a sucess as the comic books had always been a sucess, and i didn'd think the film would be able to make the cross-over, but it did. X-men is full of special effects and of the wonderful characters that brought the comics alive. The fil is about Magneto who wants to convert all of the humans into mutants to stop the segregation and outing of mutants who are then referred to as freaks. The x-men have to try and stop Magneto and co from doing this as the machine that Magneto has devised for the conversion actually kills the humans. This film is worth a watch even if you are not a fan of the comic books as it has a good story line that is easy to follow, as it explains all about the x-men clan"
4,X-Cool,I thought X-men was great. I also saw X2 X-men United. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) was my favorite character. I also liked Magneto (Ian Mckellen). I hope everybody enjoys this movie. I gave this 4/5 stars.
4,Just the right touch!,"So many movies from comics drag out the story, veer into disbelief, lack storyline, storyflow, or believability, or leave so many holes and gaps in the story that you wish you'd just read the comics and shot the director and writers of the movie.Not so with X-Men! For once, just the right touch! Not overplayed, not underplayed, told us enough to make the story believable, didn't mire down in fantastical minutae, gave lots of nods to fans of the comics while making a movie that is appealing to most.I did not give it five stars due to minor problems with the score, and one mis-cast of an actor which was mildly distracting."
3,MST3K Fans Rejoice -- Rifftrax is Here!,"On the shadowy periphery of society lives a secret organization of mutants - despised, deformed and loathed, they live in fear of a nation that holds them in contempt. They are comic book fans. And one of their favorites is X-Men, which tells the tale of a secret organization headed by Professor Charles Xavier, master of the mysterious brain device known as Cerebro and ideological enemy of the metal-manipulating villain Magneto. It's all very neat-o.Featuring the extremely British performances of Patrick Stewart (Robin Hood: Men in Tights) and Sir Ian McKellan (Last Action Hero), X-Men tries its altogether best to maintain some shred of dignity even while adults with names like Cyclops and Storm leap around in spandex suits fighting other adults named Toad and Magneto. There's a lot to work with, so Mike enlisted the help of his MST3K co-star Bill Corbett for this hilarious RiffTrax!"
1,Where is Chris Claremont,I can't beleive this was at all based on the comic. Where do I even begin? This movie has taken all of the good elements out of the comic and replaced it with utter crap.As far as the casting goes Wolverine probably got the best treatment. Jean and Cyclops were also good though they did not get the screen time they deserved. Who in the world came up with Halle Berry as Storm? She can't act her way out of a paper bag. Not to mention the bad accent. If she could not keep it all the way through she should not have done it. Anna Paquin was also a horrible idea. What happened to the southern accent that Rouge was famous for?A lot of this can be blamed on the writing. Rouge has no history with Mystique and Wolverine has no history with Sabertooth. Even worse than that is the relationship with Rouge and Iceman. Iceman and Rouge were not even at the mansion at the same time. But all of these gripes aside this movie still sucked. I have to wonder if Chris Claremont had any say.
2,This Is A Dissapointment,"X-MEN is one of the worst comic book flicks I have seen yet. The effects and acting in it was good but the characters and plot is bad. The thing I didn't like about this movie is the so called ""X-MEN"" act there the first ""X-MEN"", what I mean about this is that they are missing some of the X-men, where's Gambit, Beast, etc. Gambit was the coolest but evendentally the studio or the screenwriter didn't think he was cool. The other thing they should have did to make this film better is they should have stayed true to the comic book. Long Live GAMBIT!!"
4,Fortran 90/95 Explained,"Fortran 90/95 explained by Metcalf and Reid is a reference work that covers systematically all the fundamental concepts in the Fortran 90 and 95 programming language standard. The text is concise, yet it is sprinkled with examples. I consult the book often and usually find quickly what I am looking for."
2,"Great movie, but the DVD has defects.","I recently bought the Special Edition of Happy Gilmore. Everything was going well until I came across some defects with the DVD by freezing and skipping. The worse thing of all the movie freezes on my favorite scene with Bob Barker and the special features do not work as well. So I returned the DVD and got replacement and the same thing happens. I even tried another DVD player, the same thing happens again.I never had this problem before with any of my prior DVD's so I guess I just got a bad pressing of the DVD. Hopefully it will get corrected by Universal and I ll wait for the repressing of the DVD."
4,really funny movie one of adam sandlers best,I loved this movie and the acting was solid very funny and I would totally recomend this to any Adam sandler fan.
4,Good Sandler Vehicle,"Adam Sandler is an enigma to me. I'm not sure if he's the next Jim Carrey or the next Paulie Shore. I wasn't particularly a fan of his work on ""Saturday Night Live""(actually, the only character I remember him for is the annoying Opera-man). That said I thoroughly enjoyed ""Happy Gilmore"". What's not to like about a movie that concerns itself with a failed hockey player who turns to golf to save grandma's house and save her from the retirement home and get rich and famous and the pretty girl in the process? The scenes with Sandler and Bob Barker are classic. Ben Stiller also turns up in an amusing turn as an attendant at grandma's retirement home. Not on the level of ""Caddyshack"" but not bad."
5,Adam Sandler Awesome,"If you love Adam Sandler, you will love this movie. Buy it.My son got this for Christmas and laughed and laughed!Very fast shipping!"
5,Great!,"This is an absolutely GREAT Adam Sandler film! The Special Edition gives you TONS of deleted scenes, and other cool stuff. I HIGHLY reccomend this movie to any Adam Sandler fan (though I'm sure most fans have already seen this movie millions of times). A great buy!"
5,The funniest movie I have seen in aiong time .,This was one of Adam Sandler's best movies. I loved the fight with Bob Barker.
4,Adam Sandlers best!!!,"Adam Sandler played his best role ever in this movie that you can never watch too many times. There are so many classic lines and unforgetable scenes that can crack me up even after having seen it 10 or 15 times. This movie unlike many comedies was hilarious from beginning to end, and is definitely a movie worth owning."
4,My family's favorite Adam Sandler movie!,"If you aren't one who faints at the sound of 10 million swear words (give or take a few), had a bad day and need to let off some steam, try this movie. It releases a lot of pent-up angst as you laugh along at AS's character and his *serious* anger management issues. And the scene with Bob Barker? Priceless!! Our family still talks about it years later, and since we borrowed it out and never got it back, I'm here at amazon buying it again. I don't do that with many movies. I almost decided to Netflix (rent) it, but I know we'll want to watch it whenever we want, so I'm springing for the DVD.But don't watch it with younger kids who may go around imitating AS's angry mood swings. Wait until they can watch it & understand that it is funny because we just can't do those angry public displays (but may want to, sometimes!); or watch it with your more mature family members. (My son & I waited until my husband left the house. --just kidding ;)"
4,Happy GIlmore (Widescreen Special Edition),The Happy Gilmore DVD arrived on time and in excellent condition. I would definitely do business with this seller again. I gave this a rating of 4 because I wish that there was a way to combine shipping on Amazon when buying multiple items from one seller versus paying shipping on a per item basis.
4,A very funny movie the FIRST TIME YOU WATCH IT,"Happy Gilmore used to be one of my favorite comedies. I haven't seen it in a while now but still remember everything. The plot is very simple. It's about a hockey player named Happy that decides to start playing golf and entering in tournaments to win money for his grandmother to be able to pay off her bills and keep her house. Happy can get a hole in one from really far away easier than he can make short puts.Of course, you know it's going to be funny and it is. Happy's got anger management problems and curses at the ball, fights Bob Barker, and does mmuch more outrageous stuff.Sounds funny right? It is but, after I watched this movie a lot, it got old. It's definitely worth a rent but not a buy because it gets old after a while. It's a hilarious comedy that everyone should see but doesn't probably need to own."
5,"""You're Gonna Die Clown!""","Happy Gilmore without a doubt is one of Adam Sandler's best movies. When I was in Blockbuster one night my frieend told me to rent this. I rented it thinking it would suck because of the golf. Boy was I wrong. It was so good I got online the next day and bought it.The movie is about Happy Gilmore, ""a hockey player"" that never seems to make the team and owns the record of the only guy to try to stab somebody with their skate. After his grandmother's house is going to be auctioned by the IRS, Happy must save the day. He starts playing golf and then a mab named Chubs picks him up and coaches him. Within minutes Happy is a megastar in the PGA tour.With great scenes on the golf course and off, Happy Gilmore is a film you don't want to miss. Some other good Sandler titles you may enjoy are Billy Madison and The Waterboy, but this one is even better.HAPPY VIEWING!"
1,Rubbish,"This movie has a stupid story line and even stupider jokes. I have an adjective for this movie, it rhymes with 'rap' and starts with 'C'"
3,Uneven seems like an apt word here,"Judge Daniel Kelly, DVD Verdict -- ""Sandler's manic routine is perfect for Happy Gilmore; it's nothing you haven't seen the comedian do before but here he does it stunningly well. Unfortunately, it looks pretty average on Blu-ray; it's a step-up from the DVD, but hardly a Hi-Def transfer worth getting excited about. The only bonus content is a smattering of outtakes and deleted scenes, perfectly watchable, but very pedestrian."" Full review at dvdverdict.com."
3,"Goofy, No-Brainer Fun","If you like no-brainer comedy, you'll love ""Happy Gilmore"". Adam Sandler is at his best in this wacky golf comedy about a wannabe-hockey player who discovers he has an amazing, if untraditional, talent for golf. There are some truly hilarious moments amidst the schtick; it's definitely worth renting."
3,Funny,"Happy Gilmore is a movie about a loser who makes it big when he plays golf. A game he never thought about playing before. But push come to shove he had to to get his grandmas home back. This movie is funny, but I don't think it deserve more then 3 stars."
3,C,"This movie is funny. But you have to be aware it has its stupid not so funny moments too. It is great for the younger audiences as well as the kid that lives within everyone but it is not really a movie you need to actually purchase since they show it on television occasionally BUT once again, this is not for everyone. It is goof ball 90's Adam Sandler. One of his best early films considering the acting/behavior in Billy Madison. It is youth appropriate even with adult undertones."
5,awesome and inspiring,Incredible story of determination and courage with a Huge dose of LOVE. A woman so ahead of her time she did more and that was before women were allowed to vote in 1920.
5,MEDITATIVE ~ AWESOME ~ PERFECTION,"EXCELLENCE! I was, and still continue to be, stunned at the excellence of this recording, irregardless of times played. I should have known that the name Smithsonian on it guaranteed quality plus.Be prepared to be awestruck and silenced by the very first recording - ""There Is a Balm in Gilead"". If one is not transported to a time and place that knows true healing - then one is not keenly aware of the very breath they draw.This whole CD presents Deep Waters - - especially, ""Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child.""Give yourself quiet time for THIS rare rendition. No telephones or books - just - listen, truly listen!I look forward to adding to this ""Library of Life"" by getting three more in this Series."
3,"More of a ""Young Adult"" Book","I enjoyed reading about Defiance, Ohio in the fifties because I lived in another town in Ohio in the time, and its reproduction of the mood and mores of the time and place are well done.However, the book has a cheeriness to it that feels somewhat forced. Here is a family with 10 kids, the father is an alcoholic, the family is always living on the edge, and the mother is forced to get by writing jingles for contests. It's quite possible to imagine that life with this group was a mixture of good and bad, and that it wasn't all awful. But, its hard to imagine that it was just so relentlessly great.This book has the feel of a children's book. It's a good ""young adult"" level title, but as an adult I felt that it was just a little too cute."
3,small prize,"A good true story, but not as interesting as I had hoped. I think I'll see how the movie compares."
3,Great story - mediocre writing,"This is a wonderful story about an extraordinary lady and her ""way with words."" The real Evelyn Ryan comes to life in this book. Here was an inspirational lady who refused to let the bumps in life get in her way.My complaint is not with the portrayals of Evelyn or her family. My complaint is with the way the story is organized. The chronology of the story is confusing, especially in the first half, and there is some redundancy.People who tend to feel sorry for themselves should read this book. Evelyn's life was not easy but she kept her dignity, humor and faith in herself and her talent. I wish I had met her."
5,A 50's era women proves her mettle!,"As a woman born in the 50's and raised in the 60's, I could relate very strongly to this book. I can only imagine how difficult it must have been for this woman to try and raise her family while meeting the expectations of her husband, her church and the rest of society, while making a home and raising her family. I have nothing but admiration for the way she found a special niche for her talent for writing jingles and milked it to the fullest while struggling to raise ten children in difficult circumstances. This is a book that is inspiring because it is true, proving once again that truth can often be stranger than fiction - and more awesome."
2,much ado about nothing.,"This is an insipid little book about a cute little story. Terry Ryan has stretched what would have been an excellent essay into 350 pages of highly skippable prose. Let see, a drunk husband, lotsa kids and a tight budget. hmmm nothing new so far. Evelyn Ryan like most women in her peer group entered contests for fun and profit.If you want to read a memoir about tough times, large families and going through life with dignity I recommend James McBride's 'The Color of Water: A Black Man's tribute to his white mother'. The jewish-born widow of a black minister in that book raised 12 children and taught them how to take pain and suffering with dignity."
2,Doesn't work as designed,"I remember having this type of dish for my daughter, so we purchased this to use for our grandson. The idea is just wonderful, but this did not stick on any surface we tried to use. It slid easily over his high chair tray too. It works well as a regular feeding dish or storage in the refrigerator, but not for a curious toddler who wants to pick it up and play with it."
3,not the greatest,"I was excited to get a bowl for my son that would stay put on his high chair tray, however it doesn't. It is a nice bowl, but for the most part it is just a bowl, the suction doesn't work very well. I understand it not working on the high chair tray, but it doesn't even stay put very well on the couter top. Cut ebowl, love that is had a lid, but suction cup feature doesn't work!"
2,did not work,"i love the idea for this product, since i have a 1 year old who loves to throw her plate. the suction cup on this, however, did not work :( also, the separation between the two parts of the tray is very shallow, so my hope to be able to pack meals to go is not going to work (one good shake, and the two sides will be completely mixed with each other). too bad!"
2,Suction ring not good,Suction ring on the base is not good and our 15 mo old is able to pick and throw the bowl.
4,New to Kay Hooper,"First book I've read by this author. Enjoyed the book and story line. Also read the sequel, but didn't care for it as much as this book. Will diffinetly read more Kay Hooper books."
5,A redo but well done,"I actually read this story or what is basically this story when it was first published by the author as a series of 4 Loveswept paperbacks. In those it was better fleshed out with a little more depth for the other characters.That said, I chose to read the newer version to see how much Ms. Hooper had changed or redone. While some of it lacks the depth of the original novels, I still found this book interesting. Readers who hadn't read the Loveswept versions should still be able to follow the story as it goes along and the characters are quite enjoyable, especially Quinn."
2,"A couple of startling scenes. The special effects look obviously fake in many scenes,","It has a couple of startling scenes. In many scenes, the special effects look obviously fake. For example, the scenes when people were dragged to hell. It looks like a drawing.This movie is worth renting for curiosity but not worth buying."
1,Sam Raimi Failed,This movie was horrible and this is coming from someone who didnt expect much coming in the only remotely entertaining scene was the fight scene other than that a boring drab pg-13 horrible excuse for a horror movie the ending was very easy to figure out and the script itself didnt seem to have much thought put into at all Sam Raimi's involvement in this film must have been purely for advertisement purposes because a man of his talent couldn't have been involved in this trainwreck don't waste your time
1,More like 0 stars.....,"My husband and I both love Horror flicks. We've seen everything from the obscure (Freaks & The Audition) to the tried and true (Halloween, Black Christmas, etc) to a good gore fest (The Evil Dead, Hostel and most of the Saw movies). I could go on and on but alas I'm just here to talk about DMTH. About thirty minutes into the movie we realized that it was going to be bad. Really bad. It had alot of potential. Girl gets cursed by a Gypsy and now is tormented by a demon for three days until it will finally drag her into hell. However, I'm not sure where Raimi was trying to go. Comedy with gore perhaps? Maybe he should watch ""Shaun of the Dead"" so he knows how it's done. Look, I love gore when it meshes with the story but this was ridiculous. I felt like I was watching a movie made by a teenager. Wait, a teenager could have done alot better. And to top it off the acting was mediocre. Not a movie I would recommend if you want a good, scary, gory movie. Try ""The Decent"" instead."
4,Typical Raimi Style,"This is a fun movie to watch around Halloween time, it's not really very scary... it's kind of humorous like Evil Dead etc. The main trouble I had with this Blu-ray version was the fact that it came with a digital download disc that was only compatible with older Power PC Macs etc, so the code was not valid any longer. BUT, since it was so cheap I guess I won't return the thing."
4,weird movie,"it wasnt as what i quite expected.. i thought this movie would be better from all the reviews.... this movie is cool, but suprisingly not as cool and what i expected to awesome...defintely a 4 out of 5 stars :)"
2,Lame,"I bought this for my girlfriend. It was cheap so I figured I'd go ahead and throw it in my cart since she had it on her wishlist. A good excuse to cuddle up on the bed under the covers. The beginning of the movie was awesome. Scary. Really good. It had a great story, and the old gypsy lady was very well done. I was glued to the TV. But I must say, as the movie went on, it got worse. About half way, it took a turn for the worse and started a downward spiral. It started to get ridiculously stupid. By the end of the movie, I had lost all interest. I found myself getting up, wandering around, getting sodas and talking, mostly about how stupid the movie had gotten. It was really bad. Great beginning, not so great middle, and a crappy stupid ending. It was almost as if the original directors, producers and writers just got up and went on strike, leaving amateurs to just throw something together to get the movie finished. Thumbs down."
3,Classic Sam Raimi,"If you enjoyed movies like, Sam Raimi's, classic Evil Dead, this movie could be right up your alley. Over the top horror film. I find myself laughing loudly at some of the scene's, but my daughter finds them horrifying."
5,Genius Horror at its best,Sam Raimi is back doing what he knows best...HORROR. The music and pacing of this movie will have you jumping out of your shorts. The story and characters are well developed and the ending is just pure Sam Raimi. The only thing missing is Bruce Campbell!!!!!
3,not what I expected,"I've heard so much good stuff about this movie and how scary it was . it would've been a great movie if it was filmed back in the early 80's . It is not that scary of a movie and I found myself making fun of it more than anything . there was so many stupid things that went on it this movie that it was unreal like the talking goat . If you wanna watch a good cheesy movie with a lot of gross things then you may like this movie . it's one that you can sit down to with a couple of your buddys and crack jokes through the whole movie and when I say gross I'm not talking about blood and guts , I'm talking nasty as in watching an old woman loose her teeth and gum'n someones chin . I gave this 3 stars because it was worse then what I was expecting however it was a movie kind of like the evil dead movies which I loved."
4,And the Lamia will come to get u!!...A Drag Me Review.,"72 hours to get off my back the sickest funnyest goat demon alike a person has ever to endured?, a really creepy prosthetic face coming off parts of an old (reaaaally senil) gipsy woman, and an amazing ability to mix the most incredible SFX and spiderman`s alike graphics...added to all and it is an amazing horror-comedy movie. It is true, u will jump off the seat twice or maybe more, but I garantee u will also laugh as loud as the very goat demon appears further in the movie...If u want to spent that kind of moment, jump and laugh, u most definitly watch this SamR`s masterpiece. Enjoy it in company...ou and almost forgot, never loose any buttons from ur clothes."
2,What the hell.....,"I had high hopes for this movie from the very start. The retro shot back to 1968 to start the mood and the ""myth"" that surrounds the entire story (which has real potential if it wasn't so poorly acted). The acting is the major problem with this movie. I will admit, the ending was no shocker. I loved Justin Long in JEEPER'S CREEPERS, but in this he was as weak as he could be...nothing. The real problem lies with the lead...Alison Lohman, she is dreadful. You have absolutely no connection with her character. She is just going through the motions. No development, no empathy, no sympathy, no hatred, no nothing. She is one-dimensional and that is the real disaster of this movie. As I stated, I felt the story line had potential, with perhaps a bit more polishing of the script, but definitely with another lead actress in the role."
1,Beware !,"This review is short and not sweet,,**Spoiler** The lead character is a loser.She kills her kitten ...to appease a demonic spirit that later spits the kittens corpse out at her feet and laughs at her stupidity...I wanted her to die and thought this movie was perhaps an attempt to anger me personally..and although i knew this was not the case i was glad when the movie was over.. Instead of buying this movie buy Evil Dead ."
1,Pretty Bad,It started off fun and scary and then got worse. When the goat started talking I was like really?? OK I hate this movie.
3,It was ok.,"I was happy that Sam got back to horror and you could see it in the movie. As others have suggested, the main character was more of a victim here rather then the Gypsy lady. She seemed just down right evil. I mean seriously, she was given several chances to right her problem and she didnt. What, when she was given yet another chance and failed to fix the problem she wanted another bit of help? The ending was predictible and I was saddened by that. It is a good movie to rent, buying is another story.On to the DVD- Now that was a disappointment. Special features were lacking greatly. Come on now. One thing I noticed about the movie was it had a lot of Raimi's in it which is always good. Still just a 3 out of 5 though."
4,New Life in a sea of crappy horror releases.,"I was really surprised by this movie. Being that I'm a big fan of the Horror genre, this caught my attention. Without giving spoilers, I just have to say it is great, from the mood to the scary parts that make you jump, to the funny parts. DMH is very entertaining and if you are a fan of the Horror genre, I recommend it big time. These days it's hard to come across a real good horror movie, you have to be selective. I bought my copy for $4 at my neighborhood Box Office Video, but I would have paid more for it if I had to. You should pick up a used copy for $1 off of Amazon."
1,As Expected - Very Bad,"This movie is too long for a simple story plot about two rival triad groups trying to take revenage of each other. Basically, each move and each plot is so predictable and too much fighting action that was not even needed for the scene.Also the part about HK prison, it is not even anything close to the HK prison condition. The movie is giving people wrong impression that HK prison condition is so brutal and inhuman, esp, the part when Jet was hung by his leg and the prison guards were to hit him to punish him for fighting with the guards. The prison environment in this film would give viewers misconception that HK prison is dirty, not hygenic, or crowded. But, these are not true at all.All in all, this is one of the worst on DVD i have seen so far, and not really recommend you to watch at all."
2,a very bore moive,"a typical hollywood stuff, a lot of action and violence and considers the viewers as fools."
3,A good entry for Li...,"Jet Li's film ""Romeo Must Die"" is not a translation of ""Romeo and Juliet,"" it just mirrors the story a little. That's fine with me, as long as I get my fight scenes. There are tons of fight scenes in this movie and therefore, reasons to be pleased. My big complaint, though, is that not for one minute do we doubt that Li can't handle the black gangsta bad guys in this movie. They're too easy to beat up and provide no challenge for him. But his chemistry with Aaliyah works well as she was a good actress and had a nice screen presence. Li's acting isn't that good, but what do you expect? Oscar-winning performances? The guy whispers half his lines, for crying out loud! Overall, ""Romeo Must Die"" is a treat for the martial-arts fan in all of us."
1,"Romeo must... i repeat, must... die","I have never really been a Jet Li fan. I think he's to one dimensional and he's always the though guy. Not only that, he uses wires in virtually all of his action sequences. When I started to watch this film, i was going to watching it as if i've never seen a Jet Li film before. But my opinion eneded up the same. It was a bad movie, with bad acting and average action sequences. It was just a macho movie, with no point. If you want a martial arts film with all the stunts done without wires and where it's fun and exciting, get a Jackie Chan flick (although his recent couple of films have had obvious wire stunts in them, he is 50 yoou know). Jackie Chan is the best action star there is, was, and ever will be. If you want quality, get Jackie Chan. Garbage, get Jet Li."
3,it has been 4 years since my angle left earth,"this was a good movie with aaliyah showing her beauty of her movie and into da big screen she did a good job in this film she Delroy Lindo, DMX,and Isaiah Washington all were great in their acting roles Jet Li brought da action while anthony hamilton brought da comedy this movie when reminds me of da time when i was beginning 2 notice aaliyah mult talents on and off da screen n 2 her music she was that special somebody i was hoping 2 b with i really wish she could have stay longer than she did she was only 22 years old when she die she was extremely near her peak because each video that she produce was at or near #1 and her films even though she made 2 was very watchable"
3,"Well, maybe next time","Jet Li is a prolific Martial Artist. However, I don't see him teaching English in an American university. Likewise, American director don't need to make eastern style Martial Arts films. It's just not what we do well here. It's a decent script, good action, bad wire work on some of the stunts. They tried to go over the top with the action and effects. Typical Hollywood. Hong Kong stars don't need that kind of excess, they have talent."
2,romeo must die,i remeber when this come in the 9th grade i got change to see jet li for the frist time and Isaiah washington i already know aaliyah i grew to heri saw her talk about this movie on rosie show i herad from my friends in school while i was in class one day nobody talk about much aaliyah was here . aaliyah did ok the movie was fake i seen his HK MOVIES HE did butt kicking than the soundtarck is better aaliyah did well on try again. buy ounce time in china or fist of lenged jet li best.
2,"BAD PLOT, MEDIOCRE MOVIE","A JAILED CHINESE COP [JET LI] ESCAPES FROM PRISON TO COME TO OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA TO SEEK HIS BROTHER'S KILLER. NOT LONG AFTER HE GETS THERE, HE FALLS IN LOVE WITH A BEAUTIFUL GIRL [PLAYED BY THE LATE AALIYAH] WHOSE FATHER [DELROY LINDO] HAPPENS TO BE THE LEADER OF A RIVAL SYNDICATE. HAS SOME GOOD MARTIAL ARTS SCENES, BUT OTHER THAN THAT, A MEDIOCRE MOVIE WITH A BAD PLOT. AS I'VE SAID MANY TIMES BEFORE, I'M NOT REALLY A FAN OF JET LI, AND THE ONLY REASON I EVEN TAKE A LOOK AT HIS FILMS IS BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO LOVE MARTIAL ARTS MOVIES. IF YOU DO LIKE JET LI, I ADVISE YOU TO SKIP THIS MOVIE AND SEE THE FIST OF LEGEND, WHICH IS HIS BEST MOVIE."
1,They faked it.,"I like Jet Li but this movie is so faked it was impossible to get into the story. We are suppose to beleive this is the Bay Area of California but we see the Vancouver B.C.'s skyline,and locations and mountains, scene after scene, only the license plates and flags have been changed to protect the innocent. I just could not take any of it seriously. Lets have more truth in location. Pleeeease!"
1,Romeo should have died.,"Romeo Must Die is terrible for several reasons. First of all, it features a story that's absolutely stupid and boring, and the filmmakers actually try to make it a lot more complex than it actually is. The fight scenes lack excitement, and the wirework doesn't help, either. Then there's the so-called romance, which probably should have been excised completely because no heat is generated between Jet Li and Aaliyah."
4,Quick shipping,"I received the DVD withing a week of ordering. My only ""compliant"" is that there there was an old sticker on the case that was slightly difficult to remove but it was really no big deal."
4,action packed movie(dhishum dhishum type),"The movie is good but it is almost the replica of the ""MATRIX"". But still a must watch movie."
2,Typical,"Romeo Must Die was a let down. While entertaining to a degree, the movie suffered from the typical ridiculous plot (most of which had nothing to do with 'Romeo & Juliet'). Like most Hong Kong movies, the fights had alot of wires stunts. But with all the hype and money put into this movie, I was expecting better quality, not bad acting from Aaliyah, over the top computer graphic fight scenes and a terrible ghetto rap soundtrack. Skip this one."
5,I think this is one of his best movies,"His character has a little mystery to him. A little nice, a little dangerous, and the romance part works even without any sex scenes."
4,Good movie for Jet Li and/or chopsake fans,"Nothing spectacular to add, just that the movie is fun to watch... especially Jet Li's fight scenes. Also a tribute to Aaliya - she showed promise. Plot was pretty tried and true - acting average to good. Fight scenes, not overly realistic but lots of fun!If you missed out on this movie somehow... I recommend!All the best,Jay"
4,"This is for Tiger (OS X 10.4 and later), NOT PANTHER",The fact the gentlemen above didn't realize this is shocking as the overview makes it clear.
3,The House of Whispering Pines,"When I saw the title, I immediately thought this book was going to be similar to other books I've read by Phyllis Whitney and Victoria Holt but I was so disappointed. I found the book very boring and at times I found myself reading pages and afterwards wondering what I had just read. It was a very difficult book to read and follow, not entertaining at all."
4,"kind of slow at first, but very suspenseful, and I enjoyed it very much","Kind of slow at first, but very suspenseful, and I enjoyed it very much. It kept my interest all the way through the book."
4,Satisfied,"I ordered this product mostly because the price was a shocking $0.01. I thought it was a mistake, but bought it anyway. The adapter arrived within a few days and worked perfectly. I'm quite pleased."
1,Don't Bother,I bought this to plug my sirius reciever in to a plug in my home. It doesnt work for that or my cell phone. It is junk
2,"Not enough power, or?","Purchased the power supply to be able to use my GPS in the house. Either it is a defect or doesn't have enough power. Will check further when our four feet of snow goes away and I can get out. Sorry, it may be usable for lighter items. Don't know what will draw less current."
1,adapter,item did not work on any plug i tried it with. and since it only cost 50 cents i'm not going to go through the trouble of trying to send it back.
3,ac/dc converter,Bought this converter to power up a 12vdc air compressor.Unfortunately it does not have sufficient current (need 1 amp it only puts out about half of that).I should have looked at the specs closer.
1,Negative,"I ordered this product on June 29th, 2010 and till date I haven't received my shipment.Since i have not received the product, i can't rate this product.Next time i have to think twice before buying any product from amazon."
4,12V appliance power compatibility,I have found the product useful but nust use a rubberband to hold my appliance inside the receptacle so it will not pop out. Verify your 12V appliance will fit inside the receptacle before purchase.
1,Junk-don't buy!,I Bought this along with a RAD Tire Inflator. It was even recommended by Amazon. The inflator was rated at 13.5 Volts. The SEM adapter was rated at 13.5 volts. No go. You get what you pay for.
1,I dont like it,I am a good customer of Amazon and got this AC/DC Adapter but I think it didnt give the 12V output well and didnt work with my Portable DVD player. I wish I get the better one.
1,CRAP! - Don't buy it...,"... and especially if you are buying this in combination with the 12 VOLT ELECTRIC AIR PUMP w/GAUGE for Tires Bikes Cars Air Matresses by RAD Cycle Products. I don't know why these are being offered as a group - they do not work together. The DC converters do not offer nearly enough amperage for the pump. They MAY work for your phone charger (if by chance you've lost the USB charger(even in that case, it might be easier to just buy a new one vice sing this POS)). I would give it no (0) stars if I could."
3,Good But dont experiment,"Bought this about 2 weeks back. Worked fine when connected to a car charger powered FM transmitter which I connected to my Sansa MP3 player. However my curiosity got the worst of me. I decided to try it out by connecting the FM transmitter to my DELL Laptop while it was being powered by this Adapter. Guess what. I ended up burning a 1 ohm resistor and 2 1N4007 rectifiers on the charger's circuit board. Tried replacing the parts but couldn't get this thing to work again. So I just decided to purchase a new one since it was not costly. Anyway a satisfactory deal, I must say."
1,garbage,"Arrived dead in the water. Not worth returning. Once again, you get what you pay for. Happens with a lot of junk from China."
5,By the Fireplace with Mr. Lunsford,"This is a pleasant and intimate little collection of old time music. The feel of it is that I've pulled up a rocking chair and it's just Mr. Lunsford and me by the big fireplace pictured on the cover. It includes such Lunsford classics as ""Old Mountain Dew,"" which he wrote, and ""A Mole in the Ground."" It also includes such little gems as the fiddle tune ""Ten Steps,"" which would have been lost forever had Lunsford not learned and recorded it. The booklet accompanying the CD is very informative on Lunsford's life and work, and provides background for each cut. Lunsford also has comments on some of the pieces before or after playing them, and the final cut is his own autobiographical sketch. I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in folk/roots/old-time music and the Appalachian culture."
1,I gainned weight!!,"When I first heard about this book I was excited and happy to have perhaps found a solution to my problem.The book would have been a lot more believable without all the evolution garbage. If we were created instead of evolving most of the author's theories wouldn't work and they don't. I eagerly read the book, ignoring my gut feelings and disappointment in his evolution theories, and put it into practice for 6 weeks. I ate only when I was truly hungry and stopped as soon as I was full. I also exercised as hard as I could for six weeks. After 6 weeks I discovered I gained 4 pounds! I then cut back on my exercise to 4 days a weeks, cut back on fat grams to 20 percent of total and have now been slowly and happily losing a pound and a half a week. Diet alone and exercise alone do not work. It takes both. Save your money, this books advise we all already know."
5,Where To Begin....,"Enthralling and captivating, you wont be able to put this book down. Unlike the Mr. Pikes other adult books, Sati takes on an entirely new perspective...one dealing with hope, love, life and happiness. Even if you don't believe in God or any other religion for that matter...this book is for you, for Sati will teach anyone who reads this book the true reason for living...Sati is remarkable and I can't agree more with Michael in saying that even if Sati isn't God...she is definatly what God should be like. And I for one, never really believed in a God or spiritual sorce until I read this book.I couldn't put this book down..but if you are unlike me and don't find this book exciting, you might want to have a bit of patients. But I would recommend it for anyone 13 years or older..boy or girl.'You won't be the same once you meet her'*Teanna* 14 year old reader"
4,A book that was good enough,"This book was good enough to grab my attention, especially because there weren't choices at every page, like some books which I don't like. This book was also exciting enough so that I was tempted to read on and on. I am also liking the fact that there is a VHS tape, and I can't wait to get that!So if you're looking for a good Choose Your Own Adventure story, you've come to the right one."
2,I've had better!!,"I bought this cd because there were a few songs on there that i liked. However, while it is ok, I do not find this arrangement of Christmas songs the best. I have much better. Even the songs that initially drew me to this cd weren't as good as i thought."
4,Never quite what you expected,"Pratchett's Discworld continues in fine style. It combines his signature combination of incredible characters, groanable puns, wild adventure and maybe, just maybe a little serious reflection. I'm not sure that Pratchett would admit to that last, though.And no, no one is quite what you expected. There's the king, elevated from his former role as jester (or was he?). The queen is shy, uncertain, and naive (or is she?). The witches' contest of power ends when one looks away (or does it?). The elves are wondrous and glamorous - or are they?The serious side flirts with the many-worlds ideas from physics, serious science sure to warm the soul of any comedic writer. It also raises some symbols of a long-gone warrior queen, and leaves with some pointed observations on symbols being what you let them. Mostly, though, it's just more of Pratchett's laugh-out-loud history of a world that's even more ridiculous than our own - or is it?//wiredweird"
4,Pratchett's getting darker--and better,"Few authors have offered quite as much as Pratchett--he takes on complex concepts, wraps them up in humour, and delivers them via characters like Granny Weatherwax. (And Nanny Ogg--the Hedgehog's Song is one of those underrated literary classics of all time.) Wonderful meeting them again in Lords and Ladies--do yourself a favour, pick this one up even though it's considerably darker, and angrier, than Pratchett's usual stuff. I read Lords and Ladies around the same time I browsed through a short story by David Brin. Brin's story speculated, like Pratchett, that fairies were actually nasty, inhuman creatures--pushing the thesis to its logical conclusion, he postulated that fairies were actually the original aliens. Brin's almost certainly the more rigorous thinker; but Pratchett has a helluva lot more fun."
1,"Don't waste your $$$$, item is no good",This flashlight will break in a matter of seconds if dropped. Poorly built at best. Get a regular type flashlight any brand will be better.
1,One-Sided,"Hmmmm, let's think about this for a moment. If George Gilder's thesis, that ""most welfare programs only serve to keep the poor in poverty as victims of welfare dependency,"" is correct, then why aren't American corporations wallowing in poverty? Major business corporations receive literally billions in subsidies from American taxpayers; i.e., corporate welfare, yet they only get wealthier. If Gilder's thesis is correct, ""dependent"" companies that live off government contracts and subsidies should be filling for bankruptcy at this very moment. They aren't of course, and the reason is because they are wallowing in corporate welfare subsidies that keep their inefficient businesses afloat.George Gilder claims to be in favor of supply side, ""trickle down"" economics, but in truth that's a misnomer. What he really argues for is ""trickle up"" economics; that is, take money from the poor and give it to the rich.Take my word for it, this is a bad book with a flawed thesis."
2,Really wanted it to work,I will have to add this deodorant to my long list of 'non-working natural deodorant'. I have to reapply it several times along the day and still does nothing for me. Still looking for a natural solution...
2,If you like to reaply multiple times/day this is for you,"This deodorant doesn't do much for me. I have to reapply it 4 times during the day if I want it to even barely work. When will someone make a deodorant without harsh chemicals that actually works?!I'm bummed, it was really expensive, and I really wanted it to work, but it just doesn't."
1,Unhappy,"Bought the 2way breeder, and put our 2 week old fry in it only to have them swim thru the slots in it and get ate."
1,Dexter Cap isn't even worth the low price.,I don't recommend this hat unless it's for your kids. Even with the adjustable strap it's way too small for large head size.
3,"A simple, easy read","Like the others in this series, this is a simple, easy read - and very entertaining. Not the most complex book - big on plot with Superman (actually detective Owen McKenna) and Mighty Mouse (actually Wonder Dog Spot)combatting evil and making the world a safer place for you and I.I've purchased all the books in this series because they are fun, a little bit over the top but they do hold your interest."
4,Entertaining and topical,"This is the first Todd Borg book I've read, but I'll be ordering more. A well written, entertaining and very topical mystery, the protagonist is likeable and the story hangs together well. I live in the Tahoe area and it was interesting to read about places I know.A couple of notes - salmon is spelled with a lower case 's'; the past tense of 'pet' is 'petted'; never, ever, use 'off of'. It should be just 'off'. I know - picky, picky, picky!"
4,whimsically good...,"I first heard the song ""My fear keeps god a-hiding"" back in May 2005. I was blown away by the beauty of it. I recently came across this CD and gave it a listen. It's a great CD and highly recommended.Why this duo aren't more popular(?), I'll never know."
4,My review of Malthus,"The descriptions of overpopulation in this book are great. Malthus has excellent suggestions for solving problems like these. He also talks about climate control, poverty, and famine because of overpopulation. I believe that Malthus is an extraordinary philosopher. I suggest this book for anyone interested in worldly affairs that could be problems in the future."
5,Asterix and the mansions of the Gods.,"When I first read the book I thought it was all abpout the roman gods but then I found out what it was about, it was an exiting and comical book and I look foward to readindg more."
4,Excellent service,"I got this as a Christmas present for a sister-in-law who is developmentally delayed and enjoys watching reruns on TV (before the days of home video and now DVD) - I received this in a very timely manner, and she was very excited to receive it, and has told me that she thoroughly enjoyed watching it (and my sister and her husband verify!)."
3,Wrong sided,"Item appears to be right or left handed but there is no indication of this. The loops were fine, but the large center piece was backwards on both of the sword frogs I ordered. If they are meant to be right or left handed they need to be labeled and sold as such.Otherwise product was fine and held the rapier sword well."
4,Highly recommended,"I haven't finished this yet, but, so far, it is excellent and I highly recommend it. Very well-written, entertaining, and thought-provoking.Looking forward to more books (fiction and non-) by this author"
1,Self indulgent gossipy trash.,"I'd dream of a better book if I was Daphne. Its incredible what sells for literature these days. This book is the equivalent of trashy TV-Talkshows but with an overabundance of fancy words. Don't waste your money. Buy it on the street for .25 cents, then maybe you'll get your money's worth. Useless and not even entertaining. You would get more mental stimulation counting your socks on a friday night than reading this book. Daphne, get a new therapist, and write something everyone would enjoy not just your friends."
5,Nice CD,"For those who are fans of Palomo, you will enjoy this CD if you purchase it. It's worth buying. I would say all the songs are good. Of course, there's some that will stand out. The songs I liked most were ""Yo te Propongo"" and ""Miedo""."
4,Still a good typewriter,"This is almost exactly the same typewriter that we needed to replace after 12+ years. It is heavy duty with all the features needed a decade ago. We are still very happy with the features of this model. This is for use in an university administrative office that is about 20 years behind the times and still uses 5-page, NCR forms that must be typed! Only a few forms are now availble to us online so this typewriter will need to last us awhile..."
3,"Very nice, but very expensive","The rose flower water was very good, however it was very expensive. I have found good rose flower water (and orange flower water) at Middle Eastern stores (including Azar's online) for less than half the price."
5,Earth Science Shampoo,"I really like this shampoo, it leaves my hair soft and I'm glad it is fragrance free. I will definitely buy it again."
4,"good product, annoyed with supplier.","Great product, just don't recommend you order it from this supplier. If you are allergic to perfume, this is a reliable choice. But, the supplier didn't send the correct quantity (bottle sizes turned out to be MUCH smaller than advertised.KInd of a gyp.)"
2,not as advertised,"The product it's self is fine, but what you get is 12oz bottles in clear not green bottles (new packaging I guess), and not the 17oz advertised."
5,straight from the source - invaluable,This cd is an invaluable resource for those interested in the rhythm and song traditions of cuban santeria. A collection of field recordings documenting cojuntos in matanzas and havana. This cd is raw but authentic.
2,"Disappointing for an ""Idiots"" book","""Idiots Spanish"" is disappointing on the scale of ""Idiots"" books. I've purchased and read several of their series for research at work and all have proven very helpful, but this one falls short of being fun, interactive, or relevant information. The teaching methodology used in this book is useless. It's more of a reference-type book than a book you could use to learn the language.My recommendation: skip this ""Idiots"" book and go with a combination of Pimsleur's Spanish tapes/cds to learn the spoken and ""Practical Spanish Grammar"" to learn the written.Buenas suerte!"
1,rubber smell,This is so strange and a first experience of this type. I ordered 2 of these and both emit a horrible burnt smell. I washed and line dried and the smell is still there. I have washed many many times now and still the smell persists and is no weaker. It is so strong that my clothes absorb it. I have never used the dryer for them and I wash in cold water. I guess I will have to throw them away.
5,my favorite cherry adair book!,"i love cherry adair and this is my favorite of all of her books (of which she has many)! she writes books with men who are dominate but are not afraid to be loving. sexy, hot and exciting!"
1,Not a very good book...,"I purchased this book based on the high ratings here, but was very disappointed. The writing was stilted and the characterizations were shallow. Many pivotal actions taken by the characters seem to occur for no reason other than the writer needing them to happen in order to advance the plot. I don't know much about this author, but I'm guessing that she's inexperienced. Maybe when she gets a few more books under her belt she'll be worth reading. Until then, I'll stick to Nora Roberts, Linda Howard, Sandra Brown, Iris Johansen, etc."
3,3.5 stars actually,"Marnie Wright just wants to decide what's best for her for a change. She doesn't really need her overprotective domineering father or her 4 overprotective domineering brothers to decide for her and she really doesn't need this -- sexy silent mountain man, Jake Dolan of the delectable mouth and gorgeous legs to distract her from making her own decisions. Circumstances put Marnie & Jake in close quarters while being pursued by guys who'd like to see Jake dead. Danger and biology are all these two need to keep their senses on high alert.While I liked both leads and loved the dog, I wanted a little more than this insular tome provided. The set piece used for the climax was really well done and wrapped things nicely. This was completely by the numbers but an enjoyable read nonetheless. I'm quite interested in T-FLAC but this seemed to be a very low-key entry to what I presume is a high-adrenaline series."
3,Don't mix and match sets,"I bought the car set with two extra figures to go with the Polly Pocket doll house set, because the doll house set only had one figure included. Only trouble is the car set figures are about half the size of the figure in the doll house. Hard to explain to my grand daughter. Best explanation was that the car set was little people from the circus. Kinda disapointing !!!"
2,|GALLAGHER IS BETTER,Jeff HEaley tries to sound as blues / rock genius and he is really a rare gifted guitar player and singer. But the tunes in this selection makes no justice at all at his talents. The result sounds more like a minor-league version of Irish master Rory Gallagher.
4,"Finally, 3 hours of record time","I've always appreciated Maxell's quality, and now I finally have the ability to record 3 hours (9 in extended mode) at a time!..."
1,"Maxell 9 hour, but only for a while",This product has come unwound inside of 2 different VCR's. I'm on my 4th attempt to find one that is not defective or lasts at least more than 3 months
1,awful,"This was so badly written. The plotting is miserable and idiotic. The heroine is ridiculous. The hero (a Duke no less) is pathetic. i can't believe this is the author's fifth book. She still hasn't learned how to show not tell her story. The characters are poorly developed. There is no plot, only inane scenarios popping up left and right with no sense. It's like the author strung together romance-book-required phrases and subplots. She even threw in a paranormal bit with one of the sisters and a hidden passageway behind a bookcase for no reason. so ridiculous. into the dustbin. I can't believe HarperCollins published this completely pathetically written book. I can't believe i wasted my time reading it."
3,good,"Okay, it's not as good as the first two to me. Even though I don't have to have action in a movie to enjoy it, I was hoping for a little bit cause I love Tenchi battles. But there is none, battle-wise at least. The story is good and if you take it by itself and don't compare it to the rest of Tenchi (any of it), it's actually very good. I do hope that AIC and Pioneer do go through with plans to continue the OAV series (Perhaps with a 4th movie instead of a 3rd OAV series) because I would have liked to see a bit different of an ending (not just because I wanted *insert name of losing girl* to win and get Tenchi). Still, this movie is a nice little viewing, drags a little and the music CAN be overpowering, though I like the end song. I suggest that Tenchi fans and fans of dramatic anime see this. If you require some battle action to go along with your anime story, don't even touch this movie's box. Go with ""in Love"" or ""Manatsu no Eve."" (Weeee Mayuka ;)"
3,Tenchi and sex don't mix,"Tenchi Forever is a great ending to the series. (if it is the end) But the nudidity and the sex don't mix with the Tenchi style. I was also there wasn't any action scenes. But the character interaction was amazing. Plus the background music helped set the mood. Along with great animation, great dubbing, finding out who Tenchi really loves and Ryo-oh-ki's meowing makes this video a great addition to the Tenchi series. (But If you haven't seen the first, GO SEE THAT ONE INSTEAD!)"
4,Different,"I must say Tenchi Forever (Tenchi the movie 3/Tenchi in love 2) was different. It's not like your average tenchi movie. This one had alot more story and drama in it. Still has some comedy, but not much. I don't want to spoil the weird story it has so I will just let you know it is different! Tenchi ends up being older and more mature than the other movies/series. Has Nudity and mature situations in it. Not recomended for children under 13."
2,Interesting But Disappointing,"Let me say first that the rattle work in this effort is excellent. Strong and steady, very competent. The drumming, however, comes across as amateurish at best. The various drums never seem to be quite in synch with each other and that creates a bit of stress for the listener who is left waiting in vain for the drummers to pick a rhythm they can all agree on.Given that its stated purpose is to get people up and moving, it may work better in a group environment with a lot of room to move around. But for a more satisfying experience I would recommend people give ""Shamanic Journey Drumming"" by Spirit Passages/Evelyn Rysdyk a try before this one. Peace."
3,Basic knowledge,"Published in 1998 the text is somewhat dated in this fast moving field. It does, however, provide a sound knowledge base required for understanding recent discoveries in astronomy and astrophysics. Filled with charts, data and formulae it's for the casual reader."
3,Not sure about this product!,Here is another one of those products that people highly recommend but I didn't see any results. I am not sure if it actually does anything. I am giving the second bottle a chance. Lets hope I actually notice some results.
1,Don't waste your money!,"I decided to try this after seeing on a talk show - along with several other similar products - but I feel as though these pills are unproven to be effective, as most of them are, and actually made me feel more lethargic than prior to taking them, so I've stopped and plan to return the unused portion!"
5,Wow!!,"These shoes are absolutely adorable. They look hot on as well as off. Very comfy, and the cute box they come in isn't bad either!!"
2,"It's project mgmt, not programme mgmt","I think the book really is about project management, not programme management. As a project manager professional I have read numerous project management books and to be honest, I have not learned anything new in this book. I was looking for a book that would provide a programme manager (former project manager that masters project management techniques) tools & techniques to help with managing a project portfolio. Furthermore, I found the book to be somehow expensive vs content."
2,This book will do more to confuse the student,"This book is so poorly organized that even the instructor who taught from it did not go through it sequential manner. Difficult subject matter is not covered in big picture to small detail way, but instead is spread through out the book with little or no information on WHY things in organic chemistry work they way they do, and then it is not even cohesively brought to a summary.There are not nearly enough mechanisms nor complicated synthesis. It does touch on retro synthetic analysis but then offers very little opportunity for the student to practice complicated and varied synthesis. The problems given at the end of the chapter are way to simplistic! It seems that this book tries to complicate Org much more than neccessary."
3,Ochem,"The book was in good shape, just as described. but it took a really long time for the book to arrive. that was a downside."
3,o. chem book,"It was not in prefect condition, there is a lot of highlighting in the first and second chapters, but overall it in newish condition."
5,"Dear M. Saylor,","Why do you post this exact same message under all of the All American Rejects products? I don't think that you are actually reviewing the product as much as criticizing the fact that it is listed under ""Punk Rock"". Please, leave the reviewing to people who have actually listened to the music. (And I know, the All American Rejects are nothing like the Sex Pistols.)This is a really great CD. The All American Rejects just keep getting better!!"
5,Fun,"We had fun putting this puzzle together. It was challenging enough to keep our interest, but not so hard as to be discouraging. Very colorful. We will definitely do this puzzle again."
3,Good for starters,"It gives a lot of good, accurate reviews but also some clearly biased ones. Its good for reading a brief synopsis of lesser known bands and historical landmarks of ""alternative"" music. Good for novice music collectors."
1,Worst computer I ever owned!,"This computer has been a dissapointment from the start. I had to replace on the mother board 6 months in. Dell was decent as far as customer service was concerned, but over-all I stand by my opener... Worst computer I ever owned."
4,Not the most recent version,Its a fine book but what I found out after I recieved it is that its keyed to the First Edition not the most recent edition. So its missing a few cases.
4,Paul is not Dead,It is nice to finally have a well stocked 2 disc best of chronicalling Sir Paulie's other band. The sound quality is terrific. The fact that the songs are not in chrono order just proves the fact that no matter how [plain] some of his silly love songs were they still are catchy enough to be a guilty pleasure worth owning up to. Besides it's great to hear them out of their original album track order. It is hard to believe that Paul McCartney has been recording consistently over the past 40 years and providing us with an enjoyable alternative to some of the angst and angry laden diatribes passing as top 40 material these days.
3,Finally own a clean copy of Mull of Kintyre,"I never was a real fan of Paul. Sure I owned Beatles albums and bought a few Wings lp's along the way. Listening back I realized why I threw them all away before one move. Mull of Kintyre is still one of my all time favorite songs, and I should put it on my Ipod, so I can give the rest of these sacrine ditties to the local thrift shop."
4,Still waiting for a true best of..,"Paul,Paul,Paul....Why is it so hard for you to make a perfect greatest hits package? Where is Getting Closer? or Old Siam Sir? Why the heck do we need that horrible dance version of No More Lonely Nights? Why not the live version of Venus and Mars, which rocked with the best of them?I also would have loved to have some good obscure songs on disc 2 like Temporary Secretary, or Letting Go. You frustrate me Paul. But one listen to Jet or Rockestra Theme....and all is forgiven!!!! Nice remastering job too."
3,Hits and Misses,"It's too bad this affordable hits etc release by Macca is a rough gem when it could've been a finely cut diamond. Not that the songs are poor quality. This one improves on his earlier best ofs like ""Wings Greatest"" and ""All The Best"" quite nicely and his back catalogue holds up well here. On best ofs, you can always argue about the song choice. But what this one really suffers from is an identity crisis. This is supposed to be a Wings release...what are solo tunes like Maybe I'm Amazed, Take It Away and No More Lonely Nights doing here?The most disappointing part here is the liner notes. What we get is a brief intro, track listing and a few band photos - none of which is clearly labelled so we're generally left guessing who is who. With all the interest Paul says he had in this one, you'd think he'd write an essay, throw in his own track by track commentary - just something. Looks like we'll have to wait for the Paul box to see that one. A reasonably decent attempt nonetheless."
3,A strange arrangement of songs...,"I adore Paul McCartney, but am rather lukewarm about this album. My problem naturally isn't with the songs themselves, but rather their placement on the album. I love how the overlooked ""Too Many People"" made it onto these discs, but wedging ""Another Day"" between ""Band on the Run"" and ""Live and Let Die"" seemed rather odd. There didn't seem to be any musical or chronological reason for the arrangement of the songs. McCartney's other albums are very well put together, but this one seems very jumbled. In my opinion, buy the individual albums, and especially the excellent Wings Over America."
4,Brings back great memories!,This CD brings back all of those great memories of listening to Paul McCartney and the Wings in the 70's! It has all the hits and some. Enjoy!!
4,Paul McCartney's Wingspan CD,This is a good CD. I have always liked Paul McCartney & Wings. If you are a fan then this CD is for you. It is a 2 disc set that has a lot of hits on it. Buy it you will not be disappointed.
3,"Great package, but there could have been more!","Hey, We all know that Paul needs a box set. This double CD is great, but it would have been better if it was a four cd box set. Don't get me wrong it still rocks. Some of the songs even sound like they have perhaps been remastered? What happened to, Give Ireland Back to the Irish. I thought it was going to be on this release? Anyone who knows why it was not on this CD release, please comment back with a review.I can not wait till the two hour special."
4,"Good, but could have been excellent","Overall, a very good CD, but who in the world decided that ""With a Little Luck"" should be the abbreviated (AM Radio) version? Absolutely no excuse for not including the full-length version. Two songs missing in my opinion: ""I've Had Enough"" and ""Simply Having A Wonderful Christmas Time."" It does include ""Too Many People"" which is an excellent song though."
5,Great CD,"This is a great CD that I highly recomend. It is a must have for all Wings, and Beatles fans. It has great songs on each CD. This is something you want to buy. Great CD."
4,"Great, but...","...I personally didn't see the need for 2 versions of ""No More Lonely Nights"" (although contrary to what most people are saying here, I actually DO like the song, thank you). And I understand why ""Give Ireland Back to the Irish"" was left off (Macca said it was due to the recent violence there, and he didn't want to appear to condone it), but I still was looking forward to owning the song on CD. The song it is a part of his musical ""History"", and a controversial one at that, and I think he should've left it on. Besides, the controversy may have led to more record sales...other than those points, I think it's a great compilation for people like me who have all the Beatles' albums, but are just starting out on solo collections."
4,Almost a great Collection,"This makes for some great listening, no doubt about it, but..........The original track listing had ""Give Ireland Back To The Irish"", why was that deleted at the last minute? It was only available as a single and my old copy is getting, well, old!Aside from that the collection is well-done, excellent sound quality, interesting selections.But it is overdue now for a multi CD retrospective, with ALL the rarities and outtakes. Come on Paul, it is time.There are songs I would have put on this collection that are not here (Wild Life, Smile Away, Getting Closer, Big Barn Bed, for example), but overall a worthy collection."
1,porque nunca estan las mejores canciones?,"¿porque no esta little lamb draognfly, mrs vandebilt, one more kiss, maybe im amazed live 1976, etc, etc....?"
1,Contains Most of McCartney's Hits,"Silly Love Songs, Let Em In, Junior's Farm...how can you pass this up?Must own music by Paul."
4,Could Have Been Fabulous...Still Great Though,"To repeat what's been said would make for very boring reading. I just wanted to say that I enjoyed the enhanced sound (far better than the UK/Cdn remasters), especially on numbers like ""Band On The Run"" and ""Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey"". Yes, I too miss ""Beware My Love"", ""Medecine Jar"" and ""Give Ireland Back To The Irish"" (not to mention ""Monkberry Moon Delight"" and ""Sally G""), but why skimp on ""Junior's Farm"" and offer up a lame three minute version when the full length track was such a keeper?? I guess we'll have to wait for Wingspan II...Still, for those who weren't there, a great anthology. For fans, it's still a worthwile purchase (especially the deluxe cloth bound edition with plenty of great photos)."
5,riveting from the first word...,I started this book the day i bought it and read it over meal breaks at work and at redlights until i could finish it at home with my favorite coffe in my favorite chair. It was just like a Robin Cook or Michael Palmer book and i can't wait for the next one. I am so happy for this new author.
1,Luckily I didnt pay for my copy,"John Ziegler is a political commentator who is currently based in Southern California - and if anything, he is consistent. His book is as poor as his radio show - both reflect his poor debating skills and disorganized persona. Through most of the book Ziegler is confused, is simly wrong on several counts. I have no doubt that he will soon be fired from his job as KFI if he keeps treating his guests poorly.I was forced to read this book as part of a project - and luckily didnt have to pay. Consider this your warning and dont read this trash."
1,"My God, was Delaney on drugs when he wrote this?!","I cannot understand how anyone could understand this book, let alone claim to love it. It has the unfortunate distinction of being the first book I ever hated so much to give up on it, and before I was even halfway through it too! Allegedly there's a plot in there somewhere, but because it is buried underneath constantly shifting narrative, dialogue so unclear you can't tell who's saying what to whom, the unclear point of view, the shattered grammar and tense and made-up vocabulary, the book is so screwy that I literally had NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON. It was like reading a transcription of someone's fever delirium. If I could give this book ZERO STARS, I would! This book is not a classic, it's a gross mistake!"
1,quick release is a silly feature,I bought this product at Home Depot for $50.00 and it will be returned tomorrow. The quick release is an absolutely terrible idea and I don't know who thought of it. It compromises the rigidity of the toilet seat and I found that it wobbled and shifted too much. If you need to take off the toilet seat just unscrew it from underneath! Pick up a tool! I hate it when manufacturers treat you like idiots. They wind up making an inferior product. When you tighten down on this product the cheap plastic holders spread apart and don't grip well. This is a result of that quick release feature. Yes the cover is supposed to snap down and keep it all together but I found that I couldn't tight it tight enough to keep it from shifting on the toilet.
3,mounting system is not as good as it says it is.,"I found the plastic mounting nuts to be much more difficult to install than standard nuts. The nut is a flared cone shaped that grips as it seats itself further into the opening of the mounting hole. I found that the plastic tended to slip not providing a very secure connection. Could have been just a manufacturing defect as the other nut worked (although it also slipped a bit at the start). We have a Kohler toilet as well, so I figured this would work without any problems. Otherwise great and the quiet close works perfectly."
1,Poor Design!,"I had bought this same seat for another bathroom toilet 2 years ago and was very happy with it. That same seat came with normal plastic wingnuts for installation and the seat was and is very secure. On the new seat, the securing nuts are attached via conical black nuts that are IMPOSSIBLE to secure properly and tightly. I called and asked Kohler to send me the old style nuts but they no longer make them. They sent me new conical nuts which were no better than the first. As another commentator said, you can get them to attach if you push them all the way up, but they remain looser than they should be. I am amazed they didn't leave the old style in production since they work great!."
1,Reinstalling Becomes a Daily Chore,"Do not buy this toilet seat unless you want reinstalling it to become a daily chore. I had trouble with the picture instructions, as the seat was still very loose and slid off frequently. I read another user's review about holding the black plastic ""nut"" tight to the hole in the toilet before trying to screw in the screw and I was able to install the seat. However, it loosens pretty much daily. I now keep a screwdriver in my bathroom. After two weeks, I'm giving up and will try to return it. Very disappointed. I bought Kohler because it was a brand name I knew and thought it would be better than other brands."
1,"Cheap seat, breaks easily","After purchasing this seat, it only took less than a month for the toilet seat to break. Cheap components that break easily. I am looking what else to by now to replace it."
2,nuts wont tighten,I have never purchased a toilet seat where the nuts and expansion plug did not tighten. Need to go to home depot :(.
4,Great piece if you have children,I bought this since I have already had my kids pinch their hands with the standard closing seat. The slow close feature is great and can really save some pain if you have little ones that don't pay attention to where their hands are when they close the seat. Very easy to install and the covers on the back over the screws are a great feature. Great product.
2,Won't Last with Normal Use,"This seat worked nicely for a little over a year, then simply cracked when a person of normal weight sat down. The plastic seat is not strong enough. Plus, installation was made difficult because the old seat was hard to remove -- had to buy Kohler's tool kit to remove and replace the seat anchors."
4,house of many shadows,This is a great book. I really enjoyed reading it. It arrived on time and in very good condition. I was very happy with my purchase.
2,Very poor condition,I purchased the paperback book in almost new condition however I was shocked to find the poor state when it arrived. The pages were yellow and stained. I threw the book away. I gave it a 2 star only because it was delivered quickly.
2,Wire miswired,"Not sure how, but the wire from this manufacturer was miswired. Plug the 3.5mm all the way in and you get stereo sound but no video. Pull it halfway out and you get video but only left speaker."
2,Junk Cable,"Bought this about 6 months ago to play movies on my TV from my cell phone. Worked fine for a few months, but the cable has now shorted out from the 3.5mm end and only plays audio out of one end. Put a new cable in place and no issues. I am generally gentle with my cables, so would contribute it to a very cheap plug. 2 stars because, what do you expect for 3 bucks."
4,Real Americana,"The title characterizes the music; it's high lonesome music at its best. No high tech mixing, just honest, straight from the heart music that has been passed down from generation to generation, with Roscoe Holcomb's distinct voice and style of play. A must for the serious ""old-timey"" music collector."
1,I'm in no mood to be bored,and that's exactly what I was while I was reading this book. Not enough quotation marks.....I hate being TOLD a story--I want to READ one. Too much explaining going on. A big disappointment from my favorite author.
2,FYI...,"...Yorkshire Pudding (which is licked from the chest of one of Clare's heroines in her romance novels) is not a dessert but a solid item of food, traditionally served with a roast. Sort of sets the tone for the rest of the book. I am usually a Gibson fan, but this story disappoints on too many levels."
1,Very bad romance,I usually like Rachel's books. But this one I could not even finish. I did not like any of the characters in this book. If I could I would give this one zero stars.
4,Very sexy!,But not overly so. I loved that Sebastian read her novels and was equally turned on! Really liked the dynamic between Clare and Sebastian..Good job Rachel
3,"worth reading, but getting dated","This book is now a bit dated. The largest impact we make on the environment according to the authors is driving a car. What, in 2007, is the best environmental car choice, a hybrid (what happens when all these batteries die?) or a high mileage diesel that the European car makers are building?Likewise, in home heating, now that there are tax credits for energy efficient home improvements, what is the most cost effective thing we can do that makes a difference?I would like to read something a little more up to date on these topics, but this book was a good readable into to making good choices."
3,A very good album - almost prophetic of the doping scandals,"In this fine Asterix album, after learning that there is a Roman soldier in one of the garrisons surrounding the village preparing for the (ancient) Olympic Games, the Gaulish tribe decide they should participate too, much to the consternation of the Romans. So all the males in the village go to Olympia en masse, thinking that the magic potion will give them a natural advantage over their competitors. But once the Greeks learn about the magic potion, they won't have anything with athletes using it and threaten to disqualify the Gauls (remember, this book was written in the 1960s, many years before the doping scandals surrounding the Olympic Games). This forces Asterix to enter the games on his own, without the help of the potion, against (seemingly) much stronger opponents (Obelix, having fallen into Panoramix's pot as a child, is disqualified forever of participation in the games). A great book from the Goscinny and Uderzo series."
5,Asterix gets a little excercise in Greece,"A bit of a change from other Asterix stories, this one lacks much usage of the famous ""magic potion"" when it would have helped, but the little Gaul manages just fine without. Very funny and a good lesson in ancient Greece."
1,Give it a rest,"Paul is pretty smart! No telling how mauch he made off The Beatles ""#1"" album, and now he releases ""Wingspan"" AFTER Linda has died! Well, I guess that's good for him, so he can get all the money and spend it on his 20 something girlfriend! PATHETIC!"
4,Nice Overview But Incomplete,"Paul McCartney has always spent his post Beatles career dodging the critics, always comparing his solo work with that of the Beatles; they never judged it on its' own merits. This fine collection shows what a an extaordinary solo career he has had. The title is misleading because not all tracks are Wings. There are some essential cuts missing. The huge hit So Bad is not included and neither is his work with Stevie wonder or Michael Jackson. That may be because it is advertised as a Wings compilation. A box set is way overdue, one that would include all the hits but also rarities and outakes as well. The rarities idea has worked well with the Beatles and Lennon anthology collections. It's hard to believe McCartney has had a 30 year plus solo career. Lets hope he keeps going and never loses that creative fire."
4,"Bad Cover Art, Great CD","I have two(2)things to say: ONE (1)--The Album is called ""Wingspan: Paul McCartney (Hits and History)."" That means that it is not JUST a Wings collection, but a McCartney collection, too. So quit complaining about the solo albums being represented here. TWO (2)--Where did the cover art come from? 1985? Easily the worst CD art I've seen this century...but it's about the music, man."
4,The Day of Imfamy,The Day of Infamy was an outstanding story of the invasion of Pearl Harbor. It gave a detailed description of the Japanesse bombardment of the United States Navy. This book tells of all the navy ships that were destroyed by both the aircraft and submarines that flew in and bombarded Ford Island. It also tells of the personal battles which were fought on the land involving U.S. soldiers defending their home from invasion. It went into deep discription of the veterans and who had survived. Now that you know a little of The Day of Imfamy you can read it.Shaun Tudor
4,Fantasy Sci-Fi for Someone Who Normally Doesn't Read it,"Fantasy sci-fi doesn't hold much appeal for me, likewise the Harry Potter franchise. I did like the Golden Compass movie (sorry they didn't make more of them) for if nothing else its steampunk-y aesthetic, so I gave source material a try. The film softened a few key aspects of the book and simplified the cast of characters, but it's all here and then some. What was enjoyable about the audio book was that it was conceived almost like a radio play, the author is lead narrator with about a dozen talented voice actors animating the characters. I'd give the book a ""good,"" and will probably come back to the remaining installments at some point, but I'm not slavering to know how it all turns out."
3,Not for me I guess,"Well, it wasn't horrible and it wasn't great - there are some things that I enjoyed about this book and some things that were kind of lacking - I also felt that some of what should have been explained better was not and things that were easily understood were left unexplained - I also felt that the characters were predictable and flat and I had no emotional attachment to any one character in the story - all in all I will say that this series will not continue for me."
3,"great beginning, fantastic middle, dwindling end","The Golden Compass is a story if Lyra Belacqua, whose destiny doesn't lie in her present world but in a place entirely different from what she has known. While Philip Pullman is a master for his play of words and fantastic imagery, the ending of The Golden Compass proves to be anti-climactic. There were many great and exciting scenes in The Golden Compass, filled with interesting characters but, sad to say, I feel the book went downhill towards the end. Discussions about theology suddenly appeared, matched with a small love story, which readers may be left wondering where did these come from."
5,A THILLER FOR ALL AGES,"This is a must read for anyone. The amazing plot takes so many unexpected twists and turns that you just dont know what Lyra will do next. Pullman so vividly explains the characters with such imagination. I mean who would think of having everyone in the world have an animal thats like thier soul. Only one with such vivid imagination could think like that. Everyone knows those storys where the good guy always wins? Well this story is so far off of that, and with so many traitors and cover ups you just dont know what will happen. I'm telling you this is up there with Tolkien and Rowling, a must read for anyone!!"
5,Excellent Read!!,"I LOVED this book. It was full of everything,adventure,danger,friendship,and sorrow. The people and creatures in it are great and the end of the book is the beginning of the next (The Subtle Knife). It is one of my favorite book series."
2,The parallels didn't work,"The book was a bit shocking in that Pullman used the word ""demons"" to describe a cute and loyal friend. Once I got past that, though, I was able to enjoy a well written story. Well, it was well written until about chapter 20, when he tried to make parallels to our actual universe. It was a bit sad to see how he sees the church, man, and God. His world view is weak when compared with those stemming from Jesus.Oh, well. They can't all be Harry Potter and Narnia."
3,"Okay, a little uncomfortable though","When I first read this book, I liked it a lot. So a lot of you may like it too. The book tells of a girl named Lyra and her daemon, her animal companion who shares adventures with her in the Arctic. However, Some parts of it made me feel uncomfortable, because I am a Christian. The book seems to hint that the Church is evil, and it re-words the Bible. It also has stuff about witches and ghosts. Otherwise it seems fine. However, I don't recomend that you read it. Although it seems okay, it leaves you wondering what happens and wanting to read the next book. And I was majorly disapointed with the Subtle Knife. It trashes God and says he is evil, and it encourages rebellion. It says that God can be destroyed with a knife. If you are a Christian, or any other person for that matter, I would say stay away of the other books. This one isn't so bad, but be on your guard."
3,I'm missing something...,"This might be the most over-hyped book ever. Religious issues aside, this is still not a book for children. It is incredibly dark and unsatisfying, which is typical of today's culture. A bear ripping another bear's head off, then eating the headless bear's liver with Lyra, who declares it tastes like sweet cream? The main character's most redeeming quality is that she is a champion liar??? I'll not give any more spoilers away for those who haven't read it, but let's just say the ending is abrupt and depressing. I'll give it 3 stars for originality and for Pullman's storytelling ability, which hooked me for the first two-thirds of the book. After that, pee-yew. No way I would let my kids read this. I would rather they read Harry Potter, The Hobbit, The Chronicles of Narnia, or The Black Cauldron."
5,Story Review,"Lyra lives in a luxorius college among experienced scholars, non of wich are anything close to her type. You might say she is a ""wild child"". She is also very mischiefous, so one night she hides in a meeting place strictly for males, and she hears about dust. Some love the idea, others will stop at nothing to destroy it. This information, and the part it plays in this story may change her life forever . . ."
5,marvelous and powerful,"i absolutly loved this book and imediately sucked in the next two in the series.mr. pullman delights you, surprises you,thrills and then chills you and i would have to say that these are on my top ten favorite books.It definitely follows in the footsteps of Rowling and Tolkein. Warning! i would recomend this to child under the age of nine because it has some elements children would not understand and enjoy."
5,It was one of the best books i ever read!,"It was a great book, that painted a picture in you head. Very good details, and a great wonderfull book that leaves you thinking about what Lyra should have done,way after you finnished reading!"
4,Great Fuel for Discussion with Your Kids,"I just finished the Pullman ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy. The books are extremely well written and engrossing. I agree with the other reviewers that there is a strong anti-organized religion message here, but I think that it goes over the heads of most young readers, just as the Christian metaphors of Narnia are lost on the average ten-year-old until pointed out by an adult co-reader. If your child does pick up on it, it is a great entree into a discussion on the differences of opinion on religion and the existence of God. Our dinner conversation started with these books and ended with the war in Iraq. Any child who is old enough to read this is probably at the age of questioning anyway, so it is also a great opportunity for parents to discuss and affirm their own beliefs with their kids."
4,A promising beginning,"While waiting for the latest of each successive Harry Potters, I struggle to find something engrossing the keep me occupied in the meantime. I stumbled upon this series and felt I had discovered something special. This book starts the series off with a bang. My heart raced and I *needed* to keep reading. The first books is very strong but has some seriously disturbing elements that make it seem less than appropriate for young children. However, the characters are extremely believable and it does an excellent job of showing how the world exists in shades of gray rather than the black and white good versus evil struggles of the Potter books."
5,The best fantasy book ever written!,"The Golden Compass is one of my all-time favorite books.Philip Pullman is a great author, and I reccomend this book to anybody looking for a great fantasy novel. The storyline is great, the characters well thought out, and the overall book one of the best I have ever read. So, if you have any sense, buy(and tell your friends to buy) The Golden Compass."
3,Okay... but check the content!,"What are subjects like decapitation and adultery (central to the plot) doing in a ""children's book""?????????????????????????????????????????? These things could easily have been left out with no detriment to the story. Check the content before you pass it on to your kids."
4,1st-class fantasy,"Although the plot lacks in depth in some areas, this book has exciting parts, such as the armored bear fight. The book also is promisingly intruiging with such things as the mystical ""Dust"" and the Church. However, these references are left in insufficient detail which I hope will be explained in the two sequels."
5,I must have read it 10 times it was so good!!,"At first I wasn't so sure if I would like The Golden Compass because at the time I wasn't realy into fiction. But after I read the first few chapters, I couldn't put it down! Whenever I had a few minutes to spare, I was reading the book. Since I read The Golden Compass I looked for other Pullman books. I can't wait untill the third book comes out so I can find out how it ends!"
4,"Wonderful story, makes you think.","This is a wonderful story. Amazing ideas wrapped up in the guise of a children's book. I say that many of these ideas are perfect for children, as well as adults. I shall go on no longer. The book is too wonderful for me to spoil it."
5,I loved this book!,"If the rating could up to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars, that's what I would rate this book. The whole idea of daemons was very intriguing to me. Also, the mystery involved in Lyra's parents' identities was a good twist. What I especially liked about this book was that it was written in a way that made me want to keep reading it-- kind of like The Broken Bridge, also by Philip Pullman, which, by the way, is a great read. This book was really wonderful. Anyway who likes Tolkien, J.K. Rowling, and all the greats should read this. (If you didn't like them, read it anyway.)"
5,"a must read, perfect for on the road, or snuggled by a fire","this book along with the subtle knife was one of the best books i have ever read. philip pullman writes in his usual manner to keep u on ur toes. i cannot wait for the third book in the trilogy, im sure it will meet up to its predicesors."
3,"A compelling, solid read","Unlike another infamous young-adult fantasy series that is currently swamping us, Pullman's The Golden Compass takes its readership seriously and doesn't insult your intelligence. I won't rehash the plot as other fans who have reviewed this novel have already done so at length. I will just say that this is an excellent book and a compelling start to the ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy; also, just because it's billed as fantasy for young adults does not mean that the 16+ reader won't enjoy it. In fact, The Golden Compass and the other books in the trilogy may even be too heavy for the younger set. The characters are quite convincing, the setting - although fantasical - is very well put together, and the storyline is generally gripping. Pullman is a seasoned novelist and it shows. He's very good at his craft. At any rate, if you generally like your fantasy fiction grand, epic and world shaking you should like this."
1,What a disappointment,"I BOUGHT this book about three months ago and I only just finished it. Why did it take me so long? Because it ....! The first chapter alone took me two and a half weeks to read because it was so boring! Not only was I lenient and decided to choke my way through the rest, but I didn't hack it to bits either! (And believe me, it deserved it.)My friend told be it was a good slab of fantasy. . . Harry Potter is much better. If you want GOOD fantasy, try LotR or Harry Potter. But don't waste your time, life, or money, on this horrible, useless excuse for a novel. (Wait, did I say useless? It's a good prop for the uneven leg on your table. Or if you need something to feed your fire at Christmas. Or, you can also use it if you can't go to sleep at night. Worked for me!)Needless to say, this book will find its way into the firewood my dad is chopping at our cabin this summer. I can hardly wait."
1,It SUCKS !,I have read this book - I have read books way better than thisWhat is it with all the confusion and crazy psycho violence Phillip introduces to children who have to read this book! It encourages domestic violence and non stop torture! Why would he write such a demented mentally disturbing book?DO NOT READ IT!!!
5,the best book I ever read,this is the best book I ever read. It is ten times better then the Harry Potter books. Philp Pullman creates a fantastic world of fascinating characeters with shocking secretes. He takes you on a wild ride through Lyras world. you never know what to expect next as you drift from place to place until the book ends with such a bang you can't wait to read the next one.
5,Ilove this BOOK!!!!!!!!,Although I found it under an other title (which was a tape version it was a Hard back )I loved this book I think some children might find it hard I'm 11 and I found it enthralling it was great.
5,A Classic for young adult and,"My daughter received the trilogy of His Dark Materials for her ninth birthday. Glancing at the first, The Golden Compass, I decided to give the first few pages a quick read to gauge her ability to comprehend what appeared to me to be beyond her years.I quickly ascertained that in fact my daughter had a few more years before she could fully comprehend and appreciate the series. I on the other hand, well beyond the Young Adult stage for which this book was targeted, could not put The Golden Compass down. In short, after burning through all three books in the span of a week, I have safely stored these books as future classics to be savored by my two girls when they're slightly older.My favorite book was The Golden Compass. It was definitely a superlative read!"
5,"The Best Book I Have Ever Read, so far!","People say that this book is boring at the start, but I found it interesting the whole way through. The book is very imaginative, and do not worry if you do not always understand what they are talking when they refer to &#65533;dust&#65533;, it will become more clear towards the end. After reading the book I am sure you will want to read the next in the series, &#65533;The Subtle Knife&#65533;.Please note: If purchasing abroad you may find that, &#65533;The Golden Compass&#65533; is titled &#65533;Northern Lights&#65533; instead."
4,My review,I read The Golden Compass. The author of this book is Philip Pullman. This book is a realistic fiction book.I kind of liked this book. It was interesting. It is about a girl who has t find this place using a compass. This book would be better for someone who is over 14 years of age.I did like this book. It had suprises when you least expected it. This book is better suited for someone who likes fantasy books that relate to the real world today. They also need to like adventure books that have interesting suprises.
3,Imaginative disavowal,"could be mind expanding, dealing with imaginative realms; after all, look at space exploration, and oh how we project our anxieties and warlike personalities into other possible realms."
4,Epic Beginning to a Fantasy Series,"Philip Pullman has crafted a fantasy world that is rich with detail. A broad cast of characters are brought to life as the reader follows Lyra, the main character of the story, as she travels north to rescue kidnapped children and find her father. I am 30 years old and I was told by a friend to read this. I was doubtful about reading Young Adult fantasy, but I was pleasantly surprised to find the material is suitable for an adult audience. The depictions of violence are definitely not for the younger crowd.I am currently starting the second book of this series which, so far, is proving to live up to the success of its predecessor. Review of Book 2 - The Subtle Knife, coming soon."
2,Rather underwhelming...,"After hearing so much about this work of fiction, I was rather underwhelmed by the predictable narrative. It conveys neither passion, nor thought; it is neither inspiring, nor thought provoking. It is anti-religious, but offers nothing to the reader in terms of finding value, meaning or faith in the non-religious world.Other than that :) the wording is precise; the reading is smooth, although somewhat boring and utterly forgettable."
1,Incomplete,"This book is packaged as a ""trilogy"", but is really only 1/3 of one book. I resent the packaging of an unfinished work as a whole book - and consider it dishonest on the part of author and publisher. I can't remember another book billed as a part of a trilogy that seemed less complete. When Pullman finishes the ""trilogy"", I'll gladly read all three parts of the one completed book."
1,"terrible book, pullman made a dissater",the worst book I have ever read. A very childesh dream book. Phillip couldn't have done worse. The charachters are very childesh and the plot is horrible.
3,My Opinion,"I think The Golden Compass is a great book for over achieved people. I like to be that way myself. I'm a fifth grader and this is considered my book report. This book has many realistic things about life. Lyra, a young girl wholives at Jordan College. Her uncle Lord Asriel is really her father though she doesn't know it yet. When it's heard that there are kidnappers Lyra is sent with Ms. Coulter to go to her college. Before she left she received a golden compass from the master. She runs away and then meets Jhon Faa,Farder Coram,and returns the kids back that were kidnapped. In the end everything turns out right.My opinion of this book:so-so. I have a different taste for books. I still think you should read it!"
3,Slow beginning leads to fast-paced second half... with little value,"The first ~150 pages were a very slow read. The author took great care in explaining details of the world we have been plopped in at the expense of really interesting the reader. The ideas are original and fabulous, but the writing was so weighed down by unfamiliar terms and a style I was uncomfortable with. Descriptions were elaborate and unnecessary in many places, slowing very exciting scenes at some points.Once I became comfortable identifying vocabulary of the world, which was more than halfway in, the book picked up.To give some clarity, the first ~150 pages took me, a quick reader, about 5 or 6 days to read, while the last 250 took about 2 days."
5,The Best Book EVER!,"I don't know how many times I have read and re-read this book and it never ceases to amaze me. The Golden Compass (I read it as Northern Lights) is way too good for just one reading. It follows Lyra and her discovering of Dust, and the horrible things that go with it. She is an incredibly likeable savage, and Mrs Coulter seems to jump off the page, smile seductively and make you think ""is she the villain, or not?"" Philip Pullman developes the plot with such skill that you cannot help but continue reading."
5,Lyra's Golden Compass,"This was an excellent book. Phillip Pullman has a spellbinding way of weaving the words of the story and pulling his reader directly into the story. While I listened (okay, I listened to it on tape) I could see Lyra's world slowly form in front of me: Mrs. Coulter, Jordan College, Lord Asriel, Bolvanger, Pan. I had a very clear picture in my mind as clear as a photograph. This book truly is amazing and original."
1,Skip this book,"Decent writing but the authors anti-Christian bias shows through too much. Our family was not looking for a religious book, but we didn't want one hostile to our faith.Get into the REDWALL series instead. It is far better!!!"
4,The Golden Compass,"The Golden Compass by Philip Pullman is a great book in which a girl named Lyra, who has lived at Jordan College in Oxford most of her life, goes to live with her mother, who she doesn't know is her mother. She runs away after she finds out this lady is really a gobbler! Her and her daemon, Pan, find a gyptian family from Oxford,and they stay with them. Because of the powerful alethiometer John Farr, the leader of the western gyptians, Lyra is taken North to free the children taken by the gobblers and her uncle that is really her father, Lord Asriel. During there adventures there are so many conflicts that Lyra and her daemon Pan have to face.A great suspenseful fantasy book. I would recommend it for ages 8 to 15. Takes place in mountains and watery areas. The book is very descriptive. Chapter after chapter I would keep reading. A lot of the time I would fall asleep reading this great book."
2,Disappointed.,"My name is William Verdugo, and I am a member of the Emerald Forest Association Against Awful Literature(also called EFAAAL). You might have heard of us. You might also know that we have condemned this book as ""pathetic."" We also advise you against buying it. I am a more passive reviewer than my counterparts. Still, I must admit that ""The Golden Compass"" is pretty bad. I am a more moderate member, so I gave this book a two-star rating. By doing this I'm being pretty generous. However, I have a request for all of you people out there: Open your eyes, dangit! Open your eyes and you will see the unfair things that are written in this book."
5,My Favorite Book,"The Golden Compass was, overall, simply wonderful! It left me on the edge of my seat at times and I was always looking forward to the next page. The plot was very unique and enrapturing. I have told many people about the Golden Compass and I have encouraged them to read it. Of course, they all loved it, too! I can't wait until the third book in the trilogy comes out."
2,Disappointing,Pullman creates a believable world in his first few chapters and I enjoyed reading that part of the book. I felt that he had a jumble of good ideas and tried to throw them all in at once. In the end I was confused and while I didn't want to give up in the central character and her bear I ended up finishing the book dissatisfied. Perhaps others will like it more; perhaps I read it too quick.
3,Good and Bad,"Looks great , works great, just dont drop it on your kitchen floor or the magnet falls out rendering it useless. I guess I can just glue it back in but I should have to? Its easy to see how such a small thing of its weight can slip through your fingers."
3,Novelty,"Before purchasing this item, be sure you know what you're getting (I was unfortunately hasty). It's cute and tiny, to be sure, but so are its photos--the size of a credit card. And they're not cheap. The Canon CP-100 is slightly larger but for the extra ""O"" you're getting newer technology and a printer that offers photos of four different sizes."
1,Fish Tank,I tried this with my bettas and they all ended up dying because there wasn't enough room. The one in the bottom compartment died first cuz it was way too shallow. Its almost impossible to feed.
5,into the night,This is one of the best love songs ever written. I still remember when this song came out in 1980. My only request is where can you get a copy of the original version of this song?
1,Gophers actually seem to like these,"Got a dozen of these and a couple solar powered ones from a different manufacturer.They make different sounds but the results are the same, gophers aren't bothered by them at all and may actually be attracted to them.I have had them in almost a year.I believe that because it is the same sound over and over the gophers become accustomed to it.I put a couple of pictures above so you can see for yourself."
2,Gophers still coming,"I'm not sure if this is working or not. But I had a new gopher mound about 10 feet away from the MoleMover last week.I caught the bugger with a trap. This seems to be the most effective and consistent method for me.Maybe it's my soil; maybe the gophers in my area are deaf, or maybe this doesn't work. Can't say exactly, except that I had a new mound close to the device."
1,Don't buy this,"Bought two of these with moderately high hopes based on prior reviews. One never worked, the other worked for 2 days then stopped vibrating. Swapped in brand new batteries just in case, again worked for 2 days now is dead."
2,Not as good as the solar ones,"I have used the solar version of this product for 6 months and they work perfectly. The moles hate them! I thought that this battery operated one would work the same but it doesn't. After putting in three batteries, the units aren't reliable. I've found that they stop working and I'm not sure why. I bought several and they all work that way. The solar version is extremely reliable."
4,treat yourself to some nonexistence,"Plato, Bertrand Russel and Alexius Meinong all to some degree or another took fictional and other nonexistent objects seriously as objects worthy of philosophical study. Meinong, for example, regarded such things as the fountain of youth, the golden mountain, and the round square as genuine objects, despite their lack of phenomenal existence. Ken Perszyk brings this line of thought up to date in lucid prose."
1,Piece of junk,"Don't waste your money. I bought this as a back up to my Panasonic one and this was pure junk. Even with brand new batteries, it kept stopping. I threw it away. Service wise the company sent it right out in a sealed package, but aside from that. Pure Junk."
3,Looks good,"Have not put it to the test yet but it does look good. I don't like the drawer slides at all, very cheap and it is easy to pull the drawer all the way out which is a saftey issue."
1,Horrible!,This looked so nice in the picture but ended up being horrible. There were scratches all over it. There were MANY pieces to put together. The fake wood kept cracking when my husband tried to put it together. We gave up and decided to send it back.
2,Fun-ish to read but words too big for children,I have a Bachelor's degree and still couldn't understand every word in this book so there's no way that my 14 month old would understand. He got bored quickly with this book (that's a first). However it could be fun to read to an older child just don't expect them to be able to read it for quite a while. The poems were fun and a play on words.
4,LIttle too country for me,This is a good Buffett album but in my humble opinion it is a little too country. A definite must for those that have built a Buffett collection...good one to round-out his style. But for a new Buffett fan I suggest Live in Anguilla. this one is just not diverse enough unless you can use the rest of your collection to show soup-to-nuts Buffett.
5,By far the best Buffett CD,"This recording sums up the Buffett philosophy. Put it on, sit outside, and sip a margarita and listen......"
4,Showcases Shanley's talents for creating memorable characters and witty dialogue,"I love the movie Moonstruck - an all-time classic that is off-beat, humorous, witty and with a cast of memorable characters. When I came across this book of screenplays, I knew I had to have it. It makes for delightful reading - and is even better when you have the movie on [at least for me]. Joe Versus the Volcano was a fun read too. What makes this a great collection is that in the introduction, screenwriter John Patrick Shanley gives us insights into what inspired him to write these three screenplays, i.e. Moonstruck, Joe Versus the Volcano and Five Corners. They were all inspired by his background, his personal experiences [career-wise and romantic life] and his perceptions based on his childhood and what he saw around him and his old neighborhoods.A worthwhile read and definitely a keeper, even after all these years!"
5,Good Reference on Basic Law and Procedures,"Tomkiel has written a good reference for non-lawyers on the basics of Social Security law and how it is administered. It goes into some detail, so if you are looking for something light and breezy, it may be a bit much. But if you want to know what benefits are available, who is eligible for them, and how they are calculated, this book will fill the bill nicely."
2,Do not buy this book if you are looking for claiming strategies,The book contains a good explanation of the benenfits that are avaialble but does not cover claiming strategies. The book is not useful for someone looking for an analysis of when to claim.
1,Same Old Same Old,There is nothing new here. The text fails to take into account the personalities and politics of individual organizations and the differing needs of individual B2C or B2B customers. You can not prescribe a cure without a careful diagnosis of the problem. The book is shallow at best.
3,"So cute, but bleed if get wet","Hey there,I still love these shoes, but they do bleed when/if you get them wet. Daughter got some water on them in drops. I ended up damp wiping them to even out the run in the color and some color did end up on my little one's socks. Now we use them as a wornish looking comfy play shoe. They still look cute, just a little faded.Kind regards.Sincerely,Shannon"
3,"Syntax Olevia Lt 42"" hvi Hd-ready flat panel Lcd tv.","This is what I want but the weight of this tv turns me Off,It states that it is 300 pounds but then it says the shipping Weight is less than 150 pounds. How can that be? .The Shipping cost is outragious. Wanda"
4,Well worth the cost!,This book is well worth the cost. You can save much more in taxes than you pay for the book if used properly.
3,Not the kind of book I thought it was...,This book offers quite a bit of history on the progression of auto racing suspension and it talks about the differences between various suspension types. I was disapointed because I wanted a book that went into the details of tuning a suspension. This book didn't do that for me. A good book if you're not actually looking for information you can use in your car.
1,waste of paper,"This book is pretty much garbage. Useless. A lot of generic ramblings with no substance whatsoever. It tells you very little about desing and setup of suspension. The only somewhat useful part if in the chapter about the shock absorbers, and even that is a reproduction of a Koni chart. The rest is, as I've said before, generic stories, about English formulas and Formula-1 of mid-80s. Which might be an entertaining reading but tells you nothing about how to develop the suspension for your car. Even if you race a formula car, there is nothing for you in this book, much less if you race a production car. Get a Puhn's book instead if you're interested in the suspension design."
5,Thank GOD he finally released this for purchase!!!,"Suspicious Circumstances:Been a huge fan since I first saw it in the 80's on NightFlight. I taped it, but my dad taped over it, so it's been a memory/dream ever since. The thing I recall the most:His eating potato chips while watching late-night TV - the way the crunch overpowered the televison. That, and the fact that he disappears into the power outlet on a flying potato, never to be heard or seen again.Seems that this is based on a true story. I hope to find out more once my DVD arrives!!!Never seen the other one (bonus!) about the shoes, so that will be a treat."
4,A Delightful Classic,"The story begins when Flora Bannerworth has a mysterious late night visitor. The Bannerworths and friends soon come to the conclusion that she was bitten by a vampire and set out to find and destroy the beast. But things are not as they seem. Who is Varney? What Does he want with the Bannerworth Family?I really enjoyed this story. Varney is an interesting character who seems to be able to play everyone. The pacing is a bit slow, but it is a classic novel. The thing that annoyed me with this books was stories within the story. For example, at one point Flora desides to read a book. The next several pages detail what the book was about. These mini-stories don't really add anything to the story as a whole and were distracting. I ended up just glossing over them to get back to the real story. I recommend this book to those who enjoyed Braum Stoker's Dracula."
1,Historically important but horrible to read,"Gothic about a vampire running around Victorian England. It originally appeared in installments printed on cheap paper called ""penny dreadfuls"". The authors were paid by the word so everything is dragged out to an unbearable length. This book moves so slowly it becomes a chore to read. The plot sometimes disappears completely and you don't know WHAT you're reading! The characters are uninteresting, the situations (when you can figure them out) uninvolving and the frequent dark and stormy nights are ridiculously cliched. Historically this is important as one of the first vampire novels but it's terribly boring and pointless."
4,Helpful,"I am still reading this book and have found it to be helpful. My mother suffered a traumatic brain injury as a result of a fall losing her short term memory and all memory from the last 64 yrs. of her life. So her behavior is somewhat different from that seen in Alzheimer disease. The book, however, has explained and helped me understand some of her behavior and that has been helpful."
2,depths by henning mankell,"I have practically read all of Henning Mankell's books and enjoyed most of them, especially the Kurt Wallander mysteries.This books is different from most of the others and somewhat depressing. This was not my cup of tea, maybe if you are a mariner you may appreciate the research gone into putting this book together, but I certainly didn't."
2,Depths of Depression...,"I am a great Wallander fan and have read them all. Mankell is an incredible author. I was disappointed in Depths, not because of any lack in Mankell's usual superb writing skills, but because of the relentless tortured,non-redeeming portrayal of ALL of his characters.It left me more disturbed than anything else,instead of marvelling at his masterful character development. It was endless bleakness all around,including the setting.I was actually relieved to finish this book,and found myself not necessarily eagerly looking forward to the next non-Wallander Mankell offering..."
3,Not for Wheat bread,"Great concept, cute for occasional use but not made for daily use. The picture doesn't show on wheat bread unless you toast it for a long time."
4,Great novelty item for the pincess in your life!,Bought this as a gift for a major Cinderella fan and she was so pleased! It is pretty cute and functional. It makes great princess toast. Even kids that normally don't eat toast did when it came out of this toaster! Great item and unique too!
5,Impressive,"It is a really nice, well made weight. The picture tends to make the front look like the emblems and writing are raised, but it isn't. Nice beveled smooth surface."
2,SAMSUNG SUCKS,IF YOU WANT TO WATCH SPORTS OR ANYTHING WITHOUT SOUND THIS TV IS THE ONE FOR YOU! THERE ARE BIG LIP SYNC PROBLEMS. IF YOU WANT TO CONFIRM THIS SEARCH FOR LIP SYNC & SAMSUNG AND YOU WILL MEET MANY OTHER POOR CONSUMERS THAT HAVE THE SAME ISSUES. I WISH I HAD DONE THIS BEFORE I PURCHASED.
3,Not their best,"While not as catchy or exciting as their previous 2 albums, Little By Little is still a worthy effort by a band that was long thought extinct. As time goes on and they hopefully put out a fourth album I hope they can catch some of that innate fun that was such a big part of their previous two albums. You probably wont find yourself singing along to many of these tunes, but its well worth the asking price."
3,okay,"have had clog ears for years and have tried everything over the counter and prescription. This is another product that works okay.i easily go through 10 a day for partial relief. Not bad, not great."
1,gluten-free cookies,"Pamela's products are usually very good. These cookies, however, are not. They were horrible - bad texture, bad taste. YUCK!!!"
2,Incorrect Product but Prompt Recovery,Inital shipment was for the wrong product I received a compact disk 1 GB vs ordered SD disk for 2 GB. Once reported Amazon proptly provided return instruction (no cost return shipment) and shipped the correct product expedited shipment. A pain but nice recovery by Amazon ... to error is human.
2,Why pay double shipping?!,"Sure, the product is OEM, but you're going to pay 50% of purchase price in shipping - good luck."
5,"Fast, compatible and inexpensive","It works great, and is definitely fast. I haven't done a speed comparison yet, but I'm very satisfied with it."
4,dillo's reviews from down under,"This film screams. Released in Australia as REDHEADS, is is fast paced, a bit racy, and edge of your seat stuff. Co- starring one of Australia's best, Catherine McClements (Weekend with Kate, Water Rats(TV)) it shows a younger Claudia Karvan to her best acting advantage, a promice of things to come, as realised in Risk, Paperback Hero, Lust and Revenge, The Secret Life of Us (TV) and I am so glad I have this film in my collection, and I am yet to meet someone who is not bowled over by the gritty performances of the leading ladies, the storyline and the production as a whole. Definately NOT TO BE MISSED."
1,Save your money,"I couldn't get this DVD to play on my or my freinds player; I think the thick-DVD-lable had something to do with it not working -homemade. While I waited the long month for this DVD to arrive, a friend,in black, lend me one of Commander Xs books and I also searched the interNet for this conspiracy stuff. On the World.wide.web -for free- I found a lot of what CommanderX talks about in his books ,again, for free ! (""Dolce Wars,Richard Sauder"", utube search, etc). Why is Commander Xs stuff so expensive and his books so thin? While I believe there is a Alien Agenda, Government Conspiracies, I have a hard time trusting Commander X is who, he says he is."
5,Fascinating!,"Reviewer ""Calico Kat"" summarizes Loveless beautifully. For my part I just wish to give Volume 1 the 5 stars it deserves. I am certain Kouga has more to deliver in future volumes. My first taste of Kouga's work is the marvellous ""Earthian"" and Loveless certainly lives up to the high expectation I have of this talented shounen-ai manga artist. There is a grace in her drawings which I like and her plots are innovative and highly immaginative. Loveless, like Earthian, is shounen-ai fantasy at its best. I cannot help but compare both protagonists in Loveless with the pair in Earthian. They are alike (Ritsuka's innocence does remind me of Chihaya's) yet not, but definitely are characters we could easily grow to love. June is just too far away for Loveless 2!"
3,Not my personal taste,I tried to get into this manga but it was a little bit advanced for me to read. The story is really good from what I hear from friends but it's not for readers who are new to manga.
2,THESE ARE A FOOT LONG !!!,PAYS TO READ DESCRIPTION ... My bad !! I am sure if you need some tweezers to pick up large objects behind your dresser these would work fantastic!!!
3,I wouldn't bother reading this one,"I was really quite disappointed in this book. It was juvenile and superficial. The main character was exceedingly condescending at times for someone so young and immature.The title of the book is a little bit misleading. I expected an in-depth traumatic account of the character's brave struggle with an eating disorder, but instead was treated to a brush with anorexia and teen angst. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh since this is a book for young adults. Perhaps, it's satisfactory for younger readers, but don't bother reading this one if you're out of high school."
4,"A fine read for young, horse loving people.","Smoky is a fine story with many layers. Having read it as a youth, it now is a favorite of my children."
5,Black Beauty = Smoky,"This is one of the best books that I have ever read. When I first checked it out of the library I thought it might be a boring book, but I was wrong. This book is a real page-turner. The grammar may be horrible, but it adds to the setting, and it makes you feel like you're actually in the old west. Will James did a great job with the characters too. It makes you feel like you know the characters, and you feel what they're feeling and everything. It is a layered book that is similar to Black Beauty, and if you liked that story, you will definitely like this. You may not have even liked Black Beauty, but if you like horses, stories of the old west, Spaghetti Westerns, and anything of the sort, you will definitely love this book. It keeps you on your toes, always wondering what will happen next. Will James wrote this book very well, and it deserved a newbery medal, five stars, ten out of ten, 100%, and I really think a movie should be made about it."
2,"Good sight, a bit blurry however","There is some ghost image issues with the one I purchased, it is however not a problem, good brightness, I like the different cross-hair/dot/circle+dot options, overall I am happy with it, I have it mounted on a Mossberg 500 Tactical so I'll be at the range this weekend to give it a shot.EDIT: Mossberg 500 12ga slugging has killed this scope, will not hold zero any longer."
3,ok,The product was ok I didn't expect anything fancy since the price is cheap. but the quality is good I rate it 7/10
4,"Ignore the politics, enjoy the movie","This movie is a tale that could happen, and that makes it compelling. The anti-drug company message is a little overbearing, but it works.Certainly, there are evil corporations in the world, and the plot is mostly plausible. On the whole, it's easy to believe that the events portrayed in the movie could occur - after all, the U.S. government has numerous times experimented on its own citizens. Look up the Tuskegee Experiment for an example. There are a thousand other examples of government doing evil to its own citizens. That's why I was kept spellbound throughout.The acting and cinematography are gorgeous. The African settings were wonderful and felt authentic.This is a murder mystery with an underdog hero and an ending that will leave you in a very meditative state of reflection on your own humanity. How do you treat those around you? This is a good flick with lots of inneundo and gripping drama. The characters feel like real people and I like that."
2,Its advertised as a thriller but no thrills!!!,"Well the story, its a copy of traffic but not where near that class probably as traffic dealt with a real problem that many of us could appreciate. This film is like a cold war movie set in modern times where the local and British government are helping two huge drug companies test their drugs on poor Africans. Of course, just about everyone in the local country knows about it and is involved somehow but are two heroes have to struggle to find the truth.The acting, I thought was extremely wooden. No actor inspired me with his or her performance. Maybe it was what the director wanted so it would not take over the story but if so to me, it back fired and reduced my interest even more."
2,The Constant Gardener,"We found this movie too long for the story line. It was a typical who done it. It was hard to hear what some of the actors were saying. Overall, boring."
2,Warning for those prone to motion sickness,"I can't honestly tell you if the story is any good, because the cinematography was so awful. 80% or more of the scenes are shot by somebody stumbling around carrying the camera by hand; the picture was bouncy and wobbly and the result was intense motion sickness. The director also chose to ""increase the suspense"" by doing rapid cuts, many to off-angle shots, again with the camera held by the person who wobbles even when standing still. Since I had to spend 2/3 of the movie staring at the floor so I didn't throw up, so it's hard to say if the story was any good. I wish there was some way to have known this before I blew $9 on the movie, so that I could have seen something that I would have been able to watch."
3,Meirelles slackens somewhat in his first outing since City of God,"Adapted from John Le Carre's The Constant Gardener was a bit of a letdown after Meirelles' riveting City of God. While Gardener certainly probes into geopolitical issues with urgency and thoughtfulness, its mood and rhythm isn't consistent and is inferior to City of God in terms of vibrant energy. After a solid first act, it considerably loses its momentum once Rachel Weisz's character gets murdereed, it becomes somewhat plodding and tentative.City of God, on the other hand, crackles with energy and verve and its unique aesthetic mood and style influences new films, like this new US documentary ""Favela Rising"", set in the Brazilian slums where an ex-drug dealer starts a musical revolution with hip-hop and reggae."
5,If you want a sleepless night,"I watched this most amazing pop portrayal of global politics last year. I just had to buy it even though it was so disturbing that it gave me sleepless nights. The acting is flawless, the politics may have some flaws but then, this is part fiction. Nighy and Fiennes are amazing as usual and so is the main woman protagonist - Rachel. Hard-hitting and worth keeping for a not-so-relaxing watch."
3,Disappointing,"There are so many positive reviews for this movie but I can't seem to understand why...maybe I missed something during the movie. I will say though that the performances by Ralph Finnes and Rachel Weisz were brilliant. They had amazing chemistry on screen and their relationship was completely believable. The story behind the movie was great, I just didn't care for the film. The DVD jacket promised an intellectual thriller with a climatic ending never to be forgotten. The premise of the movie boils down to ""Corporations.. specifically pharmaceutical companies.. are bad. In this case, the evil companies decide that it's easier to kill various people, including foreign diplomats and their families, rather than fix a drug that allegedly kills people. This is not a film I'd recommend to anyone. Try Hotel Rwanda."
3,"great acting, greater grandstanding","There are times when a film exists purley to make a political statement, and this one is a case in point: Pharmaceutical companies play god with those who cannot defend themselves and live lavishly on the profits of their immoral exploits. Extraordinarily simplistic, to be very kind. I found this heavy-handed attempt at manipulation both annoying and a selfishly transparent attempt at exploiting what might otherwise have been a great film. The acting was superb, but the plot was uneven and the conclusion unsatisfying. Both main characters were polar opposites, which set up an implausible relationship from the outset, and I never felt a connection to either one of them. He was far too weak and she far too strong, leaving him seeming somewhat pathetic and she an insufferable bit-h. The reality was something the likes of which i've never experienced on this particular planet...and I've seen a lot."
5,Amazing movie with an amazing performances by Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes,"Moving political thriller that has the right combination of wit, emotion and noir to make this among the best films of its nature. Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz give the best performance of the year in a thrilling look at the evils of corruption and the ways its willing to stoup to cover up its own practices. Fiennes is great as the wounded man trying to come to grips with the way the world really works in his quest for answers for his wife's murder. His performance is his best in quite some time and Rachel Weisz is just amazing, giving a performance that not only proves her to be the most versatile and talented actresses working today but almost locks her up for a Oscar nomination with one of the best performances of the year if not the best.It's a strong and moving theater experience and it will not leave you once the movie ends."
1,absolutely awful...,"le carre the author was a very good writer many years ago. his latest efforts have been extremely wacky and poor and this film adaptation is much of the same. meirelles' city of god is a fantastic film but his considerable talents were wasted on this joke of a movie. the government in concert with the big pharmaceuticals are killing people to cover up for big pharm since they are testing drugs on africans? hmm no. who wrote this, dale gribble? people who believe that such impossible, irrational, and illogical massive conspiracies are taking place (like if you believe iraq was invaded for petrol...hmmm why then is gas two-three times the price and overlooking the fact that there is enough petrol outside of the middle east (venezuela, north sea, siberia, etc.) to power the world's autos for hundreds of years. oh wait never mind, it must be another massive conspiracy! tm), well this movie is perfect for you!"
4,Worth the attention,"This is an excellent movie eventhough the story does have its dull minutes. The intriging plot and the different personalities of the film characters keep you focused from the beginning. Along with the great mix the director made of both Africa's beauty and cruelty, this movie was worth the 2 hours of attention, which is a very rare thing these days in the first place. Especially for a non-action movie! When human right activist Rachel Weisz finds out about a dark secret in the pharmaceutical industry in Africa, she pays the highest price for that. When her husband Ralph Fiennes starts investigating her death, he starts to discover some things about his wife he had never known. This movie gives you a way better idea of Africa than silly stuff like Beyond borders, Sahara and Indiana Jones. (SARR)"
4,A cross btw lovestory and spy game story...,"This one I have to say is one of those movies that can seem to be a bit long, but once it grabs you, you do not want to end it. This movie had everything, love, despair, and the constant hunting of who was behind the mastermind of deceit. I found this film to be very interesting, beautifully shot (in Kenya) and an all around good story. This movie is not for everyone...only those that can appreciate fine cinematic arts such as these!"
3,Rara pero interesante grabación,Es rara pues tiene un solista y dos grupos en la misma grabación con generos musicales distintos. La calidad de la grabación no es la mejor pero es importante por el solo hecho de haber sido hecha en Washington DC por el Smithsonian y en el 1996.
2,OK,"This was an OK product. However, the face tracking did not work as well the other cameras I tested."
5,Solid piece,This turned out to be a very solid piece of hardware. It is well made from steel that is highly polished on the outside. The edges are finished and should be safe. I am satisfied with this purchase.
5,Super Comfortable Shoes,Lightweight. Comfortable. Long lasting. Had the exact model before in black and brown and wore them until they were tired. Great shoe! A shame they are no longer available.
1,Bad Quality Print!,"I have to agree that these are bad prints. I bought 5 of these Madacy DVDs and will return all of them. I am not usually very picky about quality. A good VHS tape is just wonderful to me. These DO NOT COME CLOSE TO VHS!The sound quality is so bad, I couldn't get through the film. The hiss is not only audible, it drowns out the soundtrack. The picture has weird artifacts that I have never seen before. I could have tolerated them, but the audio hiss gave me a headache. My guess is that the publisher bought a $2.99 VHS tape of these movies and transferred the tape to DVD. No noise reduction whatsoever. Its like listening to a cheap cassette on a $5.00 walkman--I kid you not! You could do just as good a job in your basement with a VHS tape player and a DVD writer. Come on Madacy, you could have at least supressed that hiss!"
4,"Great album, BUT...","there are NOT 39 tracks! There are the usual number of album tracks (around 10), but for some reason a lot of them are chopped up into smaller segments. Its actually quite annoying to be listening to a song and have it stop for a half-second three times during the course of the tune. That being said, this album is awesome, and I would not let the track-splitting nonsense discourage you from getting it..."
2,Goes nowhere fast,"The same old stories over and over. All the ""subjects"" sound the same after a while. Needs something more to keep the reader interested....disappointed. Very factual and accurate though."
3,"Not the Original Broadway Cast, but not bad","This soundtrack does not, in my opinion, rate as high as the Original Broadway Cast album with Mandy Patinkin and Patti Lupone, but it is not too bad. It is incomplete, which was a disappointment. Elaine Page doesn't hold a candle to Patti Lupone as Evita, and the Che leaves much to be desired. The highlight of this album is ""Another Suitcase in Another Hall"" which is simply superb. It was worth buying the cd just for that song. Some of the lyrics are different, which was interesting to hear, because they changed them around a bit when Evita was brought to the US. If you are an Evita lover I would suggest this album, but if you are just being introduced to Evita I would suggest going with the Patti Lupone and Mandy Patinkin cd."
3,Just recieved,I have just recieved this product in the mail and have yet to use it so thats why only the 3 stars for now... I have to say the razor is very impressive looking... Very Sturdy metal with rubber grips... I will update this once I get a chance to use it but wanted to give it some kind of review for now since it has none**UPDATE**I have used this razor now and I must say that I do like it... but you have to use it with lots of lather and do not press that hard otherwise I heard that it will cut up your legs... but I myself have had no problems with it
1,Very Dissatisfied,"I purchased this razor because I read great reviews about it and I wanted to try it.It's a great razor and it works great -- when the head of the razor is actually on. Every time I shave, the razor falls off the handle at least 2-3 times. It is very inconvenient and dangerous, as it very easily cuts you when this happens. I constantly find myself searching for the head of my razor in the bottom of my shower. Whenever I finally finish shaving, my legs are very smooth -- it's just not worth the time it takes. This is not a very good razor and I would never recommend it to anybody."
5,Awesome!,"You know, I resisted buying this razor. I had the Mach 3 and I thought it was pretty great...but then I liked the pink color of this one so I bought it. I just LOVE it. It provides a close and smooth shave and no nicks at all. It's fantastic."
2,Out of Date,"I am saying this as a creationist: This book needs to be updated. It is just too out of date. Morris' refutation of radiometric dating is that decay rates are innaccurate and unproven. That is because 40 years ago when this book was written radiochronology was new. Now I agree that radiometric dating is unreliable because there are too many unknowns in our assumptions about what should be in a sample that we measure, but it is simply a fact that we can measure them accurately. Aside from this point, most the bibliographic references in this book are all from the 50s. It is simply not usable as an evangelistic tool. Creationists need to abandon this book for one that is based on current research."
5,Inappropriate review...,"Does Kelly H just miss the point of the book or does she have an agenda? It's a story of finding the perfect PUPPY, not the perfect purebred!! Where is it written a mixed breed can't be perfect for a child? Her review was not a review, but an opinion. The book is enjoyable reading and a cute story. Is she reviewing the book or labradoodles?"
3,wideangle lens,I like the results - but the shadow produced when using flash - is not acceptable; it ruins the shot.
2,Frustrating and poorly constructed,"When I purchased this book I expected to be shown how to program a game in directx from the ground up. The book actually does cover an extensive amount of information regarding directx, but it is a frustrating and poorly constructed coverage. To be more specific, the author tends to skip explanations of WHY things are being done. This is frustrating when you can not get the code up and running. This book is not the book for someone who is looking to learn directx programming in a fun and intuitive way. If you are looking for a reference book on directx, then perhaps this book would suffice, but if you are looking to actually be taught how to create a fully functional, directx game from scratch then I would suggest you look else where."
1,Don't buy this book!,"I waited several months for this book to actually get printed, and once I received it I found that it seems like the cover was finished well before the book was! It DOES NOT contain a custom DirectX App Wizard, and it clearly is NOT complete. It doesn't even go through Direct3D, retained or immediate mode! There is nothing 3D in the book, unlike what the cover states. If I hadn't opened the CD package to look for what was missing, I'd return it and get my money back."
3,DirectX NOT Complete,"While this is a very good book, the title is simply misleading. The books cover also states, ""100% of what you need."" Is Direct3D not needed? (hmmmmm!)Sadly, this book gets 3 stars ONLY because of those misleading statements. If a different marketing approach had been taken, I suspect EVERYONE would have agreed that it deserves 5 stars. But, readers like me now have to purchase a D3D book to finally BE complete."
1,you call this a movie,"This movie sucked it was like a bad remake of the gruge. This movie was not scary, why do people call movies like this scary if its not even close to being scary this was a of waste time. Just a girl that died falling in the wale and come back to kill the one's ho watches a tape of her then she crawls out the tv, its like the gruge but this is a girl comeing out the tv so this was a corney movie."
1,"Boring, disappointing, pointless","I don't know what I was expecting, but this film left me cold. In places it contradicts the first film, and the few good moments weren't worth the cost of a rental, let alone a purchase price. One of those flicks where the anticipation is better than the film. It never draws the viewer in, and somehow, you wind up not caring who wins or loses, and instead of cheering for a hero, you wind up rooting for the credits.Having said that, there really are some good moments, but it wasn't enough for me to consider putting this title on my shelf.Maybe I'll rent the Japanese version to see if it's better."
4,"as sequels go, well done",Well it certainly wasn't as good as the first but still it was an effective movie. Again Naomi Watts did a marvelous job. Another great albeit very small performance was Sissy Spacek. too bad they couldn't have had her character in more. Anyway it was a solid thriller with much of the creepiness we would expect. I'm hoping for a little better on the third one.
3,Not that impress.,"The sequel to the 2002 movie, ""The Ring Two"" continues the story of Rachel and her son , Aiden, and the horror of Samara.I really enjoyed the original movie, but was not pleased with this one, due to the fact of the direction of the movie. The plot had holes in it, for example the deers. Why were they in there? I did not find this movie scary or creepy as the orginal. The only thing that was good was the acting by Naomi Watts and the visual effects, which had a methaphor meaning to it.Overall ok horror movie, good to watch it once."
4,"wet my drawers, please don't cum through my tv set...","dudes, this wet my drawers so bad, it's like, i'm afraid to write this review cause that freakin ghost will cum through my tv set... naw, i'm just kidding, but, seriously, the sh** toasted by weenie, especiallly the australian chick (like, is she banging leif ericksoin?) ... and king agamemnon is always good to watch... now, one question, if you can go into that world, like through the tv, then why the **ck can't the chick bring some heavy artillery and waste some ghosts, man. THAT wouda been killer! shoot up the fairy ghost land -- toast it with 53 caliber, some sunburst grenades, watch that ghosty chick climb the walls like spiderman. yeah, ""spiderman meets ghosty in ring two,"" THAT would be better than ""freddy meets jason."" hollywood -- listen up! i'm out. j."
2,Watch if only for DEER SCENE!!!!,"Bambi, cute....OH HELL NO. Vicious. Read the other reviews for Ring2 plot synopsis, I'm only going to say that the Deer scene is worth watching this movie. It is a 2 star movie let me tell you that, and although it tried to build upon the Ring to a degree, it just didnt pack the originals punch. They pulled a Blair witch and went Hollywood with the Samara character. But man, anytime animals freak out in movies due to PURE EVIL, its a PLUS. RENT dont BUY though. yeah."
3,The Other Ring,"This is a good movie. It doesn't end in this one, so you might want to wait until ""The Ring Three"" comes out so you aren't stuck waiting for closure from it. It isn't as scary as the other one. It has a lot of interesting camera work that you don't see that much of right now. I like the parts where the characters enter the television or whatever. It gets to be fuzzy or obscured in this really good artistic way. It's like distortion or a computer signal getting mixed into a video that would normally be clear. The story is much more interesting in this one. I'm still wondering what that picture her boss took of her son looks like to the camera."
1,Why did I pay for this?,"I have not seen the first Ring movie yet but I hear that it was pretty good and scary. I saw the trailer for The Ring Two and the trailer looked awesome so I saw it in the movie theater. The first fifteen minutes grabbed my attention then the movie just got even dumber and boring. The last hour is basically just everyone walking around talking about pointless crap and looking all sad. The movie isn't scary at all. About thirty minutes into the movie I was thinking ""Wow this is one of the dumbest movies i've seen in a while!"" It's not even one of those movies thats so unbelievably stupid that its funny. This one was sooo unvelievably stupid that it was just sad. The ending sucked too and was pretty much what everybody predicted. Basically, don't waste your money on this. Just download it or something, no don't do that, it isn't even worth downloading."
2,sorry stuff,"Not since Sandra Bullock had to keep a straight face through ""Speed 2"" has an actress had to endure such a lousy sequel to a great movie. Naomi Watts is in good company, though, because Jamie Lee Curtis suffered a similar fate in ""Halloween 2.""This sequel is dreadful. It is not even a little bit scary. The actors all do credible jobs, but the screenplay is, quite frankly, as blad as a rice cake. Ehren Kruger, it's time for you to retire; trouble us no more with your poor attempts at being scary."
4,"better than the first better than ""The Grudge""",I was pleasantly surprised by this sequel even though it is totally different to the japanese sequel....well they couldn't kill the Naomi Watts character off could they? She never looked more beautiful. Good to see two Aussie actors in an internationally known film...Simon Baker never looked better either.....I must admit I only jumped once but the end is pretty scary Samara is even more disjointed in this sequel.
3,If I could share it,"While the intent of this book is wonderful and in great ways succeeds in showing a great variety of design examples, I found the presentation to be less useful. Sure it gives super examples of designs that almost anyone would recognize, but it is difficult to share a book when the spine does not lay flat without cracking the binding and the print and page is so small that even right side up it is difficult to read and to one side or upside down it is impossible.I'll use it more for a reference book than a hands-on tool."
3,good,This textbook is good enough to understand the course material. Patterns Plus: A Short Prose Reader with ArgumentationYou will like it.
3,"Great Story, Excruciatingly bad writing","I love ship action stories, especially spiced with humor and romance. But this one, my first Lambdin, was almost impossible to read because of all the errors. if the author can't get straight the difference between lie and lay, at least the editors could hire a copyeditor! And all those weird dialog tags--people just don't shrug, spit, glare, or hiss dialog. Every one of those is like a needle in the eyes, throwing me right out of the story, and totally unnecessary. Ditto the mistakes in foreign languages--though those are more understandable than the juvenile errors in basic English. I won't buy any more of these new, only used, unless someone tells me the writer finally got acquainted with a basic grammar and style manual."
4,WHAT A GREAT BOOK!,"this is a memoir of boyhood, in the 1950, about this boy called Tobby, which later he changed it to Jack. This book is easy to read and to understand. This memoir is based on the author's childhood. This book is about this guy and his mother who is trying to get a better life after his mother divorced her husband. Leaving his father and his brother behind, Tobby moved to another state in hoping to live an easy life. Most of the book focuses on the boy, who is trying to become a man instead just being a kid, to protect his mother from getting hurt from a man named Dwight, which is the stepfather for Tobby, because Dwight threaten to kill his mother if she left him, so to make sure to protect his mother, Jack past a great opportunity for him to get a good life and get a good education and to be a kid with his uncle in Paris."
4,The triangle of Conflict and the triangle of Person,"Malan offers the reader a window into the unconscious. He is both practical (as an analyst with an eclectic range of paradigms) and as an author who offers powerful stories that help the reader to make sense of the complexity of his psychotherapeutic practice. The stories offer insights into the worlds of his (often temporarily unhealthy) patients, but for me, the useful theorising emerges from his symbolism - the development of the two triangles. The Triangle of Conflict, with its three vertices representing Defence, Anxiety and Hidden Feelings: and the Triangle of Person, where the vertices represent Other 'O'(recent past), Transference, 'T' (here-and-now) and Parent 'P' (distant past). With this framework, Malan puts his patients (and fortunately for us - his readers) in touch with appropriate questions to ask of their unconscious."
2,Skill keyless drill,"I do not care for the keyless chuck as it seems to loosen up at times. It has come loose at various times no matter how tight I try to make it by hand. I must be old school as I prefer the keyed chuck. On my next drill I will spend the extra money to get the tried and true keyed chuck drills I have used in the past. I don't like the angle that the cord comes out of the handle either (comes out at a 90 degree angle to the handle)- it seems to get in the way more than when the cord comes out straight from the handle. Maybe it is that way because the drill can be put in a smaller packing box - who knows. Truth be told - I bought this because my brother gasve me a $50.00 gift certificate for Christmas, I needed a 3/8"" drill (already have a 1/2"" drill and it is too big for some jobs) and this came in right under $50.00."
1,Product Never Arrived--So How Can I Review It?,"This is one of the rare times when Amazon totally let me down. I ordered this for Christmas; it's now January 23 and the product has still not arrived. I don't know/can't recall whether Amazon was the direct seller, or whether they palmed it off on some other company. Still I'm out the purchase price--and never got the product. Shame on you Amazon."
1,Do not bother,This book is just advertising for her own herb business. Try Herbal Horsekeeping by Robert McDowell and Di Rowling for an informative guide to feeding your horse herbs. My 22 year old TB/QH has never looked so good.
2,muddled,"The meaning of this performance is unclear to me. And when I consulted the DVD notes, the individual responsible for the story criticizes Faust for being selfish. Faustian Man wants to know. He wants to understand and possess and control the universe. These are good things, not bad. But the Faustian Man writing these lines at this moment does not understand the bizarre dialogue and is suspicious that the entire thing is a scam for gullible people who dare not question what they are told is deep when in fact, perhaps, it is shallow."
3,"Great song, not a great single","""How's It Going To Be"" is a wondeful and great song. But the single, as an album, isn't that great. There's only one song on it, and if you get their full-length CD you'll get 12 more great songs just like it. So instead of getting this, get their albums ""3EB"" and ""Blue""."
4,"Lots of good, timeless tips","This book has a lot of timeless tips about motocross racing and dirt bike riding with plenty of photos to walk the reader through the various techniques. I highly recommend that anyone new to this sport read the book cover to cover just to get well-grounded in the basics. There are some more advanced techniques covered, but this is primarily for the beginner to intermmediate rider. Some of the suggestions here will definitely lower your lap times."
2,Very mixed,"I don't have a problem with the sex scenes. A good author can make them work, and Jude did. Besides, the book is situated in a little more modern way with two such young heroes. I agree very much with the others in that Holly and Nick were fleshed out pretty well and were more like the good ole Jude Deveraux quality we're used to. However, the plot was very loose and rushed, with many questions left hanging. The other characters in the book were also VERY one dimensional and didn't seem to have appropriate motivation for the things they did. The book started well and appeared to become more rushed as it was written. I wish I hadn't bought it. I keep hoping her books will go back to normal, but it's been very hit or miss lately. Re-read the old ones for some VERY good writing!Also, it's very much NOT a Christmas story. Christmas has very little to do with the book or plot. Don't be fooled. Jude - please take your time with your stories again!!!! I loved them!"
1,Beyond Stupid,"Now I know why I don't read romance novels. I could not resist buying this book because of the title. My name. If that is the only motivation for buying a book, you deserve to get taken. And taken I was. I quit reading this book on page 20 after the main character fell through rotted floor boards into a deep pit lined with dead animal carcusses, could not get out,and after hours in the filthy pit, got rescued by a total stranger and proceded to have sex with him about 19 times immediately following the rescue. If I learned anything from this experience, it's that I should stop selling real estate and start writing books. Anyone could write this crap."
5,Perfection,"I bought this book to have for some back up ideas while bartending... I use it all the time to experiment for new shots to give to customers. The recipes have clear and concise steps, and labels everything by 'parts' instead of ounces - which is awesome. That way you can change up the recipe for how many shots you need. It tells you whether to layer the shot, or shake with ice and strain. I am very happy with my purchase."
4,"Good book, but came with tears","I love the book, and it was shipped very quickly. My only complaint is that there were tears on the cover/back cover and inside the book as well."
2,"""BIG"" is an overstatement","Must say I was disappointed when I got this book. The book is really small, about the size of the picture here on Amazon. Seriously! If you click to enlarge the picture, it is the actual size of the book. Also, there are no pictures of shot glasses like the description says.It does have a lot of recipes and they seem easy to follow. So with that, I think I'll make a few drinks and drown my misery of buying this book."
3,An Excellent Introduction,"This book covers the armies that fought to liberate overthrow Spanish rule in South America. In a fairly slim volume you will find uniform details, a potted history of the various campaigns and orders of battle for some of the major engagements. As with all Osprey books, there are eight pages of colour plates as well as numerous black and white illustrations. This book is an excellent introduction to this neglected area of military history, and if it has any shortcomings it is that it doesn't cover the Spanish armies."
4,looking good,i am hoping this is a good gift it was bought for a bridal shower for my daughter who absolutely loves cinderella and waffles too.
4,Ideal Manual for Budding Playwrights,"Janet and Shannon Dow have created the ideal text for anyone who teaches playwriting. ""Writing the Award-Winning Play"" has everything a writing instructor looks for: witty readability, clear organization, nuts-and-bolts handling of each step in the development of drama, and practical advice on marketing. What's more, it's inexpensive! I have never seen a more attractive handbook for budding playwrights."
4,good book,Neither an introduction nor a recipe book for level sets. Contains dense information and requires supplemental material.
2,Should Have Known Better......I won't say it,"I thought very seriously about buying this cd online, but then I just couldn't make myself take the risk. Although I am in love with Mica Paris' voice and style...the songs that she sings don't do very much for me at all. Personally, I have been waiting and hoping for a good cd from her since her 1991 cd called Contribution. It seems like she is always about to release the cd that will put her in the catagory of divas like Mariah Carey or Erykah Badu, in my opinion it sadly hasn't happened. I will say though that the one very encouraging thing that I've heard from her is a tune called ""Should Have Known Better"", that's on Groove Armada's latest cd called ""Back To Mine"". For all those Mica Paris fans who've been waiting as long as I have, that song may be as good as it ever gets."
4,Just the beginning...,"I think I began reading these little novels somewhere in the middle of Ms. Raisin's Carsley life. This one helps explain the beginning of her love/hate relationships in this little community. As always, a great read! Best quote: ""knicker rotter"" referring to a strong drink."
1,Quiche of Death,"While this is my first Agatha Raisin Mystery, I was expcecting more development of the story. It has been a very slow start even with a murder thrown in. It reads a bit scattered. I will try another of her books and not be thrown off by my first read. I do enjoy a well written mystery; however, I enjoy it when it encourages me to turn quickly to the next page to find out a new bit of information so I might believe I have solved the puzzle before the end of the book."
2,Paint by numbers,"I love a good cozy, especially British ones, so I was looking forward to this book. What a disappointment! I do not mind a prickly protagonist, but I am bothered by poor writing. It reads more like an overly long synopsis rather than an actual story. Everything is told, little is shown. Characters are (at best) caricatures or stereotypes. There are a number of possible suspects, but Beaton plumps for the obvious. The denouement is anti-climatic.I won't bother with the rest of the series."
4,The Quiche of Death (Agatha Raisin Mysteries),"Love Agatha and the other villagers in the Cotswolds. M.C. Beaton is a favorite of mine for not only Agatha, but Hamish Macbeth of the Scottish Highlands."
3,Agatha is very entertaining,"Good book, entertaining. Gives you more insight into Agatha and James and the villagers. It's easy to read and you can get through it rather quickly."
4,Agatha fans,A bit surprising as to character development. Author fleshed them out in later books. Still a good read for fans of this author.
2,death of quiche reading,I guess I am not into England country site and names. The plot was interesting but I kept being put off by the various visits to English towns. The second story that came with this purchase was a little better and almost made me want to find out what happen to Agatha between to two stories.
2,Could be better written,"The title of this book and the cover photograph are definitely catchy. The book broadly argues that we live in a world in which western consumer culture is rapidly expanding and in some ways, encroaching, on other cultures around the planet and as a result there is an attempt to push back. If you are interested in east-west relations, there is some information in this book that is certainly useful but unfortunately that information is obscured by the verbose writing style of the author. After gleaning the main point of this book, I gave up reading it half-way through because the prose was so convoluted."
2,Overly simplistic..,"Barber's analysis ignores important facts in order to prove his thesis about how the primary battle in the world being between the free market and religious fundamentalism. It works, somewhat, but fails to take into account numerous instances where this tension is called into question. Not every zealot in the world is an enemy of technology, as the War in Iraq has shown us."
2,Gross.,"I am reading this book as part of a Western Civ class. Actually, last semester, my professor was raving about how interesting this book was, and his description of it intrigued me enough to take the second semester of his course, in which he would assign us the book. I took the class, and over the past two weeks I've been reading the book, I'm almost done. This is one of the most boring books I've ever read. Same idea over and over again: Corporate America is greedy. 300 pages that could be summed up in twenty. However there are some passages that are fairly interesting toward the end, so it gets 2 stars. Don't waste your money though."
5,Home Food Storage Bible.,"This is an intelligently written book for those who are serious about home food storage. It has everything you need to know about what, how much and how to store food and water for a short or long term crisis. Recipes are included. Now I'm confident about my emergency preparations."
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed with this book. I thought I was getting a book on survivslism. What I got was a chapter or two of survivalism and a whole bunch of recipes. The only cool thing about the whole deal is that it was signed by the author.
4,Enough to think about,"While the book is sometimes a bit over the top, it is still fascinating and scary as well. One review tried to compare Iran with Iraq by mentioning WMD's. A simple, partisan comment. Everyone knows Iran is building weapons because THEY HAVE SAID SO. I wish there was more documentation for his 9/11 connection claims. It is distracting there aren't any that will allay nagging doubts. However, this subject of Iranian nuclear capability needs to be carefully watched. They do not need to use those weapons to threaten us. With them, and without a response from us, their influence will grow throughout the Arab world. Then all those who see only evil in US policies will have the real comparison that clear thinking people have always seen between radical Islam and Western style democracy."
1,Songs of Life and Hope/Cantos de vida y esperanza,Its been over a month and we still haven't received this item and we were billed for it weeks ago. So I'm still hoping it will get here. I was hoping to give this as an Easter gift and this is the first time its taken this long getting here.
2,Too Much Indeterminacy For Me,"I hoped base on reviews and sound clips that this would please me much more than it did. I enjoy Cage's voice and would have loved hearing his stories without intentional distractions. Just didn't work for me. Neither the stories nor the sound distractions amounted to much of anything, really. Too bad."
2,Funny but not serious enough,"I had to buy this book for college. Although it's very easy and fun to work with, it doesn't have any object-oriented programming in it. People who just started with programming may like the book, but they will expierience lots of trouble when getting more serious with the object-oriented java-programming"
4,No Serial Code,"While this is a fun game and the shipping on this product was quick and efficient, this CD ROM ame with no serial code to use to install the disc. I was very disappointed in this fact."
1,Check system requirements.,I could not get this game to run on my computer because it is not supported by windows XP. If you use anything more current than windows 98 don't waste your money on this game.
3,Okay I Guess,"I pre-ordered this game right when it came out as I do with all of the Sim games. I ripped open the box when it arrived and played on it for a couple of hours. I guess you could say the game is okay, but I would buy it used if I were you. There are a few new features such as riding the ride yourself and the golden ticket goals that make the game worth playing, however, the game is difficult to play and not easily customizable. There aren't many ride and landscape choices, either. Instead of this, buy Roller Coaster Tyoon. It will give you more of what your looking for."
1,Boring,I bought the game thinking I'd be able to build roller coasters and have lots of fun. The only thing I did was waste my money. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. It is not Maxis's best game.
5,"Ahhh, Dexter!",I bought this as a gift. The recipient LOVES Dexter and really enjoyed this gift. It arrived quickly and was in excellent condition.
1,Dexter Blu Ray Review,The series was good but the quality of this product was below my expectations. This is not a Blu-Ray product. I own hundreds of other blu-ray disks that are much more superior that the quality of this set. I will not order again from this company.
1,Buy Separately and SAVE more $$$,"As of 8/26/2010, if you buy all 4 season separately, it's still cheaper. that's what I did. 4 season set is 140.49 today, but if you buy them separately, 126.46."
2,"(5 out of 10) Nah, Not Really","Pretty much an average single to me. Nothing special. Beyonce does her singing as usual. I'm not a huge fan of her singing, but there is nothing special about this song. As for Jay-Z, he has be falling on the mic lately, and you can hear how his rhymes felt like were thrown together on his second verse. Not the Jigga I want to hear. If you're a fan of pop music or a fan of Beyonce/Destinys Child, you may not like my review. To me, this is just another song shooting for the top 40. Good luck..."
1,Never received my chuck a duck launcher!!!!!,"This was ordered on July 29, 2008 and it was never received. In fact, I completely forgot I had ordered until I received the request to review the product. I am very disappointed and so is the child I was going to give this toy to."
2,Smaller handle than old models,"Do not purchase this model if you have large hands. The ""comfort"" series is far less comfortable for me than the old style.If you have large hands, you should get this one instead:Flexi Durabelt Leash 16 ft - up to 150 lbs in BlackUnfortunately, Flexi does not pay attention to the size of the handle. All leashes for small dogs have small handles. Some leashes for large dogs have small handles compared to other models. Flexi's branding on the leashes is poor. Make sure you get the right one. Just getting a large dog leash will not ensure that you get a large handle."
5,Flexi Comfort,Flexi Comfort 3 for large dogs is great. I am able to handle my dog better with this product then with a normal leash. Thumbs up!
2,Julie couldn't even save this train wreck.,"This is a yawn fest from start to finish. Weak acting all around. Julie Strain is the only & I mean ONLY reason this flick didn't get a negative 3 stars from me. Save you money & get Sorceress kids. Julie is a really underrated actress. But this isn't the right environment to showcase her ""many"" skills. The scene in the rain at the end is pretty cool, otherwise it's all ""fast forward button time"""
3,burn em up,Sometimes old movies are not what they were. My fault for ordering things that i do not know more about
5,Favorite Children's Book I found as an Adult,It is such a wonderful and funny children's book. Good for kids and adults alike. Great illustrations! It made me want to go back to Australia.
5,Gorgeous!,This book is absolutely gorgeous. A must have for the family library. Fun and laughter for all ages when reading this book.
4,Puzzles better than the action,"Although I normally appreciate quite a bit of supernatural blood-letting in my gaming experience, I have to admit to using the God mode cheat on a lot of this game so I could explore some of the more interesting puzzles without getting slaughtered. This is a very fun, dark game and I would highly recommend it for anyone who has played American McGee's Alice or Half-Life or the like where you have a combination of puzzles to solve and enemies to kill. The medium and nightmare levels are seriously challenging, so be warned if you need some time to warm up with the 2-handed game controls - weapons on one side, spells and movement on the other. The visuals are stunning and the major enemies are suitably creepy and difficult to kill if you're not paying attention. I'm glad to see that there are some fan-authored levels available, as I'm not ready for this game to end."
5,My computer wasn.t up to grade..........But,"From the little that I could see, and I'm a freak for real suspense and horror >>>> GET THIS CD! Clive Barker has alway's sold me. He is without a dought one of, or the , horror special effects wizards to date!!!"
4,Top notch atmospere and architecture,"Not since Thief and System Shock have I played a game that held me in such suspense. Beautiful architecture and atmosphere throughout. Great artwork.The gameplay is paced well, but on numerous occasion I felt pushed by the designers. For example, I would enter a door only to find that I could not return, or once killed I would be forced to watch the animations of me being killed (some of these are pretty amusing the first few times) and level load to the beginning of an area before I could quickload the where I wanted to go. The experience was very linear.Overall, great game."
1,Stay away from this lefse!,"This stuff is horrid! I would give it minus 5 stars if I could. It doesn't even taste like lefse so I'm surprised it has been around for so long. My mom warned me not to get it, but I was craving it so bad and didn't have any homemade in my freezer. What a mistake, I should have trusted my mom. Please don't buy this, you will just end up throwing it away. It is well worth the time to make your own. Your taste buds will thank you."
5,Lefse,"Mrs Olson's Lefse is an excellent product. Lefse is a traditional food item in my family, but as times become more hectic, it is an items that gets more and more difficult to make at home. This product is excellent. As close to homemade as I have found. The company shipped it fast and fresh. I do recommend this product to all who have and/or have not tried lefse. It is just darn good eat'n!"
4,Working for me on Windows 2000 Pro after downloading fixed font,I also couldn't get the program to work (like Tom above) until I found this website http://www.kathrynwestbrook.co.uk/hebrew.html where you can download a fixed heb_tran.ttf font which will install. After that the program worked fine for me and I like it a lot. I am using windows 2000 pro.
4,HUGE fan of this program,"I really love this program, because I never thought I would ever get to take Hebrew in a seminary or anywhere else due to family and job committments. Now I can sit at home and be spoon fed Hebrew whenever I want. I can review it a million times and it never gets tired. The first time I actually read a simple Hebrew sentence, I just sat back in amazement at how much the program had taught me in such a short time.Yes, it is an old program. Yes, you need to copy the files to your hard drive manually. Yes, it needs to be updated. But that doesn't change the fact that this program is one of a kind.Be sure to set the screen resolution to 256 colors and I think 640 x 480 t avoid having the letters chopped off."
5,Simply the BEST !!!,"I own four vinyl copies of this record, two are a first british pressing, one a second pressing and one a recent US pressing.Then i own a first remastered CD copy with no bonus tracks,so... Till today i considered the first british vinyl pressing the best of all, but now i must say this Original Master Recording Gold CD is... simply the BEST !!! The sound quality is astounding, the sound is transparent, clear, real. When i begun to play this CD it nailed me to my chair, the YES were in my room playing for me! Wonderful experience!I'm enthusiastic about this CD. If you love this record you MUST HAVE this version of Mobile Fideliy Sound Lab,you'll be happy forever!Roberto Appiana,Rome,ITALY"
1,not happy with amazon,"paid for this amazing album on January 11th (along with Stevie Wonder innervisions) and just received an email stating they shipped the Wonder album today (10 days later) and that the fragile album is B/O.. clearly said CD available when i paid for it and now am facing another 30 days before hearing it on 24K, the deal ain't worth the aggravation as all my MFSL CD's bought on ebay arrived within a week, only reason i came here is i wanted this on new, shame on you amazon (just found out that they bill upon shipping but still.. 10 days to tell me its back order !! cancelled and bought on ebay new for cheaper and no import fees added"
5,Music that I love to share,"I've used this music for over 25 years.I had it when it only came on an album in my Head Start classroom.Now, I use it in my Home Day Care...the children love it!!!!Ella's music is wonderful!"
3,OK if you can get it for under $7,"I would have given this collection 2 stars instead of 3, but for under $7 it was ok. This seems like it was from the 80s, the audio was poor, and it was a little boring at times. There is no underwater footage of the wreck, contrary to what other reviewer said."
5,Quick and Easy Solution,"Car CD player wouldn't read discs. Popped this product in, and in less than a minute we were jamming to disco."
2,I don't care that it made my Xbox DVD drive less usable...,"..what does bother me is the complete lack of directions for using the product, even on the company's website!The problem was I'd get the 'Open Tray' message on my Xbox 360 with a disc inserted. It would not do this all of the time...maybe every other time I turned it on. Tried this cleaner disc...went through all of the tracks, it failed on one track, number 3 (tried it again, same result). Does that track have any significance? Now, my Xbox 360 drive works far less than 50/50.I know this isn't an exact science, but some kind of directions are 100% necessary on a cleaning utility like this one. Sorry, I can't recommend this product unless it's a last-ditch effort where the optical device is completely malfunctioning."
2,*WARNING* Not for Blu-ray players!,"On the disc and on the back cover in small print is...""Do not use with Blu-ray or Playstation 3 systems.""It seems the brushes can re-adjust the mirrors in the DVD player.I did try it on my CD player which likes to skip around. The CleanDr did not help."
1,the cleaner is not working at all,"DVD cleaner is not working with my Toshiba player, the one star is only for the not so slow shipping(5 days for free).Don't try this cleaner if you don't want to get frustrated and don't want to waste time and money."
1,Ineffective,The cleaner disk was completely ineffective in my CD player. I repeated the process over a dozen times to see if there would be a gradual improvement. There wasn't. Perhaps my player is simply too far gone for a product like this to be helpful.
3,Functional but not durable...,"It does a really good job but it only lasts about 10-15 cleanings. I got it on a Tuesday and threw it out on Thursday. But, I did get everything cleaned:WIIPS2Blu-RayDVD (3x)CD Player (2)CD/DVD-rom (5)By the time I got done, there were hardly and bristles left on the disk."
4,Will not work if drive or laser is is broken,For those of you who are giving this product 1 star you should find out if your playeris functioning properly before doing so.This product works perfectly if you simply have a dirty laser. Do notgive a product 1 star unless you know that the problem is just a dirty laser. It will not do some miracle repairon a defective player.I have many dvd and cd players and this is worth the small investment to find out if your player justhas a dirty laser before you chuck it. This product simply touches the the laser and takes any fine debris offthat it may have come in contact over time.It does what it says it will do just fine and nothing else.
4,Works well.,"I have three dvd/cd players and the first one I tried the laser cleaner on, it said to press channel 6 to start. What channel six? I went to Amazon.com to search other buyers's comments and found an explanation from someone who had wondered the same thing. Press the number 6 on the remote! It worked. When I used the cleaner in my other two dvd and cd players, it started the program by itself. Go figure. It seems to do the job and the price was right. My only complaint is that the instructions should be a bit clearer."
4,works,"seems to work well tried it on surround sound worked well.xbox 360,ps3,pc all seem to run better no more pixelization"
2,Waste of Money,I used this as directed and it had absolutely no effect on performance of my cd player. Waste of time and money.
1,$50 DUST COVER,"Yes, it might be specifically made to cover your D200 with a 18-200mm lens, but it isn't much more than a $50+ dust cover. I'm gonna see what LowePro can do for me, or someone else. This is just cheap, custom fit vinyl for this exclusive Nikon size. Works rather awkwardly with the Nikon strap, just hangs there. You can do better than this! I would not waste my money."
5,Must read,"In the free-market-world the price for this book speaks for itself. It is not for just someone. Don't spend your money if you still (...) believe that it was the U.S.A. who won the World War II - as American propaganda tells you - while you, as a good citizen, don't dare to question a single statement it makes. Suvorov's book is just about the same thing - what happens if people don't ask questions. It takes courage to learn history - especially your own -- as it does learning any other science.He wrote another (and better, and a whole) book on the same subject since the Icebreaker (call it Icebreaker II), and I still don't understand why it is not available in English. The book's name is ""The Last Republic""."
5,good stuff,"My wife and I have used vita-biotic at the first sign of a cold for many years. It doesn't always work but if you are diligent about taking it when you first get symptoms and take the full dosage (every few hours) it can prevent the cold from progressing or in some cases, stop it from starting. I wouldn't be without it."
3,could use some work,bought this for my sons b-day. it was a good thing i bought the replacement parts also. it states its durable and easy to fix but this was not the case in my experience. we flew it only three times and each time something else broke. first flight the body stalk broke and was not easy to change to new one. they had apparently glued in the original one and we had to take the whole thing apart to fix the body. then second flight the main wings broke then third flight the tail pieces broke and the battery pack had melted. it was easyish to fly. good for beginners but was not durable like they claimed. was disappointed especially for the price that it didnt do a bit better. was excited to get it because the description was everything i had wanted from an rc plane. all was good except durability.
5,Great airplane gift!,"Our grandson loves airplanes. This is a favorite, since his grandpa is a pilot."
4,"This is a good, but not great, single player game.","Emperor is a passable RTS with pretty good graphics but unoriginal and somewhat tired gameplay. I can only comment on the single player aspect, but if you're looking for something new you won't find it here. Yes the game is in ""3D"" but plays almost exactly like it's 2D predecessors. The missions become quite repetitive, where you build up a defensive force then just mine enough spice to create a large group of ""tank"" units combined with a large group of ""light tank"" units and storm the enemy base. Repeat ad nauseum. Often times you'll have 2-3 missions in a row on the same map. It may just be that I'm looking for more than the RTS genre can supply, but this is an average game in my book."
4,Emperor is an engaging 3d RTS despite major flaws,"Emperor: Battle for Dune is Westwoods first 3d RTS, and the sequel to the revolutionary Dune II. Emperor has both excellent graphics, and an engaging storyline, but it still feel somewhat derivative of its predecessor. There are three major campaigns pitting the noble Atriedes, sinnister Harkonen, and devious Ordos against each other. The campaigns are simple, and at times frustrating and repetitive, but the game stays true to it's legacy, with it's simple gameplay and excellent graphics. Emperor is packaged with high-quality multiplayer as well."
5,Outstanding Performance,"Cohesive, melodic, upbeat, enchanting, powerful performance of two multi-instrumentalist brothers in an intimate setting with excellent sound and cinematography, followed by a vintage concert performance of their band, Minimum Vital. Saw this at a friends home and can't wait to get my own copy."
5,Life Reference Book,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I find myself referring back to each section over and over. It is truly a reference book for life.
2,the Bugs Moran Story,"Chicago legend has it that George ""Bugs"" Moran was a rival of Capone, and this spirited biography does its best to make it seem that way. In reality, the gang was never firmly organized and was not a threat to anyone after ""Hymie"" Weiss was killed. Rose Keefe packs her book with colorful detail to make up for all that is unknown about Moran and the fact that he was not very interesting. Keefe seems to think the primary interest of the North Side gang in the early 20s was bootleging when, actually, it was safecracking with insider information. This book is a ""good read,"" but when you're done with it you won't know much about ""Bugs"" Moran."
1,Don't bother!,"My mistake in purchasing this rake was in thinking because it was made of bamboo it would be light so raking leaves or grass would be much less tiresome. What isn't stated in the written description is that the ""fingers"" of the rake curve over severly and are very short, hence only a small amount of material can be raked before one has to stop and unclog the rake. Makes for very frustrating and time-consuming yard work when I'd rather be doing anything in the yard already than raking. So now it's sitting in the corner after only being used twice. Don't understand the 5-star reviews previously! My opinion is, don't waste your money on this one but look for a normal, well-made rake with metal fingers."
2,Couldn't make it through,"This book seemed to start off well but it's well over 500 pages and just kept on and on I gave it a solid 150 pages before I has to just give up on it all together. Not my favorite, sorry"
5,Excellent Journal,"In looking for a journal that was designed for both parents to be journaling, this one was the only one I really liked. I love the fact that it includes prayers to the Lord at the bottom of every other page. I truly believe that my child is a blessing from God and it just reminds me that through constipation, nausea, cramping, cravings and fatigue God has blessed us. Small price to pay! In this journal you can include your own topics but the majority are catagorized with ""family"", ""first, second and third trimesters"" and topics such as, ""hopes and dreams, favorite things, my emotions, and changes."" This is a serious journal and one your child will cherish when it has it's first baby."
4,Love it,"I love The Sixteen's performance. Fresh, detail, and precise! Carolyn Sampson, the soprano, is phenomenal. Her vocal quality and technics are superb, but what I enjoy most is her expression of the lyric. She is truly a great actress!The only drawback is the organist Alastair Ross. To me, his improvisation is overdone and I can hardly catch up with his extreme tempo especially when he played the solo part.The BBC production (both sound and image) is in excellent quality."
3,"umm, isn't possible he used levers?","It's said that lil'ol Ed used nothing more than parts he'd aquired at a local junkyard and the knowledge of ancient Egyptians. Some teenagers actually claimed they had witnessed him ""floating a large stone"" and ""singing to it"". This fits the pattern of stories over the years that say there is an acoustic property to whatever effects the levitation of heavy objects. The Ancients, Monks in the 1700's (or something) and now Ed in the 1920's with Coral Castle, aka Rock Gate Park. Either way, the answer to levitation isn't in this book, but Ed would like you to think it is and pine much over it."
3,"Does not come with the illustrations shown in the ""look inside"" feature when buying.","This book did not come with any of the illustrations shown in the ""look inside"" feature you see when deiding to buy this book."
1,Magnetic Current,Advertising for this book is deceptive. When you click - Look Inside - It shows drawings in the book. The are NO DRAWINGS IN THE BOOK. I was very disappointed with this purchase because without all the drawing descriptions it is very difficult to understand. It was originally written with the drawings included. Not sure Why they printed it without drawings.
2,Not what you'd expect,"I thought that this book was a very hard read. This book seemed to get published in Leedskalnins' exact words, as it has a few mis-spellings, and missing punctuation. I think the most disappointing part was how I was noticing small diagrams everywhere for the sample pages and examples, but in the book, there is only text. The concepts presented were interested, but very few at that. This is more of an instructional pamphlet that walks you through home experiments as a way to prove his theory to the world."
3,Functional,"I had this in for almost a year in my 2002 Tacoma. My truck had power locks but no OEM remote option installed. I installed this and it was fairly straight forward. I did some research on my truck's wiring before starting to insure a smooth install. It went very well with no real problems.The only gripe I have is the range of one remote even after changing batteries. It is very limited, however the other has a adequate range of about 50ft. Regardless, I don't have to use the key to unlock the door.Overall. A bargain for the price."
5,Valuable Lessons Learned through people and information,"This was a great read. Learning the basics of how to stay completive in a environment that is ever changing. He started with $1000 with his business, what if it was $100,000 dollars. Makes you think. Anyway, the book gives you the insight of the ups and downs of a business. What it boils down to is, the customer is the life of your business. Asking your customers the right questions makes all the difference. This book illstrates that point throughout. Highly Recommended."
3,"Insightful, but too general...","I found the beginning of this book to be quite interesting, and Dell's experiences in starting his company were quite enlightening. Unfortunately, this book glossed over too many of the details to hold my attention. I work with computers for a living, and I was hoping for some more insight into the technologies and trends of the industry. Instead, I got Dell repeating his mantra about the three rules of Dell Computing over and over..."
2,The Understanding is better,"This is one of those CD's that are good for one song. ""Remind Me"" from the Geico Caveman commercial where he is in the airport and sees his poster on the wall. It is clear that Royksopp has done much better with their newest CD ""The Understanding"" it has at least 3 good songs. I like Royksopp when they actually create music instead of certain cacophonous filler material.""Remind Me"", ""Only This Moment"", ""What Else Is There?"", and ""49 Percent"" are their best works, 3 of which are found on the CD ""The Understanding"".They are pretty good, but if they really want to impress, they should continue writing songs like ""Only This Moment"" and ""What Else Is There?"".""Remind Me"" is cool, but I was disappointed with the rest of the boring stuff on the ""Melody A.M."" CD."
5,Geico Commercial,"When I heard the song used on the Geico commercial (the airport scene), the song Remind Me was used. I diligently looked for this song and found it. I was very pleased that the entire album is was good. This was a great purchase for me, not only did I get the song I liked but the rest of the Album was great as well. I highly recommend this CD."
5,Unbelievable First Outting!!,"This introductory full-length release shows Royksopp are fresh, sleak innovators in a saturated electronica market. Easily among the best albums of late. The first dish, ""So Easy"" sends the listeners audio nerves to a post-modern soundscape, while the second outting, ""Epie"" gives the album it's first taste of an Alice in Wonderland feel with its schizophrenic keyboard toggling. Vocal tracks like ""Poor Lido"" lend rainy day lyrics to upbeat rhythms. Melody AM is an absolute must for serious listeners of electronica. This is NOT another gay-friendly- dance-club album at all. It has much more of a coffee shop vibe. Royskopp have raised the bar for electronica in much the same way Massive Attack raised the bar for Trip Hop."
2,One maybe two good songs,Where is the guy's voice? That's one of the best parts about this group. Too much meaningless sound like wind and crap. All the songs are different which is interesting but not hit the mark.
4,"America, Meet Royksopp.","Royksopp is the duo of Torbjorn and Svein Bergem, two Norweigans who have delivered a smart, shrewdly-crafted album of multilayered electropop that finally gets its American release (it was released overseas in 2001). ""Melody A.M."" gets the mood right with the extremely catchy ""So Easy."" Armed with a thick, rubbery bassline, angelic synth touches, and a blissful beat, the single is heart-stoppingly loveable and impossible to resist. You have to be tone deaf to say ""no"" to the playfulness of ""Eple"" with its tricky drum loops and sprinkles of keyboard madness. Those who own more than one chillout compilation will more than likely be familiar with this groove. The duo also gets the disco ball spinning with ""Poor Leno,"" and there's the laid-back bite of ""Sparks."" ""Melody AM,"" though not flawless, has jams that are way too cool for their own good. It takes no genius to figure out that I'm pleased with this disc. In my school of music, it merits a B+."
4,Wonderful,"I would highly recommend this album. Its difficult to describe, but the similar artists I like are Goldfrapp, K&D, Thievery Corporation, Tosca. I grow more fond of this with every listen."
3,Royskopp,Took awhile to find this album. Wanted the song off of it from the Geico commercials. Found out I enjoyed the whold album. Great purchase.
5,Pete's Dragon,More Disney fun with a Dragon and a lighthouse family. Colors are brilliant and music sounds wonderful
5,Pete's Dragon,The product was delivered on time and in the condition the seller described it. My son has enjoyed this movie as much as I did when I was his age. Thank you.
3,A caution to parents,"Although most of this movie is harmless, I get annoyed at a few scenes in particular.At the risk of sounding too politically correct, I would forwarn parents that there are extended scenes in a bar, and lots of humor around drunkenness. This used to be funny a few decades ago, but kids aren't used to seeing alcoholism humor these days.Make your own decision, but if you and your family haven't seen this one before, I wouldn't recommend it as the best Disney has to offer. Other themes include the cruelty of foster parents (extreme in some lyrics), deceiving customers to make a profit, and corporal punishment in schools.If you want something as good as Mary Poppins, get Chitty Chitty Bang Bang for your kids instead. You'll both enjoy it more."
1,"The Boring, The Bad and The Awful","Took me a week to watch this Movie. I purchased a VHS copy at a garage sale for 99 cents. Since I have nearly all the Disney Movies I thought I might as well have this one as well. Please believe all the bad reviews because this one is definately a loser. However, I love the soundtrack. It's a real HOOT. Who told Shelley Winters she could sing?"
1,Short lived happiness,"I initially was very happy with this product, but would never buy another. The instructions said you can immerse in water and wash in dishwasher. When I did, the feet deteriorated and made black marks on my Corian counter top. I quit putting in dishwasher, I tried for six months to get new feet. Villaware Customer Service does not put items on back order and told me to call back -- I did once a month for six months they could not supply. Then this skillet developed large portions that would not heat enough to brown a grilled cheese sandwich, I called Customer Service again, they said it needed a new controller--which they did not have in stock.Recycled the thing and bought a cheaper Oster. I've used electric skillets for eons, I know they wear out, but in less than two years is unacceptable for an almost $100 appliance."
4,An inside view of the rise and fall of Apple,"Although out of date now this is a fascinating book that provides great (although not unbiased) insight into the early days of Apple Computer and development of the Apple II, Lisa and finally the Macintosh, the arrival of corporate-stiff John Sculley and the eventual tearful ejection of young, mercurial Steve Jobs. John Sculley's vanity is quite laughable and it provides a remarkable insight into a couple of the computer industry's prize egos. The decision to close new factories in Texas and retain old factories in earthquake-prone California is dismissed with little explanation (strangely corporations always do this -- the human factor). Apple generally gets a soft-ride from the press. Apple are hardnosed in blocking their competition and have let down partners (and some might argue their customers too) terribly on several occasions -- little of that is contained here though."
3,Know where your purchase is coming from...,"The cookbook is what we wanted, but we did not know that it was being sent from England. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but with a cookbook, all of the measurements are metric and even some food names are different. I wish the seller (World of Books) would have indicated where it was being sent from so we could have purchased it from a distributor who deals only in the US."
3,"Love the color additive properties, but not moisturizing enough","I do like that this shampoo tones warm brunette hair colors. I have never worried about the coloring in the shampoo overpowering my dyed hair color, it simple prevents it from getting that brassy yellow tone. My biggest complaint is that the shampoo (and it's companion color support conditioner) does little for moisturizing hair. I have to use a thick moisturizing conditioner (Davine's NouNou Illuminating) to prevent my hair from drying out. Additionally, I feel like I have to use a lot of this shampoo every use (3-4 pumps), since it is a very runny shampoo with little lather."
4,Very Mild/No Scent,"I have severe fragrance allergies and in my search for products that wouldn't make me sick I found these. Yes, the shampoo is thin and does not lather well..that's because it doesn't have the chemical poisons in it that causes ""commercial"" shampoos to do so. If you work it well into the hair it will clean it well regardless. It is just not so that diluting ""regular"" shampoo will give you the same results. It would still be full of countless chemicals that will cause a bad reaction in sensitive persons. You need to get over the idea that a shampoo has to lather like mad to clean...these products do the job and do not cause negative reactions, nor do they strip the hair of all its needed oils. I am glad to have found them.~Mrs. W. James"
4,Works for me,"I suffer from pretty severe acne, really bad on my back. It was suggested to me that the fragrance in my shampoo could be partially to blame. I hadn't heard this before, even after spending years visiting dermatologists. After using this product for a week my back was about 95% clear! You do need to use a lot of it to get a good lather. I have long hair so I also wash it twice, but the results are well worth it. I recommend this for anyone suffering from ""bacne"" or anyone with skin sensitive to fragrance."
4,Colorful and fun!,"My daughter is only 9 months old and she loves ""Bugs."" Not only is the 'open sesame' characteristic of the book unique, she thinks it's funny when the bugs come out of nowhere. This book also starts counting since each page has one more bug. The recommended age is 4-8, but it's never too early to start your children reading will all different kinds of books."
1,Not all ingredients posted with Amazon.,"I cannot say if the product ""performs"" as advertised, as I just received the shipment. But what I can say is that I'm unhappy, even before trying the product. First off, there was the $9.99 shipping and handling charge, which was steep (but I knew about that from the beginning). Then, it took eight days for the order to arrive (which is a bit longish, eh?). But the real complaint is that there are ingredients in the ""Boswella Cream"" that were NOT listed with Amazon, and had I known of those ingredients, I would NOT have ordered the cream. The two ""active ingredients"" that are listed on the jar (but not at Amazon) are ""methyl salicylate"" and ""capsaicin"", and I did not wish to use either of those two ingredients."
4,"ditto: ""buy this for bishop's robes""","it's hard to justify shelling out nearly 30 bucks for a single track. it's only rationally justified for fans and collectors.but bishop's robes is really superb. it's a low-key slightly jazzy number with an excellent minimalist slide guitar part that in its simplicity is genius--a la george harrison. it's a nice complement to ""no suprises"" off the ""ok computer"" album. but this is also worth the money as it is a single source for the other non-album tracks: two instrumentals and a decent ""melatonin.""now if this collection only had included palo alto... five stars!"
5,A must-have for any Radiohead fan,"A very cool Radiohead single. Even though No Surprises is found on the OK Computer album and Palo Alto can be found on the Airbag EP easier and cheaper, How I Made My Millions is worth every penny. How I Made My Millions is a song Thom recorded at his place on his mini disc recorder. The sound in the background is his girlfriend washing up. I believe this song couldnt have been more perfect, even though it wasnt done in the studio or on a good piano. Any person who has anything by Radiohead will not be disapointed with this single. I gave the single 5-stars simply for this one song."
3,Good for storage but not easy to pump into,"The idea of freezing breastmilk in a bag is better than in a plastic bottle. However, I found it more time consuming trying to attaching the pump to the bag. It was easier to pump into a bottle and then pour it into the bag to freeze. I rated three stars for the concept but not for using it to pump directly into."
2,These are OK; Bags are NOT the same ones as pictured,"These bags get the job done I guess, but I don't care for them. What really irritates me is that the picture shows the old bags with the stick on strap (which I prefer MUCH more). The older bags were much easier to use. These new ones are hard to pour out of because of the hole (it seems like I'm always spilling milk) and I don't like having two more things to clean. Also, both the new and old bags are 5 oz bags, but for some reason it seems like I can barely fit 5 oz in the news ones. The old ones seemed to have slightly more space. I don't know why Medela would redesign these and make them worse."
2,lost milk and milk volume measurement inaccurate,"My milk leaks from these quite frequently. the zip lock is difficult to seal correctly for some reason. even if you cinch it tightly between your fingers and slide across to seal a few times, it feels sealed even when not. so they are kinda tricky. it would be nice if there was a color change when they are properly sealed, like some food storage bags.The volume of pumped milk in the bag is actually less than what it looks like. I've noted this after pouring milk into several types of bottles including the medela bottles that came with the pump"
3,Not for use with Avent pumps,"So maybe this should have been obvious - buy the storage bags made by the same company you bought your pump from. But it wasn't to me, I did, and things have been tricky.You cannot pump from an Avent pump directly into the bag (the pump head is too big), which means pouring, which inevitably means some level of mess.Otherwise, the bags are fine, storing milk nicely."
3,Saves a lot of time!!,"These bags definitely save me time pouring in the milk from a bottle into a storage bag. But, they are not such good quality bags and don't close so easily and so tight as opposed to the Lansino bags which are much softer and close much better and more tight. Another thing that I like better from the Lansino bags is that they have are larger.I tried them now the first time after using the Lansino bags and I might go back to Lansino, I'll see maybe I'll get used to them and stay with them..."
1,product features incorrect,The product feature states these bags have the stick strap. These do not. These are the new model with the adapter which is not what i wanted nor ordered.
3,"Design Flaw, But Does The Job","I pump 2-3x a day in preparation to return to work. I use the medela 5 oz bottles that came with my pump since a) it is impossible for me to see how much milk I am pumping into the bag and b) because the oz measurements are different from what is on the bottle (ie, 1 oz in the bottle = 1.5-2 oz in the bag!), or any other bottle I use (ie, Avent). The seal is also cheap and it is difficult to know if it is completely sealed without tilting it and risking spilage. Medela should invest more money in improving their storage bags, especially considering the current cost. Add ziplock-like seals (blue+red=purple) to the bags to ensure that they are in fact sealed. Also, remove the expanding bottom. I think this is the measurement issue."
3,"OK, but not the best system","I pump a lot, and I've used all kinds of bags.I like the fact that you can pump directly into these bag, but the system is not very robust. The tape does hold the bottle in place, but you have to be extra careful because the bag is practically open and you there's always the risk of pouring precious milk out of the bag if you move it too quickly.Another thing I don't like about these bags is that you can't very easily write on the bag (date, milk amount, etc).I prefer the old style ""tie"" bags, but if you are looking for the best bag try the Lansinoh bags, they are much better that Medela's, but you can't pump directly into them!"
1,"Terrible, leaky bags","Well, I just threw another leaky defrosted Medela ""pump and save"" bag in the trash after losing another few ounces of milk from one of these 5-ounce bags. Truly, save your money and buy Laninoh bags. I read the reviews of both, went with Medela at a price premium, thinking that they wouldn't leak, and, what do you know? They leak like crazy. So, if both Lansinoh and Medela bags leak, I'm at least going to start saving money and buying the cheaper storage bag. Medela bags work fine when you pump into them and freeze them; it's just when you actually need to USE them that they fail miserably at their task of ""storage."" I've defrosted several of the bags only to discover -- too late -- hair-line cracks at the bottom of the bags. Of course, I discovered this after they had already leaked out several ounces of milk. Great job, Medela. I will never buy these bags again."
3,Too many leaks for the cost,I purchased these bags assuming that the higher cost of the Medela bags would be justified by outstanding quality. I was wrong. I spent so much of my time pumping so that my son could drink stored breastmilk after he was weaned to a bottle and now I see all of the effort and those precious minutes of pumping leaking out of the bags. I let the bags defrost in the refrigerator. So many of the bags have leaked and made a mess out of the refrigerator and its contents that I now put the bags that are defrosting into a 9 x 13 pan to catch the leaking milk. At least 1 out of every ten bags has leaked out of the bottom of the bag. My recommendation would be to buy a cheaper bag and not to be surprised if the bags leak.
4,"Good bags, but a little small.",These are good bags. It's convenient that they fit on the Medela pumps. The only downfall I've had is that they are a little small. 3 oz is about the max you can fit if you want to freeze your milk.
1,Don't waste your money,Medela BM storage bags are more expensive then other brands and they are not any better. The closure is terrible and leaks. The bags are smaller then other brands. Go with NUK or Lansinoh
2,not accurate,"I used these because they were part of the gift set. I will not be buying them again. The measurement is not accurate on the bag, so I started pumping into a bottle then put the milk in the bag. They also are VERY difficult to close and most of the time I can't get them all the way closed. I started using the Lanisoh bags and prefer them, they are easy to close and are accurate."
5,The best milk storage bags!,These maybe cost more than other milk storage bags on the market but I like them the best. I have a Medela pump and these bags allowed me to exclusively breastfeed for an entire year while working full time. Will definitely use them with my next child!
2,Don't waste your money....,"These are not my favorite. I find them very awkward to use. Several times, I have had the milk spill out of the bag while pumping. I have been very careful in attaching them, but depending on how I sitting, the bag tends to fold and then the milk spills. I usually just pump in the bottle and pour into the bag to freeze. I also find it hard to close them without having milk gush out. They also don't lie flat in the freezer making them hard to stack. I will not be buying this type of bag again.."
3,"Great product, too expensive","These work great, but I purchase the Lansaloh brand, which works exactly the same but cost a few dollars less."
3,eh..,"This book is incredibly pretentious, especially toward the beginning. And it sometimes has really terrible grammar. Parts of it are really unrealistic, like when Tucker explains the class system to Asher. But I found myself enjoying the book anyway."
1,Extremely poor as far as sci-fi goes!,"I have to agree with some of the previous reviews for this book. The book's opening chapter is good, and draws you into the plot. But as soon as you hit the second chapter, Hartmann loses it. He launches into a completely unnecessary and monotonous love triangle, which only manages to drag out the plot and make you want to reach into the thing and grab the protagonist's neck. It's almost completely unbearable. I truly had to do some serious struggling to get through this novel, and as long as I don't have to come across another Hartmann novel ever again, I'll be a happy man. Please don't waste your time and money on this piece of garbage. This book has two main parts, but neither one lives up to it. So, if you want good sci-fi, read Greg Bear or James Alan Gardner. And if you want a good romance, read something by Danielle Steel or ""Bag of Bones"" by Stephen King."
1,Not the best Goosebumps out there,"I bought this for my 2 daughters (3 & 7) who borrowed a goosebumps video from a friend and loved it. We bought 3 goosebumps episodes based on the reviews (Chillogy, Deep Trouble, Scary House). Chillogy was terrible. It was neither scary (in the goosebumps way) nor very interesting. It was really more of a super-weak attempt at a twilight zone episode for kids that I would guess was done to have enough episodes for a season. The other two Goosebumps were exactly what we expected. They were scary in a kid-friendly way and had stories that kept the kids engaged. I would highly recommend Deep Trouble & Scary House for younger kids. If you really want to check out Chillogy, rent it before buying."
5,One of the best Hardy Boys mysteries I have ever read,The resivwore for Bayport is being drained every night by a unknown source. And the Hardy's think it has to do with a powerful gang in Chicago. The book was so exciting I read it in 4 days.
4,"IT GROWS ON YOU,DEFF. WORTH A LOOK THO","watchd this yesterday with my gf and we both liked it, its not the best nor the worse movie, but as the film goes on you get pulled in and want to know what happens to them and really want to know whats really outside, some other reviewers said theres intense rape scenes and violance, which i dont think its true. now the scenes from the last house on the left are some really messed up scenes, this is deff. not a kids movie, but a movie for grownups that shows that this could really happen in this day and edge, thats more scary then anything"
3,Cool,"I really enjoy these kind of movies and this was from the director of Frontiers and while it isn't as good it's still enjoyable if not a little overly long, but has a very strong cast"
2,Should have been a short,"Let me say that I'm a big fan of post-apocalyptic films. I love witnessing a creative team's vision come to life on the screen as they tackle the complexities of contemporary humans in futuristic, lawless societies.However, The Divide just didn't do it for me. It focuses on what happens when people are locked in a small space together and lacks nuance in that treatment. It reminded me more of a hatchet horror film than the psychological thriller it wants to be. The Divide intentionally feels claustrophobic, but unfortunately it's equally cramped in its ability to challenge the viewer.This movie should have been a short, 30-minute film focusing on fewer, more sympathetic characters. Instead it's a long mess with nothing to grab on to. (Felt like one star, but giving it two for the acting.)"
1,Post-Apocalyptic Porn,"The basic idea of this film is that if dozen strangers are trapped in a basement following a nuclear strike, they'll turn into raving sexual monsters. This thing is as close to a snuff film as it gets, with Roseann Arquette submitting herself to one of the most degrading roles ever filmed. I'm no prude, by a long shot, but if someone were to tell me they watched this movie twice, I'd take out a restraining order."
1,Don't waste your time,"This movie is a complete waste of time. Humans can be dark, but a real life scenario wouldn't play out like this. Everyone that didn't give this film one star is misguided or maybe follows Tom Cruise's religion. Idiotas."
1,Not too good,"This movie starts OK, and gets a little better as things go on to a point. Then it's obvious the writer had no idea what to do after that and then the movie devolves into your stereo typical survivor horror story. Why people stand around letting one or two others rape and torture when they can just subdue the crazy ones makes no sense. I assume it was the Directors failed attempt to shock the audience instead of answering questions about the original attackers of the City."
3,Okay,"The premise is good. The US is nuked and a small group of people take shelter in the basement of an apt complex. But I really dont like any of the characters here. They behave in a way which to me is not realistic. Maybe it makes for a good movie, but I would rather see people behaving realistically in the situation. Working together and try to manage through the ordeal. The characters here are dumb and insane, particularly the 2 guys who become the 'leaders'. And what is up with the guys with chunks of hair shaved out of their head? Was that suppose to be their hair falling out as result of the radiation? I hope not cus that looked ridiculous. Overall the movie was okay but definitely could have been done better."
4,"Great, unexpected hard- hitting film.","This post- apocalyptic gem was very disturbing, but was also equally refreshing- as opposed to most of the uncreative mysteries, and formula "" slice and dice "" and "" walking dead "" type horror movies of today. The writing was good; but the real genius was Gen's direction, and the brilliant casting.I had the same type of reaction with Stanley kubrick's "" A Clockwork Orange "" - Appalled at first by the brutality, but recognizing the truisms and parallels along with the "" Lord Of The Flies "" Scenario. Many people believe that they would do the "" right thing "" if in a similar situation, but unless you really posses a large slice of leadership qualities- ( unlike "" Sam "", who wimps out ) you might fall in line with the rest of the bad guys.As stated by the man with no name in the movie "" High plains Drifter "" - "" It's what people know about themselves that really scares them "" .Enjoy the movie."
2,I rented this movie from the library:,"And I am now sorry that I did because in many respects it was and is horrible and I won't likely be renting it again, I cannot understand for the life of me why the actress Rosanna Arquette would want to portray herself in the matters and manners as this only to be killed by those two creep brothers that she did in this film even of she is acting, maybe she's wasked up as an actress now or this film will do it to her. I agree with the synopsis in the trailers that this is a film that is relentless in parts and does not give up but the violence is overwroght. And they did not explain what the people in the hazmat suits were doing with the bodies of the children that were in the cryogenic chambers after they took the daughter of the character being played by Arquette. It's like a claustrophobic type movie."
2,Disgusting,Whoever is responsible for this needs therapy. It had basically no plot. The scenarios just repeated themselves until everyone had gone crazy.
1,Suck It,"Pure disgusting. One of the worst movies of all time. If you are demented and want to puke, this movie is for you. Wish I didn't even have to give it a star, but amazon makes ya! Thee one and only good thing about this film was the last song played while the credits were rolling. Good luck."
2,Too much scientific approach,"I was quite dissapointing by this book as it contains lot of pages but only a few important messages. If Mr Pelz would put these on one A4 sheet, it would be more appropriate. If you look for organised and clear putting teaching book, do not buy this book!"
1,His Best Album Ever!,"A CD full of totally unenjoyable songs. By this time, his ego had exceed his talent."
2,Smells like semen and doesn't do much,"I didn't really notice anything from this pill, maybe it does work but I haven't noticed anything. It's weird how it smells like semen too, and 50 bucks this product is a rip off"
2,Kuijken's EXCERPTS from Bach's B Minor Mass,"There's not much to say about this, except that it is excerpts on one CD, recorded in Guanajuato, Mexico, and neither the information from the record dealers nor from the publisher mentions this severe limitation. Who wants to buy EXCERPTS of a work of this scope and beauty, performed under a conductor as promising as Sigiswald Kuijkens? Why on earth didn't they record the whole work?"
3,plot break down,"Before I start I would like to point out the budget for this film, it was $2million and it shows. But don't give up on it, it has an exellent performance by lead man Nicholas Lea of X-Files fame and Bobby Dawson & Mark Hamill don't do bad either. It has a very original script were two friends (Lea & Dawson) devise a plan to raffle a grand prize of a date with the most beutiful woman in the world, after a long hard search they find a ""beutiful woman"" but have trouble getting the world to accept the conclusion that she is the most beutiful woman they finaly reach the big day of the raffle and all goes wrong. I dont want to spoil the ending for you so get this film and see for yourself."
2,Recoil kills this scope,"I mounted the banner 6-24 on a Rem 700V 308. It worked ok for about 110 rounds. Apparently recoil killed it. When I would fire, the scope would blur slightly. It would not hold zero anymore. I wasted a box of custom loads trying to figure it out. Took it off and shook it, and there is pieces rattling around inside. I am sending it back to Bushnell for warranty. They say it was shock tested on, and rated to, a .375 caliber... whatever that means. If they choose to fix it I might try it on my 243, but its probably more suited for a very small caliber gun. Go with a Nikon or Leupold. You wont regret it in the long run."
3,Herc Was Cool,"This is a very badly acted film, but it's still fun to watch, maybe partly for that. This is what started all the muscle guy movies. If you take this seriously, you'll vomit. The dubbing alone is enough to get your stomach churning. Have your friend talk while you move your lips, not knowing what your friend will say, & you get the idea. Anyway, the main reason for this film is to show off Steve Reeves' great build. He's buff & tuff. Herc's cool. If you watch this with the same attitude as looking at an old comic book, you'll like it, I think."
2,"Nostalgic films, poor transfer","Wish the Steve Reeves Hercules films were just a little more robust than they are: Reeves is magnificent to look at, and the women are beautiful. But somehow, these Hercules films don't create the same feeling in people that they get from Harryhausen's ""Jason and the Argonauts"", and the more elaborate spectacles like ""Ben Hur"". Fans of Reeves, and the genre, may object most to the pan-and-scan versions of these movies presented here. Bad prints, too, and this is a shame, because the color photography and widescreen were a huge part of the appeal of these amiably modest spectacles. If you've been waiting for ""Hercules"" to come out on a restored DVD, this isn't it, sadly. Reeves and his fans deserved better."
3,Great old classic Hercules,"Mind you, the film is still enjoyable along the way but also rather juvenile and uninspired but you have to remember, this is from 1958. When I was a young kid, the classics, mythical period was fascinating. Overall, its still worth watching."
5,I finally got to use it.,"I used this just last week in the midst of a significant snowfall. Now granted, the snow was light and fluffy (both the air and the surface of the driveway were very cold) but this allowed for very easy pushing, and I have no doubt that I was able to clear my fairly large driveway about as fast as I would be able to with a snow blower."
1,"Outdated (2000), tiny (79 pages) booklet","Complete disappointment is all I got from this tiny booklet. In the fast changing and very competitive cruise industry to rely on amazingly outdated booklet (2000), which barely scratch on the surface of so huge topics such as ""How to get a cruise ship job?"" and ""What is to work onboard a cruise ship?"" will only lead to application failures and disappointments.That's why if you want complete, step-by-step, professional-grade instructions on impact cover letter and resume writing as well as acing an interview you can find them only in ""Cruise Ship Job in 14 Days"". Otherwise if you are looking for a book which focuses on the life onboard and contains many stories of people who have worked on a cruise ship the best two are ""Working on Cruise Ship"" and ""How to get a job with a Cruise line and travel around the world""."
1,Why this small book is ridiculous,"5 long years this small book has NOT been updated! Can you imagine? This is the reason why most of the addresses, telephone and fax numbers are outdates and useless. When I read the company profiles there were cruise lines, which don't even exist any more due to mergers in the last 2 years. Personally I will return this book with information from 5 years ago after I found it out. Since you need the latest information on cover letter and resume writing as well as the current contact details of the cruise lines, buying this book is like buying newspaper from 5 years ago!"
5,PHONE CALL FROM A GHOST,"This book is so great. I have read it so many times because I think these kinds of things are cool. My fave story in this book was the one about the Hermit, it was amazing, but I believe it. If you like this book, and this sort of stuff, I think you should also read ""CIVAL WAR GHOSTS"" it's also a good book."
3,The Almighty Radio Edit is really good!,"This CD contains 3 tracks. They include ""To the Moon & Back,"" ""TTMAB (Almighty Radio Edit),"" and ""Truly Madly Deeply (Karaoke Version)."" It does not come with a poster. The Almighty Radio Edit is really good. I don't want another person to get confused this CD with the other Pt. 2."
5,This is the ruler by which capoeira music is measured!,"I could write volumes and volumes about how brilliant this CD is. I've amassed a collection of about 40 capoeira CDs and I'd have to say this is just about the best one.From this CD, you can learn many of the traditional capoeira songs as sung by one of the most amazing voices that the genre has known. Enthusiasm, energy, and authenticity...it's all wrapped in Suassuna's voice.Get it while it's still available. You won't regret it!"
1,This book is confusing at best and misleading at worst.,"This book's purpose is confusing. It is not a complete guide to Wing Chun, but focuses on obscure and marginal branches and instructors. The most influential and authentic teachers are either not mentioned or given short shrift. The authors promote themselves as experts, asserting their authority in the unattributed assertions and overgeneralizations. No proper critical appraisal of different schools or approaches is given; as if each school discussed gave their students the same benefits, which they do not. Like many of the highlighted ""teachers,"" the book is too commercial without any depth. Its simple premise is ""It's all Wing Chun,"" as if one branch and another are interchangable despite the shortcomings of these minor offshoots. Do not waste your money."
1,"these guys do not have a clue, buy this book for a laugh!","From the school of silly training and funny shoes, the author appears to be so far up his own behind he can't see the light of day!"
2,"Complete Wing Chun? No, not really.",Yip Man's lineage is most dominant today. I expected more in this branch. Most intriguing is who the authors chose to exclude even a mention from the book - including (among others) Moy Yat.
2,Think twice about this phone,"I purchased this phone after seeing that it was the top rated model by Consumer Reports. Though quite happy with the phone's initial performance, the problem comes in that it prematurely decides to stop performing. I ordered a replacement handset after one (of the two) that came with my system died after approx 9 mos. Oddly enough, the replacement handset I ordered was dead on arrival. I sent it back for a refund and decided enough was enough - I switched to a different phone model/manufacturer."
1,Purchase At Own Risk,"This phone has been nothing but a total dud. It's that simple.Our first one died and my wife loved the ring tones enoughto want to me to buy another one, which I did with the greathesitation due to the fact that the first one had issues, i.e:the audio would cut in and out,and a strange delay effectwould randomly occur during conversations.But I figured my particular phone was probably just a lemonand that if I got a new one it would work fine. Wrong! Afterhooking up and using the new phone (identical model), we soondiscovered that it had the exact same problems as the first.My advise? There's a thousand and one phones to choosefrom out there... don't make this one of them!"
4,Whew!,"Forget Anna Nicole Smith, silicon crazed superstar of midnight fantasy. Athena Massey rules! I don't even remember the plot of this film very much. Something about a psycho john getting blackmailed in a bordello. Massey was strutting around in and out of her costume so much, I think it effected my short-term memory. Massey fans, flock to this one in droves!"
4,Crazy Moon,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The characters were quirky, the music was terrific and complemented the story which was sweet and unpredictable. Kiefer was so completely different in this movie, but different in a good way. Loved it!"
4,Great book,I don't understand why anyone would say that this book defends the cause of Tim McVeigh. I don't see that at all. This book shows me how warped Tim McVeigh's thinking was. He is a lost man with a warped since of justice.
1,Edit: DON'T BUY! They cause permanent stains!,"I previously gave the markers four stars, but after using them for a longer amount of time, I'm giving them one star. Like I said in my previous review, the colors are too light, and they are also pretty tiny. If you keep your board on the refrigerator like I do, then the markers will fall off if you shut the door. The blue one fell off one day, and the magnet broke off. What REALLY made me mad and why I'm giving this a one-star rating is that it permanently stained my board. I've tried using the erasers, I've tried using water and scrubbing at it with a paper towel, but the marker stains just won't come off! I'm very upset. Now, I have to buy a new dry erase board!"
2,Not worth value,I could have gotton better at dollar store. Ink is weak and pens are low quality. The eraser ends are sure to fall off when you recieve them. You're better off going to Target and getting a name brand set for the same price.
4,They are what they are,"I must have gotten a fresh batch because the ink was quite good. They write longer than I expected. I'm used to fine-point markers drying out mid sentence, but these held up well.The eraser on the cap is not new or exclusive, but it works and is handier than a big eraser, and a lot better than using your finger (which is a no-no if you want your white board to last).The colors are not as bright as the caps, but they are accurate. For instance, rather than creamsicle, it's more like a conventional orange. The deeper color lets it stand out on white. They would ""disappear"" at a distance if they were truly that light.These came in handy while cramming for a test. I like to write it all out on a big white board instead of sheets of paper, so I can digest it all at once when I'm done. The assortment of colors allowed me to color-code the notes.Bottom line: Very solid product, but not exceptional."
1,don't always erase,"One star for being such a nice small size. & for the great, vibrant colors.BUT....they didn't come off the wipe board. So for dry erase pens, they DONT erase.When I tried to erase with the included black foam eraser on each pen tip & then with paper towel, the color spread & stained the board.Then using cleanser, it made no change...;(So sorry about it too, they are the perfect size for my son & his travel wipe board kit (the pens that came with it, of course dried up) ."
3,"Very bright, not always easy to erase","These are fun to use because they are so bright, but the little ""erasers"" at the top certainly aren't practical. They bend with even the littlest pressure and make erasing a long and annoying task. Just use a regular eraser. Also, if you don't erase right away (sometimes we leave things on the board for a week or so), you need to get some windex to get the color off. Also, the ""mini"" size is a little hard to write with at times. The colors are fun though and it might be nice for little hands in a long car ride (no big odor)."
3,Whiteboard markers,"These markers are very small . Not nearly the same size as other whiteboard markers with erasers that I have previously purchased. The markers are ok, but are way too small. There is a nice variety of colors."
3,"Not too bad, but...","I was really excited to receive these dry erase markers as I began my second semester of college. I needed more colors than just the black that came with my dry erase board, so I knew these would be perfect. Long story short, as I was testing all the markers, everyone worked great except for the purple that wrote in blue. All other markers work great except for my ""purple."""
4,"I grew up about one mile from Where the Bowling,s live now.","Hello. The main character in this book stayed with my mother when my youngest sister was borned. Iree that is,so I know very well how and what this book and document on HBO is like.In fact my mother and two sisters live now less than two miles from Bass and Iree Bowling.Even though I live in another state ,,I go back and visit my mother very often. Also I always go back for the Home coming at Labor Day Weekend every year. Yes this is the way of the mountian people but,we are very proud of our hertage. Also most have running water and modern conviences now days too. However the Bowling family lives just like the book says. How do I know? You say! Because I know them very personally. P. Woods Ps..Very good work Rory.."
3,The Audio Version is Difficult in the Beginning,"The story is interesting and has good information about the Chinese, but the narrator requires adjustment for Westerners. It sounds as if she is reading from the book, and her voice keeps going up, even at the end of sentences. A western voice goes down at the end of a sentence, unless asking a question. She also talks fast at times, and her breath is tense. The dialogue between characters is good. If you are aware that she may be using the style, accent, and diction of the Chinese, this will help. It may be that this audio book has been produced for the Chinese in America or those of Chinese decent. I have heard many educated Chinese who speak excellent English who do not adopt this style. Lisa See gives a good perspective on Chinese life."
5,Great Read!,"It is well written, with an intriguing story. It is the third in the Red Princess Mystery series, so now I am reading the one that precedes it!"
3,Scooby Dumb,"This was not the greatest release from Thizz entertainment. It is a mix of a majority of older material with some newer stuff. (by older I mean stuff recorded while MAC DRE was alive) After listening to this release I think that Dubee, PSD, and Rydah J Klyde is da dopest out the crew. While Mistah FAB sounded nice as hell. I thought he was gay or something, but he spits more like MD on his cut I dont Know than any other Thizzims. ImeanImean."
5,mui buen libro,"Este es un libro que te hace pensar en ti realmente. En lo que haces, lo que no haces y lo que puedes hacer. Escrito en historias pequeñas, es mui facil de leer.Le agradesco a un amigo la recomendacion."
1,"An ""eye opener"".","I decided to buy this book to have a different, more esoteric view of music. If you desire to view this theme on a natural or more scientific perspective, this is not the correct book.An author who poses himself like THE ALL, writing as if he knew the distant future, as well as pinpoint our erroneous conceptions of how we see music to-day (which he does), can give a very interesting perspective. Yet, interesting perspectives must obviously provide the perspective which is at stake. One cannot just pose the question and then evade the answer by writting something as shallow as, ""you will find the answer as you evolve as a race""....A sad-hungry hippie wrote this book. Yet I must admitt that it is an excellent midnight-bathroom book!!"
1,I LOVE this stuff BUT!!,"I love this stuff but, I recieved it with only two months before it expires. The expiration date is in two months. This is the only negative thing about this product."
5,Bow to the Almighty Tallest!,"One of the greatest shows that Nickelodeon had to offer. Our hero (or villian?) Zim tries feebely to take over our planet for his species but is foiled in a hilaious off-beat way by his child arch-enemy, Dib. With a slap-stick and obsurd humor that this series produced, it's a shame it only ran three seasons. This box set has all 29 episodes and is well worth the investment if you enjoyed anything that Jhonen Vasquez has done in the past."
5,Animation Fan,"This is the best bargain for the best frenetic animation thrill ride. There is something for everybody. If you don't laugh out loud at least every few seconds for the 715 minute duration then you have less than no sense of humor at all. You will find yourself screaming out memorable quotes, discovering the use of new idiomatic expressions for everything you now do. It is Not Stupid. It's Advanced! I love this show."
1,Still waiting,ZERO customer satisfaction. I ordered this DVD set for my son before Thanksgiving expecting it to be here by Christmas-didn't make it. Hoped it would be here by his birthday in February-didn't get it. Wanted it as a graduation present in June-not here yet. Now it is a matter of wills and open orders on Amazon to see if it will ever get here.
1,"Awful, Just Awful","I ordered the set a while ago, but just recently got to the last two discs and they are all warped. This is very upsetting because my favorite episode was on the second to last disc. They skip so bad I can't watch it. Does any one know if I can get my money back? I have never had a problem like this before!"
1,Arrived damaged,"I ordered a ""new"" DVD set. It was missing Disc 1 and Disc 5 was visibly warped on the edge. I've returned it and ordered a new set. I'll re-review when I get the other one!"
1,Not a blues players DVD,"I play blues guitar, and am always looking for instruction that may give me a better understanding of the art. I had seen some things of Don Mock's on youtube that impressed me. He appeared to be a great communicator, and could take the mystery out of learning. I'm afraid that this DVD did nothing for me, though. After watching it once I put it on the shelf for a year. I gave it another try, and it went back to the shelf where it will probably reside forever. Sorry for not being more specific as to it's faults, but hopefully my impression after giving it a second chance will have some merit. I play the blues, and this didn't do it for me."
2,WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFE TRENT,Wow they a sucker is born everyday. Well Iam a sucker. His info is outdated I dont care what his review says because that is his job so you would buy it. Most of the stuff is just plain. The section that got me upset the most is the section getting a new soc sec #. Sorry you try it like you do in the book and guess what you wont get nothing.
2,UFOs Fascism,"I guess I'll be the first one to go against the grain here, but I think the DVD fails to mention the extraterrestrial forces at work against Earth. Since Earth is a hospitable planet with immense resources, we are under surveillance by aliens whose intent it is to conquer us.That what leads me to believe that the DVD might just be a misinformation campaign.I can't be sure either way since Bush damaged my brain.Need to Know: UFOs, the Military, and IntelligenceUFOs and the National Security State: Chronology of a Coverup, 1941-1973UFO's: 50 Years of Denial"
1,a little knowledge is a dangerous thing...,"While I think it's very good for citizens to know what's going on with their taxes, this drifts into paranoia. If you love freedom then you need to ask yourself: did you support school vouchers, social security reform, tax cuts, medical savings accounts? These issues would create more freedom and less government. In the documentry he says the media is in league with this 'Big Brother' conspiracy, but he sure had a lot of NY Times, and TV news clips supporting his claims. More like propaganda than education. No real solutions, just read Walter E. Williams......."
3,mc hammer is god!,"in this day and age of continous mixes, compilations have become somewhat outdated. yet this comp. from 1998 has stood the test of time. featuring such artists as the Jungle Brothers and the Freestylers you knew when you were flicking through the options at the record store that this one would go home with you. much like the 'rebirth of cool' series has done many times before, it draws you in with the range and diversity of the artists but ultimately disappoints. perhaps it's just the draw-back compilations offer, and that these days we don't just want good tracks. we demand the rare and unheard mixed flawlessly with the classic of all genres topped off with a masterfull touch of technicall genius. i give it three (3) stars for not reaching the heights [the price] warrants!nik"
2,I keep talking to myself!!!,"I loved the features that this phone offered, you could upload photos (not that I ended up doing it) or music to create your own ringtone. However, I would end up on the phone talking to myself at least a few times a week! If you are on the phone longer than 30 minutes the person you WERE talking to can no longer hear you, which sent you searching for the other handset! You could still hear them.So after about 3 months of this problem my friends and family already knew, if I didn't respond to them it wasn't because I wasn't paying attention!The battery began to die sooner and sooner around the 1 year mark as well."
3,"Great features, nice phone, but interference and poor VM","Features are nice, with no extra charges for loading music and photos onto the handsets. Even the phone's shape, which we initially hated, has grown on us tremendously. It can stand upright anywhere, and the speakerphone is excellent.Only complaint is the interference on around 15% of the calls -- don't know why this is happening, but this rarely happened with my 2.4 panasonic.For the base unit, the voice mail box sounds terribly electronic. It's like they updated the handsets but used an old-style voice recorder.Because of the voice mail and the occassional interference, only 2.5 stars..."
3,Great Features - Battery Died after 1 month,"This phone has great features & sound quality, but unfortunately the supplied rechargeable batteries died after only 1 month. (they would be completely flat even though the phone had been on the charger for days). I hope it's the batteries and not the charger. I replaced the batteries and now I'm waiting to see how long they last."
4,men's pull-on boots,"these pull-on boots were lined with imitation sheeps wool(?) and very comfortable. easy to put on and take off. these are about an 8"" high boot."
3,Lasted just over a year,"Ordered these in March 2011 for my 2003 Nissan Murano. Went on easy and worked great....but now in Nov 2012, I went in for vibration when braking and figured they needed resurfacing. Service said they couldn't resurface because the rotors were warped so bad that it would take them out of specs. Going to try Centric and see how they hold up."
3,Bloody good fun,"This is a nifty little horror film that consists of several shorter films framed by a group of British young adults getting together on Halloween night to party and scare each other with DVDs they've brought--sort of a Canterbury Tales of blood, gore and fear. There's a great deal of energy and inventiveness here, but nobody will confuse these shorts with the slick Hollywood variety. On the other hand, the filmmakers have obviously seen a lot of films, and aren't shy about borrowing. If you're a big horror buff, you'll appreciate the references; if not, you may just have the vague feeling you've seen this before. The tales don't exactly have conclusions sometimes, just endings, which was an interesting, non-traditional choice, I think. I recommend this as an example of what you can do on a limited budget with an ensemble group of actors and filmmakers and a ton of effort and imagination."
1,Terrible Writing and Editing,"This work is very hit-or-miss. The subject is fascinating as are many of the stories, but the writing is not very good and the editing is terrible."
2,I was...underwhelmed.,"I love J-horror and I loved Ringu but this set is not worth buying.There are no bonus features, no commentary, no theatrical trailers or making-of featurettes.Its simply a bare-bones set of the four Ringu movies in a snazzy looking case. Lame."
2,"Board Nice, Pieces Not","The pieces look like larger versions of a cheap wooden chess set. The set pictured here on Amazon and on the product package shows a contrast between the light and dark pieces that is much greater than in actuality. And the finish and styling of the pieces shown on the packaging is of much higher quality than what you get. The walnut case is nice, though, (henc eethe two stars) with a good photo of a pine/walnut squared chess board fixed to it."
4,Good choice for the value,"This pack 'n play is great to transport. Quite small, quite light (smaller and lighter then all models I checked when buying it) and most of all extremely easy and fast to assemble. The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is that the mattress is uneven and the baby tends to go to the middle. This is not an issue for occasional use or when my baby was small but my now 1 year old doesn't sleep in this portable crib as well as he sleeps on his actual crib, I know part of it is the change of crib but part of it is that he doesn't seem as comfortable in this portable crib.All Graco pack 'n play mattresses seemed the same. The Chicco pack 'n play is very even, but also a lot heavier, bulkier and expensive. I'd choose this pack 'n play again."
4,Great for a play yard,I bought this item for my grandson.. I use it when I babysit. I would not recommend it if you use it for his primary sleeping place. It needs a much thicker mattress which a purchased. It seems to be sturdy enough. My grandson is two months old so I have not used it for a play yard yet.
5,As We Have Come To Expect From Graco,"This Graco Pack N Play PLayard, in Camo Jane motif, is a safe and high quality play pen for newborn to toddler age.I saw it on a friends baby register and ordered it from amazon.comIt was delivered post haste at a slightly lower price than it is available locally.I have come to rely on amazon's fast, economical, and effecient delivery."
3,Can't wait to use it!,I received this product not that quickly and aside from that I am disappointed with the price because it was cheaper a few days after I bought it.I have not yet used this because my baby is yet to be born.
4,Great pack and play,After reading many reviews for diffrent pack and plays I decided on the Graco Kensly. It's simple and very easy to set up and take down. The price was very affordable and I love the unisex color and plain design. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because there was a smell when I took it out of the package. I Febreezed it down and aired it out for a couple of days and the smell is completely gone. I am very happy with this purchase.
2,RETURNED IT! NOT IMPRESSED!!,BASSINET WAS GREAT. THE STABILITY OF THE PACK IN PLAY WHEN I PUT REMOVED THE BASSINET WAS POOR. THE BOTTOM SWAYED WHEN I SAT MY SON DOWN IN IT. :(
2,Mattress does not lay flat,"I bought this pack n play to use in my bedroom as a bassinet for my newborn daughter. After I set it up, I noticed the mattress would not lay flat with or without a sheet. I went to babies r us and looked at all the Graco's and all of the mattresses had the same issue. I ended up buying a Chicco and I love it. The mattress cover on the Chicco also comes off for easy washing, something Graco does not have. The Chicco is a lot more expensive, but it's a lot more sturdy and the mattress actually lays flat. I was unable to return it because I had it for too long before I opened it, so I will probably leave it at grandma's house as a back-up."
4,I would have given this the best rating but I don't use everything,"that came with it therefore can't comment on the other stuff. I didn't use the bassinet since my son was almost 6 mos. when I got. I also didn't use the little animal things that came with it and can't even tell you what they look like. However; the actual pack and play is easy to set up and breakdown. I take it to the Gym twice a week and also use it upstairs everyday. I can take it down and put it up in less than 2 mintures. It is also very light weight so easy to carry. This part of it, I would give it a 5-star and would recommend it to friends and family."
4,Great product but...,"This is a great product, very light in weight to carry around. But i highly recommend the one with the changing table, more useful for few bucks more."
4,Play space,"The Playard took a little getting 'used to'- the mesh surrounding?- for my grandson, but he now enjoys it. My daughter knows he is safe during his playtime if she needs to step away."
4,Bring every where with me!,This is a great product! We keep it in the car with us just in-case! Our daughter doesn't seen to mind sleeping in it and she is pretty pick about where she sleeps. We camp a lot and this comes in handy. It was easy to set up but tricky to put away at first but we got the hang of it quick. The only down side I've found is that the zipper broke on the bag that you store it in. Kind of a bummer other then that I recommend it to anyone!
5,Use it everyday!,"This playpen is fantastic! I use it every single day as a diaper-changing station and for nap time. My only complaint is that the toys for the toy bar are pretty blah and boring - little brown bear faces. However, I just took them off (they're attached with a velcro strap) and attached some more colorful ones with chimes and rattles and it works just fine. I love that it came with the toy bar and second level - not a true bassinet but the full-size mat that attaches about 3/4 from the bottom of the playpen. I have not yet used it without this mat so I can't attest to how well it works as a true playpen. Overall, I'm quite pleased with this Graco product.As a side note, I would like to mention that using it as a diaper-changing station as I do may cause some back pain (it does for me at times and I am 5'3"") because it's not meant for that and so it's not at the ideal height for use as such. That being said, my husband (who is 6') uses it for the same purpose and has not complained."
1,STINKS!,THIS PLAYARD HAS A STRONG UNPLEASANT ODOR !MOSTLY ON THE MATTRESS. THANKS TO AMAZON FOR FAST RETURN !
4,"Simple, and works fine.","My one year old has been sleeping in this pack n play at grandma & grandpa's since he was 3 weeks old. The bassinet attachment works well for infants and is easy to take out when they start sitting or pulling up. It's a good thing to have around for safety (pulling up on the oven at dinnertime, etc.) and a simple design. I like that I didn't have to pay hundreds of dollars extras for the attachments that no one I know uses (changing station, etc.). Seems pretty sturdy. The only concern I had was the strong chemical smell when we first unpacked it, but we let it air out before using, and it went away pretty quickly. Every new baby item we've bought seems to have that smell though, especially the carseats. Overall it's a good product and we're happy."
2,Very stinky but functional,"I bought this pack n play as a back up bed to keep at grandmother's house. It is easy to use and good quality, however, the mattress has a very strong toxic smell. I didn't want to put my baby down in it because of the strong smell. I'm airing it out right now and I'm going to try to cover it up with a waterproof mattress pad to see if that will mask the smell. Can't be that healthy for baby to inhale all those toxin when sleeping..."
4,Perfect to leave at Grandma's house,"Purchased this Pack N Play to leave at Great Grandma's house. No bells & whistles, no bassinet, no changing table but it does have an upper and lower sleep level. Simple and perfect for limited use and a reasonable price. Wheels are a help in moving it around. Construction felt solid."
4,<3 It!,"Love it. We used this in our room as a ""bassinet"" because we figured, someday, we'd need this when we traveled. It's lightweight, easy to put together, and sturdy. We love it so much we bought one on Amazon and sent it to my parent's house, since we will be visiting often. It's cheaper than bringing this one and checking it in multiple times - that $25 checked bag fee is spendy!"
4,Great travel crib!,"Good quality, easy to set up. Only negative--the net support for the bassinet makes the mattress sink toward the center. Chose to not use the bassinet part of the crib. But the rest is GREAT!"
3,Stranger In Moscow (Part 1 of 3) - Michael Jackson,"UK Maxi Single Track Listing For :'STRANGER IN MOSCOW' (CD1) - MICHAEL JACKSON1) Album Version - 5:432) Basement Boys 12"" Dance Club Mix - 8:183) Hani's Num Club Mix - 10:154) Basement Boys Danger Dub - 5:355) Hani's Num Radio - 3:526) Basement Boys Radio Mix - 4:041996"
2,inane & wordy,"The quotes used in this book are generally good; and that is what this book is: quotes divided into general catagories. However, Mr. Pagels seems to hog every page, and his ""Deep Thoughts"" are really rather bland. He fancies himself a wordsmith, but can't be succinct. The best of the quotes are one-liners, but Mr. Pagels thoughts go on & on.....I can't say I was really pleased with this purchase."
5,Buy this - now!,"Glen Baxter is a true breath of fresh air; his single-frame cartoons are always original and often so funny they can reduce readers to tears. The style is old-school, and wouldn't be out of place in a Boy's Own Annual circa 1930, with cowboys, swashbucklers, vintage private schoolchildren and more all represented. The real humour comes from the captions, which put phrases like ""We don't hold with post-structuralist analysis around here"" in the mouths of cowboys and imbue schoolboys with creepy, sinister motives.This collection is all a fan of cartooning or indeed of humour could ask for. There's really nothing more to be said."
2,Impossible to find ingredients,"I was very disappointed in this book. Every recipe contained at least one ingredient that was difficult to find or has to be special ordered. Many of the ingredients can not be found at your local health food store or pharmacy and this became very frustrating as I made my way through the book and realized I could not make any of the recipes. I do not recommend this book for the creative hobbyist. However if you are serious about toiletry making and are willing to put forth the effort and time to find and pay for unusual essential oils, hydrosols, and other ingredients go ahead and risk buying this book. Otherwise leave it alone."
4,very informative,"This book is very interesting and informative. It's an easy ""how to"" guide for making your own natural, organic, or homeopathic lotions, creams, and other everyday toiletry items. Every woman who cares about her skin and body should purchase this book. I think men will benefit from this book as well. The supplies are pretty basic and if you can follow directions, you should be successful. I'm very satisfied that I bought this book. Now...what can I make next?"
5,Bargain price for quality product,"Refurbished doesn't mean rejected or poor quality. Norelco spectra shavers are excellent shavers. New parts replace all those that caused the malfunction in the first place. So, what you do receive is a shaver that will give you the same quality that one new off the shelf would provide.Getting your own shaver repaired is almost impossible now adays. Sadly, not all parts are available from the manufacturer, so this is the only way to save and yet receive a quality product without buying new."
2,Weddings Valentine Style: Rich Inspiration For Every Woman's Dream Day,Was not impressed by the actual book. The interior of the book did not provide enough information on what it takes to become a good Wedding Planner. It would be a good book for someone who has been in the Wedding industry for some time and the person was just looking for additional pictures to provide inspiration.
5,Good book,"I think I had this book for a year before ever opening it. At first I just couldn't bring myself to sit down with this book. Then one day I picked it up and was like wow,what took me so long! It is a good book if you are really wanting to work with the angels and goddesses."
5,Exciting,"As a child I remember this as one of the more really tense and exciting books out of the whole series. As I reread it I was able to take more in and I found I enjoyed it just as much, and I still think it was one of his more exciting books, If you liked reading about Flame in the first one you will love this next step in the adventures with Steve and Pitch."
3,Basics in real estate sales covered in details.,"This book covers basics in the real estate JOB from start to finish. Very straightforward in his approach, Mike Ferry explains how to do well in real estate and how to be committed to it and be organized and scheduled as if it were a regular 9-5 JOB.Although there are many realtors that do very well in this JOB, (the Mike Ferry approach), this JOB is tiring, requires multitudes of commitment and is very, very, very repetitive and boring.Most top producers do not treat real estate as their JOB, they treat it as their business. Gary Keller in ""The Millionaire Real Estate Agent"" explains how to make it a business, rather than just a JOB."
1,Don't judge a book by its cover!,"These books are a dime a dozen. People like Mike Perry make their money not off of selling real estate, but by writing books on the subject and no real experience or concrete proof their methods work. A catchy title is the bait. Content is a lot of puffing hot air where the sun doesn't shine. Use your money for something more profitable."
2,For New Moms Only,"I had high expectations for this book after reading all the reviews. I feel that it is really for new moms. I was hoping for some creative ideas. This book is really just about common sense. Listen to your child, look at them when they talk, spend time with each child....these are very very basic things that you can get from any parenting book or magazine. While well written, it was not what I was looking for."
1,Most useless bible study workbook I've ever used,This workbook doesn't ask any question beyond an eighth grade comprehension level. The guys and I were looking for meat and found baby food.
4,Good Compliation and Digital Remaster,"The collection is very inclusive and well done. Quality is better than I recall from seeing thoughout the years on TV viewings. Good purchase for a ""Stooges"" fan."
5,Must Read,"Fantastic hidden family humor. So refreshing. And if you like food, this book will keep you hungry to try new recipes! If you are from Michigan the book will mean more to you I am sure since it deals with early Michigan settlers."
3,Assigned course reading,"I ordered this book because it was assigned for my introduction to anthropology course. Having it available as a kindle ebook means that I have one less book to carry around, and it cost less than the paperback version. The book is interesting, but is a bit of a slow read."
4,"Not a Merton, but not bad either","Other reviewers have compared Walters to Henri Nouwen or Thomas Merton. He's very good, but I think these two writers are in a class of their own. The thing about this book that especially reminds me of Merton is its heavy emphasis on negative mysticism/theology. For Walters, God is always unknowable. This, of course, was Merton's position most of the time. But with Walters, the negative theology seems to spill over into pantheism. Merton never went that far."
3,Plastic not leather,"This looks ok but is not leather at all. This is a piece of plastic that only looks like leather. Since it's plastic, it's a bit solid which is good for protection but not what is expected."
5,Second only to Secrets of Power,This is one of my absolute favorite books in SR. A truly original story about a kid going through a very strange and harsh coming of age. From high school brainiac to Troll hitman to a Genuis of a Shadowrunner.
4,A Problem Discovered,"What this book reveals partially, and many female reviewers on here verify, is the false notion in society that equality means no difference between the sexes. God said 'let us make THEM is OUR image'. Men are to provide, protect, and lead. Women are to respond to their husband, raise the children. This doesn't mean men don't do dishes and women don't work--we're talking primary area of responsibility. We've somehow messed this up and that's not called sexist, when in fact it's simply a Biblical truth as to how man and woman was created. Until both sexes get this fact, they'll all be miserable."
2,a little disappointed,"Based on the customer comments, I purchased this performance. Unfortunately, I found it to be disappointing. While reasonably well produced and conducted, the singing when compared with the many other versions available is only adequate and nowhere near world class. All of the performers certainly are competent and attractive but none equal or surpass the many alternative DVDs."
3,a pleasant story,"Henry James' classic is a novel of manners in the tradition of Jane Austen. It is slow moving but pleasant. Claire Bloom has a pleasant voice and narration style; however, she failed to differentiate the voices of the different characters in any way, making it difficult to keep track of who was speaking."
1,unhappy,Purchased this windshieldwith the additional clamp kit for my suzuki S40.the clamps do not fit the handlebars. would not buy unless able to make your own.
4,No f'n swearin'!,"Kick [butt] mix of songs especially if you're not afraid to listen to something a little on the heavy side! Unfortunately, this CD is clean. I was hoping for an Explicit Lyrics version, especially since the WWF has made a compliation CD with f-bombs in the past (see Tough Enough Soundtrack) but swear words on this CD are cleverly covered up. If I could get my hands on an explicit lyrics version, I'd totally give this CD 5/5 stars."
3,WWF (now WWE) Forceable Entry Rocks!!,"This CD includes all the WWF (Now WWE) Superstars' themes from WrestleMania X-8 (18). This is a must have for ANY wrestling fan!! Disterbed, Drowning Pool, Saliva, Kid Rock. Heard any of them? If yes, you'll love this CD because it has all your favorite bands combined into WWE and BAM!! you get a SmckDown! CD!!"
4,Fantasia on a theme of........WWF!,"Although many may want this for the entry music, keep in mind this is mostly WWF Theme's done by some of todays BEST bands. Do they succeed? HELL YES!The version of Triple H's theme is fantastic, having the Undertaker's theme is great, and worth the price of the CD anyway, but there is enough WWF based music on the CD to satisfy ANY fan. Don't think.......just order. Well Done!(BTW....Thanks Mr. Johnston for so many years of great WWF Themes!)"
2,"Too much fluff, bad copy","Sure this is just a poem, but if I wanted it to be the size of a book, I wouldn't have purchased it. I didn't need chapters on trivia about the poem. I didn't need commentary on what the poem was speaking of. And I noticed several copy errors. This was a disappointing product but I give it two starts because I'm just happy to have it at all and I believe it was free."
4,Epic poem...,"This is the story of a man who shot an albatross.Aside from its value as a poem, the storyline follows the punishments that the ""speaker"" must go through after he shot what is to most men at sea a good omen.A grim story, so beware if you don't like that."
2,"lackluster support , reliability poor",Three laptops.5 service depot repairs in the first six months.Three system board replacements.One laptop not fully functional on day one.Buy extra hard drive if you have a fleet; parts shortage delayed a repair to 30 days.What's the point of a lightweight laptop if you need to send a spare with your users 'just in case' another failure occurs?
1,Past Primes,"It is absolutely shameful that reviewers here go on about the performance of Birgit Nilsson. I love many of her recordings. In her prime, she was magnificent. This is a SAD performance. Quite frankly, this is pitiful. This was a cast that was marketed on the fame and abilities of years past. Nilsson's voice is strained and off pitch (some reviewers will acknowledge this was sometimes an issue in her prime as well). The high notes are not there.I challenge any serious critic to present this performance blindly to a listener familiar with the opera, but not necessarily the cast. With the cast being anonymous, I guarantee you this performance will be judged as being substandard.Further, Nilsson was never a great actress. No one here can tell me that a 62 year old woman is ""throwing herself"" into the role.Anyone who claims this is a magnificent performance simply calls his or her credibility into question."
2,"A movie that tried to become scary, but failed","A movie that tried to become scary, but failed. Yep, that's what the Ghost Next Door did. It is a rather odd movie. The thing with Goosebumps movies... They never follow the book. Never. It is about a twisted child named Hannah Fairchild. She see's this black ghastly ( to her. But not to me) image. She dials September 11 ( 911). The phone doesn't work. She stupidly runs outside. A kid says boo. She screams. That's the movie. Sorry, but this movie didn't go excellent in my mind. See Chillogy if you want a goosebumps movie!"
2,Things were missing in the package!,"I am satisfied with the package but I can not completely lack the tuner and strings. I would like to send them, but I'm from Costa Rica and direction di is a company that sent emails to Costa Rica, if you send me the missing will charge me and I will not pay 2 times the same."
4,My first electric guitar,"I got this guitar a few days ago and am impressed by it. The guitar itself plays nicely and is constructed well. Mine has a small crack by the end of the strings but its not that big of a deal. I tuned it when I first got it, the tuner it comes with works fine and it has stayed in tune. For the money it's really a great value and I would recommend it to any aspiring 6 stringers out there."
2,Poor feeding; lots of ink,"It prints fast once the paper feeds, but it rarely feeds correctly the first time. End result is that it doesn't start printing until 10 seconds after I get started. It also flys through the ink. Black cart is good for only 100 pages or so.I was utterly disappointed."
5,NIV Study Bible is Excellent Kindle Bible,"We have been using the NIV Study Bible for Kindle for several months and appreciate the ease of navigation, the highlighting, Bible helps, and ability to make notes. It would be a good choice for anyone who wants a good study Bible."
4,It is good,"The NIV Study Bible is good, but it is taking me time to get with the plan as I had just purchased the tablet, so I have had two programs to learn at the same time. At least with being able to adjust the font size I can now read the bible. Thanks Amazon"
3,Navigation problems,I love my NIV Study Bible paper edition but it only has manual navigation. The electronic edition has links (a lot of them) but it is easy to get tied up and lost. You can suddenly find yourself in another book with no page number or heading to tell you what book and chapter you are in. I am using the original Kindle fire. Maybe a pen/stylus instead of my finger would be a better choice. I do love being able to add notes and highlight. It isn't all doom and gloom. For now I will give it 3 stars.
5,joyful receiver,"This bible is packed with info. It was a gift for someone and she said she can't put it down, even when the electricity went out this past storm, she pulled out the flash light and read. She is new in Christ and this gives her understanding, where her KJV left her confused."
4,Kindle fire version provides user friendly interface,"Positives:This bible was easy to learn to navigate on the Kindle. Very straight forward.Room for improvement: The slowest thing about this App is the number of steps it takes to follow a sermon (hopping from one book to another). It is hard to keep up. Also, provide an icon (or other tool) to skip past App provided notes and explanations usually found at the end of the book. i.e. When trying to read the bible through from cover to cover and you get to the end of a book, you have to scroll past several pages of notes to move on to the next book.Overall: I am very happy and satisfied with this App. Just want to make it even better."
2,Disappointed in the lack of commentary,Bible is OK however the commentary is lacking. This is not apparent from the sample. Also there are a links on virtually ever line which only link indirectly to other parts of the bible making it difficult to follow the flow.
5,NIV Study Bible,"I love this version of the Bible, very easy to understand and the maps are so interesting and colorful. I highly recommend the NIV Study Bible."
3,"Glad to have the NIV on my Kindle, but....","The text of the NIV Bible for my Kindle is great, but I am not able to access all of the study notes. This is most notable in the Book of Psalms. There are also other random passages that I have had trouble accessing the study notes."
3,NIV Study Bible,difficult to follow with study marks. I lose my place often when going to a study site Chapters are not well marked
5,Navigation in Kindle to verse is difficult,In kindle somewhat difficult to navigate-it will take you to the chapter but then the reader must page trough to the verse
5,The Bronx is NOT Burning.,I downloaded the NIV to my kindle. It's easy to read and navigate. It's easy to highlight and read the definitions.
4,Godly Book!,"My sister has a Nook. She has the NIV on hers and I tried it. When I had the opportunity to purchase the Kindle Fire, that was the first thing I added. I work with the Bible as a clergy person and love how fast I can get around for cross references and related scripture. The maps and time lines and the history articles are beautiful.I may not know how to work the dictionary yet but I was disappointed. It may be the Kindle NIV is not tied to a ""Bible"" Dictionary. When I would seek the meaning for the Old Testament word, ""pit"" on my sister's Nook, it came up with, ""a place of futility, misery and degradation"" and related definitions for ""Sheol."" When I went to the dictionary for the same word on the Kindle, I get, ""a hole in the ground,"" and a place to refuel and service race cars. The dictionary misses the Biblical context."
1,Frustrating ...,"This is not a good cube toy. As others have stated, the phone is too closely attached, the buttons play only one song and the bead paths are awkward at best. It also took me a LONG time to figure out how to get the letters out of the inside of the box. If it took me awhile, I can't imagine how long it would've taken my daughter to figure it out. She mostly carries the thing around here and there ... WHEN she actually plays with it. This cube generally sits in the toy box. Please don't waste your money!!"
2,Eh...OK but made son frustrated,"The phone string was too short. This is due to the choking hazard but my son still got angry because the only way you could ""use"" the phone was to hold it in front of him.Most of the sides were difficult to play with because they were too small. The beads on top were hard to manuver because it was such a tight space."
2,What An Odd Little Book,"Candy Darling would be a great topic for a biography, so it's rather a shame that this book is the only one available on her. Darling seems to have been a pre-operative transsexual, rather than a ""drag queen."" Sweet, sad, mixed-up and not terribly bright, she stumbled through life on hopes and her great looks, actually managing to achieve some success as an actress (not just in Warhol films, but other films and Off-Broadway) before she died at 26 of leukemia. Had she lived, she might have been able to afford surgery and become a genuine character actress, but her life is mired in the 1970s and post-adolescent confusion.This is not an autobiography, but Darling's own diaries: scribbled, sad, annoying and endearing. But they are not a ""biography."" Sometime I hope someone will write a book she deserves."
5,"Awesome,",The book come on time..and it look great as on the seller describe...I would recommend to buy all the other book from this seller.. He or she is a good seller.. I give 5 stars... :)
5,I dusted this off and reread it,"I first read this in 2000. I loved it then, and I love it now.What's amazing is how relevant the triumph of good over evil is, and how careful we must be to protect liberty and prevent tyranny.I'm not going to rehash the other reviews, but this is important to familiarize yourself with the what can happen when the state controls so much of your life.I met Nathan Sharansky in Israel. What's amazing is he is a little guy. If he can stand up to the thugs of the state, we too can stand up too."
5,A must read for any mature adult,Natan is a hero to the human race. He is wise beyond his years and his wife really proved what true love is. No wonder our Oresident sticks to his convictions. We should all be like Natan
3,Starts slow but picks up,"I thought the book wasnt bad. It started off really slow but picked up. McNaught does throw out ideas then leaves you hanging wwith no resolution to the ideas(ex:Doug's drunk driving charges, Jessica's scene with Barbara) However I enjoyed the book. I too agree that her historicals have much more depth but for a light contemporary read this one isnt bad."
3,An Average McNaught Read,"In this story featuring Diana Foster,the story was slow topick up its pace.The focus was more on the business dealings thanon the relationship between the Diana and Cole.This story lacksthat special McNaught's touch--emotional intensity.Although thecontents drift a little away from the topic ""Romamce"" , it is stillworth a read.Perhaps this negative view is because I expectedmore from McNaught.It is my hope that her next book will be better."
2,New readers- Do not judge Mcnaught by this book!,"Remember When was an extremely disappointing read. I have been a die hard Mcnaught fan ever since reading Something Wonderful and Perfect. This author is one of the most incredibly talented romance novelists ever but Remember When was not up to standard. The plot was slow moving and the characters annoying. It was impossible to care about the romance because Diana and Cole fell in love without any explanation at all. Similar to other reviewers, I also felt the description of Diana's family and the running of Foster's Home Living got boring to the point of being tedious. I would not give such a harsh review if I had not already experienced the spectacular quality of Mcnaught's earlier writings. I am just waiting for Judith Mcnaught to write another mesmerizing tear-jerker that I know she is capable of. First time readers should definitely check out Something Wonderful, Almost Heaven, and Perfect!!!"
3,"A good story, but don't expect too much.","I have to say I was a little disappointed with this one after reading Until You. Unlike one reviewer, I liked the dining room scene when the Foster's are recounting family memories. It gave depth to the characters. I only wish there were more details about Cole and Diana's deepening relationship. I felt very confused with that scene in the plane. I kept wondering if I had missed something. I also felt that it ended too soon after the trial scene. I had to fill in all the blanks after I finished the book just to satisfy my curiosity. I'm giving Ms. McNaught a few more chances with her other books, but this one is not my favorite."
1,Wow! I didn't think a book this bad could ever be published!,"Is this really the same author of Paradise and a gaggle of great historical romances? Or is an evil, synonymously named doppelganger polluting the bookstores? The characters were pathetically one-dimensional and the relationships were poorly developed and written. Oh, I guess it is the same author since this book's one trait common to McNaught's previous works is the annoying habit of idealizing the lifestyles of the rich and famous. Unfortunately, this book lacks both the characterization and wit to fill the glittering void."
2,Yawn,"Gosh, I was skipping pages this book is so boring. The character are not portrayed consistently throug out the book. Diana Foster was supposedly this very proud, hardworking, socially graceful person yet she gets totally wasted and go get married in Las Vegas...??? Then, Cole was not looking for love but said I love you after a short time, a man who was bored with these ""other"" women, can't be tied down, just became so enchanted with Diana again? Just so far from reality, it's so out there."
5,"Exciting, Hilarious, A must for anyone who has a Sister","This is one of Judiths' best books, I laughed a lot The author makes you really feel as though you are there especially during Corey's adventure with the bear. Cole is the essence of what every woman wants there man to be like. Gallant, strong and sure of themselves, yet completely and uterly in love."
5,Great Gift!,"I purchased this set as a gift since I have already read the books. Great presentation. I really enjoy this author. She is very vivid and her characters come to life. There has been some negativity about her in terms of sexual content, but if you really understand her story, you will know that it has a place in the plot."
4,Fits; filters,"Filter seems fine. Fits well. Of course, don't really know how it does with extremely fine dust."

3,star wars boy,"This compforter is cheap . But the picture is GREAT and that is all my boy cares about. The compforter is cheap fabric and could not keep an ant warm, but I put a denim ralph lauren under it and its fine. Worth the bargain price I got it for. I am totally happy that I purchased this one."
1,Fabric doesn't feel good,"The comforter looks o.k. but doesn't feel good to the touch, somehow like you would develop a rash just from looking at it."
4,A Good Movie,This movie turned out to be one of better movies I have seen this year. I really enjoyed it. It has a good story and the screenplay and acting were very good. I strongly recommend it to those who like this type of action movie with a good storyline.
5,Everyone should read this,Quick and concise review here. Very eye-opening book. Everyone should read this book. I had no idea of the depth and importance of demographics in our time.
4,Hammering away at hypocrisy,"In reaction to the all-too-typical political correctness of modern advocacy, Steyn quotes some basic uncontested statistics, and draws some fairly obvious conclusions. It is his style of presentation, and his relish in clever turns of phrase, that has put him into a Canadian human rights commission's kangaroo court. His opponents seem to hold to the principles of ""free speech for me and thee, but not for thee."" This is, sadly, unsurprising."
5,America Alone: The end of the world as we know it,"Every American should read this book, if it doesn't scare the pants off you, it will certainly open your eyes to the world situation that the press is afraid to report. Do yourself a favor and read this book."
3,Repetative but insightful,"By the time I was half way through the book, I was getting tired of it. The information is insightful and thought-provoking but very repetative. I felt like the book should have been a short story length but someone decided to make it novel length instead.While it is possible to verify most of the information the author cites in the book, it would have been nice if he had included some of his source material for further research.Overall very good information but not the best writing style for me."
5,"Well, He Warned Us","If more people had taken Steyn seriously, we would not be on the track we're on. And we certainly would never have let Barack Obama and his comrades anywhere near the White House. Want more validation of Steyn's work?Obamanutz: A Cult Leader Takes the White House"
5,Nervous Chuckling in a Darkening Dusk,"America Alone is an entertaining treatment of some very worrisome subject matter and an antidote to a political correctness that may ultimately prove fatal. Mark Steyn has a flip, amusing manner, but the issues that he illuminates are as serious as they come."
4,A light-hearted take on serious issues,"Steyn's book is more proof that conservatives just have better senses of humor than liberals. His take on demographic factors in the death of Europe is entertaining, important, and rarely heard in America. That said, birth rates are an effect, not a cause, and Steyn focuses too much on secondary statistics.I'm not sure American conservatives, who are used to thinking about terrorism seriously, will get much more than some chuckles out of this book. The most interesting part of the book to me was his brief comparison of the British Empire's methods in India with America's methods in Iraq, Europe, Japan, etc. A more detailed comparison of America with other empires such as Britain, Rome, etc. would make for more relevant reading."
5,Mark Steyn Gets It!,"This book should be required reading for all Americans because we are basically unaware of what is going on in the world, particularly Europe. The biased media presents Europe as some kind of secular-progressive Utopia and, folks, I've got to tell, you it relly isn't like that at all.Open your mind, pick up this book and read. Your future, and the future of your family, depnds on it."
5,Enlightening,Very interesting and most enlightening. I would recommend it to those who would like to get some insight into the Islamic Ideology and methodology of conquering the world.
5,Truth in Advertising,"Mark Steyn in plain easy-to-understand style lays out his case for why we are not prepared for the coming disaster that is radical Islam. I highly recommend this book for anyone that truly cares about where this planet as a whole is headed, and Europe in particular."
3,Not as good as the hype,"I heard the author interviewed on the Dennis Prager show and thought he was engaging and fascinating so I bought the book. It was certainly eye opening and he does make a convincing case for the threat to Western Civilization from Islam. But I do have to say that I found the book pretty repetitive. I think that once I read the preface I really didn't gain much from reading the rest of the book. I really ended up skimming the last few chapters just in case there would be something new in there, but there was not. So, this is a tough book to review. It is an important concept that still gives me much to think about, but I really can't say that I was happy that I spent the money."
1,Unintentionally funny,"Well, he's a funny writer, but this book is, way beyond the indended funniness, unintentionally funny. Take shopworn conservative dreams and dogmas, spice them up with fahionable (Islam-)hysteria and oversalt it with delusions of grandeur and hyperbolic patriotism - and this is what you get. Excites the taste buds, but leaves a stale aftertaste: does he really mean this seriously? I am afraid, for some part he does."
5,Informative and entertaining,Steyn's refreshing writing style makes this an informative as well as entertaining look at what many consider a serious problem. This book contains information and demographic data that you will probably never see reported by the mainstream media.
5,Sheer Genius.,"Mark Steyn's book brings out the missing point about social engineering- the critical importance of demographics. I won't repeat what has been said before, so I'll cut right to the chase. Buy it. Read it. Buy copies to give away to others. It will change the way you see the world."
5,TOO MANY LAUGHS !!!!,"GREAT LAUGHTER AT ANY TIME.I SAW THIS GENT ON THE COMEDY CHANNEL AND HAD TO HAVE THE DVD TO SHARE WITH FAMILY, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS.Too bad that this fine comedian has left us. Perhaps he is making others laugh in a better place."
4,I'm very happy,This faucet was for my daughter's new house. From 1-10 on price value I would give it an 8. If replacement parts are availableI would give it a 10. We'll see in about 5 yrs.I would buy this product from this retailer again.
5,MUST READ!,"If anyone out there is looking to understand The Kingdom, which is what Jesus taught vs. religion, this book by Myles Monroe is a MUST READ! It's even more relevant now than when first published! All Christ followers who want to excel in their walk with Him - THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU!!! I cannot express the insight given to take us from [religious bondage] into [kingdom freedom] and the understanding that coincides."
4,"A good, solid resource","This book is excellent in terms of content and vocabulary. To get five stars from me, they would need to make the book (including the type) bigger and make navigation and reference a little easier. It's great if you're going to read straight through, but if you're looking for something in particular, it's not so easy to find what you are looking for."
1,Not worth buying,"Get the Belkin mic, which is much better. The microphone on this one is low-level, playback is buzzed-out, awful. And if you use the jack--which is why I bought it, so I could record my phone interviews for my journalism work--it's even worse. I give it one star for the *idea* of having a mic jack in the first place--to my knowledge, this item is the only one to have it."
2,think logically,"it seems there is no point to buying this since it is 32 dollars and the quality of the recording is not that great. although apple says most of the stuff they make is for recording and what not, there are critical flaws usually. for instance, i play drums in a band and when shopping for a new computer, i kept recording in mind. my dad bought a mac mini as a birthday gift and i figured i could bring it in my basement where my band practices (where my drums are located). well the thing is it didnt have a mic port XD. and you have to buy something from griffin to be able to use a mic. what is that. well ive come across the conclusion of just buying a digital voice recorder for 29.99"
3,Compatibility Description Lacking,"I'm sure this is a great product. But if you have a 5th Generation iPod, it will NOT work. If you have an iPod Mini, it will NOT work either.The description for this item is unclear and should really be revised."
3,Incompatible with new Video Ipods!,"Please do not get this product if you have a new video ipod. It is incompatible. The new slim-form ipods do not have the data port on the top of the device, and therefore do not allow use of this product.You will need to go with the belkin product, which is definitely inferior to this one. Doesnt seem like a good idea to remove that data port, but hey, i dont design the products... i just buy and use them. Good luck!"
2,Randomly skips large sections of recorded lectures,"I was using the iTalk to record my classes until I realized that my 50 minute files only have about 30 minutes of actual audio content. Although iTunes reports a file being 50 minutes long, it plays for only 30 minutes with random jumps in the middle leaving out large portions of the lectures.Sigh. All those wasted recordings."
5,Does what it supposes to do.,Realy useful....works ok for me.If the place you are recording it noisy....it can be a problem.
3,For vocal range of hertz only.,"If you get this mic in hopes of recording anything other than the human voice, don't get it. it's frequency recording range is about the same as the human voice which is not very big. I jingled my keys right in front of the mic and it didn't pick up the sound generated from my keys because they were generating a very high frequency. overall, it's great for grabbing some oral notes/thoughts when you don't have time to write them down on paper. I am not sure how well it records the voice at different distances from the mic."
1,A Fantastick Disappointment,"Viewers of films the likes of ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"" and ""A Little Night Music"" will see the trend continue in ""The Fantasticks."" The entire script was reconceived for the screen by the play's original off-Broadway writers, but in this case the script is not at fault. Good performances by stars the calibur of Joel Gray and Bernard Hughes are squelched by director Michael Ritchie. Not only is the intimate charm of the story lost, but the disjointed cutting from locale to locale within single songs left me feeling like Ritchie was severely rushed in slapping this piece together. ""The Fantasticks"" does not bode well for the future of the big screen musical."
3,Francis Ford Coppola hack job,"Unlike some of the reviewers, I actually like Jonathon Morris' interpretation of El Gallo. I do wish we could get a director's cut, with the musical score intact -- cutting the opening ""Try to Remember"" was an unforgivable blunder. The scenes with the cop added something. Joel Grey was good, but I do wish they had found two father actors who could carry a tune."
1,Fantasticks,"I think I might have enjoyed this movie, but the DVD was defective and quit playing halfway through. I can't find a way to contact you and get it replaced."
1,I don't understand why this is so popular,"I have been hearing about this show for many years, about how it is the longest-running off-broadway production ever (just closed last week after 42 years), and the most-staged musical ever, and and the most popular high school production ever, and so on, but I've never managed to actually see it.Now that I have seen it (on DVD), my only response is ""What on earth does anyone see in this?"" The story is lame, the music is bad, the lyrics are boring and frequently make no sense, and the characters are practically nonexistent.I'm very happy for the people who love this show, but after seeing this mess, I really have no desire to suffer through it onstage.I would give this 0 stars if I could."
5,The Abridged Fantasticks,"Upon seeing the DVD of the long awaited release of ""The Fantasticks"", I can honestly say that someone at MGM Home Entertainment had some sense to enrich the DVD with all the foolishly edited scenes and songs that were omitted in the the theatrical release. It was great to see all the excised footage but in the same sense had U/A marketed this film properly and had not had the film foolishly re-edited, it may have done well at the box office. My one regret was that the reprise to ""Try To Remember"" was used in the final product and not the original filming that is included as an extra. After seeing the film and the deleted scene, the film seems sort of empty. I recommend the disc to musical lovers as it offers a lot but, it would have been nice had this film been given the respect it deserved and all excised scenes and songs were placed back where they were originally intended. On one final note, Ritchie's Commentary is quite interesting to listen to after seeing the film..."
1,Terrible,"The charm of the play rests in it's intimacy- a pretty, simple metaphorical tale of innocent lost and love realized. This movie destroys the spirit of the play. Old men sport giant plastic breasts, slapstick tries to take the place of witty dialogue and visuals try for ""updated realism"". In the pivotal role, Jonathon Morris's hair does more acting than the rest of him. This movie has many sins (cutting the role of narrator, switching and deleted songs, cinematography similar to any number of lifetime movies) but by far the worst is being boring."
3,A Small Gem of a Musical - In the Deleted Scenes,"The play on which this movie is based is the simple, complex, bittersweet cycle of young love. The movie tries to capture the charm of the simple stage with cutout moons and drarstring curtain. The scene is shifted to a circle troop performing in the wheat field of middle America. But, while the story is left almost intact and expanded upon, the musical score has been hacked up.Pity, with such talent as Joel Gray as one of the fueding/friend fathers.The best party of this DVD is the deleted scenes where the original music score shines, even the trademark ""Try to Remember."" that was deleted in the theatrical releae. this feature is enough to consider adding this DVD to your American musical collection."
1,Shockingly Bad,"There was a reason why this film played in theaters for about 5 minutes, people stayed away in record numbers!! Goes into the ""What Were They Thinking?"" file. Terribly done, a misguided mess that ruins the score and plot,is totally void of charm. The performances are mediocre , at best. Transposing The Fantastiks to a realistic setting was a huge mistake and robs the audience of it's imagination, which is the key to The Fantastiks success. Should have been filmed on a black soundstage, much in the same way as the stage production. Stay away from this, go see a local community theater production instead, you'll enjoy it far more."
5,Fastastic Story of Adventure,"A 13 year old girl confronting boys can be a problem, especially when the boy has all of the power of Winter in this fantastic story of adventure."
5,We love Terry Pratchett,"We want Terry Pratchett to write the next book in this series right away. We can't wait for more stories about the crazy blue ""fairies"" and all the witches. Ach, Crivens!! Its so 'ard ta wait. Just write a new book right nooo."
3,not happy,i ordered this version because i wanted the illustrations by frances hook --- the copy that was sent did not have her work --- i returned it for a replacement (after a telephone conversation) and the second copy did not have her paintings either --- the writing is good but we are disappointed --- it is NOT as advertised!
3,Solid phone,This phone is OK. Sturdy. Easy to use. One of my issues is that the keys are not illuminated. If it had that feature I would have given 5 stars. But the phone does what they said it would and being Panasonic I expect it to last for a long time.
2,Basic and Cheap,"This is a very cheap feeling, and costing, basic telephone. It does not appear to support a basic older style telephone headset that does work with other telephones without issues. This appears to be the case on multiple KX-TS500B's as no one in our company has been able to get the headsets to work yet with this model, though they all have them working with other desk phones."
2,Good soundtrack but not what I expected.,There are a few songs that are missing in the soundtrack. Thank god they have the parade song on there. But where's the cool song from the trailer. I'm not looking for E.S. Posthumus - Pompeii but I am looking for the other trailer where no one talked in it. It just sounds like the trailer from The Matrix not The Rollercoaster song but the other one the one with no words. If anyone knows please reply. I want that song. This soundtrack is the worst one I bought I been thinking about selling it to someone. The only song I like one there is Chad Kroger - Hero. The other song [is horrible]
2,Disappointed...,"I bought the Spiderman II Cd and absolutely fell in love with it, i love every song on that cd, best cd i ever bought. So i figured i'd like this one too. It pretty much sucks. There's a few good ones, but i end up skipping most of them. Thuroughly disappointed."
3,song question,"i played a trailer clip to the spiderman movie and there is a fantastic song that plays, no words just great bass...go to yahoo.com, put in movies, click on movies for new releases, etc...put in spiderman in the movie search data base and the movie will pop up...on the left hand side, click on movie trailers and clips...it is movie trailer clip 2...it's a fantastic song...please, anybody know?? respond here please....does anybody know where i can get the song??"
2,Jump on the bandwagon,"Performance wise - good, but get out your cookie cutters and let's make a soundtrack blatantly formulaic in substance. Then again, what isn't in today's modern music business? The song ""Hero"" is the flag bearing single although, I still think Seal did a better job the first time. ""Hero"" has so much in common with ""Kiss From A Rose"" from the Batman soundtrack that I couldn't believe my ears...of course, the masses probably won't ever notice, nor care for that matter that they're being tricked! Unless someone tells them.....shhhhhhhhhh......"
3,"Good CD, but a little short","I originally heard this CD @ my university's music library, and at the time i was really impressed. Upon receiving the CD i listened to it quit a few times, and each time i start to get into it, the brevity of the album quickly ruined my groove. But it is definitely a solid purchase and i would recommend it to anyone, the only problem you may have is coping w/ the 26min length of the album."
2,Disappointing!,"The title leads you to believe it's Bay City Rollers, but it's really Les McKeown's remakes of BCR classics. It is just not the same. It's ""okay..."", but not the good old rockin' stuff."
3,"Great stuff, but not when depressed","These tunes are all wonderful, wonderful, wonderfully done, sung, orchestrated, and produced. In my early days of invincibility, I listened without a thought. Hovever, in my later years, lyrics about loveless marriages, hopelessly irresponsible children, and never finding a real person despite years of searching are downright depressing.Good music. Catchy, well-written (except for the collaborative efforts with Carole King, James Taylor, Paul/Linda McCartney).But stock up on the St. Johns Wort before giving it a spin.Jesus knows.Out."
4,Worked great for me,"I have used this smoker a few times and have not had any trouble. Considering what I paid for it and its size, I did not expect it to be perfect, or competing in barbecue contests. It is a small, basic, offset firebox smoker, plain and simple. For my purposes it has worked just fine and I have found that with a little care, the paint on mine is not peeling as the other reviewers have noted."
2,Taekwondo Terminology by Sang H Kim,"I will not recommend this product to anyone, not vlaue for money. The English is hard to understand and I cannot click the words individually to hear the sound. If you are looking to buy a CD and learn the Korean for your Taekwond-do grading, it's a disappointment, because there are no enough terminology to learn and some of the important terminology are not included."
2,Not the very best.,"Acoustic Research AW-871 Wireless Stereo SpeakersIt was easy to install, and the sound is good. I have a problem with a popping sound. Even when the stereo is off. One or both of the speakers will pop on and off, for no apparent reason."
5,Excellent Speakers,"I received these speakers as a gift, and am very happy with them. I was able to set them up easily, and the sound quality is excellent. I am now able to hear my computer's music in other parts of the house. I used the headphone jack on the computer."
2,Not up to the task,"I had purchased the AW-871 with the intention of broadcasting iTunes content to them from my computer. The wireless functionality is fine. I was broadcast a signal to the speakers at a range of 50'. However, the sound quality simply isn't there. They deliver washed out bass and a muddy midrange. I sent them back for a refund. For use with a computer I now believe the best solution is any high quality pair of wired speakers in combination with an AirPort Express Base Station. You'll have your wireless cake and you can enjoy good sound quality as well. Try the Advent AV570. Lots of power and beautiful sound reproduction."
1,Don't waste your time.,"I bought these from amazon, worked right of the box for about a week. Then the left speaker went out on me. When they were on, there was a distinctive hum that was quite annoying. I called their tech support and they sent me a new set after I sent me my old ones. Well, I have had them for about three days and the new left speaker crackled like it was busted. No matter what I tried, it still hae the crackle. I changed it to all three channels, nothing helped. Now that speaker won't turn on.Rated one star because a 0 is not an option."
4,Great Portable Speakers,"I found these speakers from a liquidator at quite a savings. My original intent was to use them on battery power at regular outdoor events that I attend, as I was looking for a system to hook up to my portable CD/Mp3 player. While the speakers run fine on the optional 4 ""C"" type batteries, the transmitter requires electricity. I have had to invest in a power inverter to power the transmitter, but having the wireless speakers is definitely a plus. Much more attractive and ""professional"" looking than simply using a boombox, I think it was a good investment overall. One design flaw, however, is the push button power switch on the speakers, which makes them difficult to transport, thus draining the batteries. Just don't expect the entire system to run on batteries!"
2,Waste Of Money!,"I recently purchased a pair of these speakers and I am VERY disappointed with them. First of all, the range is supposed to be up to 350ft. I had the speakers placed approx. 100 feet from transmitter and every few minutes the sound would crackle, break up, then stop. After several minutes the speakers would turn off. I was told this is what happens when the transmitter loses contact with the speakers. Second of all, the sound quality is VERY poor. I believe a clock radio from 1984 would probably sound better. I plan on returning these speakers immediately for a refund. It is definitely worth the extra effort just to run speakers wires, spend half the money I paid for these, and have better sound. Acoustic Research should be embarrassed for even selling these!"
5,They work great!,The speakers were delivered within the time frame given by the seller and they work great!
3,AW-871 Wireless Stereo Speakers,They have good sound but don't expect interference free signals and don't expect 20 Hz frequency is as good as subwoofer sound quality.
2,Acoustic Research AW-871 Wireless Stereo Speakers,"Units functioned as advertised, but competition by other devices using the same frequency band in the house limited their effectiveness. They were eventually replaced by wired speakers. They should work very well over limited distances in homes with airwaves not saturated by other devices using the same frequency band."
4,Stereo Speakers,"Speakers sounds great. Received producted without the required ""y"" cable. Had to make my own."
4,AR871 Wireless Speaker,"Good sound quality, good reception, easy to move around. Now I can move one or both speakers around the house and put it whereever I happen to be spending time, without wiring. In mono-mode, my wife can take one and I can take the other. Only problem is a minor ground loop problem with the wiring in my house which causes a hum in certain circumstances when it is plugged in (I almost never plug it in, preferring to use the batteries, and plug it in only to recharge them - it has built in recharger). The 8 rechargeable C-cell batteries provide MANY hours of sound. BUT dont forget that the initial expense of rechargeable C batteries is not small (search the web for good prices)."
1,SSSibilant SSSSpeakers,"This system was completely unacceptable for even TV sound. The tranmitter didn't deliver a decent signal even 15'. Every word had distortion, an annoying sibilance. There must be better out there."
3,I returned this item...,"I found the range of this wireless system to be respectable, but I couldn't get the power buttons on the speakers to respond all the time. Also, the left speaker had relatively clear sound, but had 'pops' that were intermittent."
1,Defective Speaker and Poor Quality for the Other One,"First off, I should state that one of the speakers appears to have been completely defective, since it never really worked at all. The one speaker that did work had to constantly be fine tuned to negate hissing, popping and static. I live in a metropolitan condo which may have contributed. The 300 feet range might be achieved if you live in a house with no walls, no electrical fields in the middle of nowhere; of course no electrical fields would probably mean no electric, which means that you'd really be out of luck. I also found that the documentation was poor."
4,Sound,The speakers were purchased to extend our stereo system and they do that. They are good speakers but not always crystal clear.
2,not worth it,"If you are an audiophile or have a good ear for music, then don't buy this. It produces lot of hissing noise and static. It works in the 2 GHz range. So it interferes with other devices especially cordless phones.When you walk around inside the house, the speakers tend to lose connection. So sometimes all of a sudden, I hear sound only from one speaker as the other one seems to have lost its connection.Setup is not very simple and requires patience.In summary: Please buy wired speakers only if you have a good ear for music. The wireless technology on cheap speakers is not upto the mark. Added to that we already listen, mostly to compressed MP3 music that has already sacrificed some quality for the sake of compressing the files. These wireless speakers further deteroriate the music and make is sound dull."
4,"An excellent value, but limited capability","We use these in the Cry Room of the Church to carry the audio feed to them. They have a well balanced tone, automatically shut off (5 min delay) when the transmitter is shut off, automatically lock on to the transmitter after pushing the volume button, and are moderately loud. However, you trade off volume for high frequency range. The higher the input level to the transmitter, the less high frequency tones that get transmitted, and the lower the hiss from the receiver. I have chosen a lower drive to the transmitter, which gives a good high frequency response, but limited volume, and some noticeable hiss in a quiet room. The transmitter goes about 100 feet (through four walls). These units are a good value for the money, convenient and automatic, and I would recommend them"
2,overpriced,"These speakers are o.k., but don't expect high sound quality (I bought these as refurbs, so maybe that is it, but when you turn up the volume, they don't sound good - I'd recommend going to a store and testing units before buying new). Also, probably the biggest failure in my opinion is that they appear to be line of sight - that is, they fade in and out when you walk around the room. This should not be a problem on this low bandwidth (but it is), perhaps the antenna needs a boost."
1,Not a Good Experience,"I wanted some wireless rear speakers for my 5.1 sound system. When I finally received them and read the documentation, I discovered that they are designed to be connected ONLY to a ""Line Out"" connection - NOT TO A SPEAKER OUTPUT. I tried to call their tech support to see what I could do but got someone who couldn't communicate well in English (we never made it past model number) and finally gave up. I tried buying a speaker-to-line out converter but that didn't work either. Basically, they are useless to me."
2,arrived on time,"i am not satisfied, because the pages of the book had a red mark across some on the outside. What is worse: I had to pay to send the book back. I will get a refund for sending it back. but it is not as much as the postage was. It wasn`t my fault i was send a damaged book. I think this is not customer friendly..."
2,Dripping with (cheap) emotion,"In his last album or two (since going ""English""), Marc Anthony has gotten increasingly bland in an apparent attempt to broaden his base of female and dance-music fans. His earlier albums showed a terrific vocal talent backed by strong arrangements. He truly was a rising star. But now that he's ""famous,"" Marc Anthony is laying on thick with over-the-top emoting and hackneyed dance-club beats. The album may sound impressive (from a production standpoint), but in terms of being truly interesting... not a chance."
4,Enjoyable,"Maybe Marc's wonderful voice doesn't sound as convincing on this album as it does on his other Spanish albums. However, I often notice with artists who are usually recording in Spanish that by crossing over to English it's actually the change of the language that causes the loss of the softness in their pronounciation (and makes songs less sensual).Being more of a salsa fan I was, too, surprised that it's much more a mainstream production (especially compared to Libre) but it's still very enjoyable.Despite everything I myself find it to be a good album to experience his vocal abilities."
5,I LOVE THIS CD,"I love this cd! The songs are beautiful and his voice just makes them even better. Even though I prefer his salsa over his english songs but I have to say that the songs on this cd are very heartfelt. My favorites are ""I Need You"" and ""Tragedy"". ""I Wanna be Free"", ""Everything You Do"" and ""Do You Believe In Lonlieness"" makes me wanna cry cause he sings it with such passion. Bien hecho Marc Anthony! Te Adoro!"
5,#1 POP ALBUM,"Marc Anthony's first English album was enjoyable, but ""Mended"" is 1000 times better. He has an excellent voice as well as great music - which is the reason to buy the CD. Starting from the first song, ""Love Won't Get Any Better"" you already get the very chilled out Tropical Pop vibe that will lead to the Romantic Ballads & other Dance hits. ""She Mends Me"" and ""Tragedy"" are hot songs. The other excellent tracks are the YOU songs like ""I've Got You"", ""I Need You"", & ""I Reach For You"" are all incredible!! This has to be one of the greatest underrated Pop CD's of all time."
5,Opened my eyes!,"I have been trying to figure out ""HOW"" to break into the Entertainment Industry for 8 years! This book was given to me as a Christmas gift this year (in my Christmas stocking, BTW- I'm 28 years old)BEST information anyone could ask for who really wants to break into this business! GET IT! READ IT! and READ IT AGAIN!Sharon Hense, SF, California"
4,This Dame is Fun,"Faye Quick is not your typical PI. When her boss leaves for the military during WWII, Faye takes over the New York detective agency where she had been a secretary. The author does a great job of capturing the attitudes and predjudices of the period, and Miss Quick is one smart dame with a big heart. The characters are quirky and fun. Written in the vernacular, it can take some getting used to, but the technique pretty accurately conveys the time period and differentiates classes of people. This is a fun read, meant to be enjoyed."
4,NOT PLAIN JANE,I JUST FINISHED PLAIN JANE. WOW! HOW CAN ONE PERSON THINK OF SO MANY THINGS TO WRITE ABOUT IN ONE BOOK. I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN IT WAS DONE I WANTED MORE. THE GHOSTS WERE A WONDERFUL TOUCH. I DO BELIEVE IN THE AFTERLIFE AND I LOVED THE WAY FERN MICHAELS LET US THINK A GHOST COULD NOT REST UNTLIL THEIR SPIRIT WAS AT PEACE WONDERFUL. THE BOOK MADE ME AWARE OF THE K9 SITUATION SINCE I NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE. IT WOULD BE NICE IF A PORTION OF THE BOOK WENT TO BUYING VESTS FOR THE K9 BOOKS. GREAT WRITING KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK FERN MICHAELS
1,Ditto,"Well folks, I have to agree with most of you. This book was unbelievable. As a mystery, it left you wondering. As a romance it was seriously lacking. As a ghost story, it was benign. No redeemable qualities at all. How can someone's best efforts miss the mark so far?That's about all I have to say."
5,Great Book,I really enjoyed this book. The ghosts made it very interesting. A new way to get someone to deal with an unhappy childhood. I am glad Jane finally learned to deal with her mom and moved on with her life. Everyone deserves to be happy.
4,Plain Jane,As always Ms Michaels has written a good story. I recommend it to anyone who likes an easy way to relax and enjoy some pleasurable hours.purchased from Amazon.
2,Dated Wartime Artifact,"This film won on Oscar for best screenplay in 1945. This is probably more of a reflection of the attitudes expressed in the script than any artistry contained within. I can see where the film would strike a chord with wartime audiences with it's portrait of Nazi agents operating freely within our borders. Today, however, the film is just incredibly dated in it's depiction of an omnipotent FBI and cartoonish Nazis. I would rate this film higher but it moves at such a snails pace that it borders on the sleep-inducing. William Eythe as Dietrich, the American double-agent, has to be one of the most wooden actors ever to star in a major motion picture. He was definitely competing with the coat rack in the magnetism department. If you must see this film see it as a wartime propaganda relic. And remember, you can purchase your war bonds at the theatre."
4,Couldn't put it down and keep it on my desk as a reference,"I am a type A salesperson so my attention span is not that great. This is the first sales book I've read from start to finish. I hate when people tell me what to do so I like the story form style. The ""meat"" of the book is outstanding and I am buying this for my small sales force of 3. I would have given it a 5 star but the end of the book left me a bit frustrated. Overall, I've never liked a so called how-to book as much as this."
3,NOT leather,"It isn't leather although I feel they lead you to think it is. I wrote Zondervan and they told me it is ""soft supple synthetic leather."" I think that translates to plastic in English. Everything else is great."
2,Can't Read!,"It is a beautiful book, but the font is SO SMALL I can't read it. I will exchange for a non-compact version."
4,NIV STUDY BIBLE Compact - the BEst!,It is a very nice bible which is more convenient than the non compact version... Plus the golden outline really gives it a great finish. Don't worry about the font size it is very lisible and for me the best bible ever:)... Enjoy
2,Nice bible but was missing the first 3 chapters of Daniel,"Pages 1303-1318 are missing. (Ezekiel 43 - Daniel 4), otherwise a very nice bible. It's a solid 2"" thick and a nice compact size.I'm returning this one for a replacement, hopefully one with all the pages."
3,Where is Eric Clapton?,"I think as a whole the soundtrack is good, but there are acouple of songs that could have been left off. Dazz and Two Dragons come to mind. Don't Give Up On Us Baby? That one stunk when David Soul sang it!! Where are Bary Mantilow, Aerosmith and,of course, Eric Clapton?"
3,Theme?,"I would imagine ""Sweet Emotion"" and ""Can't Smile Without You"" are not included because licensing rights to the tunes could not be obtained.I could do without the Owen Wilson track as well. Before I order . . . Does anyone know if the theme to the original 70s series made it onto the CD?"
4,Imponderable Science,"This is an entertaining and quirky book for those of you who love to learn and are interested in useful trivia. I wish we had read the small print because you need a magnifying glass to read the tiny book we received. We were disappointed to say the least. This is one book in a series, all of which have been enjoyed by each of the members of our family."
2,A BOOK OF SMALL SUBSTANCE,"There are a number of these books out by this author and I had seen some adds that made them look very interesting. I found a number of problems with this book. There were items that only received a small paragraph that I would have liked to have seen pages, and items with pages that could have been a single paragraph. I also wanted more detail that was there, plus it would have been nice to have seen resources on where the information came from. I gave it a 2 as it was interesting to a very small point."
4,Why Don't Cats Like to Swim purchased through Amazon.com,"The book arrived quickly, Cover is well worn and creased. No markings or writing in book. It's a gift for my husband, I'm sure he will like it."
5,My Son's Favorite CD,If you have young children this is a CD that they love. My three year old literally embraces the speakers when this CD is on. I thought that the attraction would wear thin but four months later he still loves this CD. I'm here now looking for more Ella Jenkins.
5,Feature-rich yet simple to use phone,"The i5857 is a joy to use: loads of features, but insanely intuitive and simple to use. The documentation is probably the best I've seen for any product in the last decade. One of the main reasons I wanted this phone was to record a custom ringer and it took about all of about 10 seconds with the included audio cable. Highly recommended."
4,Host,"A very intriguing story and very frightening, or worrying. So feasable. But I hope it will never become a reality. Wonderful style of writing as always. Please keep writing Peter!!!Hannie Danckaarts"
4,A must read for pregnant mothers!,This comprehensive book covers all areas of breastfeeding. It includes pros and cons of nursing for both mother and baby. Mothers uncertain about whether or not they will nurse will learn the important benefits and get practical advice. Those who are certain they want to nurse can use this book as a guide from pregnancy to weaning. It is a quick read but contains important information on an important decision.
4,it really makes you think,I've been reading this book for my sociology class and it has been an eye opening experience. The authors offer easily understandable arguements that really make the reader think. Although their arguements are often a bit conspiritorial it is a good resource and can lead to some great discussion.
5,Very insightful.,Everything I have read by Watchman Nee has blessed me including this book. I highly recommend it.
4,The consummate cynic,"The hero of hero of our time is the cynic's cynic. He is awfully happy with his attitude. This pre-communist book shows us the norm in thought of the conforming Russian. Conforming and revolting at the same time. The hero has no cause. He has no affiliation with any group of people. He is highly adaptable and uses this to his best, exploiting every situation. I'd never call him lonely. He finds friends cumbersome. Friends would want to know why he does the things he does. His answer ""boredom"" would not be satisfactory."
3,"A well thought out, and well written book.","This book is a continuation of the Bolitho series. It starts after "" Beyond the Reef"". Bolitho is headed back to Cape town. The theme is more thoughtful then some of Kent's earlier works. It lacks some of the mindless action some readers might crave. It does have excellent ship to ship action as well good plot development, and the the usual excellent cast. I liked this book."
1,Have not recevied my items yet!!,I can not rate this item because I have not received it. This is the second time it has been sent and still nothing. After the first time I tried to get it sent to an address in the states because I will be leaving here soon but my email was not read and they shipped the package off again. So don't know if I will ever get my shipment because I will be back in the US soon. This has been a horrible experience that I don't intend on going thru again.
5,The subtitle says it all...,"I have read several books on the prophecies of Nostradamus, and this book tops them all. I am completely amazed at the amount of information available within its covers. If I could rate it higher than 5 stars, I would give it a 10. Most definitely recommended reading."
1,Lose Little Lost Girl,"I think Drew Barrymore is a good actress, but her biography was too whiny and self-centered for my likes. I can appreciate she went through tough times and eventually overcame them, but the style in which this book was written leaves the reader only thinking why in the heck have I made it this far?"
4,Excellent,"I'm preparing to move to Romania, and read this book to give me an idea of the way things were over there a few years ago. I greatly enjoyed this book. It was well written, and thought-provoking. Every now and then the author would lapse into excessive use of ""textbook speech"", but for the most part I appreciated the way she wrote. I also appreciated the way she used various stories to get her information across. For someone with little to no interest in this area, this would not be a good book to start with. However, I found it very readable, and highly recommend it."
3,Old new history,"This book is based on two trips to Eastern and Central Europe undertaken by the author, Eva Hoffman, one year apart in the years immediately following the fall of Communism in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia (before being split into the Czech and Slovak Republics, Romania, and Bulgaria. It compares and contrasts the atmospheres of these countries based on the author's interviews, mostly with writers, journalists, and a few politicians.The book is somewhat interesting but naturally lacks perspective and should not be considered in the realm of history. In writing style and content it does not measure up in any way with her excellent book about the history of Polish Jewry and its relationships with its Polish neighborhoods, entitled Shtetl. The latter book I recommend heartily; this one not at all."
2,It was for a paper I had to write....,"I read Exit into History for a first-year history course. Hoffman describes her journey through some Eastern European countries in excruciating detail, which made it difficult for me to find any major relevant themes. It's basically a travel journal. Hoffman is a good writer - her descriptions use an interesting range of words, and her sentences are pleasantly structured. I would recommend it to people who have a major interest in Poland, or who are like Hoffman herself: immigrants from Eastern Europe to North America. It's not a story type of book, so you have to be interested in the topic beforehand."
5,As advertised,"Microcote really does dries your nails fast. Within 10-15 minutes of apppling it to my nails, they are pretty much smudge-proof. No more hair print/patterns after 2-3 hours of drying before going to bed as with other products. I'm going to recommend this product ot everyone I know."
5,Greatest Topcoat,Miracote is a fantastic topcoat. Used in some salons - it's that good. Very durable and quick drying - great to use between maincures to keep your nail finish shiny and protected. I've been using it for over 5 years. I highly recommend it.
4,Easy on the eyes and easy to use.,"This product is, and performs, exactly as I expected. As a runner, I am more concerned with the outside heat and humidity than I am with my termperature controlled inside environment. The station is perfect for that. It is encased in an attractive frame, and gives the outside temperature in a large readout, while the outside humidity, time and inside temp are displayed below. It was easy to setup, and maintenance consists only of changing the batteries periodically."
4,This is what HP told me in a Email,the printer will not stop functioning when the ink expire. Would of did copy and paste here but amazon stops you from doing that some how.
5,Excellent performance,"I am very satisfied with this cartridge, used in my fax/print machine, and would recommend it to anyone requiring this type of ink cartridge."
3,the CPU for the SIMS game praytell?,"when is was a younger lad i read this book called your god is too small by J.B. Phillips, Lilly picks up for me where JB left off.. ya see, Phillips for as much as he wanted to leave his sunday school behind, still seemded to stay not far from.. Lilly however goes into the lab with that same supposition.. and comes out well.. as only a Berkley sorta theorist guy can, with theories that border from interesting to pushing the academic borders... and that's why i love at least his endeavor.. Simulations is a diddy type languishment of what the popular computer game SIMS might better accomplish, if it was say played and developed by a Berkley Don say.. it does stimulate more inquiry, and at least gets you initiated into what might be happening behind the curtain in our search ofr an adaquate sense of security that is transcendant.. it also nicely touches on where the real impetus behind technology and creature comforts come from...."
2,Comforter okay but buy other sheets to go with it,"I bought this set for my son's 6th birthday. I washed it and made his bed up with it for when he came home from school. I was apalled at the poor quality of the sheets. They are the absolute worst I have ever seen. They come out of the package like sandpaper and came out of the dryer the same way. After that first wash, the edges of the sheets were fraying and unraveling. The thread count is about 50.The comforter is cute and he is thrilled but I can't make him sleep on the sheets. It would be cruel.I would not recommend anything from this company after spending $60 for this set."
2,Lacking In Quality,"We have one HUGE Star Wars fan and I was so excited to find this bed set for him. I am really sorry that they did such a poor job with the sheet set. I agree with the others that stated it is rough materials, it is VERY thin ... you can actually see through it. The positive is it is less expensive. Note you definitely get what you pay for ... or in this case you do NOT get it. Sorry they didn't take more pride in their product. It could have made some little boys VERY happy!!!!"
1,Not Impressed,"The Star Wars Lightsaer Duel Twin Comforter And Sheet Set... I have gotten alot higher quality in a set at Kmart and for much less. I would not recommend this product to anyone. If my son was not soooo in to Star Wars, I would return it, but he assumes it came from Santa so I can't."
1,Don't buy this!,The sheets and comforter are very scratchy and super thin -- you can see through the sheet when you hold it up. Very cheaply made. Would not purchase again.
2,Should've listened,"I requested this set for my son for Christmas, despite the reviews I'd read because I really didn't think anything could possibly be as bad as was described. I was wrong! The sheets are honestly SO thin you can actually see through them when held to the light, actual objects, not just shapes! They are very, very rough and do not appear to be softening. The images are beautiful and the colors very vibrant. We'll see how it holds up to repeated washings (I'm not hopeful!) However, my Star Wars fanatic of a son LOVES this set and it's well worth it to see him jump into his ""Jedi haven"" every night!"
5,Quality bedding,"I love that you carried the item that I was looking long and hard for in the stores, and not being able to find it. You had exactly to correct color and all . The price was great. Thank you very much . I will continue shopping with you in the future."
5,An important collection of experience papers,The authors and contributors have provided an excellent collection of experiences for implementing application frameworks to solve real-world problems. I highly recommend this volume.
4,Seeing Nature,"A well written piece, so self explanatory that any novice easily use it. It is loaded with well drawn pictures and charts, and not only deals with subjects such as cloud recognition and rock collecting but how to capture bugs, trap building instructions are included.It deals with just about every aspect of nature all at a very easy to read level for either the casual stroller to the serious student. So you can gather walk along and enjoy knowing what things are actually learn about a certain plants or animals. This is really fun book I take it along on road trips with my kids and have a blast at the beach collecting pill bugs and burrowing ghost shrimp. Now that I know there names I can tell everyone what they are."
5,Very good for this 58 year old (after broken ankle recovery),"I was in pretty bad shape after two months in a cast. It's amazing how the disuse of my muscles in such a short time caused major problems in my knees. I already had major problems recovery from severely broken, crushed ankle. The module on this video that REALLY WORKED for me is the one on FLEXIBILITY. I also do a bit of the STRENGTH BUILDING with the pilates that I can manage.I don't understand the two 1-star reviews, but I highly recommend this, especially for starting out with a great flexibility routine."
4,Well-documented,"Just when you think you know everything about the ACLU, this book exposes even more. It goes beyond the ACLU's defense of NAMBLA and child pornogrpahers. This book shows how two-faced the ACLU is--supporting a certain freedom here, suppressing that same freedom there. Makes you realize that they are not just about ""ideas"" and ""ideals"" but in fact truly do have a political agenda."
1,Not the best pencil,"I ordered this pencil as I collect mechanical pencils. This pencil is an auto advance one. Which works ok. Although this is not a well made pencil. The eraser does not have a cap. The body looks cheap plastic. the sleeve is made of plastic and not metal. Well, enough said about it. You get what you pay for.If you really want a good auto advance pencil then check out the original ones from Faber-Castell. they made first pencil of this kind."
3,Avon Collectible Fashion Jewelry and Awards,"Any reader inevitably judges a book through his personal tunnel vision. My own tunnel vision is costume jewelry so I was disappointed that information and illustrations on Avon realia occupied so much space to the detriment of the costume jewelry. I bought the book because I needed information on Avon jewelry which appears with increasing frequency at estate and garage sales. Although the photography was excellent as in the authors' Sarah Coventry book, I think that attempting to cover such divergent topics may have been too much of a stretch.Even dilettante collectors such as I want as many pictures to increase their familiarity with collectible name brand jewelry--especially with manufacturers whose products are not promoted in magazines or newspapers or department stores."
4,Good stuff,"I am totally satisfied with the products and the price!I will say the soft case for the PSP is too snug for my comfort, I would have to force mine into it. This doesn't bother me as I bought the Logitech Playgear case to use.Instead, I use the soft case to store all of my accessories, and just toss that into my backpack.=)"
2,qualified pretty good,The first 15 minutes or so of this video is probably the best explanation and descrption of the g-spot I have found because it has animated drawings and description using a real woman on video not just a still picture. Her g spot can be seen so you know exactly what and where it is and what it looks like. Then a woman is shown finding her own g spot. The rest of the dvd is people having sex; about half of them are kind of weird looking. I could have done without all of that. For me it cast a negative pall over the dvd; not to mention deborah sundhal who is a lesbian who used to be at the helm of On Our Backs magazine. She does know about the g spot though. I just wish this had come from a better source.
4,Fluke Alligator Clip,"First off, kudos to Amazon Prime. I ordered these on a Thursday night and saw them on my doorstep Friday morning. You can't get any better than that.These clips are an absolute necessity in the telecom field, freeing up your hands to perform the task at hand much more efficiently.They are expensive for what you get. You are definitely paying for the Fluke name. There are cheaper clips out there. If I have a problem with these, I will try the cheaper ones without any hesitation.Watch out for the inside sleeve popping out. My old ones (also Fluke) did this and I didn't notice it until my next job. I'm hoping these do not share the same fate.3 stars for the product itself plus 1 star for AWESOME shipping = 4 stars"
3,"Good info, Poor Illustrations","The info is good. Im a cosmetology student, so I can actually understand the content. The pictures are not very good. I would like to see color pictures, w/maybe a Manikin demonstration on haircuts, something other than the simple drawings provided."
1,Unclear instructions,"This book is unclear in two ways. #1 it dosn't have very good pictures and #2 it has unclear instructions. I have only checked it out at our local library, so I have not deeply looked into it. But It appeared not well orgonized and hard to understand. Altogether, at first appearence it would not be my choice."
1,OUTDATED,"Great if you want to learn how to cut 80's bi-levels. Literally, almost all of the haircuts are a version of a bi-level and the book calls them that. Awful, don't waste your money."
5,Beyond the call of duty,"To me this book is truly amazing the way it takes the reader into a world -- the Asian underworld here in the U.S. -- that very few people know anything about. Not only that, the author presents his main character, a young Vietnamese-American gangster wannabe, in a way that is insightful and compassionate. This could have been just a true-crime mob book, but it's much more than that. This is a book about the American Dream. As the blurbs say -- MUST READING."
3,Interesting but not captivating,An informative snapshot on a specific gang in NYC. It is not a narrative that is going to hook you through the night...
4,earring tree,"I was looking for a nice-looking earring tree to put on my new bathroom counter and found this. It really looks great and holds many pairs of earrings of any type,"
4,Stylish alternative to displaying your jewelry,I was looking for an earring holder that was aesthetically pleasing as well as functional; this served as both & I am completely satisfied with my purchase. The earring holder was larger than what I thought it would be but I am nonetheless satisfied with my purchase. It's sturdy & does a beautiful job displaying my jewelry; I am more inclined to wear my jewelry when I have such a beautiful display of it.
5,The perfect glass jug,I love this jug. It is the perfect size to keep my fresh goat milk. This jug has a pleasing vintage shape. It fits in the door like a dream leaving more shelf space available for other groceries. It is also a fairly thick glass so it should hold up to every day use.
3,"Good, but not lid","Loved it the jug for juice, until my husband killed the plastic lid!Still have not been able to put the lid back together."
1,Have large hands? Forget it.,"I bought one of these. The problem with the pitcher is in the DESIGN. If you have large hands, like me, you'll find it VERY, VERY difficult to simply grasp the handle!!! I threw mine out and bought a different pitcher, by a different company. Why ANYONE would design and then manufacture a handle like the one employed here is BEYOND ME. (That's a teeny, tiny space between the handle and the pitcher itself.)"
4,Good after figuring out the lid,"ok, edited review here. I got an email telling me how to work the lid, thanks for that. You have to rotate the rubber ring till it fits. I didn't see any directions but maybe I missed them.It's a solid pitcher, could have been a little better handle design. It's good for what it is. But I just expected the lid to work right out of the box. Spinning it didn't work. I had to flip it over and spin the rubber ring."
5,Love it!,"Just got this and started using it. Seems to work great. Good size to fit in fridge door, doesn't take up much room. Seals well for me. Looks good too."
3,Mislabeled item actually 68 oz (2 liter) glass pitcher,"Bormioli Rocco Frigoverre 78 Ounce Glass Pitcher With Frosted LidSold by: Various Sellers on Amazon.comBAD NEWS: This item is mislabeled. Label on pitcher indicating 78 oz volume was pasted over manufacturer's label for 2 liter (68 oz) volume. Manufacturer (Frigoverre) does not make 78 oz (2.3 liter) pitcher.GOOD NEWS: When I purchased the item, the seller's price was the best for the 2 liter glass pitcher. No problem with lid as yet."
2,"The seal is not good on lid, came within promised dates,","This pitcher is handsome and heavy glass but the lid does not seal effectively, while pouring even in the pour position the seal is so loose that the liquid spills out and gets on the floor the clothes of the pouree. I tried on 3 occasion to adjust the seal to pour with the same result.I gave up, I seal while in refrig, (still not a tight seal) but OK fro refrig storage, certainly if it toppled int he refrig there would be liquid all over the place while in the sealed position-and when I pour I take the lid all the way off"
3,"It's Okay, I guess?","Like the idiot I sometimes can be, I ordered 3 of these right off the bat. Purely based on reviews.Are you thinking of getting this to store your raw juice? Meh, keep looking.The rubber seal ring stains. You get juice trapped in the top lid and basically have to take the whole darn thing apart to clean it.Have I had known this, I would have not purchased them. Now I have 3 glass paperweights.Will it keep your tea and water fresh? Yep, but so will the bottle it came in!"
4,Perfect example of RTFM,"Length:: 0:22 MinsUPDATE: I have revised my review and rating for this pitcher. As it turns out, I have made a huge mistake and gave up on the lid construction too quickly. (see comments) In a couple of days I will have the pitcher shipped again from Amazon as I have already returned the original purchase yesterday. I will update again soon.Original post: I think my point is presented extremely well by this video clip. This is by no means an AIRTIGHT lid. Don't waste your time on this pitcher, I would not keep it even for free. The lid was all the way in, I could not push it any deeper. Actually it was just sitting on top of the jar spinning."
5,Great Pitcher,"I just ordered a second one of these pitchers after using one nearly every single day since I bought it about 4 months ago. We use that one for iced tea, and the one I purchased today will be for filtered water.Its size is perfect for fitting in the frig and also for the quantity it holds. It's also dripless, pours well, is well balanced, and I think it's attractive and nicely designed. The lid also seals pretty tightly. I haven't tried turning it upside down to see how airtight it actually is, but I can shake my iced tea around in the pitcher just fine without it spilling at all.One other reviewer finds it too heavy. The glass is fairly thick and it's not at all a lightweight, fragile-feeling pitcher. We don't find it too heavy for our use even when it's full; however, check out its weight in the description if you have any concerns, as we're each different.The fact that I'm buying a second one now is quite an indicator of how much I like this pitcher. :-)"
3,questionable QC,I bought 3 jugs. Two jugs are normal. The 3rd one's handle is bent. The space between its handle and the jug body is much tighter. My fingers can barely slip through the openning to hold the handle. The product should not pass the manufacturer's QC check.
4,well-designed pitched' a few flaws,"pros:1. It is made of glass, and therefore does not scratch and accumulate smells/tastes like plastic pitchers2. It is well designed, with an efficient, sturdy rectangular design that minimizes space usage3. The lid has an ingenious design that mostly works; it took me some time to realize that the lid can be disassembled to clean insidecons:1. the space between handle and glass is a little too narrow; my hands are thin but even I think the space is too narrow2. my first pitcher cracked when I was cleaning it on the inside with a scrub brush; the impact from the brush and hot water must have caused it to crack suddenly on me3. the lid does not seal completely; the spout allow some leakageOverall, however, it seems to be the best glass pitched I can find"
3,Just ok,Picture itself is what I expected--but the lid doesn't seal. It just sits on top. This is the first product purchased from Amazon that was not as described. Disappointed.
3,Not as good as it could be,"This product at first seems like it's a good deal, but honestly it's not nearly as good as theLuminarc Quadro 1-1/2-Quart (57-Ounce) Pitcher.A few problems with the pitcher:1. The handle is way to close to the pitcher itself, making it difficult to grasp properly and move around.2. The design of the pitcher is made in such a way that it is much heavier then a taller pitcher due to it being small and compact.3. The lid frequently won't close properly and there are many times when your beverage will wind up freezing due to this problem.4. Your unable to pour liquid out of this pitcher without some of the liquid spilling out, due to the way it is designed.If your looking for a good pitcher without any of these problems, go ahead and pick up the excellent [[ASIN:B0013ZCQ44 Luminarc Quadro 1-1/2-Quart (57-Ounce) Pitcher] and save yourself the aggravation."
4,Nice pitcher but not really 77-3/4 ounces,"The pitcher is listed as 77-3/4 ounces when, in fact, it is really 2 liters. Since 1 liter = 33.8 oz, it really is only 67-2/3 oz. Other than that, it appears to be a good quality product that closes tightly and pours well. Peculiarly, in the order history, the item is described as 2 liter but that description is not on the product page nor in the product choice box."
3,It isn't pyrex !!!,"Nice size, holds alot - but DO NOT put hot liquids into it !!! It isn't pyrex and it will explode !"
4,Don't put in dishwasher.,"I like my 2-liter jug. I bought it to put milk in as I hate how milk dries on package lid and neck and makes a mess. However, don't put the lid in the dishwasher as I did. I put it on the top rack as the instructions said. The rubber seal came out of the dishwasher brown. It's very ugly and gross looking now. It doesn't seal very well now either. So if you plan on buying one of these, plan on washing the lid by hand."
5,"Hold the Outer Ring, Turn the Inner one...","For those having problems closing the lid, hold the outer ring with the serrated edges, while turning the inner portion to lock it. It really is that easy."
5,I didn't expect to love this jug so much,"After reading the reviews, I decided to take a chance on this jug. I noted the comments that said that extreme changes in temperature have caused their jugs to break and have been careful not to expose a cool jug to extreme heat. So far the jug is holding up well.What do I love about it?1. It's compact size - fits easily inside the door of my refrigerator2. The sealed lid - easy to tighten in the jug; I use it to keep air out of freshly-made juice3. Ease of pouring. I have had no problem pouring with this pitcher as some reviewers have stated. Liquid pours easily for me.I also do not find the handle to be particularly small; however, I do have small hands. I can see a larger person or a man having some problems using the handle to pour but the jug is not so large that you can't simply grasp the body itself.All in all, I am extremely pleased with this product and am definitely thinking of buying another when it is once again available on Amazon."
4,Yelleow Handkerchief,It was a little slow to start but it draws you in and makes you care about the characters. Hurt gave his usual low key preformance and Kristen Stewart was very good as Martine. The final half hour will make you cry. Loved the last 2/3rds of this film. Was worth the time to watch.
5,"What the word, STORY, really means","Mullen seems to take up where Joyce was leaving off in ULYSSES, but there's more to him than that. Mullen display a true sense of story, a complete mastery of words, and a charm of ideas that Homer would have been proud of. FESTIVAL OF FOOLS is what story is all about. I think the festival is held for we who no longer know how to heed."
2,Reckless Film Making,"This film hardly deserves classification as a documentary as it does not really document the excustrial. Instead it seeks to build public sympathy for five young men referred to as boys or children throughout the film. These ""boys"" have been convicted and sentenced for attacking two other ""children"" in their own back yard, stabbing them and killing one. The premise of the film, that the convicted ""boys"" serving life sentences for the homicide have been railroaded through a miscarriage of justice, is never given legs. The film and it's blatant attempt to exonerate the murderers left a bad taste in this viewer's mouth."
1,This book stinks.,"I read this book because of the other good reviews I saw on this site. My god!! It is one of the worst books I've ever read. I suffered through to the very end to see if it would vindicate the earlier chapters. Boy did I make a mistake. Unless you are some sort of 'new age' hippy wannabe, you will hate this book. Don't bother."
5,These kids are GREAT!,"This movie is very realistic,and shows how easily things can escalate into a kid getting hurt , or worse, killed.It's the story of a fat,mentally challenged boy who beats up everyone in school who is smaller and weaker than him.His latest whipping dog has an older brother,who formulates a plot : an outing on a creek , where a simple ""get even"" plan escalates into the boys murder.It has a lot of emotion in it.Before the boy dies, we begin to see some of his good points.Anyway , it all plays out at the creek, and we witness the childrens innocence forever lost in the grim face of a horrible drowning death.It is how they face this fact of death, and the kids performance is awesome. We see great talent for such young actors/actress.My feeling is if you see this movie you will not be dissapointed."
3,DISTURBING AND REAL,"The little seen MEAN CREEK (Paramount) meanders through the same territory as ""River's Edge,"" ""Kids,"" and ""Bully.""Beautifully acted, photographed and directed, this disturbing slice of life drops in on some young kids who plan a birthday river trip to teach a bully a lesson.Naturally, things don't turn out as planned...The movie's not traditionally plotted and what looks like a dramatic climax approaching never happens. Its's the trip and the talk that is the revealing heart of this authentic peek at a secret world.Rory Culkin -- yes, yet another Culkin -- is superb as a put upon kid tormented with a conscience.Ironically, this is an R rated film about young kids that's for adults."
2,"Great Movie, Bad Unbox...","The movie was great more than i expected from an indie film, however, the unbox player and downloader gave me loads of problems and i had to try it on multiple computers before i could get the movie to download."
3,Creeps along...,"Mean Creek might read like an adolescent version of Deliverance, but the two movies are vastly different in style and approach. Although nature plays an important part in both films, the latter is more plodding in its approach. As suggested by the dominant leitmotif, it's all about inevitability of fate and the teenage characters in the film are simply overwhelmed by it.Personally, I didn't find the film all that shocking or moving and perhaps it's meant to be a dark coming of age story. The near total absence of adult characters in the film can be interpreted as being a commentary on the absence of parental presence in teenagers' lives.The cast was uniformly good and some level headed direction and editing makes sure that the film does not lapse into excessive dramatization or sentimentality."
3,Just Average Vanderslice,"I loved the Time Travel will Kill You album so much that I bought this one. It's pretty good, I really like Vanderslice's style, but it's not nearly as good as Time. Just go buy that album instead."
4,Terrific introductory text,"If you're looking for a comprehensive (but not exhaustive) and pedagogical introductory text on system programming, and find yourself intimidated by other books, such as Stevens' Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment, then this would be a wise choice. The explanations are clear and it has lots of simple examples to illustrate the concepts. After you work through this book, you'll be ready for the more serious and exhaustive texts (like Stevens)."
4,Works well but mind the short warranty,"I bought this because it's a good price for a solid toaster, but then noticed that the warranty on the refurbished model has been shortened to only 3 months -- instead of Cuisinart's normal 3 year warranty! Now we're keeping our fingers crossed... So far no problems: It's quick and works well.After more use let me add that if you try to toast only one slice of bread it tends to burn on one side, requiring you to flip it half way through the cycle..."
1,other out-of-print/special order books,"I will not even go into my opinion about a book I have not read, but I do question the availability of the book- awhile back, I searched, and found a diary of a Hawaiian King's tour around the world, published around 1900- it was printed when ordered and sent to me for less than $15..why is a book of such interest unavailable for a reasonable price?On a political note- I would rather base my opinion of Kerry on what he has done and will do as a political leader, not what he did or did not do 36 years ago, but that info has not been easy to find- HE is the one who has decided to run based on his ""Military History"" for 4 months, 36 years ago (although, not to include his feelings about his military activities after his return)... I want to hear more about what he has done lately, and HOW he would do the things he SAYS he wants NOW...Does the song ""Blowing in the Wind"" come to mind?...A liar is a liar, Charlie Brown."
1,why is the image not available of this book ?,"Maybe because John Kerry should be ashamed of the picture on the cover of this book. No one, not even a presidential candidate should mock our United State Marines. A very disturbing picture on this cover. One question of Mr. Kerry. If you win, will you be flying our flag upside down on the White House ?"
1,New Soldier John Kerry,Why would the cost of this book be so high? If memory serves John Kerry's own words stand to haunt him. The truth will come out on this no matter who wins the election.
1,cost of the book,"i love the review? that says i am a fake vet and did not pay $367.00 for the book, i wrote the book firebirds and happen to be a real vet. in the past 60 seconds i checked e-bay and a book is selling in less than four hours for at least$455.00, go check. this phoney will not call me a liar to my face, thats a fact, my name is chester ""chuck"" carlock and had to use chester in the review because that is my credit card name. they want bushs military records I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT CERTAIN NEWS PEOPLE WILL START REQUESTING KERRYS RECORDS AND HE WILL NOT RELEASE THEM, JUST WAIT AND WATCH hint they are full of anti military anti war crap"
3,"Interesting addition to ""Unfit for Duty""","Lots of accounts regarding service in Vietnam. Kerry's testimony before governmental committee gives first hand account of Kerry's real views on the American soldier....as a Vietnam Vet myself, it's shameful. Interestingly, not too available..huummmmm"
5,one girl's story told,"I read the book in one evening...I couldn't put it down. Zubaida's story moved me to tears several times and also moved me to tell others about the book. Its amazing to me that the author, Anthony Flacco, could take on ONE girl's story and make the whole world care! Wow! ""Tiny Dancer"" is truly a triumph."
4,Misleading Jacket,"The jacket of this DVD might lead you to expect a stalker/slasher type of thriller. This movie is far from that, so if that is strictly what you are looking for - this probably won't be the movie for you. This is a human drama involving a fate very diffferent from the singular fate of someone being watched by a maniac peering through keyholes."
3,Practical Application for the Novice Investor.,"I found book to be very interesting, and a fairly sound approach to long-term investing in established companys. One problem, Mr. Lee states that all the historical data necessary to complete the benchmark investing formula may be found in the ""Value Line Investment Survey."" However, I found that the data in Value Line for Bookvalue, Low Price, and High Price must be adjusted for stock splits over the period being analized. Although the book uses the term ""split-adjusted price"" in some examples, it does not emphasize this as part of the benchmark formula. Without these adjustments, the formula is useless in cases involving stock splits. Since the formula is the KEY to determining undervalued companys, more time and explanation should have been spent on it. As for the test, I selected all ten, but there again, no adjustments were necessary to the data provided in the book."
2,"Clever, Hasty, Useful for the Busy","The basic idea in this book is to determine a ""buy price"" by comparing expected ROE and Book Value against 10 year averages and valuations. The model is not all that different from simply taking a 10 year average of year-low P/Es and multiplying that by expected earnings or most recent earnings. See pg. 68 & 69. As for the flimsy prose: it's an obvious rush-job, with cute bios of the Dow companies, multiple spelling mistakes, and errors and obfuscations in the data which even Mr. Lee's admirers at the Fool site were quick to remedy. Basically, this is a first draft of what could, with a little effort, be a first rate book. Mr. Kee has been extremely generous, modest, and balanced in his appearances at the Fool discussions -- I hope he will apply the same dedication to improving the second edition -- for this book deserves a second edition. You might want to wait for it."
2,... a good magazine article ... a not so good book.,This book presented a couple of interesting stock valuation techniques. Discussion of these methods would have made a good feature length magazine article in a $3.95 magazine but fall short of justifying writing a $24.95 book. Most of the book consists of charts and detailed analysis of Dow stocks over a period of two decades to show that the method works. A single page summary would have sufficed. The method proposed offers superior returns but impementing and maintaing the analysis required seemed labor intensive compared to other back-tested methods that are already in the public domain.
2,Don't waste your money.,"Unless you know absolutely nothing about video production, don't waste your money on this book. It's far too basic. There are hardly any illustrations of camera and production techniques. Even though the author provides some praticle ideas about producing music videos and parodies of commercials, he glosses over way too many ideas. Whycouldn't the heprovide some actual samples of work he did students in the area of video production? Teachers need a book like this, but this one needs to be updated and revised."
1,Dribbles like crazy!,"If it didn't cost more to ship it than it's actually worth, I'd send it back and get the regular 1 cup measuring cup. This thing dribbles like crazy. They should try and renovate the spout with the larger capacity cup. It's so small in relation to the enormity of the cup, and I couldn't stop it from dribbling while I was pouring. I loved the 1 cup pyrex. This would be great too if it didn't pour all over the counter."
3,A few useful facts: No Quarter Cup Measurements Anywhere on the Cup. No Measurements of any kind below 1 Cup - Short handle,"JUST a Heads Up:There are No Quarter Cup Measurements anywhere on the cup and No Measurements (of any kind) below 1 Cup. I also found the handle a bit too short and slippery.Since there are NO Measurements provided below One Full Cup you can't use this as a universal measuring cup.Finally, it only has increments of 1/3, 1/2, and 2/3 cups between 1 and 4 cups. I really wish it had 1/4 and 3/4 cup markings too, since they are more often needed.I hope this information helps you in making a purchasing decision."
4,Pyrex,"It seems that Pyrex is just like everything else in the world today, same name but different quality. Seems to be alittle thinner and have some air pockets so quality control is not as strict as in years past. For some reason it is not as resilient as the old one I had."
1,Translator Hates Hinduism,"Wendy Doniger, the ""translator,"" of Manu calls the book ""evil"". Well, you won't confuse her as a cultural or moral relativist. She is quite happy to call attention to 'backwards' India from her Judeo-Christian ivory tower. Only buy this ""translation"" is you would also consider being taught Torah by an anti-semite."
4,very nice and helpful,"... I personally think this book is the right choice for all the cardiovascular anesthesiologists and students who want basic to update knowledge for 3 areas(cardiac, pulmonary&thoracic and vascular anesthesiology) as rapidly as possible within a single book. This book let us see the point among the wide and complicated area, and also let us review our knowledge from perioperative assessment(Chap. 1) to postoperative ventilatory support(Chap. 40). Nicely arranged, easily understandable tables and figures(adapted or maden) will help you to study, lecture and practice."
5,Thriller thriller thriller....,"Thriller and I go way back. I was too young when Thrillermania was going on but I experienced parts of the michael jackson mania since the mid 80's. The video scared me when I was a toddler but I had a Thriller toy anyways and appreciated the video even more when I was older. It is a brilliant masterpiece, the king of all music videos and it will never be forgotten. I love this video, it shows you how this masterpiece was created and there's a lot of cute moments while making the video. I love mike, he's the best."
3,More drama then romance,"This book was not one of JL's best. The characters are likeable, but the book concentrates more on the story line leaving little room for romance. Its about Casey, a seventeen year old girl from Texas that has taken the life of a bounty hunter to prove to her dad that she can do a ""man's"" job and run the family ranch. Damian is from the east and is on his way to capture his father's killer and this is how they meet. He hires Casey to help him and they fall in love along the way. All in All, its not a waste of time and the book was interesting."
3,Not her best but enjoyable reading just the same.,"I have purchased and read every single book she has ever written and I must say that this latest isn't one of her best. But it is always fun to revisit old characters and feel like you are returning to a familiar place and see what ""old friends"" are up to. I hope that now with that she is writting only 1 book per year that she will have the time to really get back into her old style of writting, those books that can be read over and over again like Fires of Winter and maybe expand on her Malory story line. I think a real winner would be if she got together with another of my favs, Jude Deveraux and married a Malory off to a Montgomery, then it would be worth the wait and the price tag!"
1,could not finish it,"Yet another disappointment! I believe this will be the last Lindsey book I ever pick up. I really liked the concept but again, poorly written. The characters are irritatingly one dimensional. They are constantly bickering and without the sexual tension that makes a romance novel tick. I couldn't even finish reading it."
1,It's not worth the time it takes to read,"I would like to say that I've been a fan for years and have always paid to have one of Ms. Lindsey's books as soon as it came out because I knew I could count on a wonderful read. Well, she can't expect me to buy on her name alone anymore. She has been cranking out too many disappointments. Ms. Lindsey should take more time and give us a worthy book to read. (Especially if she wants to keep us paying for hardcovers)."
3,Not one of her best,"I have all of her books, but this one I checked out from the library, and I am glad I did. I didn't like it that Damien was presented as a tender foot. It would have been alot more enjoyable to read if Damien would have been someone that I would have wanted to capture myself."
2,"Boring, rambling plot; knuckle-headed heroine","This novel had a boring, rambling, largely unbelieveable plot that consisted mostly of characters wandering on and off trains and in and out of saloons. The heroine seemed not so much feisty and independent as knuckle-headed; the hero had little depth and his shallow character simply changed to fit the plot's demands. Especially annoying was the fact that, had the two central characters cared enough about each other to actually talk to each other--even once--the numerous contrived misunderstandings would not have occurred. The novel's saving grace is the small subplot involving Chandos and Courteney. Despite the little space they are given in this novel, their relationship is tender and honest, and the author clearly cares for them. All in all, I believe that if this had been the author's first novel, it would have been a tough sell."
5,Where Ten Years After progress to progressive blues rock ...,"Tn Years After was your typical Blues Rock band, except they were bluesier, rockier and better than most other bands around. in previous albums like ten years after, undead, cricklewood green and the classic Sssh they belted out rollicking good blues rock numbers to rock your pants off, what with alvin lee's guitar riffs. here they progressed onto a more progressive rock feel to their album and it rocks!!! adding a whole new sheen to the bands capabilities. and ofcourse the guitarring was as wild and mindblowing as ever. a great collection of prog blues rock numbers. this album is a must have classic."
5,Underrated Talent,Alvin Lee and company shine again.. Terrific classic album.. A must have for anyone who likes Ten Years After. I would say that this one and Cricklewood Green are my two faves... Enjoy
4,Toy for twin 10 month old boy's,"The toy didn't sound a lot like shrek. The voice box does come out in the back so you can wash the toy. My boys watch shrek everyday, so I wanted to get them a shrek talking toy. they seem to like Shrek on tv more."
2,Not what is represented,"This is a fine film about running breaking seas over inlet bars in planing boats. If it were marketed as such, I would give it four stars. It is NOT about heavy weather boat handling. If you think this dvd will help teach you to survive bad weather at sea while cruising offshore, as the title and description suggest, you will be disapointed. If you want to learn to safely cross a breaking bar in small-medium size outboard skiffs and power catamarans, you will enjoy this dvd, in the unlikely event that you order it, given the misleading title."
2,Minor Possibilities,"Most of the music on this CD seems disjointed, however the track ""My Name is Lincoln"" seems to fully convey the theme of the movie climax, and along with track number 10, these pieces of music are quite beautiful. Also track 11, has some possibility too."
5,The Island,"Great composer and happy with entire cd, except for one song with a few bad words. Other than that, 3 years later I found what I was looking for."
4,Old Time Music Review,"All-in-all, this is a very good album. I would have preferred that the Mountain Music and the Delta Blues be separated onto their own disks and more of the sponge diver and sea island chants be included. In that there are three disks, there should have been one disk for each genre."
1,Fun for a short amount of time,"When I got this toy I figured it would be a blast. It was at first. But the doll is a bore. She is completely stiff, if you try to bend her legs or arms they will break. Don't waist your allowance on this toy."
2,why did I get this?,Hi to start I hate this toy! On the commercial it moved so quickly that I had to get it but now I wish I hadn't. It took me forever just to figure out how to load the clothes. And you have to move it so slowly when she comes out of the curtiuns. Very rarely does she come out with all of her clothes on! and Polly is stiff. The magnet came out of one of her pigtails and one of her hair flowers. Well anyway it's a really bad toy so don't get it!! Hope this was helpful Brooke.
4,First half of song review ( Tracks 1-10),"Don't Piss Me Off- The only new song on the album. A nice blend of country and rock.Yankee Rose- The best DLR solo song of all time. Steve Vai's talking guitar and Daves screaming vocals really showed VH Roth's departure was their mistake and he can still rock without them.A Lil' Ain't Enough- A real heavy song for Roth, very cool.Just Like Paradise- A great song that really shows why Dave is such a fun-lovi'n guy. A great chorus to sing along with.Big Train- Fast and heavy. Good, but not one of my favorites, still rocks.Big Trouble- Has a slow pace and tells a story. Very Different I think.It's Showtime- Sounds like Shyboy and Big Train. It's Fast and has cool chorus.Hot Dog and a Shake- I like this song cause the title is just so 50's sounding.Skyscraper- Great technical work with keyboards and the echo effect. Dave's voice really steals this one not to mention Steve Vai's work on the guitar."
2,The parts not mentioned,"The Lord techniques, while somewhat comprehensive in their scope, do not address problem areas such as, corners, edges, lap lines, problems with product drying early, the dangers of tint products near and on carpets just to mention a few.The advertising brochure for Aqua Finishing solutions would lead one to believe that the room painted to resemble a castle was done with Aqua products when in fact it was done with dry wall compound."
2,Disappointed in this shoe,"My expectations were high and I was excited to receive my Spira's as I now walk 2 miles to work. However, I quickly realized that while this shoe may be good for some people, they are not good for my feet. I am a supinator (wear down the outside edges of my shoes) and I have a very high arch. I find the heals of these shoes particulary hard--almost like you can feel the metal spring inside the heal. I ended up inserting an extra gel sole inside each shoe, which has helped. Overall, a big disappointment, especially given the price."
4,nice shoe,"I bought these shoes for my daughter, she is on her feet all day and she really liked them."
3,Funny & entertaining insights into the life of a top trader,"Pit Bull gives a good and entertaining insight into the mind of a Market Wizard. ""Buzzy's"" book makes you sometimes laugh out loud.Particularly interesting; anyone who considers managing other peoples money should read this book. Buzzy shows the dark side of this business and how negatively it can affect the money manager.Don't expect another Remiscence of a Stock Operator, for that Pit Bull lacks depts on the psychology of a trader and focuses mainly on short term trading (the author is basically a scalper).All in all a worth-reading book on the life of a top trader."
5,"A Good Read - Enjoyable, entertaining, and encouraging","As other reviewers have noted, this is not a technical ""how-to"" type of book. However, it gives unique insight into the psychology of someone who has succeeded in a game where in the end, psychology more than anything else divides the winners from the losers, and the losers from their money."
5,The BEST,"This is probably the BEST book I ever read on trading. Mr. Schwartz is a swing (day-)trader and made $20-30-40.000 a day. Beat that! He describes a lot about his trading method (you will find it hard to understand if you are new to trading but with some experience you can realize the very similar elements you were implementing in your trading, at least I did LOL)Anyway, the book is a joy to read and made me laugh hard a couple of times. That wedding story was hilarious!If you want to know what true fanaticism means or what does it take to go beyond $10.000.000 and whether it's worth it, read this book!Thank you Martin for writing this, wish you all the best:G.P."
4,A true inspiration for the independent trader,"Marty Schwartz has always been one of my favorite Wizards from the Jack Schwager series. He has shown that it is possible for a determined individual to work hard and develop their own trading plan and be very successful at it on their own. The guy is super-aggressive and has balls of steel to beat others in this hypercompetitive world.The book does have a bit too much of superflous details about his personal life that have more to do with his ego than his trading success. And regarding his daily routine, does one really need to know about his 'plumbing' schedule? Regardless, this is a must-read not just for the entertainment value, but the brutal ups and downs that any big-shot trader faces."
2,"Lore is always exciting, but...","Schwartz gives a visceral feel for his trading style and his life, and the book was exciting to read, but, if you are looking for deep insight find it elsewhere. Actually his trading style is very simple - Schwartz is a Zweig clone momentum player. He owes much of his success to a few indicators that are bound to fail one day. But his drive is overpowering, and by that time he'll have new weapons. Schwartz is not worth knowing as a person, and he talks narcissistically of himself, even offering us details of his defecation patterns. If you want a good read don't buy Pit Bull. A far superior book is Neiderhoffer's ""The Education of a Speculator""."
5,The Experiment,"It appears that the author who was very liberal, set out to make an unbiased attempt to find if he could be persuaded to become a conservative. He had rules for what he called his experiment. One of the rules was to read and listen only to conservative news sources during this period. A number of conservatives were interviewed including some well known and some not. He also observed a College Republican Convention. It appears that he certainly had a softened attitude toward conservatives and a better understanding of them after the experiment even if he remained a liberal."
1,Ugh.,"People are always condemning the Dalyites for their ""separatism,"" but my feeling is that they couldn't be separate enough. Well, maybe on Neptune. The far side."
5,This book was great!,"I thought this book was one of Ann Rinaldi's better stories. This was a great book that I hardly could put down. I would recommend this book to anyone. I thought that the story as just enough adventure, humor, and wisdom."
3,gone with the wind again!,"This was a fairly entertaining book, but after reading gone with the wind, it was to predictable. Will Mclean is almost exactly like Rhett Butler, and Ocsie is like Scarlet O'Hara. Ocsie's love, Alex, is just like Ashley ,married with lost hope for the South, and all the other characters have something in common with Gone with the wind as well."
4,He tells it like it is,"Irwin Schiff is a master at cutting through the government rhetoric and telling you in plain language what's really going on. He does it in a way that really makes it easy for anyone to understand the absurdity of our governments financial policies. He breaks through the deceptions and lies and gets you to the bare bones truth. If you can handle the truth, this book is for you. If you work for an employer, I don't know that they will actually allow you to stop participating in the Social Security tax that's being withheld from your pay, but it's really nice to be informed as to what's really going on."
5,One of my secret to be able to publish many papers by myself,"Many professors (in Taiwan) are surprised that I can publish many scientific paper by myself starting from my Ph.D days.Of course, my deligence over the years are undeniable.However,there are two other secrets: Firstly, I got the help from a Canadian, John Ogilvie, who is also my senior from one of the university I studied. He helped me to correct my English. He said, he will let my English ""as beautiful as the Queen"".The other secret is that I read this book.It is written by a retired editor after serving most of his life in a scientific journal and saw many papers and noticed their problems.If you want to play this ""adult game"" in the scientific world, you must read this book. During the years, I saw many people, even after they became professors for many years, still don't understand the art. I am lucy to encountered this book at the beginning of my career. I recommended it to everyone who wants to become a scientist."
3,Worked okay for about 8 mos.,"I recently had to replace this phone after approximately 8 mos. because it kept shutting off (one handset) the handset and kept giving a message ""alternate handset in use"". I didn't have an alternate handset; never did have one. Anyway, the phone was okay for the 8 mos. before that; the volume levels were better than most phones and the speakerphone worked well. I've used V-Tech phones for some years now and was always happy with them, but this model was disappointing to me. I also liked the idea of using AA batteries, which was a plus for me at first; however, the battery life (in my opinion anyway), could have been longer. I used rechargeable AA's and would have to swap them out after about 3 1/2 to 4 hrs; that was a pain on a long distance call. I don't think I would ever purchase this model again. I replaced this with a new Panasonic DECT 6.0 and I truly love that phone (see my review on that phone)."
3,"not what I expected, but still good","These were a great price, so I can't complain, but mostly they taste like Doritos. I was expecting that they would taste more like Guacamole which they don't. I wouldn't have purchased a case of 60 bags of Doritos."
3,Just another reprint collection,"This is a pretty good comic book story, but unfortunately, it's not a complete story. It's a collection of the first half of a story. If the original comic series completed the story arc in the first 12 issues, then the TPB should have included all of those issues. Also, too many Amazon reviewers make more of the story than they probably should. This comic is well written and well illustrated, but it is definitely not on the same level as ""Watchmen"" or the Denny O'Neil/Neal Adams ""Green Lantern/Green Arrow"" stories of the early 1970s. It's just another comic book story, and this collection leaves the reader hanging at the end."
5,this book is very good for six graders.,this book is exsalent for people who like indians and nature it tells who in ican boy to find his destiny AND IT TELLS HOW THE PEOPLE LIVE AND IT TELLS MYSTERIES SO THAT IS WHY I RATE A FIVE.
4,A MUST READ!,"The Secret of the Andes is about a boy that has to carry on the traditions of his native people, the Incas, if he wants them to survive. I liked this book a lot because it always left you wanting to read more and find out what was going to happen next. Another reason is that the main character was a boy my age. Anyone who likes to read stories about other cultures would like to read Secret of the Andes."
1,My Review of this book!,"Ok, in grade 6 our teacher made us all read this book, and I have to say, it is the most BORING thing I've read. It's SOOOOOO slow, and hard to follow. It's very poorly written, and hard to understand. I can barely remember what it's about... I'm sorry if you were insulted by this, or like the book."
1,this book is so bad our teacher read it to us ulk i hate it,this book was rrrreeeeeeaaaaaaallllllyyyyy borring and it was so historic the names were hard and they dress weird. Our teacher is at the end and i am happyIstill have to do a book report on it that stinks so if your reading this please dont read it or you'll be sorry
1,Not good,"I am sitting here with my 9 year old son and he was required to read this book for his 4th grade class. He was supposed to do a book report on it. This is what he said about ""Secret of the Andes."" ""I did not like it because it was boring,the topic was not interesting. There was not alot of action."" My son enjoys reading most of the time, and he really did not enjoy this book."
3,Black Cherry is better,"I loved Black Cherry, so I had high expectations for this album. It's very mediocre. Black Cherry is much better."
4,Enjoyable and Fun,"I was pleasantly surprised with this CD. I have never listened to any of her previous albums, but I was impressed with this one. The album is very girly- per my husbands opinion- but it's fun music to groove to. Although I tend to like harder music, this is a nice refreshing change."
1,Music's Great but the CD Won't Play,"Buyer Beware: Amazon doesn't label this as copy protected.Love the music, but the CD won't play in my car player or my PC. The CD also has clicks on my stereo. It's junk. Thanks EMI. Mute is one of my favorite labels, but sticking with EMI as distributor is losing sales from me. This is the last Mute release I buy.You have to look for workarounds to rip it and thereby make a non-clicking, non-skipping copy. Just keep in mind most EMI releases have difficulty playing in many standard players. It may just be the import version - US domestics may not have the same handicap.Buy it on vinyl or buy it in the store so you can verify whether the version you have is crippled.I'd give the vinyl and non-copy-protected releases 4 stars for the music. It isn't Felt Mountain, but who wants their bands to stagnate?"
2,Far too hard to hold on full zoom,Clear enough image but at half to full zoom the field of view is tiny and the binoculars can not be held steady enough to settle the image down enough to actually see it. I have bought similar binoculars in the past and I should have known better. The Galileo binoculars are not at fault -- small image binoculars with large zooms simply can't be held still enough to use.
2,Myst - old version,"I was unable to play the game due to the game not being compatible with Windows 7...it would not load properly. I did not see the version number...also, it shows being in the original box and it came in its plastic only. If I had known this was an older version for Windows XP, and being incompatible with Windows 7, I would not have purchased it."
3,XP play experience,"As this product was listed as ""XP"" PC friendly, I would expect it to work without glitches. In ""Riven"", I kept getting pop up boxes stating ""Writing to a write=protected area failed"". I closed and kept going. Did not affect outcome of game. I didn't play ""Myst"", only ""Exile"" and ""Riven"". Could not adjust screen brightness/contrast per game instructions but overall viewing was good."
3,Read before buying.,"Myst simply does not work. Riven and the third one work ok, but the original myst is unplayable unless you want to screw up itunes to play it. The problem that i have (and also many many others have) is that the game myst needs to run on an outdated quicktime player. so unfortunately if you get the old quicktime player you will be unable to have itunes play correctly if at all. Please please do a little research online to see just how many people are having trouble getting myst to work. google ""how to get myst to work"" and you will see many posts on boards and unfortunately there is no answer on how to get it to work. just people who say ""I give up."" So if you dont really want to play the first myst this shouldnt stop you from buying this product. otherwise you should probably spend money on something else that works."
1,They said it would work on a Mac.....,I don't know how fun this game is or how I rate it because I CAN'T load it on my Mac! It's Mac compatible but the list of instructions to download it onto my machine is so long and complicated (and incomplete) that I can't play it. Very sad!
1,Attention Mac users -- DO NOT BUY THIS!,"So I read other reviews saying they had trouble getting this to work on their Mac, but the dang box says that it's for Mac! I figured that it must be a user error. Not the case. This will not work on your Mac if you have a recent version of the operating system. It's really sad that a game that was made on the Mac and would look beautiful on a Macbook Pro is incompatible. Hey Amazon! Change the description of this product! It's extremely frustrating."
5,"A little nostalgia for my parents, a new experience for me","I was too young to play the original Myst, but my mom had, and one day we were shopping at the mall and we saw this--so voila! At first I was just sort of confused--where the crap am I? What am I supposed to do with the boat? I was totally used to action and platform games that my brothers played, and I was actually afraid that people were going to attack me from behind the doors and stuff. At first I needed the hints, but eventually I ""weaned"" off them, at least until that subway thing at the end. I had a fantastic time playing Myst. It didn't crash but once, either.When I played Riven, though, it crashed a little more, and of course, the whole concept was not so foreign, so it lost a little novelty appeal. The graphics were a lot better, though. I haven't beaten it though (no hints!). I look forward to beating it eventually, though. I have XP and the crashes suck, but it doesn't really spoil any gameplay."
2,Lasted 5 minutes,"I had the same switch in my 5 amp Ryobi hand plainer that went out. After about five minutes of use, it quit working. I tried to pop open the switch to see if I could fix it, but it looked like the plastic that holds the contacts got too warm and melted slightly. This prevented one of the contacts from bridging the connection then the button was pressed. I gave it two stars instead of one only because it was on used in the string trimmer it was advertised for, but it was still a 5 amp application."
4,another winner,Evanovich is a hit-machine. This is classic fall off your chair funny with lots of excitement too.
5,great audio book!,"CJ Critt delivers again....Motormouth is entertaining, campy & fun. Whilst I adore Stephanie Plum, I also love Alex barnaby. She's great! I keep seeing the story as a movie. It would be great if cast & directed right. It's kinda like Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels. A hoot, I totally give it 5 stars. People are way too critical, it's popcorn poppin, great summer listening!"
3,"It's not perfect, but I enjoyed it and laughed a few times","I would have liked the characters to be better defined. I would have liked to have understood the timeline for the events better. How long does it take to drive from NC to South Beach? I would have liked to some of the ""chase"" scenes to have made more sense and had a better follow through.Despite all that, I enjoy these two characters and most of the by-play between them. Beans was cute.It was a fast read, and I chuckled a number of times. You do have to just go with it. It's not a real mystery, it's just a convience for these two to be together and have a bit of adventure.I'm glad I purchased the book, but it wasn't worth the prices I paid, though I did get an autograph from Janet Evanovich."
3,Should be retitled...,"This novel should be retitled ""Potty Mouth"" because of the profanity. Evanovich can be very funny and I love her book on tape reader, C. J. Critt, but a little profanity goes a lonnnnng way. Why not write the novel without the profanity since we hear enough of it in our society now? Escapism is all it's cracked up to be and I would love to see Evanovich write a profanity-free funny book I could escape into. How about it, Janet?"
2,Motor Mouth,"This was a fast read, but a rather outlandish plot line. The more the story progressed the more unrealistic it became. Might be a decent beach book if you are looking for something light."
2,Hard to like Barney,"The main appeal of Stephanie Plum is that she's an average woman, dealing with an average family and some not so average circumstances. Alexandra Barnaby is freaking wonder woman with bad judgment. The secondary characters seem to be two dimensional copies of the Plum characters, but with less interesting personalities.Trying to like these first person POV told stories when you hate the main voice is near impossible. This was the last Barney book I'm going to bother with, I'd rather reread Plum."
1,"Why, why why?","I usually depend on Janet Evanovich for quick, funny and involving mysteries, but I'll never read another Alex Barnaby again. So much is a rehash of what works with Stephanie Plum; coy off-and-on romance, check; sassy ethnic ladies, check; sloppy dogs, check.This one made no sense. Why didn't Alex and Nascar guy call the police right away when a friend disappeared? How could they be in hiding while involving people with huge families in their problems and being asked for autographs?It was also disgusting. Who wants to read about a dog with bowel issues, nasty corpses and a dog with bowel issues having run-ins with nasty corpses? Most disturbingly, none of the gore bothered the main characters. It was like a PG-rated 'Natural Born Killers.'"
2,Weak and disappointing..,I never miss an Evanovich book. She is the only author I actually buy in harcover. I want my money back !!! This is a pale shadow of her usual writing. Maybe her publisher was pressuring her for a book so she tossed this one off. I don't know but I do know I was very disappointed.
5,Awesome!,"LOVE THIS BOOK! LOVE BARNEY AND HOOKER, WHAT A GREAT SERIES! If you listen to the audio, CJ Critt does an AWESOME job with all of the voices. My grandchildren love hearing these books on audio."
2,I can't seem to stay awake with this book....,"I normally love all of Janet Evanovich's books, but this book puts me to sleep, half a page and I am out like a light!"
1,Two different models and different quality,"There are two different versions of this system. One is terrific and one is the worst telephone system I have ever owned. The terrific system is model E5655, purchased from Hammacher Schlemmer, and the dreadful system is model E5965C, which is the model sold here on Amazon.The model sold by Hammacher Schlemmer is about half the size and bulk of the model sold here. As others have written, the model sold here, even a well-charged phone, repeatedly goes dead in the middle of conversations. I own both the system and the accessory phone, and both are dreadful. In the Hammacher Schlmmer version, the phone is perfect."
3,Looks good but....,the sheets have a rough feel... even after several washings and fabric softner. The comforter is fine it washes and dries with no problem... Just wish they would make a softer sheet set.
2,"So much potential, so little fulfillment.","I love Europe. I love reading about Europe. I love stories that take place in Europe with vivid descriptions and lively characters and funny anecdotes. This book promised all this and more. Unfortunately, it didn't deliver. Instead, it is a stilted recounting of somebody's road trip. It could take place anywhere in the world or nowhere at all. The descriptions of towns and countrysides are two dimensional and boring, characters are stiff and shallow, and supposedly funny anecdotes are stilted and forced. The whole thing comes off like reading a really dry travel book. So, if you want vivid, colorful descriptions of lovely French towns and hilarious tales of travel gone awry, try a Rick Steves' travel book. If you want a passionate romantic tale, try any number of romance writers. But whatever you do, don't waste your money on this one. Thank goodness I checked my copy out at the library."
1,The Last Time Adler Saw Paris,"Adler has such marvelous talent, but I found this book a travelogue with sex and no development of plot. I have read her earlier books and wonder how she has drifted so far off course. This is a work beneath her abilities and I'll be wary of even picking up her next attempt."
3,a fairy tale,I got the book at the library. wanted to read about France as I am from there. The whole story is a bit overdone. Too bad middle aged women can't accept growing older gracefully. How could a young contractor (not rich) afford all the expenses in France. It is really expensive there all around. The author described Provence to a point but I was really disappointed that there was no mention of the reigning sound of the cigales (cicada) in the summer. It is typical there and a traditional part of Provence and its culture. Vendors sell those cicada in colorful ceramic to tourists.
2,?????,"Supposed to be an exact replacement - it fit my under sink filter unit, but unlike the filter elements I had used before, it reduced the water flow by about 2/3s."
1,Do not waste your time or money like I did,"Do not be tempted to buy this item. It has no value relative to information you can glean from many other sources . It contains the opinions of only 4 individuals (whom, except for one, that you have never heard of) and is peppered with brief snippets of poor quality video of FZ...mainly from SNL appearances. Extremely disappointing to any fan. Laughably bad. So bad as to elicit my first online review. FZ fan since 81."
1,Don't waste your money!,"What a dissapointing piece of crap! Two British roadies narrate parts that are so insignificant you want to scream. Old SNL clips, not even full songs, litter this piece of trash. Do Not Buy This! If you need a Frank fix, pick up Zappa Plays Zappa, close your eyes and hear Frank's music come alive."
1,Does not live up to Hvac claim,I bought this torch from a Hvac store as a backup torch. It says application for hvac and plumbing right on the package. I Used this torch to braze copper tubing on an ac unit. The torch does not produce enough heat to melt 15% silver brazing rod on 3/4 inch soft copper tubing which is commonly used in Hvac. I used propane and Mapp gas with no luck with either. I should have known it was useless. I mean it's made out of plastic. Don't waste your money.
3,"Works well, but you have to put in a lot of upkeep.","The Iskin does a good job of protecting your keys and keyboard from dust, spills, and debris, and it is a perfect fit for the keys. it even helps smooth out the play and feel of the keys. All of this is perfect. However, the silicon key cover does what it is intended to do-- trapping oils and dirt on the cover, which means you will have to wash the keyboard cover regularly. If you do not, all the dirt and skin oil will be transferred from the iskin to the inside lid and screen of your laptop-- a mixed result which requires a great deal of upkeep."
5,story telling at its best,"This is a fabulous story by one of my favorite chilrens authors. This author has mastered the art of story telling. This book made a deep impression on me as a child and I have enjoyed reading it to my young son. He has begged to read it again, so this is our second time through. The story is deeply moving with thought provoking themes about superstition and how it can lead to cruel or foolish actions. I am picky about the literature that I read to my child, but this book is about as good as it gets."
5,Not bad at all.,"This is a good collection of Kim Carnes's songs. ""Bette Davis Eyes"" is on here of course, but my favorite is ""More Love"". This does have most of her biggest hits like ""Crazy In The Night(Barking At Airplanes)"" and ""Voyeur"". If you are looking for a little collection of her songs, then get this because it is to the point, short and sweet."
4,Fun Movie!,"I felt this movie explored several social/political points in it's story-line and was a good cautionary tale of some of the real life politics occurring today in society with corporations and the government. I found it to be fun and engaging, some good plot twists... definitely worth watching."
5,Great Book,I gave this as a gift and it was a great hit. He had been looking for this book for years. This book gives you all sorts of details about desiel engines that aren't found elsewhere. It is a great companion the the Steam Locomotive Cyclopedia for train buffs.
3,Not what I expected....,"Not what I expected. If this game was more along the lines of Cafe World it would probably be a best seller and most played game. It starts out ok but you can quickly loose interest in the game. It's good for teaching you how to keep a business going, but other than that you are wondering how to get ahead in the game. No tips no help makes this a dull game."
4,Restaurant Empire,"Ok, First of all When I bought this game I thought I was going to cook and Everything....But all you can do it pan the menu and resturaunt whichs takes about 30 minutes.So everytime you want to play its just the same thing. There is probully a lot more to it but I don't know how to do."
3,Empire,"The game is okay i guess, you can use your sims1 skins to update it. All in all, i realised that it was a little short on what i expected."
5,BATTERY FOR SONY CYBERSHOT CAMERA,Works great! Still using it. I keep it plugged in. I bought 2 batteries and one is always being charged while the other is being used. I do give it a break once in a while. Ha. Great price. Love it!
4,Let It All Out!!,"Rainbow High is a very inspirational book. Especially for the Lesbians, Bisexuals, Gays and Queers. An inspiration because alot of homosexuals are very uncomfortable with the way they look and how they would fit in with the world, and why won't the world except them for who they are. Sanchez shows all of the difficulties and hardships homosexuals endure in the ""normal"" community, including high school. He also expresses how other people react to their homosexuality, including there very own relatives.I love this book because it inspires me personally.Alot of people dont except me for being bisexual and its hard. But as long as i stand up for myself and not let anyone control what I want to do and be in life, i'll have alot of respect after words."
2,Could have been so much better,"after coming to terms with my own sexual orientation, i read this book. what a mistake. the writing is simple and stupid. the characters are gay stereotypes (the flamboyant femme-fatale, the shy flirt, and the not-so-straight jock.) and they are extremely two dimensional. the plot went nowhere. this book had so much potential but fell flat on it's face."
5,Moraes Moreira is the Brazilian to watch out for!,"The CD Acustico is a must have, at least for persons who love Brazilian music. Moraes Moreira is well-known in the Samba Carneval Scenes, but the Acustico CD is not your usual Samba number, this CD displays musical versatility. Lots of Eletrico- Guitar and Ijexa rhythm of afoxe groups. Moreira was formerly of Os Novos Baianos and his kind of music is frevo, choro and samba with some jazz-fusion-like arrangements. I own this CD now since 10 weeks and there hardly isn't a day I do not listen to it. 'Acustico' is acoustically phantastic!"
1,Destroyed in a matter of minutes!,"I bought this for my sister's black lab for Christmas. The dog loved it, but there were pieces of latex rubber all over our living room before we even opened all the presents. Do not buy this for any dogs with teeth!!! I read the other reviews when I ordered it, but when it arrived it looked very flimsy and it turned out to be. It was in the trash by the end of the evening. Not a good use of $8."
5,A wonderful read!!,"This is the first book by Liz Curtis Higgs that I've read but after this - wow! The story surprised me, to say the least. I quickly became attached to the characters and it was the first time in a very long time that even when I read the last line, I didn't want to put the book down. I went back through and re-read some of my favorite parts. Really an excellent read and I can't wait to read the ""Bad Girls of The Bible"" collection :-)"
5,Great Title,"I was hooked and hyped by this book. I am like so many others trying to find my way to a higher source of consciousness. I found this book funny, inspriational, and so true to life. Carol and Michelle write the stories as if you are there feeling the pain, the laughter, and the emotions with them through their trials and tribulations of growing up and becoming responsible for your own happiness and destiny. Just when I wasn't sure what to do other than agree with them and say ""YES"" I too want to change they show you how with simple steps and realistic goals that each of us can take and use to grow as a person. Their stories are gut wrenching and yet they found the courage to rise up and move on. I hope some day to meet them and express how my life has changed for the better and how I call them my friends."
2,Disappointing,"I've enjoyed many of Enoch's other books, so I was surprised at how much I disliked this one. The heroine (Angel) is secretly engaged to the hero's cousin (Simon). For some ridiculous reason, Angel's parents insist on not only a very long engagement but also on keeping the engagement itself a secret. And so Simon comes up with a very silly plan to push Angel's parents into speeding things up by having his ""rakehell"" (in quotes because there's nothing here to indicate that's true) cousin (James/Jamie/Devil) flirt with/pursue Angel. So, there's the really really contrived premise. It's all pretty transparent and there really is no conflict at the end. Angel has some TSTL moments that almost had me put the book down for good. And the Devil nickname is just ridiculous.I suppose for its time it was okay. I'm about a decade too late to really enjoy it."
4,Razor Eyes,by Richard HoughThe book razor eyes is a very good story about an RAF flier who had a keen sense of vision. His name is Mick Boyde. He grew up in a small suburb of London right next to an airfield. One day he saw a flight Hurricane fighters coming into the field by his house and he knew that he wanted to fly in combat. He only had one problem. He was deathly afraid of death and pain. When WWII reaches England he joins the RAF and becomes a pilot. Because of his keen eyesight he is sent on a secret mission into the heart of Nazi occupied France to identify and photograph a new jet aircraft that has the potential to turn the tides of the air war over France and all of Europe. I would recommend this book to anybody who is into WWII or flying. Enjoy!
1,What a disappointment!,"I should have known -- the fact that Rosemunde Pilcher's name is always used in conjunction with her son's book is a definite clue that the publisher wasn't sure he could hold his own. I suspect if his name had been Bilcher instead of Pilcher, the book wouldn't have been published or certainly not sold as well.This story is so predictable. A situation presents itself and in the next few paragraphs, there's the solution! And he definitely didn't get American speech.Reading this book reminded me of watching the videa of ""Coming Home."" In the book, Rosemunde Pilcher weaves a wonderful story with many varied characters. When I saw the video, the story seems shallow and insipid because so many characters were left out and so much of the story line changed. ""An Ocean Apart"" is shallow and insipid, too. In my opinion, Robin should have stuck to his day job!"
3,Not his best work by far,"I can understand why Louis denied writing these books his entire life. They are not anywhere near the quality of this later works. There are times when you can see the brilliance that was to come later in his writing, but for the most part this book doesn't add up. I am a huge Louis L'amour fan and these books should probably have rested in obscurity like Louis wanted.If you want a truer representation of the kind of greatness that Louis was capable try one of these: The First Fast Draw, Reilly's Luck, Utah Blaine, The Sackett Brand, Comstock Lode, or any number of his later works."
5,The best sound,Very powerful in sound and enjoyed playing it over and over and over. Easily adjusted and carry around. highly recommended.
2,Great but not for a gift,"It would be good if it's for my own children, but it suppose to be a gift. When it arrived, it was just wrapped in a clear plastic. With not original boxing or at least label. It looked cheap and make it seem like it's used and they just repackage it. I went out and buy a separate gift box for it, but I'm still hesitant to give it as a gift. It doesn't even have instructions, care, recommended age, nothing!"
3,its ok,"Another christmas present, this is very small, looks much bigger in the picture, a little bummed out about the size."
3,an interesting account,"from my perspective this is just amazing, really a wonderful account about the gayness of american and the fate of the breeders. A very isnightful uunbiasedd account of ther Gay inroad in media and money that are remaking ameria. I recommend this heavily."
4,Helpful recap of book.,"Study guide was a wonderful, organized review of the book's material. When used with the book, it will help prepare for a promotional test immensely. Keep in mind however, that the study guide alone is not a substitute for all of the material in the book. I would not advise using it as a shortcut alone. A co-worker of mine taking the same test did so, thinking he could get away without reading all of the book's material we were responsible for. He failed the test miserably."
1,Just Awful,"This whole series was just awful, unreadable dreck. It was just ""Glissa meets someone, gets in a fight, runs away, meets someone, gets in a fight, runs away, ect...."" I know that you pretty much expect poor writing from the novelization of a game, but really, this was just awful."
3,"Average plot, good vocabulary, listless editing","I tutor a student who reads Magic books and she loaned me this one. I agree that it's formulaic but kind of exciting. The thing I liked best was that it exposes her to a lot of vocabulary, but the thing I liked least was the editing. Glissa, the elf, loses her sword repeatedly but she suddenly whips it out in the next scene where she needs it. And I loved reading about ""aerophuis"" who were chasing her in one chapter but who turned into ""aerophins"" in the next one. Was this written by hand?"
4,Does what you'd expect...,"...but it's kind of smelly, leaves that rubbery stench on your hands (which is difficult to wash off). But maybe they're all like that."
1,One week of daily usage,"I thought this would be a good band to help with my knee problems and was only doing three sets of 10 bend and stretch knees. After a week it broke. I made sure that it was well kept, no contact with oils because I know that can be bad for rubber and latex products. So I can only say this product was not worth the money and my next band will be a heavier one from another company."
2,Destiny's Child's first DVD collection,"First, let me gripe: the packaging on this collection boasts that all the singles on this video collection are Number One hits. Not true. ""No, No, No"" was a No. 3 hit, and ""Bug-a-Boo"" barely checked into the Top 40. Despite this falsehood, ""Platinum's on the Wall"" is a good but not great DVD collection; the best of the bunch, hands down, is the hot video to ""Say My Name."" Otherwise, there are no extras on this DVD: no lyrics, no discography, no interview footage, nada. Diehards who just want the hits should purchase this, but everyone else should really avoid."
2,Silly and not so much for boys (fairies at a tea party!),"I gave it 2 stars because my son likes it. But I bought it for all the things it says they teach toddlers. It is expensive so I expected more along the lines of what they advertised. Instead it spends more time on silly things like making faces (with a very annoying song!), and a dream a little girl has about fairies at a tea party. Only after those silly things do you get to see the little ones sweeping and putting on gloves etc.The songs are incredibly amateurish and annoying. I think the songs even insult the intelligence of 2 year olds. And that fairy at a tea party thing is even too girly for me!"
3,Great testing software - other parts could be better,"The testing software in this package is great - I used it extensively after studying for my A+ exams to help me realize where I needed more work. The test engine generates a variety of adaptive or regular tests and includes information about the difficulty of the questions and the areas you missed when you get your score. It also allows you to review each wrong answer and it provides a paragraph or so on why th answer was wrong or right.The rest of the software was basically an online version of the Exam Cram book. I thought the book was fine, but I used Meyers' All-in-One A+ certification Exam Guide instead. I thought the material was much better, the illustrations were mor helpful, and it better covered the material for the two exams. I don't think an exam cram book can effectively cover all the material for both exams - maybe one, but not both."
3,Works as advertized - goes on like paste,Has consistency of Elmer's glue. Doesn't absorb well for SPF 30 - more pasty like a higher SPF product. Relatively sweatproof though.
3,A Protected Face,"I have sensitive skin and I'm not sure if I had a reaction to this suncream, but my face did irritate closer to the eyes. I solely used this on my face in very small amounts and was surprised by how unaffected I was by the suns rays. If you have sensitive skin, I would still recommend this dermatology recommended cream."
5,geeky cool,"...and very useful! Great for hooking up your laptop when you're on the road, and zips up with not tangles or knots. Also great for techs to carry in their pockets - you never know when someone is going to need a CAT5 (Ethernet) cable for a presentation... and you will save the day!"
1,Totally and utterly bad production,Totally and utterly crap. David Daniels once again makes a fool of himself by taking part in this kind of performance. He is a great countertenor but he should know better that Haendel must be performed in period costumes and reflect the period.DO NOT BUY THIS RUBBISH
5,Remarkable staging of Handelian masterpiece,"A truly remarkable, inventive, imaginative staging is given one of Handel's most beautiful early operas. Singers throughout are excellent, sound is fabulous. I was transfixed throughout."
2,"Handel - Rinaldo / Bicket, Daniels, York, Prinzregententheater Munich","Handel - Rinaldo / Bicket, Daniels, York, Prinzregententheater Munich is a production of Rinaldo that is a mixed bag. The setting is absurd and truly an eye sore. A true travesty. The pace of the music is also a bit too fast. Harry Bicket seems bent on speeding through the music. The vocals are quite amazing. This is the saving grace. However, the stage production is so absurd that it takes away from the pleasure of enjoying this fine opera. An opera that can be enjoyed without the visuals. Then again, if this is the case then I can just listen to a CD recording. Not recommended. 2/5."
3,Good seller..........product so-so,"Very good price and delivery.I have several of these phones which are not the greatest, however there isn't much choice in 2 line phones."
2,Cousin of Bob Fratta,"Considering that I am the cousin to the accused, I know the man and his family well. I think the author of this book wrote this story very one sided and made my aunt and cousin out to look awful, when they are wonderful people. I am not saying that he is innocent, I am only saying they could have done alittle more on what a great family he came from. For example, our grandfather was on the NYPD and died in the line of duty. I am seriously think of doing a book on the story myself to show more about how Bob's family truly was and his life prior to all of this."
2,Little People Skip,"I love Les Mis and I love this concert but I am extremely disappointed with this DVD. They cut out a verse from Little People that was in the original concert!Instead ofLiar!Good evening, dear inspectorLovely evening, my dear.I know this man, my friendsHis name is Inspector JavertSo don't believe a word he says'Cause none of it's truewe getLiar!So don't believe a word he says'Cause none of it's trueWhich makes no sense. And makes me very sad. I waited so long to get this on DVD and Gavroche is one of my favorite characters so to have some of his part cut really sucks. :< I don't know if this was intentional or not but GRRRRR."
3,Highway robbery,"If you really want the 2008 version, go to BBC America - they are selling the 2-DVD set for $32 bucks."
4,review Les Miserables,"I enjoyed this DVD very much and I am very happy to have it in my library of favorite shows, however I was very dissapointed that the ""parade"" of past Jean ValJeans was cut short. I was looking foward to that and felt that it was one of highlights that was missing.AnnMinnesota"
5,This production moves me in every way!,"I have the VHS tape edition of this and have watched it countless times. It moves me every time, in every way. I've seen the Broadway road show, too, and I can find any disappointments in this concert. I LOVE IT! Betty."
5,Les Miserables,"I love collector's editions when i buy movie, etc. It's informing to see how productions are put together. Ideas flurish, too."
4,Awesome,"Les Miserables: The 10th Anniversary Dream Cast in Concert at London's Royal Albert Hall is an outstanding piece of work, the DVD was awesome, a real collectors edition."
5,Les Miserables: The 10th Anniversary Dream Cast,If you have seen Les Mis live on stage or the really weak movie version you must see this. All other versions pale in comparison. Be particularly sure to watch it to the very end after the producers come together and talk about the show. When they finish the lead singers from all over the world come in and sing together in their respective languages. It is incredably moving.
3,Les Mis,Audio was not state of the art. When played on our home theatre the sound only played from the center speaker. we thoroughly enjoyed the video presentation on the big screen.
5,Excellent,Received excellent merchandise and great service. Would highly recommend it to others. Bought as a gift for Christmas for son-in-law.
3,"Inside of ""Inside, Inside, Inside"" - a review","I think the 'professional' reviewers did a fine job of summarizing the plot so I won't comment on that, other than to say that this is an excellent opportunity to discuss with preschoolers and kindergarteners the various concepts involved in the word 'inside'. [Inside a box; inside of a state; inside of a country.]The artwork is colorful and appealing, the children seem personable enough, and my children (3 and 5; boy and girl) liked the story enough to hear it through a few times, but the ""Booklist"" reviewer was right in that it seems a little long.In addition, I would add that there is only so much interest that can be aroused by what's inside another thing. Or to put it more bluntly, this book wasn't very interesting to us after a few days.Three Stars. Nice artwork. A chance to discuss the concept of 'inside'. But generally, an odd little book that is probably worth checking out of the library, but not purchasing."
5,An incredible moon study guide,"As an amateur astronomer, I love observing and studying the moon. This book is the ultimate study guide for someone interested in learning about every major feature of the moon. The book takes the reader through a complete journey of the moon starting with a waxing crescent moon through to a full moon. Each day, those features that are evident along the terminator are displayed photographically with text describing the features. All pictures are shown in both ""standard"" view and mirror image view which enables the user to see the view displayed by their telescope. If you want to learn about the moon, this is the book for you."
1,Recommended for insomniacs.,"An insipid plot line and sterotypical characters make for a very dull book. The conflict is the overused Great Misunderstanding between hero and heroine, who spends most of the novel assuming the worst behavior of the hero without giving him the opportunity to explain his actions or even understand her accusations. The hero, on the other hand, spends much time rescuing her from her ignorance and poor education. Despite his lessons, the turning point doesn't come until she gets a pair of eyeglasses, and then she is magically transformed into a thoughtful political writer. (Note to author: as character development, eyeglasses leave much to be desired.) The comical minor characters provide the only glimmer of entertainment. Highly recommended reading for insomniacs."
3,Captivating,"Cassandra Merlin has an unsavory reputation, no money, no ""connections,"" and no family to speak of, save an estranged father who has been accused of treason against his country. Needless to say, her prospects for a happy, comfortable future are, predictably, dim. Such are the circumstances that lead Cassandra to agree to become a spy. Riordan, a man of wealth and station, is Cassandra's ""contact"" in this spy game, and, of course, believes the worst of her in the beginning, which makes for a somewhat antagonistic relationship between the two, though a growing passion looms beneath the surface.Cassandra and Riordan take on spy personas of unscrupulous jades, which serves to compound the sexual tension between them.The romance is exciting and the spy intrigue interesting, but the continuous misunderstandings between Riordan and Cassandra become just a tad overdone, as in one too many. This is my only criticism of an otherwise very satisfying read from, in my opinion, a gifted writer."
3,"ambition can get you three, not five","Hickey tries hard, and gets the best people. If he used those qualities to produce, and let the stars do the playing and singing, he could do well."
1,not very impressed,bought the book and read it. Was not very impressed with the authors knowledge on the subject. Smacks more of commercialsm than anything else. If one truly wants to learn more on this subject. I advise to read on Aryeh Kaplans writing or those of the Breslov reseach Center. You get something more designed to teach than to sell.
1,I'm an idiot or...,"I had this in my wish list and my husband bought it for me as a gift. I was thrilled...and then I started reading. And it didn't make sense. So I read it again. Then a 3rd time. Then I made my husband read it. I was beginning to think I was a bigger idiot than I ever imagined! My husband is almost a genius (don't tell him I say so!), and even HE didn't know what I was supposed to be doing.I think part of the problem is the ""oh you can do whatever you want, that's the great part about it"". No, you CAN'T do whatever you want. It's a VERY specific process...and it's almost like it was so vague and generic that she could have been talking about making ANYTHING. I am not a whimsical person, I like a plan, I need a list of instructions to get through something. And this book was awful for that. It didn't tell me how to do a darn thing!"
5,every thing you need to know,"very informative and practical! the book takes you from first step to last not fogeting to explain every step of the way!it can be comfterbly used by total beginers - the more practist reader will find new facts, clarafy standing questions and give a stronger base for creativity!very good writing and explanations.highly recomended!"
2,Reliable FireWire cables are thicker than this,"Despite its great form factor and portability, I can't recommend this product. I got one and promptly wasted an entire night trying to make a FireWire connection between two notebook computers running Windows XP. Much effort was expended, in the end demonstrating that the cable was defective. An ordinary, nonretractable, much thicker 4-4 FireWire cable was purchased as a replacement the next day, and worked first try. The moral of the story: don't go light/flimsy on a cable that you need to get something to work!"
4,Great Product,"The film went on very well... Several weeks later, there are no scratches at all, it remains perfect just as it went on the first day.Only complaint (why I gave a 4): The screen protector piece is not the same material, it relies on static adhesive rather than sticky glue. This resulted in having to slide it back on rather often. (it also seemed to scratch)Problem solved though after an email or two to NLU, they whipped up a new piece relying on the sticky glue and quickly sent it to me, free of charge. This new piece protects the screen perfectly.In its current state, it's definitely a 5 star."
3,wigmaker speaks,"this has a very helpful book, but i wish that the haircutting section had final pictures of the cuts. actually, i wish that the book had more ""real"" pictures than drawings. still, as a wigmaker, i tend to style a lot of 40s hairstyles, so i'm pretty happy with it"
4,Romance is back here,"This book enables the reader to use thier own imagination when they view the various and beutiful styles. The graphic and detailed photos are successful in keeping the reader interested. The best thing I like about this book is that it recreates the romance of the 40's by presenting all these stylish, conservative yet sexy hair do's."
3,"Great history, superficial mechanics","I was mixed on this book. It presented a wonderful history and philosophical background for Hsing-Han Liu's Ba Gua, but the palms shown were the simplest levels (predominately qi gung), the applications were rudimentary (perhaps even watered down), and the mechanics simplistic. For a book that started to emphasize energy, proceeded to walking qi gung palms, a more appropriate finale would have been more sophisticated energy applications and/or development. Real insights from this incredibly experienced Ba Gua master would have been nice, and invaluable."
2,Disappointing,"After seeing O FANTASMA, the first feature of Joao Pedro Rodrigues, I had high expectations for TWO DRIFTERS. Unfortunately, it did not deliver. There were numerous problems, an implausible storyline and frustrating characters chief among them. It meandered far too much and ultimately ended on a ridiculous note. I recall reading favorable reviews of this film and was anxious to buy the DVD. I doubt it will remain in my library - it just wasn't terribly engaging and suggests Joao Pedro Rodrigues took far too formulaic a path in constructing this work both substantively and dramatically. I also feel the development and rather dark transformations of his two leads seemed to follow the same trajectory as his lead character in O FANTASMA. It just didn't resonate with me."
2,a product best avoided,"piicture is misleading. The garment is very loose fitting. It is a thong, not a jockstrap. Sorry I bought it."
4,Loved it as a child.,"This books was first published in the 50's. I read it as a child and loved it. I was curious as to how I would like it now. I found the time era charming. I liked words like keen and swell. I liked the descriptions of braille and other training. There was some silliness which underestimated the eleven year old boy when he first became blind. Most people can dress in the dark by then. Overall, it was a simple, but interesting read."
4,Excellent book for children,"I enjoy reading good children's books even though technically I've ""outgrown"" them. This one was very absorbing and a wonderful story that every child should read - or have read to them by a parent or relative or somebody, because adults can enjoy it and benefit from it as well.I won't say anything about the story, but the characters are all very nice. Jimmy's sister is helpful, his teacher and friends are kind, and Jimmy is ultimately forgiving and goes on bravely - very good role-models for young readers to acquaint themselves with.I don't know exactly what else to say except that I recommend this book very highly."
4,Great sturdy 2-line cordless phone,"I spent 2 weeks looking for a cordless 2-line phone that looked decent and wasn't too flimsy. I now have the ATT E2562 since 2 weeks. I'm using the it with a regular phone line and a Vonage VOIP phone line. Caller ID works flawlessly with both lines.Base station and handsets have built-in speaker phone that works better than any other speaker phone that I'm familiar with except Polycoms.Set-up was very easy, design is nice.Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that you can't upload or synchronize phone books (tested an Olympia Bluetooth cordless, but it was too flimsy), but have to punch in all the info."
1,partially working phone,We had to return this phone because the answering function worked on line 2 but not line 1
2,PLEASE PROVIDE A WORKING SYSTEM,"We tested Model 2462, two different bases, cut off messages. They sent us this upgraded model, E2562. Switching lines is very difficult at the base, however, not a problem that can't be worked around. But, when line one is placed on hold to answer line two, line one is disconnected. Not acceptable! Especially in a business environment. Too bad, because the voice quality is great. So far only one day of lost messages (hopefully a fluke)."
3,hmm.. so-so,"For the price I paid ($145) this phone has a looot of shortcomings. For e.g., if you pick up the receiver, there's no way to press the redial option. The redial option is only available on the screen when the phone is on the hook. Secondly, if line 2 rings and you pick the phone up, it goes into line 1. Instead of line 2 (duh..)The cordless has a very short battery life has to be constantly recharged!!Also, if you have a power cut, both phones don't work. I bought this one thinking at least the corded phone would work (GE has a model like that) but unfortunately, I was mistaken.It's a good phone all-in-all, and serves the purpose of a 2-line corded + cordless set, but it's overpriced. Next time I'm sticking with GE!"
5,Great Stuff,"I've seen it three times, a wonderful Donald Pleasence, a great cast for a great performance, a beautiful Rome, the machete chops and a technically perfect music, made me feel the fear and the magic in a way I was never used to."
2,No valance included,"Picture shows valance, do not be misled, there is no valance in package. Quality not so good--rather thin, but grandson loves star wars & he is happy. You will have to purchase valance separately--not worth the money."
5,Star Wars Drapes,Drapes were well made and the fabric is sturdy. They were actually longer than I needed and I was able to shorten them and use what I cut off to make a valance. My grandson is happy.
2,Efficiency Problems,"This dishwashing detergent did get my dishes clean if I had my dishes stacked just so. The problem is that if you have a detergent dispenser with a door that opens at the right time(which most washers do) you cannot utilize the space around that door. If ANYTHING is hindering that door from opening ALL THE WAY the tab does not come out and fully clean the dishes. I will be going back to liquid as soon as this box is done. I have had to rewash several loads because of this so, due to this being somewhat expensive detergent, the sometimes double use of water and electricity and not being able to get as many dishes in, it will not be on my next shopping list."
1,stay away,"If you are truly interested in the REAL Bonnie & Clyde stay away from this book. I started to read it and could not believe how bad it was. What I read was pure conjecture and cheap romance novel. ""Running with Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""21st Century Update"" are worth reading, but this is definitely not. I have read nearly every book on this subject and this is the worst by far."
4,Great if you love Donny and Marie,"If you are a real fan of Donny and Marie and don't mind live recordings then this is a good cd. There doesn't seem to be a lot of audience applause during this recording which almost makes me feel sad for D&M, however, it was recorded in the 80's when I think their popularity had begun to fade a bit. I have always love D&M so I enjoyed the cd. Also, alot of the songs are ones that have been recorded by other artists (such as Tammy Wynette's Stand by your Man (which Marie sings) and the Pointer Sisters I'm So Excited (which Donny sings). They do snippets of some of the songs that they made popular together but not too many. Anwyay, if you love D&M as I do, then you will enjoy this cd. If you are just a so-so fan, then I wouldn't necessarily purchase this particular cd. Go for one of the Best of ... cd's."
4,Wholesome fun,"I have been a fan since day one, of the music and of what I know of the family and their values. The dynamics between brother and sister never fail to impress or delight. Previous reviews indicated disappointment in the over-all quality, but I did not find this to be the case. Two negatives: I wanted more traditional tracks, and I wanted more, more more! Having the opportunity to see these two in concert, I promise you the CD delivers the same high quality performance, energy, and fun. Donny's enthusiasm and authentic happiness is contagious, and Marie's never-failing beauty and grace enchants."
3,Need more than one,"I thought this would be a good addition to my regular work out. Unfortunately, you really need two of these and probably more than two pounds each to get anything from it. I may spend more time trying to figure out how to use it but for now, it's not getting much use. I'm back to my old 2 lb punching weight that I can easily hold in my hand."
4,"Pressuppositional apologetics, boiled down to essentials","Whenever the topic of pressupositional apologetics comes up, it tends to cause the eyes to gloss over and the mind to immediately assume it is in way over its head. Dr. Bahnsen's works can be some of the most intellectually demanding works of theology one can encounter so it was with some concern when I picked up this book and wondered how it would communicate the topic. Dr. Bahnsen proved that it is possible to boil the topic down into its essential elements for evangelism and make it clear to the average reader and to the philosophy nuts alike. It is a great defense of the methodology as it relates to evangelism and is an invaluable resource for sharing your faith."
5,Review of Purchase from Murray's Discount Auto Store,"Thr product received was exactly what I had ordered. It was delivered within a few days of purchase, was properly packaged and I am totally satisfied with the purchase and the seller."
4,Is there a problem?,"Mrs. Aldermann is angry. She is angry with herself for having had a heart attack. One deadheads so the young flowers can grow she instructs her grandnephew Patrick.Fast forward and Patrick Aldermann is a grown man, an accountant with a wife and the extensive garden Mrs. Aldermann had. A co-worker has reason to wonder about his conduct and contacts Andrew Dalziel and Peter Pascoe. Amusingly, Peter's wife Ellie commences a friendship with Aldermann's wife at about the same time. It turns out that Dalziel went to school with Patrick Aldermann's mother. Pascoe visits a former employer of Patrick Aldermann and the information is not favorable to Aldermann.There is a lot of local scene-setting in the story adding to its interest and its tone. The book has rounded characters and presents puzzles not easily solved."
5,Saucony Shadow 6000,I'm amazed that Saucony has produced this shoe for so many years. I think they are one of the best running shoes for the money.
2,Horror movie and Jeff Fahey fans only need apply..,This movie is a typical horror movie/teenage slasher flick starring the wonderful Jeff Fahey. It is actually one of the more watchable movies he has recently made. If you like Jeff (he is really nice looking in this one) and/or typical horror movies with an ending screaming for a sequel you'll like this one.
2,New Age/ Mystic slight of hand,"New Age Themes, Old Time Mystacism, Eastern Philosophy and a measure of Christianity are all combined to resurect the Abundance we are, by divination, all entitled to (according to the author). Lost in this homogenized approach to the spriritual pursuit of ""Abundance"" is the simple truth that Abundance must be hard won. This success comes through preparation, deligence in work, frugality, & good stewardship. No slight of hand will conjure up even spiritual Abundance."
5,What A Powerful Book,"What a powerful book this is and yet a quick read. Simple yet very in-depth. I am well into the 40 days, and when I missed one day near the beginning, I did start over. There is an energy that is created and maintained throughout the 40 day period, and it is a practice that needs to become a daily habit. I am an avid student and teacher of the Law of Attraction and Prosperity Thinking, and a Prosperity Guide and Life Management Coach. This book is a must read. It should be a staple in the library of every LOA student and teacher. I am part of a small group, and we are doing this program together, and we are having amazing results. I am thrilled with this little powerful book."
1,If he's not an opera singer why is he singing opera?,"I read many of the comments about people saying that they like Bocelli's Tosca even though they understand that it's not the real thing.C'mon guys, can you say that Carlo Rossi (cheap jug wine) is a good wine after you've known some of the better ones? Worse yet, in this case this recording is even more expensive than the better recordings on the subject. I would definitively suggest that people listened to Callas-DiStefano on this opera (just to name one of the better ones) before saying that this is a good Tosca.By the way, Pavarotti should have NEVER recorded Tosca; if you MUST listen to one of the three tenores on this one, go with Carreras, he's the least bad of the three."
2,Borrrring!,"Perhaps I'm missing something. But the story line was very slow and nothing much really happened. It was neither compelling, insightful, funny, and not even erotic, albeit it seems to be headed in that direction occassionally but never gets there. The ending was cute, but that pretty much sums it up."
5,A little gem of insight into human nature,"And I thought I'd be the first to review this book! :)Oh, I absolutely loved it. I loved it so much I now want to read everything by this author. I've read it so many times it's fallen to bits! I don't know how the author does it, but you can feel so much understanding and compassion in every word his characters say. It is quite slow-paced mainstream fiction although it picks up closer to the end, but all I can say, read it, and you'll never be the same."
5,Really soothing and comforting,"I love this chapstick and won't buy any other brands. I love the smell, kind of a cooling, tingling, refreshing blast for your lips. It melts onto your lips for perfect coverage, not at all waxy."
5,"Terrific Product, Very Invigorating","I have used Cherry Chapstick for as long as I can remember, and I still love it, but I will now be periodically switching off with Beeswax Lip Balm. I didn't think anything could ever make me want to add variety to my Cherry Chapstick regimen, but I was wrong. Beeswax Lip Balm is minty and invigorating, and it feels nice. I have always loved beeswax candles. I now love this product as well.J.H. Sweet, author of The Fairy Chronicles, and Burt's Bees Enthusiast"
5,best lip balm,Lives up to its claims of being the world's best lip balm. It doesn't put a shiny film on your lips rather it penetrates leaving it feeling moisturized. This is one lip balm I keep going back to after trying different lip balms. Too bad this hasn't got any SPF. There's Burt's Bees' Lifeguard's Choice but I really don't fancy it. It leaves a white stain on your lips.
4,Not your typical USB Mini connector,"I bought this thinking it had the thin and wide USB mini connector (the kind you see most often on portable devices, aside from USB micro connectors). This, however, has a square-like connector. I have never seen a device that uses this, so I'm not sure what to do with it. The cable does retract well, though. Giving it 4 stars for apparent build quality (I can't test the cable on anything). A more detailed description or extra product photos would help tremendously."
3,Just not what I expected.,"There are some good songs on this album. And some that just didn't do anything for me. It's different from other soundtracks in that there are soundbites from the movie. But, that doesn't justify the money for the CD. While I thought ""Sinister Urge"" rocked, this CD doesn't. But it is good enough for 3 stars, and if you make your own CD's, there are a couple of songs worth rippin'. By it used friends!!!"
2,Not what I was hoping for,"This soundtrack did not live up to my expectations at all. There are a few good Rob Z toons on it, especially Brick House 2003, but, that is about it. There are no long, moody-spookie tracks on it, the isolated clips are trite, and I could have lived without the Slim Whitman and Buck Owens.If you are hoping for another Rob Zombie album, this is not it. At best, look at it as a CD-Single, a few good tracks and a lot of spare baggage from the movie. Sorry Rob..."
5,Well described..,"Well described, the author succeded on the matters related to the actions and reactions of Gral. Kutusov and Emperor Napoleon. Geopolitical issues are well served on the text."
4,stuck in neutral,I thought this book was a great way to show kids our age how hard it was to live in the situation that he was. I recomend that all students should read this book if look down on other people.
5,Praise for Ms. Bujold,"This is one of my favorite books by one of my favorite authors. Coupled with ""the Paladin of Souls"" it makes a duet of mystical fantasy."
3,Nothing out of ordinary,"This is a reasonably well-crafted book, but without any trace of the originality I was hoping for. The setting is undistinguishable from a number of other fantasies. There are some memorable and well-written characters in the book (for one, Iselle, a strong-minded princess and Cazaril, a stoic noble), but they do not make up for the hype. I was glad I waited for the library copy to get to me, and did not buy it, as I intended."
2,I don't get it,"I bought this book because I had just finished Bujolds's Sharing Knife series and enjoyed it. Since this book has higher ratings than that series, I was looking forward to it. But I had to force myself to slog through the first 40% of the book. It picked up after that, but was still only an okay read. The book is a standard sword and romance medieval-type fantasy. Even the main character is not well-developed and all the other characters were worse. The only characters I could reliably identify after they hadn't been written about recently were the 2 villians and the 2 main women. And those women were indistinguishable from each other. If this book had been much shorter, it would have been much better. The best part of the book was the well-developed religious beliefs, which were interesting and unusual."
5,An intreging story set in a complex world.,"In The Curse of Chalion, Lois McMaster Bujold considers a variety of relisous questions regarding the nature of sainthood, of demons, and of God. Her characters are personable and interesting and the delemas they face are compelling."
3,More a YA story...,"...than 4 adults. Typical good vs. evil tale a honerable man picked by the gods 2 remove a black curse from a royal bloodline. Good points: 1) Storyline is well paced with hardly a dull moment. 2) I saw only 1 typo on my Kindle edition. 3) Story set in an interesting world similar 2 medievil Europe, but with 4~5 revered gods influencing fste.Not good points: 1) Main character is a bit too god to believe; he should have waffled a bit before making each of his life~threatening decisions. 2) There was never any doubt that good would win out over evil and that the main character would live to be with his love. 3) The mystical parts were porely explained and seemed 2 be lacking details.Because of the not good points and because of the overall simplicity of themes, I felt that this book would be better enjoyed by the ""Harry Potter"" readers instead of adults. In conclusion, I would recomend this book to YAs or adults looking for a light read."
5,Masterful!,"One of the best books I've read for a while. Great story, great characters, very satisfying. I've read several of the authors books this one is the best so far."
5,"Truly, A Wonderful Book","It's rare for me to give out a five-star rating, but The Curse of Chalion has earned it and deserves it. This is the first book I've ever read by Bujold and it makes me want to read her other novels. The Curse of Chalion features one of the most well-developed plots I've read in a long while. Reading more like a medieval historical novel with a dash of fantasy -- mostly in the form of a mythological religion -- the novel is a slow burn that keeps building until the finale is finally reached. Along the way we're treated to exceptionally well-developed characters, an interesting world, and one of the most original high fantasy novels to come along in some time. No one who enjoys intelligently written fantasy or historical fiction will be disappointed in The Curse of Chalion."
5,The Best Camcorder Under $200 Ever!!,"I purchased this product in August of 2006 soley based on the positive word of mouth that it has received. And it was one of the most satisfying and suprising purchases I have ever made. There are many, many hybrid digital camcorder, mp3 players, cameras out there. This one does one thing; takes great movies. I have tested many of these economical alternatives and the Point And Shoot takes the best low light movies out of all of them. This was a total suprise considering it doesn't contain any special light gathering sensors. And transferring the movies to DVD is a cinch with windows Movie Maker or any other create a DVD program. Buy this product, you will definately not regret it."
3,Handy Camcorder,"This is a great little camcorder to have in your purse when you are out and about without a regular video camera. It doesn't last a long time, but it is enough for trips to the park or a special school assembly without all the hassle of a huge video camera to deal with. It does go through the batteries though, so make sure you get rechargeable batteries!!"
3,"Easy to use, Quality OK","Like others mentioned, this is a really easy to use device. No manual, no software CD. Open the box and you know how to use it right there. The quality is OK. I was watching it on TV and computer, It is like the Hi8 kind of quality. On computer, can't use the whole screen. It didn't look good. (BTW, I only got yesterday, so only shot in a lower light condition)Downloading to PC can take a while. 5 mins video is about 100MB. To me, probably makes more sense using video funtion in a digital camera. At leasat, you can take both still picture and video chip.[...]"
4,Digital camcorder,"This product met my expectations, and then some. My daughter loved it's small size, easy use, and quick download capabilities. It has sufficient internal memory for lots of video, and the picture quality is great. If you're looking for a great zoom, this is not the camcorder, but for fun video, indoors and out, it's a great buy."
2,trite,"The Stryder is basically a bad Saves The Day clone. You'de be better off just buying a Saves The Day CD. Hell their original bassist even left the band to play in Saves The Day (good call Eben). By the way, if you ever have the chance to see the Stryder live don't. They are one of the worst live bands that I've ever seen."
4,Love These Boots!,I love these boots. They're so much fun! Don't let the height of the heel scare you...the platform actually makes the heel shorter when it comes to foot placement. Only problem - the laces don't stay laced when they're not on your feet. You'll have to relace them each time.
3,How to write a one-line summary of an eternal religious text,"This isn't the best translation of the Koran. I'd go for a different one. Also, if you've never read the Koran before or don't have a backround on Mohammed's life, better get a companion book too as it may seem like rhetoric from a western eye."
1,Feeling of cheap plastic,"This is one of those items I wished I could touch before I bought. I is accurately described, but when you get it, there's this shiny sheen to it that reminds me of plastic. I expected the rod iron you would normally see, but it wasn't. Oh well. I would not recommend unless you plan on painting or putting far, far away."
1,cover did not fit,"I gave two bowls as gifts, and I did not know about the covers not fitting until my recipients told me many months later--too late to send them back. I am looking for two properly fitting covers, but no luck."
1,LID DOES NOT FIT,"the lid never fit the bowl... contacted Tupperware, just like the other review said - they tell you to put it in hot water - but as soon as the lid cools it pops right off. USELESS"
1,Only 1,"the advertising for this product was very misleading. There was only 1 pan in an order... Not 5 as the picture shows. Seriously, who would pay 6.99 for one 2"" pan? NOT ME!"
2,Cheap,Right color but not good to use when making stocking caps as product does not give. It also takes quite a bit more as this yarn is very thin!!!!!
3,Caribou lacking,"Despite having one the best songs Elton John and Bernie Taupin have ever penned together in ""Ticking"", I find the rest the album lacking compared to anything they had done in the the past. It also falls far short of their following release 'Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy'. I am not particularly fond of the two singles ""The [...] is Back"" or ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"" although I feel the latter is much easier on the ear than the former. That being said, it is early Elton John, and I feel you could find worse albums than this to add to your collection. It is worth buying for ""Ticking "" alone. It is seven minutes and 36 seconds of genius."
4,Little known classic from the golden age,"This is a flawed classic from Eltons golden period when he was selling more records than anybody else on the planet. There are a some all-time classic Elton tracks in the ""The Bitch is Back"" and ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"" as well as ""Pinball Wizard"", which is a extra track on this CD.The main difference with this album over say his other classic albums of the 70's is the addition of the Tower of Power horn section. This adds some umph to the whole proceedings. So very average Elton songs like ""Your so Static"" and ""Stinker"" (both of which I love) become much funkier affairs.Overall then this is an underrated album, that whilst not quite as good as GYBR or Tumbleweed Connection, is far better than its given credit for."
4,Outernet: Friend or Foe,"Outernet is about a boy named Jack, and his two friends Merle and Loaf. For Jack's birthday he gets a laptop. at first he thinks it is an ordinary laptop, but when he and his friends open it they find out that it is a computer that leads to the Outernet, an intergalactic internet, but some 'bad guys' are trying to find it. They are trying to find it because that is all they need in order to control the galaxy which would mean no freedom for others.I liked Outernet because it was a book that was more straight to the point. It also had lots of action. I also liked it because it was just a good science - fiction book. One dislike I had of the book was that the end sort of dragged."
5,And just like that... he exploded on stage,"If you thought Buck Fever was good (Even though this was released before) then this one will also blow your mind. If you're into different music, and really like Estradasphere's work being, Hispanic-gypsy-redneck-funk-jazz fusion-black metal and more then you'll love this album, in fact, the first song will pull you right in."
5,Classical teachings for today's world,"This is by a Sufi Shaykh of the Naqshbandi Order whose line now extends to the US through his khalif, Shaykh Ahmed Abdur Rashid. The book is a concise and focused address to anyone who wants to have an authorized explanation of key questions about Sufism and its meditation practices. In Q & A format, the topics range from the specific to the historical, which includes a brief biography of Sayyid 'Abd al-Bari Shah. The book also includes a brief biography of Shaykh Azad Rasool (written by Shaykh Rashid), a glossary of Arabic words relevant to Sufism as part of the text, several pages of notes in the back to explain concepts and give citations. And there is an appendix of the silsila (chain of authority) of several orders that Shaykh Azad Rasool and Shaykh Rashid are khalifas of. The book is written in a format that is easy to read. Great for students and those just curious. An especially good resource book."
3,Problematic....,"This movie is problematic in many ways. Basically, the problem is this: if you want to watch this movie, you probably already know about Friedman and Sonney. However, if you already have watched a few SW commentary tracks, or read the book ""Grindhouse"" or other such works, nothing in this movie will really be new to you at all. It isn't bad, per se, as an overview of the exploitation genre, but it also doesn't break any new ground. What's more, it defies expectations by not really having Friedman or Sonney speak to their movies other than in a general sense. Friedman never mentions HGL, which is annoying to me since they talked about blood feast. I liked this movie more while I was watching it than I did a few days later..."
3,"Subtitle: 1,001 similies","I agree with other reviewers who, on the whole, enjoyed this book, but I am surprised that no one mentioned the author's distracting writing style. Though I did not undertake an exact count, there are approximately 3-4 similies per page on average, and often 2 or 3 in a single sentence. Even in the most comepelling sections of the book I found myself suddenly distracted and jerked back to ""reality"" by such a sentence. One particularly egregious example: "". . . You can feel the eys of men slide over your body like a tongue licking an ice-cream cone. ....... "" (p.35)"
3,nice and soft,"It is soft and comfortable but... First, I would like them to be wider, to strengthen my big toe more. Second, they are too tall and sticking out of my sandals when I don't wear socks (at summer time)."
3,Of Human Bondage,"Oh! How our own age can change our views of what we read! I liked Somerset Maugham when I first began reading his work, but after reading this book again, I see that he totally portrays an attitude that seemed to prevail during those years of which he wrote. His writing is clear and quite believable, but the story left me feeling sad about the ways of life. Maybe that is what he intended."
5,Fantastic,"A moving and gripping story, simply and eloquently written. A must read for all who treasure the classics and well-told narratives about the best and worst of human relationships."
2,Dull and Lifeless,"A dull, lifeless work mired in traditional, outdated musicology. Little of the revolution in musicological thought, including social, cultural, and philsophical approaches has impacted this work. Interdiscplinary aspects of music and other arts largely are ignored.To consider Western classical music as disconnected from science, sociocultural influences, and not intimately connected to art and literature, is a travesty. This is very old school and therefore best avoided, unless one likes traditional encyclopedias (even Groves is better than this). Someone needs to overtake this franchise completely with a new work worthy of the 21st century."
5,"Touching, Inspirational and Eye-Opening!","I am a great admirer of Rhett & Link's YouTube videos, and I knew of how they had met, so I went into viewing this with all of that at the front of my mind. The pair's sense of humor and heart is at the center of this great, small-town tale of nostalgia and acceptance. Several times, I got misty-eyed and several times, I fell over laughing. It made me want to not only familiarize myself with the Native American tribes that surround me on the southern East Coast, but it also made me wonder, 'whatever happened to MY first grade teacher?'Ms. Locklear touched their lives and, because of this little film, she and her community have touched mine too."
4,Overlooked gem,"THE CASE AGAINST SATAN is about a priest and his bishop fighting to save a young girl possessed by the devil, complicated by the priest's doubting the devil really exists. The book is unfairly forgotten due to the fact the basic plot was used a decade later in THE EXORCIST. Russell's book is the better of the two, he did it first and without the excessive vulgarity of the later novel. The only weak point was the girl's Catholic bashing father and his overdramatic fate, but that doesn't detract much from the overall excellence of the book. It's too bad Russell spent more time editing than writing, for his short stories are also quite good, but hard to find."
5,This book helped my father.,"My father is in a nursing home with an Alzheimers related illness. It has been a long time since he talked about his life, rather than present time, moment-to-moment experiences. When he and I held the two-lap book and I read with him he began to brighten up and remember things, especially the drive in the country page. He remembered loving bringing his family on country drives and even mentioned places we used to go. We had one of the sweetest visits that we have had in years. Thank you for this book!I am talking to the nursing home about having several copies to read to the other patients.Corinna"
5,product met expectations,"The brass shower rod was ordered on April 2 and arrived on April 4. We were pleased with this fast response. Installation was easy, although instructions could make it a lot easier by saying that when there is no stud, drill a 1/4 inch hole for the wallboard decorator anchor. The rod looks good and provides more space for showers."
4,Gift Giver,I bought this gift for my daughter-in-law as she stated a desire to own one. She was well pleased with it and can't wait to have it 'installed' in the proper place and be able to observe activity in it.Amazon made this gift-giving purchase painless and efficent . Thank you.
5,Love this series!,"I began this book in the spring and couldn't put it down. The characters and plot lines are very interesting with intriguing twists and surprises. I was amazed at the final chapters and couldn't wait to read more. Fortunately, I was given the second book in the series soon after. I have just finished that as well...again...couldn't put it down. I looked forward to reading it often to find out what was going to happen. I highly recommend this wonderful series. I look forward to reading the next one this fall. Very well done with some brilliant passages!"
1,Old movie - Terrible quality BEWARE!,"Okay! I started to watch this DVD, but it was not possible because the picture quality was terrible, Come On Now! Amazon should not allow this! However, I love Amazon! Refund no questions asked!"
1,Great Stories but ...,"Contains GREAT stories from an old school airline guy but is perhaps one of the most poorly written, poorly edited books that I've ever read. Beck's writing style is extremely distracting and again, aside from the stories, his quips are not at all clever or amusing. He would have a huge hit on his hands had he engaged the assistance of a writer or an editor to help him with the book. I can't believe that this thing even got published."
1,Morbidity is no escape from mortality,"At the core of morbidity is the desperate longing to control the uncontrollable, the fact that we all will die. Films like this give the watcher an empty illusion of being god-like observers of others' suffering and fate.If you find watching animals and people suffer and die entertaining, I think you're weak, not strong or tough. Turn it off and look at the mortality of yourself and those around you and let death guide you in valuing life.Life is not a movie. Life is not TV. Don't give in to your own desensitization. You will only be throwing away the only tender soul you've been given..."
1,Too bad I pulled of the tag,"Ok watch but not to my liking once I read the manual. You'd think for this amount of money they would be able to have a calendar that you don't have to reset once a month and a 24 hour alarm. Unfortunately, I took off the tag that has ""Not returnable if tag is removed"" (printed on only one side). Don't believe that these are returnable. You can only return if you haven't worn it, haven't removed any of the tags, etc. etc."
3,Tough Luck :-(,"I really loved this watch by the very looks of it, I also have belief & faith in citizen watches, have 4 Citizen watches myself!!!Unfortunately the watch I received is aesthetically perfect but it seems I have got a piece with a faulty solar cell, the charge never moves from level 2 or rather never gets fully charged!!, dont know if it is faulty, tried charging in full sun light & internal light for almost 7 hours, in vain.A double whammy to my bad luck : I gifted this watch to my brother in law in India, now I cant get it back easily to get it resolved, got subjected to some unsaid, untold but spoken family embarrassment.Truly a big $525 blow...."
5,10 stars if I could,"The 30 reviews before mine gave pretty complete description about the watch. I'll just say it fits very well on my relatively small wrist.If you like the watch but think it won't fit well because you have small wrist. Don't worry, it fits just fine. Enjoy.After wearing this watch for few weeks, I realized I am just like many others, wearing the Calibre 2100 exclusively now."
4,"Good, but no Dawn of the Dead","I think this book was a fun read, as I love reading about zombies and end of the world scenarios. But it just lacked something. It was a good sequel to the first one though. But for zombie fans, I do give it four stars, so check it out."
4,"Emo-Punk, but pure fun!","Ive only listened to a borrowed copy of this cd, but I loved It right away. Its melodic(emo style) and intense (punk style) which are my two favourite types of music. I definetly recommend this album to any fans of Weezer, Sunny Day Real Estate, or MxPx. My favourite tune is Touch my fuzz, or the one directed at ""Punk named Josh"". If you, buying this is a possibility, please do. You wont be disappointed!"
3,Cute but not quite what I was hoping.,"I bought this box so I can have my kids place their tooth in it, under their pillow and am mixed in how much I like it. It is cute, seems to be well finished but the lid doesn't stay on well (it is a loose fit) and it is a little larger than I had imagined. A tooth would swim in it, especially a baby tooth! I am not unhappy with it but not sure this is the direction I will go when my son looses his next tooth."
5,A one-stop book that answers beginners basic questions.,"I purchased this book because it answered basic power boating questions in one convenient book. The answers could have been found by pouring over a multitude of boating magazines. Much that is covered here can be found in the ""classic"" books. This book isn't as dry and is well written. A classic book like ""Chapmans piloting, seamanship and smallboat handling"" (an important resource) is awfully daunting to a beginner anxious to get out on the water. Every beginner should read Bob's chapter on, ""Why boats don't behave like cars.""I especially liked the early on comparison of the 3 hull types and of the power types - these are some of the first questions a new boater must tackle to make an intelligent choice when shopping for a boat. This book also covers the basics of docking and use of docklines. This isn't the only book you'll buy but it is a good start by a competent, organized writer/seaman. Jeff Siddons"
2,Much better books available on subject,I bought a boat this summer and was looking for a good general introduction to boating. I was very disappointed with this book. The text was often too techinical or just plain lacking in information.Since reading this book I've taken the U.S. Power Squadron boating course and have read The Complete Idiot's Guide to Boating. Both of these were much more useful than this text.
4,about the movie/film Internal Affairs.........,"I bought this DVD from Singapore videoshops....hee hee and have watched them. The main issue of this movie is actually to catch whom is the killer in a cop department. Recommended to those whom are interested in this genre of movie/film.....Review by:Dr, Prof (PhD)Ang Poon Kahsubmission of TC to get university award.Syncast for Mystery of the nile.Imagine entertainment for film/movie the Da Vinci Code.Zakkers film director."
2,internal affairs,"this is a good movie and the dvd is in good condition but i dont like ordering movie that come in a jewel case instead of their original case, if their not in their own case the customer needs to be informed before ordering."
4,Travel to the Moon,"What child does not want to be an astronaut when they grow up? Traveling in space, walking on the moon: How amazing! This book allows children to explore their curiosity and excitement about the moon. It is well illustrated and the narration is interesting and keeps their attention. They are learning, yet it is fun. It is unique because the story is supplemented with short teaching times referring the child to the pictures on the page. (Even I learned a few things about the moon.) My son has always wanted to ride in a space ship... Now he wants to live on the moon! ""It is so cool,"" he said. I highly recomend this book."
2,Hey Joe! Where ya goin' with that gun in yer hand?,"They just do not build space ships the way they used to, so this one has to make a pit stop on earth. The occupant gets wrapped up in a local family squabble. More deadly than army tanks is a domestic squabble with rednecks (from Maryland). In the tussle the local baddy and a floozy just may get bumped off.Will the visitor (green man from space, not to get mixed up with our local green man of garden pundits) get away?Or will Joe take a flying leap?Ether ways we will be intrigued with this look in to domestic co-dependency.This film was SHOT entirely on location in Maryland.Some where out there is a torn T-shirt that was the key prop and possible the best actor in the film. I wonder what it would bring in auction."
5,3 sheets is 5 stars!,"Any travelers that also enjoy social drinking will enjoy this show. The host experiences the culture, history of areas around the world by sampling the local favorite drinks.There's also a fun drinking game to play while watching this show!"
2,IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS I REMEMBERED!!!!,"My family got cable tv in the early 80's, and I remember, as a kid, watching Dr. Detroit several times and liking it a lot. I even taped it so that I could watch it when cable stopped showing it as much. Well, flash forward over twenty years later and I just watched it again and, for whatever reason, the movie just didn't do it for me. I chuckled a few times at some of the situations, but no out loud laughs. The ""Dr. Detroit"" persona seemed more stupid than funny. The ""Mom"" character that I remembered as so funny...wasn't. Obviously, this movie is just not as good as I remembered. The only memory of the film that I had that DOES still hold up is Donna Dixon: she IS as unbelievably gorgeous as I thought. But since there's no Donna Dixon nudity here, I can't find any reason to recommend it."
5,Forces Of Tae Kwon Do,My 2 children are referring to this book to constantly develop themselves. It is easy for my 2nd grader to understand and practice. We highly recommend.
1,Bad Cassette,"I cannot review this book on tape (purchased used) as the first of two cassettes, containing the bulk of the material was twisted and shredded when it arrived., Sorry."
3,"Good fun, but not his best Burglar IMHO","While Lawrence Block's Burglar series is a bit formulaic (some of the scenes are virtual repeats, at times), his characters are simply a riot. The plot is probably not the best part of these books--the characters and dialog are. So, if you are looking for a hard boiled or serious mystery, read Block's Scudder series or an Agatha Christie. While there is fun in this book (I would prefer to give it 3.5 stars) and a great quote for my collection: ""I swear, if jumping weren't allowed she'd never get to a conclusion"" on page 180), this is not, IMHO, his best Burglar/Rhodenbarr book. Try ""The Burglar Who Traded Ted Williams"" or the new ""The Burglar on the Prowl,"" for instance. Still, I'd recommend reading them all as light entertainment, similar to Block's Tanner series. I must admit, I like the Scudder ones better."
5,Great Replacement filter,"We have a Culligan two stage filter under our kitchen sink that feeds both a drinking water tap on the sink and also feeds our fridge water/icemaker and dispenser. The water we have in our part of Florida has an unpleasant taste and odor. After trying several filters we found that using an inexpensive ""coarse"" filter (filters larger impurities) ahead of the GE filter gives us wonderful tasting water for around 6 months before replacing. The GE filter performs a very fine filtration that eliminates 95+ percent of all things that could foul the taste or smell.Highly recommended."
