3,"Ok gate, but latch broke in 3 months","We bought this gate to separate our cats litter and food in one room so the dog can't get it. It's a solid gate and keeps our medium sized dog out just fine. Everything was working well until a few weeks ago when the latch mechanism stopped working. One day I lifted the handle and the gate wouldn't open - I had to push back the opening mechanism myself. It's not a huge deal, but is sort of annoying that it happened after only have the gate 3 months."
4,Mary,"This is a very well made product. As an earlier reviewer stated, if you want the gate to open as advertised, you must screw the gate into your doorway. However, I installed mine without the screws and just turn the wheel just enough to loosen the gate so that it will open when I want to go through. Also as others have said, the cat door is large - large enough to allow my two puppy basset hounds through. A couple of more months, however, and I don't think they'll be able to get through.The gate is easy to install - at least without drilling holes into my doorways. It is very durable and not a bad looking gate. I have two of these in my home while I'm raising the puppies.I would give it five stars, but I think the description of the gate is somewhat deceptive in that if you want the gate to do exactly what it is advertised to do, then you must install the gate into your doorway with the screws."
4,Carlson Pet Gate,Pros: This gate allows our cats separation from our dog (puppy in training).Cons: Gate opening is a bit narrow if you are trying to carry a large object through you need to be careful or lift it over.Conclusion: This is the only gate I was able to find that offered a pet door. It seems sturdy and serves its purpose.
3,Usable,"The gate was slow to put together and tighten. One out of the three rubber ends that attach to the wall didn't extended completely. When you start to squish the gate between the walls it eventually closes all the way, however even after it was tight, the claspe never quite lines up completely."
3,works,Gate works the way it is supposed to. nice to have. great that it came with the extensions. Major bad point for me though is the latching part is NOT easy to open... not terrible once you get the hang of it but if you have kids and such it is a major hassle
3,Chow Chow can get through the door.,"The set up was really easy. Now to the issues... We have a cat and a medium sized, 45 pound, Chow Chow. We hoped that this would allow the cat to come and go as he pleases and keep our dog in the appropriate areas of the house. My dog has no problem getting in and out of that tiny door. We were shocked when he waltzed to the other side of the gate. Also, the tension is not strong enough to hold up to my dog jumping on it when we come home and consequently knocking it over without the little cups you have to nail into the wall."
5,Perfect for our needs,We have 2 cats and a new puppy. The two cats live in the master bedroom and rarely came out before. It's important that you cats and dogs have an area for themselves. Really cuts down on the fighting.We never had a problem with our puppy (Golden Lab) getting through the cat door. However I can see how it would be possible. It was pretty easy to train her not to. We started with gates that didn't have a cat door. After she got used to not being able to get through those she never really tried to get through the one with the cat door.
3,good quality gate but my 60 lb dog can slip right through the cat door,"Here is a video of my large dog going through the cat gate, we kept coming home and finding her in the bathroom (wanted to keep her out of there and keep her from eating cat poop) we werent sure if she was jumping the gate because we thought there is no way she can fit through that hole without getting stuck . she wouldnt show us how she did it because she knew she wasnt suppose to do it so i got some of her favorite food and stood in the bathroom to call her to me and see how she did it, and instantly she slips her body right through that little cat door. so this purchase was pointless for us , oh well. if you have a st bernard or a dog with a really large head it might be useful for you. [...] that is the video link copy and paste it to see"
4,Good buy!,Great item! Because it comes with extender already I am able to us it in any door in my house! It's sturdy at an affordable price. I'd watch the little knob on the 'doggie door' as your pet may chew it and have it fall off.
5,Pet gate,We bought this gate to put on our laundry room door. We were hoping to keep the baby out of the litter box. It works great! The baby can not get through and the cats figured out their door without any help. Definitely worth the money--paid about $37.
3,Good quality gate - but cat door TOO BIG,"This gate is a great price and good quality, but the main selling point is that this gate can let your cat through but not the dogs (or children.) Unfortunately the cat door is way too large.Seems like this is a pretty common problem -- our 30 lb dogs can easily wiggle their way through the cat door. We've had to secure the door off-center so that our cat can go through the larger slot on the side, but then it makes the door a bit wobbly. Also, we've got a petite 9 lb cat, so this fix may not work for larger cats."
4,Pet gate,"The Carlson pet gate works very well. I had wooden gates up and the dogs chewed the bottom, which led me to the Carlson metal gate. End of chewing."
1,Not for children,"I searched for a child-proof gate on Amazon Mom and this item shows up as one of the top results along with the Regalo gates. As I read the instructions, it says in capital letters: FOR PETS ONLY, NOT INTENDED FOR CHILDREN. - Title for this product says gate with pet door. Also the installation was needlessly awkward, as other reviewers point out - one of the mounting posts where the bolt goes through is upside down. Being returned asap."
3,"OK, but some improvements would be great","Pros:1) Nice to have the door instead of walking over a gate2) Looks nice, and it's great to have a place for the cat to go throughCons:1) The cat door closes easily, locking the cat out. It's also a tripping hazard as you're walking through the door.2) The bar across the bottom of the gate is more of a tripping hazard than I thought, and we have it at the top of the stairs.3) The wall attachments: I assume these are good if you screw them in, but we didn't want to do that with our walls, and so the rubber stoppers tend to move. If they move too much the door won't shut properly."
3,Easy to use gate but dog can climb over,Fairly easy to install. My 20 pound pitbull puppy can get through the small pet door. I know once she is bigger this won't be an issue. For now my cats have to jump over the gate. There is a horizontal bar across the top of the small pet door. After just one week of using the gate my puppy figured out that by using that horizontal bar that she can climb over the gate. So now the gate is only good if I can be there to keep an eye on her. If I leave she can get over it and destroy things.
5,Pet gate with door,"I had priced these doggie gates for a long time. The prices in all of the local stores were outrageous. Something told me to check online at Amazon. I couldn't believe that they were so affordable. I had just moved into a new place and I have three dogs, I wanted them to be contained in the kitchen area of the house so this gate has really been a lifesaver!"
5,Very Satisfied with Product,"I am very satisfied with this product- it was easy to set up, well written instructions, and works perfectly in my household. I would recommend this gate to anyone with small and large pets and/or children. The walk-through gate option is great for going in and out of the room. Everyone who has seen it has been impressed. Overall, excellent product."
4,Baby gate with dog door,This product arrived quickly and in good condition as indicated with the ad. I may end up having to buy additional extension for my situation but I am very pleased and really appreciated that the gate came with 2 extensions as part of the package.
4,wonderful metal pet gate,"Very well made latch on top keeps door secure in doorway. Adjustable ends add-ons I can use in larger entry ways like my halls if necessary. For the money and workmanship excellent for the price, and I looked. Only change I would love to see is an adjustable small pet doorway or different sizes available."
5,Great Gate holds up well,"I bought this gate about 1 year ago to keep my dogs downstairs. They have clawed it, ran into it, jumped on it and chewed on it and it held up to the abuse without even coming dislodged. I am very impressed with the product. The only thing I would change is make the ""Cat door"" smaller. medium size dogs can still fit through it."
3,Medium-sized dog slipped through.,"I thought this would do the trick, but a medium-sized dog slipped right through the cat door. It's easy to install but I wound up taking it down because the point was to keep the dog out. I was surprised the dog could fit through, but there you have it."
1,not for me,"a little cheaper than I though..it puts a lot of force on the wood in a door way, could easily cause damage. nice idea, but didn't work as I though... purchased it but probably wont use it... sticking to the cheap $10 one I have"
1,Returned it..super flimsy,"This gate would not shut properly and was really just overall cheaply made. It wouldn't hold my 16 lb baby hanging on it like all our other gates do. I this bought one for my stairs that I thought would be nice for the cats to go through but, it was so flimsy and wouldn't match up to shut properly so we returned it. I went with the dream baby gate like we have updstairs instead. They are much more steardy and close by themselves."
2,I wouldn't recommend,"I bought this gate to keep my dog out of a bedroom while letting my cat through.It was super easy to set up, but here's why I wouldn't recommend it:1. My dog can squeeze herself through the cat door. She's 45 pounds, and when I first put the gate up, she managed to get through the cat opening. It deters her because it's a challenge, but she can definitely still get into the bedroom if she wants to.2. The door is difficult to open. You have to slide a tab and then lift the handle to open the door. I don't love that..it takes two hands.I kept it because I had already set it up and didn't want to bother taking it down to return. It also isn't life-or-death to keep the dog out of the bedroom, just more of a preference.However, if you have a medium size dog and it's imperative to keep the dog out, this is not your door."
4,Does the job.,"Nothing fancy, just put in the batteries, press the button, and it makes a light. I bought it for my cats. They love to chase the little dot around all over the house, so I wasn't about to spend big $$$ on a laser pointer for them. For $8, it's fine. Only complaint would be you have to keep the button held in for the light to stay on. No way to lock the button in the ""on"" position. If I were buying a laser pointer for business reasons, I'd spend a little more, but for entertaining cats, it's all you need."
5,MICHAEL JACKSON AT HIS BEST,"Released back in 1982, Thriller topped the charts for months and sold more albums than any other, ever. If you like the 80s, must get this. If you hated the 80s, then look for some cheesy 90s pop music."
2,"Not bad for a homosexual pedophile, oh!!","Of course Billie Jean isn't his lover, but her younger brother Bobby... that's just an unproven allegation of a different color. Wacko Jacko sings with so much tension that he sounds like he's going to pop an inseam. In fact after recording he needed a two week long milk and cookie snuggle sleepover with some special ""friends"" just to take the edge off. While the songs aren't bad, the music on Thriller could be thought of more as soundtracks to the videos than as stand alone works. Because MTV played the videos so much they've been permanently burned into my retinas and consciousness. Does anybody think of anything personal when they hear these songs, or do they just replay the videos in their heads? I thought so."
4,MJ's talent is very limited,"One of the previous reviewers said 'MJ's talents know no bounds.'Hmmm...... I'd say his talent ends when you get to playing your own instruments, writing your own songs and penning lyrics that are better than Hallmark greeting cards. Don't get me wrong. I love this album, but let's not get too carried away w/ praise for MJ. He's a wonderful dancer and a pretty good singer and that's IT. I mean he's only released FIVE albums since 1979! I'd love to hear some of your comments.Chris"
4,Good Jams,"This is the most soulful Michael Jackson album since the Jackson Five. Thriller was a bit overplayed in the eighties, but ""Human Nature"" and a few other songs on this CD are eternal. If you set the fame game aside and listen to this CD for its inherent musical qualities, it still makes it big."
5,Pure Genius,"Simply great, pure genius from beginning to end. I love it. The groove and the beginning of his legendary style are a comfort."
4,very good,"Quincy Jones's production is brilliant and inspired. Michael Jackson's and his sidemen's and guest stars's performances are exuberant. (The songs themselves are so-so--in my opinion--, but we can't have everything, can we?)Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
2,Thriller?,"I rememeber when Thriller first came out and every one was in it to it.I for one must say that some of the songs are good but as whole album it falls flat.If you want a great Michael Jackson album from start to finish I would highly recommend his best album period:Off THe Wall!!! Off The Wall was on the billboard hot 100 albun charts for like 8 years!!!! what does that tell you? Thriller was on there for maybe a year tops.Off The Wall sold 10 million records and 10 million tapes.I say download maybe PYT and Human Nature from I-Tunes.Thriller got old for me real quick and the songs get real tiresome.I real over rated album.Off the Wall on the other hand,every song is great from start to finish.The songs from Off THe Wall still hold up well today."
1,Draw your own conclusion,"""SACD"" stands for ""super audio CD"" and means that it likely will NOT play on your CD player UNLESS you've spent extra money for a special system. Amazon.com does not say anywhere what ""SACD"" stands for or what having an SACD actually means to you, the end-of-the-line user. If, on the other hand, amazon.com DOES inform you, the information is buried so obscurely in the website you'll likely NOT figure it out until after you have the product in your hands and it's too late to do anything about it."
5,Arguably the most thoroughly (and repeatedly) listenable album ever,"What more can be said about this album? Every song is worth hearing so many times that it's just nearly impossible to get tired of it. SEVEN of its 9 songs charted at number 10 or better, and even ""Baby Be Mine"" was getting a fair amount of airplay well over a year after the album was released. Personally, though, my favorite song from the album is ""PYT"" even though songs like ""Billie Jean"" and ""Beat It"" were more successful. Even if he comes to be regarded as the strangest person ever to walk the earth, this album should still be treated like royalty."
4,Terrific,"This album is really great, one of Michael best ones, but I don't like the new versions added at the end"
3,The memories of Thriller.,"I was 12 when the album made to Number 1 and 14 when the album fell off the charts. It was/is a good album. With the exception of Baby Be Mine, all the songs are great.(I don't think the album sold as many copies as it did because of it's greatness. It was advertised properly. A new song was taken from the album every two or three months and made into a single. Once that single became a hit, a new wave of listeners bought the single and/or the album. The promoters did this with 7 songs and stretched the popularity of the album for over two years. Sadly, other albums far better than Thriller since then have been neglected. Genesis' Invisible Touch is the one exception that comes to my mind, because it was promoted in a similar fashion.)If you buy any one Michael Jackson album, buy this one and maybe even Off The Wall. After that, I would recommend listening first, then decide whether it's worth buying."
3,Music great -- too much baloney at the end,"I used to walk to this Music when it was a tape. The music was as I remembered it, but I didn't like all the baloney comments which made up at least half of the CD. Even though the music was great, I would not buy this again or recommend it to anyone. I don't need to hear Quincy Jones or others talking -- I only want to hear Michael Jackson"
2,Original Album As Great As Ever/The Remixes Are Disappointing,"The original album conisting of the first 10 tracks still contain the great writing and production values of the past. Nonetheless, the remixes from songs 11 - 16 are not worthy of being included in such a great, historical project. I enjoyed the DVD with the music videos. It was particulary impressive because I was backstage and observed the Motown 25 Year Celebration and was standing close to Michael prior to his performance. Other than than, there is little else that advances the greatness of this historical album. I will still listen to the first ten titles and skip the balance of the album. Michael - what's up with this???????"
5,THE BEST!,"Mr.X if you don't like the album,please don't give any reviews,for ANY ALBUM,in future.JUST BEAT IT !"
1,Stick With The Original Thriller Release,"As THE biggest Michael Jackson/The Jacksons/Jackson 5 fan EVER I am disappointed at the treatment Akon, will.i.am, Fergie, and Kanye gave these classic songs. They took a million carat diamond and turned it into a cubic zirconia. Perfection never should have been messed with. Their visions for and performance of the songs just did not work...at all. The only bright spot to this 25th Anniversary edition is the inclusion of the unreleased track ""For All Time."" For true fans, please stick to the original copy of the World's Best Selling Album of All Time!!!!! This one is not worth your money."
3,not recieved,I have not recieved this order so I cannot give a review!I have previously sent amazon a message in this regard with no response.
5,Michael Jackson will be an all time great artist.,Michael Jackson will be an all time great artist. He was the king of pop & the king of videos. Great as a collectible
3,Michael Jackson's Thriller,"If you're a Michael Jackson fan there is a chance you already own the original Thriller album. If you are an ocasional fan (like me) this is a good opportunity to own a history making album in a nifty shiny cover. The extra material is a few bits of dialogue by Vincent Price (not very impresive) and a original unreleased song from that time (which is nice). The ""new version"" songs are not that good. Only one of them feels like a new take on the original song, the rest are basically remixes with no soul or feel to them whatsoever.From a collector point of view sure, buy it. From a fan that wishes to own the original Thriller sure, buy it. For somebody wanting to hear new takes on old MJ songs, not a good investment."
5,Three words:EXCELLENCE IMPROVED UPON!!,"Just when you think that the LEGENDARY album""Thriller""couldn't possibly be improved upon.....BAM!! It's done!! How?!? Simply put,two(QUALITY)bonus tracks,on it!! ""Carousel"" and""Someone In The Dark""really impressed me,""right off the bat""...Neither song,had to""wear""on me...I LOVED them BOTH,on the very FIRST listen!!The unreleased 2nd verse of ""Thriller""was a nice(hillarious)treat!! In fact,all of the""extras""on this album,were good!! The quality of the two unreleased songs are SO good,that I'm left contemplating:""What ELSE,has ""M.J""got hidden in the""vaults""?!? EXCELLENT ALBUM!!"
4,Great CD!,"Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of Michael Jackson who without question is the greatest performer of all time. The remastered and the new remixed versions are great. I do agree with other reviewers that the DVD should have been remastered particularly in high definition.The other issue I have with the DVD is that while the Motown performance was great I do not think it was all that. His greatest performance, for those old enough to remember, was at another award show where he sings I believe The Man in the Mirror. He starts out singing then is backed up by a full gospel choir. He gets so into the song that a man comes from off stage to check on Michael. It was so intense I remember being brought close to tears.When I saw it I wished then I recorded it; that to me was his greatest live performance because of the emotion and soul he put into singing it.Overall it is an excellent release and well worth the money."
2,"Origional songs are amazing, but remix additions RUIN the album","I LOVE Michael Jackson, but the additions to this album and the remixes are horrible. MJ never swears in his music, and the remix versions of his songs are filled with vulgar language. I am NOT a fan of Akon, Fergie, will.i.am, and most definitely NOT Kanye West. The only reason I chose to purchase this is because of the final track FOR ALL TIME. I am highly disappointed that such low-class selection of artists was chosen to remix his classic Thriller songs for a 25th anniversary edition album."
5,Michael Jackson is a Thriller,"In my opinion the greatest album ever made! Michael Jackson is a musical God with this album he truly has the world at his feet here. From ""Beat It"" to the greatest bass line ever w/ ""Billie Jean"", this album should be in everyone's album collection. It still remains the biggest selling album of all time 104+ million copies sold world-wide. Pure perfection! Michael Jackson is truly the King of Pop, Rock and Soul."
3,BEATLES ARE WAY BETTER THAN JACKSON,EVEN IN DEATH THE BEATLES HAD MORE CLASS THAN MJ EVER COULD JACKSON WAS JUST A PERFORMER THE BEATLES RULED JACKSON WAS MORE A WIMP IN MY EYES NO CLASS IF HE HAD CLASS HE WOULD HAVE LED A BETTER LIFE ALL I CAN SAY IS I HOPE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN COVER HIS BUTT AND THEIRS
3,A Good Pop Album!,"This album is pretty good. It contains a lot of good dance and pop music and many tracks on this album became classic such as Billie Jean, Beat It and many moore. The production is also good which is one of the key element to the albums sucess not to mention the style and mind of Michael Jackson which after this album suffered something that I don't know what is but i think it's serious. Though I Have said good things about Thriller many people may think it's weird that I gave it just three stars. Well the song The Girl Is Mine is not a very good song. That's the worst song on the album and there is some flaws with some of the songs on it. I also think that Thriller is a bit overrated I think it's no wonder it so so many copies but I Do not think it's deserve to be called a masterpiece because there is something on this album that is missing and I don't know what it is but I sure notice that when I have listened to it as a whole."
3,A TRAGIC MESS OF AN ALBUM,"""Thriller"" is an overly ambitious attempt by Michael Jackson to redefine Motown and R&B. The only problem is, the album lacks focus and the songs don't really fit together. Lyrically, the album couldn't be weaker, and the production sounds painfully dated when listened to today. Guest spots by Eddie Van Halen and Paul McCartney can't save this mess. There are a few classic tracks, but I can only say they're classic because they've been played over and over on radio and MTV for the past 17 years. An unremarkable album, and an overall boring set of songs. You'd do much better checking out U2's ""The Unforgettable Fire,"" which is truly a landmark of the 1980s."
4,we got it right,thanks for working to get me the record from my youth to share with my kids... it working great now!The webers
4,more fate please...,"well, i enjoyed it very much.the only thing wrong with it is that, like many OVAs, it feels a bit too short.20 somethin episodes never feel enough, and what suffers is the fight scenes. they always feel too short or downgraded or compressed. since its better to cut fight scenes short rather than story/substance. it, i guess, is something that should be expected in OVAs.thats all.good anime regardless."
4,A good read for a sunny day on the beach,Not the best Claudia Valentine story but one told with charm and some wit. Lots of atmosphere as Valentine pursues the case through Sydney's back streets.
2,Not great...,"This book does give some insight into temperment. I don't think it truly provides solutions to parents that will help them deal with difficult children. The author's approach is very behaviouristic and authoritarian. Most parents would find it hard to do some of the things Turecki suggests. He uses alot of negative labels for children's behaviour; he seems to be stigmatizing these children. It's a very simplistic approach. There are better methods available for helping parents cope with high energy children. I'd read Mary Sheedy Kurchinka's Raising Your Spirited Child and the follow-up to it, Kids, Parents and Power Struggles."
2,Difficult Child - waste of money,"Great description of difficult children.Sexist attitudes, no particularily good advice.Read Raising Your Spirited Child instead."
2,A Very Bad Experiment,"Harrad Collge is where students go to experience sexual freedom, have roommates of the opposite sex, have co-ed classes in naked yoga, etc., etc., etc. The best thing about the movie is the college campus where the action takes place. It is quite inviting and lovely. On the other hand, the acting is amateurish, the cinemaphotography leaves much to be desired, much of the dialogue will make you laugh-- the four letter words are bleeped out to protect the viewer-- for all the wrong reasons. At the end of the movie someone sings something about ""it is not over,"" but the credits rolled; and thank goodness, it was over.Nobody has a right to make such a bad movie."
3,"An Experiment In ""Questionble Taste""","This movie isn't great, but it's not that bad either. Made in the ""free love"" and sexual revolution of the 70's, the movie tries to explore the social ramifications of that school of thought. The acting and directing aren't bad, the dialogue is sometimes ludacris and at times very thoughtful. Buy this movie for an interesting look at the 70's (and lots of full frotal nudity--early pics of Don Johnson nude, pre Miami Vice)"
1,Former interesting film BUTCHERED for DVD release,"I remember this film as being a visual treat and especially sensual. I also remember a lot of FULL nudity...NONE of which survived the transfer to DVD. It is significantly shorter than the original release. Don't waste your time or money on this 'butcher"" job."

4,Good book,This was a very nice overview of Farmall tractors with lots of good pictures. My husband enjoyed reading it.
2,stopped reading it,"I saw this in my list of book to reviews and actually forgot I had it. I gave up on it after a while. It's really, really dry. I'm extremely interested in the topic, but not so much that I'm going to crack a textbook about it."
3,Dishwasher Safe?,The instructions included with this thermos state: Always wash the bottle by hand. Dishwashers can damage it.
2,Are these seconds?,Bought my 2 nissan's after the item said in stock and then received notice that it was 1 1/2 month delay. Actually had about 25 day delay. A bit surprising that they came in a plain white box and one had a noticiable ding in the cup. I don't think this happened in shipping based on the good packaging. The other I did not examine before giving as a Christmas gift. Happy enough that I didn't bother with a return.
4,Thermos Nissan 34 ounce,So far this is working very well. No problems. Simple design with not much to go wrong. I am satisfied and would buy it again.
2,yuck,"Ordered this awhile back. Was thrilled with it. Nice and sleek. No glass. Perfect. In the 90's yesterday and no air so wanted cold cold water. Stuck it in the fridge with just a little water. Took forever for that little bit of water to cool. Finally cool so added my other water already in the fridge. Perfect. Stayed cold. Marvelous. Drank the water in a couple of hours. Luckily I already put the second one in the fridge so it was ready. Put my cold water in it. Thought to myself, I'm going to want to know how much this holds so I better mark it. Turned the thermos upside down. LEAKED ALL OVER. Recapped it and same thing. Tried the first one, and it too leaked. Funny that 2 would leak. Left the one out and didn't stay cold for 24 hours as promised but stayed cold for only a couple of hours. Would not recommend this unless you won't tip it and will use the contents up within a couple of hours. So disappointed."
4,Thermos Nissan FBB1000 34-Ounce Stainless-Steel Vacuum Insulated Briefcase Bottle,"The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the documentation says it will hold its heat for 24 hours. It does not. I put 140 F water in and poured it out at the same time the following day. Water was nowhere near the temperature it was when it went in. I bought it for different reasons. It is for me to get my coffee to work on a motorcycle without getting it all over the insides my saddle bags - because spill proof cups are a MYTH! They don't exist! The thermos makes it to work without spilling a drop and retains the heat long enough for me to drink my coffee. I'd recommend buying it, it is reasonably priced. If they were a little more conservative on their claim of heat retention, say to something more accurate like 12 hours, I'd find no fault at all."
4,Oh yeah,This thing is awesome. It keeps things hot for a loooong time and it's just the right size. I wish it had a handle or hook or something though; it can roll around a bit.
2,False Description,"Bought this Thermos for it's function and form: 34oz. Thermos, slender enough to comfortably carry in my bag. The container, however, holds 34oz. when filled TO THE BRIM, making it impossible to seal without spilling the contents. Very disappointed."
4,Awesome thermos,"So I bought this thermos hoping my coffee would stay warm through a long day of studying. It seems well constructed, stainless steel so I'm not too worried about anything happening to it, or it getting dinged up if I chuck it out my window.I thought I would run a little experiment and test it out how long my coffee would stay warm. I brewed some coffee last night at 9pm, and it's 9am now and its still warm- it's not steaming too heavily but it's warm enough to drink, which is all I need.You have to make sure the screw on cap is on tight, and put the lid back on top. I forgot to put the lid back on top the other day and the coffee was cold after about 5/6 hours.Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the company claims 24hrs. While this has not been experimentally confirmed, I doubt it would stay warm that long. Still, it's good enough to serve my purpose!"
4,Great Thermos but BIG,"Keeps your coffee nice & hot! I took it to work one day and didn't get a chance to drink it, the same day my husband forgot his Stanley thermos on the counter. I got home and measured the temperature in both, mine was 145 degrees 10 hours later, his was 103.My only gripe with this thermos is the size. I thought I would like the 30-whatever ounce size because I usually drink a couple of good sized cups a day, but it turns out to be too much for me. I end up only filling it half way or dumping the leftover out when I get home. I wish I would have purchased the next smaller size, the 20-something size instead."
5,The best Thermos you can buy,"We use a large coffee press in the morning, which provides four cups of coffee. We share the first two and the rest goes into this Thermos.At lunchtime, I have hot coffee. Not cold, not warm, not tepid. HOT coffee! I used to buy my afternoon coffee but no more.The Nissan thermos is compact and light enough I can take it to work whether I'm driving or riding my bike.We were so pleased with this thermos we bought a second one a month later so that we can carry soup or another beverage on weekend trips.We paid $23 for the first thermos and received the second one 'free' as part of Amazon's 4-for-3 promotion."
5,I like this thermos,"Why I waited this long to buy a good thermos, who knows/ But the wait was almost worth it. This is one good thermos--keeps hot things hot easily 24 hours. What a difference between this and the cheapos you can buy elsewhere. BTW, it's very nice looking, so works well in the office. Sometimes I think I should have bought larger, or one with a handle, but all in all I'm very pleased."
4,Pretty Good but one caution,"I've had this thermos for about 3 years. Recently I noticed what I thought were coffee grounds in my 2nd cuppa. I at first presumed that the grounds were from the basket of the coffee maker, due to a paper filter leak. After this happening for every brewed pot and me checking for a collapsed paper filter and finding none, I can only presume that the black 'teflon-like' coating of the inside of this thermos is deteriorating and flaking. I do not scrub the inside of this thermos, just a rinse, so it's not like I've caused this unusual situation."
1,"BEWARE, Safety Issue - Choking hazard","I own 3 Thermos bottles (all different models) and this is by far the worst. The other 2 has lasted for 3+ years without issue. This one has a stopper that broke in just a very short time. There is a silicone/TPR seal at the bottom of the stopper, and a very thin piece of plastic supporting the silicone/TPR seal in place. As a result, a chunk of the support plastic has broken off. Worse, it broke off into 2 thin, sharp pointed pieces that ended up inside the Thermos. And when I ended up making a drink for my young toddler, these pieces went into his milk. He could have easily choked on them! Bad design!! Not fail safe.Called Thermos customer service and they offered to SELL me a replacement stopper. Will not buy another Thermos product. Bad customer service and no concern at all for consumer safety."
1,Cannot keep the water hot,"I bought the unit after reviewing the comments. Unfortunately, the thermos cannot keep the water hot at all. There was a temperature chart in the manual but the thermos did not even get close to the chart. After 12 hrs, the water is cold. It is not worth the money nor the trouble to get this one."
1,It Is Bad,"Take it from someone who listened to these songs everyday on the radio, this compilation is bad. Nothing is original."
2,traffic in body parts,"This would be a great doc for those who know nothing of the topic. However, if you've heard of trafficking in human organs, then this work on skims the surface.I really like Lisa Ling. What a pretty young lady! Still, it's hard for me to take her seriously after seeing her on ""The View."" At least her performance here wasn't as silly as in ""China's Lost Girls.""I hate when docs brush over issues of inequality and I applaud this doc for not doing that. The work emphasizes that rich individuals are benefiting from the body parts of the poor. Those in the First World are getting over on those in the Third.The work ends on a positive note, mentioning that microchips may be made in the future that can do what body parts can no longer do. They show a woman who is about to get a transplant and she could have been my aunt, grandmother, or other black lady down the street.If folk have given a lot of attention to ""blood diamonds,"" then they should really work to address this tragedy too."
5,did the job well,"I was looking for a sturdy catch to hold some weight and be precise. The pieces are of course rigid, there is not any wiggle room, so the alignment needs to be precise when screwing the pieces, but that is exactly what I was looking for. I am very satisfied with the result.By the way, be careful to order the right size as this was not very clear when ordering: there are different sizes, make sure to order the right one."
2,BS grade.,"Essentially a glossary. Repetitious, drawn-out, painful explanation of terms. Nothing serious, nothing in-depth. Sounds professional but hollow. The only strong point of this book is that it includes many, many terms; useful from a ""talk"" point of view, but useless from an ""applied"" point of view."
4,ask question,is there any twofish implementation in this books. I want to look for the implementation and i haven't got it yet
1,Farberware Travel Mug,I purchased this travel mug for use at work. I was disappointed that it did not keep my coffee hot for more than 1 hour. I also didn't realize that I could not re-heat in the microwave with it. It has a stainless steel band that prevents microwave use. I have had travel mugs that kept beverages hot much longer than this product. I wouldn't recommend it.
4,C'Mon Get Happy,I called the publisher on this book yesterday and was able to order it directly from them for 11.99 plus shipping. They guaranteed it within 2 weeks. The name of the publisher is Warner Books. The number is 1-800-759-0190. You just need your credit card ready. This is the only way to get it at this time. Even book stores could not guarantee delivery. Obviously they have decided to do another reprint.
4,"Blunt, Frank and Honest","Cassidy does not hold back in telling his story. Blunt, frank, and sometimes searingly honest, David tells all. Especially interesting was how he and his agent were tricked out of millions of dollars due to a misleading contract. I like the fact that Cassidy and his co-author wrote the book in his own voice. When you read it, it's like David is telling you his story, rather than having a sanitized version written in perfect prose by a ghost writer. It's a definite must-read for all Cassidy fans. My only criticism is that David wrote about his Partridge Family years in great detail, but glossed over his post-Partridge years. Hopefully he'll consider doing a fuller autobiography."
1,Wrong Item,this was a wrong item that was mailed to me.it was returned right away.I did receive my refund promptly.
2,Nice Hitch - Does not fit '74 Ford F100,"This is a really solid and well built receiver hitch that I would love to have on my truck. Only it doesn't fit, despite being indicated as such. If you have a 1974 full sized Ford, look somewhere else, otherwise this may be great for you. Five stars to Amazon and their no hassle returns."
4,Pool float,"These are great for being able to sit in the pool and talk with people. Not real durable for kids, but great for adults."
3,Product is great for the price but Shipping is a rip off,The product was a great value. I paid Gradys Hardware for UPS shipping expecting to get my order in a more expedient manner than the standard USPS mail. I think a blind Opossum could have gotten my order here faster than the 10 days it took .I could not track my order because no tracking # was offered . I wasn't sure I was going to get my order until the box was in my hand.
2,They all break. Every one.,"I bought 12 of these for our pool. In a month, all 12 were broken in the same place. They break where the seat attaches to the float. Very comfortable while they lasted. Intec should just build them better."
3,Nice Float,"This is a nice float.....I had purchased some from a chain discount store years ago and need to order more for friends. After searching the web, I finally found just what I was looking for on Amazon. So I order 12, some for friends and some for me. I didn't use mine as they were spares to the ones I already had, but my friends said one ripped at the seat right away. I warned the others I bought for, not to be rough with these as the quality isn't the same as my original ones. They are great floats is you take it easy with them and not jump on the seat. Not for small children, they don't fit in the seat as adults do."
2,broke in one hour,I bought 5 of these Sit N Float Lounges for a float trip. With in an hour all most all broke and we had to swim most of the way it was a 5 HOUR FLOAT.
1,Flimsy and poorly made,"I purchased the Sit N Float Lounge to go with the pool I bought for my husband's birthday. We blew it up, put it in the pool, and as soon as my husband went to sit in it, the seat completely detached from the arm rest! He does not exceed the weight limit (he weighs under 200lbs, and the limit is 250), and was not being rough with it. I would not recommend that anyone buy this. If we had been able to use it at least ONCE, I might have a different opinion. Spend your money elsewhere!"
3,"Colors may vary, be wary!","I know this says colors may vary, but beware, I got ALL pink ones, and I am pretty sure my husband is not going to use a pink floaty! If you are going to ship mostly pink then at least change the picture from blue to pink. I didn't expect to get all blue since it said colors may vary but I didn't think I would get all pink either!"
2,Fun While It Lasted.,"We got two of these from a friend to use in our pool. They were great, but after only using them 10-15 days they both ripped. the area between the seating area and the arm rest is weak and easily torn. Too bad."
1,great concept but doesnt last,"INTEX SIT AND FLOAT purchased 4 of them for my trip to aruba for the lazy river..one broke the second day. bought home the next two broke, down to one. the problem is the piece you place your legs on it breaks. tube is unless afer that. WE ARE ALL NORMAL weight..if your heavier i dont suggest this tub."
1,"Ordered 3 units, 2 units broke the first use!",I ordered three of these units despite the previous reviews. I was hoping I would get lucky but I did not. The seats of two of the units became unattached during the first use. The third unit still works fine and is a really good float. I hate to give such a bad review but I have no choice.
5,pool fload for adults,This pool float is the type I admired while visiting my daughter out of state. We love it and it is good for all adults.
2,Great float.....but not very durable. :(,"I was so excited to use this float when I received it...but, two days later the seat tore and it's no longer usable. :( There wasn't any rough-housing involved in it. In fact, I'm the only one who used it - just normal wear and tear by a 150 pound woman. I used it for probably a total of three hours (if that), so I'm very disappointed that it's torn up already. If it would've held up I'd definitely have given it a better rating because I did enjoy it for those few short hours,"
1,sit n float,"they were a lot of fun while they lasted, but that wasn't very long. one of them the seat ripped off and the other one blew up while my granddaughter was on it. it just split down the side. definitely would not waste the money on them again."
5,love it,I had one of these years ago and had a hard time finding one this year (they were all sold out in stores). This one was good price and everyone that gets in the pool loves it.
5,Super pool float,"Great pool float just for chilling out. The seat is very comfortable, and you can choose to sit higher up, or deeper in the water. The dual cupholders are a fantastic feature. Perfect for relaxing in the summer sun."
3,Comfortable,This was purchased as a replacement for same. The previous lounger was damaged by a negligent teenager. My wife's favorite lounger.
4,Bible School Prop,"I ordered this for a bible school prop. This year we were ""Going Deep"". (all underwater stuff) Anyway, the lady that got up in front of the kids wore the duck along with a snorkel and flippers and made a HUGE hit. The duck was a perfect touch, and everyone loved it. It actually ended up going home with the youngest child at VBS, and his smile was absolutely priceless. :D Good product, perfect prop."
2,"Comfy, but not made well . . .","Really comfortable -- I have had three -- one lasted a whole season, but the most recent two tore after three months. (And this was with normal use.) Not well made . . ."
4,Great floating chair!,"I really enjoy this blow up chair! It's just an inexpensive, not that durable raft, but for the price, you can't go wrong! It is very comfortable to sit on in the pool, and I love it!"
2,Ride very stiff,Returned for riding to hard and reboundy. Not better than OEM worse. Bought cheap Monroematic plus and rides normal now. Also had bought Gabriel Utra Truck shock and it was worse than sensatrac Go cheap and u will get the OEM ride you expect.
5,Great Photos,"The photography by Comstock is amazing, worth buying just for the beautiful clivia images."
4,Simple yet elegant,"My girls and I were looking for a pretty necklace for me to wear on Mother's Day that represented our family. We wanted something simple but elegant...nothing flashy. This one fit the bill. It is very simple, but also pretty. We all loved it very much. Our only complaint is that the picture makes the pendant look a little more 3D, when in actuality, the pendant is flatter in real life. It would have been nice to have seen more pictures of the pendant from different angles to represent it better. However, we kept the necklace and I have worn it since Mother's Day."
2,Not what I thought it would be,I had seen this necklace at a fair and unfortunately did not purchase it there. I was happy to see it available on Amazon. This one is smaller than I thought it would be and it is not made well. Cheap is the accurate word to describe it.
5,Beautiful!!!,I absolutely LOVE this necklace! I like that it's not the traditional baby's head hanging from your neck...never did like those. This is a contemporary art piece. I can't believe it's only $25! My only complaint is that I wish they would have offered it in white gold. So very pleased! This makes a great Mother's Day gift!=)
4,Rough Guide to Wales,Great book for sightseeing and understanding history. Would be a perfect book if a bit more info on dining and shopping was added.
3,Vic's Weakest Effort Still Worth a Listen,"Vic claims he recorded most of this album drunk, hence the title, and I believe it. It's a bit sloppy, a bit underdeveloped, but still a notch above most of the other singer-songwriters. Of course, I'm partial. ""Supernatural"", ""Gluefoot"", and ""Kick My Ass"" some of his best tunes. If you haven't heard him yet, check out ""West of Rome"" or ""The Salesman & Bernadette"" first. If you like Vic, chances are you already own this album, as well as your own opinion. 3 for Vic, 4 for the rest of the music world."
3,My review,"Worth the price of admission for tracks 5 & 6 alone. Not his best work, sounds like he may have been drunk."
3,it's ok,"My father bought this for my son when he turned one year old. I never used it rear facing but I found it easy to install forward facing and the latch system is easy to use. The infant head pad was really hard to get off but my son seemed to like it at first. We travel out of state with him alot and the padding has just not been enough to keep him comfortable. Also, the straps will not remain untwisted. These straps have twisted worse than any other car seat I have owned. And because they twist, it is hard to tighten them properly. Plus, twisted straps in an accident will leave your child bruised and ""belt burned"" if not causing even severer damage. I am seriously consindering buying a Britax for more padding and better safety. Maybe I would like it better as a booster since the straps aren't needed then but my son is way too small for that."
2,I was hoping for something darker.,"I like Leather Strip, and I don't think this album lacks in talent. However, I agree with the review below, this isn't a Leather Strip album. The music is verry popish, and in some ways it brings to mind the kind of music that they often play at gay bars. Gay disco/electro pop? Anyways, there are a few moments where I get the EBM vibe such as ""happy pills"", even less of the moments where I get the industrial or coldwave vibe, I mostly feel that this is is a pop album. I actually hate a few songs on this album to be quite honest. Yes, it is still dark, just not verry good. There are 2 Cd's on this album, and the production isn't terrible, and there are a handful of decent tracks. Overall, it's not a great buy, and certainly a dissapointing album for Leather Strip, considering taht Claus Larsen (LS frontman) is one of the pioneers of the terror ebm/hellectro scene. This is none of that, rather, more of a pop techno record."
4,Good,"Works great. had my Hv20, so it fights right into my camera without any issues..and it is from canon...so no doubt it wont work."
5,Fascinating Primary Sources on the French Colony in Florida,"This book contains the manuscripts of Rene Laudonniere describing French attempts to explore and colonize what are now Florida, Georgia and South Carolina in the 1560s. Edited and translated by Congressman Charles E. Bennett, ""Three Voyages"" covers the failed attempt to secure this region for France. Laudonniere was not the most memorable of writers but this book touches on Native American life, religious conflict and the various jockeying for position as Spain and France looked to secure this important part of the New World."
3,"good, not great - it's what Domino online help SHOULD be","This book provides the info that Lotus SHOULD have included in Domino Designer's online help. I feel like Lotus ripped me off, and this book adequately fills the void. However, I was hoping for more in-depth developer's info. Instead, it's more suited to the novice developer or advanced user, and is definitely not a comprehensive reference. If you're a beginner, you'll find this useful. If you're a more advanced developer, or an administrator, then look elsewhere."
5,An Underwater Adventure,"Trapped in an underwater city, David and company must try to find their way to the surface. But how can they when the only thing keeping them alive is the temperamental Roman god of the sea, Neptune. Neptune has them in his own little underwater world and the only way for them to stay alive there is for them to make Neptune happy. David doesn't know what to do and to add to his problems Merlin is there looking for Senna. The only thing David knows is that he can't let Merlin get Senna. Also back in the real world he meets that strange lady who told him to ""close the gateway"" and finds out who she really is. We get to understand David a lot better and see how he is willing to do anything to save Senna and be a hero. Understand the Unknown was a gook book but definitely not the best in the series. At the end we get another cliffhanger and are left to wonder what happens."
3,"Not the Best, but Okay","I started reading the book awhile ago and it wasn't as good as the other nine books, so I quit reading it. I just got it again and finally finished it. It was better then I thought it would be. The series is about five kids trapped in Everworld, a world of ancient gods and their domains. Each book is about a different place in Everworld. ""Understand the Unknown"" is about an underwater world with the god, Neptune. David, one of the five, narrated the story which is about the kids trying to get to the surface. I thought the book was 'just average' because there wasn't much adventure and it was hard to get into it. When I finally got into it, it was better. The series is great."
3,Okay at best,"I have read every single one of the Everworld books and this was the worst. I'm not saying it was bad, but I just got the feeling that the author just needed to add another number into the series and wasn't trying to develop the plot any more. The author introduced too many new characters and it kind of got overwhelming. Although I felt that Understand the Unknown didn't tie in as well with the other books in the series, it is still an important addition to the Everworld series and should not be passed up."
5,"Non-irritating, non drying, and a great value","I have been using this for years at night. (In the morning I use Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant.) The combination of these two seem to work for me and I have fewer blemishes now than ever. Other products that I have tried have been too irritating or drying. When I was younger I needed a cleanser that would reduce the oil but now I have skin that is getting dry, and yet I still have occasional blemishes. Finding a product that would not break out my skin but not strip it either was a challenge. The Purpose Cleanser is the closest I have come to meeting both objectives. I also like the fact that there is no scent."
2,too drying,dried out my skin - but i DO have really sensitive skin.i used this 3 times and binned it.
2,shorter than expected,"Only reaches halfway down to floor on my grill. Not impressed. After first year, already tears and wear."
5,loving this,I bought this for my canon 40d and the battery grip. It is comfy and not too big definitely gives me the confidence that the camera wont drop to the ground when I am out shooting. I hate the neck straps.
3,"Good tongs, but too slippery for my needs","These are good, sturdy tongs that work relatively well for my needs. The locking mechanism is smooth. The silicone coating holds up well to extreme heat, however the silicone covering is actually pretty slippery, and it makes it difficult to flip fish or other foods in the skillet. I ended up with sauce splattered on me each time I'd try to use the tongs for this purpose.Overall, a good pair of tongs . . . but I'm going to need to buy a pair that will allow me to grip things a little better."
1,Hard as a Wet Noodle,"I'll start by saying that I've listened to Rollins for about three years. The one reason I got into it was because his music and spoken word were hard and right in your face! Nothing but the opposite with this bomb, though. If you're looking for killer riffs, charging lyrics, and an overall intense sound, this is not it. Like a fine wine, Henry Rollins has gotten better with age. However, if you like his early stuff, you just might dig it."
3,"not for everyone, even Rollins fans","The first half of this CD, "" Hot Animal Machine,"" is mediocre. Rollins is certainly not at his best. I just wasn't captured by anything presented, neither the music nor the lyrics.Now, the second half, ""Drive By Shooting,"" is simply amazing. There's humor. There's stuff that just plain makes you uncomfortable. It's obvious that Rollins is having fun and experimenting; it works.I doubt too many people would enjoy this CD; however, I do recommend it. Just realize, it's really not like anything else performed by Rollins.This CD is a transition from Black Flag to the rest of his phenomenal career. Proceed with caution..."
4,CD,"good item thankyou. not yet listened to, will let you knpw if it is faulty or damaged. do not hold your breath!!!!"
3,Good read for fans of Donna Reed,"Not a typical Hollywood ""tell all"", this book is really geared towards fans of Donna Reed. Though very informational, the writing lacks professional polish that perhaps a more experienced biographer would've been able to use to spark it up a little."
5,Best panties ever!,"The stretchy material is snug without being tight, and the coverage is extremely flattering in front and in back. I love the way these look!!"
3,False advertising,"Pro: I love the way these fit my wife.Con: No choice to purchase the white ones with the black lining. They show you 4 choices, but you can only buy 3."
2,a little additional info would be nice,"The workout in this video seems good, but the video comes with no overview on the box, in the box or in the DVD as to how long it takes, whether you're supposed to do all the sections one after the other, including the workout with the weights, or whether you're supposed to choose a workout for the day or one that suits you best. There is no information as to what specifically the workout is designed to accomplish."
3,A little to racy,"This movie was ok, but a little too sexy for me. I wanted a horror movie that wasn't embarrassing to watch."
3,The Dentist,"You may just floss too much after seeing this or perhaps over-brush until the enamel comes off, After all what is more scarier than a Doctor's Visit? Hospital Visit?A Dentist Visit? Voting Democrat of course but we digress, a movie that before the gore galore of ""Saw"" Came along you had this little number while certainly not as brutal it lacks no sophistication(Classical music Anyone?)and it is downright creepy. Keep em' Clean."
4,IT'S TIME FOR YOUR CHECK UP!!!!!,"Corbin Bernsen stars as a wealthy dentist who begins losing his mind after catching his beautiful wife cheating on him with the swimming pool cleaner. He knows that if he divorces her, she'll take half of everything he has. His intense fear of losing it all causes him to lose his own mind. So, he begins taking out his frustrations on his unsuspecting patients. The result is a chilling bloodbath that'll make you think twice before going back to the dentist. This movie is definetly not for the easily offended. The scene in which Bernsen rapes a female patient is in bad taste. But gorehounds will not be disappointed! This movie would've been even better if the conclusion hadn't of fallen short. This movie is still cool though. If you got the 'nerves' to watch this, then get it. You'll like it."
2,Kind of boring for a 2 yr. old.,My 2 yr. old granddaughter liked it the first time she played with it but she hasn't touched it since. I think she might be a little too young for it.
2,Great Band - Poor Sound Quality,"I am a big fan of ELP but must admit that this DVD is a big dissappointment. If I compare it to other DVD concerts I own, especially those recorded in the Royal Albert Hall, the sound quality is frankly just poor. Gregg Lake's vocals, a trademark of ELP's sound, are not strong and very difficult to discern. The performance is okay, but again, without superior sound, it makes it difficult to sit through."
2,"Live ELP, marred by poor sound","On the one hand, here is a chance to see live ELP, including my personal fave, Pirates. It's too bad the sound is exceptionally poor (muddy and imbalanced), which ruins what would have been a great treat. It's just no fun watching this because the sound is so bad, and I am not an audiophile by any stretch of the imagination."
1,Poor product.,"I am very disappointed with this product. It does heat evenly, the waffles are soggy, and plastic pieces keep breaking off each time I use it. It is in the trash can as I write this."
2,Bakes perfect waffles but the handle breaks easily,We used this product twice with FABULOUS results!!! My family are big belgian waffle fans. We started telling everyone about how much we love this product. Then went to make waffles the other day and it no longer flips and won't close all the way. We had warrantied the product and they are sending us a replacement. The person at Villaware was very helpful but couldn't find this model in their system and it was only purchsed the end of March from Amazon. We are now gettting the round model on their website. I hope the new one doesn't break because they really do make very nice waffles.
2,Not What I Expected,"I ordered this microscope on-line because the Toys R Us store didn't carry it in stock. It is all plastic. I was very disappointed in the quality of the microscope itself. It does have several neat add-ons, but that didn't make up for the microscope. Also, the age range is a little off. I bought this for my 12 year old nephew, but I don't think he would be impressed at all -- and he loves science."
3,Not impressed.,"It seemed to help a bit, but I went back to using Mucinex liquid. I doubt I'll ever buy this again if other choices are available."
5,Fantastic!,"This book had me literally laughing out loud most of the way through. Tom Robbins is hilarious, zen, raunchy, touching, insane, and intellectual all at once. AND I LOVE IT."
5,"More fun than Diablo II. Grab a chair, read in one sitting.","I've heard a lot of scathing reviews, but to be honest you're either going to love the ... outta this or absolutely despise it. If you're a redhead, expect to love it. As usual, Robbins gives us a convoluted and twisted love story amongst other things...but let's face it: we crave his dead-on descriptions of deranged society--after all, they're not -that- far off. Fans of wit, buy it. Buy it now."
5,a classic,"I have to admit that when I first started reading ""Still Life with Woodpecker,"" I had my doubts about whether I'd stick it out. I was focusing too much on the absurdity of the premise, but then I gave myself over to it, or it took me over, I should say.I found myself totally absorbed in it. It's funny, heart-warming, callous, cynical, articulate, intelligent, painfully accurate at times, and always engaging. I couldn't put it down, and when I'd finished reading it, I was a bit sad that the journey was over. Robbins writing style is refreshing and his insights profound.The book struck a real chord in me, and even now, it still resonates. I will often go back to the ending and re-read it, and it never loses its potency. This is one of the best books I've ever read, and I can't recommend it enough."
1,What a stinker,Bits of story are sparsly intermingled with the author's apparent facination with menstration. I feel cheated to have spent money on this book.
4,A mystical fairytale with a spellbinding ending!,"This book started off a bit slow and uninteresting, but as it unwinded its magical tale, I grew increasingly hooked on it."
2,Random Insanity,"I loved Tom Robbins' Jitterbug Perfume, and expected to adore this novel. Instead, I found myself irritated by the thoughtless lust between an immature princess and a pretentious, repulsive bomber. The repeated interludes to describe the color of a typewritter - gosh, who cares? - added even more irrelevancy to the novel. The literary wordplay which so amused me in Jitterbug Perfume seemed both forced and foolish here. The whole book seemed to me more a rambling diary-entry containing everything that happened to flow into the writer's mind than a coherent novel."
3,"Worked,, but cracked after being in my wallet.","It is a great idea, but after a while in my wallet the plastic credit card size holder falls apart and the stick got damaged.I hope they improve this, as it is great to keep in you wallet so it is always there. The one in my wifes purse is fine - you don't sit on a purse."
2,Performance is spotty,Use of camera filters should not add noise to the picture. These do a poor job. You can see what appear to be evenly distributed circles or spots on the lense. What is that about? I cannot recommend the product.
3,Not nearly as awesome as the simpsons,I am a big matt groening fan so I bought this. One out of every 10 was funny and the others...
1,Good to read if you can't sleep.,"""The Gardens of Kyoto"" started out semi-promising, but went nowhere. The story, the characters, the writing were all dull.The only reason I got this book was because I was being rushed in the bookstore. I wish I had been given more time to look around since I'm sure I would have picked up something more interesting."
1,I really wanted this clock to work,"Why is it so hard to make good looking, functionally sound alarm clock? I agree with the previous review about the clicking noise. It also runs on batteries with no adapter, at least that is how it came when I had bought mine. Perhaps the digital ones are better, but honestly I felt these are really over priced for the quality of the product. It was all quite flimsy with jiggly noises coming from inside of it. It is ashame because I think it could be a really nice product if they did some redesign. hopefully someone else comes into the market with a better version."
3,"Informative, But Not Memorable","Period drama always catches my eye when looking for something to watch. I find them informative, intriguing, and a great way to learn a little bit of history that escapes my knowledge. Though my own grandfather served under Franz Joseph in the cavalry, I frankly haven't delved very much into Austrian history. Watching this period piece gave me a taste and an interesting peek into his empire and the life of the Crown Prince. His sad demise by his own hand and the tragedy of not being allowed to love was sad indeed. A reminder that duty of the royals didn't always equate to happiness and freedom in life. However, I must admit that beyond all the glitz of the costumes and location, I didn't find the series to be as notable or memorable as others I've watched regarding royal families of the past. I found it somewhat slow at times and admit to my sin of using the fast-forward function to get on with the story."
3,The White Masai DVD,"The movie worked fine, but one corner of the plastic case was broken, probably frpm the packaging it was shipped in"
2,save your money,"... and read the online documentation instead. The authors state that this handbook ""adds to the online help"". In a way that's correct. It may serve as a print out version of the online help if you are too lazy to click through the help desk. The latter, however, is for free."
3,How to survive marriage to a Russian woman,The books is too small. Author wrote about two yeas of his marriage. Two years is not enough to write a book. Frank Coleman in his TO RUSSIA FOR LOVE book provided more dating sites. Bill writes that his wife might write a book about her experiences with an American man. Loo late. Oksana Leslie already wrote her book HOW TO SURVIVE IN INTERNATIONAL MARRIAGE about her adjustment in USA during 6 years.
2,It's all right,"Well, it's a true story of one particular international relationship/marriage, and those are always helpful if you want to get a picture of what it's like. However, the book is not very detailed and poorly written. It will help in the process of educating oneself on the subject, but you will definitely need to read other books."
5,"A basic story, but acting and plot win the day","The story is pretty simple, we've seen it all before, but a great human element and excellent acting make this film.This movie was filmed in Seattle, in the apartment building I was living in at the time. My brother and I met Jeff Bridges and Edward Furlong, and got to see the filming (at least at that location). What an adventure that was for both of us! However, neither of us were extras in the film and we don't appear in the movie.Someday I'll set up a website with little known facts about this one. A DVD release would be nice, since it appears the movie is out of print and destined for obscurity. What a loss that would be."
1,Be forewarned....,"I ordered this DVD, and 2 out of 5 chapters wouldn't play on any of my DVD players or laptop. I returned it to Amazon, who promptly sent a replacement. The same problem exists with the new disc. I searched online and tons of people have the same problem. If you want this DVD, buy it from Gaiam---they've supposedly remastered it and fixed the problem. I called them today and they say they're sending a new (hopefully functioning) one out."
1,Worst dance tape I own!,This is by far the worst dance CD Ive seen and I own several. Trautman overtalks everything and makes all the moves much more difficult than they really are. Im a teacher myself with a degree in physical education and computers and have taken and taught many classes on teaching physical activities. This tape is very frustrating to watch and learn from. The only way you can get anything out of it is to watch it with the sound off so you dont have to hear the nonstop over complicated talk! I think hes trying to impress us with his chatter rather than teach dance. I have other tapes with the same moves and it takes 1/10 the time to learn the moves from them with no frustration and its actually fun! Gary in Texas.
1,can't think of a catchy title here,lets get one thing straight right away here. this is definitely not a suspense or a scary film. apparently its not intended to be either. pretty much one big rap video. just all about music for the most part. only check out if your a huge rap fan. otherwise you won't know what your getting into. ...
2,Disappointing,"My husband and I purchased this DVD right before we started our first cycle with the hopes that we would learn from couples actually going through the experience of IVF. Instead this was a very simplistic look at three couples going through a painful experience. It was depressing, not informative, nor helpful. Each couple appeared to have unique stories and yet there was no background information on their medical history, ie., what was their diagnosis, what cycle number they were on, etc. Additionally, no information was provided as to what additional procedures were conducted -PGD, ICSI?This was a DVD simply showing three couples going through an incredibly painful experience with little information to help the viewer. I imagine that anyone who is interested in purchasing this DVD is very familiar with the heartache of infertility and does need to watch other couples going through the same anguish. We wish we had never seen it - Too depressing with little helpful information."
5,Wow!,"This book is incredible! The characters are intriguing and the dialogue is some of the best I've read, regardless of genre. Lysistrata and Ram are two passionate lovers whose story tugs at the readers' heartstrings. Christine Monson weaves a tale of the East that allows the reader to experience Burma from their very own home. This is definitely tied for the very BEST romance novel ever written (along with ""The Windflower""). A definite reread."
5,Golden!,Erica Orloff launches the IT GIRLS series with a sure hand and a golden touch! Madison Taylor-Pruitt is a great heroine and the story of her coming into her own under extremely challenging circumstances was a read to savor.
4,Good book with slightly misleading title,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The final chapter, discussing the efforts of Pius XII, is a must for the bookshelf of any thinking person, and is itself worth the price of the book.Other myths, such as the ""Pope Joan"" story, are also handled well.Many of the chapters, however, are actually apologetic works outlining the Catholic position on the primacy of the Pope. These are well written, and should be of interest to readers of various backgrounds. Even if you don't find the case for papal primacy convincing, this book outlines the Catholic position in a clear and readable way.Highly recommended."
3,Wrong Listing!,"Mercy, Mercy! Who writes those blurbs? No Sousa and no Nagano composition gets performed at the Waldbühne 2000.The composers are: Bernstein, Ravel, Matsushiba, Zhao Jiping and Gershwin. The name of the composer of the second percussion piece is not clear on the DVD case, so I leave it off instead of erring.The three star rating is for the stunning performance by the percussionist Eitetsu Hayashi, superbly supported by the Berlin Philharmonic, in what must have been an interesting experience for all musicians."
4,Not too shabby!,"I've had this shower head for about a week and am generally quite pleased with it. It's surprisingly large -- literally about the size of a small football. Our water pressure is about average and this unit does a nice job of giving you a lot of coverage with sufficient pressure. I would describe it as a cross between a traditional shower head and one of those rain soaker types that flood you from above. The center stream is also a nice feature for rinsing and what not. The unit has a lot of plastic parts, but it seems to be sturdy enough. Teens or kids might be a little rough on it, but it's great for adults. For the price, it's a fine value. In fact, I'm about to order a second one for my wife, who is jealous of mine."
5,Waterpik replaced my broken one--great service,"I own four of these aquascapes for our family and my mom (who lives in a different home). After much testing of different shower heads from with sunflower, rain, immersive promises, this one provided the best shower power and feel.In trying to adjust one of our aquascapes, a plastic ball cracked, and water squirted out the side. I tried to find the receipt, but couldn't find it. Depressed, I called Waterpik, and they told me they'd send me another one to my address. She gave me an estimated shipment time and was courteous, professional, and helpful. I didn't even tell them I have multiple Waterpik products in our homes.I think this product is great. Despite the one crack we've experienced, I think it is more than well made enough. Yes, it's not made out of brass, but it's more than fine. And best of all, both Amazon and Waterpik stand behind their products with top notch service.I highly recommend this showerhead."
1,"Plastic crap, broke after 6 months","It performed great, shot thin laser beams of water at me (which I like), but the mounting is all plastic, and snapped broken after 6 months of being installed. Now I look like a wristcutter."
1,Slow,"Plan on getting in the shower 15 minutes earlier than before. I have to stick each stem of my body under the water sprinkles to get them wet and saturation takes a couple of minutes. It probably takes about 13 seconds to get my hair wet through; I have short hair. That may not sound like a long time, but count thirteen seconds off and see if that seems normal; keep in mind, it is only your hair receiving any water at this moment. And to rinse out soap takes longer. If you don't mind being damp in the shower, go ahead and get this, but if you want to actually get wet, don't."
4,"""Great Pressure, Could Look Better""","Great shower head! Lots of pressure and covers you totally. The only negative is that it is made of chrome covered plastic on just the front so you see the gray plastic on the back of it. Wish they made one of nicer materials, would be worth every penny since this shower head is incredible. Just to note, the flow limitor was missing on mine."
1,Did not receive the item shown!,"I thought I was buying this from Amazon, but only after purchasing it does it say the seller is NorAm International Partners, Inc. The product I received doesn't match the description at all. I received a shower head that looks used, was thrown in a box with zero packaging, and doesn't match any pictures online. Very disappointed."
1,What a disappointment,"I bought this thinking that it would be great. I have wanted a showerhead that had some power to it. I took my old showerhead off and installed this one. I turned the water on to test it, and boom...it was broken already. The plastic piece that changes the water flow had broken in half. Maybe if you get one that works, the showerhead is great. I never even had the chance. Very poorly constructed in my opinion."
4,AZ64,"I got this for my birthday to replace the original shower head in my home after using a rain style shower head in a hotel on vacation. This head is a great compromise between a true rain shower head and a traditional head. Even with the flow restrictor in place there is plenty of pressure for a strong rain style shower and the center part of the head gives a traditional type shower. This is not fancy, but it does what it claims well and I would recommend it for anyone. One final point. The head is large to look at, but the spray is very concentrated so it does not even spray water on the shower door like my old small head did."
3,"An ambitious, flawed shared-world project: 3.5 stars","..MEDEA was an an ambitious shared-world project based on a seminar Ellison taught at UCLA in 1975. I reread part of it in 2002. Niven's Flare Time is the standout story, one of his finest standalone shorts. The Silverberg and Poul Andeson stories were OK, and I barely rememember the other stories. Google for TOC, eg at Wikipedia.The introductory and world-building matter is alternately dull and pretentious, and there is a stunningly self-indulgent transcript of a panel discussion of the project that goes on and on and on -- it's like reading a 20-year old Usenet discussion: there's a certain queasy fascination at the start, but tedium quickly sets in. As usual, Niven's backstory essay is worth rereading. The others weren't.Happy reading--Peter D. Tillman"
4,"good book, solutions manual ??","this is a good book, but does anyone have a copy of the electronic solutions manual ? it is available on the springer website but my professor doesn't have access."
4,Strong graduate-level text,"While a bit dated (1990), it is nevertheless a comprehensive overview of organic synthesis suitable for upper-level undergraduates or graduate students in organic chemistry. Unlike reference works like March, it is more of a textbook - however, a good number of references (with few mistakes) are provided. Along with part ""A"" of the series and a more reference-oriented work such as March, it provides a solid foundation and entry point to the literature for advanced students of organic chemistry."
5,great custmer relations,awsome series the first shipped to me was stolen in transit all i recv.was an empty evlope so i called and amazon sent a replacement right away ups and im a truck driver and only have limited time at home but i received it in time to take with me on the road thanks amazon you will have my continued buisness paul wells.P.S.great great show
4,Worth your time,"It's a good show. You can't just watch the first episode to fall for the characters. You need to invest, but once you do, you'll be hooked."
2,DOUBLE DISKS,I gave this to someone for a present in another state and instead of discs 1 through 5 it had discs 1-4 and a double disc 4 so the person had to take it back to a store and change the entire season for discs 1 thorugh 5!!! Somebody should check the contents of the discs - I would definitely think twice about ordering tv shows through amazon again. It was so embarrasing and the person was very inconvenienced.
1,WARNING,"THE SHOW ISNT BAD, ITS TERRIBLE !!! (CANT STAND THE WAY HE WALKS). DISSAPPOINTING, THIS IS NO SOPRANOS, THE SHIELD OR BREAKING BAD OR ANYTHING. WHY PEOPLE LIKE IT I JUST CANT UNDERSTAND."
5,Best show ever!!!,"I happened to catch an episode of Sons of Anarchy on FX one night while channel surfing with my husband. It was from season two, and got me so intrigued I ordered season one. It sucked us in from the first episode and we spent an entire weekend watching every episode of the show. The characters are well developed and suck you in from the beginning. When I heard Katie Segal (peg from Married With Children) I was skeptical as to how she would pull it off. She is BRILLIANT!!! She is incredibly believable and although she is harsh you can't help but love her and cheer her on, illegal activities and all. This is a show that essentially gets you rooting for ""the bad guys"" and loving every minute of it. Don't be surprised if you have the urge to go buy a Harley and hit the open road. This is now our favorite show by far and we eagerly await season 4."
3,Gritty-good.,"When 1st season was on TV, I was watching another series at that time slot. Glad I got to catch up on the back story to the episodes I've watched."
4,Great fun,"I'll keep this short, Sons of Anarchy is a terrifically entertaining show.That fact that I'm saying this surprises me a whole lot to be honest.When I first heard of SoA and its premise, I couldn't help but find it a bit laughable.Now however, that sounds way too cynical, because I've been proven wrong. And I'm very glad I have!Whether it is a club-internal dissension, keeping the authorities off their backs or competing with rival motorcycle clubs,SoA has always something interesting in store.Sons of Anarchy is certainly worth to have a look at, I don't think you'll be disappointed."
2,"Just glorifies dirtbags, plus poor dialog.....","I could see you liking this if you're a Harley dirt-bag (real or imagined)for it's over charged machismo that the lowest common denominator tends to worship. The reality is this is a show with poor dialog, mediocre acting and worst of all it glorifies the idiot bully mentality that is at the heart of a cycle ""gang"". These guys should be hung from the highest tree for pure a-holeness, not glorified. It's just too hard to like any of these characters, why would you? Would you want any of these morons as a friend or neighbor? I hardly think so. If you like a criminal show, watch a well written well acted series like ""Breaking Bad""."
5,"Probley the best ""Shaksperian"" show out there",On the surface this show is a great drama with great comedy moments. But the fun starts after you get to know the characters and the story. A very strong sense of Shakespeare's Hamlet. Can't wait to see how season 2 is going to play out.
5,Great show!,"This show is great, especially if you're a fan of tv shows like The Sopranos. Having said that, be aware of what you're getting into--there is swearing, but, much like The Sopranos, the characters are so fascinating that you don't care about the vulgarity. If anything, it makes it seem more realistic. This show has given me a completely different perspective on things I had never thought a lot about. I especially love that a woman--the character Gemma--is playing a leading role when crime dramas typically only showing men as part of the action. The part is played wonderfully, and to be honest I don't have any idea what the one-star reviewer is talking about. Give it a chance and watch the first episode because it will probably hook you in. If you can't stand swearing, vulgarity, and violence, go watch everybody loves raymond."
5,Love Sons of Anarchy Season 1!,Love the Season one Sons of Anarchy 4 disc set. Quick shipping and on time delivery. Great to watch this series with no commercials!
5,Sons Of Anarchy Season One,"If you like this series, it's a must have and if you have not seen it yet you need too. It's only series since the Soprano's that I whould actualy buy."
4,Good S,"I got into this series late, so I decided to start catching up now. This is a pretty good start!"
5,Great show!,"Product arrived damage-free and intact. My sister loved her Christmas gift. If you're new to the show, this is a good start. You'll get hooked."
5,:),Look if you need a review to convince you to buy SOA your an idiot. Buy it already. Have a good weekend.
5,Outlaw life,"Bought this because I have watched the show early on but not from the beginning so I wanted to start from the first one so I can see how the story goes. I am not disappointed so far, only makes me want to be on my bike even more. Too bad its January and I live in the north. Oh well, come on summer please."
4,great experience,Had no problems wirh my order receive it timely matter. Yhe price was reasonable. Didn't have to check on order. Received earlier than expected
4,Cool SciFi Manga,"its a very interesting read. i first came across the anime at blockbuster sitting on the shelf in the rental section. they didnt have it to buy so i made a mental note to do so. then i came across the manga at a book store and was extatic.anyways, i havent seen the anime so i wouldnt know better to compare. but all in all its a great storyline. the chapter interlud pages have a funny little scketches, and whats even more cool, is that ADV didnt remove all of the kanji(japanese letters) so sometimes, anthing not in a bubble, and sound effects theres still the japanese writing. plus its in the classic-manga form (right to left)even if you HAVE seen the anime, its worth the read."
4,Only Book I Used to Pass!,I used this book and the boson.com sample tests as my study guides. I comfortably passed the CISSP exam. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because the questions at the end of the chapters are too easy compared to actual test questions.
1,Slim on information,"I have been studying several books for the CISSP exam and this is the first study guide I have purchased and read. I was very disappointed in the amount of information in this book when the actual exam covers so much material.I feel I have a more extensive understanding of the subjects from my months of studying many other books - I was hoping this book would take me even further, but it did not."
1,This movie is not as advertised!,"This is supposed to be a fun, qwirky, cute childrens movie, but it's anything but! After just under halfway through this movie, my child was horrified and I took it out. It's like someone got drunk and thought it might be cute to make an animated version of"
4,Good Entertaining Movie!,This is a good movie and very entertaining and very funny! My kids enjoyed it although thought it was a little scary.
2,Good Movie But Terrible DVD Release,"I love this movie the only problem is the widescreen. Its horrible, there is more black bars then movie and I have a 52"" tv and the movie was still to small to see. The should have released it in either fullscreen or normal widerscreen."
4,Clever take on an interesting topic,"We were looking for something different for family movie night and found it in ParaNorman. We enjoyed this movie (sons 7yo, 9yo, hubby, and me) and were surprised at how fun it was. This might be too scary for younger kids, though, there are some scenes that can be frightening. There are some places where it lagged, overall though, it was cute with an interesting theme."
4,Love the convenience,Movie wasnt as good as I had expected it to be. It was worth watching once. Loved the convenience of it being here.
1,Horrible Movie,Horrible movie. I regret my wasted time. It's not a family friendly movie. Do not buy. Save your money and buy something else!
3,ok,"it was an ok movie, a little too spooky for young kids at the beginning, especially if they dont like the dead coming back to life."
2,It didn't hold our attention,We decided to view this video before buying it. It is not worth buying to us. We view many animated movies and buy for ourselves or one of our families. We feel this video would not hold the interest of any child we know.
1,Awful. Very disappointing,"Awful movie. Poor dialogues, somewhat nice 3d effects but in general, it's not for an enjoyable family time. I expected more from the creators of Coraline, a movie a truly love. I think this movie exposes my kids to the real world in a wrong way. For the first time ever, I regret the purchase of a 3d movie."
4,ParaNorman,"Great animation and a very good storyline. While I didn't enjoy as much as some others I've seen, it was well done and entertaining. I would definitely recommend to a friend."
1,"HOLLYWOOD PROPAGANDA, NOT FOR KIDS!!!!","Simply DO NOT buy this movie for your kid. There is swearing and so many adult themes I couldn't mention them all. Also, Hollywood has decided that THEY are going to raise your kids. They will say when and what your kids know about swearing, violence and sexuality. They force their values down your throat and you won't even know it until you have bought the movie. Don't buy this movie, avoid it at all costs."
3,"Good Movie, bad connection","The movie itself was good, however if you have a somewhat shotty internet connection, like I had it can take forever. But the movie itself was entirely cute."
2,"Disappointing, missed opportunity","The story is quite dark and preachy, as it turns out, very morbid, quite sad. Not fun. Can't say more without spoilers, but it was not what I expected, and not fun.The movie could have been much better. For example, the movie could have been a kid bullied for his misunderstood special gift of talking to the dead, then town gets terrorized by brain eating zombies (mocking zombie films here), then kid saves the day using his special gift to talk to the zombies and convince them to happily live beside the living, town prospers with tourism to see the zombies. That's actually what I expected from this film, a zombie comedy, and was disappointed that it wasn't at all that.It's all fine, I suppose, if you go into this movie expecting it to be sad, morbid, dark, and preachy, but that's not what I expected, and I wouldn't have bought it if I had known."
2,Excellent animation. Too silly script,"The animation is excellent, although there was no need to make most of the characters so ugly looking and grotesque. The plot is too silly and slim. It would have been fine on a short movie, but it is clear that it had to be stretched too much to fill a full-length feature (a common defect of too many movies). It is essentially a tale of the redemption of all the inhabitants of a small town. the problem is that their conversion from stupid and nasty to smart and nice is poorly done. It only happens in the last five minutes of the movie and it felt too rushed, forced and unbelievable. Most of the characters are too stereotypical, which is disappointing."
2,Hard to get through...,"Unfortunately, I tried to watch this twice and fell asleep both times. I have to say, the trailer made this movie look much more appealing."
5,good move kids liked it funny happy,it was a good move. i want to watch it agian so do my kids. I think we all raedy watched 6 times.
4,"We Liked it. Great for our 10 year old boy, Watchable for us.",Nothing spectacular in the story. We rented it to watch on a Friday night and it held our interest until the end. Our 10 year old son was interested.
3,Great Stop-Motion...,"not so great storytelling. While visually ParaNorman was a fantastic movie, it just liked the ""fun"" or ""excitement"" of other movies such as Coraline. The story set up and parallels between Norman and the witch is truly heart felt, however what the movie had in animation chops it lost in entertainment value."
3,Ho Hum,I like animated movie. I enjoy the art work and craftsmanship that goes into making these kinds of film. This one fell a little below the level of great. Norman's looks could have been made more sympathetic. Story line was predictable. At the end of the film the screaming blasts made by the little girl witch was to provide 'shock and awe' but after a while I was saying enough already. The conclusion dragged on too much for me....
2,This is one of my favorite books,"But there is not a copywrite page or anything official looking. There are so many editing mistakes, words misspelled and not capitalized properally. I gave it as a gift because it is one of my favorite books, but I am embarrassed that I gave such a terrible reproduction."
3,great game in the larger size,"I bought this game elsewhere and enjoyed it so much that I purchased it for my son and his wife. However, when it arrived, I was surprised to see that this one is much smaller than the one I purchased elsewhere and not quite as nicely made.This game is very easy to play, but still provides challenge and fun for adults. I play it often with my grown daughter or my mother, however I can play it with my 10 year old grandson too. The box it comes in is wooden and I leave the game out for display. If you live in a dry climate you could actually leave it out on your ""front porch"" table to play while sipping a tall glass of lemonade. I would reccomend the larger version."
5,Civil War Researcher's Dream,"An excellent book to purchase whether you are an advanced Civil War researcher or a novice. I found that the book's reviews are on the mark in ranking websites that present solid information clearly, and are relatively easy to navigate as well.Using Civil War on the Web, I discovered exceptional websites that I would have overlooked otherwise, sifting through hundreds upon hundreds of hits. I very highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know where the best information is without spending hours on the search alone."
1,"bummed, now not so much.","The pen worked OK the first time but even stored in the upright position I have been unable to get it to work the second time. This is the second pen and it didn't work any better than the first.Looked up papermate and found Sanfordcorp.com. Decided to send them an Email to see if they knew how to unstick the pen. Got a reply in less than 2 hrs asking if I wanted a replacement, to mail the pens back so they could find what was wrong and an offer to pay for shipping. Or if I still had the receipt, a refund. Pretty darn prompt for any business nowdays. I'm impressed."
3,Great Resource,"I have used this book for a couple of years now sort of as my ""Bible"" on raising my slider turtles, thanks to it I was able to sucessfully raise a hatchling & make upgrades to my setup to meet the needs of 3 growing turtles. It covers a broad spectrum of just about everything you need to know from housing to feeding to breeding. This is just a great book!!"
1,Accurate info but not much of it,"The information in this book is all accurate. The author clearly knows what he is talking about. Unfortunatley there isn't much detail about certain aspects of owning a red-eared slider such as how much to feed it, issues of egg binding, behavior, how they process sensory input (vision and smell)etc. I was actually able to find more information on certain websites after doing a Google search. Not worth the money."
2,Cumbersome to use,"This map is HUGE and I would not be able to recommend it as your in-car navigational tool. I'm trying to use it to plan a driving vacation in Scotland. The tourist attractions are not particularly well marked. For example, the mark for a castle or historic house is a VERY small black outlined rectangle with no other color to it. Archaeological and historical sites don't seem to be listed at all.I'm using the map, guide books, and the internet to find the required information. It is too late for me, but if your purpose in buying this map is the same as mine, I would keep looking for a map geared for the tourist."
2,Bit of disappointment,"Amazon claims there is a version of Risk included in this package, too, but there isn't. Also, the casino disk included in this package is not compatible with Windows 2000. The other disk is a sort of SimCity but more complex and less entertaining. The classic board game part is fun, but you have to turn off the annoying voices and dizzying 3D camera movements."
4,8 bottle wine cooler,"Perfect size, works well in small spaces. Wine is kept at the perfect temperature. Easy to set tempature, and interior light is a plus."
3,"Good general reference, but lacks specific-year information.","This is a good, inexpensive general reference for those who need to familiarize themselves with the vehicles in this series and who need general information. There are some generalizations, areas which lack detail and errors due to the wide variation in models during the years covered. Expect this manual to provide general information on major systems and general procedures; don't expect detailed diagrams and specific locations of small parts. The scope of the book over many years and models prevents a high degree of specificity."
3,Vic's weakest effort,"I have all Vic's albums and I disagree with everyone else who has posted here. I find this to be his weakest effort (but its still good music). If I had to chose one Vic CD, I'd recommend ""Is the Actor Happy?"""
2,Pricey Pencil Sharpener,"Price brought me to this straight edge. In these uncertain times I am trying to ween myself off of the supermarkets that depend on cheep oil. Sure disposable blades are easy to get and use now, but what about in a market crash when store shelves are empty? Well in that event, I have a nice wittling tool to wish I was shaving. Yeah, when you buy this straight edge it simply doesn't shave. I have not given up hope. I am going for the strap and sharpening stone to see if I can give this an edge. As of right now it does pencils fairly good."
3,Mean pocket knife w/ razor blade,"Solid pocket knife for defense, intimidation or box cutting. Rather large, nice feel in hand, made in China. Pretty heavy. Definitely not for shaving!"
2,Inexpensive...and dull.,"I had high hopes that this straight razor would put my disposable blade razor to shame. I knew it was inexpensive and assumed it would require frequent sharpening, but still, I thought about the shave you get at a barbershop. All those thoughts vanished after my first attempted use. The blade is dull and the razor is unable to remove even some of the hair. If you're going to buy a straight razor, I'd suggest you get something better than this one."
5,A comic tragedy,"As a person who has suffered some difficult losses, I can emphasize with the character. His addiction seems rather silly but don't most? Philip Seymor Hoffman perfectly encarnates Wilson Joel who can't seem to recover from his wife's shocking suicide.This is a great film because we really want to know what will happen to this fine man who is being destroyed by his own demons. How will he get a new life and with whom will he share it? As we see his encounters with other characters in the story, we are always wondering if he will connect with someone. I won't give away the ending but what is important is the excellent acting all around and the fine direction.Great film for mature audiences who are prepared for the subject matter."
1,Another yawn fest to avoid,"I have to ask the question what was the point? This film simply goes nowhere; for around ninety minutes we see this guy sniffing gas, yelling a lot and acting just plain weird. No one that I've known has ever committed suicide but I'm sure there are better ways to portray grief then this mess. I kept drifting in and out of sleep because I couldn't give a damn about the main character. I can't believe it won an award; I guess their is no accounting for bad taste. Down the toilet for this one!"
2,Good if your baby has 24 inch arms.....,"I bought this for my 6 month old daughter who loves light up toys. We were really disappointed with this toy. All the little activities are great, but she can't reach them! If you place this toy over here and position her feet against the kick pads, the toys dangle above her waist. She desperately tries to reach for the toys but they are nowhere within reach. What we do is turn the toy around and place it so the kick pads are behind her head. Then she can play with the dangling toys and spin wheel."
3,Baby Gym,"My baby really likes the baby gym. She likes to kick her feet a lot. She is occupied by all of the music and lights. My only issue with the toy is that it was missing a part (red toy) and and there was not an English manual with it. I bought it over a month ago and the part and manual have not been replaced yet. In that aspect, I am not happy with Chicco. However, the experience with Amazon was great."
3,It Works Ok,"This product did get rid of some of the algae but it didn't leave the water ""crystal clear"" as stated on the package."
3,another good algebra text,"This text is designed for beginning graduate students. The book includes all the basic parts of algebra any mathematician should know. The presentation and proofs are clear and easy to follow. People with no prior exposure to abstract algebra might have problems learning algebra from this book as quite a few important theorems and results are left with no proof. Instructor can easily supplement those missing proofs if he/she thinks that's appropriate. Overall, it's an excellent reference book for researchers, but only a good textbook for students."
1,A shame it's a repeat. I was looking forward to new stuff.,"The original printing, (1993) I believe, rates a 9.5 but it's very unfortunate that the publisher puts a new cover on old material. When I saw this book I was stunned. I thought 'Wow a new adventure'. After the first 5 pages it was 'Wait! I've read this before'. I would really love to see a new book with these characters."
2,It's a REPRINT!!!,"I bought this book thinking, ""Goodie! Another wonderful urban fantasy!"" So, I read it and realized it was simply a reprint of pre-published materiel under a new name. Be warned, faithful Misty fans, things arn't always as they seem!"
4,Satisfactory,"I wanted one watch to be usefull by the day even by night, in casual moments and in special moment. This one is complete for me"
3,Where are the new songs?,"I am a bit let down by this album. This is their third release, and yet they still include songs that have appeared on both of their previous EPs. This wouldn't even be a big deal if they were different versions, but with the exception of The Exit Poll, Amen (which sounds like they did some reworking since it's last appearance) are the exact same versions. There are only 4 of the 11 songs on this album that have not been released before. Only one song from their first 7 song EP is not here. I feel like they have ripped off the fans that they know will buy their music. I'm not trying to be bitter or a jerk, I just think they should have taken more time and released more new songs, rather than recycling old recordings."
3,"Hmmm not bad, but not great.","I bought this just a while ago, found it okay but not the big production show I was expecting. The opening was great but once that was done, that was it.The songs were all okay, and yeah I knew them all. The crowd seemed, by the post/pre concert footage, to love him, but weren't really into the concert. My interpretation of it anyway.And could he take off his sunglasses???He seems a nice and talented guy, but this is no big stadium ELO show."
3,Great performance but....,"Where are...Bev Bevan?Kelly Groucutt?Mik Kaminski?Melvyn Gayle?Hugh McDowell?Yes Jeff Lynne wrote all these songs, but that doesn't mean he should throw the name around willy nilly without considering that many of the fans want to see the real deal. I am certain that if they had gotten the complete ""Out Of The Blue"" lineup together and promoted it as such,this tour would have been a top seller. Don't get me wrong, this concert is great, and Richard Tandy does give it a bit more ofa feeling of authenticity....but hopefully Jeff Lynne will learn from this and the real ELO can come back with a vengance!"
4,One for the fans,"It was just great to see them again.Jeff Lynne is in fine voice and seems to be enjoying himself again which I gather he wasn't towards the end.The co-singer (Rosie is it?) is gorgeous and a great singer and the string section looks great.I liked some of the new songs and generally this DVD contains a good smattering of their back catalogue. 3 glaring ommisions I guess are 'So Fine', 'Rockaria' and ' Last train to London.'I can highly recommend this.If you are a fan you will enjoy."
5,ELO - Zoom Tour Live,"This is one of those ""holy cow I forgot this guy wrote so many great songs"" DVDs. Excellently shot and thouroughly enjoyable beginning to end. I have about 25 concert DVDs and this is the first one that had no sections that I wanted to skip. At the end the ""spaceship"" closes up over the band as Jeff Lynne states ""we're off to another new world""! Awesome."
1,Poor production in DTS,"This is the poorest DVD concert in my collection. The production gives the impression that it is boot-legged. The video and audio, especially in DTS, is as poor as it gets.I can't understand how the producers let this one through. The quality of the Eagles ""Hell Freezes Over"" is the model of a good production.I've read other reviews which contradict mine. Anyone else agree with me?"
4,Electric light Orchestra (ELO) - Zoom Tour Live,"Although this concert is in a small concert setting, The quality of sound and video is very good. They play one hit after another, and you will know all the songs,which makes it fun. His voice sounds just as good as it always has and the instumentals are perfect.His voice is still so unique and they are played and sung very professionally. We enjoyed this dvd. In fact, we watched it two nights in a row."
3,My Dinner With Umgar,"This is a really strange one. Umgar is an old man who wants to be left alone. But when unscrupulous parties want to kick him off of his land, Umgar strikes back.Umgar has been using his land as a resort (that's a laugh but it gets more characters into the story).Well, Umgar discovers that if people eat his worms they turn into worm people. Umgar sets out to put worms in the food of the bad guys (like sprinkling them on hot dogs).Eventually worm people from the lake (unintentional victims) seek either women worm people or revenge on Umgar.This is a wacky one that makes you wonder how people could not know they are chewing up worms. If seeing people with worms hanging out of their mouths is not for you, you should skip this one.This film also boasts one of the silliest theme songs around (yup, sillier than the one from The Blob)."
5,Makes sense of the Bible,"I first read this book as a young adult 20 years ago. This book has been one of the most influential book in helping me understand the Bible.Many of the customs that we think of as taking place ""back in the Bible days"" are still practiced. (The most recent example in the irate journalist throwing his shoe at former President George W. Bush is just one example). When I first heard the news, I immediately understood the impact of this action and its ancient meaning, thanks to understanding gained from this book.This is not a scholarly tome but written by someone who lived among the people and not apart from them. After reading this book you will realize that the woman speaking to Jesus at the well was not a whore."
5,Searching for years too!,"I was delighted to find these books again. For years I have been searching for the books about the little black cat, Jenny.Recently, I was at Books of Wonder and was jokingly testing the salesperson's knowledge. She knew! I couldn't believe it.These books were a pleasure to me as a child and spurred my love of reading. I intend to buy all of them for my daughter."
5,Lost Treasure Found,"Just for fun, I tried searching for one of my favorite childhood books about Jenny the black cat and her birthday party. How amazed I was to actually find it after 50 years! Now my granddaughter and I will enjoy reading it together!"
3,"Teen ""Shock Rock""","When I first heard about Christina, it was how hot she was. Now they're trying to classify this teen pop as shock rock. While it doesn't come close to Manson or Alice Cooper, nor even King Diamomnd, ten years after its release it's hard to believe a full decade has gone by already, but it still doesn't sound dated. I think it's o.k. if used to push it on her sex appeal, but shock rock?"
3,Better the Britney at least,"This album is not a classic, but then again, hardly any popular teen pop music is. For what it's worth, it is a very good acheivement for Christina, and it ranks as one of the best pop performances of the year. Keep in my mind that I am not biased against any groups; I gave Britney Spears'es album 2 stars, so 3 is a solid record. Among the highlights include the beat-driven ""Genie in a Bottle"", the cheerful ""What a Girl Wants"", the slow song-at-parties-for-the-weeks-to-come track, ""I Turn to You"", and the light dance song ""So Emotional"". The rest of the album is consistent, with the exception of the awful subject of ""When You Put Your Hands on Me"", but not enough to keep me from tapping the rewind button. Overall, this is an album worth being proud of, and should definitely pave the way for Christina for future success. Bottom line: if you are choosing between Britney and Christina, go for the latter option. You will not be AS dissappointed."
4,christina Aguiera - CD,"I think that the CD put out by Christina was a good one, but she hadn't really exposed us to any of the music on it so it was a choice made only by the one song GENIE IN A BOTTLE that got most people to buy it! She needed to market her songs a bit more to give her fans knowledge of what they were about to buy. Otherwise it was a good CD, and I hope everyone enjoy's it!"
2,VERY BORING SONGS!!,"Ok, fist off let me tell u that christina has a very good voice, but her songs are very very very boring...gosh i practially feel asleep listening to ""Somebody's somebody"" and ""Love for all seasons"" what a corny song. If she's even thinks she's going to be the next Mariah Carey or Britney Spears she's gonna have to start sellin LOTS more.... The only good songs on this album are ""Geanie in a bottle"", ""I turn to you"" and ""come on over baby"".Probably the WORST songs on this album are ""Somebody's somebody"", ""what a girl wants"" (thats such an annoying song) and ""love for all seasons""the other songs on the album are better but still not good. The only song i've heard that i LOVE by christina is ""Lady Marmalade"" with Mya, Pink and Lil Kim. This album is a waste of money."
2,erm... Genie is 4 stars!,"In some of the reviws, u lot say that CA didn't write Genie, but I just wanted to say that CA did write the hook in Genie, or so she says...I haven't got the album, but I do have Genie, which I like a lot, but it won't be remembered in say, 5 years. If I bought the album, I'd probably give it 2 stars because it has loads of ballads on, which I'm not fond of... although Savage Garden is 4 stars! What can I say, I have a thing for Daz! Neway, there are quite a few up/mid-tempo songs on there...WHAT AM I DOING?? I'M SUPPOSED TO BE REVIEWING CA'S ALBUM!! Sorry about that!"
4,Christina can sing!,"This is a good debut. It has a some great song and some not so great. The one thing you can't deny is that this girl has some pipes. But sometimes she over does it and it can get a little annoying.There are some really good song on this album including the #1 singles ""Genie..."", ""What A Girl Wants"", and ""Come oN Over Baby"". It also has some great ballads like ""Reflections"" and ""Obvious"".The album also has less steller tracks that IMO are just not good like ""Somebody's Somebody"", ""When You Put Your Hands On Me"", and ""So Emotional"". But overall it's a really good debut.I can't wait to see where her music goes in the next couple of years."
2,Its Ok but i've heard better...............,"This album doesn't reflect christina's true talents. Yeah, she has the voice which is shown in the slow ballad ""I turn to you"" but ""what a girl wants"" and ""genie in a bottle"" is lacking in some places. The rest of the album isn't constructed well (in other words they are not shouting ""CHART HITS!"") and i dont think any of the songs would reach top 20 especially since ""i turn to you"" just got to number 19. All around i would say that she has the voice for slow songs but cannot hit the spot with the up-tempo songs (even though she trys!) Buy this album for the ballads and try "" I WANNA BE WITH YOU"" album by Mandy Moore and ""OOPS.....I DID IT AGAIN"" album by Britney Spears."
4,A Very Enjoyable Album,"1.Genie In A Bottle-Nice song with a cool beat.10/102.What a Girl Wants-A nice smooth song with some R&B;/pop.10/103.I Turn To You-A very good ballad,amazing voice.10/104.So Emotional-Nice song,but after a while I get sick of it.8/105.Come On Over-Pretty good song,although the video version is much better.9/106.Reflection-One of my personal favorites. Beuatiful song.10/107.Love For All Seasons-Simple song, but it is very Britneyish.9/108.Somebody's Somebody-Just an ok song. I usually skip it.7/109.When you put your hands on me-Nice song but I get sick of it after a while too.10.Blessed-Good song,catchy lyrics.9/1011.Love Will Find A Way-Another one of my personal favorites.10/1012.Obvious-Not that good.6/10"
3,Great voice doesn't mean great album,"Not quite up to par on her debut album as fellow teen sensation Britney Spears, there is no doubt Christina Aguilera has one of the most emotion-laden, belty, and amazing chops in the business. She deserves every Grammy she's been awarded in her brief but colorful career, except for the one for this album. Sure, there're some pretty good songs, but Best Artist? Puhleez! Britney had been out longer and had sold more albums, and the category is for who has sold the most records basically. Laden with the typical teen pop mish-mash backed by an irresistible starting song, Christina's Christina Aguilera displays her outstanding vocal melodies, but she's lost in comparison to arch-rival Britney by the other material covered on this disc. Good but not great."
5,She has a great voice!,"Christina sounds a lot like Mariah Carey, so if you like her music, you will love Christina!! The songs are also fantastic and well worth the money!"
4,This Cd is pretty cool,"Christina's cd is pretty good. When I first got it I didn't like it as much as I thought I would but it sort of grew on me. She has such a strong voice for how young she is. I like the songs ""Genie in a bottle"", ""Emotional"", ""Blessed"" and ""Reflection"" (Reflection is from the disney movie Mulan.) Christina is really awesome."
4,Great voice.,"I bought this album simply because I enjoyed ""Genie In A Bottle"". After I listened to the whole album, I was very surprised that her singing voice is almost identical to Mariah Carey's. Christina Aguilera should have a bright future in the music industry."
3,Close but no cigar,"Sorry Christina but you ain't no Britney Spears, and your debut definitely isn't close to hers either. Everybody knows you can sing but Christina Aguilera (the album) isn't nearly as addictive as Brit's."
2,Who is Christina Aguilera?,"While she has an excellent voice, and a great smile, I have to say that this album just does not meet the standards. Her voice is a servant to the song writers, and this comes across very strongly because the album lacks depth and style. Songs like 'I turn to You' are very Mariah Carey, and come across as cheesy starters. The album does however, possess two good songs such as 'Genie in a Bottle', and 'What a Girl Wants'. Nonetheless, Aguilera lovers should come to terms with the fact that their love for her CD is a love for Christina rather than her music. This album may touch the hearts of many fans, but perhaps they are not really seeing the true value of music created here."
4,buy this cd,"I really thought that Christina Aguilera's Cd would be really bad. It, however, turned out to be a very pleasurable listening experience. My favorite song on the Cd is ""Reflections"", which was the theme song from ""Mulan""."
4,Christina Aguilera is fabulous!,"I am a fan of both Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears, and I have to say that Christina is better than Britney. Britney has tons of makeup and had a nasal, girlish voice. Christina has more of a natural beauty and has a voice that reminds one of Whitney or Celine. ""I Turn To You"" is the best song, while the worst is ""When You Put Your Hands On Me"" (and hence only four stars). ""Reflection"" is awesome."
4,A Great CD!!!,"C.A. is a wonderful artist!! I absolutly love Genie in a Bottle!! I really love this CD!!! So buy it!! And for all of you who think Britney does a better job,Wake up!!!"
4,"Not terrible, but not great","I mean nine out of twelve tracks sounds like a good deal. But she doesn't really put that much emotion into her songs. But really, what can be expected when someone else writes your songs? They'll get old after a while (like Britney Spears) but like I said before, you can't put your soul into something you didn't make.By the way, I Turn To You (third track) is the exact same one All-4-One sings in the Space Jam CD"
5,"I love it, I love it, I love it","This is a great CD. I love every single song on it. I also love songs she has on other CDs not on this one. I love all her songs. I love Christina Aguilera. If you buy this CD, you will too."
4,great C.D,This C.D is really good! I really like all the songs i reccomend it to people who like pop music!
4,Christina is here to STAY!!,"Whether you like it or not...CA is a voice that we will be hearing for years to come. The talent is obvious but some of the songs are poorly written...nevertheless CA sings those chords with the likes of Jordan Hill, Whitney and Mariah. And yeah she's better than Brittany...CA has the voice Brittany relies on the beat of her music"
1,Waste christmas present,"Why would friend buy this for me? I would much rather a Sophie Ellis Bextor cd. This voice is ok but GRINDING and too forceful.There is not one good song on this cd. Awful in fact. If I am to judge American music by this I am clearly not impressed.If she is to be succeeding in my books, GET A GOOD SONGWRITER. NOT POP!"
4,Better than Britney,"(...)I'll always be rather inclined to think of Christina as more talented, from her more emotional and soaring vocals on such ballads as ""I Turn to You"" and ""Reflection,"" to the Top Ten-ready pop hits ""Genie in a Bottle"" and ""What A Girl Wants."" Whereas more people are more likely to know Christina from her infamous ""Lady Marmalade"" hit single with Lil' Kim, Mya and Pink released last spring, one listen to this album will tell you that Christina's strong and powerful vocals are a worthy entry into the 21st Century pop music scene. BTW, my faves from this album are ""I Turn To You,"" ""Reflection,"" ""Love For All Seasons"" and ""Come On Over (All I Want Is You).""?!!?!Why the MMC, Christina? Why so fucking young???You're only 18...so of course, you've got potential--which is EXACTLY why I gave you two stars instead of one. I still love you and your music--but DAMN--the Mickey Mouse Club??!!!"
3,concerned about finish,"The brass mailbox arrived with splashes of green patina, apparently from having been exposed to a spray of water, which has me concerned about what will happen when the mailbox is partially exposed to weather and water spray (from shaken umbrellas etc) on a covered porch. Questions and photos sent to the company via Amazon have not been responded to after several weeks."
4,2006 Chevy Silverado Ext Cab Z71,"This product looks good. Installation was about 45 minutes. The frame bolts (as many have said) were too small. Had to use the original bolts. Not a big problem, but I had to find bigger washers to fit them. Overall good product, and it adds that little extra, looks wise, you might be looking for. I really like that these westin bars have the center bracket as well for support. Most step bars, I believe only bracket on in 2 places instead of 3. Recommend this product."
5,Helped me on my trip,"Having had a long and often boring road trip recently, my cd's were my great comfort. But did'nt want to worry about retreiving them while driving. This Case Logic visor helped with that greatly. I would pre-program the ones I wanted to hear in order, then could retreive or discard them with ease. Never felt distracted, and stayed a safe driver."
1,NOT worth the price,These bottles are just ok. They are not worth the high price. I would NOT buy this again.
4,"His later career, from influences to rivalries","Any college-level student of architecture should know the name of American architect Ralph Adams Cram - and any familiar with his work should consider RALPH ADAMS CRAM: ARCHITECT'S FOUR QUESTS a definitive work covering his life and achievements. His later career is the focus, following the prior acclaimed study of his earlier years in BOSTON BOHEMIA, 1881-1900: his most important commissions, his rivalry with partner Goodhue, and his leading influences from Roosevelt to Adams and Ayn Rand are surveyed, bringing all this together under themes which divides his career into four lifelong 'quests': medieval, modernist, American and ecumenical."
1,"""keaton's cop"" is more like keystone cops","don't let this one fool you it is rated ""r"" and not for the kids but the script must have been written for the kids because this movie is a mess of loose plot holes bad acting and poor action. the cast looks tired and sorry to be in this turkey."
2,"Not organized, not current.","If you are looking for the latest and greatest in a long series of banking industry troubles with Mexico's drug cartels, then avoid this book. The book is divided into two parts, one focuses on mostly events of the 1980's and Mexico drug trafficking and secondly, the other discusses banking regulation and money laundering. Although the book dicussess in depth many of the problems associated with the criminalization of drug laws and concludes legalization may be the best route to take away the profits from the illict drug trade; the book ironically, endorses draconian banking regulation as a means to ferret out drug proceeds. Clearly, the book was written durning two differnt periods and thrown together hapazardly. The section on the Mexican cartels and money laundering do not mesh well. Avoid this book."
2,Confused,"Well, after reading all the other reviews, I feel like an idiot. I have spent many hours trying to read this book and haven't made much progress. This book is not good for a beginner, and it requires knowledge of many other fields before the equations and applications make sense. I don't think it's fair to say that a beginner can pick this book up and understand the subject well. That person needs to have a good background in optics, quantum, and EM at least."
4,Already reading it a second time,"Great introductory book on keeping the Sabbath. Just as in her book ""Fasting,"" Lynne M. Baab mixes a lot of scripture with a lot of testimonies, leaving you yearning to try out the Sabbath for yourself."
4,Metal to the Core!,"I was completely overwhelmed when I heard this ablum. I was just discovering Gojira for the first time and I was stunned. This is some of the most Heavy and Original Metal I've heard in a while, and they mix a lot of elements of metal such as Death and heavy. My only complaint is about the intermissions of whales singing and stuff, when they could have been playing more great songs! lol Highlights on this album would have to be ""the heaviest matter of the universe"", ""From the sky"", and ""mars to sirius"". The reason I gave it a 4 is cuz some songs can get repetative at times, but its something i got over quickly."
3,does not fit all,This is a very nice looking case and has lots of pockets however it does not hold the Apex portable DVD player.
3,"Useful, But...","First of all, these are well made and mostly well designed with places for pens and mesh panels so you can see where the insurance card and registration are located. My only problem is that they're designed to hold a lot more than I intend to keep in them so the Velcro hooks on the strap don't match the loop material on the case unless you keep the case very loose. If the hook half ran further down the strap it could be closed more securely.Nevertheless, I may order more for family."
4,A convenient accessory,If your car didn't come with one of these from the dealership its a great thing to have to keep your glovebox organized.
2,"tried it, don't like it",Sorry to say this purchase of 2 years ago wasn't worth it. I tried it and it just didn't meet my needs.
3,Wish it was a bit wider,"Overall, this is a good product to help keep the glove box tidy. It seems a bit too narrow though. It won't hold standard envelopes."
3,Texport Montego Bay Hammock,"My old Wallyworld backpacker's hammock finally died after three years exposed to the elements, and the Montego Bay hammock seemed like a good deal. Unfortunately, it isn't nearly as wide as portrayed in the graphic. It's really too narrow to be comfortable. I'm not a large person. I wear a woman's size ten, and there is very little hammock left on either side of me."
2,already falling apart,"it is slowly falling apart and unraveling, just remember that with somethings you get what you pay for and that is the case with this"
1,Steer clear of this barrier,"Does not work as claimed in the product advertising, i.e., it does not fit all vehicles as it claims it can."
1,Wrong Cable,I own a Canon ES50 8mm Video Camcorder which is a monaural not a stereo setup. I looked in the instruction manual for the camera and on pages 6-21-50 it states that this camera takes a C-250 AV Cable. When I saw this cable advertised at Amazon as C-250 AV Cable I thought that's it. I read the reviews and it seemed to me that there was a problem with the picture so I ordered it. When I recieved the Cable it had tree RCA plugs instead of two. I know this is confusing but I wish someone will make a few changes to thier adv. [...]
4,Very good,Perfect for girls like me that don't really wear colored nail polish. Only negative is that it chips kind of easily and needs to be reapplied.
1,"i have not received this book yet - november 8, 2012","I have not received this book yet - november 8, 2012. I am waiting for. I'm trying but I can not contact"
2,Pass This One By,"Yes, this is out of print, and quite frankly, not worth your time. There are about 5 good tracks here; everything by Dr. Ring Ding, Barrett Yall's Ride is pretty funny and a good track, Cumba Del Sol by Let's Go Bowling is probably the best track on the CD, even though its in Spanish. Every thing else is uninspired and some of it is downright awful. ThE song by Ocean sounds like it is off-key (or they didn't tune correctly). The NY Ska Emsemble would be just a run of the mill smooth jazz band, except they added a ska beat, which, with them, doesn't add much. Run Away by the Slackers is a song that celebrates being a coward - ugh! The Skunks are dull, and the Toasters don't deserve to be recorded, they sound like phonies, and at their best, they sound like a bar band. So save your money, and search out Dr. Ring Dings out of print CD's."
4,Great Starter Book,"This book has some great information in it. I would recommend this book to others. The only reason I gave it four stars is because ultimately I am lazy and probably won't end up following any of the ""recipes"" she provides. Not to mention that the bath recipes could end up plugging my pipes! Aviva does have some great resources in the back of the book to buy products though...a bonus for me! If anything now I know what herbs to look for in already made products."
2,"This is the last time I'll buy ""refurbished""","This vacuum doesn't suck. It worked okay for awhile, but soon lost suction and now is the equivalent to a 20 lb dustbuster, but too unwieldy to use like a dustbuster so, overall, it's pretty much useless. I did so much research before buying a vacuum, but then got sucked in to the loooow refurbished price. Don't fall for it!"
1,Stinky!,"After only a few uses with a new bag, smelly odors blow out the HEPA filter compartment. The filter's clean & doesn't smell, the bag's not full. We don't have pet or other carpet odor issues, so we can't figure it out. Only remedy is to change the bag, so we go through them way too quickly. Also, the switch for bare floors no longer works. I'm very disppointed in this product."
4,On Time,Received item most quickly...Christmas present...less then one week...seems to be working as it should. Would do business with them again.
4,Outstanding Product,"Item orderd was the product I desired, however when shipped was a mixed batch of the order submitted. Aside from everything it will work what do animals know? More than we think, but they didn' place the order. Only disappointment was the high cost of shipping if shipped USPS the item ships for the same price up to 70 lbs."
4,A VERY GOOD READ,"I couldn't put the book down. The book was deep and moving. I felt like I knew the characters in this book and that I had gone through situations like Miquel. The book grabed me emotionally and didn't let go. Overall, the book had a good flow. There were some minor spots where I wished for expansion on a character's emotion to get more understanding of their thoughts and/or feelings, but these spots were rare. I'm looking forward to picking up the next book. Kudos to the author, M.W. Moore and the editor for a great piece of workmanship."
1,Broke Within A Few Weeks,"This footstool looks nice but is poorly designed. As the first reviewer noted, the key suppport point is weak and will easily break. I took care not to place undue weight on the footstool but it still broke after very little use. I also own the Ultra WFS22 Wood Classic Guitar Foot Rest (also sold by Amazon.com) and, in my opinion, it is a much better value for the money."
4,Allways pleased with Casio,I have allways been pleased with Casio watches. I prefer them over other digital watches. This one is a really great watch at a great price. The functions are plentiful and it looks nice as a casual watch.
3,Good starter,"If you don't have any programming knowledge then this is a great book to start with. However if you are an experienced programmer trying to learn assembly then you may find this book annoying in certain parts.The book does not actually go into assembly langauge until you get past a good number of chapters.This may be a good or bad thing depending on the way the reader likes to learn.Personally I think teaching pc architecture before going into assembly langauge is a good thing but I also believe the author could have saved a lot of space and still got the pc achitecture tutorial through.The book also covers 3 assemblers MASM,TASM and NASM but sticks with NASM for the most part. It also covers 32 bit assembly in Linux only.Overall, this is a good book to learn the basics of assembly language but be prepared to spend money on more books e.g ""revolutionary assembly language"" and ""inner loops"" if you want to be a good assembly language programmer."
5,Excellent Beginner Assembly Language Book,"I found this book to be very good and although I am using FreeDos 1.0 it is accurate all the way. As Free Dos is a clone of MSDOS you get all thebenefits from the book, like being able to access video memory directly, use the BIOS and DOS interrupts, and learn how to program in Assembly Language. Check out FreeDos <dot> org if you are a DOS fan.I recommend this book for beginning Assembly Language programmers."
5,Sauce pan a daily necessity,"Since receiving this 3 quart sauce pan, it has been used almost daily. Have two other smaller ones, but this one is the best size. Adds to our collection -- and use -- of 14 other infinite circulon pieces on our induction range top."
5,High tech for less,"Just received the 3 qt saucepan and couldn't wait to use it. Construction and finish are very nice. This is a heavy weight saucepan. After cleaning it I boiled some water in it and I was amazed. Watching water boil can be boring in any other pot. I was able to observe the even heating at the bottom, and also noticed how quickly the side walls heated as well. Even heating, no hot spots, priced lower than the competition. I'll probably buy the 1.5 qt saucepan as well. Highly recommended."
2,be cautious,"There is nothing wrong with the quality but unless you've worn these before I would beware. They offer minimal protection, very thin and lightweight. If that's what you are looking for you would like them. If you want a bit more padding then you will be disappointed. The one size fits all is also a problem, it doesn't. Larger men or men with large quads will find these too tight. thing is, volleyball players tend to have bigger thighs."
4,Basic book for German Poetry,"This book has good German poems in it with their English translation close at hand. It is a great introduction to German poetry and poets, not to mention a great vocabulary builder. It is a helpful tool on the road to learning a new language."
1,Terrible!!,"Dry and tasteless, extremely disappointed. Maybe I just got an old batch, but I ordered four different flavors, and they were all hard as rocks."
4,Good book for Christians,"Great book for Christians, not for others. I passed my copy on to a Jehovah's Witness who liked it a lot."
5,Exceptional little book,Excellent purse size book can travel anywhere. Good Read to promote a possitive attitude. Great small gift for the graduate! Brand new as stated and arrived in a timely manner.
5,I have bought 4 of these books!,"This book is truly packed with so much helpful information. Don't let the size of the book fool you. Although it is pocket size, it is jampacked with so many lessons for all to lead their life by. I often refer to this book when lost or confused. I just can't seem to keep a copy for myself!"
2,Doesn't work with RAW,"I used this with a 3G 20GB iPod. It was fine for shooting jpeg. Nice previews. Kind of miraculous for the price. The problem is that I now shoot RAW. The files will still transfer to the ipod. There is no preview but you can see a placeholder icon for each image. The problem is that when I transfer the files to my Mac all of the EXIF info is lost! The file numbers are still there, but no date, time or exposure information.Also, the connector will not work with the iPhone."
3,Not really sure..,"what to make of this book. Very good story, but hard to follow at times. Not the ending I thought it would be. A wonderful read all in all!"
1,The Emperor has no Clothes,"Let me be frank. ""Love"" is a very poor book masquerading as literature. Its structure is poor. Its meaning is virtually indecipherable. Yet, from reading reviews in general, it should be very apparent that I just don't get it or, perhaps, the wider community is afraid to declare that the emperor has no clothes.As ""Love"" is a slim volume of some 200 pages, it is simple for the reader to form his or her own opinions. Please go ahead! But do not say that I haven't provided fair warning. If I never hear of this book ever again, it will be too soon!"
3,"Bitterly, bitterly ironic","Morrison is one of my favorite writers and I have taught her work before in college. She is not one to hold back a punch, and her work forces readers to stare much of the horrifying ugliness of humanity in the face. I respect that. But I have qualms with Morrison's new novel. The book is certainly masterfully written, and there is no doubt whatsoever that Morrison is a genius. Without giving away details, Morrison plays on familiar themes here, but the social and artistic necessity of facing ugly truth (as in ""Beloved,"" for example) is missing. The ugliness feels like something I as reader should be merely entertained by, and that's the most disturbing thing about it. This is one of the bitterest, ugliest novels I've read in some time. Take all of this as a high recommendation or a low one. That depends on you. Just be prepared."
1,Just a bad math book!,"I teach Middle School Pre-Algebra and One Year Algebra. Every summer I try and purchase books and magazines in order to find new and interesting lesson plans. I purchased this book thinking I could get at least something new and interesting to excite my kids. This book definitely didnt help. College students would be bored with the books writing style and exercises. And most of the ideas are old and rejected from years past.Hand-outs and book assignments are not inspiring. A book titled ""Math Games"" should be just that; a book full of math games. Not one with mundane hand-outs."
3,Fills half of the gap!,"This book is essentially about profits, politics, and patronage in Malaysia. Indeed it is a useful detailed study on 'political economy in action' rather than the political economy of Malaysia. Those looking for a survey of previous studies on the political economy in Malaysia shall be disappointed."
3,"The best there is, which isn't saying much","Frankly, this is one of the worst-written books I have read in a long time. The author assumes that we know eastern european history, and has a style that can best be described as opaque. In spite of that, Kirschbaum has written the only extant history of slovakia that I have found, and does communicate the history, albeit in an elliptic and difficult prose style. If you are interested in Slovak history, this is a reasonable survey if you can slog through the prose."
5,Just like new,The book was almost brand new and saved me almost $100 off the price the bookstore from my college was going to charge me.
2,Embarrassing,"Although I've valued Dave Marsh's musical taste and criticism over the years, this book is an embarrassing suckup to Bruce. Marsh criticizes Springsteen's fans for resisting elements of Born in the USA and its accompanying hoopla, but never fairly addresses the possibility that they may be correct in assessing the album's failures. Other reviewers are right that in Marsh's mind, Springsteen can do no wrong, both musically and personally. The low point of this book for me was his fawning over not only Dancing in the Dark (one of my most depressing moments as a Springsteen fan was the disappointment I felt when the long awaited new single turned out to be this synth-driven throwaway), but the dance remixes of the Born in the USA singles. Yuck! Even more frustrating is the fact that Marsh never questions the judgment of Jon Landau as he pushes the reluctant Springsteen towards superstardom. It was clear to me the compromises Bruce made to gain such popularity."
3,OK series and good seller (atthemoviesco),"Similar series to ""Gantz"" made by the same creators. Some things are lost in translation especially the characters breaking into song (a la Disney). This is very odd for a horror themed show. The intro and ending don't seem to fit with the serious theme of the show. Also, I need to include here that atthemoviesco sent the product on time and in new condition since Amazon took my ability to leave seller feedback a day too early. So, positive feedback for them."
1,Could Not Finish Watching,"I purchased this anime years ago on a whim. The first few episodes were not bad but soon it took a nose dive. It turned into nothing more than the girls crying and whining every episode. This would have been fine if it happened during only one episode. However, it continued for several. It quickly became tiresome and annoying to the point that I could not even finish the series. It is rare for me not to even complete a series or a movie I begin. Though, on this one I could not finish it."
5,What can I say?,"Talent,talent,talent....About time someone came out with something with something good and refreshing....thank you Anastacia...muah kisses..."
2,Not the best one ...,"I bought this book reading the good reviews and with hope that I will get the needed knowledge about Spring framework. Although in some modules (IOC, AOP) the book is quite good and explains well the concepts, it lacks the concrete examples. The method used to explain the most complicated concepts makes them hard to understand without any other source of information.I found a lot of unnecessary information while the book lacks the necessary explanations sometimes."
5,"A really useful book, essential product development reading","If your product isn't geared to the customer, how do you expect to sell it?If you don't know how to design to customer specs, how do you start? And...is the customer ALWAYS right? Maybe you have to be one step ahead of them and surprise, delight and challenge them.You will find the answers to these questions and some very helpful processes in ""Customer-centric Product Definition."" And it doesn't matter if you are designing a cake pan, a high-tech gadget or a chemical product, the principles all apply.There is a very helpful chapter on establishing metrics, because if you can't measure it, you don't know about it. Other chapters make the case for customer-centric design and list techniques such as customer visits (with structure to get what you need), internal processes and much, much more.A must-read."
5,The best cymbal I own,"Among my three favorite cymbals - a circa late 60s 22"" Avedis ride and 20"" Avedis sizzle - this one stands out as my absolute favorite.It has a slight wash from the three-rivet cluster, and the same warm, rich overtones as my 22"" ride, but also can produce a relatively high definition ping when playing fast tempo jazz. Although I rarely play rock, this cymbal would make an excellent second ride for texture for drummers who play that genre.As a jazz cymbal this one has the sound, slight sustain, and subtle overtone that would make it an ideal primary ride cymbal."
5,One to treasure,"Oh-my-gosh, a fine gay themed movie made by real filmmakers - what a change! This excellent and touching film is well written and directed and is perfectly cast. The interpersonal relationships are funny, intriguing and convincing. Full marks."
4,Good movie... Sticks to the book almost perfectly!,When you read Boy Culture you have a set image of how it goes...Boy Culture: A NovelThis book sticks to the plot and really takes it to a sexy level with the cast. Its witty and sexy and a good read and movie!
1,Interesting film on cable,"Could'nt review on DVD,Sorry to say I had to return this disc after purchasing / exchanging twice & returning for a refund due to malfunction disc from the manufacturer & pressing plant for this disc. They need to improve their quality control at their distribution plan . Thanks Amazon for resolving my issue about the malfunctioning disc they sent."
4,"Well scripted, spot-on casting","For a script with a rather serious love theme,the title somehow lacked the steam to do it proper justice. That is, by no means, a criticism of this well scripted and superbly cast depiction of gay subculture. A brilliant cast led by Patrick Bauchau and Derek Magyar, who both gave spot-on portrayals of an ageing closeted queer living in fear and a hustler with romance issues, respectively, lent an air of respectability to this indie although the title just could have, in my view, been a tad less flippant.That small shortcoming notwithstanding, I'd still highly recommend it."
1,Dobry is a QUACKPOT !,He is very simply not playing with a full deck.He thinks everyone is out to get him.Classic Mental Illness.
1,not the real bands,I bought this cd at walmart. there was no indication on the cd that the songs were not sung by the original bands. I tried to return this cd at walmart and they wouldnt take it back. basically if you want a collection of worship music done by the original bands and singers. Dont buy this cd.
1,Not Spirit-Filled; not 'various artists',"I just purchased all three - yellow, pink (or red) and blue ... THEY ARE ALL THE SAME. Mostly one guy, and sometimes a girl ... they both sound alike: CHASING after Christ, absolutely NO SPIRIT-filled music. DO NOT BUY THIS. ... BTW - This is the very first time I've not been happy with Amazon's description. - the description is FALSE."
5,Really comfy shoes,I ordered these for my brother in law who is diabetic and has lots of problems with shoes. These are exactly what he needed!
5,Worked beautifully,"Had a local shop install it. So far, no issues at all. They make less noise than the factory ones."
5,Dormen great product,dormen products are supper fast to install.easy install. great product. works as good or better then OEM. will buy agian.
4,Great inexpensive alternative,"I have a 12 year old car and I've had to replace the window regulator and motor a few times. It has cost me an average of about $250-300 each time. The two back windows stopped working a few months ago and I had been dreading fixing them. I called a couple shops and got an estimate- again each window averaged $260 for a total of $520. I wasn't looking forward to spending that much money to fix windows on an old car :(I read reviews and I got the parts from Amazon for a grand total of $110.00. Parts were delivered quickly. I found a guy on Craigslist who installed them both for $70.00. Total cost of $180, total savings of $340.00. Thank you Amazon. Parts work great and the dogs are happily sticking their heads out of the windows now :)"
1,when are we,this series jumps all over the place. it doesn't know where or when it wants to be so neither do we. it never got any better the more i watched it the more i was what the ------. the only thing it did have was a complete ending. yeah they can't make any more. the art work was ok but i have seen better and the music was mediocre at best. the special features also were not the best.
1,Not the same,"Not the same item that is shown in the picture, its a smooth leather. Not the textured kind shown in the picture."
3,A stronger scent than I anticipated,I really like the mustela products but this one has a pretty strong (but nice) odor. It's not too powdery or sweet or cloying like many baby products but it's still pretty lingering.
3,Well worth purchasing...,"I bought this to finish up a fairy costume. It's not a toy, which is the reason behind the sort of standard ratings I put. It works very well for a purse and was the perfect coloring to match the costume. When used, it holds more things then I thought possible because it is a lot bigger then you'd think.The quality is well worth it as it held up to very rough treatment. As for how it looks, the picture does it justice. It really does look exactly like it's shown!"
1,No understanding of military history,"Understanding the military campaigns of the numerically weaker side is one of the more challenging issue in history. Unfortunately, Mr Palmer displays a thorough lack of historical perspective in this very weak presentation.Palmer's protrait of Robert E Lee as lacking all the necessary mental capacities when it comes to undertaking offensive warfare is completely devoid of historical understanding of the campaigns involving generals such as Hannibal, Caesar, Frederick the Great, Napoleon and many others who commanded numerically inferior armies. And of course, Palmer offers absolutely no supporting evidence to prop up his claims because in this book the outcome of the campaign is proof enough.I agree with another reviewer here that this piece is very agenda-driven, simply because of the thin presentation, no supporting evidence, which could only come from a lack of understanding of the campaigns involving the Great Captains."
1,Faux Paw Meets the First Lady: How to Handle Cyber-bullying,"I am a school social worker who proactively addresses the issues of teasing, bullying, and cyberbullying. This book was so diappointing! It is very cumbersome with many superfluous and irrelavent details. The learning center director in our elementary school agreed. I sent this book back...which I have never done.J.S. Freedman, M.S.W., L.C.S.W."
4,EXTREMELY TALENTED IS EDDIE,"Eddie Murphy would have to be my favourite actor.He is very talented and shows it in this film!He nearly plays as the whole family and does a dam good job at it.This movie is very funny.His family are pigs and the fart scene goes over board as he takes his new girlfriend (pinkett) to his house for dinner.Also buddy love steals the show Eddie murphy's other character more of a wild and funny character who gets the job done with out trying also captures pinketts eye and she starts falling for buddy!Buddy is exremely funny.The Reggie scene is great and probably the funniest scene.This is another eddie murphy classic, and sits up there as 1 of his best, not the best but 1 of his best.3 1/2 stars for the mivie and 1/2 star for Eddie murpheys talent as all the roles he played , even a grandma!!RECOMMENDEDAlso i will just say check out some other Eddie Murphy films as they are all great!"
4,FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Eddie Murphy playing 7 or 8 characters is so great and funny. This movie is hilarious! I think Granny's stories about Mike Douglas and relations are funny as hell. Lance Perkins' workout is also extremly funny. But dont see the sequel. Its totally unfunny, nothing like this."
2,NOT SO NUTTY PROFESSOR,"Yes, Eddie Murphy is amazingly chameleonic in this reworking of Jerry Lewis' classic 1963 comedy. Unfortunately, Eddie's not totally funny in this crass update. If you're into flatulence or fat jokes, then this movie is right up your alley. But its threadbare plot takes second place to Eddie's mugging not only of his title character and alter ego, but also all of the Klumps as well. Jada Pinkett is the customary African/American woman who does her best (Like Halle Berry or Vanessa Williams) to look as Caucasian as she can. The late James Coburn as a cameo role as a hotshot millionaire out to fund Murphy's research project, and Dave Chappelle has a bit as a stand up comic who is not all that funny either. While the intentions are good, THE NUTTY PROFESSOR of 1996 doesn't capture the manic charisma of the one and only Jerry Lewis whose mugging was more charming than obnoxious."
3,It Never Fails,"I have worked with different types of data links and communication hardware for five years. When it comes to handy references, this book is a must! It has never let me down."
2,It Put Me to Sleep! -- Just Talk with Your Doctor Instead,"Rarely do I quit reading a book -- I usually always go to the end. This title was the exception. Having a snoring problem and seeking some insight, I purchased ""Snoring from A to Z"" to learn more about my condition. While the author does give some general information in the early part of the book, the rest of the pages are nothing more than a reference guide for various medical techniques to remedy snoring. None of these techniques could be done by one's self -- each would require a doctor's supervision and administration. I'd recommend saving your money and passing on this title -- go to some sleep disorder sites on the Web, or just discuss the matter with your physician."
1,faught with this pen all semester,I stuck with this rotten pen all semester because of how much I paid for them at the campus book store here at the University of Wisconsin-madison. Definitely the worst pen I ever paid money for....it is even harder to use if you have to write small and fast while taking lecture notes. They should give me a full refund and be glad I don't sue for the pain and suffering it has caused me this semester. What a piece of crap!
3,Good,This covers Chevy's racing years. Doesn't have any information about the small indepentants who did so much work making the Chevy engine work in the high performance industry.
2,Good if you documents are small and not glossy.,"I purchased this a few years ago to contain my vehicle registration and insurance instead of stashing them in the car's manual. My insurance cards are glossy and stuck inside the pockets leaving a copy of the card's red and black print inside. I'm in Florida, so I have to fold our current overly long registration to fit it in. Since I can't use the pockets, it's just an giant paper clip. I paid under half of Amazon's current price and I think that's all it's worth."
4,"Great flavor, just can't get used to it.","This stuff has a great flavor and is made with real ingredients...but actually using it will likely be a love-it/hate-it. Just dipping into the jar, the spicy raspberry flavor was really nice... but I never could get used to my meat tasting like spicy raspberry. Same deal with crackers...So...great flavor, and if your taste buds aren't as stubborn as mine, it'll probably go over pretty well. Otherwise, it has a great flavor with nowhere to put it."
3,Interesting as a glaze,"This sauce is interesting given it's thick consistency and sweetness, while paired with the heat of the Chipotle pepper. It's tasty, but a little too sweet for my taste. Brushed on lightly as a glaze is the best method in my opinion. Don't try doing that if you still need to broil. This sauce will most certainly burn. There's a lot of flavor going on in here, but it is predominantly the fruit that takes hold. The spiciness is more ""heat"" than ""flavor"" as you normally would expect from something with Chipotle."
2,"Wanted it to be good, turned out to be just wierd","I really wanted this to be good. I thought it had a lot of potential. Unfortunately it tastes like a rasberry salad dressing more than anything else. I personally could not even tell it had chipotle in it.Not bad, but with the exception of a salad dressing type application, I couldnt thing of anything good to put it on. Definately not good for a bbq sauce or grilling application."
2,Two flavors not meant to be together,"I found this to be a rather peculiar item. The label suggests that it is great with meat/fish and can top cheese slices for a snack.. I couldnt bring myself to do those things. yuck. But I did try the suggestion of using this to make your own Raspberry Vinagrette salad dressing.Somehow sweet(and gooey) raspberry does not meld well with the bite of a salsa style pepper. I kept trying to convince myself this was good. I failed, My tongue just would not co-operate. I simply cannot fathom putting this on a lovely slice of sharp cheeder or Gouda. Dont waste your time on this product."
3,Not my taste,"I have never tried a chipotle sauce before so I was curious, especially since many reviewers were raving about its unlimited uses. I have mixed it in my salad dressing and it was awful, my dressing was sweet and overpowering. I prefer my salad dressings on the sour side. I have tried to use it as a marinade, with the same result - too sweet and overpowering. I like using spices in food to bring out and accentuate the taste of the ingredients. It seems that the chipotle sauce does the opposite, it totally overpowers the food and everything tastes sweet and raspberry like. Not for my European palette."
3,"Thick, sweet and tangy, but too smokey","I tried this sauce on chicken, but it's probably better on pork as most of the rcipes indicate. Mix this 1/2 and 1/2 with red wine or teriyaki for a marinade.It's sweet and sassy, but a little too heavy on the liquid smoke flavor for me... Great concept, so-so execution."
4,"Vegetarian didn't expect to like it, but it's yummy","I didn't expect to think much of this. Being a vegetarian, I don't have a lot of need for chipotle sauce. But substituted for sweet and sour sauce, this is great. Use it on egg rolls, the vegetable-type veggie burgers, or in other dishes you'd use for sweet and sour and it's pretty addictive! It is quite sweet with a strong raspberry flavor, but there's a very smoky barbeque-y flavor as well. Yum."
4,Great Taste!,"This sauce is so tasty and you can use it with anything! I have not tried it with beef, but I have used it with Shrimp and Chicken and it's tasty! It has the right amount of sweetness and BBQ flavoring. Would definitly purchase!"
3,Not bad,"This sounded interesting. It was pretty good, but not my favorite. Maybe the vinegar flavor was a little intense for me. (I'm not a big vinegar fan.) It is very strong flavored, and I can't imagine using the recommended amount. I'm sure some people would like this more than me."
2,"Horrible, but in another way","The Blackstone Chronicles begin with a horrible start: Even at approx. 80 pages it was hard for me to finish this book. It's typical Saul, but several notches below his standard. I hope the series will improve. Why the low rating? This book features characters you don't care for and an absolutely predictable and silly storyline"
3,Can't compare this to the Green Mile. It lacks something.,"Right now I'm about fifteen pages into this book and I have to force myself to pick it up everytime I come back to it. Foolishly I have bought his next three in anticipation. If his next three are anything like the first it's going to be a long haul from beginning to end. Next book, please! Sorry, John"
2,Please don't bother,"I bought this book on a whim and it was NOT A GOOD BUY!!!! Recently I got a mini trampoline (rebounder) because a friend suggested it would help with weight loss. I figured this book would give me an exercise plan or a good workout to follow, it did neither. The book is basic and not any more helpful then me telling you what you already know, jump up and down on the trampoline and eventually you'll lose weight by actually doing something involving exercise. I didnt learn any new tips I didnt already know and if you seriously are interested in this book, let me know and I'll just give it you the copy I wasted my money on!!!!"
5,Too fun,"Ok, you can buy a $5000 watch to impress superficials who recognize power names. I did that although ""those watches"" cost $400 just to service and clean every couple of years and I now feel idiotic to have done that. This watch is just plain fun and probably keeps equally accurate time. You don't want to climb Everest with this like Rolex touts. But I feel very practical and even Avant Gard wearing this. Every time I wear it someone asks about it and smiles. For about the price of a large Pizza and a lot longer lasting, you can't go wrong. Oh yeah, kids seem to like them to."
1,"Battery Dead, and impossible to change","This watch arrived with a dead battery. A few attempts to change it resulted only in scuffing the plastic back, so now it is a dead watch with gouged plastic. No useful instructions come with it."
4,Very cool lLEGO watch!,"This watch is a cool product for either kids or adults who are serious LEGO fans. The watch features a selection of three different bezels, each of which connect easily. The watch band pieces are easy to connect, and stay together solidly once connected. There are sufficient links to accomodate wrists ranging from small children to large-wristed adults.However, the watch face itself is rather large, so the watch may be a bit too big for small children to wear regularly."
3,Hasbro Game Pack,The Monopoly and Scrabble gamexs are very good as was the combined price. I could not get the Clue game to run
3,Interesting subject matter...rambling prose,"While the subject matter of this book is quite intriguing, the writing style of Ms. D'Amato leaves a great deal to be desired. Quite frequently the text goes off on a tangent, then quickly returns to the subject at hand, and the reader is left scratching their head, wondering why the author even brought up the ""sidebar"".As it is probably the only book available (to my knowledge) on Mr. Johnson and Mr. D'Amato, I can recommend it from a subject perspective. Just be prepared to have to go back and re-read sections trying to make some sense of them."
4,A unique photographic outlook is needed,"Although this book may not contain the same type of pictures of route 66 that you might see in a magazine, they are cool and unique in their own way. There are a few pointless ones, but there are also a few that are very good snapshots. I picked it up at a used bookstore for $4....a good addition to my growing photo gallery."
5,"Great book, great author !",Really helpful in setting up a proper Prospect Management System. I can recommend his other books as well !
1,Stay Away from this TV,"I owned the tv for about 3 weeks, then all of a sudden the tv turned off. The little red light on the front was blinking and there was clicking sound when I unplugged it and tried to turn it on again. A service technician came out and ordered a new part for it.Then less that 4 days later the unit made a pop sound and the picture schrunk about 3 inches on the left and right sides - no luck.Luckily, I bought it from a local store and can return it , no questions asked.I suspect from reading other posts that this Toshiba has put a real lemon on the market."
5,Ever Wonder Why You Think What You Think?,"I don't have the depth or scope of knowledge to give an in depth review of Jurgen Moltmann's work in this or any of his other writings. However, you will find his thinking to be both insightful and stimulating if you take the time to engage him. In The Coming of God, Moltmann unpacks the history of Christian and Jewish eschatology and the incredible impact these two systems of thought have had on western modernity - the philosophical system that shapes what we in the west think and how we view the world, our place in it and our political, economic and cultural structures.However, his purpose in The Coming of God is not to simply trace the history and influence of Christian and Jewish eschatology in the west, but to critique and present his thinking on just what it means to think of the coming of God to creation.Moltmann is someone you should read."
1,There's a reason you can get this book for half price,"This book is terrible. It's 352 pages of character development, much like The Phantom Menace. The plot isn't too bad in concept, but other than Obi-Wan and Anakin, the characters are made very uninteresting, and they spend the whole time doing boring things that I didn't really care about. At one point, the four Jedi involved take turns entertaining their hosts with singing, dancing and storytelling. Foster spends many pages on this. It was boring and meaningless, other than for character development, and why is he developing characters halfway through the novel?Foster doesn't paint the inhabitants of Anison very well. It was very hard to get a mental picture of any of them, which was frustrating. I had to force myself to finish this novel, promising myself that it would get better, but it never did. Very boring. I expected much better. Save you money and time."
3,Too drawn out.,"I must start off by saying I am a big fan of all the Star Wars novels, especially the books that are compilations of short stories (Tales of Bounty Hunters/Mos Eisley Cantina/Jabba's Palace/etc.). I have read many of the ""series"" books as well, such as the Han Solo trilogy and the Bounty Hunter Wars. I was excited about this book because it was a prequel to one of the movies. It started off very interesting, but I found that it soon became repetitive because random things just kept happening over and over again. To me, it almost seemed like half of the stuff was filler just to make the story fill an entire 363 page book. I gave it a 3-star rating not because I thought it was a bad book, just because I thought it was not as good as other Star Wars novels I had read (storywise). As for the writing, Foster does an excellent job in his portrayel of Ansion and of the characters. I just thought that the story was way too drawn out."
5,I Loved it!,"Besides being a great source of background info about the events of Episode II: Attack of the Clones, this book was a breath of fresh air to someone like me who has been reading the relatively depressing New Jedi Order series.What I like the best about this book is meeting Luminara Unduli (whose picture is on the cover next to Anakin and Obi-Wan) and her padawan apprentice Bariss Offee. Until this point we hadn't met too many female Old Replublic Jedi, so meeting Luminara and Bariss in this book was a treat for me.I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes Star Wars and wants to read a light-hearted, but also serious book."
5,Just get it,It is what it is. A Ralphie bobblehead! It sure beats the hell out of putting another snow globe on your coffee table.
5,Goes with Dad,Ralpie and dad knockers together for the holiday. hope to buy more of the christmas story stuff. Happy new Year
5,Best unknown show,"This was absolutely a best buy. Case Closed is one of the best shows you've never heard of and what makes it so interesting is that its a show that doesn't hold back graphic wise and provides you with complicated puzzles that make you open your mind to things you might not have thought possible. This isn't a show for you people out there that like t.v. that feeds stupidity, but if you like to be challenged then this is the show for you. Check it out, you wont be disappointed."
2,Didn't hold my attention,This book started off promising. But I found I lost interest in it part way through. After awhile I was reading to finish it so I could start something better.
4,Sunday Only Psalms,"After hearing some of these psalms being read I had to have the book to read them all only to discover that only those included in the lectionary are used.When several of our group get together to read I found that I had to skip several of the Psalms because they were not included in the book or were incomplete. Those in the book are outstanding. However, being limited to the lectionary is disappointing."
2,"Auburn has snotty fans, see this DVD for why","I was at this game. I sat right behind Booger, aka Adam from Camp Crystal Lake (see above). Adam used to post as Booger. He was real snotty during this game. On top of that, he picked his nose throughout the entire game, and was flicking his boogers (hence his name) on Alabama fans sitting near him. I didn't think that was a very sportsmanlike thing to do. This game telecast has a shot of Booger with his index finger buried deep into his nostrils, scooping out a big green sticky mass of hardened phlegm from his nose, so it is worth buying just to see that shot. The funny thing is, later in the game some Alabama fans, fed up with getting boogers flicked on them, gave Booger an atomic wedgie right during the game. Its just too bad this video didn't capture that epic moment."
3,Difficult,It looks amazing but there are a few things that do not work the way they should. First of all the blade and handle do not fit the sheath so you have to use the slide mechanism to even fit the sheath. Secondly the button mechanism is somewhat less than reliable. When you push the button it has to be ever so perfect if you want it to slide. it looks cool but don't buy for functionality
4,Good CD by above average metalcore/death metal band,"""Horror"" is definitely borderline death metal, the metalcore elements come out in some of the chugga-chugga riffing (of course meant for mosh-ability). This gets listed as metalcore mainly because they are on the Prosthetic label. They, like many of their counterparts, infuse a decent amouont of Swedish-style riffing and leads. Cannae are obviously at least somewhat influenced by At The Gates. One thing you won't find here is any punk sounding parts with pretty emo vocals. This rips all the way through. The drumming is also a high point, for me at least. ""Horror"" is a good CD in most regards, not really original, but good. Fans of Bleeding Through, The Agony Scene, or even In Flames, Arch Enemy, Dimension Zero and bands of the like, would do good to check this one out."
1,"""dud"" shuffler","This shuffler didn't work from the beginning. Won't pull cards(tried 2 different sets of cards) into shuffler. Got the run-around from the seller and amazon. Each one said to contact the other one....so, I lost my money and learned a lesson."
4,Perfect read for a Saturday morning,"This book is a perfect two-hour read for a Saturday morning after listening to the author on NPR's Saturday Morning Edition. The reader can hear Mr. Simon's distinctive and familiar voice when reading the pages. The book is not intended to be a comprehensive history on baseball's integration or a biography of Jackie Robinson, as noted in the opening pages. Rather, it provides just the right amount of background on Mr. Robinson and Mr. Richey, as well as the context surrounding events. Mr. Simon's notes and examples stimulate readers to learn more about particular people and events. I particularly recommend this book (and possibly the series from the list of forthcoming books) as a quick read for adults and teenagers who desire to read about the people and events that shaped our nation, yet must balance the responsibilities of family, work and community, which may prevent them from reading longer books."
2,Miss christine,If you are looking for a positive view on cancer this book is for you. Not very informative as far as cancer and treatments are concerned. And miracles don't always come in healing from cancer.
1,Hobby Tron - not worth the order,All plastic ... broke on first use. Wonder if this company exists. Can't get a response via email or their 800 # and I've been trying to return this product since 12/26!
1,IT SUCKS,This gun is horrible i dont reccomend that anyone buys it it broke the same day i recieved it everything broke one thing after another it is perfect if you just plan to hang it on your wall and never use it but if you plan to use it its worthless and breaks very easy do not buy it ur better buying one thats a little bit more expensive but you know will last you way longer . p.s DO NOT BUY THIS GUN IT SUCKS
1,Will not read this book.,"I saw this book on another site and ordered it without checking these reviews. Big mistake! Will be sending this book back and will gladly pay shipping. I am not expecting a refund, I just do not want this book as part of my library. I do not care if this guy has a PHD, from the list of books he has authored or co-authored on so many different subject matters,it is evident that he is just another money hungry right winger."
1,Disappointing,"After reading the claims that this book would turn the world on it's ear, I was expecting a whole bunch more. There's been more than 50 years of scientific research into fossil fuels, I find it difficult to believe that all of a sudden everything we know about oil is wrong. A few quoted technicians versus 1000's of teams of geologists and research specialists doesn't seem like a fair match.This book didn't prove it to me, oil is fairly obviously becoming harder and harder to drill for, and more expensive to bring up. The Canadian Shale takes almost as much energy in natural gas to produce the oil as it's worth, and they can only generate a million barrels a day. Hardly enough to make a difference in a world that uses 89 million barrels of oil per day.For another book in this category I highly recommend Michael Ruppert's ""Crossing the Rubicon"". THAT book makes sense, and scares me as a see the effects of our diminishing cheap oil supply."
2,Disappointing,"I was really excited when this movie came out. Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon Levitt are usually very engaging to watch, but this story also seemed to hold a lot of promise. However, this movie heavily failed to deliver an enjoyable cinematic experience. It's unfortunate, but I felt the director was so consumed with trying to make Joseph Gordon Levitt look and act like Bruce Willis, the rest of the movie fell between the cracks. Hard to watch."
3,Mediocre,"Disappointing. I'm glad I waited for video to watch this one. It's wasn't so bad that I turned it off, but I certainly couldn't recommend it to anyone. I kept waiting for it to get better. And it didn't. The premise of time travel was silly and there wasn't much more depth to it than a cat and mouse shoot 'em up. I prefer Bruce Willis' Die Hard series. If you rent this, keep your expectations low."
4,Thought-provoking but not difficult to follow.,"This is an entertaining movie with a talented cast. It's a surprisingly straight-forward tale, though if you think too long about the mechanics of the plot device, it doesn't always play by it's own rules. But that didn't take away from my enjoyment of the story at all."
3,"Not thrilled, but decent action flick.","I felt this was a decent action movie, which was all I was looking for when I rented it. The plot is interesting and fairly unique, but the ending was kind of predictable. There were some holes in the plot, but part of watching a movie is suspending your beliefs and just enjoying the show.The acting was good and I felt it was well cast. I would recommend this movie to action/thriller movie lovers who are looking to be casually entertained - not those looking to be blown away or amazed by ""genre defining film."""
3,Ehh...,"It was a pretty interesting concept. It was kind of confusing at times, but as long as you actually pay attention in movies, you eventually catch on. My biggest issue with it is it was really slow up until the last 20-30 minutes. It wasn't awful, but I wouldn't say it was good."
2,Terrible Ending,"Oh God. It was great until the ending. Its that whole hipster, nihilist, self-loathing philosophy that life would be better if you didn't exist. C'mon. Yes it was good sci-fi, yes it was well acted and directed, but the story was Just. Completely. Lacking.Compare this to say 12 Monkeys, no comparison. Its like they didn't know what to do at the end, so they took a dive off the cliff and figured they'd make money anyways with the cast....Wouldn't have watched it if I had known."
4,Chicken and the Egg,"In all it was a pretty good movie.Disliked:At some point there is talk about a closed loop. Without research I found it a little unclear as to the original cause of it all, it bugged me for a little.There are a few scenes in the movie that seemed would be of great importance later, but were not. I'd rather have had more explanation of the time period, how things came to be, and more development on the secondary important characters.Liked:Dedication to making Levitt appear to be similar to WillisDoes not drag, the movie develops nicely throughout the film without giving away immediately what would happen next -- it was fun to discuss/guess thoughts of what would happen next."
3,"Interesting concept, but slow to play out","Obviously you know where the film is going from the very start, but it takes quite a bit of time to play out. There are components of the plot that seem token inclusions, that might add to the meat of things if fleshed out a little bit more. You won't regret watching this film, but I'd say it's a strong rental rather than purchase-worthy as it's unlikely to be watched a second time."
3,Disjointed & profane...but interesting concept,"I felt the plot in this movie was disjointed -- there really was one main theme at the beginning but then transformed into another ""main"" plot about half-way through the movie. While the concept was interesting, it didn't play true through the end of the movie to this concept -- even the end felt hurried and weird....I didn't feel that attached to the characters at the end nor really care about the result because it was all over the place.There really is not a need to lace a movie with excessive profanity like this one did -- I understand the use of profanity may be needed to establish a character, but not EVERYONE has to use it ALL the time like this movie did.Also, unnecessary nudity -- this movie had the obligatory strip joint scene, but stuck in a couple of nude shots -- all this did, along with the profanity, was make it an R rated movie."
2,"If you have some time to waste, rent this one","Action, ok. Characters, ok. Story line......not so much. Ending, dark. Watch it if you have nothing else to do, otherwise, do something productive."
1,Spare Yourself This Trash,I don't want to waste any more time on this piece of garbage so just a short review. The acting is marginal and the story is pathetic. Just do NOT watch this complete pile of dung.
1,"Stupid kid killers, broken time travel","Idiots rob their corpses from the future so they can live in luxury until sent back into the past to be killed by the person they were when they were younger and not as stupid, except when it doesn't happen even though it already did. After collecting on having killed himself back when he was that kid from Third Rock and Inception, you know, Robin from Dark Knight Rises, Bruce Willis, for no reason, wasn't killed, and goes on a shooting spree, aiming guns at toddlers who might grow up to become Hitler. Everybody in this world is a knuckle-dragging neanderthal shooting gigantic cartoon weapons that may as well have come from the Acme Gag Factory in Toon Town. You could have been watching Brick, or Primer, or 12 Monkeys, or Back to the Future, or Terminator, or Bowling for Columbine, all of which would be more pleasant experiences than this."
1,Awful,"The slowest, most mundane flick I've seen in recent times. From Levitt's look which was an epic failure to the slow drawl of a premise that plays itself out like a B-grade contender, skip on out on this one would be my strong recommendation."
3,Kinda boring...,"Loved the acting, loved the storyline...but, kinda boring. I kept thinking I would see more action like you'd see in a 'Bourne' movie. Not the case. Also, I love Levitt-but his make-up looked really fake. Sadly disappointed."
2,Could have been better,"The premise is interesting and the make up artists did a good job making Joseph Gordon-Levitt look like Bruce Willis and he did a good job mimicking some of Bruce's mannerisms and expressions that he is famous for. The story line is a little weak though. The ending could have been so much better and stronger. If you're fan of Bruce Willis, futuristic movies like Total Recall you might enjoy it."
2,Not as clever as critics say,Not a terrible movie but nothing stellar either. Falls far short of other time travel related movies like Terminator and Back to the Future. Plot was quite predictable too.
4,Entertaining,"I wish it was more consistent with any one theory for time travel paradoxes or the concepts were so far away from reality that the inconsistencies weren't aggravating. Otherwise, I thought the movie was well done and very engaging."
4,Good sci-fi movie,This movie plays like a Philip K Dick story. Its set in a dark dystopian future and the main character has to make deep decisions between selfish or selfless behavior.
1,Terrible movie,"There was nothing positive or redeeming about this movie. The concept sounded really interesting, but the movie itself wasn't enjoyable."
1,1/10,"Joe Levitt's new upper lip had more charisma and ethos than either of the two characters. Willis shoots children and Levitt shoots up. There is a time paradox, but it seems slow in coming and anticlimactic after it's over. This had a big enough budget to get Joss Whedon to edit the script. It's too bad the actors didn't demand it. Don't see this movie, check your email instead. It'll be more gratifying."
1,GARBAGE!,"After all the hype recently from reviewers who were probably paid off by the studio, myself and my girlfriend went to see this in a theatre recently. Not only did my girlfriend fall asleep to this over-rated movie, but I had trouble staying awake. It was cliche ridden and it reminded me of Jessica Alba's excellent TV series Dark Angel from 2000, which is a much better choice of DVDs. Don't waste your time on this crap!"
3,Good ! could be better.,Good movie. I like Joseph Gordon Levitt and who doesn't like Bruce Willis? The story was good and the ending was a surprise but I was left feeling like there should have been more. I purchased this movie but I'm thinking this one would be better as a rental.
2,Boring,This movie did not make much sense. I kept checking the timer to see when it would be over.Would not recommend.
3,Confusing,"Probably have to watch again, because I found this violent movie to be very confusing and leaving you with more questions than answers. Won't rent or buy it to watch again."
2,Not what you might expect.,"Looper was not bad, but it was certainly not good. The plot was not what the trailer implies, and in the end, everything seemed meaningless."
5,good,it was entertaining throughout. it's hard for me to sit through a movie but i really liked this one. k
3,Good Movie - Not as good I anticipated,"When I saw the preview months ago I could NOT WAIT for this movie to come out. I finally rented it on Amazon and it was good. It was not the ""edge of my seat"" thriller I was hoping for based upon the preview, but I was certainly not disappointed. Worth watching.Wouldn't pay $10 for a ticket to the theatre.If I had to go back I'd wait for it to come to Redbox and pay just over $1 instead of $4 on Amazon..."
4,Highly recommended,"Unexpected twists and turns make it a fun, enjoyable ride. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is barely recognizable in a markedly different role from his other films like Inception). Would definitely recommend watching this movie."
2,story line at fault,"broken up story line hard to follow, not Bruce Willis finest. Future story dealing with Blulder busses? If they can transport someone, why not to mediaval time?"
3,Not quite as good as I was hoping,Not as good as I thought it would be but still pretty enjoyable. The ending was kind of predictable though.
4,Pretty good film.,"Seen this one in theaters. I didn't know too much about it going in but didn't walk out disappointed. I think they should have shed a little more light on the psychic abilities because that turns out to be a big role in the film later and when that part surfaces it kinda leaves you confused. By the time that part surfaced I completely forgot about the abilities some of the people have. Must say I did not expect that ending at all.I think this is one of those movies that are good, you watch a few times but will probably loose its value once you know what happens. More of a rent movie than one I'd buy."
2,Violent and Disturbing,This was a very strange movie with violence aimed at and from children. This seems most inappropriate considering the horror that this represents when it's actually played out. I like dystopic and sci fi movies but even there I think there should be some boundaries which this movie grossly overstepped.
1,Will not play,It refuses to play. This is the first Bluray out of the many that I have ordered that does not work.
1,Total crap,This movie is a waste of time & money. It's just another shoot em up movie with weak characters and lots of criminal violence against children.
2,Did not care for it...,"I am not a sci-fi fan and went to see this moving because of the cast, but they did not win me over. It is a confusing plot/story line. The only reason it didn't get a 1 start is because of the captivating performance of young Pierce Gagnon as Cid."
3,Great story,I really thought the story was creative and appreciated how much thought must have gone into all the aspects of changing history due to time travel. I was entertained and I liked Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance.
1,So bad!,"I have a pretty low bar as far as movies go, but this film was just terrible! Bad plot, bad acting, everything was awful. Total waste of time."
3,Looper,"It seems as if film making has hit a wall. It was ""Okay"" The movie lacked any real surprise. Wish I would have rented first."
4,Entertaining,"It was an entertaining time travel flick. Different from most TT's. I did find some parts confusing, but that's ok.. it will just make me watch it a few more times to figure out the time-line threads. There were what appeared to be some flaws in the TT logic, but it was pretty close."
2,Interesting concept poorly executed,"Interesting concept, but turns out to be far less about time travel and the paradoxes it could create than about violent, nasty people who don't shrink at killing adorable small children. The main characters all deserved what they got. The inclusion of a demonic child covered with blood did nothing to add to this film. Go watch ""Inception"" instead."
4,Thrilling and Original,It's been a long time since I've seen a sci fi film this good. Kudos to all involved!Bruce Willis seemed to really get into his role and the film had a great look and feel.
2,didnt care for it,"boring to me and even tho willis was in it, just didn't make alot of sense to me just alot of violence"
3,It's okay.,"It's okay-ish. Some parts were quite nice. Well made. But as a whole, for instance, I felt like that one subplot, which will go unspecified to avoid spoilers, belonged in another movie."
3,Interesting but...,This was an interesting film yet I had to work at following it. I think they should have resequenced some events. Quality performances by the actors.
4,First rate Sci-fi and action,"Good performances and an interesting story made this well worth the view. Those trying to solve the mysteries on non-linear time through plot details of this movie are way over-thinking it. This is entertainment, not physics, and at that it succeeds. And let's face it - if your a guy - you could watch about any movie with Emily Blunt with the sound off and it would still be pretty good."
1,What the heck?,"I was excited to see this movie, but then it quickly turned to disappointment. So confusing and random. Just made no sense."
1,Horrible movie,A waste of money and I am surprised Bruce Willis was in this movieVery bad movie and had no plot
1,Sound is too soft,"I could not hear the dialog with headphones, absolutely no way with tv, but when there's an explosion it busts your ear drum. Tried to watch three times and too difficult."
2,Mediocrity,"The potential for what could have been done with this movie compared to how it was just dragged out and pointless. I would have expected so much more from a Bruce Willis film. Disappointing, but if you have absolutely nothing else going on.... Waste of time."
2,It was CONFUSING !,"The movie was quite confusing and kind of mixed up . I had to watch a few parts over but the movie still was like watching one of those Tarontino pieces of crap , The ending in the begining the begining at the end No substance in the middle except without the stupid Samari s*** . Sorry this movie was a DUD."
3,Looper,Fairly good movie. Glad I didn't go and see it in theater. Some parts were slow and other parts didn't make sense.
3,It was ok,"Not exactly what I expected. A little darker and kind of sad, I suppose. But, it was good with an interesting ending."
4,Causality loop movie worth watching again and again...,"Like most time travel movies - if you think about it too much, the logic will fall apart and with it your enjoyment of the film. However, ""Looper"" isn't really about time travel, or telekinesis and it certainly isn't a special effects heavy popcorn movie.""Looper"" is a well-acted study of what it is to be human - growth, change, fear, love, greed, guilt, sacrifice and how we justify our actions. The performances make the film, the story however, has been cobbled together from a hundred other movies you've seen before. The special effects and production design for a story set decades in the future are just okay - so don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.It's entertaining, and worth the purchase - and you'll only need to make space for one BluRay because there is not going to be a ""Looper 2"". Loop closed."
2,Wait until this is free to watch,"Had potential but flattens out after the first five minutes when you figer out everything and it goes into it's repeat, the repeat phase. Go to the beach instead or read something really interesting."
2,Disappointing!,This movie felt disconnected and confusing. My husband and I found ourselves looking at each other with perplexed expressions more than once. Where and when are they now? This guy is supposed to be Bruce Willis as a young man? Really? There is NO resemblance whatsoever! Had a potentially good story but very bad directing left the viewer feeling like numerous important scenes must have been cut. Don't waste your money.
5,Wow,Really good movie. Had me entertained the whole time. It's nice to know that people can still make good movies in a generation of remakes.
4,Not predictable and better story than expected,Looper is definitely worth watching at least once. The time travel premise is just a backdrop for an interesting story that keeps you guessing. I'd watch it again.
5,I love it when Bruce Willis time travels...,"Really good sci-fi movie. Don't blink or you will lose it... If you have to have everything explained to you and can't figure stuff out for yourself you probably won't get this movie. Don't think about the premise too much or you'll ruin it for yourself. Just sit back and enjoy. The best acting in the whole thing is the little kid, I have to wonder how they got that performance out of him. I'm gaining an appreciation for JGL and will probably watch him in more movies, the association was a good one."
4,Looper - Action with a little thought required,I was expecting a typical Bruce Willis action movie which is what I was in the mood for. I can't speak for everyone else but I had to put some thought into the mechanics of time travel on the various relationships and the ending surprised me. I've thought about the movie after seeing it and will watch it again.
1,Didnt watch it becuase of the inferior video quality,"Didnt watch it becuase of the inferior video quality. See my previous review for 'Your Sister's Sister"". didnt even bother."
3,Looper,Found this a difficult movie to get into as i am not a real fan of this type of movie .Not my best Bruce Willis movie
3,Experience REQUIRED,This book covers the details of specific HOW-TOs. Do not attempt purchasing this book if you are a beginner or if you are just looking for more information.
1,WORST CD I HAVE EVER PURCHASED BAR NONE!!!,"This is awful stuff. I love all sorts of music and have many fine performances of Beatle covers. The arrangements on this CD, such as they are (if you can even call them arrangements),sound as though they were done by a demented monk. The music starts and stops for no apparent reason. Do not buy this unless you want to punish yourself...it is not only depressing but annoying, how did this get released? I have never listened to something so poorly performed, John Lennon would roll over in his grave if he heard this. If the rest of the the String Quartets efforts are of this caliber, I think they should be hung with the strings of their own instuments and good riddence! Once again, don't buy this unless you really want to make yourself ill..."
5,Dental Business Sense,"This Book is a great overview of what goes on in the business part of a dental office.The main thing which is needed is a knowledge of the practice management softwareThe CD includes a truncated version of Dentrix, which is very popular with dental offices.Highly recommend.N.Kehrdentalassistingcareer.net"
3,Not my favorite scent,"It's my fault for not smelling this at the local retailer first, and I should have checked their prices first as well, but when I received my order from Amazon, I was disappointed with the smell of this. After reading other reviews, I did check out other items at the local store, and found that the Basil is really a great fresh fragrance. The Lemon Verbena is great also, but for my sensitive senses, it's a bit too much. All in all, the Mrs. Meyer's product line is really great, and I'm happy with the variety of options."
3,"Smells great, works on countertops.....","....but is not good for tile floors. It leaves a sticky, streaky residue - regardless of how little you mix with your gallon of water - so unless you like to mop twice, don't use this on the floor. Otherwise, you'll be mopping, and then mopping with something else to get the Mrs. Meyers off your tile!"
3,too much Zinc?,I've read other places that max dosage for zinc is 40mg and 30mg is the considered dosage for Vegans.I'm going to cut the dosage in half to prevent excessive copper loss from too much zinc.
4,What create competitive advantage of Multi National Corporat,"This book is good. It helps us to grasp reality the manager in multi National Corporation face. Based on effective theory of growth of the firm, empirical analysis implicates internal organization forms influence competitive advantage of multi National Corporation. (It support lundvall influential book on enational system and innovationf) It is interesting."
2,Could not finish it,Bought this book because of the great reviews. The choppy style it was wriiten in did not appeal to me and the way the character developemnt evolved I found myself not caring about the main characters.
5,action-packed crime story: so fast you need your own wheelman,"This book was one hell of a ride. It starts out fast and keeps going; I finished it in four days, the last 100 pages in just a few hours. The author's well-researched background from his first book This Here's A Stick-up has served him very well for this exciting, well-plotted noir. But he takes it up a notch with some quality writing and fairly thorough character development for a book only about 200 pages long. If you are a fan of Richard Stark, Dan Simmons's Joe Kurtz novels, or enjoyed James Sallis's Drive, this book is for you. I was sorry to see it end."
5,easy to follow from one chapter to another,"I use this book as a reference for many technologies I work which. Sometimes I need to focus on data, sometimes on voice, sometimes signalling. In order to review the basis or even to go into details, this book is very useful. I highly recomend this book as part of the library of telecom workers."
1,big disappointment,"After following all directions on this product, there was still static even on the clearest channel. Could not get clean reception. Big disappointment and would not recommend to anyone."
3,good hands free device for cell phone,"I purchased this transmitter about a year ago. The 3.5 mm cord has broke, had to replace. I have a LG voyager cell phone that I download my music to and use the transmitter in my car. The sound quality is ok, it could be better. I do like using it for hands free driving while talking on the phone, also for the GPS . If you are going to use it with a cell phone, you need to buy a adapter for the head phone jack on the phone. I give it 3 stars for the overall quality of the unit."
5,The most anointed worship music I've ever heard...,"If you're looking for very special music to play as you worship God or study His Word, this is it. I stumbled across this artist, and his worship music is by far the most anointed I have ever experienced. This is ""live worship"" from the World Prayer Center, and the presence of the Holy Spirit is very evident. Each time I play it, the cares of life just melt away, and I feel ""renewed."" It's excellent."
5,Worship at its best,I received my CD very fast and I can't stop listening to it. This is worship at it finest.
2,Yamaha CM500 Headset with built in Microphone,"Mike does not work. Tried it out and earphones work fine, however, mike did not. No instructions. Small plastic battery holder.What is it?"
2,No-go for music recording,"I was hoping to use the CM-500 headphone/microphone for project recording, and possibly performance. But I never could get the microphone to work. It came with some dorky battery-power for it; maybe I already destroyed it when my mixer gave it 48v phantom power. (MOTU Traveler firewire sound card.)The headphones are ok, I guess.Maybe these are great for gaming, plugged directly into a computer. I wouldn't know."
3,Mic is not noise canceling,Purchased many of these headsets for our sales team. The mic is very sensitive and can pick up sounds very easily. Not ideal for our situation here.
2,"Sound quality is bad, battery box is bad","I had a similar product for a couple years from Koss: Koss SB/45. It is at least twice as cheaper, but has better sound quality.AAA batteries doesn't fit very well to the battery box for powering up the mic. You have an option either to leave the cover open or break the box when closing it.I'm disappointed."
5,exceeded expectations,Purchased headset to use with my Amateur (Ham) radio station. Headset was so light I barely noticed it after 4 hours of using it. Microphone audio is great. Is as good or better than a commercial headset designed for Ham radio that costs over $160.00.
4,"Works well, but messy","My husband and I purchased this waterpik after comparing prices/reviews from various websites. My daughter has braces and we wanted to be sure she was cleaning thoroughly. It comes with several attachments which are suitable for cleaning braces. My daughter actually uses it without me constantly reminding her, so that is saying something! It does make a watery mess on my daughter's face and counter, but that seems to be the case with any of these types of products. It will be interesting to see what the dentist says at her next appointment."
5,i no longer floss!,"this is great...used to floss for a minute or 2...now only a minute of this, teeth feels clean without the bleeding"
3,WP-100 Waterpik,"I've read the reviews on this waterpik last year and took note of the good reviews that it had, so I went to a local retailer (CSV) to buy this for $64.00The jet settings are very weak, it's best to leave the water settings at 10.My previous generic waterpik was so strong, that it made my gums bleed....(thorough cleaning), but this waterpik is too weak in comparison.This waterpik will get the job done for you, removing food particles between your teeth, but you will still need to floss your teeth on a regular basis.PROS : NONECONS : Weak water pressure, Messy sink, Water storage too smallI give this a three star because in my opinion, it's overly-hyped."
5,bought this based on amazon reviews and i don't regret it,"really cleans in between teeth, best for those with braces, strength dial is spot on, and you can beat amazon's prices! do you teeth and gums a favor that will keep on giving and get one of these waterpiks. its better and more thorough than conventional flossing."
5,Best for Nasal Irrigation,"I primarily use this for sinus, or nasal irrigation. It is the best machine I have used for this purpose. Better than the Hydro-Pulse which sells for more than twice as much! Hydro-Pulse makes a big deal about pulsation of the water stream, but the Waterpik also pulsates. Beware, Hydro-Pulse (Hydro-Med) has a very, very strict return policy.The coiled cord management system works better than any other machine I have tried. I also like the lid which keeps dust out of the water tank. It is quieter than earlier Waterpik models.[...]"
2,Mr.,"Hose too short. Highest power setting is about mid range of old unit. Should have saved old unit and replaced the hose as new unit has only half the power as old one did. Don,t know where to go for service parts i.e. hose and attachments?"
4,Waterpik imports,"Waterpik arrived safe and sound. However it is not compatible with Australian volyage, so within minutes it was smokin'- ie strange acrid smell and billows of smoke from the unit. Turned it off and now can't use it at all.Aussie customers beware!!!!!"
1,Product does not work,"I just got this product in the mail not more than an hour ago, and on my first try I was dismayed to find that it does not work at all. I am extremely disappointed in this."
3,Too much hype.,"The main reason I purchased this item was because I have a broken tooth that I cannot fix at the moment. It works great for cleaning out food particles left behind but I am unimpressed with it otherwise. I fully accept that I may be using this incorrectly but my gums seem a little stressed since I started using it and my ""trouble"" plaque areas seem unaffected by it. I think it is truly one of those things that it works better for some than others."
3,Waterpik,"Purchased this product in the States only to find it didn't work here because of the voltage. Purchased another one in England but have to use it in the kitchen because you can't use a shaver plug, won't go into an extension lead, over here you cannot have a mains point in the bathroom as they do in the States.Love the product, please help."
2,Great- BUT BRITTLE HOSES -designed to break,"I loved this Waterpik, but brittle hose broke in less than 8mo. This is my 2nd Waterpik with a Broken Hose!!! SOOO CHEAP! It's like nylons that run .. hose is so hard to replace (for novice) that Waterpik's ceo's must be laughing all the way to the bank when consumers opt to buy a new one -thanks Waterpik ..BUT NO THANKS!"
1,Manufacturer doesn't stand behind their products!,"Buyer beware! Purchased this product specifically to use the PocketPik tip to clean between gum line and tooth. After using for a short time, the PocketPik tip attachment cracked and leaked. Contacted company and they refused to replace the defective attachment (FYI-part RETAILS for $4.50!) Draw your own conclusion-will no longer use their product."
5,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,We were told to get a flosser by our dentist for better dental health. We researched many and decided to get this one. We are so glad we did. Love the way it makes your mouth feel clean after using it. Check ups have also been better since we started using it.
5,Waterpik Ultra Water Jet,"The product is great. It represents a tremendous improvement over the 7-year old model that was replaced. However:I have one complaint about Amazon's Webpage on which, in bold type, I was advised that the Waterpik item qualified for free shipping. When I then clicked to order the item I was directed to one of your suppliers: Allergy Be Gone, and was charged $7.41 for shipping. If this isn't a ""bait and switch"" operation, I don't know what is!!! For my limited budget, I have a resonably good purchase history with Amazon.com and am very disapointed that your oversight of web-based operations does not prevent this sort of Customer manipulation;this bait and switch has ruined your reputation, in my opinion.... James Ashton, jcajr@connectwireless.us"
5,Great Product!,"For me this is an upgrade from a much older Waterpik.....and it is smaller, quieter, easier to use - and best of all does an even better job. My dentist has commented on my improved gum health!"
3,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,"This is a replacement item. The previous one lasted about four years. The machine still worked, tube connection below the handle cracked and water was flowing from there instead of the nozzle. This is indeed a weak point in the design. Other than that I would rate it at five stars."
5,Great product the Childen actually use,"This product is just what the children needed while having their braces. Using room temp water, this gets the food out between the braces."
3,Good WaterPick but far from the best possible,"The concept of the Waterpik is simple, but the manufacturer did not try to make an excellent top quality product. They saved money by using a cheap water pick that can easily fall out of the handle. I am forced to hold the handle defensively hoping I won't get sprayed. The ""On-Off"" button would be better located on the handle."
5,great seller,"the waterpic that I purchased from Amazon was fantastic price, shipped fast and I would not hesitate to buy from this companyDottie Laurenzano"
1,received under powered unit,The product I received does not produce the power even on the highest setting to properly clean teeth. I plan to return unit for another which hopefully will work the way it should. I tested a unit in my dentist office and found a dramatic difference in power or force.
4,I like this a lot,This works very well and my dentist even commented on how clean my teeth were. I purchased one because my mom has one and loves it. Definitely recommend this waterpik!
1,A piece of junk,"This new design is horrible. The water resevoir holds less than the old model.Both the holder of all the individual pick pockets and othere tips, broke, as did the holder of the handle, within a few months after purchase.The whole design of this waterPik is ugly, too.WHY did they change the design from the original model, which was also more durable.This new one is an expensive piece of junk."
4,small and effective,i own it from about a month and am very happy with it.ioo hate flossing a lot so i dont do it everyu day. With this i look fwd to clean my teeth every night.
4,"Works great, but use with caution","Works as advertised. Amazing how much ""stuff"" this gets out, even after a thorough brushing. One word of caution: this flosser can blow or force plaque or debris up under the gums, resulting in infected gums which require a dentist's attention. Happened to both my wife and I. I am still using it, but am very careful when I do. It is NOT easy to use this in such a way as to prevent forcing plaque up under your gums. All in all, I gave this 4 stars because it does work great, but I would probably NOT recommend it because it is so susceptible to causing gum problems."
1,waterpik ultra,"Although I do lots of shopping on line with Amazon,I purchased the Waterpik ultra in Walmart...I've been through 3 different machines with all the same outcome..After a few months of use the pause button on the handle gets stuck and wont release the water...You dont want to buy this product,its poorly designed and obviously"
5,Healthy mouth and gums,"Waterpik Ultra Dental Water JetIf you want to ensure that you will NOT have gum disease in the future, purchase one of these and use it religiously. My dentist told me that I have sav ed my teeth and gums."
5,Cleaner teeth and nicer smelling breath,I have been very happy with my Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser. It makes my teeth feel much cleaner and my breath smell better on the days I use it.
1,New WaterPik inferior to old,"I bought this product to replace an old WaterPik (model 49)-- a great piece of machinery that I would have kept on using, except that the plastic hose leading from the water well to the appliance tip split and couldn't be replaced. This new model is remarkably inferior. I can barely feel the water pressure generated, even with the most focused tip and with the highest setting.I sent a complaint to WaterPik, via their website and have yet to hear back.I would never recommend anyone buy this product."
4,Powerful,"So far I am very pleased. It has lots of power and hopefully the hose of the wand will not break likethe old one I had, although it lasted about 6 yearsbefore that happened. I love the feature of beingable to adjust the pressure, I tried the maximumpressure and could not tolerate it."
4,Works Great,"My gums used to bleed a lot every time I go for my 6 months cleaning. They don't anymore.I would give a 5 stars if the flow control button on the handle/wand doesn't become stuck very 6 months. But, I have no trouble get a free replacement from their customer service."
4,Very Good,"It works well. I brush and floss but I am ""older"" and have started to develop gum disease. Had I known that this could be an important tool keep my teeth and gums healthy, I would have bought one a long time ago. So now I floss, brush and then use the Waterpik. This is just in addition to your regular routine. It feels good when you use it."
3,acceptable performance,"It is much better than string floosing, but that is only true if you have braces, I feel that it is inferior if you do not have braces as it can push food particles out only from areas that are relatively opened."
3,Can't compare to the original WaterPik,"I bought the original WaterPik about 30 years ago and loved it. Easy to use, easy to store, turn on and off while using it, manipulate as I was using it, etc. This one has more bells & whistles but I find it clumsy to operate. There's a bunch of attachments, but only designed for one person to use, whereas the original came as a 4 person set. But alas, the original finally wore out and I just can't seem to do without a water pik now. It does the job and I'm trying to reprogram myself to make it easier to use."
4,Good Buy,"I've never really thought about my teeth too much as I've never had any problems- until my last check up. I had heard that a waterpik was more effective than flossing and an electric tooth brush was more effective than a non-electrical one. I switched to both. It really makes a difference.This product has a bit of learning curve to it, but once you get the hang of it it's pretty easy to use. It comes with 6 different heads so there are lots of ways to make it work for you (braces, crowns, getting below the gum line, etc). It's not as big as I thought it would be so it's not taking up your whole counter. It's quiet. I've got nothing to complain about at all."
2,why is my sink wet?,"it has great power and that's where the compliments end!!! it leaked from day one, but i figured i could deal with that because it did work as advertised. it is [was] very loud, but i could deal with that because it worked as advertised. after about a month the unit stopped working all together, i am very disappointed, it is now in the city dump.."
2,Just like other versions of the same product - Another trap,"Waterpicks by the same manufacturer are just another trap and another way to waste your money. They do work, the original model is an annoyance as far as handling the narrow hose (or tube)conducting the fluid tothe tips. Almost impossible to house it back to its place in the equipment body.After a wjile, the machine stops workinf and you have to throw it out!The new model (the current one) attracted me because an supposedly way to house the hose+tip assembly. It worked for less than a month, them the machine went silent and stop working. Trash was the destination, just like the other ones.No more waterpicks from this manufacturer to me, no matter what my dentist or higyenist says."
4,Never Had One? Buy One!,"This being my first water pik, don't have anything to compare it to, but I'm happy with it. None of the leaking problems as reported in other reviews as long as the tip is inserted properly. If you've never used one before you'll find that no matter how well you think you've brushed and flossed, the pik will find some tiny particle or seed, once again proving my DDS to be smarter than the average bear. If you wear bridges, you need this."
5,Pleasant to use. Effective. Refreshing!,I love it! I just wonder why didn't I find it earlier. Warning: you need to have an outlet close to the sink.
4,Waterpik Review,"The waterpik performs as advertised, and does a much better job of removing food particles from between my gums than floss...with a lot less hassle. Particularly from the hard to reach places between the rear molars."
3,Short water tube,Works fine except the tube that feeds the water is too short! I would NOT recomended for a tall person.
3,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,"This flosser is very messy. Water runs all over when using it. Be sure to be over a sink and place a towel around the edge, for water runs down your arm and side of your face. Otherwise, it does a good job."
4,Teeth feeling cleaner than ever,"The pressure is perfect on this. If it were any stronger, I imagine you'd quickly wear out your crowns and such. As it is, I like mixing a little Listerine or other mouthwash in there to help clean. The tongue cleaner should be classified as torture though."
5,Water pik,Works very well and is far superior to the old one(original). Easy to use and lots of tips from which to choose. Recommended by my dental hygienist.
4,Works Great!,"Item works great. Cleaned out between the teeth as claimed. Add mouthwash and it gives your mouth a nice clean feeling.Only cons? A little noisier than I expected. But I didn't even think of it as making noise, so that's not a huge thing.Splashy. It may just be me and my inability to not make a mess... but unless I completely closed my mouth I splashed water all over.Still love it though! I'm glad I bought it."
3,Waterpik hasn't evolved much,"Although measurements may have been included in product description, I wasn't aware this model would be so compact. I like the smallness of it, but believe it should hold more water. Unlike past Waterpik's, the water runs out before I'd like.WP still has not cured the drip from the handle issue."
3,waterpic,"The ""pic"" performs very good.The water well is skimpy and runs out of water quickly.The cover on the well stores additional items unnecessarilyand is sometimes difficult to put in place."
2,broke after less than 3 months of using,"It really does a great job cleaning, better than the oral-b electronic tooth brush and floss. But it broke after less than three months of usage. The water leaks from the button on the handle, so the water pressure becomes way too low to clean the teeth. I am kind of addicted to the product, because it cleans your teeth very well, but the price would be too high if I had to buy a new one every three months."
4,Good but loud,"My dental hygienist asked me to get one because regular flossing wasn't doing it for me. So I got this, and I must say it works well. In fact, in the beginning I actually looked forward to using it every night because it was actually a enjoyable experience in addition to keeping my mouth clean while effectively removing trapped food. The only thing is how loud it is. In a Brooklyn apartment building, I actually try to use the Water Pik before 10 every night just so I don't wake up the kids next door."
3,I like the older version better,"I find this product ok. The design is neat and easier to store than the older versions but I found the power to be just a little short of the mark. Give it a larger reservoir and some more power and I would consider this water pik perfect, or nearly perfect."
3,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,"Having used Waterpiks before (I grew up using them), I see that the water pressure doesn't seem half as much as it used to. I started out with this one on 10, so there's nowhere to move up to. I like it because it dislodges food that my Sonicare misses and sort of makes up for my relatively rare flossing, and my dentist says that my gums are in good shape. I just wish the pressure were greater. As far as the assorted tips, I don't use any of them other than the general use one. I also wish there were 2 sets for both my husband and me; I don't get what you are supposed to to when there are more than 1 user, wash the tips?"
2,Not performing up to expectations,"I purchased this unit in November 2007. It is now December of the same year and the ""hold"" button will not release after it has been depressed until I turn the unit off. So now when my mouth fills with water, I have to turn the unit off to stop the stream of water, expel the water from my mouth, turn the unit back on and continue in this fashion until finished.The other problem I've noticed is the pressure starts out very weak and usually doesn't build until the water in the tank is about half gone.I expected more from the Waterpik Ultra, but based on it's performance thus far, I would not recommend it."
1,Frustrating experience,"I have contacted WaterPik for a replacement handle three times, and each time the new handle breaks within two weeks. Water leaks (pours!) out of the connecting point between handle and tip, and also at the release button --so much that you lose all pressure. I've spent 12 weeks trying to get a fully functional model, and have given up. I am now returning the whole unit to Amazon, but have had to deal with their ""30 day return policy"" problems to boot. I should have just returned the unit when the first handle gave out. Meanwhile, I picked up a HydroFloss from my dentist today, and it beats the socks off of the WaterPik. A bit noisier, but better built, better jet action, and larger tank capacity."
4,Good Quality,"I have had this Waterpik for a few months now and am quite pleased. I was always curious what using a water flosser would be like and it is quick and very easy. I recommend continuing to floss regularly as well while using this waterpik, but it really does blast things out! This is my first water flosser and it is a very solid unit. I don't have much to compare it to, but it is simple to use and comes with plenty of tips. I saw this same flosser at Target for almost $20 more, so I decided to buy here on Amazon. I have braces and an appliance in my mouth, so it's amazing to see what this thing gets out of my braces and teeth. I highly recommend this product."
2,"This was my 4th -- they worked well, until they all leaked","I love these things, until they leak. The hose cracked on the first three. On the fourth, water poured out of the unit itself, which is not very comforting for an electrical device. I'm going to give Waterpiks a last (5th!) try."
3,"Nice, but!","Waterpik could use more pressure, comes with only one mouth pik & a bunch of useless pik accessories (tongue pik. braces pik, etc.). I'd rather have 4 individual mouth piks & buy the useless accessory pack on my own. It's a way to make you spend more money on something that should have been included (unless your family wants to share one pik). A nice looking unit & does the job, but disappointed with only one single pik."
1,Died after 2 times,"I used this twice. The third time, I turned it on. it did nothing, made no sound. It was completely dead. No way to fix it so sent it back. Got a refund."
2,Water Pic Performance C-,The water pic unit does not prime its small pump very well. One must push down on the plastic water container to get the flow started. The pressure settings are set too low. On my old unit the setting that worked for me was two. The new unit requires a six setting to equal the old unit's performance.
4,Pretty good and refreshing,"This pick is great, it doesn't remove things from my teeth that I didn't know were there, but maybe I just clean my teeth too well before I get there. But, I do love the massaging feel my gums get after using it. Seriously this product makes my teeth happy."
3,It is not for a small bathroom,I bought it on my Doctor's recommendation.But it is a chore to take it out every night & use it.Maybe because I do not have space in my bathroom to leave it outside.
4,awsome value!!,A great product at an amazing price..worth every cent.I would recomend it for everyone who finds flossing exhausting. This works better and faster than flossing. The delivery was a bit slow but worth the wait.Billy carter.
3,Keep your old Waterpik,"I thought that this would be better than one I had from years ago. Yes the new one is quieter but my old one had more forceful jets, and more water capacity. If you have the old cube type and it works keep it. This is not a functional improvement.I'm very disappointed but will keep it as a back up."
3,Useful,"Useful to clean gums; not as high pressured as I would've hoped. Good to use if you have permanent retainer, I suppose."
1,Made in China,"I used my first WaterPik for 7 years and it worked perfectly until it just plain wore out. After 4 uses,this one stopped working, the motor would only buzz. This one was made in China. My first one wasn't. Enough said. Let me pay more for a quality American made product. I will say WaterPik was great about replacing it."
3,One Major Flaw,"The new WP-100 has many improvements over the earlier model, but does have one major flaw that is quite annoying. The water resevoir holds almost 50% less water than the previous model that I had. The Ultra holds 20oz. whereas the previous model held 35oz of water. Because it is so important to message the gums, I need to refill the container in order to do a complete job. My dentist agrees. Refilling the unit does lead to a greater chance of spills and is inconvenient.On the positive side, the WP-100 is much quieter and more compact. The pik fits nicely into the unit and it takes less space on the sink. The water stream also seems more forceful."
2,Great but breaks,"I have had 4, yes, four Waterpik Ultra Water Flossers in the last 4 years.I love using a waterpik but this model breaks easily. I am not typically hard on equipment. My electric toothbrush is three years old.But the Ultra is not durable and I have had to replace it frequently because I can't find a better machine.They last anywhere from six to nine months.What breaks?1) on off switch.2) bracket that holds the handle.3) leaks after short time.4) water force slowly dies and adjusting the dial does not help.5) cover cracks.I use it daily, so perhaps if it is not used so often it would hold up better."
5,Amazing Result,"I bought this product 6 month ago after my dental exam. I had very sensitive gum and it bleeded a lot. After 6 month of use, I renturned to my dentist today. He was amazed by the improvement of my gum. The bleeding was gone.I use brush and Waterpik everyday. Thanks to Waterpik."
5,Very pleased!,"The Waterpik was received on time, well packaged and ready for use. It is easy to go from the package to use with multiple attachments to meet a variety of needs. (At this point I tend to use only 1 attachment, but plan to start ""branching out"" ;) Only complaint, this model requires an outlet so the unit takes up counter space unless you chose to unplug it and store it after each use, which is way too cumbersome for me. Minor issue as I use the product all the time with positive results."
1,bad choice!,"This product does a good job of cleaning, as long as it's working! Mine was about 2 months old when the thumb button--which, when depressed, stops the flow of the water to keep messes to a minimum--became stuck, so no water would flow. It had been an intermittent problem prior to that, but now it is permanently stuck. In trying to get it to release, the entire handle split open--and still the button was stuck down.I had an older Water Pik model before this one, which also quit working after a few months' time. I am looking for a new brand......"
2,"Nice, but still need to floss","I think this is effective as a supplement to flossing, but not as replacement. I think this may depeend on your teeth. I easily get things stuck in my teeth. I'm sure this is cleening under the gums better, but it can't dislodge everything. If you're looking for a replacement for flossing, probably not the way to go, but again, it may depend on your teeth."
4,worth the 45 bucks,"My mouth never felt so clean. It's a little messy to use since your mouth fills up with water over and over, but adding mouthwash is a really refreshing alternative to flossing which typically left my gums aching for hours."
3,Not sure how long this machine will last,"I have used it only for about a week now, and I sense that it doesn't have the strongest motor. I would recommend another model, folks."
3,"use it one year, then the tube leaks...","I have been conscientiously cleaning my teeth and using waterpik ultra. However, its tube starts to leak after one year of usage, at the joint of the tube and the body of the machine. What a pity. I am switching to Hydrofloss now."
5,dental health,This is an excellent product that should be used by everyone. It will prevent you a lot of trips to dentist's office.
4,Waterpik W-100... a solid poduct.,Basically the W-100 does what it is supposed to do. If the tank was a bit bigger and the hose a bit longer I would give it 5 stars. It works great and I would recommend buying it if you are looking for an irrigator.
3,Too many useless features..,"bracket arm broke after 6 months. I should not have used it as leverage to remove resovoir, but ...I did. Other than that...the extra tips are useless."
4,Acceptable,"works well, but as stated by another, it is not as powerful as the older model it is replacing"
3,"It looked great, but it didn't work in Europe.","All in all, it should be a great product. Unfortunately I wanted to use it in Europe. Adaptors and converters did not work, and the device burned out, even though I checked on the internet about using it overseas."
5,Quietest Waterpik Ever!!!,"This is about the quietest Waterpik there is in the market. The previous versions that I had was so noisy, my neighbors knows when I am using it. Control knobs are well-placed and the adjustable jet speed is very useful."
4,flosser,The flosser works well however there are times that it cuts off. I turn it off and re-start it again and it is fine
1,This stopped working after 3 months - I hate it.,The button stuck and it quit working 4 months into it - would never purchase again. It was great for a couple weeks and then the button would stick and the water would not come out. It is too late to return so I am basically out of 40 something dollars.Bonnie
5,Waterpik,"I had never used a waterpik before purchasing this one but I love it! I still like to floss (I know, I'm one of those people who actually LIKE to floss) but the waterpik is great for rinsing my teeth and getting out tonsil rocks (those calcified pieces of food stuck in your tonsils-I only have to do it occasionally but it is the easiest way to remove them!). I imagine that this is the best thing if you don't like to floss and I even bought one for my mom because she does not floss."
5,Bought another one!,"The water pic I purchased for myself works so well, I bought one for a relative....and she also likes it!"
1,not satisfied,"This is the third WaterPik we purchased over the past several years. Each time the hose got brittle and broke into several pieces within a couple of years. Also, customer service is not willing to help with replacements. We will definitely try another brand."
5,Rave review on Waterpik,"I am very glad to finally have a Waterpik that is quiet. I like the looks of it, the storage in the lid, and the ease of using. My last Waterpik was very noisy and the pik was not easy to store on the device. My husband has a new Waterpik exactly like mine for his sink and he is a happy Waterpik user also! The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is truly a great tool. I have not owned it for a long period of time so am hoping that it will give us longer service than the last model. (a different style)"
3,Everything that everyone says it is except my button sticks,"It does what it supposed to but on mine, the button that stops the waterflow sticks when it goes over 4."
3,it strengthens the gum,"During my dental visit it was shown that although I was flossing occasionally, it wasn't enough to prevent bleeding when the dental assistant flossed my teeth. She recommended that perhaps I try a water; and that the results are usually better than flossing, because it strengthens the gum which then prevents the bleeding. Well this has worked."
4,Replaceable batteries Sonicare,I have been using the rechargeable sonicare for years and was a little concerned that maybe this unit would not be as good. I was pleasantly surprised that it has a lot more action than the more expensive rechargeable unit.
2,Over rated,"I bought it because of 1,000 good ratings. Then my dentist told me that manual flossing did a better job, and to use this only as a supplement. I tried the brush and found it nowhere near as good as an Oral B cross battery-powered brush. Since I can't return it (health product), I'll go back to my OralB and manual flossing, and throw this one out. Takes up too much space not to be used. Very disappointed."
4,Great Product! with some drawbacks...,"The waterpik was recommended by my dentist and it seems to work very well. The water pressure is good, but not all the attachments fit as tightly as I would like and leak. It does clean well near the gum line and gets a better job done after brushing. I add mouthwash to the water and it leaves your mouth refreshing. The real proof will be at the next dental cleaning. This is really 3 stars not 4, but the system will not let you correct."
5,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,"Works great, just needed to get used to turning the tip rather than having to twist my arm a little."
1,JUNK -- AVOID WATER PIK,"Other reviews said their Water Pik showed up with problems right out the box. I guess I had to see for myself. I wished I did not. Leaked right out of the box, motor only works sometimes, storage lid for extra tips is junk, keeps opening and spilling contents. Strongly avoid this. This is the second Water Pik that I have purchased and had bad luck with both. JUNK !!!"
1,"2 strikes, you're out","I have actually bought two of these models because I thought that perhaps the first one just had a non-standard flaw (silly me). I bought the second machine after the first one broke because I really like waterpics; they do a great job at cleaning but the flaw is that after about two months of use, the blue button that stops flow constantly jams. Then it began to leak at the point where the nozzle attaches to the handle and would eject the nozzle. Thus the machine would be great if it lasted more than 2 months but since it is not a ""disposable"" machine, it is basically a waste of $50. There is also no way to clean the ""plumbing"" of the machine."
3,good,"Hi - I bought this based on a recommendation from my dentist. They said that on top of brushing and flossing, I needed to use a pick to spray water into my gums. I did this pretty regularly at first but then it just became too much of a pain in the behind. Its very large, very loud, and it makes a giant mess all over the place. Maybe its the conductor, but I haven't used it in months. I do believe its well built, looks nice, but it takes up a lot of real estate. I hope this feedback helps."
2,waterpic customer care and bad products,"The product works good when its new, good product, but when its 2 or 3 tears old and theunit starts to leak then the customer service doesn't want to help you what so ever. theyjust want you to buy more parts for the product, its like it has a built in breakage factor,I had 2 units and the same thing happened to both of them, the first one was getting older soI opted to buy a new unit, the second will get pitched and thats it for me and waterpic junk."
1,Unreliable,"This is my second Waterpik. I bought this second time even after my first product stopped working after one use, due to raving reviews from other customers. My second product stopped working on day 15. I am not sure what's wrong with this. I am returning this and ordering a different product this time."
4,"Not bad at all, Cleans the gums very nicely if you don't like to floss","Overall, I was impressed of this product. It does the job well, the only thing I don't like about it, it is motor/water pump it has in it. The more you raise the speed, it gets loud and shakes the whole stand a bit."
1,terrible quality,"The WaterFlosser stopped working after less than 2 months. Somehow the amazon return window was covering this product for less than 1 month and a half. So the only option I got is to just throw the flooser away, and stop purchasing through the Amazon."
1,Only supports 120 Volts,"It is too bad that this device only supports 120 volts, nowadays all electronics support 120 - 240 Volts.I was going to order three, but unfortunately they are not compatible in my country (I need a transformer)."
5,Excellent,I love this product. I haven't had any issues with it and it has lived up to all my expectations. I would recommend it to anyone..
3,Jury still out,"If this works the way it's supposed to, it's a great product; but I'll have to wait till November to get my dental check-up results. It seems to work pretty good, but there are a couple of small things that could be better: a) the reservoir is a little small and b) the electric cord could've been a bit longer. It takes a while to get used to using it. I just hope my dentist says it works as good as the WaterPik people says it does. I'll let you know in November."
2,It's all hype! No way better than flossing!,"I purchased this product based on the manufacturer's claim that it removes 99% of all plaque along with another claim that it performs better than traditional flossing.Well, if it really truly performs better than flossing, then I shouldn't be able to see anything on a string of floss after using the Waterpik. Wrong! After using the Waterpik at the highest setting, I tested its effectiveness by using floss, and there were enough plaque and debri that the floss picked up AFTER the Waterpik to deem it not adequate. I performed this test multiple times over a 2-week period and got the same results.Just think about it. How can it be possible for a stream of water to reach certain places under the gum line that string floss obviously can? Thus, the claims by Waterpik were all marketing hype!"
5,great product!!,"I just purchased this for my partner for her birthday. Her old one had 'died' and she asked for a replacement as a gift. I went on Amazon (of course) and found a large array of water pics. I purchased one that day, and received it by UPS less than a week later! She was thrilled when she saw it,and even more so when she used it! A great product!!"
4,REFRESHING,"THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT FOR DENTAL WORK LIKE BRIDGES, ETC. BUT CONTRARY TO MY HOPES, I STILL FIND IT NECESSARY TO FLOSS. IT GIVES A REFRESHING FEELING THOUGH."
3,it is not effective,"I almost said ""No"" to recommending this product but I haven't had it long enough to know weather or not it is effective. At first I was excited about hoping not to have to floss anymore but after using, it's really hard to tell whether or not the ultra flosser is actually doing what it's supposed to do."
3,Didn't last long enough to earn a high rating.,"This product served its purpose and served me well with daily use for two and a half years. But now it's developed a crack in the hose near the hand piece. Water squirts out of the crack, rendering the product useless now. I'd expect to get well more than just two or three years of daily use out of a product like this, so I'm dissatisfied. Hence the three out five stars rating, due to mediocre product longevity,"
3,"Worked great for 6 months, then stopped working...needed cleaning.","I used this WaterPik for 6 months without any issues, and then it stopped working. The motor ran, but no water came out. I tried different tips, and the tip was not clogged. I got so frustrated that I took the whole thing apart, and there were no clogs in the line or tank valves. I let a vinegar-water mixture soak through the pump unit, and that seems to have helped, but I would prefer that this issue be addressed in the user's manual (it is not) or that WaterPik provide some easier way to keep the unit running longer than 6 months. I'm on city water, so I assume that my water is not ""hard,"" but who knows...I can't imagine I should be buying bottled water for this thing?!?"
4,waterpik,I have owned this water pik for a year now after replacing their cordless model which is weak compared to this one and limited time on rechargable battery. This product is the best one I found on the home grade market. The only flaw I found is that the hose cracks and the entire handle will need to be replaced after a year of normal use. Luckily the handle can be purchased separately for $15.00
3,It gets messy,"This was also for my son for a gift for Christmas. He said when he used it his mouth felt very clean like just having his teeth professionally cleaned, but the only thing is that it leaked a little bit so you have to be careful. He said it was dripping from the tube, and his pants he had on got soaked. Just be careful to remove every thing from the counter, and have the unit near the sink when you are using it."
5,C&N,"Always enjoy listening to Crosby, Stills, or Nash whether they are together, single, or paired together. Great music from these guys."
4,Pleased with the product however unexpected charge.,"Hello, I am very happy with the product and am currently enjoying watching it however. The product arrived at my house on a saturday. I was at work at the time therefore unable to collect. A charge for 11.95 was left at my door, to pay the price on collection at the post office given. I was shocked at this sudden charge as I was completely unaware of it beforehand. The charge was for 3.95 VAT into the EU and 8.00 for the post office. Upon buying the item from amazon, there was no warning of this charge."
2,dragon ball,"very violent, not just martial arts but guns and knives, execution style shooting . not what I expected. also has a dirty old man who tries to spy on naked young girls"
5,A classic hit,"One of my favorite anime of all time! though it might not be something i recommend for people who don't like any sexual themes at all, it is mostly light hearted and exciting, and i can't get enough! :)"
5,I love this box set.,"This is the best thing ever for Dragonball fans. It has all 31 episodes of season 1. We meet Goku, Bulma, Krillin, Roshi, Yamcha, and Pilaf's gang in season 1. We also get to see Goku's giant ape transformation. Dragonball is lots of fun and a must see for all anime fans. I love that they have remastered this old series. The audio is in 5.1 Dolby Digital surround. It sounds great. It also has a marathon play feature that allows you to skip the annoying opening and closing animations and previews. This set is great."
2,Avoid this book if you're new to AE,Not at all effective if you really need an introduction to this application. Confusing.
5,Delicious!,"This book is an excellent guide to enjoy the best New Orleans has to offer. The restaurants atmosphere, service, price and food was exactly as the book stated. New Orleans has so many choices, this guide sends you to the right choice for every meal."
5,An outstandng concert,"This was an outstanding concert. The selections were varied, and the orchestra and all the soloists were outstanding. Although it included several compositions I don't like, I even found them very enjoyable."
3,Yeah...... you can have it......,You can have it. But you won't watch it more than three times. The best is Mischa Maisky. He's very good.Netrebko is good.Hvorostovsky is disappointing.I was disappointed with the outcome. I was really expecting more.
3,Video game.,"This video game is a little difficult,but great for boys. It has a lot of battle scenes in it. I havn't played it so really can't give a good review."
5,Always Come Back to It,"I have been reading Tarot for over 15 years, and although I have read many other books, this is the one I consistently refer to. It has an excellent reference for the symbolism in the Rider-Waite deck, especially the Major Arcana. If you want to learn to read without constantly referring to a book, this is the study aid to get!My copy is lovingly tattered and worn, and when I finally lose one of the pages that have torn loose, it may be time for replacement. But, until then . . .Highly recommended for both the Novitiate and Experienced Reader. Also recommed the Connelly ""Handbook for the Apprentice"" for its study guides and meditations. A little too Christian bent for me, but it works."
2,LSS - The book does not marry them right.,"I have read great books about Lean, classics like The Machine that Changed the World, The Toyota Way, Lean Thinking, etc., but this book fails to reach Lean's basics. The author approaches the subject without letting the reader grasp the Lean approach.The Six Sigma side of the book idolizes black belts and focuses strictly on ROIC (return of invested capital), which may be short sighted on long term effects.Lean Six Sigma is a powerful approach and can produce amazing results, but the book does not marry them right."
4,A Book to start.,"The book is good to understand how the lean sigma works and what the companies need to do to have an efective lean sigma program. I'm working at a french company that is implementig the WCM (another name to lean manufacturing) and I'm living the dificulties that Michael George wrote in the book, main because the program don't have a leader but a lot of leaders in each SBU. To discovey what is happen im my company just read the first pages of the book. The other side if you would like how to support your company to implement the lean sigma this book is a good star."
5,Very close but not that voice.,"I STARTED TO LISTEN THEM 11 YEARS AGO. I STILL DO.WHEN ""THAT"" HAPPEND - I STOPED. I DON'T KNOW WHY.I VERY APPRECIATE THE PEOPLE WHO CONTINUED. AND I VERY APPRECIATE THE PEOPLE WHO DID THIS RECORD.THANK YOU. WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND.YOUR GRUNGE (KASYANOV YOURI)"
3,OK,This filter is bigger than it looks. It says it's for 1 gallon fishbowls/tanks but I would think this would fit a 3 gallon or bigger. I'm going to send it back because I expected a very small version. Otherwise it works great just not the size it looks like.
2,"No instructions, confusing","I bought this because it was cheap and didn't seem to require anything active (pump, bubbler, etc.). But I think I was mislead or confused since there were no instructions with the filter. It must require a pump to push the water up through the filter...because otherwise it does nothing. Perhaps to an experienced fish tank owner that's an obvious requirement for this product, but should be specified. Since it's for a fish bowl, it seems that more clear instructions are needed since people with bowls *generally* seem to be folks who are just starting out with fish, as was my case."
2,Unhappy!,"The quality of this product seems good enough but we thought we were getting an ottoman that matches the Strathwood St. Thomas patio furniture that we ordered. When the ottoman arrived we discovered the finish does not match the other furniture, nor does the color of the cushion. Very disappointed, as this was listed in the group of options to add to the St. Thomas furniture. Buyer beware! Discovered too late that this ottoman & the nesting tables are part of the Falkner style furniture by Strathwood. We're thinking of returning this & the nesting tables. Frustrating to say the least. Amazon, can't you offer the same ottoman & tables in the St. Thomas finish?"
4,Good stuff...,Bought this travel pack a few months ago... but was only able to use it to its potential last weekend...fits a lot of stuff in there.. and the side opening makes it easier to pack and unpack stuff..the cushioning on the back is good...Its good to put in a couple of days stuff...the only negative abt it.. after completely stuffing it.. the balance on the bag was not absolutely vertical causing me to bend forwards a little bit to negate the effect..
4,Second Album a success,"so its Ademas second time around with the whole music thing and I gotta say they did one hell of a job. Like most sophomore albums it sounds more grown up and lyrically better but musically I gotta say theres not as much veriaty. On their first albums I liked alot of the openings in songs like ""Everyone"" and ""Giving In"" but they couldnt make the second one exactly like the first one. My favorite songs include Co-Dependent (good opening song), Stand Up (awesome song, good message) and Do you Hear Me (very good aswell)"
1,Terrible,"What can I say this cd just flat out sucks. Im sure the only way these guys got any attention in the first place was because of the lead singers relationship to Jon Davis. The lead singer, Mark or whatever is an absolute terrible writer. It shows on the entire cd with weak lyrics. Id say some of the dumbest lyrics ive ever heard. The songs are very mainstream and poppy. Sure it may be considered ""nu metal"", but id say alternative rock is just as good. There are a countless number of bands way better than these goons, Glassjaw and The Blood Brothers to name a few. But if you like a bunch of idiots trying to sell records on image then go ahead and waste 15 bucks."
3,Some hit some miss,"It has some good tracks, good beats, but they need to work on their lyrics. Plus they have a song about abusive boyfriends which has been done to death(nickleback,saliva). Definitly listen to the cd if you can before you buy."
2,One hit wonder.,"This CD is completely pushed by the song, ""Unstable"". All other songs are blander, mainstream-ish types, and the other track, ""Immortal"", is a lyrical disaster. I mean, it is simply repeating ""You can't kill me, I'm immortal."" - Like it's a revelation to people, that the word ""Immortal"" means unable to be killed. Overall, this CD is only good for that one song. If you have an Ipod, Buy the track, if not, simply disregard the rest."
3,Rain Water Shower Head,"This shower head would be fine if mounted so that the water drops straight down. Mounted at an angle like a standard shower head will not be satisfactory for most people. Mounted at an angle the water appears to fall off even if the water pressure is at 60 PSI. We returned it because it didn't perform the way we expected. We purchased a Moen shower head that was big like this, but had what they called ""Immersion Technology"". It performed great even mounted at an angle."
1,Misleading product specifications,"Bought this shower head for its ""pause"" function, in order to be able to turn off the flow of water and save on water consumption. The pause function of this product doesn't actually pause the flow of water, it only slightly reduces it. This product simply didn't delivered what it claimed it would. Will never buy another product from Waterpik again."
5,Excellent! Just what you've been waiting for!,"Someone finally got it right.This is the March 27, 1965 Wes Montgomery Paris concert. The sound quality is excellent! All personal, venue, and date information is accurate. The booklet is informative. For some reason ""Jingles"" is titled ""Mr. Walker."" The only thing bad about this release is that some of the songs from the concert are missing, probably due to CD length restrictions."
2,"Beautiful shoe, but not comfortable","These are a beautiful pair of shoes, but they had to go back....they were just not comfortable. Very tight in the toe area....so sad to see them go back!"
3,not a classic but worth watching,Very enjoyable film that actually managed to surprise me. Manages to go a bit beyond the standard hitman fare. What did it for me most of all though was the ending which I won't spoil.
4,Funny,"James Belushi and Sheryl Lee are quite good in their roles. The movie is an action comedy, and there are a lot of funny moments. The story is funny and unpredictable in the end, James Belushi is hilarious and Sheryl Lee is the film`s main atraction, she`s prouving here that she`s a talented actress without taking her dress off. And the end of the film is taking you by surprise."
4,"Good, but mainstreamish","They have a great sound don't get me wrong and i own the cd, saw them in concert, but they are very mainstream, they do sound a lot like the old ataris, but seem very nfg. I haven't desided whether or not that is bad though. Nfg was only popular for a little bit, but still they bit ass. Cauterize definetly have a good sound, and i really enjoy the cd, but they wont be a four cord wonder. Their songs have a unique ring to them, but they all are very similar in context, and i'm as emo as the next emo kid, but you cant be broken hearted all the time. despite the afore mentioned criticizms i really enjoy the album, but i recomend fall out boy to someone who is emo with a mean streak they're good. but like cauterize their songs are mainly about heartbreak, and revenge."
3,Decent,"This vest is a fairly decent buy if you just want something in which you can carry a pistol and a few magazines for it and a rifle(though only a few different styles of magazine actually fit into the pouches on the vest). The overall quality of the vest isn't horrible, but it isn't that great either. It's difficult to adjust the fit and once adjusted it's less comfortable to wear. Overall, not a bad buy, but I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Not quite nutritionally sound,"The book looks thorough enough. It looks well-researched and seems to have some great menus put together that are nutritionally sound. My husband followed the diet to a T. And yes, two days into the diet, he noticed about a pound come off and had more energy.Unfortunately, three days into the diet, my husband began having charlie horse-like spasms all over his body. The book fails to take into account that not all sodium is bad for you, and that your body requires at least some sodium to function properly. After three days, my husband stopped this diet and reverted toThe Zone: A Dietary Road Map to Lose Weight Permanently : Reset Your Genetic Code : Prevent Disease : Achieve Maximum Physical Performance, which works much better, is suited for long-term use, and is nutritionally balanced."
5,What a smart man!,"I see the other reviews and I say the same thing. If you get the kit, and listen to the tapes. You will lose weight. I was 365 and lost 60lbs in less then 3 months. I have a lot more to lose. But if your so heavy you can't do work outs. Even when you try to walk - You leg starts to swell. And your doctor agrees- you need to lose some weight before you can do anything. Because you could have a heart attack. This is the diet. You eat real food. But you must eat. A heavy person is not heavy because of eating to much. Its the right foods and to eat. Don't skip meals. As for the blue print. When you see your doctor. He can tell you were your problem spots are growing. So you can get the right diet. Michael has done so much for my life. I don't have to cry every night because my legs or my sugar is threw the ceiling. I am feeling like a person now. If you need to lose weight now. Read it, do it. Do it for your self."
1,very cheesy.,this book is basically a stretched out version of a simple diet with no real variation for several different body types and no new information. Finished reading it in 45 minutes. Didn't like it.
5,It Works!,"I'm writing this on day 6 of the 6 day body makeover. I lost 5 pounds! I didn't expect to loose so much because I'm not that much over weight, in fact five pounds was my goal! I'm going to Hawaii in two weeks and wanted to be swim suit ready. This way of eating is very foreign to me because two servings of meat a day is my usual max. I stuck to it though and now jeans that were too tight last week fit again. My stomach is flatter than it has been in a long time. This diet rocks! p.s I'm over 40 and loosing weight wasn't easy anymore, until now!!!!!"
3,"A good program, but the food is very boring...","I am a huge fan of Michael Thurmond and have a great deal of respect for him. I have started the 6-day program four times, and each time I only make it to the third or fourth day. Why? Because it is just sooooo tiring having chicken in the morning, chicken for lunch, chicken in the afternoon and chicken for dinner. You are constantly eating rice and vegetables too. You'll find that unless you get very creative, you'll be eating the same food over and over and over again. It is very difficult to stick to a program when you don't enjoy the food you eat. It was hard for me to enjoy my meals & snacks because I was just so tired of eating the same things day in and out. If you can get creative and try to vary the meals, I think it will work better. This system DOES work. However, it is difficult in that most days you eat the same things."
1,Tracii Guns - Killing Machine,This is the worst CD i think that I have ever heard. For starters it sounds as if there singing into a tin can. If you are a L.A. Guns fan and expecting it 2 sound like them trust me it don't. i'm glad I only paid a penny for this album the 2.98 for shipping was not worth the money don't waste your time with this product just listening to it is a waste of time you would be better off sticking with an L.A. Guns album because any solo effort from any member of this band sucks
4,seems like it will be good ...,Product arrived on time in good condition. It is for my 12 year old daughter in preparation for her 13th birthday. Thank you!
1,"too small for garden flag, looks cheap","i opened the box that was delivered and immediately went online to return it. it is much smaller than standard garden flags, and looks cheap."
2,Plastic clips broke,"After only 3 or 4 trips on the boat, the plastic clips holding the door shut broke. In addition, a third piece of plastic broke at the bottom of the door. My husband was absolutely disgusted and so am I, especially after spending the money that I did. It has been a complete disappointment. Apparently this was not an isolated occurrence."
5,Like a brick in the face... and I mean that in a good way.,"Oh, my. I just finished reading this book not more than 10 minutes ago. As a devoted follower of the series I own all the previous books and have read and reread them over and over. I was, of course, anticipating this book, but I was unprepared for the absolute intensity that it hit me with. So much hit the fan, so much was concluded and explained, so much action and emotion that I cursed myself for not being able to read it faster, and find out what happened next. You will scream in frustration. You will be left crying like a little baby, pleading for more; not so much because you want to know what happens next, but because you crave Katherine A. Applegate's written embrace to wrap yourself up in once again, now blindlly trusting her to satisfy."
1,"Creationist point of view: a very annoying, unreadable style","This is not a review of the actual content. This review is based strictly on the National Enquirer-style of type set, which made this book unreadable for me. At least one-third of it is either bolded, italicized, or underlined. I tried to read it anyway, but got the impression the author felt I was too stupid to decide what was important, so was leading me around by the literary nose, hence the font style. Further, everything was so crammed together, it was difficult to see where one topic ended and another started. I bought this book based on two enthusiastic recommendations. The style was so juvenile, however, that I would be embarrassed to hand this to a non-Christian trying to get a view of creation science. TryGenesis Floodby Dr John Whitcomb orIn the Beginning: Compelling Evidence for Creation and the Flood (7th Edition)by Dr Walt Brown instead."
4,Another fractured fairy tale,"There's a big penchant these days to re-tell fairy tales. Grimm wrote 'em one way (usually, grim!), Disney disnified them, then today's authors reality them up again.This is a twist on cinderella. The story itself is the story of the rat who was turned into a page-boy for the would-be princess. He's a boy now, but, he was a rat.It's also the story of society. From civil service units that are anytyhing but civil to tabloid journalism at its yellowist, we see the nasty side of society as it turns this innocent yet rat-like child into a ""monster"".The language may be a bit confusing for some young readers, but in all, I think it's a great fit for the age group. There's lots of tension, but no real threat. And, there's a fairy tale ending.(*)>"
3,Not Bad,It was really something I enjoyed learning about Japan and something to see and maybe visit when you travel to Japan. Living treasures of Japan Im amazed.
4,good value,"This thing fit just fine on a '77 Chevy truck bench seat with no headrest. Easy to install, but having a person help you is good."
1,porrly made,"This cover fit ok but all the ties were torn or poorly sewn, some even looked shreaded. Had my wife re sew but fabric tore while installing. Its crap"
2,funky,"Fits very oddly, securing straps tore right from fabric right from the get go. Would not buy again. Fits snug it spots and lose in others."
5,Totally Hypnotic,"This CD will take you away from everything. I have never heard such awesome connected sounds and rhythms that make you feel as if you are in a dreamland. I agree with one reviewer that it is hard to believe that this is their first album. I am already looking forward to their second, third, etc. This is a CD that you can listen to over and over again without feeling that each song sounds exactly the same."
2,Great for inspiration. But too many errors!,The photography is beautiful and the ideas of the book good. But so far all the baking recipes have been off on liquids and time! And when I check the ingredients through a calorie calculator the fat and calories that Neff supplies for the recipes are not always correct. I still love the book for the inspiration it provides. And I know enough about cooking and baking to adjust for the mistakes in the recipes. But I do not recommend this book for any novice cook.
1,awesoome cleaner/horrible deal,"Honeysuckle is my favorite Mrs. Meyers' scent. A few years ago it was available in a mini kit. I am thrilled to see it again (and in larger bottles.) I got a shipment today from another popular site, but came here looking for a deal on a bulk shipment. Here they are 3 for $30...$10 each! They are just under $6 on that other site. 6 for $30 would be a good deal, but this is a total rip-off!"
2,"cute toy, stopped working","My son loved this toy when he got it less than a year ago. I agree the battery life is terrible. Even worse, it stopped working completely in less than a year. :("
4,A book about Steve Jobs,"It is non-sense to write, as the reviewer put it, that Owens is a hybrid between Gates and Gatsby. He is a real guy, and his name is Steve Jobs. If you like reading about Steve as I do, I suggest you buy the book. In addition to the guy saying Simpson stole from Guy Gawasaki, let me reassure, you: basically 90% of the phrases coming out of Owens' mouth are from Steve Jobs. Most of them you can find in several interviews. Even Lisa, Steve's daughter, acknowledges it in one of her articles at the Harvard school of journalism."
4,A Regular Guy,"I first read Mona Simpson's ANYWHERE BUT HERE, and found her writing intimate, touching and creative. She is a great character builder and she has a respect for the reader. She challenges us to be present by bringing us back in time with her characters and then putting us in the present. I loved ANYWHERE BUT HERE and found that A REGULAR GUY brought back some of the same themes and characters albeit with different names and locations. Simpson is very focused on the ""father"" as missing and the impact of that missing link on the family."
2,"NOVELS ARE BY DEFINITION, FICTION!","Ms. Simpson has a very loose definition of ""fiction"". I enjoyed the story for what it is-- a slightly fictionalized account of events in her brother Steve's life.I had heard good things about Simpson, but her narrative's jittery timeline and two dimensional supporting cast left much to be desired."
1,BAD,"There is nothing good to say about this production....the acting is poor; the audio is bad; the singing is spotty, not helped by the lousy sound."
4,The way Supertramp should sound now,"It was even more obvious after listening to this album on how much of an influence Rodger had on Supertramp...even on music he did not write. More importantly, I now more than ever want to see this man in concert. I felt a certain familiarity with the songs i did not know, like Every trick in the book. If you want to listen to songs that reminded you of Supertramp's best period, buy this album."
2,Only barely related to Math,"I was hoping that this would be a good introduction to math concepts for children. After all, that's how the book is marketed. I found that it is only loosely tied to math concepts and it was the same concept repeated with each fable. There are a number of animals working on a project and a subset of the group works on one portion of the project and a subset work on another part until the project is complete. The only change is the numbers used in each project. I also wasn't anticipating interwoven religious concepts and that was frustrating as this is not marketed as such. In the end I threw it away."
5,Quantative Value of Numbers,"Math Fables by Greg Tang is a great book to help kids understand the quantative value of numbers as opposed to just the sequential place of numbers (i.e. 1,2,3,. . .). My 2 grandsons look at numbers differently now. This book took some of the mystery away - they get it. They understand that 5 is 5-ones, or can be 2 groupings of numbers such as 1 and 4, 2 and 3. . .1+4, 2+3. Since we use math everyday in numerous ways, it's good to keep young minds open to explore numbers. Knowledge of how numbers work help to keep learning blocks at bay."
4,"This book was good, but not the best of the series","I sort-of liked this book.It concludes the ""Alien Aventures"" series.In it, Rod`s father and mother finally meet again and Madame Pong, Snout, Espleth and Rod (sharing seymour`s body) go to the weeping forests of Krydrmar, and finally bring BKR* to justice.*Pronuoced Bee Kae Are"
1,Didn't fit lamp,"Although this is the same item number as the burned-out bulb in our lamp, it didn't fit into the slot just right and didn't work. Very disappointing."
2,not for my vehicle,"These were listed as correct for my Dodge Durango, but didn't meet the need. Within a couple of months they were leaking and soon failed completely."
4,Not quite what was expected - but fine if they described it better,"I saw this was a ""border"", so I thought it might come on a roll as one piece. However, it is 12 pieces, each about 36"" long. It was fine, though - very nice."
2,It never rocks...,"I've listened to Lili's first self-titled album a number of times. I've pin-pointed my favorite parts to the bridge in ""Real"" and the intro to ""Baby."" These parts are two of the best electric violin performances I've ever heard, full of distortion and wah-pedal used with a full understanding of how they work with a violin. This album has no such parts. If you want a CD that has that style of effects-laden string music, before recommending this album I would sooner point you artists such as Rasputina, Apocalyptica, Martyn Bennett, and Ritsu Katsumata.This album sounds too much like that uninspired Bond crap that sells too well."
1,unusable-waste of money,not happy-stuff was totally dried out and unusable It was a waste of money and I will not be purchasing it again
2,T. Rex - 'There Was A Time' (Captain Trip),"Japanese label Captain Trip, as many of you know tend to release plenty of hard-to-find and obscure titles that would likely otherwise remain unavailable. This T. Rex rarity is an unreleased archive gig from their VERY first live concert performance {as a duo - Marc Bolan and Steve Peregrine Took}. Took place on September 23, 1967 at the semi-famed Middle Earth Club. Reason I'm giving this CD a two-star rating is because of it's poor sound quality, YET most of the lyrics here are somewhat understandable. If anyone ever COULD clean up the sound and reissue this disc, that would be great. My guess is that whoever discovered this archive on an aging cassette, likely did their best they could to make it sound as 'decent as possible'. Definitely for die-hards and completists."
4,The Universal Problem. . . .,"I found this book very funny and entertaining. It really kept me guessing until the end (and that's hard to say about many mysteries these days). I like the characters' dry, wry senses of humor.The story was very well-crafted up until the end, where the solution is sort of dumped on the reader with lots of side explanation to make it seem more believable. It was a bit on the far-fetched side, and in a weak sort of way.Overall, though, this is a thoroughly enjoyable read."
5,Best colored pens I've ever used,I don't use anything but Bic Z4 Roller Classic pens when I'm journaling in color.
1,Save your money!,"We bought this to use for scanning ISBN bar codes on books--what a disappointment! It won't read any bar codes which aren't PERFECT (that is, black ink on a clear background). Scanning over colored paper, through clear wrappers, or faded items simply WON'T work. Even perfect bar codes need several attempts. We have the Socket Scan 5P, and that works GREAT on all kinds of media and poor conditions. This one is nothing but frustration. Spend the money on the higher end model. It's worth it!"
3,"Middlin' good, no Pulitzers","For what it is it's okay, but it isn't very informative about the WITSEC. It's basically a true crime style, personal perspective paperback. For that, fine, at least it's partly written by the guy who got things started up. But it'll never make wiki, and it isn't as readable as McGinniss or Bugliosi or Rule. Book sale, sure. Hardcover full price...no. You'll know a lot more about WITSEC after you're done reading it, but you won't know a lot."
5,a classic,Its a great book. Has lots of information. I have been wanting to read it for a long time and was glad i did.
3,I don't think so,"This way of life is not for me and I admit it right up front. 'The Good Life' does some mandatory chest-thumping and has more detail on building a fence or a wood shed than I'll ever need (I hope). Still, I kept on with the book 'til the end.More than anything, I found myself feeling sorry for Helen Nearing. I know she supposedly went along with this way of life willingly, but if you read between the lines, you'll find Scott Nearing self-righteous, overbearing, a pretty bad host to company and not much fun at parties.On the other hand, if you want someone to build you a fence and throw you a handful of granola, he's your man."
5,Best book on improving flexibility that I own,"I have some flexibility books, and I think this one is the best. The descriptions of all stretches are very detailed. For each of them there are good photographs (not only the final positions) and for most there are alternatives depending on your current flexibility and physical proportions. In no other stretching book have I seen such attention to detail as in this one.If your goal is to improve general flexibility I would definitely recommend this book. If the reason you considered acquiring it is to help with back or neck pain, I would recommend instead ""Overcome Neck & Back Pain"" by the same author (several specific stretching and strengthening exercises for that conditions and also a very good self-diagnosis chapter on the possible causes of the pain.)"
5,Great Read,One of my all time favorite books. I could NOT put this book down. The writing is not the best but the story line is so intriguing and just makes you stop doing everything else to finish this book.I have recommended it to ALL my girlfriends !!!!
2,Good voice...okay music,"I agree with another reviewer: this CD isn't worth writing home about. Anthony has a good voice and with the exception of Charlene and Where I come from, the other songs fade into boring Muzik for me. I've tried several times to get into this Cd, each time, it becomes nothing more that white noise."
2,Overhyped,"I bought this CD mainly from the other reviews here on this page and pre-release press hype. That's why I was compelled to write my own review to offer a dissenting view. While Mr. Hamilton has talent and surely shows promise this record leaves a lot to be desired. His vocals are killer but the songs are filler and the production, which Jermaine Dupree puts his name on as Executive Producer, is truly horrible. It sounds like it was recorded and mixed in a basement and the mastering didn't help either. Harsh frequencies abound and some mixes sound thrown together in haste. Possibly this album was done in a project studio and simply put out without the benefit of another set of ears. I will look forward to his next album to see how he's grown but I sure wish the record label put a little more time into this one."
4,Good CD,"Anthony H has a good CD, I wish he would have been a little more versatile, but R & B needs talent like him. The following songs are nice classic soul: Charlene, I Tried, Better Days. And don't think I slept on the fact that he flipped that remake of ""Lucille"""
2,fair,tape did not play well.....gaps in playing. Consistent uninterruped playing did not occur until restarted cd several times(more than three).
4,I woke up,"It took some convincing for me to finally sit down and absorb this man's flow. I wasn't immediately feeling ""Coming from where I'm from"" or the acoustic version of ""Cornbread, Fish and Collard Greens"" that VH1 Soul played every day. So, I simply wrote this artist off. I stand corrected. ""Charlene"" played on the radio one day and I budged a little, but when a friend played ""Since I Seen't You"" for me I was moved! I'm feeling every track on here except ""Chyna Black""- I don't know where he was going with that one. However, all is made up with tracks like the sensual ""Float"" and the romantic ""My First Love"". Give it a try, this one is a keeper."
1,Another salvo fired at consumers by the recording industry.,"Never mind that the tracks are the typical uninspired cookie-cutter ""soulful"" pap that's being served up by tens if not hundreds of other artists...The big reason to avoid this CD is its copy protection. You WILL have problems playing this in your car. You WILL have problems playing it on high-end CD players. You WILL have problems playing it on a non-Windows computer. Why bother?Incidentally, if you buy this and the place you buy it from says that it's a ""Compact Disc"", return it. They are required by law (at least in the US and Canada) to accept it for a full refund. It does not comply with Philips' Red Book Audio CD standards and CANNOT be called a Compact Disc."
4,"Maybe not a literary masterpiece, but a good read","I found this book to be very interesting and helpful in understanding where John Newton came from and what led to his conversion. For me, it read like a ""Movie of the Week"" script from start to finish. I could visualize it on a movie screen. I have recommended this book to many people. I found it very compelling. I'm not a literary critic, and don't read many novels or biographies, but I enjoyed this book and have been inspired by it."
4,truly beautiful,"this album is quiet and straitforward-no gimmicks, not a lot of weird plugins and drilling beats. and absolutely no distortion. this is much in the vein of global goon, another artist on rephlex. but dont be fooled by its simplicity-it allows the subtleties their space. this is music that will put you in a mood, and its purpose is not to push the boundaries of electronic sound. the synth programming is top notch and cylob can evoke some extremely pleasing sounds out of some analog waveforms. listen to this album a few times and you will realize that this music is absolutely beautiful. a must have for any self-respecting rephlex fan."
4,sounds a little bit like certain tunes from AFX:HAB,"This is a bit less experimental than the other things Cylob have done.. without trying to be catchy as hell like the latter ""Rewind""-single. In comparison.. quite easy and nice listening with certain moments remainding of the beautiful melodies in label-mate aphex twin/AFX's unfortunately out-of-print and never-availible-on-CD ""Hangable Auto Bulb EP (I & II)."
2,Product pictures are not at all accurate,"Unless you like advertising for fizik 100 times on your bar, this bar tape is not for you. The pictures fail to convey that the tape has fizik fizik fizik fizik fizik fizik fizik fizik fizik fizik fizik fizik written all along the sides. Ugh."
1,Not buying again,Had only 4 wks......poss. washed 2x (and hung dry) and underwire is coming out of side and poking me!
3,"The Sunny, the Wacky, the Winning","Dr. Charlie Moore's winning and wacky personality is the real subject of this book of essays. Don't be put off by the notion that this book is about plastic surgery. It's about a sunny, semi-serious way of looking at life and the world by a guy who has enjoyed it all---or MOSTLY all."
2,Rambling and struggling too hard to impress,"Is this book interesting? Well yes, this is an interesting topic, and the author covers lot's of ground, and obviously knows a great deal about the history of science; in particular physical science.However, the first 200 pages killed the curiosity of this reader - I have a clear feeling it was more important to the author to impress me than to educate me. I do not need to have every scientist living between 1600 and 1900 mentioned (or know that the author knows about them) - I need just fifty pages background to develop the ideas we are to discuss later. After 200 pages I was totally exhausted and bored."
4,Good purchase,"We bought this for our 2 1/2 year old boy. He loves it. The controls are very simple and easy to use. The only thing I have to say negative is the controls don't stay secured to the back of the car for storage. The batteries last quit a while. The range on the remote is about 10 - 15 feet. Not a great range, but my son usually follows the car around any way so it is not an issue for him. Overall I would buy it again."
1,Not as described or pictured,"This picture shows a beautiful, shimmering bedskirt, but when I received mine it was thin cotton, no shimmer, and double-layered so it wasn't even see-through at all! Don't buy it - seriously."
3,Well made film with fine acting...story line a little thin and gratuitous.,"Kudos to production company on final product...making more out of a simple story line - drugs, bad guys (and girl), and what people will do for love.. Very good cast and crew that brought you into a different world...setting, imagery and emotions were all well crafted."
2,Pretty much a film I'll never remember,"This is one of those films you see and then promptly forget. Not only does the casting of Blake Lively ruin any hope for watchability (with a grating narration from her throughout), most if not all of the other cartoon characters in it are laughable and/or pitiful."
4,Entertaining,It's what you'd expect from Oliver Stone; violent & well done with a great cast. I enjoyed watching it a lot.
2,Del Toro is always good,"OK story, Del Toro is always great! Salma Hayek is really good as the head of the Cartel. Typical Oliver Stone story kind of falls flat like he doesn't know how to end a story."
5,Good Movie,"I enjoyed Savages very much because it was action-packed. The women in this movie were strong characters, and Salma Hayek was stupendous as always."
4,VIOLENT,"THIS MOVIE WAS RECOMMENDED BY A FRIEND. HOWEVER IT WAS A LITTLE TOO VIOLENT FOR OUR TASTES, BUT WELL MADE."
2,Tries to hard to be hip...,"Think of pulp fiction, less than zero, swordfish, and Beach all mixed together into one. Trying to compete with anyone of those great films (OK swordfish was not great) is a giant risk, but trying to be all of them is, well, not really doable. Now the movie itself. cliche, predictable and unauthentic. The film puts too much weight on the characters and they all become larger than life, with a modern cutesiness that makes you cringe. The idea that these heartless murderers are quirky and likeable just like me and you is deeply flawed and it doesn't work on screen. Finally the narration by the girl throughout starts off well, but as you get to know her character on screen, her narrative doesn't match her personality at all. It becomes annoying to hear her voice after a while.There are beautiful people, soft porn moments, and some funny lines and situations, that make it bareable to watch, but this is no classic."
3,It was OK...had potential,"it had potential but the ending sucks, the acting by benecio del toro was some what comical for some reason dont know if that was intended, if it had a better storyline and a good ending, i would have gave it 5 stars, i love drug movies"
4,Great movie,"This does have some parts where you think to yourself that we're obviously not in reality, but aside from that a great flick."
2,Oliver Stone needs to update his style,"I really wanted to love this movie. I love Selma & Benecio (sp?) but Oliver needs to update, I felt like I was watching a softer version of ""Natural Born Killers"" except I was bored to death. The sex sings were typical, not that I care, and the script wasn't very original... Maybe Oliver's time has come & gone?"
3,"interesting story, not suspenseful","the acting was good, but as an action movie, there was very little suspense. The plot was interesting, but not too believable."
3,Almost a great movie,"the chick is annoying...It would be a much better story if someone else narrated, but still a decent story though."
5,Great Movie,"It was fast-paced, and kept my mind wondering what would happen next. Overall, I loved it, and would definitely recommend it to friends!"
2,Savages,The previews to the movie were better than the actual movie. I'm not really for sure if the movie directors are running out of ideas or if all the good actors are old n dead. The begining of the movie was like a soft three way porn and after the girl got kidnapped it was like a rehabilitation session for both ends. Stupid movie
2,Fails on many levels...,"Nothing in this movie works...the sexual aspects are really awful not in so much the acts, but rather their total lack of relevance to the film. Surprisingly the action is almost non-existent in this film. The story line is just terrible as well.Only reason this film is getting two stars from me is because I watched the entire length of it...I reserve the one star ratings for films that I can't even finish.Pretty much standard Hollywood trash, don't waste your money on this movie!"
5,brilliant,saw it in the theaters and enjyed it so when it got here i decided to watch the special features first & enjoyed myself. great movie
3,"Worth a watch, by yourself.","Huge Tarantino fan. This movie is not only sort of aimless and amoral, but also lacks humor and has very little redeeming quality unless you like to smoke weed and watch Attractive people mostly naked, and some people who used to be attractive, who now are not, and endless violent scenes with little purpose. Now, I'm a fan of all of these things to some degree, I just like to have some type of cohesion. This would be a great movie to have on with the sound turned down, at a party, where everyone is getting wasted."
4,Marijuana version of Johnny Depp's BLOW,"I liked the movie for what it was. Reminded me alot of ""Blow"" and I loved that movie. Drug selling situation gone array."
3,Would like to see film and rate this properly...,"...but I haven't seen it yet. I'd like to know what makes this movie so much better than the rest of the new releases, that is can't be rented, only a digital copy sold at 18 bucks? Seriously, I don't understand why some movies you can rent, and some you have to buy. The digital format is already there, so why can't they all be rentals? I also can't relate to those buy movies never having seen them before. I would think that you'd have to know for sure if it's worth owning, which would requiring see it first. That is my own personal policy at least. If I haven't already seen it in the theater, I rent it before buying it. I need to know it's something worthy of watching multiple times before committing to a purchase. Please give people the option of renting or buying when the films are released to the home viewing market."
3,was expecting more,abd didn't get it...this movie had some really good looking people in it..and that about sums it up...the premiss was good..the execution stunk...
4,Olive Stone at His Best,Savages is a brutally entertaining story about a drug cartel from Mexico imposing its will on independent pot produces in California. The acting is great and the scenes of violence and brutality are horrifically portrayed.
4,Exciting plot with great cast,"Although it's a VERY adult story with subject matter to match, the nudity is not Blake Lively's. The new presentation of Kick-Ass' Aaron Johnson is really cool. I actually love him in this. And can't lose with Taylor Kitsch."
5,Cool Movie,"This movie was interesting, worth watching! I found the story line to be full of things that make you really think."
1,Waste of time,This movie was a huge disappointment. The acting was horrible and the characters were unsympathetic. One of the worst films I have seen in a while.
2,Meh,"The movie's premise is sound and topical enough with the current cartel violence in Mexico spilling over into the US. Plot details are available in the other reviews, so I'll share general thoughts. About half way through I kept watching because I was invested, but had pretty much lost interest. All the performances were good, but the poor writing and length of the movie began to make the whole thing redundant. Opening a film with a character saying ""I may or may not be dead"" indicates a weakness in the writing since you see things in the movies and shouldn't need a character telling you what to think. The ending(s) were a poor attempt to tie up all the threads, and having two once more shows poor writing, masquerading here as ""cleverness."" If you liked ""Traffic,"" a far better movie, you'll find this interesting but won't want to see it again and probably won't think about it after you pop the disc from the player."
4,Watchab;e,"If you have spare time, go ahead and watch this movie. The characters are cool! I liked Selma Hayek very much."
2,Gross,"This movie was just to gory for me. I watched it because it has a story line different from anything I had ever seen and it was just to much for me. Pretty people in the movie though, until there eyeballs are hanging out of there eye sockets."
2,It's really less than 2 stars but.............,"Selma was the only reason I give it 2 stars. There are Countless reasons why this movie sucks and with the caliber of stars in this epic piece of junk I would have the blame the editor. Can't fathom that any of the actors would cosign on this garbage. I lost 2 hours of my life that I can never get back, I just kept watching hoping it would get better but it did not, kinda like Catwoman. Can someone please tell Blake to take the cotton balls out of her mouth, I could barely understand what she was saying in the movie just as on Gossip Girl. The trailer looked awesome, so thankful I didn't waste $ and go to the movies for this one."
2,Director Has Potential,"If I had to guess, I would say that the director of this film is some young hotshot on the Hollywood scene. Hollywood probably has a lot of aspiration for him, and foresees even bigger, glitzier films. Whoever made this shows a lot of potential and you can just tell he wants to get at the meat of gritty reality. Unfortunately there is a lot of pomp and glam covering the entire picture that is, simply put, lame and often leads to inconsistent characters - case in point is Salma Hayek's.My suggestion to this Hollywood hotshot is spend about one year studying 'No Country For Old Men' - read the novel (as well as other Cormac McCarthy novels) and dig into the sophistication and gravity of the Coen's film version. 'No Country For Old Men' is a masterpiece in film and focus on that."
3,Savages,"I thought it would be better by what I had heard but, it's OK! Just a recycled Drug trafficing story!"
4,OK,It was OK; not great. The cinematography was very good and the music went well with the theme of the story.
2,Not very good,It was not what I expected. I though there would be more action. The acting was ok. I just didn't enjoy it.
2,Boring,"I was at least hoping for a mindless action movie, which the trailers showed me the possibility of, but this was not it. There was little action, and what's left was.. boring."
3,mehh,"I found it to be pretty unbelievable. Same old drug dealer / kingpin war over turf type story Except that they tried to turn pot into cocaine...it just didn't really gel very well and the female lead was somewhat pathetic...not likeable at all. It was just sort of uncomfortable to watch al the bad acting. Even Salma Hayak, who I like, did not really fit the role. I would wait until it comes out on streaming."
4,Solid movie,"This is a great movie from the great Oliver Stone. Anyone who enjoyed Blow or Alpha Dog, would definitely enjoy this movie."
3,3 star flick,"Movie was just ok. Selma Hayek looked fabulous and Benicio was his usual creepy character. It was a bit cheesy, but because of the plot... I am not surprised."
1,Wait...what?,"Frankly this movie was terrible. Echoing other reviews I agree that the acting was terrible, the plot was inherently unbelievable and the ending was an embarrassment to film. Blake Lively was especially bad and her character was so two dimensional I couldn't stop laughing at it. I haven't read the book so at first I thought Stone was trying to channel some tarantino and just failed miserably, but after reading other reviews it seems he just botched the translation from book to movie.Basically I just want to say DO NOT PAY FOR THIS SHIT."
2,Shooting Stars,This star filled movie failed to entertain. The basic idea of the story was poor so I should have guessed that no amount of star power could reverse the bad plot.
2,Ugh,"Looking at the cover and the quality of the actors, I thought this would be an awesome movie. Boy was I wrong. Slow in places.....just lame in the others. Do not waste your time or money on this one."
1,may be the worst movie I have ever seen,"Where to begin? The plot is terrible, the acting is uneven, and I do not understand what is likeable about any of the characters, nor what motivates them. The actor who plays Chon looks like he is on release from a soap opera contract and John Travolta just makes everyone feel uncomfortable. Blake Lively is so vacant that her doe eyed stares only carry her poor acting ability for the first five minutes of the film. This was a poor attempt at pulp fiction for the big screen and would have been in better hands with Quentin Tarantino than Oliver Stone given the campy subject matter.The book was better; any book is better."
1,"Awful, could have been better, and kind of racist","All the Mexicans really were portrayed as Savages, and the white people were the good guys. Ridiculous movie, they're all drug dealers. The entire movie was absolutely pretentious, with the ""brilliant"" pothead that went to Berkeley, gets an idea from his Marine buddy to get Afghan marijuana and grow and sell it in the US. Like no one else has ever thought of that before. LOL. Blake Lively proves that she has no business ever acting in Hollywood again, and her voiceovers are absolutely annoying. Really annoying. John Travolta is annoying. Benicio Del Toro was not convincing as a hitman, and neither was Salma Hayek as a drug lord. The whole movie was one big farce, laughable to the nines. I would seriously avoid this. Oliver Stone is a hack."
3,Boring,"Slow starting , wished John t was in the movie more, very confusingStory line was confusing to follow, I didn't finish the movie"
2,I wanted this to be better...,"The story was interesting, but fell apart with bad acting by Salma Hayek and a predictable (cop-out) ending. Taylor Kitsch was the best thing about this movie."
3,Predictable,"It's not horrible but not that great either. A little long for the storyline. There were a couple gruesome acts, but I've seen worse in horror flicks."
2,ok,cheesy acting weak writing the supporting cast was full a good actors but the no name main guys sucked bad
4,"Great Movie, but who wrote Amazon's plot synopsis??????","A very good and entertaining action movie, with a bit of a twist in that it is taken from a different point of view with German POWS in a British camp. Recommended.Who though wrote the synopsis for Amazon?? The camp is in Scotland, not ""Northern England"". Even southern Scotland is north of ""Northern England"". Also what is a ""U-Boat Commander Kreigsmarine Captain""? It's actually spelled Kriegsmarine and translates to ""Navy"" in English. So we have (with misspellings) a ""U-Boat Commander Navy Captain"". A bit redundant no?Recommendations: to those interested in a good rainy Saturday entertainment, buy this DVD; to the person who wrote this synopsis I suggest you buy a map of Britain and a German to English Dictionary."
1,German propaganda.,"There is no likeable character in this film.All of a sudden the German prisoners have a radio-transmitter / receiver, and have American uniforms.Unlikely and unbelievable.The 5-star reviews must be Germans, former SS, or shill-review- sellers. ""The Great Escape"" is a far better movie."
5,Wise!,"I stumbled across this gem in a bookstore. I love it. It's a nice spin on traditional self-help material, but more than that, the book is WISE. I'm impressed. Even though I've read and written a ton of stuff, this book stands out for its clairity and sheer joy. -- Joe Vitale www.MrFire.com"
2,Should please high schoolers.,"Anyone older than that will be put off by this simplistic bit of fluff. The author has pieced together quotes and statistics from other sources and throws them around liberally. It has the feel of a high school writing project. The advice she gives reads like something out of an article in ""Seventeen Magazine"". For example, here are some of her tips for cultivating friends, Italian style:1)Spend the time it takes to cultivate new friends.2)Go beyond the superficial to create intimacy.3)Practice giving and receiving affection.4)Be willing to listen.5)Show loyalty in your words and actions.I bet you never would have thought of those things on your own, right?Well, pay the $15.00 for this book and you can read 205 more pages full of equally valuable ""Italian"" advice.Buy it for a teen, or better yet, save your money."
4,NOT BAD AT ALL,"This CD is great, takes a while to like it. I used to think it was a crapy CD and now I listen to almost every song on the album. I also thought that I was going to like Speakerboxx better than The Love Below because I prefer rap and love the hit ""The Way You Move,"" but I ended liking The Love Below better, it has crazy lyrics which sounding ridicolous catch your attention some how. This CD has really good beats and lyrics as well, IT'S A MUST!"
3,""" Versatile ""","BETWEEN BOTH DISC OUTKAST PROVES TO BE ONE OF THE MOST VERSATILE GROUPS IN HIP HOP HISTORY... THE YEARS OF ROCKING THE MIC BETWEEN THE TWO HAVE DEFINATELY MADE THEM ICONS. OUTKAST EARNED THE RIGHT TO DO WHAT THEY WANNA DO, SAY WHAT THEY WANNA SAY AND BE HOW THEY WANNA BE. YOU JUST GOTTA LOVE THEM OR LEAVE THEM ALONE... MY FAVORITE ALBUM BY THE DUO IS STILL SOUTHERNPLAYALISTIC...... IT GETS 4.5 STARS."
1,"blah,blah blah","God? Love hater, Dracula's wedding,church, Ghetto. What a POOR choice. CLAY AIKEN IS ALOT BETTER!"
1,Overhype,"Okay overhype come get your overhype!The most uninspired lyrics in the world! There is no point in any songs they have released as singles! Hey Ya? Um is that about saying hi? How pointless.Love Below: That sucks! nothing nothing nothing... i want to pull my hair out.roses: okay the most uninspired song in history right beside timberlakes songs. ""i know you'd like to think that you don't stink...but roses really smell like poo poo poo?""Omg....I'm done.Want a real album...Check out any Michael JAckson album"
1,I wanted to be a fan...,"I borrowed this double disc CD set from a friend with the intention of burning it. After listening to them I thought it would be a waste of 2 CD's. It all just seems pointless to me. Some of it's catchy, but over all boring. And what's with this double disc bull? There isn't even enough good music to fill one disc. It's sad when you have 40-something tracks and only a handful of worthy material. Let's use Janet Jackson as an example here. Her single disc Rhythm Nation album spawned like 5 or 6 huge hits. Outkast on the other hand won't do that with a double disc album. There is something wrong with that. I'm not saying that these artist are in any way simular. I'm just comparing hits on a single disc album vs. a double disc one. Truthfully I really wanted to be a fan, but it's going to take more than some HEY YA! to do that."
3,Lyrics To Roses,"I found a website containing the lyrics to Roses and I found out they are saying, ""See that roses really smell like poo-ooo-ooo""""Yeah, roses really smell like poo-ooo-ooo."" I just thought for those who were wondering what he was saying was really true. To think I was thinking he was saying ohhh, ohhh!!"
2,Mediocre,"I thought this album would be good, considering the fact that everyone said it was great. I on the other hand hate it. There are like a couple good songs but thats it. This album really didnt deserve any Grammys at all. I really like Outkast, but this album is really not worth mine or your money."
5,"to the haters, once again....","go buy some ca$h money or ruff ryders or no limit if you're looking for the same old 98 bpm male posturing that all hip-hop, short of the dungeon family and all their proteges, has become... if you hate this album, it's because you don't understand it and you fear anything different or visionary! had you been around in the 1400's y'all probably would have insisted the world is flat......."
5,classic,"this album is a masterpeice. big boi's side is great,but andre's side is perhaps the best album of theyear. buy this as soon as you can."
4,impressed,"What happens when you cross the musical styles of Prince, Cameo, and southern jazz musicians? The answer of course is Andre 3000. 'The Love Below' is a breath of fresh air in today's stale musical enviroment. At times the lyrics are simple (maybe even stupid), but just the fact that Dre is trying something new for all of us, we will give his lyrics a break. Big Boi's side of the album is not that impressive. Same ol' southern flow, there are a couple of good tracks here and there. Will this album break them up and send them in different directions ... we will see."
5,2 of the greatest,"Original, creative, amazing. 2 of the best albums of all time in one case. I listened to big boi's disc first. dispite featuring tired rapers - jay-z, lil' jon, east side boyz and ludacris the disk is nice. I thought dre's contribution would be a disapointment. i was so wrong. even better than the first. words can't do it justice. just listen. This is what hip hop should be."
4,Innovative?,"To be honest, I haven't heard this music more than a few times, so I'm not going to review it, but I quite enjoyed it actually. Clearly, it's a very creative mix of a wide variety of musical influences, especially on Andre's LOVE BELOW. I just want to say ""Hey Ya!"" isn't the revelatory genius morphing of hip-hop people make it out to be. It just sounds like old New Wave. Fun and poppy. If you like this, you should go check out some old XTC records. Peace!"
3,Interesting,"Ok Lets get one thing straight. No Outkast song can measure to ""Mrs.Jackson"" I Dont care about ""Players Ball"" or ""B.O.B."" or ""Rosa Parks"" or even ""Hey Ya"" These cd's are pretty cool. Andre's Cd most people dont like because outkast is a hip hop group(one of the best ever..Big up to public enemy and Run D.M.C.)People wanna hear hip hop.Well I happen to like andre's better beacuse its more of a soul albumn.Theres no way that you will love both of these Cd.s ""Hey Ya"" And ""Dracula's Wedding"" are good song for andre but ""Roses"" is the best. For Big BOi its ""The Way You Move"" and ""Unhappy"" Despite what they say ""Getto Musik"" Isnt that good.The Bottom line:Outkast is changeing althugh i will miss the old ""Mrs.Jackson"" Tunes i look forward to see what they have in store."
2,Disappointing.. at least to me,"I was very excited to get this cd and thought that 2 for 20 bucks was a great deal. Especially since it was outkast. Well, from now on i will be cautious of getting another outkast cd. The first album is just about complete crap and has just about no actual rap on it. The 2nd cd is a little bit better with actual rap but still is very disappointing. Like some of the other people who have reviewed this album have said... if you're getting this cd because youve heard songs like Hey Ya, The Way You Move, Church, or Roses, then you might want to hear some of the other songs first. I dont like how Andre has changed his style here and I really expected more from this cd. I know that they are trying to be different and everything, but if you're gonna do that at least have the same or better level of quality."
1,puzzy ass sellouts,"if zero stars was an option this cd would get it...this is horrible, for one dre isnt even a rapper hes a f---ing singer...THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A F---ING RAP CD, and beside that all the beats are whack, so if ur a fan of music and not a fan of grown men with perms dressing like leprachauns and indians than look somewhere else"
1,Disgusting Music.,"I borrowed Speakerboxxx from a friend after hearing they won grammy's and all that MTV hype. After around half hour of listening this, I reflected upon the sad state of the music industry. If albums that are this bad are winning grammy's, there is no hope for hip hop or rap. Severely over hyped and talentless. Limp Bizkit is great rap. Not this crap."
1,ANNOYING!,Outkast is the most annoying rappers I have ever heard besides eminem. Their songs don't even make sense. I hope they never make an other cd as long as they live.
1,A Double NO!!,"Double you pain, double your boredom. That seems to have been the M.O. when Andre ""Ice Cold"" 3000 and Big Boi decided to record solo albums and release it as a double CD. These 28 year old ""youngster"" (yeah, right!) are among the most overrated in all of pop music, and tied for the single most overrated in hip-hop. Run-DMC this is not, heck it isn't even Wu-Tang to be honest. Yes, as a middle-aged (there, I said it) woman, I am not part of the targeted demographic. But I do babysit my friend's teenage daughters on the a regular basis (the stork has not made a deliver to me yet, but I've put in a prayer to God). They keep these discs ""bumpin"" in my car all the time and I've had enough!"
1,Spearboxx is way below expectations,When you think of outcast this music they are making seems foreign what the hell were they thinking man this music is terrible I wouldnt listen to the cd if it was given to me let alone buy it. After this cd outcast is definitly going to be forced into early retirement
5,Jay-Z not welcome,"I just got this cd like 2 days ago but have been waiting for it for over a year. So far it's pretty sweet, I like the Andre disc for the refreshing flava it brings to hip hop, I like the Big Boi disc for it's dirty production (sweet 808 sounds) and his rhyming is still great. I take offense at CDNOW listing similar artists as being 50 cent, Jay-Z and all these other fake as* sellout crappers. Outkast are among the greats in hip-hop and shouldn't be compared to anyone, if you're going to put them along side other acts to check out it should be like Blackalicious, Del and the roots because of the progressive experimental sound they all try. I hate Jay-Z and can only imagine how much production work had to be done on place to be to get his ""rhyming"" up to speed."
5,Amazing from Andre 3000,"I enjoyed this album. Big Boi delivered the rap side of the group, with conscious/philosophical songs like: ""Church"" and ""War"" along with others. Yet to me it was blown away when I first hit play one Andre 3000 ""The Love Below."" He opens the LP with a beautiful upbeat jazz song. The rest of it goes together something close to Marvin Gaye's ""What's Going On?"" album, where you can play it all the way through and not enjoy each song. My favorite tunes from ""The Love Below"": She Lives in My Lap, Take Off Your cool, A Day in the Life of Andre Benjamin."
5,Another Outkast Classic,"What Outkast did with this album was break down their last two albums and showed you where the diverse part comes from and the basic hip hop is from. This album is another Hip Hop Classic from one of the Best not only Hip Hop groups of all time but Music Groups of all time. This is an all time Classic for more than one reason. The more you listen to it the more you like it, which says a lot for the future.Andre 3000 Disc is one of the most creative Hip Hop albums ever created. The fact that he spends majority of the time singing does not take anything away from him still being one of the most prolific M.C's in the game. This is evident from the closing song on his disc.Big Boi's Disc is hands down the best Southern Area Hip Hop album of the year. he shows you how to have skills, fun and originality with the same ol' girls and crunk formula.Together they cannot be stopped as Hip Hop's Best Duo."
3,THE WAY YOU MOVE,I wish that the record industry would start making rap and hip hop artists give credit to the original artists when they remake a song. I have been racking my brain trying to figure out where Outkast took the hook for THE WAY YOU MOVE from. If anybody knows could you please e-mail me.Thank YOUqueen_19_39@yahoo.com
5,OutKast album is the bomb!,"Man you gotta give it to OutKast, I followed them from when I was just a teenager and every album was a smash and a pleasure for the ears. never afraid to experiment. Speakerboxx has outstanding tracks- I have been playin continuosly for days:Best cuts: Unhappy - nice slow beat, way you move- infectious, Rooster,Toom, Knowing and War.Now Love Below- when I listened first, man I said Andre must be slippin but upon second and third listen, I am playing this more than SpeakerBoxx. Once you get past the fact that he's not rapping and open up your mind, this is tight stuff-Best Cuts- happy V-Day, Spread, Prototype, Behold, dracula, Hey Ya - he should get 'Video of The Year' for that. Look here, the guys are getting older and we have all seen Nas age 30 and Eminem age 30 change up a bit , this stuff is refreshing and beats that gun in your face + he is lifting up his women instead of all this other rap out there. Buy This!"
1,Im sorry I had to do this.,"Someone please tell me why people think this album is so great.I fail to see it.Here we have 2 guys who have alot of talent.But yet somehow they achieved to put out the worst album Ive ever heard.There isnt 1 song on Andre's CD that I liked and I think there were 3 songs on Big Boi's cd that I thought were worth listening to.And to think this album actually won a Grammy.....Where Is Music Going To Theses Days?That Im Not Sure,But I Dont Think I Want To Stick Around Much Longer To Find Out."
2,Throw it OUTKAST,"I've listened to this dual CD set several times, and I'm disappointed with this latest Outkast production. I've been listening to this duo since they first came out, and I feel that Big Boi and Andre 3000 are better served (just like the fans) when they combine their strengths into one CD instead of going solo on each one. There are a couple tracks that I like from each one, namely Big Boi's ""Tomb of the Boom"" and Andre's ""Happy Valentine's Day"", and I also like the change of pace from their usual foray, but it doesn't work. Instead of getting Big Boi's gangsta apporach and Andre's snappy funk combined into each track, we get each artist's specialties seperately, and like the duality of man, one doesn't work without the other."
4,There's Something Wrong?,"*scratches head* Now I am OBVIOUSLY not a rap fan, as my likes tend to run toward Enya and Dido. HOWEVER, after immensely enjoying ""Hey Ya"" and ""The Way You Move"" (and finding out I needed it for school), I picked this up. Kick me if you want, but I found The Love Below to be a horrible CD (and I'm a girl, too!). The only good thing it's got going for itself is ""Hey Ya!"". Honestly, I licked up Speakerboxxx like a cat drinks milk. ""Bowtie"" is my favorite (I have even danced to it for a presentation, and the crowd loved it), followed by a tie (""Ghetto Music"" and ""The Way You Move"" and another tie for third (""Rooster"" and ""Tomb of the Boom""). If I could give this three and half stars, I would. One lopped off for the stinky inclusion of The Love Below, and another half for all the times I've heard ""Roses"" on the radio. IN SHORT: Totally worth my money!"
2,"Good Title, Bad Movie","After seeing the Omega Code I wonder what all the hype was about. It was an in your face Christian movie that was just plain bad. The only redeming quality was Michael York as EU Chairman Stone Alexander. Casper Van Dien and Catherine Oxenburg were horrible and Michael Ironside was ok. The movie started off slow and really didn't pick up. It seemed as if Stone Alexander was so dependant on the codes he wouldn't make a move with out them. The movie never really got going and the plot was terrible. It was a typical ""soul saving"" Chritian movie that I could have done without."
1,you can't give 0stars?,Me and a friend went to see this and when it was over he said he should beat me up(edited for content) for wasting 2 hours of his life he could never get back on the worst movie ever made . . . and I agree he should have . . . Please don't waste your money on this
3,Would have been better if...,"...the Rapture of the Church had occurred in the film. This film, while pretty accurate in some areas, is in fact pretty silly. It might have made more money than any other Christian film, but it isn't as good as others. The characters are good, but I just had a problem with Michael York as the antichrist (Nick Mancuso was more convincing in ""Revelation"" and ""Tribulation""). It is a pretty decent film, but after seeing the ""Apocalypse"" trilogy, this film is quite funny."
2,REVELATION PLUS BIBLE CODE,"The movie is a common evangelical conception of what the book of Revelation means. The movie forgets some of the important aspects of the prophecy such as Wormwood poisoning 1/3 the waters and jumps right to the beast stuff. It uses a series of fake Bible Codes in order to make the prophecy of Revelation more convincing. The characters are hokey. People are either all good or all bad. The acting is soap-opera style of exaggeration to the point of being cartoonish. The whole idea that whoever controls Jerusalem controls the world is inane, even in the game of Risk."
3,It was ok,"It was watchable but not inspiring. The actors seemed good, however I think that it lacked depth. The plot was based on bible codes, which might have had more meaning if I believed in them. Also it was missing a lot of other things that would have made it a good movie-such as a strong enough good guy (to counteract all of the bad guys that they had), better settings in some of the shots and much more Christianity."
1,Worst than the Antichrist!!!!!!,"This movie is worst than the Antichrist!Because TBN is a better lier than ""he""!I'll never watch a TBN film ""ever"" again,this garbage is not even wortha rental.How could a ""Christian"" Orgscrew and twist the book of Revto such a degree and pretend thatit's a fine ""great!!"" movie?I would expect ""Christians"" of TBNto do an exact story of the Bible..or one that is very close.What a joke! Don't spend your money or time!"
1,Bad acting,"I had heard from some friends that this movie was great but the acting and screen play was so poor we had to turn it off. It was boring, laughable and hokey. I am a Christian and active in drama in the church. It is extremely disappointing to me that I haven't seen any quality Christian movies. I am hoping the new Left Behind movie will be good."
1,0 Stars would be much better,"Well, a buddy bought this and I sat through it again, all the while wondering if it would have gotten any better in the translation from the big screen.... No, it didn't but at least I didn't pay to see it this time...I still can't figure out the opening, where the bad guy shoots the guy decoding the secret code. He shoot shim, sneaks out, is suddenly confronted at all turns by shadowy people who seem to have the power to do something to this guy.. since he seems to want to avoid any confrontation.. THEN he gets cornered by two of them and grabs a child holding her hostage.. now we think he will get his, but they just TALK! Then he walks away with not a care in the world. And there must be millions of cameras spread all over the city since the evil mastermind is supposedly watching through one that happens to be right there... hmmmmm and this was just the OPENING of the movie... sad sad sad..."
3,"Well planned, but not well thought out.","The Omega Code was reccomended to me by my brother, who had gone to see it while it was in the theaters. Making a mistake I've made a few other times when it came to movies, I trusted my brother's judgement. So, I went and rented a copy. While thoroughly entertaining, it was also thoroughly disappointing. It becomes apparent that it ""focuses"" on the Tribulation that the Bible speaks of . . . yet it doens't seem to exactly follow from what I've read and studied about the Tribulation. Not to mention the whole timing thing seemed rather screwed. Yes, it did have the two prophets, yes, it did have the antichrist, but *hms* what DIDN'T it have is the question . . . while it did have more Biblical reference than I thought it would (I'd never even seen reviews of it aside from what my brother said) they really shouldn't have gone part way."
1,Ambrose Bierce said it best:,"""FAITH: Belief without evidence in what is told by one who speaks without knowledge, of things without parallel."""
1,WHAT A RIP,"The the exagerated promotional hype was typical of the mega ""D"" rated production this was. The plot, that an omnipotent God's power could be deminished by some secret numerical code out of the ""Bible"" a book that ""God"" is supposed to have created, is as mindless as anybody that wuold buy into it. Acting was extreeemly poor paralleled with equally poor directioin. As for writing, well, ""The Revelation of Garfield"" would have set the seen with as much scriptural reverence. I can't remember a bigger disapointment in a movie."
2,Less than I had hoped for,"I liked the concept behind this book: looking at family history and the way that individuals develop according to life experiences. However, the essays inside the book were, on the whole, underwhelming. They were written by students, and I found the quality of the work to be much lower than what I would have expected. The interviews were not very deep and they were not, in my opinion, very eloquently represented. I felt like I was reading the work of junior-high school students, not any sort of sociological examination"
2,The Monarchy,"This is a well done piece however very dated by at least a decade. Rather disappointing. A lot has happened with the Royal Family (the divorce of the Prince and Princess of Wales, the death of Princess Diana, the Queen Mother, Princess Margaret, etc.) It should be pointed out to your customers just how old this is. I bought a second copy along with my own to give as a Christmas gift and was very upset to learn just how dated this is."
4,old,"Good for it's time, but very dated now. Much of the footage is from the late 80s or early 90s. An excellent documentary, but not current."
2,Thought It Would Be Better,The reviews online were so-so on this product. I think the story line and art are average compared to other romance mangas I have read.
1,what happened!!!,mature=boring.if you are a replacements fan or solo westerberg fan rum as fast as you can away from this tragedy.easily the worst work hes EVER produced.a straight a student brings home an f!(if i could have given this 0 stars i would have!)
5,Lo-Fi for those who still feel,"Simply the fact that the most stirring songs on this album are minimally produced further backs testament that Paul Westerberg is one of the greatest ""bare-bones"" songwriters to ever grace the popular music scene. ""Best Thing That Never Happened"" sounds like it was recorded from a car in the parking lot outside of the studio with a dictation cassette recorder, which only adds to it's impact. It's refreshing to be reminded that as long as songs are truly written with skill and heart, they don't need whistles and bells to move a listener. This is not the type of album one wants to just plop in the player and listen to passively while cleaning their apartment or driving their car. This is the kind of album that invites you to simply sit in a chair and LISTEN to it. I furthermore can't conceive of anyone listening to ""Born For Me"" without thinking of someone. This album in my opinion is a healthy dose of the real deal."
3,Ideas & Opinions,"Since Einstein was supposed to be the smartest man of the 19th and 20th centuries, I thought I could get some insight into questions that had puzzled man since the beginning. The meaning of life. What am I doing here? That kind of stuff. Well, let me tell you I spent all my time looking up words on my Franklin. That's the problem with smart people. They try to prove how smart they are by using words that nobody else understands. In my case, Einstein succeeded. I think he's real smart but I still don't know what I'm doing here."
4,The Man Behind the Mind,"This book was easy to read, but hard to follow. In effect it was a way to see how such a genius formed his thoughts. Many other great minds have autobiographies, but rarely do you see a chance to see how such great thoughts are formed."
3,"Magnifying glass, please!","I like the book, but didn't realize the print would be so small! I can hardly read it."
1,Do not recommend.,"I was very disappointed from constantly frizzy hair results. I have used this product several time with different stuff added to my hair to increase chance of firm curls, but no luck. The worst was when I wanted to use it once again after 2 weeks and the steaming jar didnt work properly. Almost not at all. I do not recommend this product."
2,Not Worth The Money,"When I received this product, the rollers (that were in several different baggies) all had a moldy musty smell to them. So far, soaking them in several soapy solutions hasn't helped. They work, but I would suggest that they be used for young girls (tweens/teens) as they don't keep a lasting curl. My thick hair would not hold the curl they produced. Even on my granddaughter's fine, long hair, the curl tends to brush out easily."
3,DANCE HALL,"I really enjoyed the character of Joe Leaphorn. He seemed very capable of carrying out his job, and you really felt the inner struggles he went through. However, I felt very bogged down by the cultural info (I didn't understand it), and almost felt cheated when I discovered what happened to the young man Leaphorn was searching for throughout the novel."
2,History Book?,"I must say that Dance Hall of the Dead was not what i expected it to be. Instead i thought that i was reading a history book about the navahos and zuni's, the the whole mystery element was gone. I cant say that I enjoyed this book."
4,Great mystery,"As far as mystery writers go, Tony Hillerman is one of the best I have read. Not only is the plot very interesting, but the information on the Indian culture and traditions makes this book more enticing."
5,An Old Favorite Found Once More,"I used to wear Byzance a lot and couldn't locate it in stores until I discovered it on Amazon. In fact, there are other old faves I'd like to try, too..plus some new scents. Can my nose handle the variety? It remains to be..smelled."
3,Cesar Fan,"I am a true Cesar Millan fan, but this video is simply a few episodes taken from his series. The title lead me to believe that the ""stories of hope and inspiration"" would be stories not included in the television series, something extra. I felt as though I was tricked."
5,Dog whisperer,"I love The Dog Whisperer, h has great videos. I bought several for a friend to help her with her dog. I love how Ceasar controls ant dog in just seconds. If you have never watched him on National Geographic you need to get one of his videos."
1,Calcium,"I thought this product was calcium citrate, but it turns out it is carbonate which is not the recommended product by nutritionist I have talked with."
2,Just not very durable,"We loved the way it looks but unfortunately the construction is lacking. First the top step cracked at the hinge, then bottom step broke when an adult stepped on it. It's not wood. It wouldn't be hard to make a step handle a hundred pounds but this one won't and doesn't."
5,Great investment!,I love this automatic water fountain. It is so easy for the dogs to use and they always have cold water. With the heat of the summer in full swing this has been a lifesaver! I would recommend this product to anyone who has to keep their dogs outside for any length of time.
2,Go with Shonen Knife or The 5.6.7.8's instead,"Puffy is typical J-Pop; typically safe, typically over-produced, typically boring. After reading all of the glowing reviews of this group and myself being a ferocious Shonen Knife and 5.6.7.8's fan, I decided to try Puffy. To begin with I am baffled that anyone who likes the two aforementioned bands would have even a passing interest in Puffy's cookie cutter, trite, empty pop. Admittedly the Teen Titans theme on 59 rocks, but everything else from this ""band"" is the exact same as all other J-Pop drivel. Do yourself a favor and listen to some honest, homegrown Osaka rock before you waste your time with this stuff."
3,Old Version,"I really like this book. I part of a newer edition before buying the original. I definitely like the newer version better because the reference verses a in a newer translation, but the rest is the same and still awesome. Still working through this book, but so far it has been a great resource for getting to know who God is better!"
4,Not the same,"My daughter (now 4) grew up with the Australia version of the Hi-5 band. However, when looking back now, they prefer the US version more. Still entertaining, they just don't know the songs as well as the US ones. My son (2 1/2) doesn't care, he will jump and dance to anything!"
5,A very clear account,"I have read this book and found it to be very comprehensive in it's layout and content. The 27 ""Medals of Honor"" that were earned during the battle of Iwo Jima are very well accounted for in this book. I found myself having to put the book down just to digest some of the chapters before reading more. The 8,621 American and over 21,000 Japanese soldiers losses during the 36 day battle for Iwo Jima's 8-1/2 square miles clearly justifies the very unfortunate need to use the atomic bombs on the Japanese Homeland to end the war. This book really lets the reader know what cost would have been and what would have happened if America tried to invade the Japanese Homeland."
4,Interesting!,wow! There's alot of information contained in each page. And it's interactive with moveable flaps to show more fun facts :) Great for kids who can read.
4,amazing.,"this is fredrik thordendals solo album (lead guitarist of meshuggah) with a stunning display of musical tallent which is composed as 1 whole big song cut into parts with subtitles the overall feel and sound of this album is very alien, and dark, like as if you where droped onto some planet in another gaxlay and everything foregin to you. or you where ubducted by aliens and they where inside your mind, the degree of musical marksmanship is very high on this album, and is and allways will be a favorite album out of my high standards. this album is very orginal and is a must have for meshuggah freaks, but yes, theres quite a low quantity avalble. absolutely amazing display of guitar solos, it wont disapoint i asure you."
4,grinder,This grinder is almost exactly like the one we purchased 30 years ago. In fact the only difference is the color of the clear plactic. It does an ok job but nothing great. There is only minimul difference between the fine and coarse. I quess its ok but there was nothing alse out there for the price.
4,Progressive Nut Chopper,"Really like this nut chopper, it has 2 great features.Measurements on the jar, so you can tell when you have enough nuts chopped.Secondly I love the feature that alloows you 2 different grinds! medium and tiny.I bought 2 one to keep and one to give to a friend!"
2,Nut grinder,"Don't bother with this one unless you only have occasional need with soft nuts. Works poorly on almonds; especially when frozen - tines even broke off. Only one thread holds cap and base, ended up with a cable clamp around it to hold secure."
2,OK product,I found that the chopper made the nut to small/fine for my taste. Found it better when I chopped them myself with a knife.
3,It's OK,It works allright but is a little difficult on some of the harder tree nuts like hazelnuts and macadamia nuts. It did seem to work better with walnuts. also my hand got tired.
2,disappointed in product,"The top section of this product screws onto the bottom section. However, the threads are not long enough to adequately engage the two sections. As a result, when grinding, the two sections come apart because the threads are insufficient. Very disappointing."
4,Good chopper but top comes loose as I crank.,"Chops nuts beautifully and I like having the choice of fine or coarse chop. Maybe because I'm left-handed, but the top half (nut hopper?) tends to come loose as I turn the handle. Otherwise a great chopper."
1,Poor quality,"I had the same problem as several others. The first part that broke was a small plastic piece holding the handle in place. Then two of the metal blades came off. In both instances I found the missing parts in my food. It is a really great design, and when it worked it worked well, I just can't recommend a product that has broken off after regular use in just a few months."
1,"Sucks, the upper half opens as you twist handle..","Sucks, the upper half opens as you twist handle..The plastic upper 1/2 thread is not deep enough and it will keep opening while I turn the handle.The crasher works well, but it's annoying since upper 1/2 comes apart all the time. They needed to make it more secure. bad design.Sean."
3,Almost there,"I bought this chopper a couple years ago and so far have not had any trouble with the teeth bending or breaking off, even when using frozen nuts. From the photo provided here on Amazon, it looks as if they've changed the design of the lid. I hope that is so, because the two lids I have (one for each side) are incredibly cheap plastic. A really bad fid onto the unit and one lid completely tore so it couldn't be used anymore. the other side is nearly as bad. It's only kept in place to keep the nuts from falling through the bottom. With a better lid, I would rate this 4 or 5 stars."
1,DANGEROUS!!!,"Do not buy this product. I had the same experience with the other reviewers. A metal ""teeth"" which is the grinding portion was in between the nuts and of course it went into my cake batter. A guest bite into it. It was 1.5cm big!!! Thank goodness it wasn't a child who ate it!"
3,Regular!,Progressive International Heavy Duty Nut Chopper . Muele demasiado grueso y no se puede regular para cuando uno necesita picado mas fino.
2,Don't Expect Much Except a Journey to the Past,"A charming book that has a few basic experiments, but nothing that would hold the interest for a young reader because so much of the information is outdated. It is a good book for the bibliophile who wants to go down memory lane. It might also be a good book to show your grandchild and explain ""how things were when you were young."" Feminists beware! Some contents may be offensive (not to say the cover)."
4,French Blood,"Sara finds a note on the windowsill addressed to Tamara, and this note draws her into the past, through 1672 and, in particular, to her past love, one that could continue!Through Antonio's secret and the journal of Angelina Blanc, French Blood reveals an extraordinary love story, a tale of stolen love, lost memories, and disguised Vampires trying to make contact with the present.`French Blood is a riveting tale, a good read.'"
5,Great classic film.,"I am a huge fan of Kenneth Roberts's novels and have watched this film many times over the years. Although not as sweeping in scope as the novel itself, this film is a solid adaptation. Hollywood just doesn't do large-scale historical epics like this anymore, which is unfortunate. When I was a boy, these types of films helped a history-lover like me to dream of bygone eras. I very much regret their passing."
5,Great movie,"I ordered this movie because I remember seeing it many years ago and loving it. I had to wait a long time before it fianlly came out as a DVD, but it was worth the wait. There was a lot of it I had forgotten. Thank you so much."
3,A wide overview,"... although perhaps a bit outdated. Covers most topics included in a first course in plasma phisics, with a bias towards particle description (as opposed to continuum, MHD approach). If you're looking for your first book about plasmas and charged particles, this is not what you're looking for. However, if you're well into the field then this may be a useful addition to your collection."
2,What a disappointment!,"What a disappointment! This could have been an interesting story. In the end we learn very little about cartography or even the events this book purports tot tell. One lengthy pointless detour after another that go no where. Where was the editor? The author's shallow attempt to relate the plot to his own ""journey"" is particularly stupid. Skip this one."
1,A marketing triumph,"It is a shame that this book got so much attention when there are so many other books of this genre--creative nonfiction--that are better researched, better written, and contain more interesting observations and insights. Harvey has not figured out how to use the personal voice in writing. He does it awkwardly and for all the wrong reasons. This book must have been supported by a heavy marketing campaign--it could not have attracted this much attention on its own. It's regrettable because the subject was interesting and deserved a better writer, one who could have seen where the story was and gone there, rather than doggedly slogging through the story he set out to write, flinging cliches and sophomoric self-awareness left and right. A sad comment on contemporary publishing that this book was marketed heavily while so many truly wonderful books are published but not a cent is spent to ensure they reach the reading public they deserve."
2,Glad I bought it overstock,"Aside from the poor writing style, this book is effectively about nothing yet Harvey tries to write about everything. The book never comes to a focus, but instead dances around many many topics related and unrelated to cartography. The interesting thing is that the author poised himself as a researcher, yet this book couldn't feel less thought out. Thank goodness for the overstock section at my local bookstore."
2,The Island of loong story that you plough through,"Twas such a good concept BUT....the tale is too long.the meanderings are not that interesting.He tries too hard to find something to say about Bland when in fact maybe there is not that much to say.He tries to put everythign he ever learnt into the book - bad editing.NO real flair for writing.Lots of references, lots of names but SO WHAT?!What did I get from this book?ummm. i got a few titles of OTHER books that may be of more interest to me.Sad but true.Such potential BUT....!"
4,She's Back!!,"I have not heard from Robin Lane since the Chartbuster's second album in 1982. This album does not disappoint though,-she remains the queen of jangly folk-rock. Excellent work, Robin!!"
3,i cant understan....,"how can a movie have three bad effects, and the movie within bein just good... you all kow what im talking about right??"
3,TIME TO GET EVEN,"If you're fascinated with revenge flicks like CARRIE or WILLARD, then TAMARA is an okay entry in this genre. Jenna Dewan plays both the mousy outcast and the suddenly sexy siren who wreaks revenge on the group that humiliated and eventually killed her. Dewan has a nice foxy demeanor and she uses it well, and the rest of the twenty somethings who play teenagers also fit the bill. Matthew Marsden adds some nice maturity as the English teacher who is the desire of the lonely Tamara. It's all a little gory and preposterous, but it has style and it's entertaining, and with the recent horde of horrible horror movies, it's a good break!"
1,Oh NO!!,"It starts out interesting ,but when it's supposed to be scary it's not,I got it because it says the makers of Final Destination,BUT the knock off scenes where cheap and got UNINTERESTING QUICK,not worth the watch."
5,"Lyrics that strike home, in a southern country rock rythm","This is country music, but I hate country and I love this CD. The lyrics really hit home for generation X'ers that are tired of looking for love. These guys can play fast or slow and I promise you'll be singing all the songs word for word in your first week with this CD."
2,"5 Stars Huh? Profanity ""F"" Word in Every Sentence, Poor Writing HELL ON WHEELS much better, sorry.","Felt compelled to write after seeing 5 star review on this show. I am a history junkie buff 100%. Love Westerns, Civil War themes, war themes, etc. I gave this horrible series Deadwood 3 episodes when it made it's debut years back. Horrible! Make no mistake, profanity laced language, ""The F-word"" ""the C-sucker word"" do not offend me. But what does offend me poor writing and writers who put the f-word and c-sucker in every freaking god-dang sentence. This show sucked. Reject, sorry. Watch Hell on Wheels now with (2) two fantastic seasons completed. Hell on Wheels is 5 stars, Deadwood is 2 stars if that. I'm thinking youngsters who have been brainwashed with modern poor writing, profanity laced movies like this Deadwood crap?"
5,Another Great Success by Dave Hall,"After buying Dave Hall's first CD, ""Playin' the Man,"" and immediately loving it so much that I bought copies to send to two friends, I was wondering if he could come out with another one equally as good, without merely repeating a formula he had come up with. He indeed answered my question when I bought ""Places."" It's delightfully different than ""Playin' the Man"" but maintains the same rich quality of lyric, music, and voice. Dave Hall is a poet as well as a composer of music. While not obscure, his lyrics require close listening in order to appreciate the carefully chosen words. The melodies and the harmonies create an aural texture of color and light which match his lyric poetry. Beautiful, unique, and original. And Dave Hall's lovely voice makes it all come alive."
5,DA SOUTH STILL HOLDING THE TITLE!!!,"I saw some other reviews but, I'm here to set the record straight. These boys are lyrically gifted. I was hooked on YoungBloodz from their first album, ""Against Da Grain."" And ""Drankin Patnaz"" speaks for itself. When you here ""Damn"" in the club you can't help but to throw bows and ""ATL Stomp.""Nobody could not like this album, it gets heavy rotation in my car and house. YEEEAAAHHH!!!!"
4,Great Southern Crunk,"Ultra sweet album from my fellow ATLiens. ""Damn"" is a great song, ""Lean Low"", ""Cadillac Pimpin"" and ""Hustle"" all stick out as other great songs. But by far my favorite song on the album is ""My Automobile."" I highly recommend this cd to any southern crunk fans, any fans of lil' jon or the ying yang twins will love this album."
4,WATCHOUT THEIR DRIVIN!!!,lane to lane is a great song and its sumptin ya can bump in yo ride! the rest of the album is pretty good but some of tha tracks i juz cant git into sry but its a pretty good cd overall
4,"A life boat in the deepest, darkest sea","Being an intelligent woman of the nineties, when I lost my son in a terrible accident I looked for an intellectual way to survive. This book helped me discover that I wasn't going to survive, but adapt. That adapting my new life without my child was not going to require intellect but basic instinct. The same instinct that made me a mother, is going to see me through the rest of my life without my child. They should give this book out as part of grief therapy. It should be required reading for any professional that works with parents that have survived their children."
3,"Overwhelming, poor instructions, lots of fun stuff","I expected a complete kit with detailed and well-written instructions to get me going as a beginner in model railroading. Plan on spending a bunch more on glue, paint, possibly airbrush kits, how-to guides, and other details like the little figures, vehicles, and lighting. Also, for a complete town, there seem to be some obvious things missing, like a gas station and people's homes. I would definitely have been more confident in building my first structures if the instructions were more substantial than ""look at the picture."" The quality of the product rates among the best, but this is a kit for those with previous railroad layout modeling experience and a ton of acrylic paint. It's a pity, because, with the proper documentation, this kit could help to hook Woodland Scenics customers for life."
2,Far from favorite,"I bought 2 of these due to the reviews, wear a 38 J cup. IT is too big, and there is a TON of material. I HATE underwires. Under the arm pits is dreadful, it makes me sweat like a pig and I dislike the feel of the whole thing. It runs way big and does not offer much in the way of support. Not comfortable and the straps are not very comfy either.I must echo all other large breasted womens comments. What is wrong with bra makers? I tried making my own bra in desperation, that was a bust. Apparently unless you wear a 34 b or c cup we are doomed to crummy over priced, ugly colors and ugly pieces of junk. If I were not so large breasted I would just give up.I just wear my old glamorise that have muffin tops because they do not go over an I cup."
2,not a great fit,"I bought this hoping it would fit (impossible to find my size and suitable style) and be an easy wear. The straps do not shorten enough for any support at all. The band material is not soft enough to prevent chafing (a problem for me with very thin skin) - so I would not get another, and have it to wear on occasion, but fit for support and comfort are not suitable for me situation. I have no complaint about the quality and such for others, but straps that won't shorten more is a big drawback for me."
1,Disappointing,"I was lured by the story's intriguing premise of three ""spinsters"" defying convention in 1830s China. Unfortunately, the book is written so badly that the premise never develops to its potential. The characters are poorly developed, as is the plot. It reads like a bad folk tale. Too bad - in the hands of a better author this could have been a great story."
5,REAL F- - -ING GOREGRIND,"This is nothing short of a classic. This is up in the ranks of Carcass and Repulsion in my book. The only complaint that I have is that it should be longer. But with 63 or whatever tracks, it works none the less. If you like any kind of grind BUY IT."
1,Not worth it,"I bought this one because I was planning a trip to New Guinea and wanted to read up on it a bit. Big waste of 15 bucks -- I have to concur with the other reviewers. This is perhaps the only book I've ever read where I found myself taking an active dislike to the author.A better book about New Guinea (minus the faux-zen ramblings, but with discussions of marsupials) is Throwim Way Leg."
1,What a piece of junk!,"This CD is a huge piece of crap. The ""kidz"" singing the songs totally ruin them! ""Bring Me To Life"" sounds terrible when those kids sing it. I'd have to say Evanescence sings it better. I encourage you NOT to buy this CD!"
1,WHY WHY WHY!!!!!!!,"If any parents haven't noticed, these songs WERE NOT MEANT FOR CHILDREN!!!! Most of these were written for adults/teens. The lyrics have more depth than these realize. Do not buy this for your kid. Whoever's idea it was to start this in the first place should be shot. It's horrible!!!"
1,They DON'T sound the same.,"I just now listened to this here sample of ""bring me to life"" and I started cracking up. The woman who is singing the verse sounds like a duck that's choking on a meatball, and the guy singing the echoes in the chorus sounds like some random wrestler/drunk dude they just pulled off the street. And then there are the kids. Oh my God, what can I say about the kids? They sound like overweight chipmunks.I've read a few reviews here that says that Kidz Bop's Bring Me to Life and Evanescence's Bring Me to Life sound the same. That's impossible. Even if you take out the kids, Kidz Bop's version is nothing like the original. Just listen to each sample to get an idea. In the first verse of the original, Amy Lee's voice vibrates when she sings the word ""home"". On the Kidz Bop version, the word ""home"" sounds really nasaly. And that's just one word out of the whole song. Listen to both samples and you'll probably find even more differences."
5,"Great, Inspiring, and Accurate",This is the most definitive book I have read on Chiropractic. Very informative and it hits the nail on the head. It explains many popular misconceptions about Chiropractic. I understand how Chiropratic is much more than what you might hear on the street or worse from your medical doctor. It also explains the role of Chiropractors and how they work with medical doctors and their role is different from medicine instead of opposed to it. Great book!
3,The Temptress,"Bayard de Villone wants to protect his former home, Montvieux. His grandmother gave the seal to Montvieux to his uncle Rowan; now King Richard wants Montvieux; he sees it as an asset in his conflict wirh France and has been set to lay siege; Bayard does not want to see Montvieux or his family destroyed. King Richard has promised to make Bayard lord of Montvieux if he can wrest ownership from Rowan. Bayard pays a visit to his grandmother, Margaux, at Montvieux; she promises to take the seal from Rowan and give to Bayard if he can do one thing. Esmeraude of Ceinne-beithe is to wed the man who can complete a conquest for her; Bayard is one of the men invited for the conquest. Bayard believes this to be a simple task, and assures his grandmother that he will win. He arrives at Ceinne-beithe in all his glory, gleaming mail, fur lined cloak, silver bells jingling on his horses's harness-to find Esmeraude gone and a riddle that she has left behind for her would be suitors to solve."
3,Not as pictured,"My daughter already has the 4-scene set to use in her classroom, and the kids enjoy it, so I ordered this 6-scene set for her. The picture on Amazon shows colorful illustration sets (like the other set that she owns), but the set that we received is a different version. Apparently what we received is either an older (or newer??) version which is more like actual photos, and they are much plainer/less interesting to look at. She decided it wasn't worth the hassle of returning the item, but beware that the version you receive may not be the one that is pictured on here."
1,Awful. I give it an 'F'.(A review of the abridged audiobook),"This book gets some pretty decent reviews so...maybe it is pretty decent IF you are a fan of gratuitous, super-detailed rape scenes, splattering mists of blood and brains, barely fleshed-out government plots and revenge-driven soldiers who insanely act without cause.Admittedly, I listened to it as an abridged book on tape, however, Brannon's book is in serious need of more detail explaining the connections between the characters, including what some of these characters are doing in this plot in the first place. I was irritated at the lack of detail, but yet even more irritated at the insane amount of detail devoted to these items: 1) a visit of a 'John' to a hooker in Las Vegas; 2) an unnecessary rape and genital mutilation scene and similar descriptions of violence.In an abridgment, you should abridge the unnecessary parts, not the essential plot details!My grade for this book on tape: F"
2,Got talent but could not deliver. A head spin&dizzy reading!,"This author got talent but both of his books, LET US PREY and THE DEVIL'S HOLE, were miserable failures. Read like Joyce's THE DUBLINERs, both books made my head spin and dizzy. The plots and scenarios got lot digressions and blab,blab,blab, jumping around like a beheaded chicken with not much blood spraying around. All the contract killers in these two books were supposed to be good, but always turned out to be no-big-deal. All the characters could only give you vague and obscure impressions. Supposed to be NOTABLE, but doomed to be overlooked and disregarded"
5,Simply the purist voice you'll ever hear!,"I haven't heard a voice as pure as David Burnham's in a long, long time. He puts his heart and soul into each song and moves you with his emotion-filled passion. You'll enjoy the variety of songs he chose for his debut cd. Treat yourself to his amazing gift of music!"
3,NOT as good as they used to be,"I was down to my last pen (that was just like these) so I decided to puchase a whole box. BAD IDEA the pens I've used so far skip, and they don't write evenly. Sorry BIC but I'm changing brands!!"
5,Eggsercizer,"After being encouraged by my Rhemutologist to purchase a ""stress"" ball to help with the stiffness in my hands I saw the Eggsercizer. I purchased the blue one. The shape fits my hand perfectly and after using for 3 days I can now bend my fingers down to touch my palm!!!! I saw a few reviews that mentioned a ""smell"". I have weekly allergy shots and am bothered by ""perfumy"" and chemical smells but didn't notice either of those. I HIGHLY recommend this product, you will not be disappointed."
4,Figuring out strength,"I bought the green egg. I don't have arthritis, I just have bad handwriting, and I am hoping to improve my muscle strength. I am a female in my twenties, and I found the green to still be a good amount of resistance for me. It has a really nice feel to it, good weight, nice manipulation to it. The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because it has a funny smell. I hope that it will fade in time! Update__the smell mostly faded. My fiance wants to stop cracking his knuckles, so I ordered one for him, too."
5,Great Soundtrack for an Emperor,"This soundtrack produced for the Emperor's Club, a movie essentially about teaching, the decline of the humanities as a standard of course instruction, and the facts of life that you cannot reach every student in the way you intend during the course of a career is remarkable.The main theme is constantly variated and placed in different situations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the music applied to apects of student life.Although this CD is now somewhat scarce and out of print, anyone who has seen the movie will understand and have a desire to purchase it. Well worth the scarcity price."
5,nice,"Good remixes, goodtime listening to. I hoped for more, I like goldies originals better, but all in all worth it.."
4,Really Good Metalheadz Compilation Release,"I think it is a lot better than Metalheadz 02 (not on Amazon), which I have on vinyl.It is a lot faster and I think the tracks are a lot more addictive and appealing.It has a lot of great tracks by:Loxy and Ink, Fresh, Danny C, Total Science, Lemon D, Hidden Agenda, Rufige Kru, and Calyx and KontrolI had to take a star away however, b/c I wasn't that impressed with the mixed version (disc 2).And some tracks are just some more really old tracks like the track Angel (originally on Goldie's debut album TIMELESS)or Riders Ghost (which came out on Doc's Scott's 12"" and Metalheadz first vinyl release - Metalheadz001), which have been remixed to death already.But overall a great album and affordable. (always good.)"
2,showing wear after a year,"I bought this set a little over a year ago- not for the ""dishwasher safe"" feature, but the reviews were good and it seemed to be a good value. We never put them in the dishwasher, but the most used pieces(pans)seem to be losing their ""non-stick"" quality and luster. I would look elsewhere in the future."
5,Great pots and pans!,"I love this set. I am a ""sort of"" a gourmet cook and have had many different brands of pans. These are great! They distribute heat evenly, are non-stick, clean up is so easy and they can even go from stove top to oven. My niece wants a good set of pans and I told her I would get her what I have for her birthday (not until May of 2007). I looked up my order and I bought this set for $179.99 in June of 2006 AND I had a $25 ""Rewards"" gift certificate from Amazon. I ended up paying about $155.00. When I went to see if they were still available, they were, but now they are selling for $249.00! Yikes! Even though I think they are worth even this price (and I do have another $25 rewards coupon) I am disappointed that the price has increased by $70. I guess since I don't have to get them until May, I will keep checking back and probably check some other web sites and see if I can get them cheaper. But they are well worth the money! Excellent quality!"
2,Disappointing,"The price seemed attractive and reviews were generally favorable when I bought this set. It was fine for about six months, then a big mistake. Although I followed the instructions to use lower heat, plastic utensils, and no abrasives on these pans, washed them by hand, and even oiled the fry pan before cooking bacon, they lost their non-stick quality very soon. They also became difficult to clean. The interior black matte-finish obscures any film or particle of food that sticks to the surface, so you may think they are clean until you rub them with a dish towel. When it was uncertain whether the dark particles rubbed out of the fry pan were bits of food or the finish itself, I gave up on them. If you cook rarely, are very careful, and need cookware only for a couple of years, these might be for you. Otherwise, I'd recommend a high-quality stainless steel set."
2,Yiddish Policemen's Union fails to come to life,"Chabon disappoints with his latest ambitious novel of an imagined Jewish state in Sitka, Alaska. Where Philip Roth succeeds in The Plot Against America, Chabon's alternative history falls flat. The Yiddish Policemen's Union fails on several levels: too many tangled plot threads, heavy handed metaphors and similes choke the prose, and the weltschmerz-burdened characters do not engage. Chabon tries way too hard to be clever. As a result, the writing feels labored and inauthentic. I commend Chabon for taking on this gargantuan project -- a noir science fiction murder mystery with Jewish themes and literary aspirations. The premise is inspired. Nevertheless, for this reader -- a fan of Chabon's earlier works -- sticking out The Yiddish Policemen's Union was heavy lifting to the end."
4,You Don't Have To Be Jewish To Like This Book,"This novel is funny, entertaining, sad, and well written. The plot centers around a murder investigation in the Jewish State of Sitka. Detective Myer Landsman who lives in the hotel where the victim was found is assigned to the case. Myer is an honest cop who wants find justice for the murder victim. There's pressure from higher up to stop him. Meyer is the classic world weary detective. Time is running out for Meyer and the Jews of Sitka ( two months)before it reverts back to Alaska.If this was a film The Jewish Policemen's Union would be filmed in gray, black, white, and blue (sort of like the Blade Runner). There's a criminal Orthodox sect (black hats), a half Jewish,half Native American detective, a very, very, short Native American tribal police chief, master chess players, and other interesting characters.This off beat novel will hold your interest with it's setting, plot and characters."
2,A Tale Of Two Books,"I had heard many good things about the writer and this book, and based upon this I was looking forward to reading this work. The writer is very skillful in setting up his story as well as its setting. It is understood that a portion of any book is taken up by the writer setting up his plot line as well as introducing his characters. It is unfortunate that it takes over 200 pages for the book to begin moving its plot line with any sustained interest. I was continually asking myself, ""Why have I not put this book down?"". It is not well done at all. Aside from the three major characters, the writrt does a poor job in character development. The book finally picks up with one or two surprises existing. Numerous characters drop in and out without any real development. The book leaves much to be desired as it plods alog into mediocrty. For a good nights rest, one might wish to consider it. It an be said of this story that the juice received at the end is NOT worth the squeeze."
4,"Beautiful Writing, Interesting Premise.","Michael Chabon is an absolutely beautiful writer although I have to admit this novel for me was a bit of a mixed bag. As imaginative and creative was the 'what if' scenario the book presents, for me there was an element of removal in not being overly familiar with Jewish customs and culture.However, the story is still engaging, and his prose is like a fantastic wine bouquet that is great to wrap your mouth around,with a finish nearly as full as the first literary sip."
5,Please....ignore the bad reviews...,"With mouth agape, I just read those negative reviews. I can't believe it, no, wait, I can. The book isn't easy, it isn't full of trashy scenes of greed, sex, easily understood 4th grade vocabulary or vampires. That must be it. The minute you tell me you read it for your book club, that's the minute I know why you trashed this book. Book clubs. Can't choose your own reading or need group validation so you know what's good? Can't discern that otherwise?O.K...now for less vitriolic verbiage. This is a great novel. I used the glossary, and I used a dictionary of Yiddish terms. I am not Jewish, Alaskan or a huge fan of alternate history, but I am a huge fan of Michael Chabon! If he writes it I will come. His mind is not the usual mind, his pen is not the usual pen, and his wildly intricate thought processes fascinate."
1,The Yiddish Policeman's Union by Michael Chabon,Only because I hated to give up on the book I have read laborously through 28 chapters. I finally just decidedin spite of not knowing the meaning to most of the words I would try to find a plot. However other than puttingme quickly to sleep every time I try to read it it has become a challenge even finding a plot. If you don't know anything about Jews or Chess it is not a book that a you would enjoy reading. I think the people who say that they enjoyed it are Jewish Chess players just trying to make you think that they are intellectuals. Noone could possibly have enjoyed this terribly written book. If this is one of the best books of 2007 I would not want to getnear any of the worst! A complete disappointment!
3,"An often dark, sometimes funny, thoroughly entertaining mystery","I throughly enjoyed the book. It started out a bit slow, but I got sucked in pretty quickly. I would describe it as an often dark, sometimes funny, thoroughly entertaining mystery novel. And I liked the chess angle, too.I'm a bit confused by all the complaints about the Yiddish-isms. I'm not Jewish. I don't speak a word of Yiddish. And, frankly, I'm not all that familiar with the Jewish culture. But I had no problem understanding the Yiddish-isms in their context."
4,A Good Read,This is a very engaging novel built upon an interesting concept that keeps you sucked in. There is a lot of humor to be had and it is a clear throwback to noir fiction of the early 40's. Anyone who is looking for a good mystery would be hard pressed to find a better one than The Yiddish Policemen's Union.
2,Dark and Disappointing,"I tried very hard to get through this audiobook, but could not reconcile myself to one more minute of the narrator's voice. The story was intriguing enough, though a few shades too dark for my taste. My advice--if you like the author, forego the audio and buy the book."
3,Could have been much better,"First of all, this book is far from my favorite style. But I gave it a vote since the author is so well awarded.This book is based on pure fiction events of a possible political world situation if the Nazis had caused much more disgrace than they had and also that a nuke had hitted Germany.Tha said it states that the jews would not have Israel. Inside this plot the author evolves it story.Personally, I didn't like the ways it was written due to the fact that lots of references are made for the jewish comunity and I don't know nothing about it. My fault.Besides that, the plot itself is intersting, but could have much more pace. The wrtter in many ways focus on so many small details and gives too much attention to it at some point that I almost quit reading the book.If it had more pace and more focus it would be much better!! For me at least ;-) Either way, it is a good book."
2,not my kind of mystery,"I prefer books where the language does not call attention to itself. Chabon does use eloquent phrases, but they bog down the story."
2,"Almost finished it, but wondered why I spent my time","I loved Kavalier & Clay and really wanted to read this, but wow--what a difference. First, one really needs a Yiddish dictionary to weed through this. Secondly, I found it just plain confusing. Each time I picked it up to read, I would have to go back and reread parts to remember what had happened. Lastly, and I don't mind depressing novels, but this one just seemed cynical, dark, and as if the author was toying with the reader.Must admit, there were some times, I found the writing interesting and visual, but overall, just sorry I wasted my time when there are so many other titles that are on my list to read. (I gave up on this with only about 80 pages left, a rare occurrence, but I finally admitted defeat)."
3,Not a great read.,"Chabon's latest isn't a bad book, but given some of the hype, it's notably a struggle to read. The topic is an interesting one, but the story doesn't flow particularly well, most of the characters aren't particularly well-drawn or compelling, and the development of the protagonist's relationships seems a little thin given the assumed depth of past trauma. In the end, there are lots of interesting nuggets that don't add up to a great story."
2,I Won't be reading Michael Chabon anymore,"I read and enjoyed ""Kavalier and Clay"", but this book was difficult for me to read and understand. The hebrew words and vernacular were unfamilar. A brief included glossary would have been very helpfull . I found myself thumbing back to reread parts in order to follow the story. This is especially true of Chapter 39, which gave no indication that a flashback was worked in. Also, the constant comic repartee and wisecracks was badly overdone, I thought.Jack H Bryan"
3,Just good. Not great.,"Too often, reading this book felt more like something I was willing myself to do because of Chabon devotion rather than something I wanted to do. About 3/4 through it started to spark, but it never really fired.That said, it's still far better written than anything you can buy at the airport.Missing Kavalier and Clay, LOVING that book jacket."
2,Disappointing,"I wanted to like this book, based on the wonderful reviews. I did enjoy the first few chapters, but the story kept getting bogged down and after several attempts to finish the book, I gave up. Another reviewer said that this was not a typical mystery, so maybe that is what I was looking for."
2,A Book you can pass,"The title is catchy and different enough that you just may want to read this book.I suffered through it. I did not think it was funny, nor did I think it was particularly clever.The author tried very hard to be novel and creative, and he succeeded in that aspect alone; but,novelty and creativity does not necessarily produce a book worth reading, and that is certainly the case with this book."
2,Largely impenetrable,"Having not grown up in a Jewish area, and not being Jewish myself, I found this book to be a very hard slog. There would be a term on every single page which I couldn't understand. I worked with a dictionary at my side for about half the book and then gave up. The author makes little effort to explain the unique items, behaviours and traditions in the Jewish community where this novel takes place. If you are familiar with the culture, it may not bother you.Putting aside this road block, the book was well written and had decent characters."
2,Slow,"Once you put it down, you can't pick it back up. Almost a history of Jewish persecution and a downtrodden outlook on life."
2,Disappointing,"I picked this book up based on the positive reviews. I have to say that the writing has very limited flow. As another reviewer has said, enough with the ""yid"" word! I read about 350 pages of the 410 pages in the book. I just coulnd't sit with the story any longer.I gave it two stars because at least the premise of the story was interesting.Perhaps I was tainted by the last book I read, "" A Thousand Splendid Suns"", which was far and away superior in every way to this novel."
3,The Yiddish Policemens Union,"Unless you understand Yiddish you are in deep water.Also,some explinations are too long.It caused me to lose the point of the issue.""The Yiddish Policemens Union"""
4,Engaging alternate universe with Jews,"I have been very impressed with Chabon, esp. The Amazing C&K;, but his work can tend to bloat a bit. That is the case with this novel as well, but boy, what a world he has imagined for us! The post-WWII Jews have been settled in Alaska, not Israel, and Chabon sets us at the center of a murder investigation of the son of a famous Hassidic rabbi, whose murdered son ranged far from the fold.Just a bang-up job in general, but again like with C&K; it is draggy in the second half."
4,"Harry Bosch, Lucas Davenport,.......Meyer Landsman?","What a refreshing novel. You have murder, action, alternative history, the intricacies of Jewish culture, and faith, plus geography. Oh, also, humor, and sadness. Did I miss anything? This was my first Michael Chabon novel, certainly not my last. The tale is a colossal accomplishment that is without a doubt UNIQUE."
3,Don't see the humor...,"But that didn't stop me from enjoying the book. The Yiddish here and there threw me off for a bit, but thankfully the glossary in the back cleared any issues up and quickly. An excellent throwback to noir while at the same time having the alternate history element."
3,Great writer. Disappointing novel.,"Michael Chabon is a fabulous novelist and two of his books are great works - ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay"" and ""Wonder Boys"". However, The Yiddish Policemen's Union fails to clear the high bar set by his previous novels. Chabon cobbles together an interesting detective story, but the setting in an alternate history sabotages an otherwise inviting tale. The Jewish-Alaskan environment probably sounded irresistible when first conceived, but it ultimately trips the effort.Kasey Cotulla[...]Sacramento."
4,Odd choices but you can't argue with the music,".This CD is mostly tracks from Bish's first two albums, plus a couple of themes from movies.Nothing wrong with that I guess. You can't argue with the quality of the music. Many of us grew up on those first two albums and hold them in great affection. They are, justifiably, classics.The theme from Animal House is hardly recognizable as Bish, and really just a novelty on here, while the theme from ""Tootsie"" fits in nicely, even if Bish didn't write it himself.Trouble is, this collection offers nothing new, so perhaps you'd be better sticking with the original albums while they're still available, or grabbing Bish's excellent new stuff from his website."

A must for the Microsoft Applications programmer, and the beginner as well."
3,Pretty Good Disc for those who like Country and Punk,"If you like your punk with a twang, than pick this up"
2,not Johnny Cash -- maybe John Cougar Mellencamp,"This isn't country and it's not punk; it's what critics call meat and potatoes rock n' roll, and what I refer to as a boring slog. The vocals are mediocre, the riffs are recycled, and the lyrics are, at best, moderately clever. Even the enthusiasm seems second-hand -- I felt like they were constantly nudging me to tell me what a good time they were having. Their proletarian posturing isn't quite as good as Bruce Springsteen's, but if you like John Mellencamp, there's no reason you shouldn't enjoy this."
1,"Thank God, someone else with good taste","Glad to fine out some other discriminating viewers found this movie to be embarrassing for everyone involved, the actors, i.e, Mitchum and Winters as well as the script writer, Mr. Agee."
1,Night of the Hunter - Disapointing,"After reading the good reviews on this page I thought I'd check out this movie only to be disappointed by what I watched.I found the acting to be poor, with barely believable characters. The plot was thin with sickeningly moralistic overtones.This is by far the worst film I have seen in a long time.A waste of time and money (just my opinion folks!)"
5,Plenty of Bang for Your Buck!,"I was absolutly blown away by Aterciopelados beautiful rendition of one of my favirote Jose Alfredo Jimenez tunes, ""Que Te Vaya Bonito"". It brings a whole other dimension to the song. Fantastic.Another knockout is ""Serenata a la luna"" done to perfection by Julieta Venegas. It makes me itch even more to hear her new album. Other notables include El Tri, Saul Hernandez, Ana Belen and King Chango. This album I believe is important, as it reintroduces the young generations to Jose Alfredo, who was the greatest composer of all time in my book. I hope that this will prompt young ones to seek out their grandparents records, and acquiant themselves with the one who helped shape Latin music as we know it today, perhaps more than anyone else."
2,TRIBUTO AL DESASTRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Creo que este tributo pudo ser mucho mejor, la verdad cuenta con demasiadas participaciones, que termina siendo casi un desastre musical, una verdadera lastima porque las canciones de uno de los mejores compositores mexicanos, JOSE ALFREDO JIMENEZ, no se merecia este casi desastre musical, se puede ver claramente que el objetivo de la disquera era vender el producto a toda costa, lo cual me parece bastante ridiculo a estas alturas, cuando se han generado millones de ventas de los discos de jose alfredo, bueno retomando las participaciones que me parecen bastante buenas y recomendables son: JUMBO/LA LUNA, MOENIA, SAUL Y ELEFANTE,BUNBURY, este ultimo fue removido de la edicion de estados unidos, que me parece bastante mal, que lastima que este tributo no sea como el de hace cuatro anos atras a jose jose, bastante malo, mejor escuchenlo antes de comprarlo."
3,"Before there was Goku, there lived his father Bardock.","Before there was Goku, there lived his father Bardock. A low-class Saiyan soldier under the command of Frieza, Bardock is attacked by the last of an alien race they are employed in destroying. Healing on his home planet of Vegeta, Bardock discovers he has been with the ability to see into the future."
5,Got Bellydance Superstars? GO GET IT! THE BEST...,"GREATEST BELLYDANCE ALBUM EVER and out of this world...nothing compares to how good it is. You should go get it too and dance non-stop to it. The album is great all around, and the songs are just awesome one after another.Now I could finally really dance to a great album.CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL THE BELLYDANCERS, GREAT JOB!!Is there going to be a BELLYDACANCE SUPERSTARS 2? I can't wait!!"
4,Bellydance superstar 1 and 2,I love these cd's. I haven't been belly dancing long but I have depended on these for when I dance at the zoo's annual Halloween party. I have had good reviews from the other people around me. Now I have purchased the 3rd. I can't wait.
4,Great battery,"The battery works really well. Just remember to give it a 12 hour charge before you use it for the first time! It took a few days for the battery to reach its full charge potential, but after a week its working as well as a new battery would!"
1,Disapointing,Ridiculously cheep!.... the whole thing was made from plastic and the interchangeable heads are lame... they dont show up very well... I havent been able to see the others because it broke within 2 minutes of taking it out of the box. Over all it was what you paid for.
2,Pass this book up,"It does give you step by step on how to complete these projects; but it will cost you. Example telescope tracker parts list runs about $900, then you can connect it to a PC. Build a PVR uses a P3933 with 512MB ram. I don't have one of those sitting on a shelf. This cook book shows you what software to buy, cables and plug and play modules, but does not teach anything. I guess I wanted to solder something. Please try to find a copy and flip through it before you buy it."
5,very detailed very usefull!!,Autimatically when i baught shamen king power of spirit i knew that i would not need help but when i baught master of spirits that game was fun but difficult the guide shows where all the chests are where to go and how to beat bosses along with how to get to certain things and it tells you about shamen king so if you need any help pick up this stratedgy guide.
4,Very good first album!,"I've just come from seeing these folks live in Wichita, and bought the CD immediately. It's a fine piece of bluegrass, with a cutting edge to it (and, occasionally, a little nasty). Nothing pretentious in either the album or the band members, just good music and a lot of fun to listen to."
2,A BIG RIP OFF!!!!!!!!,"Hey, I love Chaka & have all of her CDs, but this is a BIG RIP OFF from Warner Brothers!!! The only RARE remixes on this OVERPRICED import CD are the Extended Vocal Mix for 'Tearin It Up', and an instrumental mix of the same song!! All of the other songs are not hard to find, and they aren't even remixes for the most part!!Don't waste your money on this!!! TRUST ME!!!! Peace S.D. from 'Chaka's World'"
2,"good idea, but...","While the idea behind this book was good, the reality of being in the poorest working classes was missed. The author did not have children, did not have day care issues, had her credit cards and her bank account as a back up. Most, if not all, of the people she worked with and wrote about do not have this type of support. When she got a rash, she called her dermatologist - the working poor do not even have a doctor, let alone a dermatologist.The author set a time frame of one month per job, anybody who is in the desparate sitation described, would be held to that job for years. They would not have the luxury of simply walking away. Most people in this position end up working at entry level jobs for many, many years. They have to make sure that there is a paycheck so that at least some of the basic needs of life are met.While it does give a bit of insight into the lives of these workers, it falls short in painting the true picture."
4,"a sobering, embittered account...","this book will vindicate the socialist in you. ;o) in barbara ehrenreich's experiences as a minimum-wage-earner, you get a sense of the hopelessness and degradation that fill the lives of the working poor. her writing is entertaining but thoughtful, reflecting the dead-end work opportunities open to the uneducated and the 'unskilled.' it made me mad, reading about the disregard for human well-being the author encountered during her research. i suppose you can see it yourself ever day, if you bother to look close enough."
4,Enjoyable Book,Nickel and Dimed is interesting and entertaining. The book gives a look into the pink collar ghetto without being condescending or preachy. It is also an easy read while keeping the reader interested.
3,Low-wage occupations,"I would recommend this book to anyone interested in finding out how low-wage workers truly live. Ehrenreich risked her life in finding out how working class individuals live day to day, most without safe living conditions or healthy diets. She gives detailed explanations of her jobs in Key West, Portland, and Minneapolis; describing the process of hiring that is considerably different from middle or upper class occupations. The scientific rules that she set in the beginning were not obeyed, in fact she broke every single one. In becoming a low-wage worker she has expanded the view on how these workers are treated and shows how society needs to become more aware and accepting of these people."
5,Book,"The book was on the reading list for my 9th grader for ""summer reading"". I ordered the book and it arrived quickly and was in fine condition."
1,What an odd book,"What an odd book (actually I listened to the CD version). Too often demeaning, less empathtic, mostly an overtone of distance.Also, maybe this task would have been best done by someone, who either through self, family, or friends, had been touched by poverty, or Alzheimers. Poverty is not a swimming pool you can put your toe in and feel satisfied you know the temperature."
3,Interesting but unbalanced,"I though this book was interesting, but it would have had more impact if it wasn't so one-sided. Were ALL of the workers truly honorable, hard working and oppressed, and were ALL of the employers truly stingy and mean spirited? I don't think so. There was almost nothing about the poor lifestyle choices some people made that were responsible (at least in part) for their being in these dead end jobs. The author went into this experiment with an agenda and seemed to ignore events that didn't fit in with her preconceived ideas. I'm glad I read it, but I don't have any desire to seek out other books by this author."
4,Nickel and Dimed--an interesting perspective,"I am just finishing up this book and I am impressed that the author at least tried to see what it is like to be a member of the working poor. She acknowledges that she can't truly emulate all of the circumstances that the working poor would encounter, but I give her an ""A"" for effort in trying to bring the topic out into the public spotlight."
2,Major Flaw,"The main issue I took with this book was that Ehrenreich refused to try to get any higher paying job that required a drug test, because she wasn't willing to give up on recreational marijuana smoking. She even tries to justify that this is acceptable, because many of the working poor escape into drugs. When she finally does try to get a job a Wal-Mart she researches how to beat the drug test. I can't feel sorry for someone who wants to break the law. Ehrenreich doesn't spend too much time delving into ways to see how people can escape from poverty on their own; all she offers is the utopian idea of a heightened minimum wage. People do escape poverty by attending school, they go to community colleges, they get grants and scholarships. People up to their 30's can join the military and learn job skills and money for school. Ehrenreich never gives these ideas any thought, because it would apparently be better to smoke up and get a handout from the government."
1,She thinks Amy Tan is high literature (and other unintended laughs),"I couldn't stand this book. Here's an especially telling passage where she is describing the clothing sold in WalMart:"" ... sexless Russ and Bobbie Brooks lines, seemingly aimed at pudgy fourth-grade teachers with important barbeques to attend.""Oh, nice, trashing educators! Education is the KEY to avoiding the desperate lives being described. And as to her PhD, if she's so smart why is she using illegal drugs AT ALL, especially when a drug test is in her future? Dummy."
5,Good for Undergraduate Classes,"I have my undergraduates read part of this book (and some go on to read the rest). Many of my students don't initially appreciate how difficult many adults and children have it. Because many of my students are going to be teachers working in high poverty schools, it is important that they understand the issues that low wage workers have. This book's personalized account, written from the point of view of someone who otherwise is not a low wage worker, helps them bridge the gap between their own limited experience and low income families more easily. I wish there was a follow-up."
1,Her prejudiced attitudes are part of why low-end jobs are so hard,"The economic part of this book was not even worth exploring -everybody knows it's really a struggle to get by on low wagejobs. Her descriptions of how demoralizing it is to be treatedlike a non-entity by wealthy people were more interesting,however, she seems to have really missed the point, because itwas clear throughout the book that she truly considered hercoworkers beneath her. She even considered her identity as""Barb"" at Walmart to be an inferior person to ""Barbara"" - hermore affluent self."
3,A little too much Barbara,"Though I am glad I read this book, I was disappointed by the authors' self-centered writing. The people she works with seem like mere extras, although they are the real experts on the subject. Additionally, I was surprised that Ehrenreich did not follow the advice (to find a church) given to her by a contact in Minnesota who had previously been in a similarly difficult situation. I can't remember much other direct, practical advice that is related in this book, and yet Ehrenreich fails to follow that piece of advice. The book was worth reading, but it seemed like the author could have done much better."
4,great book,"I thought this book was wonderfully written and a completely realistic look into the world of living on minimum wage.Some people reviewed this book as being unrealistic because they thought that the people in the book didn't live happy fulfilling lives due to their lifestyles (smoking pot and excessively drinking). The majority of the people in the book lived simple lives and still could not get by.The personal lives of the workers in this book had nothing to do with them getting by. No matter what their circumstances were, everyone was struggling to survive.This book was an eye-opening look into the world of long term minimum wage ""working poor."""
2,Disappointing,"I started Nickel and Dimed with high expectations because I had hear such good reviews. I was in for a major let down. I did not feel sympathetic as the narrator ""struggled"" through her low income life. She complained constantly and showed an eagerness to quite when something got tough. She never settled into any one job or place, creating extra hardships of constantly being the ""new girl"".I think the author meant well in her attempts to show how the lower class lives however, her endeavor fell flat, leaving the reader unsatisfied."
2,Reality Check: it's not really that bad.,"I disagree with the findings of this book. I'm poor. I started off working at 7.20 per hour at the job I have now. I opted to live with roommates to save money, rather than live alone as Erenreich does. I worked really hard, asked for raises and now I make 10.85. I live quite comfortably, I have enough money to go to school and go out. This book essentially says that America is a bad place to live. This is far from the truth. Ehrenreich should go try the same experiment in Ethiopia and then she might have a different opinion about America."
2,Not good,"The seller blamed it on the slow mail, but the book didn't show up until after the estimated date."
2,"Good basis, bad delivery.","The idea of the book itself is tremendous but the author really ruined it for me to the point that every 10 pages I was turning to my girlfriend to tell her how arrogant the author is. Along with her constant references to how lean, fit, and strong she is, was her constant elitist demeanor. Instead of describing the people she worked with she described what is was like for her. When I finished I thought that the thesis was more pointed to how a wealthy women lives on minmum wage for a month.If anyone wants to see a more interesting protrayal of life on minimum wage I suggest watching the first episode of 30 days. I know its a movie but its really good."
4,The Invisible Americans,"I found Nickel and Dimed to be a good book. I read it for my ESL class and it helped me to improve my vocaburaly even though it was so hard at the beginning. It was amazing to realize how some Americans being Americans - as Barbara said in Nickel and Dimed - being white, English speakers, struggle in their own land with an unreasonable economic system. Barbara shows very well how poor workers are unable to live with their wages. The working class experience incredible and some times inhuman circumstances just to survive. Nickel and Dimed shows some of the terrible working conditions, and the result of them in most of those workers. It shows also how the same system is designed - in my opinion - not to help and assist these people."
4,Great buy,It was in fantastic shape. It arrived right on time. I would gladly do business with them again. I recommend them to anyone who is looking to buy good used books!
5,Amazing,"I didn't expect this book to be any good, but it really surprised me with all the twists and turns. I haven't read a nonfiction book like this in a long time"
3,disappointed for many reasons,"i looked forward to reading this book because of all the good reviews. it was a good book but i felt that the author was very condecending in her tone when she was writing this. she also had an ""out"" when the going got rough, so can it really be an accurate look at this part of society?the most trying part of this book was the editing. this woman is a PhD. did no one edit her? there were so many grammatical errors, particularly ending sentances in a preposition that it became distracting to me while reading."
5,Good book; both interesting and informative,This book is easy to read because the author tells her story of her experience with working in low paying jobs and trying to get by on such a low salary. It is a must read for anyone who wants a better understanding of the working poor people in the US.
2,Just the Basics,"Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America, written by Barbara Ehrenreich, is a well-written book. However, this book should only be used just for the basics to learn about those who work at low-paying jobs. This book does not cover the major and fastest growing of poor people, which is working single mothers who work at the low-paying jobs. Since the welfare reform of 1996 a lot of mothers are working at some of these low-paying jobs that Barbara Ehrenreich has based her research on. I wonder how those mothers get by. If Ehrenreich have done a section on that, then the readers who have gotten a more of a perspective on what is really going on. She could have based her research on interviews of single working mothers who have kids to support."
1,Condescending,Barbara Ehrenreich seems to have gotten it all wrong. It appears as though she learned nothing on her journey. Not to mention the continuous use of classist and racist ideas. This book gets two thumbs down from me.
1,liberal barbie goes camping,"the overwelming impression I got from reading this book is that this upscale, phd'ed (as we are constantly reminded), neo-socialist reporter spent three months playing at being poorand we get a book ?3 suggestions for our erstwhile writer1) ancedotal evidence is not evidence, and gets tiresome2) personal spite is not a substitute for a lack of ANY facts3) nobody cares about your personal journeydon't waste your time, or money, on this book"
3,Book was received in timely manner but was not received in the condition as described in the product description.,"Book was received in timely manner but was not received in the condition as described in the product description.Front cover and first 1/8th of the pages were water damaged. The book was delivered to the Midwest during a time when winter weather was your typical Wisconsin weather, the packaging was poor which caused for damage to the book.I wish we would have spent a few dollars more and just purchased new rather than trying to save some money as the end result was disappointing."
1,Nicel and Dimed review,"The idea behind this book sounded very interesting. However, the way the author has written the book doesn't provide much more information than what we already know. The author did a half assed job in her experiment. The author could have gotten the same information just by making a few simple phone calls. The author really didn't provide us with information that we don't already know."
3,Workers of the World Unite,"The book is a well written account of the author's experiences in several low wage level jobs. Makes you not want to pursue a carreer as a house cleaner, waitress...etc.I enjoyed (""enjoyed"" may not be the operative word ) the book, and underlined a lot to use in discussions with some of my more free market oriented friends. I definitely will always leave tips for the housekeepers at hotels, and urge my friends to do likewise. The author paints a pretty bleak picture of the low income worker's lot in life. I did find the author's tying her experience into her living situations where she tried to make ends meet by leaving in cheap motels kind of a stretch. She didn't need that aspect to paint the picture she was painting. Finally, I think the book is a good reality check for those enjoy their upper middle class lifestyles and just cannot seem to sympathize with those who do have the get up and go to achieve a similar life style for themselves."
3,Doesn't seem realistic,"I have not finished this book yet but if the lady did the study in 1998, I can't believe that the rent cost so much 10 years ago. She is talking about living in some small rundown place for $500.00 a month back in 1998. If you were making minimum wage, how could you rent a place for $500.00 a month. Most of the hourly rate of pays that she makes are not much different than our minimum wage now. It just doesn't seem realistic and from what I have read so far it doesn't seem like she had it that bad while she was working these jobs. It is not as good as I thought it would be."
2,Not good,"I had to read this book for class...I found a very unaccurate potrayl of poverty, Ehrenreich only keeps jobs for a month, quits when the going gets tough, and does not fully emerse herself in a low-class society."
1,Aren't There Any Editors Any More?,I'd like to give this book a zero star rating but unfortunatly for us this isn't an option. This so called research project and its resulting insult is just about the most selfserving piece of work I have read in years. I'd call it complete dripple except that its too insulting to too many hard working people and the people who appreciate and even rely on them. This book actually does harm. Barb is either self-centered at best or an out and out bigot at worst and since she takes so many fortuitous pot shots I'm betting on the latter. Spreading ones condescension around does not make for fair play. And who let this stuff get out there? Where's the editorial staff? Shame on all of you.
1,Playing dress-up,"I found the idea interesting, but I don't think her personal approach was at all appropriate. Firstly, she bunked her entire ""project"" from the very beginning with her own ""rules"" as outlined in the introduction. Secondly, and what I found disturbing was that she had a paranoid, sometimes completely insulting point of view about her jobs, cowokers, customers, managers, and society in general that she found necessary to fill the pages. When she wasn't filling the pages with propaganda and her personal woes, she was relaying information that was completely useless to the book's purpose (i.e. the types of stains left by fecal matter.) The obvious biases, stereotypes, and condescensions the author had toward the ""working poor"" were also a taint on the book's premise. Frankly, if you must read this book for any reason, I recommend the library, as it is not worth the paper it's printed on."
4,Nickel and Dimed,"This was a very insightful book. It gives the reader a closer look at what some people have to go through each day of their lives. This book gave me a new found respect for the sacrifices some people make just to survive. In this book, Barbara Ehrenreich attempts to show how life is really like living in a low-wage America. After reading it, it made me appreciate all the things I take for granted every day. Simple things such as not worrying if I will have enough to pay for rent next month, I take for granted where other people struggle to have enough money for food. Nickel and Dimed gave me a better understanding of how hard it is to find a job requiring no skill that gives a living wage."
1,not good enough,"My daughter, who's really good at this stuff, could never getr the software that comes with it to work right, so she had to use different software. And 18 months later it's falling apart, with the jacks loose and staticy."
4,Intellligent and Moving,Incredibly smart and moving story of an autistic student in Belgium. He's bullied and hounded nearly to suicide by his classmates before he gets help from a girl and his family. High production values on a tiny budget helped out by a tie-in to a real S.Korean video game. Top notch writing and acting. This gem left the sophisticated audience at the Palm Springs International Film Festival applauding.
1,I need more info about book and author before I'd buy it.,I need more info about the book and author before I'd buy it.
1,boring book but has the info for the class...,...however there are a few pages missing. It is as if some pages were deleted from the electronic copy before it went to press.
1,Much ado about nothing.,"Mr. Ben-Ariel (that's not his real name) has spent his whole life trumping up a fairytale of racism, sexism, and spiritual waste in the hopes of promoting the Philadelphia Church Of God's cult. This rag book is a perfect example of what happens when cult members find enough money to publish their lies.Don't bother, it's not worth it. Try the Bible instead."
5,A brilliant melodrama,"Possibly Welles' most underrated role. His performance is simply superb, as are the others in the cast. Also watch for Natalie Wood, astonishingly accomplished in this role that required that she perfect a foreign accent, and show a trememdous range of emotion at the age of what, perhaps 5 or 6? Claudette Colbert shows why she was one of the top female actresses of her era and beyond. Dialogue a bit overdone in one or two places, but the rest of the film and Welles are so excellent this minor flaw is easy to forgive. A great melodrama, at the level of ""Random Harvest,"" and very few others. How can this not be a dvd???"
4,Excellent classic type B&W movie,"I don't think this is one of the best classic B&W movies I've ever seen but it is certainly a good story and well presented. I had a problem with Orson Welles as the romantic lead - the young husband off to war,etc. I just didn't think he fit the part but maybe I've seen him in too many other roles very different from this. Also, I thought there just wasn't enough difference in his appearance when he returned for her not to know him especially after being around him for a while and listening to him talk. Voices always give it away even with some sort of accent added. His voice was very much the same. I expected her to suspect that it was him from the very first time she saw him. But maybe 20 years does dim the memory a lot. All in all, I would recommend this film to anyone who loves old B&W dramatic movies. It deserves a place in my movie library."
4,Listen to this album.,"Horace Silver, the King of ""Hard Bop,"" leads his awesome quintet on this must-hear album. Each of the tracks is outstanding in its own right, but the gems are ""St Vitus Dance,"" ""Peace,"" and of course the Silver standard, ""Sister Sadie."" Wonderful stuff, folks."
5,This one was *even* better than the first (also good!).,"I read this in a couple of days, and I must say that the schmuck who wrote the review below (""Not Again!"" was the title) was full of it. This book is only similar to the first because it has another gift being sent out to someone. Otherwise, it is *totally* different than the first, and is even pretty *scary* at times. I eagerly await #3, which I take will be even better. I can tell newcomers to this serial book this much: DO NOT LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS OF BOOKS!"
4,Good calender for the Iron Chef fan...,"If you are a true Iron Chef fan, buy this calender. A small note: The pictures and info on the calender are not original; they come straight out of the Iron Chef book. Nonetheless, if you truly enjoy the exploits of Japan's greatest chefs, buy it...allez cuisine!"
5,excellent product,these rods are comparable to those of 4-5 times the cost...........i was a ugly stick user for many years and now these and the lightning rods are all i use.lightweight and durable.i use them for everything from catfish to snook to soft shell turtle......................wonderful product
2,Puke,"What a pack of lies this title is! Beautiful Music for Christmas? Yeah right! It's horrid. I guess I should be forgiven for thinking that an Xmas CD from Varese Sarabande would have might have (should have) been enchanting. What we actually get is far, far from it.This entire CD is filled sleazy 70's midwestern folk music that isn't even of truck stop hotel lobby winebar band quality. This CD is dripping with so much sleaze I'm amazed I managed to hold onto it long enough to get it in my DVD player.Shame on Varese for producing this. Shame, shame, shame! An utterly bog-standard CD that ought to be on sale at 99c in the bargain bucket next to the checkout at your local supermarket.'Holiday Magic' indeed. Puh-lease!"
3,Dissapointing,"I give this CD a 3 only because the songwriting and singing are very good. It is however overproduced to the point of giving it an almost generic Nashville sound.Chris is hugely talented in my opinion but its wasted on this CD.If your new to Chirs Knight then save your money on this one and buy either his self titled CD or ""A Pretty Good Guy"" both are outstanding."
4,Leakleakleeeak brothers.,"""I got a monkey on my back with 2 gats, bi-polar, and a headless angel laying dead on my shoulder.""Let me say that the only material I've heard from Cage was on ""movies for the blind"" and ""weather proof"", but Im about this "" "" close to placing this album at the top of that list. I don't know what it is about ""waterworld"", it just completly absorbs me. Some of the lyrics are the most bizaree I've ever heard. Both mcs are on point during the whole trip and compliment each other damn well.Ashbare Rating: 3.5/5.0"
2,Not the ska-core outing i had hoped for...,"The O.C. Supertones are back with the new album chase the sun, an album I've been looking forward to for almost 2 years. I am completely dissapointed. This album makes use of several things that just do NOT sound right on a ska cd including: rap references (the chours of the title track has ""My people where ya from? The Mighty West Side"" and another song has ""Woo-Ha!"" as it's chours), gospel singers, organs, an almost 60's sound on Revolution, and most annoying of all, NO ENERGY! The previous Supertones albums had me jumping all over the place. (including concerts, I've seen the Tones 7 times to date) This one just doesn't cut it as a high energy make me wanna skank n' jump ska album. If you are looking for a christian rock cd, this is a good one to buy, however, if you're looking for a great christian ska album go buy a Five Iron frenzy cd."
4,"Chasing the Sun is a ""Sure Shot""","Buying the Chase the Sun CD would be a great addition to your CD collection. The songs are upbeat and uplifting and give Christians another way to praise our Lord. I give the CD a 9 for musical style and a 10 for fun. The Supertones have managed to produce an uplilfting album with an effective message and a catchy beat. The only thing I would change on CD is that there are only a few slow songs. Maybe one or two. It needs a little more variety as far as the tempo. That isn't to downplay the CD at all,though. Chasing the Sun is jam-packed with awesome songs that are better for jumpstarting your mornings than a cup of supercaffeniated coffee. Go Buy Chase the Sun, your radio will never be the same."
3,"Not punk /ska ,but still good","This is not punk/ska.Its a good mix of ska(yes their is a difference between ska and punk/ska),reggae,and surf rock(with a bit of punk,surf punk,and alternative mixed in).This sounds nothing like old Supertones but is still good.This album was engineered by Darren Grahn(Bryan Adams,Metallica)which I think is a definent plus.On the downside,the Supertones replaced their awesome old guitarist(Kevin Chen)with Brian Johnson and altogether dropped their sax player(Dave Chevalier),which altered their sound even more.Also,the title track,""Chase the Sun"",gets rather old.In my opinion,this album is worth having but not worth buying(so in other words I'll just have a friend of mine burn his copy for me).For the most part,CHASE THE SUN is a well done album full of upbeat,enjoyable, rythems.I personally enjoyed ""Hallelua"",""Away From You"",""Old Friend"",""One Voice"",and ""Dedication"" the best,although most all were good."
5,Awesome,This has to be the best CD I have ever heard. It is awesome. I would recommend it to anybody.
2,Not very exciting,"The baby does have a soft lavender scent that lasted about one month. Just a regular baby in a carrier that is a little difficult for a small hand to carry since the cloth cover seems to overcome the grip area. Kids played with it for the day and have not touched in over 3 weeks. Another waste of money. I spent about $400 on 2 girls this past Christmas and probably next year will spend maybe half that since half the money I spent just sits on the floor or on a shelf. I think these days with so much marketing to a young audience, parents feel they must buy everything the child asks for...I think I'll stick to maybe 3-4 gifts at Christmas now....too much wasted money that could go into a college fund!!"
4,Good Gum; Inaccurate List Price,"The actual list price for a pack of this gum is around $2.20, not $54.96 (the price for a case). Perhaps they will fix this error.The gum itself is nice and licorice-y. Good for your teeth, too."
4,Canon Battery,These batteries are fine. I have two of them and they work and charge as well as my other batteries.Arrived on time.
4,Seems to work fine,"Its a battery, it works and it fits my camera. A little more staying power then the orginal Radio Shack unit. Not much more to say."
2,The writing isn't good,This book was chosen by our priest (Episcopal) for discussion.I am now thinking of changing churches.The writing itself is typical of an author writing opinions for which he has no provenance.He makes a statement( more conjecture than anything else) and then paraphrases it a number of times in the hope that redundancy will make it more believable.There are a number of books contemplating the early life of Jesus that make better reading.
4,Anakin Skywalker's final days as a Padawan,"David Sherman did a good job in the writing of this book. The story line was lacking a little for me, but Mr. Sherman did a good job with bringing us into the complicated mind of Anakin.We get to see Anakin Skywalker in action without the assistance of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin is dispatched by the Jedi Council to the planet Praesitlyn along with Jedi Master Halcyon to defend against the Separatist force, which is led by Pors Tornith. This serves as Anakin's jedi trial to determine if he is ready/worthy to be called a Jedi Knight. He passes with flying colors.If I had my wish with this book we would have learned a little more about Master Halcyon and Pors Tornith. It would also have ended with Anakin being formally recognized as a Jedi Knight.This is a good read for die-hard Star Wars fans, however if you are only a casual reader there are much better Star Wars books for you to read."
1,Stupid Book,"This was the worst Star Wars Book ever. I wanted Anakin to kill everyone. Nejaa Halycon was not nearly the Jedi I thought he should be because I have read so much of his grandson Corran Horn. This booked bored me. This was the one time I wanted the droids to win. Save your money, if you want to read it, get it from your local library."
5,A good book on structural mechanics,I really like this book. It help me a lot in additional knowledge in structural mechanics. It gives a very good approach on the energy method as well as the calculus of variations. Although i would not recommend this book for studying about calculus of variations (not a book for beginner`s in this field). The book gives good details about beams (and other not so well known theories and approaches for solutions) and also plates. It deals with shear deformation as well as buckling. This book is recommended not only for civil engineering students but also for mechanical engineering. The book also provided basics for finite element analysis. But the approach of the discussion for the FEM should not be considered for an introductory course. All in all for what i`m looking for this book (mainly about plates) it is fairly complete. It is a very good book and very satisfying to read.
2,"Cold, yes, but...","Solomon's is a well-written book that begs the question: How many ways are there to say that it is cold in winter at Antarctica?Solomon builds a molehill of meteorological data that pales in comparison to mountains of other evidence. Scott's lack of provisions, inadequate marking of depots, splitting of teams, depoting of ski and evaporation of stored fuel are not the only problems with his journey.Scott apologists lay the journey's failure and death of the party on the bad weather encountered at the end. They fail to note that 2 companions had already died by the last encampment and the last (Evans) party barely made it back 3 weeks earlier (for the same reasons listed above).The sheer fact of the matter is, that on a journey of over FOUR MONTHS, Scott had barely FOUR DAYS of extra rations for a job requiring 5000 calories per man per day.A 3% margin of error in the coldest, windiest, least hospitable corner of the globe is hoping on more than luck..."
4,Christian Caregiving a Way of Life,"This is an excellent book that we have used to teach Christian Care Giving in three churches. It also serves as a text book for the Stephens Ministry basic course. The book is good on its own, but works best when its contents are discussed in a class seting."
5,Exquisite!,A gem! Truly a gem! Billy Bob is the most vivid lyricist to come along in a long time. He deftly tackles the haunting questions that torment us in the night. This is music you can sit back and inhale.
1,Billy Bob's CD'S make nice coasters,Buying a Billy Bob CD is rolling the dice as to if anything on it will be worth listening to more than once. Now I am using the last two CD's I just got for coasters.I wish someone had warned me.
5,Excelent,"Thats a great melodic metal album singed by the gods of melodic metal. Tobias Sammet, Andre Matos, Kai Hansen, Rob Rock, Timo Tolkki ,Oliver Hartmann, Sharon Del Alden ,Davis Defeis and michael kikse. Thats a great album! buts its NOT POWER METAL! ITS MELODIC!Thats awesome!"
4,Iron Madien,"I purchased this CD for a friend (Dr. Berman) WOW it took me back to the age of Iron Madien( Hail Bruce),,Iron Madien will always be my Collectors Heavy Metal CD/Vinlyn. I will quote a statement from Bruce From one of his interviews...Iron Madien could have set the standards for other bands to follow..Tobais have done Bruce a lot of Justice in this Album..I like the Malfeus Malfecurium(witche's Bible)...track ..just great Tobais ,,sorry i would not keep u in my collection,,,,as i like the Hard Core Stufffffffffffff........393"
1,Really bad,I was looking for wasabi to use with home made sushi. I tried this and was totally disappointed. It is nothing like wasabi; it is the anti-wasabi. I don't know how they get away with calling it wasabi. I threw it away (almost a full tube).
3,Nabari No Ou,"Nabari No Ou series seemed at first random, but if you read that graphic novel first it would be that random. It seemed to rush at first. Then the plot did start to work out after a while. But the part one did seem to stop just where it was start getting good.I would say you should watch this just for something to watch, not something that you're looking for something that you may want to watch over and over, just something to watch if there is nothing else to see, and still be entertained. Because it did have some funny moments."
4,"Really, really like these!","I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked these little headphones. They were even better than I expected.The earbud wires goes straight into a lanyard that goes around your neck and then re-emerges at the bottom next to a string to hold your MP3 player. This was absolutely perfect for my device. It's excellent for working our because normally the wire for headphones were always getting snagged on treadmills or my hands which would yank the earbuds out of mt ears. Not with these! Since the wire goes into the lanyard, the wires comming out of the earbuds go behind your neck and the lanyard protects the wire from damage (which is the main reason I end up buying new earbuds).The sound quality is very good for earbuds. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that the buds themselves are a little big to fit comfortably in my ear.I definately recommend these to anyone, especially if you're like me and have a tendency to snag the wires."
1,Misleading Quality,"The book was supposed to be ""like new"" but it is, at most, ""very good"". It has a lot of signs of use. Dissapointed."
4,What a Grand Description of People and their Motivations,"This book differs greatly from her better known Little Birds and Delta of Venus. The characters Are The Story. It is rich in description, and the quirks and strivings of each persona is so minutely described, that it rings true these many decades later. I am sure a person in the book will remind you of someone you know."
3,"Good story, but not one I would read again.","I liked the plot of the book, but I it was confusing sometimes."
5,Great introductory text!,"Theodore H. Cohn's ""Global Political Economy: Theory and Practice"" is an excellent primer to the study of international political economy (IPE). This text covers the main theoretical approaches to IPE and provides fairly detailed accounts of several issues such as ""International Monetary Relations"", debt, trade, regionalism, MNC's, international development and a brief section on globalization. I used this book for an undergrad. IPE course about a year ago and I find myself constantly referring back to it, mostly for an overview of a subject. The most valuable component of this book is the reference section at the end of each chapter. Cohn has excellent sources that are invaluable for those who wish to pursue a certain theoretical perspective as well as a specific issue. These citations were particularly helpful when writing research papers. Overall, this is an outstanding beginners text in the subject of IPE."
2,Art Lund- not his best numbers.,"Art Lund was one of our favorite singers, but we felt this CD included his lesser known songs. We were disappointed."
3,they do their function.,"Work great for school. Cheap so I can loose them and not have to worry. I have had better one's with the grip of course, but these work just as well. They also come with lead in each pencil."
3,Nurturing,A delightful and useful addition for anyone interested in getting in touch with spiritual self.I get a bit mixed up with seasons etc being in the southern hemishere!
3,Twist in the Tail,"The Veteran is a new collection of short stories by thriller writer Frederick Forsyth. Like his earlier collection No Comebacks, the stories are all one shot wonders that depend for their effect on the sting in the tail that cast a whole new light retrospectively over the events leading up to the denouement. They are beautifully written, but you can only read them once. When the shock ending is known, the element of surprise is missing and the stories become rather tedious. So borrow this one from the library; don't buy it."
1,I expected better,"The first two stories weren't bad, but the fourth was little but an excrutiating amount of minutia with a very thin plot thrown in, and the fifth story, the novella, started with the premise that a human could hibernate for over 100 years and just got more ludicrous from there. I'd be willing to suspend disbelief a little, but very little else about the story was believable, either--the characters, their motivations, ect. I'd recommend that others not waste their time on this book."
4,"Physiology, biology and culture stirred together","A well-organized and thoughtfully researched commentary on the dynamics and implications of sexual appetites and behavior in the contemporary Western world. Kudos for its exposition of the mechanics of insemination and fertilization. With Jared Diamond's ""Why is Sex Fun"" and Matt Ridley's ""Red Queen"", a refreshingly candid discussion of matters the 19th century managed to push below the radar of trans-Atlantic polite society."
3,Didn't Like it Much,"It's great that Scott Miller came back into music, he has true gifts. I found the songs on here a bit pedestrian, though. It works in places : the keyboard-driven ""Aerodylinia"" and ""Jimmy Still Comes Around"" are my favorites. Many people like this record; I recomend later band efforts though."
1,The worst MS certification book I've ever read,"This is the worst Microsoft certification (not by Microsoft, but about Microsoft certifications) book I've ever read. It's filled with typos, incorrect answers, and just plain wrong information. For example, in explaining the rules for creating indexed views, ""sp_dboption 'ANSI_NULLS', true"" will not work. That's the incorrect syntax. The DB name must be included. Another problem I found that was extremely time-waisting are in answers which were calculation-based. For example, in the author's attempt to answer correctly regarding several questions about calculating the hard drive space and DB size requirements, he fails by providing wrong answers or answers based on different calculations not specified in the book. I find these types of errors in every single chapter!Ultimately, I decided to trash this book and buy another one. I should've checked the ratings before buying this. That teaches me to think before buying."
3,Light on the subject,"I have been using this book to improve my knowledge on SQL Server 2005 but I found this book to be very light on the subject. I am using a second book (microsoft version) as supplement and this one is published by Solid Quality LearningOverall, this book can be used as starting point"
3,Great product,"Great product, very stylish. Only flaw is as with any steering wheel cover, it is a pain to get on."
4,great price,I bought these because the price was great. I have not found any at this price since!!! They work great for the price I bought them for. My students have not complained.
2,Too many errors/typos; very sloppy in proofreading,"This book covers the subject matter well, but contains too many errors. One can tell it was put into publication in a hurry without careful proofreading. Maybe the same thing can be said of tech books on the market in general these days. I own many Addison-Wesley books, but have to say this one is of a lower quality in comparison. Just the first 20 pages or so contain no less than half a dozen obvious errors - makes one wonder how trustworthy the rest of the book is."
3,it's good,"as others pointed out this is not hight literature you'll be reading,it probably even has mistakes ,leaving that aside so far I am enjoying myself,I feared it would simply be reading those 2 eps this is based on in novel format,it is exactly that but it has it's differences in script and we learn more background than i the anie so if you liked thar part of the tv series you'll be fine too,now if you didn't bettter to stay away from this because who would enjoy an extended version of something they don't lke?so 3 stars from me,and I'll probably buying the second volume soon."
5,Sailor Moon#7 as the go on they get better!,"The Sailor moon #7 book is asome it ends the sailor moon R porsion of the comic books and begins the sailor moon S porsion. In the Salior moon s porsion Haruka, Michiru, And Hutaru Show up( sailor Uranes, Neptune, And saturn 3 of the 4 outer scouts, pLuto all ready showed up) Yepee!!! If I were you I would save up my money for it, i did and it is worth every penny! Even though this is a wonderful book i would suggest that you read the frist 6 before this one even though its posiable for you to understand it any way. The comic book is in black and white but the pictures are great any ways! Naoko Takeuchi and co. really out did them selfs out this time and I realy do reacomend this book it's realy worth 10 stas but i guess I will have to settel With 5."
2,Good info but poorly written.,"I am taking a Master's class in Telecom that is using this book. There is a lot of good information in this book. But it is a tough read. The biggest problem is the author's writing style. I wish he would have taken a tech writing class. If he had, he would have learned that simpler is better. The material is complicated enough. Write the way you speak.Page 13 for example. ""In general tems the equipment assoicated with any particular switching machine can be categorized as providing one of the following functions.. (lists the three functions of a switch)""What he is trying to say is: ""A switch performs 3 basic functions..."""
3,Bought for explorer... Don't expect much.,"I bought this to put in a custom ford explorer I sold. The two mats were slightly different shades of black, and they slide around all the time, they didn't match the racing seats either, the tints of blue, white, black where slightly different than the seat covers. I expected the finished vehicle to look really nice, instead it just looked cheesy."
3,One disappointment.....,"I know that when ordering any product, you do not get to choose colors. However, this Sparklz didn't have any colored handle, but naked silver."
1,Be sure of what you have...,"I'm really really upset at this purchase. The unit itself is fine, I like the design, weight and feel. BUT not with all Kensington tips. I have a Dell laptop that uses an N19 tip. Guess what? It doesn't fit. There is an extra grove in that tip that prevents it from attaching properly.Kensington should notify customers about this.I followed up with Kensington directly. Their response is, ""Thank you for contacting Kensington Technical Support. I understand your concern.I am sorry for the inconvenience caused. However, we will forward your case to our porduct Design Team. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused.In the meantime, I've trashed the packinging and ditched the receipt, can't even send it back to Amazon... Wait, I know, I'll buy a new laptop with a power supply that fits! :/"
2,"La Traviata: Renata Scotto & Jose Carreras,1973 VAI",Renata Scotto and Jose Carreras presented thier usual great preformance.I could tolerate the poor picture quality given the picture was recorded using 1973 technolgy.The Japanese subtitles constantly on screen was very annoying.I will use this production for listening only.SHAME ON VAI for this release.
2,I don't get it,"I don't really understand spending good money for a sort -f-interesting thing that you play with once. Stocking stuffer desperation, I guess. Still, kind of nifty."
5,good reference,The Harvard Medical School professor explains all the new methods of treatment. This book is more helpful than some General Practioners advice. Gives good advice on the SSRI's.
2,Not very useful,One glaring omission is that he fails to mention that SSRIs can cause permanent sexual side effects even after discontinuance. Long overlooked by the medical community. Do google search for details.
4,excelente guia para nivel medio- avanzado,"los Meyer ya saben como darnos la informacion, afortunadamente son libros muy faciles de leer aun si tu nivel de ingles es limitado.Este libro en especial tiene una serie de ejercicios que refuerzan lo basico y nos expican lo avanzado.Si ya has comprado libros de ellos, puede que te parezcan repetitivos, pero no te dejes llevar por eso. hay ajustes pequeños que te hacen ver diferente el proceso.Adobe After effects es un programa en crecimiento, por ello, no subestimes en la informacion de estos libros."
3,"Be Warned, this book is for version 5.5","This book only to find out it's for version 5.5... Not a cheap book, as I already have purchased it."
3,Hi!,"This book's been adapted for TV at least a half dozen times (the most famous probably being the Rockford Files version). A man and his wife return home after a party. She goes in the house first and husband follows moments later to find her missing. He's, of course, suspected of killing her and dumping her body on the way home. Tension mounts as he frantically tries to both find her and discover what's happened to her. Good book, although I disliked the advertising man lead. Seems to be both arrogant and obnoxious. Might just be me though. Good book."
2,Changed my view of Hemingway,"I was excited to find this at the library as I have always heard Hemingway was a cat lover. Apparently his view of love was a lot diiferent than mine. I was very upset that his ignorance in cat care despite the fact that he often referred to a book on cat care. Most were never altered which is why there were so many. There were several sad stories of cats being found dead.I also found it disturbing that when he died, he made no provisions for his cats in Cuba. His last wife went to Cuba to settle his estate and justy left the cats to fend for themselves. I would have been happier thinking of him as a cat lover than reading this book and now thinking of him as an idiot."
3,Hemingway's cats,This book was very interesting...written well. It also had some great pictures of Hemingway's cats and also a few pictures of him with his beloved cats. I learned a bit more about Hemingway after reading this book.
1,"I'm sorry, this album is stupid","I consider myself a Christ follower, this kind of music however just doesn't seem God inspired to me. I feel its more centered around feelings and the pop market than anything else. I was suckered into buying this cd from the other Amazon reviews and I want my money back. I do like track 7, except that it isn't an original song. Just because you are singing about God doesn't mean you should put it on a CD and sell it. God created those with talent and those without. Sonic flood = without."
5,Deyo & company deliver a rock worship classic!,"Released in 1999, Sonicflood's self-titled, self-produced album provides a masterful blend of rock, pop and even alternative with praise & worship lyrics added to create an outstanding rock worship project. The CD opens with a prayer by lead vocalist Jeff Deyo, who invites the listener to join the band in worshipping God. Some outstanding songs include the Deyo original ""Holy One,"" a cover of Bill Gaither's classic ""There's Something About That Name,"" Paul Baloche's ""Open the Eyes of My Heart"" and a rendition of Delirious' ""I Could Sing of Your Love Forever."" My overall favorite here is the closing track, ""The Heart of Worship."" Jeff Deyo and company have delivered a great rock worship album, and a great addition to my Christian music library."
5,Wow!,"I borrowed this CD from my youth pastor and decided that I HAD to get it. This is an AWESOME album---great lyrics, great sound---this is one of the best albums I've heard in awhile. I'm surprised at how little publicity I've seen these guys get. They seem very focused on the message, and how the music sounds at the same time. Some of the violins reminded me of a rougher Jars of Clay, and some of the guitar chords had a sound a bit similar to Deliriou5? Great album. I recommend it highly."
4,Disk 2 makes up for disk 1,"I have to agree with earlier reviews who said that disk 2 is much better than disk 1. Disk 1 has its moments though- Norah Jones' cover of ""More Than This"" is a wonderful song to kick back to. Coldplay's song is a little dull. Beth Orton's ""Daybreaker"" is one of the best songs to be produced in a LONG time. Disk 2 is amazing though, full of interesting rythms that sound amazing while you're laying down in a dark room. Overall as a unit, it's an ample chill collection. Nothing too great about it, and definitely not as good as UC1."
4,Secrets of the secret word revealed!,"The progam You Bet Your Life was central to Groucho's career, and the events and issues surrounding that program are revealed in Robert Dwan's lucid account in a way that could not have been done by anyone else. Dwan does not just provide a behind-the-scenes look at YBYL, however; he places it insightfully in the context of the background, psychology, and career of Julius Marx, and also in the context of the times. Much of this book is very funny indeed, but it also provides sensitive and profoundly serious discussions of issues such as censorship, the McCarthy era, and racism. It's not just a welcome addition to the literature on Groucho. It is an essential, as well as delightful, contribution to the core of that literature. And it is full of fabulous photos, some of which are not available elsewhere."
4,Hamish at a Health Farm?,"This is one of the best examples of a cozy Christmas mystery that I've read for awhile. Hamish is at loose ends on Lochdubh. He can't go to his parents' house since there is going to be an aunt there who hates him. Priscilla is too busy with her father's hotel, so he accepts an invitation to go to lonely, remote Eileencraig for the holidays. One of Priscilla's acquaintances has asked him to come in an unofficial capacity to investigate whether or not there is someone trying to kill her. While he's there another resident at the health farm turns up dead, and Hamish finds himself in the middle of a murder again. The best thing about this book is a native islander called Geordie and his possessed truck. Beaton never fails to amuse and Hamish is as adorable as ever."
2,WONDERING,"I NEED TO BUY THIS BOOK ASAP, BUT BEFORE I BUY IT FROM YOU! CAN YOU TELL ME, IF IM GOING TO HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE ACCESS CODE IF I BUY THE USED BOOK?????"
1,HORRIBLE!,"I truly wish I hadn't wasted my money on this vacuum.First off, if you have pets -- take it back to the store. NOW. Don't unbox it or set it up. Just take it back.It will not pick up pet hair, and leaves ""streaks"" along carpeted areas. It won't pick up anything on hardwood flooring, and the only side that will get anything near a baseboard is the right side. The left side? I'm not sure ... it's like the brush isn't even reaching there.The collection container is hiddeously small. The vacuum clogs constantly. I'm not kidding. Constantly. Keep a phillips screwdriver with you at all times. And the smell? Hideous. I don't know why. I've checked everything, but this vacuum stinks.Please, PLEASE, don't waste your money on this. Spend a little more and get a good vacuum.Shame on you, Eureka!"
2,Hose is way too short.,"The vacuum seems to be fine, but the hose is very short and very, very hard to use. I would never buy this vacuum again."
1,NEVER AGAIN!!,I bought this vacuum as a replacement for my Kirby. I could not have made a bigger mistake in my purchase! The hose gets clogged FREQUENTLY and renders itself absolutely WORTHLESS. The canister fills up QUICKLY. The cord is a mess and does not fit anywhere. I am VERY disappointed in this Eureka. I consider this purchase of the Eureka Uno one of my worst purchases.
1,BIG Waste of Money,This is my first review online because I strongly believe this vacuum sucks! The roller brush always stops spinning because hair gets tangled around it. This occurs with each use. The suction/design should be better. I have to troubleshoot after each use in order to use it again. So frustrating.
2,Endless clogging,"I bought this vacuum when I used to live with a roommate with a dog. This vacuum got clogged at least once per cleaning of the apartment. The hose gets clogged most often. The plastic circular filter just above the dirt canister got clogged quite often too. Lastly, though not as often, the hose just above the rotating carpet cleaner on the bottom got clogged.I now live in a new apartment with a short carpet and no pet. The vacuum now only gets clogged half as often, however it still a pain.I use this vacuum only because I don't want to pay for another one. But it looks like i'll have no choice because today i noticed smoke originating below the dirt canister where I believe the motor is located."
5,Great introduction to Rosh Hashanah,"I bought this book for a class of Kindergarteners to teach them about Rosh Hashanah, and it was really fantastic. Most of the children were not Jewish and it covered all of the basics of the holiday, leading perfectly into more descriptions and activities after we'd finished. The repetition and basic concepts in the Sammy Spider books are fantastic for children following along--by the middle of the book everyone was saying along with the story, ""Silly Sammy...spiders spin webs!""I would recommend this book and the other Sammy Spider stories for preschoolers and Kindergarteners of all backgrounds. They're really fantastic.Just a note: the book uses simple vocabulary (challah, etc), so you may want to make sure you know how to pronounce some words that are used if you are not familiar with them."
5,proud uncle,"my nephew produced this movie,daniel dunn and im so excited about it comming out cant wait to see it wish i could get it before may,proud of ya daniel,uncle roy"
2,Madison County,"I was really hyped up for this movie. The hype I was anticipating was quickly changed to disappointment. Above all, the most disappointing thing was the ending. It just kinda ended leaving questions. Maybe room for a sequel; gosh I hope not. I wish I had NOT spent the cost to buy it new. I resold it to a buy back place and was totally ripped off. Should have given it to Goodwill. The character on the front of the DVD is of course the menace in the movie and there is an explanation of who he is but the movie is a let down. I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU BUY IT if you have to spend more than $5."
5,great movie!,"First off I would definitely ignore any negative reviews on this film, I ordered Madison County with my girlfriend on RedBox, and then bought it on Amazon the next day. Nick Principe (Chromeskull) did a great job as Damien Ewell, just like Laid to Rest I finished watching Madison County wanting more! Good acting, good story, great ending, I definitely recommend this movie to any horror fans out there, you will definitely not be disappointed! Great job guys, hope to see a Madison County 2 in the near future!"
4,D of A W K,Okay movie but wouldn't buy it! It was too predicable! and if shifted back and forth too much. His friend makes the movie.
4,Awesome Family Fun!!!,"This movie was actually a lot better than I expected, and had some hilarious moments. I can relate to some of the things that happened to Greg. I have not read the book, so I couldn't compare it. 12 year old Greg Heffley is nervous about starting middle school. Him and his dorky best friend, Rowley Jefferson try to fit in and become popular, but that's easier said than done. Throughout the school year, Greg and Rowley come up with weird ways to become popular like being a Safety Patrol officer, wrestling, and performing in epic school plays. In order to truly appreciate this film, you either need to be a parent, or think from the perspective of a kid. I highly recommend DIARY OF A WIMPY KID!!!"
3,Saw it once and then ...,"Kid liked it, saw it once and then it was not memorable.We saw it together but too childish for me, prefer the books."
3,Good kid movie,"This is a good kid movie, especially that school-age crowd. Teaches you to be yourself and stick up for your friends."
4,Wimpy Kid on Screen.,"You will recognize many of the themes from the book series in the movie (the Cheese Touch, Greg taking on the role of a tree in the school play, Greg attempting to have a sleepover with Fregley). It doesn't translate as well on screen but there are some very funny parts, most of them provided by older brother Roderick or best friend Rowley. In both parts the actors are standouts and clearly relish their roles. There was a bit more grossout scenes than I expected, in particular a scene with Greg relieving himself that I could have lived without. The movie feels somewhat muted compared to the book but is worth seeing for some humerous bits and good performances. Overall the movie is quite appropriate for the whole family, with the minor caution about the odd tasteless scene."
