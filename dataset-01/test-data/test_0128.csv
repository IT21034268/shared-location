1,Base is cracked upon receipt,"Well...ONE star. I bought this model based on reviews on various woodworking forums and for the above table adjusting feature. While waiting for this to arrive I built my own router table for this model. As mentioned by a previous buyer, the spindle lock was cracked, except mine came that way. So I cant really rate the performance. Not sure at this time If I will go with a replacement unit or just return the whole thing and get something else. I really wanted the above table feature but the finish on this really leaves a lot to be desired. I will update with performance if I get a replacement."
1,Nothing but trouble,"Have had my 895 just over a year and it's now in the trash. It has spent more time in the truck (back and forth to the service center) than my wife has been in the truck.First time I used it the screw on the height adjustment fell out and I had to pry the motor out of the base. Took it to the service center and they gave me a hard time about the screw that I replaced it with and voided the warranty ... 7 days after I bought it!Had to replace the variable speed control 6 months later. Last night it started spitting flames and smoke while I was cutting a raised panel.Porter Cable calls this ""heavy duty"" but don't believe it."
1,variable speed problems,"I purchased this on clearance at Menards and used it for a few minor projects before having problems with the motor and variable speed control. The motor would either rev or the higher speeds would 'lock in' and not allow for adjustment to a lower speed. Obviously these are major safety issues so I returned it for a full refund and purchased Bosch's similar fixed/plunge base model. So far so good with the Bosch.Do your research before purchasing this router, or any power tool for that matter."
5,Killer router! (killer meaning good.),"This is my first (and hopefully my last router.) Knew I wanted to do cabinet work and also knew that the router is the cornerstone of finish woodwork. My best investment to select the right router & know how to use it was a DVD called 'The Versatile Router'. The teacher was partial to Bosch, but rated the Porter Cables strong too.You'll find PC's 890 series are so new that they don't rate alot of their accessories for it. Still if you get guidance from an expert, you can find what you need. I made a planing fence for my router table from the DVD's guidance. Very cool for planing wood surfaces flat rather than buying a planer!Read the manual, take the 'feeding slowly' guidance to heart. You'll get more life out of your bits (and Lord knows those bits are expensive!)"
3,Good for the price,"Nicer birdbaths that I'd seen at birding stores were about twice the price of this. The birdbath is great, but the stand is pretty flimsy and it puts the bath it too low to the ground. I used the hanging chain instead which was fine, but I did have to buy a pole to hang it from. The birds like it and I'm happy with it."
4,Head gardener/master gardener intern (agrilife texas),"I bought this item for a bird feeder not a bird bathe! I think for me it might be a bit shallow for bathe, but it is a solis unit. I use it with the standing feature pole and i get squirrels eating, standing and hanging from it, so if hold them it can hold a bird just fine. I love the glazed blue look and it blends into my landscape wonderfully! it would work for a bathe, so don't get wrong! I love it!"
4,BEAUTIFUL BATH / BAD STANDING/ APPARATUS/ INADEQUATE INSTRUCTIONS,"The birdbath itself is even more beautiful than shown on the web site. However, the metal standing apparatus is not that stable and there is only a soft plastic piece for the bottom,i.e., no solid sharp part to go into the ground. We had to use our own ingenuity to get the metal stakes in the ground and at least relatively stable.I think there should have been information about the standing stakes on the web site and information in the instructions about how to adequately put standing stakes in the ground.Purchased at Amazon.com"
1,unable to review since order was incomplete,"I received the birdbath but the shipment was incomplete. The hardware for the stand and hanging was not included. So, I couldn't use the birdbath either way and decided to return it for a full refund."
1,Not worth it,"I bought this for my mother thinking it would be light for her to be able to lift/clean vs. the traditional heavy concrete baths. I was embarrassed by the supporting base that wouldn't hold the bowl. The base is three separate flimsy hollow tubes. When you set the bowl onto them they spread and the bowl falls to the ground. Maybe additional parts needed weren't included.... Regardless, the base was too flimsy and not shaped correctly to hold the bowl well anyway. I would have returned it if my mother had not discarded the box."
2,It was ok,"I thought the hero was overly dense. At first it seemed like he would wake up, but it didn't happen for the longest time. I like the hero to be a little smarter."
5,wonderous,"frankly I think that susan wiggs horsemasters daughter was absalutaly amazing I hadnt even known that the book was lying on my shelf for 5 years and as soon as I read 1 page I was inseperatible from it and when I was finished I let all my friends read it and asked them what they rated it my first friend said said definatly 5 stars my secound friend read 2 chapters and I asked her ""what do you rate this book so far?""she said its 4 stars but heck im only 2 chapters in it im pretty sure it will be 5 stars by the time im finished it because every page gets better!All in all i would recamend it to anyone even a guy!"
1,Too much loss,"I bought this item to connect a computer and LCD TV. I never got it never quite working right, and I assumed that it was a glitch in my video card settings. I have since learned that the static and ""black area"" corruption I was seening are the signs of exessive signal loss. Since the ""Monster"" version of this cable is over $90.00 I guess this is another case of getting what you pay for. It's not defective in that it works, but the quality of the signal makes the picture unwatchable at HD resolutions. It does work fine at VGA resolutions, but the picture quality is too low.Looks like a monster cable is in my future."
2,This one could use a good editor,"This book has potential, but the unforgivable typos and unwieldy exercises make it a poor resource. Put this one on your pass-it-by list. It's unfortunate that ""the Visio senior technical evangelist"" has been party to such a poorly edited book."
2,Not sure about this one,"I started taking these and my skin started breaking out. I'm not sure if this was the cause, so I have stopped for a little while. I do plan on taking them for no other reason than they were expensive and I dont want to waste my money. What I did notice is that when using the bleaching cream to try to remove the brown spots caused from the breakouts, I didnt get the normal light spot in those areas. The brown spots are going away but the surrounding skin is staying relatively even toned; that's new and I like that. If I take them and I dont break out again, I will probably buy them again but reduce the daily dosage to make my money stretch out a little bit."
3,Skin Lightening,It's still too early to tell.....It's only been less than a month. So far I haven't seen any start of results....it's too early to make a fair evaluation.....Later I can give a more fair testimony about the product.
3,It didn't work for me,I didn't notice any difference in my complexion while using this product. It was just a total waste of money .
1,waste of money,This product did nothing to me. My skin was still the same color and my wallet is thinner. No points of buying this product unless you would like to waste money.
4,"Great look, cool construction, but my 2 1/2 year old broke it","I was SO impressed with this toy when I opened the box. It looks wonderful. I love how the forklift operates. However, my two and a half year old son broke the forklift part off. I don't know how rough that he was being with the toy. He was with my husband when it happened. It cannot be simply glued back together. I am disappointed that it can't be used how it's supposed to anymore. :-("
5,must have tool,if you are doing ANY type of trim or walls or any remodels. this is a must have tool for acurate ftiing of angles. ANY house no matter how new you will find the walls NOT straight! i even bought one of these for my FIL and we used it setting tile!!
4,Good Tool - Wish They'd Had The Smaller One When I Bought This One,"Overall, I like this tool a lot. It's solid, easy to use, and my label seems to be on straight because this tool is accurate. My only problem is that there are so many places I can't use it because of it's length. I bought mine in 2004, before they came out with a shorter version. If you know you'll be OK with the size, I think this is a good tool for the price."
2,Starrett 505A-12 ProSite Protractor,"Not accurate. 45 and 90 degrees do not match up one way, but do the other. I have no confidence in the accuracy of this item. Wish I had never bought it. The concept is good but not followed through on this item."
1,Starrett should be ashamed,"I ordered this thinking it was to good to be true...and found out it was. Starrett should be ashamed to put this product out. Any good woodworker is not going to put up with a tool that is +/- a degree. When I need accuracy I have always trusted Starrett, after this piece of junk I now question their integrity. Total garbage that will be returned."
2,"Not calibrated, not accurate","I agree with one of the reviewers above. This unit is not accurate. I have been through two, and have checked two more from guys on my crew. The dial is off by anywhere between 1/2 to 1 degree on all 4 (with their own calibration marks!). It is a nice solid tool, and priced well, but if you need a dead on accurate reading keep looking. I switched to the bosch."
4,Useful tool.,"Kind of pricey though. I'd personnaly like a smaller unit that would fit easily in a tool back. This one is twice as wide, and 6 inches longer than it needs to be."
4,"Very nice, but very small. Here's an alternative.","[...], I found this plane to be just dandy for occasional surface planing, but a bit small for my big mitts.For comparison, I have also used the similar, but larger, Veritas Razor Blade Block Plane # 19P1600 ($21). It is a little bigger (2""W x 5""L x 2""H) than the Stanley (1""W x 3.25""L x 1""H), uses replaceable Rc60 razor blades ($2/pkg.), and, with three different blade positions, is a bit more versatile. Personally, I prefer the larger size & versatility of the Veritas model, but it is not as easy to tuck in your pocket as the Stanley.FYI the razor blade in the Veritas plane can be installed in one of three different positions: (1) at mid-body for surface planing, like the Stanley; (2) at the toe for flush trimming or for use as a knife; and (3) at the heel for smoothing/scraping concave surfaces in thin material.Unfortunately the Razor Blade Plane isn't available at Amazon, but can be seen at Lee Valley Veritas:[...]"
4,Still amusing and inspiring!,"As a leftist, inspiring pieces of literature are not exactly few and far between - but ones this entertaining certainly are. In Odets' work, there is nary a word out of place, and every social comment he has to make is thoughtfully expressed in a gentle fashion unknown to many playwrights.Awake and Sing! is in particular a piece of art. Odets makes the ideals of social protest easily accessible in dramatic form, and the end result is an educational and thought-provoking read that still manages to be amazing fun."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this toothbrush several years ago as my first electric. I was fairly satistified with it, but my minor dental problems were not getting much better. About six months ago this toothbrush finally failed and I decided to try a Sonicare Elite - 5 times more expensive. Wow! What a difference. I just got back from the dentist and, in every measurable way, the Sonicare did a better job. This ain't a bad toothbrush, but it's not substantially better than a manual jobber. You only have one mouthful of teeth, don't be cheap with them."
5,Nice Tool,Nice tool for cutting sheet metal. I have had this for over 2 years with no problems. One minor issue is the blade is completely hidden from view requiring you to rely soley on the index marks while cutting along a line.
5,A peak into mental illness,"A Quiet Storm is a vividly, riveting tale of how one family handles the issue of mental illness. I enjoyed the book and the way the author accurately portrayed the symptoms and life struggles of a woman with a mental illness. The book makes you laugh and cry. The book does an excellent job of portraying a family trying to maintain the status quo in the midst of a swirl of family secrets and betrayal. The relationship between the two sisters is masterfully written. As a mental health professional I have listened to the story of many clients who struggle with these issues as they try to make it from day to day.The book is spellbinding. A great book for book clubs.The author has a real gift for painting a word picture.Though the book is fiction, the story could be one we hear of unfortunately in real life. This book is a must read."
2,good basic information. learned some.,"I give this a B grade. It's OK, but mostly just a guy talking and not a lot of hard core information. Great for beginners as a starter."
4,Works as it should,Nothing out of the ordinary with this but it gets 4 stars as the blade can be a somewhat tedious to get straight. Nit the end of the world and once it's in place there are no issues. Worked as is should and used it to make my stone a wood sword. That was rewarding.
3,Nice plane after you have taken the time to tune it,It took about 1 hour to make the bottom of the plane perfectly flat. Out of the box the base of the plane showed serious machine marks and required about an hour to make the bottom perfectly flat using progressive sandpaper from 80 grit to 320 grit. Then the iron had to be sharpened and beveled to the correct 25 degree angle. Once that is done the plane works very well.
3,Bad Blood,"I like the 24 Series, however, Janeane Garofalo just ruins it for me. Her acting is just not enough to distract me from my disgust of her past comments. Actors need to realize that what they say and do does reflect on their performance. Many do it as instructed by their managers to stay in the public view by any means, but they need to temper their comments and actions so as not to alienate a large segment of the demographic that they hope to entertain.Freedom of Speech was never intended to allow citizens to say untrue, hurtful or unpopular commentary. The founders intended to guarantee our right to challenge with impunity the government not each other."
5,This is GOOD music!,"This is an awesome album for people that like good music. Beth has the strongest and most passionate voice ever! This album is so powerful and energetic that it makes you want to scream, dance, make out, and eat fried chicken all at the same time! You should totally buy this album! DO IT NOW!!!"
2,How to Write Knockout Proposals,"I must have been knocked out when I read this book, because I didn't learn anything amazing or new beyond basic Grantwriting 101. I was hoping for some actual examples that illustrated a knockout paragraph or intro or letter. the information was very ""standard"" to what one needs to know, but nothing that was over the top."
4,"Uneven, but still great.","It's an uneven album, self-indulgent at times, but the last song makes up for any defects. 'On' is one of the greatest post-Beatles pop songs yet."
1,Theology for Disciples,Have not received it yet....still waiting!!! Should have been here by December 6th...it is now almost Christmas and It is still not here. Very disappointed!!
3,DOWN WITH THE TEXAN,"I'm gonna have to stick with the Canadian. Snapcase is the bomb, I have their other albums and they are great but this one is not even close to their more recent recording. If you want good Snapcase, don't get this one."
5,The perfect present,The perfect present for the enthusiast. This got me a lot of points. A perfect token from a different generation of McDonald's lovers
1,Replacement battery was worse than the original one,I got a replacement battery because the original one was only keeping about 50% of the charge it did when new. Then I discovered that the replacement battery performed worse than the original battery with it's 50% performance. Junk.
4,AFTER the one year warranty?????,"It's a 5+ star rating; however, there is one big HUGE question! What will it cost to repair/replace a Kindle 1 AFTER the warranty period? My Kindle has been replaced 4 times this past year.... easy, no cost and rapid service. Knowing that it has frozen up four times, I bet this latest Kindle 1 will freeze again. What will be MY cost to repair/replace KINDLE 1 next time?"
1,Bad Battery,I love my 1st generation Kindle but upon my second battery replacement it only lasted 30 days. I am now trying to decide whether to send it back for a replacement or just buy a Kindle competitor with better battery life. Poor quality Amazon!
3,Replacement Kindle Battery,I purchased a replacement battery for my Kindle. It works great. I only hope it will last longer than my orginal battery which only made it about 3 1/2 months.
3,Kindle 1 Battery,"My husband bought this for Christmas for me, and what a disappointment this battery is! I now have an expensive ""brick"" I can't read because of a shortage of batteries! Very discouraged about my Amazon purchase which is currently useless! I feel Amazon has let all of us down when we trusted them. Evidently, this is a more inferior battery than the Kindle 2, which has a longer lasting battery. Shame on you, Amazon. We will be more careful with any future purchases through Amazon!!!!"
1,wrong battery,I received the wrong battery. Silly me. But I can't find the right one!!! And now I have to figure out how to return it.
3,ASK QUESTIONS......REALLY!,"I'm not really certain how these batteries work. Amazon sent them to me by mistake. Oddly enough, after spending about 15 minutes online with an Amazon Rep looking at my account, the Rep determined that I needed a battery that I could install. I ordered two batteries for my Kindle. They came with NO INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS!!! NONE!!! NOT ONLINE, NOT IN THE BOX, NOWHERE WERE THERE ANY INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS!!! Upon calling Amazon, another Rep told me that I in fact could not replace the battery in my Kindle myself. It would need to be returned to Amazon to ""determine"" if I ""needed a new battery"". SO! Let's see, I got wrong info from the people in charge. I was sold something I don't need, can't use and must return. I also will be without a Kindle for God knows how long.My advice? BUY AN iPad!!! This Kindle BS is frustrating, archaic and leaves you empty-handed."
2,"Weak, doesn't last",I'm on my third battery for the Kindle despite no more than moderate use. Amazon needs to retool this thing; it doesn't last. Very frustrating.
1,Kindle battery,The NEW replacement battery is no better than the old one. I still have to recharge the Kindle nearly every day.
2,Replacement worked - but for how long?,"The original Kindle battery I had lasted at full capacity for maybe 3 months. By 6 months, it was completely unusable. What's more, the battery casing itself was bulging out so that the back of Kindle couldn't even fit... which made me worry about leaks and things inside the battery.This replacement battery made an instant difference, all of a sudden the Kindle lasts the proper amount of time on a charge. But I won't trust it to work for too long. Luckily these batteries are cheap."
1,Never in Stock!,"Being that this item is never in stock, I am giving Amazon a report card of one star ... this is a slap is the face of Kindle owners. I will have to find my replacement battery from another vendor ... and ""YES"" there are others that sell Kindle replacement batteries. You just have to Google search it. Try ""Batteryship dot com"" for a replacement.Batteryship has them in stock as of 3-5-09. They sound pretty good, and the price is the same. This is from their page :""Amazon Kindle D00111 BatteryBRAND NEW Amazon Kindle D00111 eBook Battery Replacement & Tools (battery condition: NEW) 3.7 volts 1530 mAh, Lithium PolymerBattery Capacity: 1530 mAhOur Price: $18.95Order two - get 10% off instantly!Availability: In Stock"
1,Unhappy waiting,Does anyone know how much longer it will take to get a replacement battery?It's not that I dislike my kindle; I love it! I don't even mind having to buy a battery within the first year of owning my Kindle. I really mind waiting for the battery to become available! I ordered a battery at the beginning of November '08 and no battery is available yet. No one has even hinted when it might become available.K. Carlton
1,Bad battery and no available replacement,"After 4 months of use, the battery in my Kindle no longer holds a charge. I can only use my Kindle now by using the AC adapter. That means I need to be 5 feet from an electrical outlet or start buying a bunch of extension cords. I've been trying since the beginning of Dec 2008 (it is now mid Feb 2009) to get a replacement battery but they have been on backorder with no signs of when they will be back in stock. I just heard about the Kindle2. Hopefully the new version uses a battery that is compatible with the Kindle1 (only better quality). If they use compatible batteries, maybe there will be more batteries on the market."
2,What the hell is this?,"A man morphs into metal...that is all I can comprehend.There are truly some interesting scenes in here and the first half hour feels like it was pulled straight out of my nightmares (some of my more stylish ones), but the rest of the movie really has no direction or at least with all the stop animation, I couldn't tell. It's a short film, only a little over an hour, but by the time it was over, I felt like I had just gotten through watching Gone With the Wind.For the gorehounds out there, there's very little gore in this movie (with the exception of one or 2 scenes), but there is much to compensate. For fans of dubbing: My friends and I were appalled at the lack of the dubbing option on the special edition (English subtitles only) until we discovered that there is very little dialogue."
5,A twisted masterpiece,After my initial viewing of this film I literally had to scrape myself off the walls. Tsukamoto has the most intense visual style you're likley to see. The story is as original as it is shocking. It's hypnotic pace and nightmarish techno score will rip into your head...and stay there. THIS IS A MUST SEE!
3,Disturbing,"This bizarre film is disturbing, troubling me that the main character is in an irriversible predicament. Wishing he could shed the metal that kept growing on his body, I found meaning in his painful transformation. Seeing that his pain never went away and that he desired to continue pushing the 'normal' world away left me without the typical 'happy ending.' There is meaning to the madness of this film, but there are several scenes that will stay with you after turning off the DVD player."
5,If you want to see some thing different......,This is one of my all time favorites. This is the film that inspires me to make films. I keep going back to it over and over each time I see somthing new. This film blows Eraser head out of the water.
3,"Great Films, slight disappointment",Good price for 3 decent Stephen King films. One catch: DREAMCATCHER is not in Widescreen so I will have to purchase a Widescreen version other than that I shall enjoy this set for years to come.CAP
3,Witty!,"I signed into Amazon so that I could buy a copy of this book for my friend who has moved out of the area - I was very surprised to see the prior review from Derby, NY - I laughed out loud when I saw her point out that there are more millionaires than trailer park people in Derby - last I remembered, this book was fiction, wasn't it? :) And she should probably read her own review before commenting on grammatical errors! I thought the book was good, particularly for native Western New Yorkers. And I am proud to have a book published by someone from my hometown and wish him well!"
1,Be prepared to be disappointed,"After reading the glowing reviews here, I went ahead and took a chance on this and was frankly disappointed. So much so that I trashed my copy. How you rate this unusual documentary is going to be highly subjective. Take my advice and rent it before committing to a purchase."
4,A great movie,I my self i like the movie.it was good from start to the in .good docmentary for any one to relate when they where young.and the kids are so funny. and the film says being strange can be fun when your young.
5,OFF THA CHAIN,"Hey yo, dis album iz off da heezy fo' sheezy. I bump dis shizzle in my Caddy 24-7 FA SHO...Yanni is on tour wit Dr.Dre, Ice Cube , Ludacris n' Snoop Dizzle(Snoop Dogg)and he got mad skill when he on tha mic....Yanni is tha greatest"
1,Forget Yanni,"I like to feel relaxed and comforted as much as the next woman. I had heard tell that Yanni was the pianist to create such an effect. Being a piano aficianto myself, I was curious. I gave the man and chance and he didn't beat Chopin. My advice, forget Yanni."
3,Interesting but a bit outdated already,"As the parent of a child who underwent fetal surgery for spina bifida (FS4SB), I was especially interested in this book. While it raises some very interesting, thought-provoking issues about medical ethics and ""fetal politics"", some of its musings are already outdated. It came out less than a year after Vanderbilt University began its remarkably successful program in FS4SB, which has greatly improved the potential quality of life for more than 150 children in the past several years. It's unfortunate that the real, unmistakable medical benefits of this kind of surgery can be overshadowed by the monolith of politics. The social anatomy of fetal surgery has changed radically since this book came out; perhaps it's time for a more insightful, well-balanced update."
2,Great Fit - Zero Durability,"Tried on a variety of breeches in a variety of fabrics and LOVED the fit and feel of these. Soft, flexible, stays in place. Sadly, three washings later the seam below the faux fly developed holes around the stitching; the fabric is essentially falling apart along the seam. My sister bought a pair at the same time and is experiencing problems in the same place, but in her case the stitching also fell apart in places and the edges of the fabric separated. Very disappointed!!"
2,Cookbook,I am Ok with the purchase but it turns out not to be what I thought it was...My wife and I had recieved a New Betty Crocker cookbook when we were first married and it contained notebook rings to allow you to add receipes. I though I was ordering another one like ours but this turned out to be a hardback; but it contains all the original receipes.
5,Cooking just like grandma did,I actually bought this book for my mother because her original one was lost. She absolutely loves this book which was published in 1956. It has all the great cooking recipes like grandma did and man I love eating these recipes lol. The book came in excellent condition and has been used every week since she got it. I rated it a 10+
5,Great prog mix.,"I like all types of trance and tend to lean more toward epic trance. However I am really enjoying what some trance has evolved to lately. I still love the more epic/big room/symphonic type trance. But I am loving this earthy progressive blend just as much. One note for Coldharbour Sessions fans. He made this with a club type atmosphere in mind, where as on his Sessions it is a radio show for people to listen to and relax to at home. Big difference, but either way, this is the deeper prog stuff that he's known for live, and it is definitely an essential CD to own."
4,"Great Quality, Low on extras","Great sound quality for such small speakers, excellent picture quality, player also plays DVDs quietly.Five disc DVD player a plus. There are however a few annoyances:1. Display on the unit could be a little bit bigger.2. No extra inputs, outputs beyond the minimum.3. It would be nice if the remote had a backlight.Despite a few annoyances, you get a lot for your money."
2,Blew the subwoofer,"I've had this particular system for a couple of years now and when recently playing ""The Blueprint"" - the subwoofer blew a circuit. Granted I was playing it fairly loud and had the sub set on a high level, but hell isn't that what a 'banging' system is for?And since the connection between the receiver and sub is an S-Video connection, I can't just readily replace the sub. So here I am stuck with trying to find the same sub for who knows how much or starting from scratch.Total bummer. This system is apparently manufactured for Sinatra and Glen Campbell listeners. Rock 'n Roll, rap, punk listeners need seek a solution elsewhere."
3,MISREPRESENTED,"I purchased this CD because I am an avid collector of original Jamaican ska. I simply love this musical genre. This particular collection is not all ska. Several of the tracks are calypsos. There is some good vintage ska here, but the people who put this together shouldn't have marketed it as a ska compilation because it is not. It should be re-titled to better reflect what it is. Ska is ska. Calypsos are calypsos. Calypsos and ska tunes DO NOT sound good together. I was disappointed in this CD. I'm the Big Oh and I say don't say it's ska when it's part calypso. I gotta go."
5,very happy,when i look at this and read all the inputs it sound like a nightmare but it was very easy to set up and it came not damageso i was very please with my product. It look very nice and i am very please on how well it made .
5,Wayne's World Wayne's World Party time Excellent,This is truly the greatest movie ever. Great characters and Mike and Dana are at their funniest. My friends and I have memorized the whole movie and we recite lines to each other every day. It cracks us up.Buy this movie
2,Where in the WWW is Daniel Gray,"Couldn't find the author of this book to ask him to explain this ripoff and waste of time. The initial browse was tempting, especially the tutorials and online updates. But the files required for some tutorials are not on the disc. The online update information is outdated-wrong because vmedia.com is not available. None of this inspires a further investment of time. I would rather invest a little more money in another book that fulfills promises which were crucial in the decision-to-purchase. Who is responsible for this deception?"
2,HIGHLY FRUSTRATING,"I have read several good software instructional books, and I found Ventana's ""Ultimate Guide"" to Pagemill to be ULTIMATELY FRUSTRATING. The author tends to mention a particular attribute of the program without telling you how to access it until the very end of his discussion. A good example of this problem can be found in his explanation of HTML ""anchors."" He tells us how to create a single anchor and how to name it, but once we've done that, he doesn't tell us of what use they are or how to move between one anchor and the next--the entire reason these objects exist. I find myself continually marking up my copy with questions that I hope are answered later in the book. Some are, others aren't. This book could be very useful in another, more carefully edited edition. (I've also found quite a few typos which suggests the haste of the publication process.) In short, stay away from the 1997 edition and be wary of this series of ""Ultimate Guides."""
3,more like 2 and a half stars,"veronica quite honestly is just an ok singer.in other words she only sounds good on upbeat latin/R&B.she; really doesn't have vocal range.in some songs she sounds horribly out of tune like on track #4. No One But You -feat Craig Mack just awful!.all in all this album is just average,not bad but not outstanding either.rise is probably the best track on here closely followed by some 1 2 hold.i do however wish her well on finding a stable record label as she has gotten screwed around by mercury records when she released v...for veronica (wich i havent had the pleasure of hearing cause its hard to find)."
4,"Very good, with higher hopes for the next edition","I'm sad that I can't give this book 5 stars because the quality is there. I would have liked additional examples of programming for Unicode. Java is easy because Unicode is its native character set. But I work in C++, C, SQL, Perl and shell scripts too. A few pages dedicated to each of these (and perhaps some other languages in common use) would be of great help. Some of the issues I'd like to see addressed are:1) The preferred data type(s) for representing Unicode characters in each language.2) Library functions to avoid and alternatives to each.3) Reading and writing common encodings (UTF-8 and UCS-16 are the big ones).4) Conversion between Unicode and other character sets.The addition of this material in future edition would make this one of the most essential books on the shelf of anyone developing software for the international market. As it stands, it is still a fine book. If you are a programmer doing internationalization, it is worth owning."
2,Get Unicode Demystified instead,"This book is not really current, nor is it particularly well written. Unicode Demystified is bigger and more expensive, but it's more up to date, very well written and is an amazingly easy read."
5,Best CD I've Boughten in a LONG time!!,"I love to dance and this song is the same one from the video, so how could I NOT get this CD??!! The video's got the hottest guys and dance moves and the song ROCKS! The song from her self-titled CD isn't the same as this one. This version's more of a dance mix. And best of all, the spanish version is included too!!"
5,great dance song,"Christina Aguilera's ""Come On Over Baby(All I Want Is You)"" is a cool song. It's way better than the original one on her album. It has a better beat than the other one and it's just a hipper song. This is one of my favorite Christina Aguilera songs."
5,Very Good Movie,"I loved this movie. It is very good. I recommend for everyone to see this movie, you'll like it."
3,OK,"This book is OK. There are any more out there that focus on the spiritual aspects of fasting. Hagin was a great faith teacher. Apparently, fasting was not his forte. Stick to his books on faith."
2,Disappointed,Even when assembled per the instructions the doors do not open and close easily. I had to file them down in order to make the cabinet functional. Many others have had similar complaint. You get what you pay for.
3,Rubbermaid 7085 Base Cabinet,"set-up was a chore, but I like the way it looks and the capacity. The doors seem to operate nicely without draging or hard operation."
2,not the best quality control,the base cabinet had some deformed side walls that didn't align and make a good seal. they had a angle and should have been flat
2,"overpriced, overlaid instructions, left the plugs in the doors.","1. This product is hugely overpriced.2. The cutouts in the holes were so chincy, the plastic cracked when I inserted the poles. They left the plug cutouts in the doors so they would rattle around inside.3. The top lid didn't size up to the holes. I had to bend the plastic to make it fit.4. The assembly instructions were on the outside of the box - nice idea except that the packaging people glued the Bill of Materials right over the top of the instructions (so the glue would pull the top layer off the instructions."
5,Beautiful Knitting of DOOOOOM!,"Ok, so this is a beautiful book, and though it is not out of print, it can be very hard to get hold of. The designs are mostly traditional Norwegian fair isle... But sooooo complex. We're talking mostly size 1 needles here, people, and STEEKING. (Knitters in the know will shudder now, novices get a chill of doom).But if you flip through, the work is so gorgeous that you actually find yourself wanting to dare... I actually bought the yarn pack for the cover pattern (Season of Darkness and Winter Light). The designs are gorgeous. It is if nothing else, extremely drool-inspiring. [...]."
2,Welcome to Backyard Productions!,"I like instructionals that mock the class setting, so you can see more than just the instructor perform a movement- helps you to figure out whether or not you are doing it correctly sometimes. She is a little cheesy in her introduction and starts moving off beat towards the end of her performance, plus the other girls are off sync probably due to that... that is distracting. But it is still fun to dance along. Let's face it- most bellydance videos are fun. So try to see past the cheesiness of the plastered on smiles and try not to peek into the window of the neighbor's bedroom window visible over the backyard fence behind the dancers, don't pay too much attention to the plaster Grecian statues that litter the pool deck, or the algae accumulating on the plaster of the pool... just dance and have fun- that is the only way to enjoy this video."
2,Save your money,"These stanley planes are not what they used to be. It takes way too much work to get the bottom flat on it. Save your money and buy a good brand name plane, these are not worth the money, in my opinion. I guess if you are just gonna do a door or so every now and then and it doesn't have to be flat, then I guess it would be ok, but really if you want a good plane get a lie Nielsen"
2,THOUGHT IT WAS A COFFEE TABLE TYPE BOOK,"I thought this book would be filled with photos. More of an engineering viewpoint and completely editorial. Probably an interesting read, but I was looking more for a memorial of the towers so as never to forget their majesty."
2,Where are the photos,"Having worked at One World Trade from 1985-1987 and being a native New Yorker, I ordered this book thinking I would at least get a better understanding on the construction of the towers with photos to document the history. Unfortunately those photos do not exist in this book. There a few diagrams, but no photos worth while in the book. So if you're looking for a basic understanding and would like to see the building of the towers(via photos)and to see the ""city within a city"" that it was, this isn't the book."
4,too much explanation,you want to use scripting in order to work faster. reading this book takes a lot of time. if you have some knowledge of scripting and compiling it's somehow frustrating. anyway if you dont have any knowledge or want to learn more (and use this knowledge applied to games) this is a great book that will take you to an expert level.
4,Good starting point,"This book was a nice read, following a coherent structure and didatic approach to present game scripting. The author does not only cover current scripting languages but also demonstrates the implementation of an actual virtual machine, so the reader can decide what is best for him while testing all approaches. The first part gives the insight needed for game scripting, why we need it, how it can be done in simple ways and why we need more advanced approaches. Next he discusses current languages, such as Lua (my favourite in this book), and their advantages and drawbacks. Finally the book starts detailing the implementation of an actual virtual machine, which is a very good compiler theory practice. In this sense, these chapters will make much more sense if you are is shape with Aho's Red Dragon book or Tremblay's green book. The book has its shortcomings as well, but overall it's a very well written text with good information on how to actually use scripting on games."
4,A Series Book,"I really enjoyed this book. However, despite it's attempt to be a standalone it's a much better read if you have read ""Dream Park"". The ""game"" is still central to the book but it's slightly less immersive this time around and the outside view is, at times, jaring. Despite the above it is an excellent ""stand alone"". I do hope you read all three books in order. (I haven't read the latest book...""Moon Maze"") so I can't comment there."
5,Great introduction to Operations Tools & Managerial Practice,"A very well written text on the fundamentals of Operations Management.The book covers a wide range of contemporary topics within the broad areas of Process Flows Analysis and Supply Chain Management. Many new ideas from current research in supply chain management (such as contracting, coordination, postponement, etc. ) are demystified and presented from a practitioner's point of view.The great strength of the book lies in its writing style. Each idea is illustrated with detailed factual descriptions of real organizations. At the same time, the underlying analysis is explained in an intuitive and meaningful way.Finally, a text that beautifully integrates the current practice and research in operations management."
5,This book has power to heal!,"This book will touch you on all level. Spiritual, emotional and physical. I met Michael Ryce at the workshop and he is a great teacher. His work is far superior to anything that I encounter so far, on mind/body connection. This book is a must for anybody interesting in personal growth."
3,Xbox 360 controller is better,"The good:.Plug and Play. Logitech software actually worked with XPLong Battery LifeNo problems when using a ""logitech"" wireless keyboard/mouse..The Bad:The buttons that I use for throttle and brake, which are the top ones on the front (6 & 5) are On/Off only. Either you have 100% throttle/brake, or NO throttle/brake. This is not a good thing. The wireless Xbox 360 controller has touch sensitive buttons, which help in smooth throttle and brake applications. For poor folk who don't have big bucks or dedicated space for a wheel and pedals, the Xbox gamepad is better than the logitech gamepad..Of course the problems people have with the Xbox USB receiver may outweigh the bad of the logitech."
4,Works in Windows 7 for me,"I just wanted to mention that this controller does, in fact, work perfectly fine in Windows 7, even on 64-bit (which is what I'm running). However, I will say that since I have both a 360 and a PS3, I rarely buy games for my PC that would work well with a controller. But, I have used this with no problems with just about every emulator under the sun, as well with indie games like Cave Story. Also, I've played Lego Star Wars II with it as well, and it works beautifully.Note that I have read that some of the games labeled as ""Games for Windows"" have been programmed to only work with the Xbox 360 controller for PC, such as Gears of War, but since I don't have any of those, I can't say that for sure.Again, this controller works perfectly fine in Windows 7 64-bit for all the games I have after I downloaded the newest Windows 7 drivers from Logitech's website."
1,Beware,"We purchsed two of these units. They worked for 1.5 months then we started having problems. While polite, Logitec's customer ""no-service"" offered fixes which we'd already tried and never were able to get to the bottom of the problem unless I called their phone help personnel at my expense. A month and a half later I'm still going around and around with them. They consistenly avoid my requests for a replacement unit. Now one unit works sporadically and the other doesn't work at all.In this instance, Logitec has not backed up their merchandise and they do not provide useful customer service, and they only seem to care about the customer so long as we give them money. We feel ripped off."
5,WORKS WITH MAC!!!,"I have a macbook and the description on this page said it works for mac. When I got it said PC in bold letters and had a small cd for installation that does not work with macs. So I was scared that I bought something falsely advertised but I read some reviews and I saw that one guy said it works with his Mac so I opened it up. All I had to do is put the batteries in the controller and plug the usb port in and my wireless controller instantly worked. NO SETUP! I have sixtyforce emulator and it works with that and Macmame but the vibration doesn't. I haven't played it for and other games like Madden so I don't know if the vibration works for that. Anyway, Great Controller! BUY IT!!! You won't be disappointed."
3,Cassie is Ok,"This series is about 4 sisters,all quite different.This one,in case you didn't guess,is about Cassie.Cassie is pretty and popular and wants to be rich like the new friend she has made,then she finds out her friend is not happy."
2,Compulsion,"Book exactly as described...with an extra. The book being about the Leopold & Loeb murder case...there was an original magazine article related to Leob(from 1956) and his time in prison,placed inside the book. Always nice to get something ""extra"". Thank you!!!P.S....I rate this product 5 star...For some reason, the program would not allow me to enter 5 stars on the rating."
5,One of the best books I've read in a long time!,"Wow! This was a very well written book, gradually showing us more and more of the criminals' minds and providing insights into why they committed their crime. It also gave me a lot to think about---from individual responsibility, to the purpose of punishment."
5,Don't wait for a call to get it!,"The three tracks on this import single are1. The Call (Album Version) 3:242. Shape of My Heart (Soul Solution Radio Mix) 2:513. Shape of My Heart (Soul Solution Club Mix) 7:02If you really like The Call, and don't have the album, buying this certainly isn't bad. However, if you have the album, are the two Shape of My Heart remixes worth it? The first one is a short remix, great beat, and it's the basically (with slight differences) the normal song. The Club Mix has a few parts in the middle where it's just beats and no BSB singing. But it's not one of those remixes where you hear BSB for a minute, and the other 6 minutes are all bass beats and stuff. You get a good amount of the guys singing for a Club Mix. Personally, i think it was worth it. If you absolutely detest Shape of My Heart though, it may not be for you.If you're a BSB fanatic, why would you even read a review to decide to buy it?"
1,HORRIBLE SCENT,A complete waste of money. I find it VERY hard to believe this smells good on anyone. Just smelling it out of the bottle was bad. Wearing it on my was even worse. This was the first time a lady actually said I have a bad scent on. This being the first time I didn't wear my old faithful aqua di gio. I highly recommend Armani over this bull____
4,Slow Shipping But Terrific Product,"I would have given this five starts, but the shipping was really slow. I've used this product for several years, and found this priced nicely on Amazon. The fragrance is light, has a sweet scent of vanilla and is very long lasting. It was worth the wait as this product is not easily found elsewhere. I give the product 5 stars, but the shipping experience diminished my overall experience a little."
1,HORRIBLE,"I suppose it is up to your personal taste - if you like more expensive colognes..or ones that actually smell good..stay away from this stuff..unless of course you want to smell like your grandfather..or grandmother. It really does remind me of something you'd buy at Rite Aid for like 10 bucks for your dad, like ""Musk for Men""..when you were like seven years old. Just hit myself with a very light shot, and I couldn't wait till it either wore or washed off. It's a weird smell..almost perfume-like...like a stinky aunt might wear if she didn't know any better. My own fault for buying something without smelling first, I know...just checked, and sadly, because it is a ""hazardous material"" (possibly meaning hazardous to your nose and the noses around you) it can't be returned. Glad it was only $20. I'll give it to a hobo."
3,no two bottles smell the same - red dye in cologne,"This is a decent product however after trying at least 3 bottles over a year or so Ive found some don't smell the same as others at all. Must be a shelf life or something ? My real complaint is that the cologne comes out red. Either its red to begin with or the dye on the bottle is tainting it. Its pale red , but red nonetheless.I wish they'd revise that and put a ""best used by"" date or something on it as well."
1,Not recomended to pass exam,The book is full of errors. I sent them an email saying that the practice tests on the CD are full of errors and they let me download an updated version of the tests. The new tests had the exact same errors. I haven't found this book usefull for anything. It honestly confused me more than anything.
1,This book is full errors and is missing vital exam content.,This is by far one of the worst books I have ever read. There are so many errors not only in the self tests but in the chapters and on the CD that comes with the book. The practice exam questions and answers are wrong. I totally agree with Mike this book may make you do worse on the exam if you use it!
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!,"This book was awful! Now that you know my feeling on it, I'll tell you why. Not only was this book filled with errors (but everyone expects some errors), they were critical errors that have you memorizing the completely wrong answers. I spent a week of my vacation studying this book, day and night, till I could recite the book inside and out. I was to the point that I was scoring an 98 on there 450 question pratice exam. I took the certification test today and didnt even come close to passing. 75% of what was in the book was never even mentioned on the cert test. Again let me state that I mastered this book and it didn't even come close to helping me with the certification. Not only do I feel they should pay me back for the book but also the money spent on taking the exam."
1,Barely better than nothing...,If you can't get any other book on the subject.... Still don't buy this one. You'd be better off using the help files built in to VB.
3,not sure,"Yes, the practice exam on CD was pathetic (did these guys TEST this thing before releasing it?). But the content in the book is fairly exhaustive and teaches a lot.The chapter on ADO was extremely confusing and muddling. Be careful with this book."
2,Quantity - not quality,"I agree with the other reviewer who had difficulties with the first chapter exam. I took the exam prior to reading the chapter and scored 50%. I read chapter 1 fully, retook the exam and still scored 50%. After reviewing the answers in the back of the book, half of the questions/answers are either poorly phrased or just wrong. After reading other reviewer, I can see that the other chapters will be just as frustrating. I'm hoping Syngress has updated software on their sight."
1,Have we ever heard of Quality Assurance??,"Wow! All I can say is wow. I've never, ever read a exam guide with such an incredibly poor set of exam test questions. The first chapter's exam questions were so incredibly poorly worded and, well, incorrect, that I had to put the book down and scream. For example, question 13 asks ""you have not specified a help file for a command button...What will occur if you press F1?"" The ""correct"" answer is ""A. No help will be displayed. The standard Help topic for command buttons will be displayed."" Okay, so the first half of that answer is correct, but the second half DIRECTLY contradicts it. Also, it doesn't specify whether you are in design mode or run mode, which makes a BIG difference. Of the 20 in this section, I'd say 10 had problems like this. I skimmed through the content of the rest of the book and can only say that it is hardly worth the paper that it is written on. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU LIKE WASTING A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY."
1,DON'T USE THIS BOOK EVEN NOT FOR FREE,"An awful book, don't buy this book, don't even take it for free from anyone. The book is full of mistakes, sometimes even with critical information, I usually criticize when I have something positive to say, but this one is truly the worst book ever. It is technicaly wise absolutely the poorest book I have ever had, they want you to practice but the level of the exersice it nothing like you should do. The questions in the book is nothing like the exam, it looks to me like those who wrote it have taken the exam years a go. I failed the exam, and it is mainly because of this book. So don't let yourself do the mistake I have done. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. I wish i could give it 0 stars, if you are the author you should be ashame, sorry. I love books, but i am not going to leave this book on my shelf, the pro'm is i wouldn't want to give it to anyone."
4,It worked for us.,"Two months prior to a family trip to Paris, we set about learning some French with this system. It is a class-type system, with focused listening and a workbook. It also requires some discipline. We had to adopt the discipline of ""taking a class"" - that is, we set aside a specific hour every single night, to sit down and work on French. Attempts to use the CDs in the car were futile. The GOOD NEWS is that it worked! While nobody confused us with native Frenchmen, we were able to converse, to order meals, to ask for and follow directions, and to shop with admirable results.Never confuse self-teaching with an actual classroom experience. Nevertheless, our family found this Berlitz CD to be an effective tool."
1,This one really is a stinker,"I'm a French teacher (I also teach English, Italian, German, and Spanish). I have crossed alot of Berlitz materials in my day but this one is the one I am exceedingly familliar with as it relates to my specialty.This product is really not very good. It's overpriced and you should really shop around before buying. Beware, also, of glowing reviews that seem to...well, sell the product. I have seen too many of my students spend their last few euros on berlitz prodicts, such as this one, only to find themselves with a tacky, ineffective, and utterly disappointing product."
1,Donot purchase this software,This was the biggest mistake I have made in purchasing software.The software loaded with errors and worse of all I could not get back on line to get assistance etc. I ended up talking to Dellto get rid of it. Would not even uninstall with the typical steps. I thank Dell for the help and nothing to Symantec.
1,disappointed,I have paid for my cd and HAVEN'T received it...I sent an email to the seller and he didn't respond. I am very disappointed and wouldn't recommend this seller!!!
5,Great Camera,I enjoy this camera and I carry it in my pocket wherever I go. It takes great pictures and videos.The only problem I have is that it is hard to turn on and off with big fingers.
5,I love it...,"I'm not sure what several other people were talking about, I have had no problems in low-light areas, including weddings, restaurants etc. It is a great camera easy to take pictures with and I have great pictures when I print them out. I love it."
2,"Good Looking, but Poor Pictures","I really want to like this camera. It looks great and is incredibly slim, but the picture quality is so poor I may just have to suck it up and buy another camera only 5 months after buying this one. I am not an expert photographer, but I have owned 2 other digital camera and this one takes by far the worst pictures. It is useless indoors or in the evenings. I have spent 6 months tweaking settings etc, but I cannot get this thing to take good pictures reliably. I would advise looking elsewhere for a camera."
3,"Good, until it burns by itself","I had this camera for about a month before I unplugged the dock (which the camera was sitting in) from my computer and the camera's LCD screen instantly cracked and burnt a giant hole in the middle making it all unusable. I sent the camera for repair but the lady who talked to me said that they thought it was my fault, that I had caused damage to the screen by putting pressure on it. The truth is, I did not touch the camera until a minute after it destroyed the screen. They're not putting the repair under warranty even though the camera is new and I did NOT damage the camera!!Other than that, the movie function is beautiful, amazing even. Battery life is superb. Screen brightness is amazing. The camera does take a tiny bit of a lag when shooting photos, unlike the Exilim I had before. It's tiny, stylish, and picture quality can be beautiful."
3,A Gift,I only llistened to this once & enjoyed it. It was a birthday gift for my son-in-law & he LOVED it!!! Therefore I am very happy with this product!
4,Serviceable,Good funtionality after flatting the base and sharping the blade. Comfortable to use. Not for someone who wants a ready to use product out of the box. If you have the skill to do the final finish on the product it is a good value.
4,Spokeshave works great,"This is my first spokeshave. I had to experiment a little to get the hang of it. I saw other reviews that discussed the need to sharpen the blade. I really did not have a problem. After I learned how to set the depth, I think it cuts pretty good. You just need to make sure you get a feel for which way the grain is running and set the depth just deep enough to shave the wood."
5,Plane Great,"My husband is very pleased with it. He wanted it. I ordered it. He fixed what needed to be fixed and now we're both smiling.Oh happy day.Once again, excellent product."
1,You can do a lot better...,"I needed an alarm clock when traveling. The only store that carried anything electronic was a drug store. This clock served me for over a year; but, I never liked it. I had another drug store brand that I kept dropping, knocking over, etc.; it finally quit on me.Now that I've had it with the time set button coming off, I want a new bedside alarm clock; hopefully, a better brand with an easier to use night light."
3,La Musica,This cd is only okay to me. I prefer his newer cd's from 2010 or 2011. It is okay for the price.
5,Better Than Expected,"I looked all over for a lighted magnifying mirror and was shocked to see the 3-figure price-tags from most companies! When I saw this one on Amazon for much less money, I took a chance and I'm glad I did. The fit and finish of this mirror is excellent. It is totally comparable to the mirrors that cost twice as much; in fact is there nothing cheap about the way it's made. This is a quality product that shows good, careful craftsmanship."
1,Plastic in the food!,"Wow, i am shocked to find clear plastic pieces in the jars. The other posters say they notified Earth's Best about this in August and they are still selling it without checking or recalling!! No more earth's best for my little guy. I am taking my business elsewhere and I am very sad that organic company is selling baby food with plastic and bpa in their jars. They gotta do better than this to get my business."
1,Automata and Languages Designed to Confuse Aliens.,"Languages and Machines has all the definitions of other automata theory texts, however the examples and problem sets leave something to be desired. My students could not solve the problems because the examples in no way relate to the problem sets. In fact, the examples are just statements designed to help with the understanding of definitions. Students like to see how problems are solved. My stundents screamed for the form Question-Answer in the text. This book does not deliver. I spent the majority of my lectures doing examples instead of lecturing on theory. Also with notation differences from traditional Discrete Mathematics texts and errata in a few key definitions, my students were glad to be seniors...as they probably will never have to see this text again. In short, a very disappointing second edition. I expected better."
2,This is not a 1 lb bar,"No it doesn't say 1 lb bar in the description. I was expecting a 1 lb bar based on the 1 lb shipping weight in the description. Bar only weighs 6 oz, that's 1/4 lb of polish. Shipping weight should say more like 7 oz with bubble envelope it ships in."
1,Very poorly written and borderline unreadable,"The author is very clearly a novice at writing. The first ten pages of his book are annoyingly vocabulary intensive. Rather than spending a little time familiarizing you with the terminology, the author immediately begins using every possible word in his vocabulary forcing you to have to glance at your notes. He's probably a great math geek, but couldn't teach if his life depended on it. He even attempts to trick and confuse the reader - intentionally! Don't bother with this book."
4,Should be required reading for wrestlers,"Dewey Robertson was a man who seemed to be doing well in his life with a successful wrestling career in Canada, thriving gym, good family life and his health. Through making some bad decisions he managed to lose the lot.He did this by heading to the US to seek fame and fortune but found that he needed to keep up with the other wrestlers and take drugs and drink heavily.Robertson tells a sad story of a life ruined.A good read and one in which you learn that the consequences of your actions have lasting effects."
3,very nice while it lasted,I enjoyed using the controller to play Madden 2007.. it's a shame one of the buttons is already sticking/broken.I would have liked for it to last a little longer.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.,"I have owned the cordless rumbled 2 for 3-4 years and have been disappointed with the game support on almost every game I've used it on. If the controls work standard with the game, 9 times out of 10 the rumble feature will not be supported. I wasted my money on this product because I loved the playstation style controllers and hated the xbox style. If I could go back and change my choice I would get the xbox controller without thinking twice about it. Do yourself a favor and pass on this product."
5,An excellent gamepad,"This is close to the perfect gamepad. Neither too light nor too heavy (I find some Saitek too light for instance), sturdy, good vibration, holds extremely well in my hands (I have big hands, PS2 controllers are almost too small for me and I can't hold Gamecube). I have not used the force feedback yet so I can't judge that. The joysticks work really well though, and never get stuck or loose (yet, at least). All buttons answer well, the d-pad is confortable (unlike some Saitek, again)... Yep I can't find a flaw... except one minor thing : the 9 and 10 buttons shoud be in the place of the mode and vibration buttons and vice versa. But that's VERY minor. An excellent controller indeed."
3,Ok but not great,"It's ""sort of plug n play"" If you have real simple games and dont have win7 64-bit i suppose. I just went and got pinacle game profiler to make this work easily. now i just gotta figure out pinacle. haha. overall a decent controller for the price and feels good just wish it was really 100% plug n play but maybe i need more simple games?"
5,As good as it gets,"Came here to buy this CD for the second time, broke the first one a couple weeks ago. I love the other 3 CD's but this one is the best and I can't go much longer without it. If you don't own this CD yet, do yourself a favor and get yours today. Words really can't describe the listening experience of ben folds music, all i can say is that this is as good as it gets!"
5,A must have!,"I love Ben Folds & have been an avid fan since 1996. This album introduced me to his greatness. I'd heard ""Alice Childress"" on KCRW & had to pull over in the car. I love the raw sound & fuzz bass. Ben Folds is the Beatles for our generation!"
1,This CD is trash,"I have no idea how this CD could possibly have gotten 5 stars from other people. It is whiny and annoying, and I can't stand it."
4,Killer flute player!!!,"This is my fish feeding anthem!!! I love playing this cd while I'm running around the house pretending to be a little kitty with short fat, stubby legs! It is hard to decide wich one I love the most this product or my kitty... Def. THIS CD!!!!"
4,Nebraska Sandhill Drama,"I've known about this book for years, and have at last have read it. Having driven through the Sand Hills of Nebraska a number of times, and especially the area from Running Water, the Nibrara River, and all the way to Valentine, I have wondered what it was like to settle this part of America. It is a wonder to me that anyone could have sought out this area to make a home, even if the land was free. Mari Sandoz' book about her father, Old Jules, gives us a look into the lives of such hardy settlers, and the tremendous difficulties they faced. And yet many, like Jules, made it their life's goal to stick it out and to somewhat tame the land. Mari Sandoz does a great job of bringing the reader into the presence of that time."
4,Good History,"I read this book for history purposes. Old Jules was a ""friend"" of my great-great grandfather Andrew (Andries) Van Den Heuvel who also donated land for the Sacred Heart Church."
5,A rich western resource,"I have read and reread Old Jules, savoring the stories of his life woven by Mari, his granddaughter. I am fascinated by the descriptions, the details and overall the information this writer provided with the story of her family.Definitely a must read for anyone wanting to write a western story. I will lovingly keep this volume on my shelf for many years to come."
5,Sharks for everyone,"I am a chiropractor and carry this book in my waiting room. It is a little scary, but at the end it has a ecological animal friendly ending. It is educational and fun. Both boys and girls rush to this book. I had to re-order it twice because it simply walks away with the little ones. I highly recommend this great book."
3,Shadow,"For such a short book, it took me a long time to get through it. Although beautifully written, it's a dull story. However, it's basically two stories written in one; and if you can get past the dull part, you'll love Clara's story."
1,Choking hazard,"I love all Haba toys as they are usually of excellent quality. This one, however, came apart after 2 weeks. It. is a chain of wooden individual pieces. Babies love to chew on these chains, especially while teething. Fortunately, I noticed that one of the elements came apart before my daughter could choke on it. The drilled hole in the piece must have been too big and thus caused thhe whole piece to crack. I broke it off the chain. A few days later I saw another crack on the next individual part and also broke this off, before my baby could choke on this part. I then threw the whole chain away. I am really disappointed by this product's quality and will contact Haba about this."
4,Organization,Good at keeping basement and workshop area cleaned. Bought with several other organizing items to get my husband organized quick and easy!
4,honest opinion,"This was exactly what was in the description. It fits perfectly in our shed. However, the packaging that it came in was torn and bent. But other than that, its wonderful for our little shed!"
3,"Does the job, but expensive for what it is...","The rack does the job perfectly, but 25-30 bucks for five simple pieces of plastic? Plastic shelf systems sell for this price and are more complicated in design and have more pieces.."
3,Practical Product,Happy with my choice. The unit is very practical for storing and keeping garden tools off the floor of my shed.
1,This is a great piece religious and psychological nonsense,"I love to read, and I am very open minded about very many subjects including the one of religion. I ran across this book at my library and it seemed insteresting. Thats where the interesting part ends. This person is obviously carrying on some vendetta against this religious organization. It is truly sad that anyone is responsibly allowing this author to print this sloppy redundant psychological piece of work if you can call it that. The only redeeming quality to this book is that it allowed me a chance to catch up with my sleep."
2,Bolts too short,The bolts that came with the kit were too short and I could not use the spacer until I purchased longer bolts
3,Dreaming Souls,"I am an undergraduate psychology student who did my thesis on sleep and dreams. I believe that Owen Flanagan took a great essay and tried to stretch it out into a book. The book does make some good points, but the author seems to restate his basic thesis many times over. Basically, the book is slightly repetitive and drawn-out, but anyone who is studying sleep and dreams will enjoy it, especially if they have read Dennett or Hobson because Flanagan talks about both of those guys."
2,"Should have been an essay, not a book","I wrote my honors thesis on the structure and function of dream sleep. I have read a lot of books about this subject and Flanagan is not on my list of recommended titles for other people interested in dream study (Read J.Allan Hobson if you want to know what's up). Flanagan's book is watered down, repetitive and not origional in thought. He could have condensed it into a nice 10 page essay and maybe then I wouldn't have been so irritated and bored with it."
1,Waste of money!,Picture does not reflect the real appearance of this prodict - you'll just get a piece of wood that is not even coated! Estimated manufacturing cost below 1 USD - don't by this - I will return it today.
2,Nothing like advertised,"This board is nothing like the picture. It is just a plain piece of brown board. Yes you could get this for a lot cheaper at the hardware store, but I didn't want to deal with that. So I ordered it our of convience, but this is false advertisement and I do not like or agree with that."
3,Does what I want,"It's better than Lowes Kobalt plane by a landslide, but not the old school quality I remember. Like I said- ""It's okay"""
5,An Actual Review of this Item,"I have these and love them. They are smooth and adjust easily. I bought a floor model and it didn't have numbers on the stacks--which is any easy fix. I'm a firm believer in you get what you pay for. I have the lat pull down stack as well. The nice thing about a Jones machine is you can lock the bar in position, put some plates on it and use it as a leg hold down for working back."
3,what I think of this cable crossover and jones machine,"I have this and I had read in another review that it came banged up and missing the weight stacks. That sound like the shipping company mess up which happens from time to time. My experience is that BodyCraft is there to assist there customers no matter what the problem is. I know when a a large heavy item is shipped by freight it might get a little banged up, but the items I got were pack and protect in the the boxes.This Jones machine works great and offers a great way to workout safely. It allow some one to work out by themselves and feel secure."
1,For a college grad from an English speaking school,"Totally useless for anyone but a well educated native English speaker with an accent they want to change. No Tesol grad can get anything from this material. The book reads like a post grad textbook. A truly tough read even for me, a college grad and professional and a part time English teacher.This material is completely inaccessable to my wife who is learning english as a second tongue.Waste of our money."
1,needs to be redesigned,"I've used this item several times and it simply is too short(my knuckles would hit the filter basket), and the exposed end doesn't fit in your hands very well."
4,Great tricycle,"I bought this tricycle for my 3 year old son. It seems to be a well-made, quality item. My son loves it, however the bell is too hard for him to ring on his own and if he turns the wheel to sharply, the trike will start to tip over. I also have to agree with other reviews about the size of the trike versus the recommended age range. My son is 3 and his legs are just barely long enough to pedal the bike. We have the seat at the lowest setting and when he sits on it, he can only reach the floor with his tiptoes. Granted, he is small for his age, but I don't see how a 2 year old child would be able to use this trike."
3,very nice!,"Since my child is pretty tall, she's able to ride this tricycle with ease. This should be recommended for children about 3 years old. Really an exellent buy!"
5,its a classic,I got this for my granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it. In the past I have purchased a radioflyer for my other children and they have never let us down. After she is done with it her brother will be able to enjoy it to.
3,"Great, however....","Quality no doubt. However, I almost fainted from the paint fumes while I tried to assemble it indoors. Open this item outdoors and leave it outside. Has been weeks and it still smells."
3,Good looking and easy to ride and assemble but it does tip over and the seat has no cushion.,"My 2.5 daughter just got this to replace her dora trike because I hated the plastiic wheels with no traction, and she loves it, it is a breeze riding it but I have to always be around and walk with her because it tips so easily, it doesn't have to be a sharp turn it tips with even a little turn. But unfortunately it is so hard to find tricycles with rubber wheels. And also I wish I knew the seat was metal only, no cushion at all it doesn't look very comfortable. She likes it though."
3,Just about average,"Calvin Klien has been a staple of male underwear for a while now. I don't think Vicki's makes underwear for men yet so I agree, don't get a thong! Girls who want their men in a thong are women who are obviously bored with you(their men) naked and would probably either want a woman as a partner or really would like to degrade a man to dressing like a woman. Besides, if a woman really likes the look of a thong on you, you can always just bunch up your CK boxers where needed!"
1,A woman's opinion,"My opinion as a woman: I don't understand why men keep thinking that Boxers are in and cool. Men in boxers look unatractive and dorky (my grandfather used them, they are obsolete). My female friends call boxers, grandpa pants.Thongs are the new fashion and women love to see their man in a thong. (specially fit young women).Also it is a known medical fact that boxers (aka Grandpa pants) dont provide support and whith time your parts can stretch out."
5,Good Book,I am a Latin Teacher and my students learned so much this year under this books guidance.P.S. I am not an actor
2,Bare Bones History,"Purchased as a writer's reference, History of the United States serves the purpose of providing a skeletal account of US History. It allows the reader to categorize significant influences and events, and cherry pick for further reading. I don't find the homework questions at the end of sections to be helpful, but others may, especially publishers of educational material and history curriculum developers."
5,Excellent book excellent support files,The fact that Mohler is a teacher really comes through. Unlike so many books i read which are rewrites of the manual this one really shines through: Everything is throughly tested and the book files continue to be updated at the web site. If i had anything bad to say it is that the book is thin on action script (though it is the best out there)but he explains it well. I hope he does an advanced book on focusing on action script i will certainly buy it.
5,Outstanding contribution to the carabid literature,"This book contains a wealth of information on the biology of all carabid species found in The Netherlands. Anyone who wants to learn more about this fascinating group of insects should own this attractive volume, which complements some of the other books that deal more with taxonomy. At this low price, it is also of outstanding value."
2,Straps too long & stroller strap broke easily,This diaper bag brand advertises itself as being focused on functionality for modern parents as if no other diaper bag company does that. I disagree their bag is all that functional. The straps are way too long. If you carry it in your hand not on your shoulder it touches the ground. And I'm tall. The rubbery straps on the stroller clips were a great idea because they grip to the stroller frame but one rubber strap snapped and broke already after light use for only 4 months. The bag is tall but not wide at the bottom so I can't fit as much as I'd like in it. All in all I'm glad I got this as a gift instead of purchasing it myself. I wouldn't recommend it to others. I'm now going to purchase the Skip Hop Studio bag for its larger size.
5,Much More Than a Novelty Item,"This CD would be worth it for the transcendent Banks of the River, if nothing else; but everything is top drawer here. This is certainly one of the most soulful jazz CD's ever recorded. The rhythm section, anchored by the incomparable Sly Dunbar, cooks with a slooow burn that mesmerizes. Fraser, mostly on tenor but sometimes doubling on alto, plays his heart out. Consummate professionalism, great sound, marvelous ensemble playing, tasty solos--what more could you want from a jazz CD? This one seldom leaves my most-listened-to pile."
5,Loved it!!,She is a great write with great story lines and plots. You don't want to put her books down. Just enough spice to add to the story!
3,Great love storied,"Great love story, you can feel the emotions of the characters. Highly recommend this book to anyone who appreciates the power of love."
3,2.5 to 3 stars,"I didn't like this book as much as the other two in the series. I had a hard time finishing this one, because I couldn't connect with any of the characters. I didn't like any of them. This book almost seemed like it had a different author. The story was kind of all over the place and the writing didn't flow that well. I would recommend the first two books of the series, but I wouldn't recommend this one."
1,What happened to the Original Recording ?,"I have the original 1988 tape but wanted to get it now on CDfor many reasons: TAKE THAT LOOK OFF YOUR FACE (Martie Webb)( ALL I ASK OF YOU (Cliff Richard & Sarah Brightman) THE MAGICAL MR MISTOFFELLEES (Paul Nicholas) VARIATIONS (Julian Lloyd Webber) MNEMORY (Elaine Paige - how could Barbara Streisand possibly render this any better) TELL ME ON A SUNDAY (Marti Webb), ANOTHER SUITCASE IN ANOTHER HALL (Barbara Dickson)What a huge disappointment that these marvellous renditions have not been transferred to CD. Does anyone know why, or better still how I can get a copy."
3,I give it three- one for each of michael ball's songs,"Should be renamed: ""Andrew Lloyd Webber at his Worst"". ""The Very Best of Andrew Lloyd Webber"" is a much better cd than this one; it contains all of the decent songs that are on this cd. Anyways, I think this one is a real waste of money, seeing as you could buy a more complete one for the same price."
5,Yikes!!!,"Although this early recording by this Vegan-core band out of Syracuse is laden with slightly militant overtones, I see Earth Crisis as basically attempting to do some good in this world. They helping people become more socially conscious and just make you think more. If you can see past the anger in Karl's voice and the pounding guitar riffs, then you will be impressed by the sincerity of the message. Powerful, indeed! --Kelly Magovern"
2,Not for mosquitos,I ordered this to hopefully keep the mosquitoes off my 3 year old. They seem to LOVE her. I sprayed the Cactus juice all over my daughter prior to her playing outside. The spray didn't make a difference at all. She got just as many mosquito bites using the spray as she would have without. It does have a nice smell though.
3,Shoo,I had it shipped internationally and Homeland Security made me pay.Something about the container being a risk.In the aftermath I am still saying Shoo Bug...
2,Undercooked and overly repetitious,2 1/2Sluggish electro-grime still has some of the effectively sleazy sway lost on later outings.
5,love this!,"so sad this has been discontinued! smells good, moisturizers well and I believe it's got lots of good stuff for your skin. I am 36 and acne prone and this was an awesome summer moisturizer for me. Evened my skin tone, moisturized, the whole deal. On the search for a nice moisturizer w/ salicylic acid but they seem to be very drying, geared toward the teens. This was an elegant moisturizer, but apparently not many girls knew about it. I have 1 1/3 bottle left :("
3,Who would have thought.....,"Tiffany could actually pull this off! But, she does and with style too! Her voice is much more suited to hi-nrg dance numbers and this album more than proves it. The best song on this is ""Fly"", a great number that could definitely be played during the peak hours of the club. ""Ride It"" is another great tune...very sensual and sassy in its presentation.All in all, this is a good CD to have if you are a Tiffany fan and a good introduction if you are just discovering her."
4,Surprisingly good! Four and a half stars!,"While I am not a huge fan of dance music, I have to admit that Tiffany does a great job on this CD of blending pop-music sensibilities with thumping dance-floor beats, tying it all together with soaring melodies and fresh, rarely-predictable arrangments. The CD opens with the terrific ""Be With U Tonight,"" which is probably my favorite song on the album. Other addictive tracks are ""Everyone Get Down"" and ""Artificial Girlfriend.""The music is pretty simple compared to Tiffany's amazing, well-informed ""Color of Silence"" album, but, hey, it's a party! Tiffany's out to have fun with this new album, and she achieves it. It's refreshing to see a child star really honing her craft as an adult and becoming a truly respectable artist. I look forward to seeing what she will do next!"
5,Great Product,This product was very easy to install and the instructions were well written to understand how to calibrate it with my trailer.
3,Reese electronic brakeing,"This is replacing an older unit. Works good on a 2 axle 10,000 lb trailer. The problem I'm having is that the higher the setting it will cut off ( no braking) Could be I need to know more on how to set the system."
5,Nice unit,"easy to install, easy to adjust, hardest part is deciding where to place it and not hit your knee every time you get in the truck."
3,Outdated,"Well written for what it is, but does it make sense to spend so little time on the last 55 years of the century? If anything, there should be more space as we get closer to the present, as there is more music being composed now than at any time in history."
4,Math,"Un libro con un contenido propicio para lo que buscaba, el lenguaje se entiende claramente y no deja espacio a dudas"
2,Strong Odor,I hesitate to use this product because of the strong odor. You definitely know it's with you.
1,An Injustice,"These people weren't as one dimensional as these reviews make them seem. These blurbs were so mass produced that they all could meld together and be talking about any given person. They lack depth and sincerity. ""This guy liked to ride his bike to work"" ""That woman liked her nieces and nephews."" This is a cheap attempt to humanize a catastrophe that ended REAL lives, not ones that could be summed up in a paragraph. People grieve when they LOSE something. Which of these ""obituaries"" signifies a loss for 99% of America?"
3,just the first part of the translation,This is just the first part of the book.The second haven't been released yet.
5,You know whats funny?,"This is a great album, and yes we have to mention Nirvana because Nirvana is so comparable to this album NOT Pearl Jam; though that band is great too; they're more comparable to Glassjaw. And for the narrow-minded f***-head who said Pearl Jam albums have murdered Nirvana's: F-YOU! Pearl Jam and Nirvana are on the same god-damn boat! Get over it!"
4,REFORMED Judaism Book.,"NOTICE TO BUYER: This is written by a REFORMED Jew, not an Orthodox, as I thought it was. Hence, there will be some difference between what this guy believes and what Orthodox Jews believe. It is a good book, written well. I am a Christian trying to get a better understanding of the Jewish religion and culture, and I thought this was a Jewish Orthodox book. I should have done more research. I am not going to give it a bad rating though based on that. If you want a great book written from a Reformed Jews perspective, then this is a good one for you. If not, then search for another one."
4,Nice book,"It helps me a lot with my ENG class study though some are hard to understandOverall, it is a good textbook"
5,A gem,This magazine is wounderful. It is quality embodied. Consistantly excellent writing about interesting things. The excellence of this magazine is in it's words. Graphically it is unremarkable. Black and white art type photos. No fancy graphic elements.
1,What happened to the journey?,"After revelling/reckoning(amazing recording!) I've just lost interest. I have bought evolve and her live album but after listening to this I just need a break and as someone else wisely put, so does Ani. She sounds bored and rather uninspired and desperately looking for an avenue to find the spark again. Unfortunately it's just not there. I can appreciate the loyalty some show but please, if this didn't have Ani DiFranco on the album cover would you really give it a stellar review... I think not.."
1,what ?,"what happenedto ani? This album sux. The first track isnt bad but from then on it goes downhill. Educated guess sounds to scary to listen to, but I like the bliss like this song. Ani's writing has gotten surprisingly bad and the noise in the backround is unbearable."
5,To Put It Simply...,"This album is INTENSELY personal, and is the biggest leap forward Ani has made yet. Her use of tonal colors, vivid imagery, and odd rhythms mix in this album to create a vibe that I've NEVER heard before. Although this album is ""acoustic,"" it seems important to me to point out that, if you listen to a lot of the songs carefully, there are little sound effects and things that Ani does to make the album sound different than just a vocals & guitar album usually does. In ""Swim,"" the background vocals sound like little fish swimming over your shoulder; at the end of ""Bliss Like This,"" there is this train-like sound that extends the final chord for awhile. With this album, Ani has created a full-blown masterpiece by taking the album under her complete creative control, while still referencing her beginnings. Quite the feat, if you ask me."
3,"The ""MISSING"" Song","The catchy Indian Sitar song that plays during Carter's boisterous entrance to the party, and the fight scene with Mickey Rourke is by an MCA UK band by the name Mint Royale from the June 2001 album ""On the Ropes"". This song is also playing during the ""Empty Times Square"" scene in the second release of the film Vanilla Sky with Tom Cruise.Hope this helps,-Drexel"
3,A good book,"Being business-oriented, I wish this book had talked more about how he had built up this school and ran it. It does do that but not to the level where this could be considered a business biography. From a business standpoint, this is a book about leadership and how great leadership can do great things for an institution.Oh, and the drawings spread throughout the book really help convey the man. There's a number of photographs as well, but the drawings add nice touch.If this man was really as good as the book portrays him, this won't be the last book about him and, if so, I look forward to reading those as well.While not a great book, I would recommend it. It is a thin book of nice light reading."
3,Insightful into Deerfield's school culture,"McPhee has written a highly readable account of the impact of a single individual on one of New England's important boarding schools. This work is particularly interesting when juxtaposed against similar works on the history of Groton School, St. Paul's School, or Exeter/Andover when viewing how one person can cause an entire school culture to take root. Found most often in schools where strong headmasters have either founded the school or contributed a life of service, Deerfield Academy comes across in McPhee's work as the true child of Boyden whose various quirks in no way detracted from his personal mission of making a difference in boys' lives. While by no means a critical work, ""Headmaster"" is nevertheless an important document in understanding the history of an important boarding school."
1,Hell NO,"This guy is the worst rap act out their... Only good song, Certified Gangstas, thats it. He is a Black Sterotype Rapper. The beats are O.K at most, they just put as much bass as they could, sounds bad. Bad Rap. DO NOT GET THIS!"
1,Ain't no gangsta,"This albums is tha wackest sh*t i've heard since jay-z unfinished business. Yo son don buy this crap. he ain't no gangsta. he's another comercial rappa like cam ron, only thinkin bout paper than respect."
4,Live & Loud,"This album has many examples of the excitement James Brown and his band were able to generate among live audiences. The track ""There Was a Time"" in itself is worth the price of this album. There is a lot of James Brown floating around out there, and not all of it is premium quality-however, Sex Machine is a must for both the converted and the neophyte.Although I do not think O'Boyle's ethnocentric dogma warrants comment, it does seem fairly obvious that this is either a put-on, or someone who not only understands nothing about James Brown, but has also never really listened to his music. Sex Machine was recorded in 1969-a year that, in itself, cannot help but remind one of sex, all lowbrow humor aside. If you want to talk about religion and music, why not question whether The Beatles song ""Hey Jude"" was anti-Semitic, or if the Beach Boys had a Fundamentalist Mormon agenda in mind when singing the line ""Two girls for every boy..."""
2,Not as advertised,"I got this for my dad because he saw it on TV advertised and he loves the show. He was not happy at all with it! He had seen the majority of the scenes on TV already and the video was not as uncensored as it says. They still bleep everything out, thought we were getting some raw footage but its nothing they wouldnt show on TV. Dont waste your time."
3,As expected,"Just wanted to try out my new Creative vision. Cops would look even more stupid if it weren't for how stupid criminals usually seem to be. Amazon's unbox service worked well, and I guess this episode is worth a few laughs...."
2,I expected better from Mr. Coffee,"We received this coffeemaker as a gift. It looks great on the counter, but has serious design problems. The decanter for one. I have never been able to pour a cup of coffee without it dribbling everywhere! When I hand wash the decanter, if I try to put my hand inside to clean it, my hand barely fits (I am a woman with average size hands), and when I attempt to remove my hand, it gets scratched by the plastic around the opening. I would not recommend this to anyone. I do like the look, but that is all."
4,I loved it until the day it died,"I loved this coffee maker. Unlike most of the other reviews, I had no problem wtih it what-so-ever until now. The appearance along with programmablilty is what my my decision on the purchase. The warming plate temperature control was great so the coffee was piping hot without the burnt flavor you sometimes get while drinking the last cup. It worked wonderfully for 2 years until it died on me this morning. I'm actualy pricing around for the same one, but between the other not-so-good reviews and the 2 year life span, I'm not sure now."
2,Delicate,"This worked great for a couple weeks, until it fell a few times, due to suction cup failure. On the 4th or 5th fall, the unit broke.We've replaced it with something not so flimsy.If a product's suction cup is going to be so lousy that it doesn't stick, the manufacturer needs to make a hardier product! Or just supply a suction cup that works!"
3,"Not bad, not great","My two main gripes are that (1) the suction cup tends to work rather poorly at cold temperatures, which is something you'd think they would have considered for this particular device, and (2) that it can be very hard to read the digits at an angle or in the refrigerator lighting, and if you remove it to read it, it will quickly fog up and also start heating almost immediately, resulting in an inaccurate reading. The second point is really mostly a nitpick, as it would be hard to fix this without going to a more expensive backlit LCD display, but the first point is a fundamental flaw."
5,Digital thermometer is great,"We had a compressor die on our refrigerator but wasn't sure as there were no thermometers for it.After it was fixed, I found these and ordered one got one for each side of our side by side.For this price how can you go wrong."
2,dougv,"The author uses a format where a student and teacher talk back and forth. It'stedious to read and difficult to find good chess info..Bruce Pandolfini has written several excellent books, but the others say littleworth reading.Before you buy a book of his, be sure to look at the sample pages on Amazon.comcarefully."
5,Chess Master,This a fine addition to any chess library. The service and book along with the speed of the delivery were just as advertised. I am really enjoying the purchase .
4,"Great book, but wording is not the best.","The book is very good, particularly for chess beginners and step beyond.The wording of the book, that is a conversation among a pupil and his professor is a little dense."
1,Piece of garbage,"It does not help & is a piece of garbage. Even if you wanted this for interesting electro sensations, it's garbage. Get a tens unit & pads for this type of therapy or kicks, not this ""hocus pocus"" trash. The electrodes are not ajustable as it says in the intructions, so if you try to adjust them as per instructions, you'll just break it. It's very hard rigid plastic with hard metal electorodes sticking out... very uncomfortable. It will not sit an any head for even contact or comfortably. It will leave lots painful dents on your face for a long time. It's useless for beauty, therapy, or kicks."
5,This does work! I see it and others tell me how great I look,"I will tell you when I put this on around my husband he won't look at me and says I look scary BUT I will tell you it WORKS.It takes down the puffiness of age and smoothes the lines. My cheekbones look great and the feedback I get from friends and family proves it works. Little do they know, I've go my mask making it happen. Let's face it, gravity and ageing happens, why not take 15 minutes a few times a week to look your best?I highly recommend it. Follow the directions carefully and make sure to clean it properly after each use. Also make sure you are shipped a NEW one not used."
3,Needed a cheap hockey mask...,"On the request of my probation officer, I joined a local Inter-urban hockey team for delinquent minorities. I was axed to play goldie but had no money for an adequate helmet. In a rare stroke of luck, I found this kit at a local Goodwill for less than 20 dollars. Now pucks hitting my face hurt less, plus I will retain my natural youthful skin for years to come. THANKS REJUVINIQUE!"
5,Martial Arts roots run deep!,It is great to see the history of the founder of my style Goju Ryu. I am honored to be apart of this great system and now can fully understand and appreciate where my roots came from. The depth of the history makes this best explaination of Goju Ryu I have ever seen.
5,"The best LIVE ""ROCK"" RECORDING ever done... period","""The Fillmore Concerts"" contains material, and alternate takes, from the concerts orginally released on ""Live at Fillmore East"" and ""Eat A Peach."" Boy howdy, were these guys TIGHT?!!! (Especially considering the fact that they were doubtlessly imbibing in consciousness-altering chemicals at the time!) The Brothers are generally categorized in the ""Southern Rock"" bin, and their southern roots are doubtlessly an influence. But they go far beyond that stereotype as they pay homage to the blues. Duane Allman and Dicky Betts trading guitar solos, or playing trademark ""twin guitar,"" the joyous rhythm section featuring 2-3 drummers, Gregg Allman on keyboards and lead vocals... these guys are COOKIN'! If you like the blues, and some tight jammin' DON'T MISS THIS ONE!"
1,An Old friendship renewed,"Anyone familiar with the greatness of this band needs to revisit it with this release. The remastering of the original material has brought out aspects of play that previous technology couldn't match. All the play stands out with such clarity. The ""Whipping Post""rendition here showcases the experimental guitar styles of both Duane Allman and Dickie Betts as they take turns wandering through various ideas and concepts and still return to the dynamic central theme. There are no disappointments on either CD. Just a concrete reminder of the loss to the music world when Duane died and a nostalgia for the days of the true super groups. This is an incredible live album and deserves to be played loudly on a digital surround system to begin to grasp the scope of this group's live show."
2,kind of boring,"i guess because it wasnt written from either the police or prosecuter's point, it just didnt keep my attention too long.all i know is i wouldnt read it again."
3,Ok book,"It told the story, but really didn't keep me interested. If you are just looking for the facts, this book will work."
4,A must have!,Thought this book was great. Used it often at home when cooking and ran out of ingredients. It was a life saver while living in South America. I became the living encyclopedia for substitutions to all my friends in Argentina. Have had this book for a number of years and continue to find it very helpful. It would make a great gift for expert and novice chef alike.
2,What happened to the bass?,"I have gone to see the Moody's three times in the last ten years, the first time with the full blown orchestra ala Red Rocks. I've always enjoyed their music and was excited to see the concert come out on CD. Then I listened to the CD and scratched my head, granted they never were a ""heavy"" group but John Lodge's bass lines were a foundation for their songs and it is missing in action. I tried cranking up the bass control but there's nothing there! What a disappointment! Did I just get a bad copy or is everybody else reviewing this album listening on a 2 inch speaker. I don't listen to it anymore because I find such pansy sonic quality irritating. Tiny Tim on the mixing board!"
1,Skippy!,"I had our secretary buy this specific pen after using another model and am pretty disappointed. Yes, the ink dries fast, and I'm left-handed, so that's nice. However, this particular pen skips on normal paper--pads, post-its, everything. It skips enough that it's pretty much unusable.The other style (model SAN33921), with a cap instead of a retractable tip, is great, dries fast, and doesn't skip at all. I've only got one of those, and I've lost the cap, but I still keep it resting at the top of my keyboard because it's just a nice pen."
3,Its ok.......,"ALot of the footage that is discernable is not from Master Soken but from some other guy.There is some footage of the Hakutusuru(or so the narrator Claims) but it was very short.The peices of the weaponry/kata performed by Master Soken are excellent.I reccomend it only if you have the extra $$ to throw around , it isn't all that great but is ok for the enthusiastPS(The narrator becomes quite irratating)"
1,ALSO RECEIVED WRONG ITEM --DONT PURCHASE,"I ordered this saw blade too, and when my package finally arrived I discovered that I had received a pressure washer nozzle???? I returned the item to Amazon warehouse deals and still have not received a credit!"
4,It's a net,Plastic threads aren't my favorite. We will see how the hold up as I change between net and skimmer often. Would of liked a little finer mesh. But hey.. it's a net and it nets.
5,needed to cut roofing and 1/8inch plate steel,Ordered the saw and had it in two days cut the metal roofing and 10 foot of 1/8 inch steel for a bench top then some 5/16 aluminum with no blade change or time lose. Straight and cool to handle with no mess fine tool.
2,Inexpensive and built that way!,This is not a high quality saw. Blade was not at right angle to the base. No bevel adjustment. Returned to Amazon. Check out the Evolution brand of metal cutting saws. http://www.evolutionpowertools.com/
5,Best Frog Eyes Release To Date,"""Tears of the Valedictorian"" is Frog Eyes' best effort to date. Years of touring and recording have caused the band to become tighter as a whole, and the addition of Spencer Krug of Wolf Parade on keyboards fills out the sound expansively. Also, additional years of playing have benefited the drummer immensely, who only began playing shortly before Frog Eyes was conceived. Tracks such as ""Bushels,"" ""Reform Your Countryside"" and ""Evil Energy, the Ill Twin Of . . ."" are undoubtedly among the greatest Frog Eyes' tracks to date."
4,Lessons of lives,"Having our say is an increrible story of two sisters. It makes us think about our lifes and makes us question ourself.Who am I? Where am I? Where do I want go? We then can start or continue on to plan our future with the basic lessons of love, good health,relationships,to have a better life."
4,Very interesting,The Delany sisters were a very inspiring and uplifting book. Hearing the the obstacles of heavy prejudices against minorities and what they did to overcome them was very inspiring. It was also very interesting to see how too totally different personalities overcame the same obstacles just as well as the other. The main theme of the book is the great power of love and that no obstacle is too big for it. There is an abundant amount of wisdom of how to handle some of the worst difficulties in life. The time period is irrelevant.
4,Successful Aging at it's finest,The book was great. I chose the book for a class assignment but when I read it. I truly enjoyed it.
1,Having our say,"I thought this book had a lot to say, but not a lot got through to me. I thought the two ladies on the other hand were amazing watching life change and being two Females and African American.Being a person of disability I can relate to the two ladies in society that has flaws when it comes to people who are not the standered but stand out. The book should have had a little more dialogue, somtimes the book would just leave me dangling in mid air. I do encourage you to try it I'am very good reader and my standards are very high because I'am handicap and I can't enjoy the great life of walking so I pick up a book and read."
2,Racist,"This book had a lot of racism in it, & although it was very informational on our american history, Bessie Delany didn't need to be so racist against whites in this book. But i kind of enjoyed it, but it was the best book i've ever read."
4,Aristotle's 'Politics' still essential,"The Greek philosopher and scientist Aristotle possessed one of the most remarkable intellects of all time. He contributed to the body of knowledge in areas as diverse as logic and biology, ethics and physics, psychology and politics. Although his work 'The Politics' has been widely published, few versions have been as effective as this in placing his political commentary into the conext of his time. Certainly this contextualisation is this edition's greatest strength, and the feature which most clearly sets it apart from most other currently available translations.'The Politics' remains an essential feature in the literature of politics and philosophy. Whether the reader is a first year political science student or a senior lecturer seeking to replace that well-worn second (or third) copy of an earlier edition, the particular book will be the ideal choice."
4,Philosophy Major's Only,"This is an unabridged text of this important piece of literature. If you want to read it out of curiosity, I recommend the abridged versions, any of them, over an unabridged version. If you're a Philosophy or Pre-Law major in school, or just like to read old English dialogue, which is literally weight lifting for the brain, then get this book and the others in the series"
4,If you like high-energy R&R and a gutteral singer!,"This band is not as polished as some others of the Rock & Roll genre, but they do have a lot more energy (and fun it seems) playing their music. Some of their rock makes you wanna roll and dance and get all excited! They have moments of greatness (Johnny Guitar every so often lights it up!) and could have been a major influence with a bit more polish and better agents. Overall, I'd rate the music as very exciting and fun to dance/listen to."
5,YOUR BAD!!!...,All that you can say about anything that this family puts out is that it is BAD!!! Karen you did a awesome job on this CD. More than that I was pleased to see that you yourself left a comment on this page. That tell that you really care about your fans. Thanks. I can't wait till the day I get to meet you...Sir. Arke
2,Very Disappointing,I have always been a huge fan of McKenna but I found this book very disappointing. I felt like the purpose of this book was to show off her homeopath knowledge! Hopefully this is just a misstep and her next book will be up to her usual standards.
4,PLUMERIA PERFUME,THE ITEM I RECEIVED WAS WHAT I EXPECTED. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT I WANT A BIGGER BOTTLE AND THAT WASN'T AVAILABLE ON AMAZON.
1,TERRA NOVA PLUMERIA PERFUME,When I lived in Hawaii as a child I loved the scent of Plumeria and when I read all of the positive reviews of this product I decided to give it a try. I can not say how disappointed I was with the scent as it does not even remotely smell like the Plumeria flowers I remember in Hawaii. I called the Terra Nova company (which should be called the Terrible Nova company) to return the perfume and I was told that I could only have a store credit and not a refund. I don't want a store credit as I purchased and was disappointed with the only product that they offer that I was interested in. My review would have to be that not only does their perfume STINK but that their service STINKS as well.
1,WARNING! WARNING!,"This disc is labeled ""enhanced"". What it is is ""Copy-protected"".It cannot be digitally copied at all. It will not play in Itunes or Windows Media Player. It comes with player software installed on the cd. I think shoppers should know this and not waste their time buying it if they want to play in on their computers and transfer to portable devices. I was intrigued by this artist and wanted to try her work. But, this is a rip-off because of what I have mentioned. It also may not play in some cd players because of the copy-protection. I though others should know. Amazon dropped the ball on this."
1,shipping took forever!,I figured i would buy this online since it was cheaper than in the stores and my fish had about 4 days left on their food. if i waited my fish would have probably died.lol. i had to go out anyway to buy fish food because the shipping was soo slow.
5,Ordered to Return,"I read this man's first book Return from Tomorrow in 1984 it changed my life, this one goes on to share how he used his experience to help others. Brilliant. I hope I can be used in such a helpful way too. I couldn't buy the book in Australia so I love that Amazon ship worldwide."
1,"If you need someone to tell you what to think, buy this.","Earth Crisis is what gives the straight edge scene a bad name. Preachy, annoying, unsubstantiated dribble with a rascist edge.Don't destroy the machine, destroy the CD and think for yourself."
4,very solid cd from sxe king of vegans,this cd stand out because it's the one cd that constantly is on a even feel no highs no lows just heavy grooves.the cd flows smothly from sond to song.I like their later freya work better.
5,This cd rocks,"I don't care about straight edge hardcore XXX or whatever that [...] is. I have no opinion either way on their message. I just like the music and vocals. You people think too much into things. I like this because it sounds good. It's got great riffs, solid vocals, and decent production. This is the band that hatebreed tries to be."
3,Will last forever but sticky doors,"I generally like the units. They went together easily with a rubber mallet. However, two of the eight doors (two units) stick. When opening or closing they stick and the side of the unit bulges out. I did not have the unit level while constructing but subsequently leveled it. The leveling and filling the unit up with stuff helped the situation. I like the plastic construction because I live in a salty air environment so metal is not a good choice."
1,Received condition,"Maybe Rubbermaid makes a good product but by the time I received this unit, it was already damaged. Possibly because of poor packaging. The replacement was in no better condition, at which point I cancelled the order because the experience so far did not give me cause to believe that this product was durable.I was then charged the shipping costs by Amazon for a product that I eventually never received.Last transaction I will ever do with Amazon."
2,Disappointed,Instructions are printed on on side of box. This is your only manual for assembly. Plastic cut-outs that should have been scraped at mfg. plant left inside some parts. Tolerances for doors closing and openings allow too much play. Assembly instructions were poor. I do not reccommend.
2,What a piece of junk!,"This is the shoddiest piece of plastic you'll spend $200 on. The holes for the poles to slide through were poorly punched, and there were punched out plastic discs lodged inside the panels that will slide and rattle unless you fiddle with them and pry them out. Due to poor craftsmanship and poor packaging on Rubbermaid's part, most of my edges where the holes are were all crushed, beaten up, deformed etc. causing the fit and finish of the product to be horrible. The doors are sloppy and don't close all the way. You have to repeatedly open and close them while banging the plastic parts to get everything to set in and it still looks like crap. Doors feel like they catch on certain parts where the plastic was damaged during packaging/shipping. However, it is quite large and roomy, 3 shelves, the storage shelves themselves are slotted to reduce debris build up on the shelves. In the end it does its job as a cabinet but just is poor quality and looks like crap."
4,Rubbermaid 7083 Cabinet Review,Product arrived in a timely manner and was in very good condition. I had expected to have purchased a brand new cabinet but someone has previously done all the punchouts prior to assembly with some slight tearing but not enough to effect the overall quality of the product. Suits my needs perfectly. Wish that this product were more readily available from a local retailer.
1,I returned this for a refund,This item split and pretty much collapsed during construction. I disassembled it (no mean feat) and returned it for a refund.
1,The Hopelessness of 'Hope' - A Study in Outdated Orientalism,"The title should have put me off the book. The review of a particular pseudo-academe should have warned me of the shallowness and ingrained `cultural' single-vision of the author - but I went ahead and entered a feast of illiteracy and generalizations the like of which exists only in medieval travelogues. If one believes that an Arab barely makes it as a human being, this book is a gem. It eases the suggested pains' of encountering an Arab and the implied `torment' of visiting an Arab country.On the other hand, if one considers the Arabs as a group of peoples with differing cultures, habits and customs, some of which do accord with Western (even Orientalist) perception of culture, other do not, then the book is offending, insensitive and is a caricature of an anthropological sketch."
5,Packed with Knowledge!,"Margaret K. Nydell has recast this cross-cultural guide to getting along with Arabs in a new light in the midst of the war on terror. In so doing, she navigates sensitive territory, a no-man's land stuck between understanding another culture, and becoming an apologist for its negative behaviors. Properly executed, cross-cultural guides enhance one's awareness of the vast cultural gap between social norms and customs. Occasionally this volume lapses into cultural generalities, but that's inevitable when you're trying to explain norms of some 20 diverse Arab countries. Understanding Arabs will help you do just that, and although it may not shed a lot of light on the current conflict, it's very timely. We from getAbstract highly recommend it to anyone who wants a better understanding of Islam and Arabs. As Nydell says in her introduction, seeking understanding should not be confused with appeasement."
3,Doesn't seem to hold up well under use.,"Although I have had this gauge for several years, it has not been used frequently. Lately it has begun to give erratic readouts such that I no longer trust it. In my opinion this device should withstand usage better than this. I will not buy another."
1,Accutire MS-4004B Digital Tire Guage,"Has several good features, grip,accurcy and fancy case but I HATE this gauge. It is an absolute pain in the A** to align perfectly on the valve stem. It has no rubber seal like found on most cheaper guages. The hard plastic is very difficult to position quickly for a good reading and most always loose air trying. Don't waste your money on this one. If you still want one you can have mine."
1,Aviod this tire guage,"I have purchased two of these guages and the results are the same, poor. It is very difficult to line this guage up with the valve stem to get an accurate reading. My daughter tried it and lost air trying to get an accurate reading. This product is a waste of money and its accuracy is in doubt."
3,Where's the Tech Support?,Who is the maker or official website?Where is the Tech support site for warranty or details?
4,Goodnight for Justice,"Another great Luke Perry western to watch on those ""Western Movie Weekends."" I thought it ironic that the punishment for the ""Alcoholic Lawyer"" was the Governor making him Circuit Judge over the territory that so haunted him from childhood to now. Awesome!"
3,Not sure,"Athlete came on the scene a few years ago. I heard one of their songs on a Q Magazine CD and was impressed. They played a lot in Europe and I forgot about them. Now they are on their second record and it is very promising. ""Chances"" and Half Light"" are very distinct sounding songs. It's a little more electronic sounding than a Keane song. This album has a bunch of weird minimal songs, but nothing really grabs you. There is Coldplay and Snow Patrol, and suppose that many people would rather be in those bands than Athlete. There is brilliance to some of these songs, but they don't really drive me to any emotional state. Mostly music connects with people on some emotional level. I bet people out there are crazy about the sounds of ""I Love"" but it doesn't do anything for me. I prefer Long-View and Low. Those are bands that make intimate music that I relate to."
5,Excellent,"If you like music from the Coldplay, Keane and Radiohead genre, you will enjoy the music from bands like Athlete, Embrace, Snow Patrol and The Fray. This is quite simply good music with good lyrics."
5,"CD of the Year: ""Tourist"" by Athlete","I went to a U2 concert in Amsterdam, and came away an ATHLETE fan for life. Athlete was booked as an Opening Act. When they got through with their 'shorted' one-hour+ set, I left the stadium wondering if U2 even played.From first to last song, Athlete plays as seasoned performers. The melodies layed on keyboard echo full, and true alongside the harmonics intoned on vocals. The CD clips along, and frequently plays twice, or more before realizing the CD-auto repeat is on... From resounding/anthemic sing-a-longs to booming-rockers, this CD does not disappoint.I've also bought MP3's from ""Vehicles and Animals"" and find flashes of brilliance that ""Tourist"" captures throughout. Will look for tickets whenever/wherever Athlete performs for years to come..."
2,eh.....,"Well,The title of this movie is all wrong,it has absolutly NOTHING to do with Witches.It's low budget and has no real facts to it.It's about catholic school girls who turn into satanists.Although,for some reason it does have some entertainment value to it."
3,GOOD BUT TOO MUCH NUDITY,"I must admit that I liked this movie. It is a classic teen horror. The only part that I could do without was the useless nudity, but the story itself was interesting. It's filled with fun and fantasy. It's a must for anyone who liked THE CRAFT, or is into the supernatural."
3,Its not that bad!,"I felt overall that the movie did not live up to its promise or what it could have been, but its still worth watching.It has its moments.I like occult-themed movies.There were a few parts in the movie I found scary -like when they were calling the demon.I don't regret buying it .Its not a bad way to spend a few hours."
1,Fast forward review,"Sleaze fans expect certain things from satan in girl's school films, some shower or getting ready for bed nudity, maybe a little girl-girl playing around in the dorm at night when the matron's not looking, and then of course the usual cult dancing around nekkid or in robes scene, an altar scene with the fount of all evil himself or maybe a stand-in wearing goat horns about to get the virgin before the hero shows up (these cults always have lousy security), and if you're really lucky, some tied-up babes being abused or maybe a flashback witch burning.Well, sorry, this doesn't deliver, with the sole exception of the dancing scene, which is acceptable, disrobing to full nudity and no cute stuff with the camera. So, one star, but that's mainly because I like plumpers and the blonde dancing around the well, or whatever it is, is kinda cute for a fatty. Hey, no accounting for taste."
4,Pink Floyd - Real artists at work,"Pink Floyd - 1973 - Darkside of the Moon is released - immortality is assured. BUT... In 1972, while working on Darkside they put together the ""Live"" movie. The ampitheatre in Pompeii is the scene for some of their best pre-darkside music. No crowds, just the technicians. This is real Pink Floyd head music, Good Stuff! with casual interview comments by the band and even a scene at breakfast spliced in. Pink Floyd made a lot of records and did a lot of living before Darkside, and who knows who these guys really are? Well this movie just gives a glimpse. But it's better than nothing."
5,Exactly What I Ordered,"I just ordered two of these sets, and both came as advertised. Each package contained two memory cards at 1gb each. And together, they work exactly as you would expect 4gb of memory to work.I felt I had to leave this review so that people aren't put off by the previous reviewer who claims to have ordered this product and received only one card."
5,A Crucial Upgrade,Memory upgrades can be tricky but Crucial Technology makes upgrading your computer memory very easy. I purchased the 2GB memory kit from Amazon and it worked like I expected. My computer booted-up without any problems after I installed the 2 memory modules and the over all operation is remarkably improved. I recommend this product to anyone needing a similar upgrade.
1,"Never got it, don't know","Never got the product, must have been delivered to an incorrect address. Got a full refund."
5,"A lyrical masterpiece, straight from the underground","Aceyalone has always been one of the great underground emcees in the game. His lyrical talent is unmatchable, and he is, in my opinion, THE GREATEST MC OF ALL TIME. This is a classic; it has everything you want in an album, including masterful lyrics. Standout tracks: Arhythamaticulas, All Balls, Mr. Outsider."
3,Great experience,"This book was interesting but wasn't as informative in the battles, but was very informative as far as the political aspects. Book arrived quickly and in good condition."
2,If you like your prose purple...,"I found this book to be polemic as all get out. The monograph was a black and white portrayal of history told in a Cowboys and Indians style that was frustrating to read if the reader is looking for depth and ambiguity in the subject.In the interests of keeping it positive: if you like your prose purple, if you like your journalism yellow, if you love reading the The Sun, and are glued to Fox News, then this is the book for you!"
5,luv ingrid,"ingrid bergman gives such a wonderful performance, grace, class, and style. she is in luv and her lover is a playboy but a younger man wants her attentions"
2,There's no there there...,"Part way through I found myself wondering why I was still watching themovie. It was nice to see Ingrid Bergman 20 years after makingCasablanca, but I just couldn't care that much about her dilemma inthis film.One major detraction is Anthony Perkins. He has no business being inthis movie. I know he belongs in 'Psycho', but I don't think he's a fit as Bergman's younger lover.What's great though is the many outdoor shots of Paris in the 60's unrolled early in the film. Theautomobiles. Wow! Really great street scenes, night shots of Paris, andagain, those goofy looking cars.And then there's that knockout Jocelyn Lane. She's doesn't last theduration of the film however, and that's really too bad."
5,Still strong,"This was one of the first drum 'n' bass albums I ever picked up, and in many ways it has spoiled me. I always find myself returning to the very smooth beats of Coxon and Wales. They do quite a bit with the form on this album, and they have proven to be one of the most interesting drum 'n' bass acts around. There's the Morricone-esque ""Midwest"", the throb of ""Pan"", and the dark and sinister ""Roger Tessier"". This is a really smooth, fine album that one can play straight through. May not suit hard jungle fans, but offers a very nice palette of sounds in what many think is a severely limited genre."
3,Parts of it good; parts of it less so,I was expecting less photos and more text on the history of each major linen manufacturer. THe photos were very good though. Having a price range is good however it would be more useful to give a change in price over the years. These cloths have been collected over a long time and the author should have an idea of the appreciation of the items.A rarity rating would have been useful too.I enjoyed flicking through it but would I have bought it if I hadn't done that first. Maybe not.
4,first Hagin book,"I haven't really ever seen myself as being ""in the faith movement"". Though I have been a christian for a long time, I have never read a book by K. Hagin. This was my first and I was pleasantly suprised. I found it much more balanced then I thought I would have. He takes care to distinguish between what he sees as valid christian suffering and other forms of pain and suffering that we should outwardly reject as Christians. In one place he says: ""Suffering will make you grow up spirtually in a hurry."" and, ""It is well to remeber that some of our hardest tests are God's way of leading us into a deeper place in Him"". Yet he insists that we are not to ""magnify the suffering"" in such a way as to overshadow the blessing and the good that God wants to bring in it."
3,Not what I expected after the Baby Whisperer book,"I really enjoyed the Secrets of the Baby Whisperer and had given it as gifts. So when my daughter became a toddler, I knew I had to see what Tracy said about 'toddlerhood'. I guess I was expecting too much of her...it just seemed like so much of the same from her first book and a lot of common sense.If you didn't read the first book and have a toddler, get this book, otherwise, don't bother."
1,Went against everything I believe,"This book really made my skin crawl.It is so far from the idea of attachment parenting. It focused on the parents needs more then the baby's. They are only little for such a short time. Why not love them , hold them and cuddle as much as they want? what is more important, sleep or having your child feel safe and loved? After I read the book I gave it to my 9 month old baby and let him do what babies do to books. A much better use then keeping it in my library."
2,Inferior cast recording,"""Joseph"" is a great musical comedy. I have directed it twice now and really appreciate its simplicity and childlike innocence. That is why I feel this Canadian cast recording is overblown, with hit-you-over-the-head orchestrations and wall of sound production. The Narrator is especially ingratiating with a lackluster interpretation and weak vocals. I haven't heard either New York cast albums. I would hope they are better and purer."
4,1992 CD vs 1999 video,"I saw the 78-minute video on PBS and was so impressed by the music that I wanted to get the CD. I liked the singing voice of the narrator (Maria Friedman) in the video better than the one (Janet Metz) on the CD. Donny's voice sounded much stronger in the video than on the CD (and with more feeling). I think there should be a CD made from the video. Pass this on. It's still a good CD, but it's time to upgrade to 1999. Thanks."
5,My personal Favorite,"I saw Joseph when it came to town in '93 and loved it ever since!!! I listen to it constantly, and it is like a bedtime story, for the whole musical is on the cd. Donny is the perfect Joseph. THis role was made for him. I lvoe the video, but this cd is better because everyone sings, instead of talk-singing (which is my biggest pet-peeve). I abosolutely LVOE this musical!!! I want to do this musical at my high school next year, because it is the best musical ever!!"
4,Donny Osmondan as Joseph,"fun Musical- great costuming- I should know I did this musical in Children's Theatre when I was in the sixth grade-Believe me Donny Osmondan has great vocal range- he's excellent as joseph, However when we did it (with my now elederly mother as the stage manger!!) the guy who played Jospeh Adam ( sixteen at the time) well, let's just say at the point I had a huge embrassing cursh on him that I still to this day never told anyone about (except my mom on one ocssain) what A hunk!!"
5,Just what I wanted,The CD came in great condition and is what was listed. Very pleased with purchase.
3,A good plan C,"If you loved Donny Osmond in the video, you won't be disappointed with him in this recording. His performance as Joseph was just as outstanding in 1992 as it is to date.However, if you were enamoured by Maria Friedman's performance in the video or Laurie Beechman's performance in the original cast, you may be disappointed by Janet Metz in this version. Her ear-splitting pitch is a far cry from the smooth richness and exciting emotion pulled of by Friedman and Beechman.Aside from the occasional cringe at some of the narrator's solos, this is a good substitute if you've got an itch for Joseph and can't get your hands on either the video soundtrack or the 1982 original Broadway cast recording."
2,"Helpful for an overview, but useless for advanced details","This book is great to get a high level overview of how IP phone services work. However when you get to the nitty gritty of writing an application, this book is mostly useless. Yes, there are lots of examples on how to do very basic things like display a menu on your phone. However, as another reviewer pointed out, there are no detailed examples of how to do anything advanced.One example, I want to get information about the device hitting my service. There are 2 paragraphs explaining why I might want this information, but on how to get it, this book only says ""You can use the Cisco URL Proxy to gather additional information..."". No where in the book does it give any more details on how this is used. One more sentence - like 'your service should read these xml pages to get the device info' - would have been infinitely helpful. I found that the Cisco SDK documentation has everything that is in this book and more."
3,relatively boring with few bright spots,"Compared to other Dave Ralph releases, this CD is very repetitive in an annoying way. I'm not a fan of simplistic banging beats, so my bias is showing here. Ralph's track selection is heavy on the straight-forward thumping and crashing, lacking the polyrhythmic and melodically intricate sounds that make Tranceport 2 so hypnotic and engaging. It seems that he, like so many other DJ's, got swept up in the anti-trance sentiment of the last couple of years, moving away from anything with emotional expression or musical complexity. Hopefully this trend has peaked and we'll see a broad spectrum of ""trance"" and related genres being released, and there won't be any more musical abortions like this one from an otherwise excellent DJ.So why do I give it 3 stars after roasting it? Cuz it ain't quite as bad as I'm makin' it sound! It just annoys me that he didn't follow up Tranceport 2 with something of comparable quality."
4,"OUT, OUT DARN SPOT !","More than just a treatment, more than just makeup, Clinique CX Soothing Concealer Duo is both plus SPF 15 for added protection. Whether skin needs calming and camouflaging following dermabrasion or a chemical peel or just a tiny spot that needs to be hidden this item does the trick.The concealer is a simple two step product. First apply the concealer, which is very lightweight. You can build upon your initial application until desired coverage is attained. I found that if applied following foundation it even masks a tiny scar from childhood.Next set the concealer with the sheer setting powder. This step ensures all day wear. Containing silica, the powder gives skin a smooth, flawless appearance.A dual-sided brush applicator is included in the compact. Use the shorter side of the brush to apply concealer, then lightly pat with fingertips. With the longer side of the brush tap setting powder over the concealed area.Presto - a smooth, even complexion.- Gail Cooke"
3,Fair,Great band alright CD. first song was good and then the others were alright but still love the band from the bay!
4,Combines modem and router and works fine,"Bought this to replace an old Netgear 802.11b compatible router and Westell modem. Love having a single unit and you can't beat Netgear's easy setup. Wireless computer in another room gets a good signal. Overall, it works just fine for my needs."
4,good value,Product works just fine and for the price I think its a good buy. I had to get help through their customer service department to get it set up. That was a hassle. They spoke broken english and it was very hard to understand them
4,Good product,I am quite pleased with this Wireless Router/Modem combo and purchased it so I would only need one device rather than two seperate devices. It has performed just fine so far and I only have a few reservations . One is the fact I have an amber light on one of my LAN connections and I cannot find out why . The connection works ok but am unable to determine why the amber light. The other thing is I set it up to notify me by email of any intrusions on my network and so far no intrusions but I get an hourly email from the router for no apparent reason .
1,Junk,"This won't keep a connection to the DSL line for more than 15 minutes without dropping it. I have to reboot it at least 3 times a day, as half the time when it drops, it won't reconnect. This is way worse than the 2-wire DSL modem provided by AT&T. Useless for any kind of online gaming."
2,Probably not for AT&T in SoCal,"I plugged this one in and setup was easy. LAN networking was painless using default settings.The problem is that it won't connect or maintain connection with SoCal AT&T; ADSL (using my reliable fixed IP), where other modems will. When it's connected, it's fine, but when there's a power outage or other interruption it will not re-connect. Tried everything, including tech support. They think it's defective, but I don't. Anyhow, back it goes."
1,Too thin and fragile,The stockings are too thin and not even drugstore quality. They almost got a snag just from me gently opening the package. I suspect that these will last for one wearing or less and that's not worth my $$$. Better to spend a $3-5 more and get something that can be worn and washed and so forth. These are simply too poor of quality for all that.
5,My all-time favorite CD from a true crooner.,"Will Downing has never made a bad album but this one is my all-time favorite. Will's jazzy and liquid baritone is at its best on such Quiet Storm gems as ""Sailing On A Dream"", ""One Moment"", ""Lover's Paradise"" and ""That's All"". The unabashedly jazzy title track is my personal favorite Will Downing track (still sends chills up and down my spine!) If you are into REAL music that will touch your heart and soul then waste no time in buying and enjoying this CD."
2,You'll need additional items to use this product.,"The rails work with my existing bed, the problem is they don't tell you that you have to have additional cross boards to support the mattress. In addition, once you place the cross boards on the rails, the mattress no longer is held in place, so I had to lower the supports on the rails to keep the mattress from sliding off the bed. Its a poor design. A lot of work had to be done to make these functional rails."
3,Tensions simmer between brothers,"These RTA series of books are based on the television series that ran for seven seasons during the 90s. The show is beloved by fans and is one of the best family-friendly shows ever screened on television. I have all the DVDs and watch them every year. These books follow the television episodes quite faithfully.Alec King has never really got along with his younger brother Roger who left Avonlea to pursue a career in geology, leaving his son Andrew to be looked after by Alec and his family. When Roger returns for a visit, old tensions resurface. Things are made worse when Roger interferes with the way Alec runs the family farm. This is one of the few story lines where we get to see Alec lose his usually calm composure. This story is perfect for young adult readers and also fans of the show who wish to collect these books as keepsakes of the show."
5,Excellent Reference Guide,"This book is an excellent reference guide for identifing gulf and bay fishes, and contains very little ""how-to"" information. Fish are separated into families. Each fish has a detailed color illustration, common name(s), and scientific name, plus a short description of each of the following categories: physical description, range, habitat, typical sizes, food value, game quality, typical tackle and bait, and a very short description of typical fishing methods. 185 fish are pictured in all, including sharks, stingrays, baitfish, and a number of other fish that may be encountered even though they are not normally thought of as sportfish."
4,Tropical Storm Hannah do your worst,"What better situation to test the durability of a rain jacket than during a tropical storm escorting ladies from their cars to a baby shower?I had wanted a lightweight versatile rain jacket for quite some time. Enter the Marmot PreCip rain jacket. For a mid priced jacket this can't be beat. Not only did the PreCip handle well in the rain but it provided the kind of breathability you would find in higher priced rain jackets. While it does skimp on the pockets it nonetheless provides a good contour fit around the upper torso. From the low profile zippers and tighteners this is a hiker, runner, or everyday man's must-have jacket. The jacket can be stuffed into one of its own pockets for stowage which makes it ideal for backpacking. I would highly recommend this jacket for anyone looking for a lightweight moderately priced rain jacket."
3,Through the eyes of an 18 yr old,"This book was not what I expected. The lessons learned from experience of life are missing. There were some interesting and encouraging aspects. For instance, taking a building that would be condemed these days, and making it into a home that was very functional and customized to fit their lifestyle. The quality that is strong throughout the book is the youthful,""I can do anything I set my mind to"" attitude that pretty much carried the author through tasks that would be daunting to many."
1,what a joke,This was the most stupid book i ever wasted my hard earned money on. I through it in the trash.
5,"Good job, Donna","I thought that this 2-CD set was an outstanding example of Donna Summer's talent. I like the songs ""On the Radio"" and ""She works hard for the money."" Great job, great dance music."
5,Great Anthology,"Yes, this covers pretty much all her hits. However, this Anthology is nearly a decade old if not longer. I still recommend it, though.When this set was released, there were songs that were never released to the public that are included in this set. However, since then, I'M A RAINBOW was finally released and fulfilled the longing need of Donna Summer fans for her early 80s material.It also includes her song CARRY ON which was released as a dance song that went to the top of the dance charts several years after this set was released."
1,racists will love it,"""Bell Curve"" of the decade... By the way, Colin Powell and Clarence Thomas are beneficiaries of affirmative action -- think about it."
4,Classic!,"One of the best type of one vs one bust a move or any bubble challenge games outthere... made me want to buy a new PS2 for this game, had to borrow a system from my friend. Good game!"
1,Disastrous,"I would have never predicted my favorite show on television, The Office, would have gone this sour, this fast. Its original main character, Michael Scott, played by Steve Carrel, has gotten married and moved away. Since the absence of Michael Scott, former salesman Andy Bernard, aka ""The Nard Dog"" has taken his place as the manager of the Scranton Branch for the paper company known as Sabre.All fans knew The Office would never be the same again without Michael Scott, but I was still optimistic. I thought, that even though the bread and butter of this successful series would soon be gone, there were enough hilarious supporting characters throughout to keep this show watchable, even if it could never be absolutely fantastic again. But boy, was I wrong. This show has become so unbearingly unwatchable, and unfunny that I almost want to mourn over the memories I had of what this show used to be. Season 8 is genuinely awful, there's no getting around it."
2,Jumped the shark,"This show has gotten much worse since Steve Carrel's character left the cast. I am so disappointed. I used to love it, and now I'm sort of ashamed of what it has become."
5,James Spader is a perennial MVP!,"While Steve Carrell is great, James Spader is sublime. In this trade, the Office upgraded.The shows that I most loved in the Office were the ones that not only made me laugh (all of them), but also those that were touching, especially the ones that explored the bond shared between Jim and Pam. In particular, Niagara 1 & 2. This first episode of season 8 brings that element back in full force. With pregnancy hormones raging, Pam is suddenly very sentimental, opening the door wide open for sweet moments.A great show just got better. A rare and welcome occurrence!"
4,I Love The Office: Season Eight,"The mood of the series changed after Michael Scott left, however the cast and the story carry on bringing laughs and levity. Andy does his best to rally the troops and brings a new sense of unity to the team."
1,Worhless.,"Don't even bother. Followed the instructions, the powder mixed into a blob with no adhesive value whatsoever. Wouldn't stick to the denture, wouldn't even stick to my finger. See your dentist or lab and get a real repair. Or don't. Just don't bother with Plate Weld or similar powder-based dental glues. I'm only giving it one star because the review won't accept zero stars."
2,bad information,"I haven't been through the whole book, just skimming it and reading parts that interest me. I'm not impressed. I've found bad information, such as ferrets needing only 30% protein, and needing a bath once a week. It also recommended hiding meds in cheese, yogurt, or ice cream. Sugar is a big no with ferrets, due to their risk of insolonoma. AND they are lactose intolerant! It also mentioned that breeding facilities tattoo the ferret's ear with two dots to indicated spay/neuter and descent. True, but ONLY for Marshall's. Canadian uses an 'I'.Oh, but the best mistake so far, and I quote, (pg 486) ""Typical rodents used for snake food include rabbits, rats, mice, gerbils, chickens, lizards, and other snakes."" !!!! What about a chicken is a typical rodent???!!!!"
5,Mellencamp Rolls On,"After the hard edge of Whenever We Wanted, Human Wheels find John Mellencamp again quieting things down. Though you could draw a comparison to Big Daddy, it would be through the softer nature of the album, not the lyrical content. The theme that runs through Human Wheels is about relationship and their growth. The title track is an instant classic. ""what If I Came Knocking"", ""When Jesus Left Birmingham"", ""Junior"" and ""Suzanne & The Jewels"" are all first rate John Mellencamp songs. Human Wheels finds John Mellencamp realizing that he is no longer a kid, but an adult and the songs are the most mature of his career."
5,in pursuit of a vanishing star: a novel,"this book is in super great condition, and i luv anything with Garbo involved. I got a great deal."
1,Even The King Can't Save This Mess,"I am a huge fan of Elvis's music and movies. Own them all on vhs and the DVD's as they've come out. That being said, Harum Scarum is THE WORST piece of trash ever captured on film. It's nearly criminal to watch one of the greatest talents in the history of mankind sleep walk through this pile of rubbish. The Presley estate should do Elvis and the rest of us a favor. Buy the master and burn it in a bonfire celebration at Graceland! (...)"
3,Quite quite average,"The only time Agatha Christie ever descends to the realm of ""average"" is when she writes a collection of short stories.This is no reflection on her ability to write them, it is simply ebcause of the fact that i personally do not like short stories, normally.the short stories here, compared with most, are actually quite good, i would suspect. Harley Quinn is a good character, but he sometimes annoys me. Far more entertaining is the brilliant Mr Satterthwaite (who we see again in the marvellous ""Three Act Tragedy"") who is one of Christie's great characters. He is calm, understated, interesting, clever. And very likeable.The characters in this collection are well drawn, and the concept of a mysteriious man such as Quinn appearing almost out of nowhere to guide Satterthwaite in the solving mysteries is a very original, mysterious one, which does work well.Overall, for a short story collection, this is very very good. but for a book by Agatha christie, it's rather average."
5,Useful items for any tech person,These enable you to remove the power 'bricks' from a power strip and fit more plugs into a given space. Quite useful . . . .
5,Better,"I bought this product because of all the outlets I waste on a my surge suppressors. It turned out to be more versatile than I expected. I leave it connected to whatever device power cords I have with extra large footprints. Where ever I move the space hogs they fit.5 POWER STRIP ADAPTERS LIBERATORS. They are also great for when my power cord is just 2 or 3"" inches shy of an outlet I want to reach."
2,It is not as advertized...,"Just received the package. Extensions are 10.5"" long including plugs, not 14"" as advertised. In addition the cable is 18AWG, not 16AWG. Don't see Ziotek name anywhere. Most likely it is a no name Chinese manufacturer. Irritated...don't like misleadings ads. This is not the first time Amazon provides such poor service to me. I just don't have any luck with them... And it seems like nobody cares."
2,Appears to do the job but not UL approved.,The major concern that I have with these extension cords is that they are NOT UL approved. I have a lingering doubt in my mind about hooking up my expensive equipment to non-approved cords (weakest link).
4,Great company to deal with!,"The sizing chart is not accurate at all. According to the chart I ordered my dad a small - we had to send it back and get a large - which was a bit too large but the medium was also too small.The hat looks great - the quality seems very niceThe company was extremely helpful, kind, and courtious as we worked through finding the closest fit.Don't use the hat sizes as a guide - take the time to measure your head and find what seems closest based on that."
4,It really flows like a good Sunday sermon -no time wasted,"This book helps you find you way historically and chronologically within the Bible, connecting Moses' out of Egypt experience and the settling on the Promised Land that goes on into Judges. In a very clear and fast paced language, precise exposition; not interested in deciphering possibilities for interpretation, but keeping right on the main track of the story. This is the history that God keeps pointing out to as a lesson, as clear as a Florida interstate highway."
3,"Good Debut, there some great songs. But is an OK album.","This is a great effort 4 Joe . He is capable of doing some good songs."" All or Nothing"", ""Everything"" and "" The One for Me"" are my favorites. There are some other good tracks but its a ""OK"" album. Still MY NAME IS JOE is his best album yet. If you really like old school funk R&B and you are a DIEHARD fan of Joe, its worth it."
4,Tommyknockers?,"Are you people really comparing Diderot to Steven King? Diderot is an author of historical significance who helped define enlightenment France. Steve King is a bubble gum horror author. I reccomend you drop the King, and pick up some Diderot."
4,Animorphs the Invion,This books is great. I think it could have been better though. it's sick when Jake eats a bug.
5,best toilet seat ever,i couldnt find the exact color toilet seat i had before with butterflies so i acquiesced and bought this one. I am so happy i did. Not only is it attractive but it very soft and pretty. I will purchase more of them as my other bathroom seats wear out.Now it is 3 years later and this seat looks brand new! so glad i bought it!
4,Finally Mary Magdalene recognized,"Having read Margaret George's Cleopatra, I was pleased to see that this book wasn't going to send me to the optometrist for stronger glasses. Cleo was tiny print and a whole lot of it. Mary, Called Magdalene was compelling & as a Catholic, I found it rewarding that the woman that I always felt got a bum rap from my church was fleshed out in such a glorious fashion. She was there when all the male disciples weren't. She played a very important role in Jesus' ministry. Combining fact & fiction, George makes Mary Magdalene come to life."
2,Sadly uninspired...,"If you were hoping for a juicy tale about the repentent sinner who washed Jesus's feet with her hair, you'll be disappointed by this dull story of poor put-upon Mary of Magdala. And if you want real spiritual insight, stick to the Bible--it's much more profound and to the point than the paint-by-the-numbers portrait here. Miss George did OK with human characters like Cleopatra and she's obviously trying really hard with Our Lord and His Disciples. But it takes more than mundane details and melodramatic dialog to capture the true essence of the Divine."
2,For true believers only,"Was Mary M. a prostitute? Apparently not, or at least not in this earnest, PG-rated version of her life. Ms. George spends most of her time trying to prove that Mary was not only a good girl but the best disciple Jesus ever had. The question is whether you care.If the answer is ""yes"", you might like this long rather boring book. Unfortunately, if you want to see the people of the Bible brought to life as believable human beings, you won't find that here, where everyone talks in sermons. There's too much preaching and not enough storytelling; the whole thing reads like a Sunday School lesson that goes on forever."
5,Super book!,Margaret George is one of my favorite novelists ever... a beautiful view from an alternate point... just lovely... I truly enjoyed this book! :)
5,I Loved it,"Excellent book..........The imagination of a Mary story, based on facts of the history of that era.........mixed in with Bible stories.Great book.......I loved it."
4,please note.,It does not say in the description product must be used up completely in 30 days. Otherwise product seem to work fine.
2,A Harvard Education Is A Terrible Thing To Waste,"Erich Segal once wrote that going to Harvard doesn't guarantee that you will be happy. Nor does a Harvard education guarantee that you will become a brilliant novelist. Case in point: The Student Body. Given the impressive biographies of the novel's four authors, I thought the book would be polished and well-written. Instead, I found it to be poorly plotted and poorly written. The characters, while comically rainbow coalition-esque, are fairly one-dimensional. The suspense scenes were predictable and not at all suspenseful. It was like a Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys mystery with sex, and boring sex at that. I wanted to really like this book because the marketing and press surrounding it have been so positive. But frankly, The Student Body was a huge, huge disappointment."
5,excellent sequel for reading aloud,"I wholeheartedly second the review by the Mother of Three from Oregon. This is a terrific sequel to the very enjoyable first book on the Mushroom Planet and the adventures of the two boys David and Chuck. In addition to the science, wonder, adventure, and drama, there's an interesting point to be made about pride. The anti-hero in this book is a pretentious, glory-seeking academic. I was able to tell my son that there are lots of this type in schools, academia, government, and the media, and that this type seeks not truth and beauty, but fame and self-glorification. We're looking forward to the next three in the series.Highly recommended."
1,How to do Nothing with...,"After reading nearly the entire book, I find that I now know how to navigate through the program and what to expect when I click a button. That's about the extent of my knowledge. The author's attempt to cover 'everything' about Access unfortunately results in a demonstration of what access' capabilities are and how to run a wizard. For instance, I know that 'criteria' can be used to filter information, but I do not have a very clear idea of what to actually put in the 'criteria' section in order to get what I want. As far as actually setting up a database complete with forms and reports - forget it. I can't even look at this book without getting angry."
2,Molded Laptop Sleve,"I purchased this sleeve to protect my Dell Latitude 14 inch, when received was very pleased. It protected my computer very nicely. But after using it only a few times (3 or 4) one of the teeth on the zipper broke. Now I can only zip one side up to the broken zipper and the other side to the broken zipper. I guess you get what you pay for."
4,ISO9001:2000For Small Businesses,"A concise guide to the new ISO9001:2000 detailed in the four pertinent sections that need to be addressed when setting up a quality system. A generous number of charts, outlines and guides are provided by the author. If I have any complaint it would be that there is almost too much information or that it seemed on first read that some of the information became redundant.Overall it is a great reference piece and very helpful."
2,Didn't work for me,"This player didn't work for me. I had problems playing longer movies. It seemed to get just past 1 hour of play then start hanging up. The picture would get ""blocky"", frames would be superimposed, and it would stop... then sometimes eject the disc. The discs would play without problems in my two year old computer DVD drive.Another annoyance.. the recommended file resolution for jpeg playback is 640x480. With this resolution it renders in perhpas 3 or 4 seconds. If you have files at 1500x1000 or so, it'll take more than 10 seconds to display."
4,Nice player for the price,"I bought this after returning a Philips DVD724AT that was defective. I'm very glad I made the switch as the JVC unit has more features and is built better. I had a non-progressive scan JVC DVD player for years before this that has always been very reliable.The only downside is the JPEG file viewing is so slow it's not worth bothering with. On the other hand, I didn't buy this unit for the JPEG feature anyway so I don't really mind."
4,Good for those who need something a little non-traditional...,I had to get this book for my Intro Physics class. It's a good book and it's great at getting the basic ideas across. It's not your average text-book by any means though. It's truly the same as reading a cartoon strip. The font is scribbly and there are characters sort of explaining everything along the way. It's a descent book and there actually are some funny moments.
2,Boring - at Best.,"Dr. Stark is not a very endearing character, and it is difficult to feel any sort of sympathy for this dreary man and his even more dreary existence. Therefore, when misfortune befalls him, I am cheered by it. He seems most deserving. Sorry, but this pathetic creature turned Braveheart at story's end is more than my fertile imagination can accept."
2,A Disappointment,"The main problem with this novel is that there are no sympathetic characters. You should be rooting for the protagonist, but he's portrayed from the start as weak and indecisive. I did not like him, so watching his life unravel was of no particular import. Since that was a key factor to the plot, that's a serious flaw.The book is at least 100 pages too long. Any suspense that might have been built was dispersed by unnecessary scenes and descriptions.Katzenbach should invest in a thesarus so he can find synonyms for ""wondrous."""
1,Awful Dialogue and Plot Development,"I am glad I checked this one out from the library. Awesome idea, with great potential. However, the characters are shallow and the plot development is laughable. I slogged through the first half, hoping it would pick up once the tables are turned and he's seeking revenge, but it only got worse. In the first half, the main character is pompous and dumb as a rock. In the second half, he's still dumb as a rock but suddenly everyone is reacting exactly as he expects (that phrase really gets repetitive in the book). Don't waste your time or money on this book."
3,Very Good Premise But an Only Okay Story!,"John Katzenbach has been one of my favorite authors -- his stories are always well-written and interesting from beginning to end. Hart's War and The Shadow Man and Just Cause are excellent examples of his work. In The Analyst, Katzenbach has come up with a premise equal to his best works. The basic idea can be summed up in this one line: ""happy fifty-third birthday, Doctor. Welcome to the first day of your death.... You ruined my life. And now I fully intend to ruin yours."" For the first third of the book, I couldn't put it down and the suspense kept mounting. However, while the second third and a good portion of the final third of the book gennerally maintained my interest, I found that it was easy to put down because the story became too drawn out and, at times, predictable. The conclusion was pretty clever but not too unexpected. Overall, The Analyst is a book worth reading but I'd take it from the library or wait for the paperback edition."
1,Not credible!,"The first part of the book was chilling, and there was an element of credibility about it. But the identity of the antagonist was pretty much apparent fairly early in the book. The second half of the book, however, was beyond belief. When the protagonists goes through twists and turns, opining where his antagonists would be, and then finding that they are exactly where he thought they were, over and over again, this was just not credible. The book was a disappointment, with little to do with even an imagined reality."
4,"Excellent Shirts, wish they were made in USA","I looked for chamois shirts made in USA, but couldn't afford them. Last year I bought them Woolrich chamois shirts, but they are enjoying these more, since they are a tad bit heavier."
5,Good Shirt,My husband really likes chamois shirts. He likes the heavier weight and rugged feel of the Guide Gear chamois shirts.
5,Thank goodness for Mike White & Laura Dern,"Mike White tends to write my life stories: The Good Girl, Orange County, Year of the Dog (especially), and now Enlightened (really nails it). He captures the people and stories most others in Hollywood miss entirely and delivers them with nuance and multi-layered truth, and ultimately compassion. There is no better choice than Laura Dern to play the lead here. Also a favorite of mine since forever, she personally has similar understandings of humanity and life as White. I am so happy there is a place in the ""tv/cable-sphere"" for this type of special show."
1,"love these actors, not this show","i am a fan of shows like 'Breaking Bad', 'Justified', 'Mad Men', 'Hell on Wheels', et al...and this show was recommended to me by someone who has similar taste in shows. I like Laura Dern and Luke Wilson, but for whatever reason, I do not love these characters. I'm never rooting for them. Mike White is a great writer (School of Rock), and he's ok in this show, but it just doesn't work for me."
1,Not cool,"Doll is not as nice as photos. At the store, her hair is matted and the makeup is too dark. The outfit is cheap looking. They really could have made a great doll, but goofed."
5,Dispensationalism,To read this book is a must for any christian interested in theology whether you finally agree with Ryrie or not. It is also an invaluable reference. John Conover
5,First Aid for post acrylic nails!,This is the daddy of all nail therapy cremes. Having had gel nails for six months I could not believe how my nails had turned into biscuit wafers! This creme works quickly and has a lovely light scent. A good investment.
4,Great product - HUNTER please lower the cost!,"I'm extremely happy with the performance of my 6 year old QuietFlo. The filters work great, but it KILLS me to spend $80+/year in replacement filters/pre-filters. Bottom line: replacement filters cost WAY TO MUCH no matter what the brand! I think if one company would start selling replacement filters at reasonable prices -all companies would follow."
5,Why aren't these guys playing stadiums?!,"With this collection Redd Kross proves once again that they are the most overlooked/under-rated band on the scene today and it's a DAMN SHAME!""Phase Shifter"" contains infectious hooks combined with the kind of sensible power pop that ordinarily would sell millions. Unfortunately for all the talent contained within these grooves, Redd Kross goes virtually unnoticed by mass pop marketeers.In short if you love ""Power Pop"" with an edge, you owe it to yourself to give this CD more than one spin. It is nothing less than a masterpiece of heart felt pop craftmenship."
3,Slow delivery by amazon,I would not know how good this product is because I am still waiting for it to delivered! Amazon is so slow and communication from them never happens. I am seriously considering never purchasing any more items from them again. I need this book for a lesson that is being taught to kindergarteners this week and it looks like it will not get here in time. Thanks for nothing!
3,"Since they suck right after Joshua Tree, it's not that bad..","It's a decent album with few songs I like, ""babyface."" But overall, it definately SUCK big time compare to their early albums (it's a compliment, their pre-joshua tree albums are BEYOND GREAT) like The Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby, October. I guess they are getting old and lost the creativity....what a shame to the rock&roll legends."
4,Numb,"Not a bad record, certainly far better than Pop. Numb is the best track, by far. The rest are mid-tier U2 fodder. Unlike Actung Baby, this CD now sounds dated. Probably for big U2 fans only."
1,The worst U2 album of all,This is certianly the worst of all the U2 albums. Hard to believe that the same U2 produced greats like Achtung Baby and Joshua Tree. If you are new to U2 then this is the album to avoid.
1,Zoo sad!,"Easily the worst piece of work U2 have ever done. Even if you're a big fan of this group, I wouldn't recommend this cd. This just proves that big stars like U2 can make horrible records. I regret buying this album. Sad to say."
1,What a let-down,"After Achtung Baby. As a longtime U2 fan, I v bought this CD when it came out figuring it would grow on me. It never did.Bono must have lost his incredible lyrical ability jsut before this album, becuase everything he has written since has been utter crap. It's really amazing, how he went from One to this empty shell.I suggest to any fans who have Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby that you go backwards in building your collection."
2,Definitely not their best,"This is definitely not U2's best album. This was recorded in a matter of a few weeks, and it shows. Only a couple songs: the title track, ""Daddy's Gonna Pay for your Crashed Car"" and ""Babyface"" can be classified as good -- ""Daddy's..."" being the only one out of those that can be called excellent. The rest of the songs are pretty mediocre.U2 displays here that they are at their best when they take their time in the studio and make us wait awhile before their next album. Their next two albums, Pop and All You Can Leave Behind are much better, and both were about four years apart in time from each other and Pop released nearly four years after this album. U2 should stick to that formula; it works better for them."
4,Not to be ignored,"Apparently, when they wrote 'The Wanderer' they all agreed it sounded like a Johnny Cash song- so what else was there to do but get the old goat to sing it! Very fine it is aswell.'Zooropa' and 'Pop' made me a U2 fan. They encompass everything that a band of their 'profile' should be aiming for: trying to mess with their audience as much, and as often as possible. Few bands of their stature have really tried it and the fact that the sales declined while doing so is a great testamant to a job well done. 'Mofo', 'Mother', 'Lemon': top stuff.Nice one fellows!"
5,U2's best album,"For a band that has done as much as U2, rating the best of the best is difficult, but if I had to take only one or their albums with me as I left earth for ever, this would be it. It's strange and subtle, yet familiar and complex at the same time. I have listened to it hundreds of times and I am still finding things that I missed. A dreamy, visionary piece of work. I think I'll put it on right now."
1,WORTHLESS,"Installed gauge with little difficulty. Sending unit defective. B&M sent new sending unit, needle sticks on gauge. B&M--when I finally got to speak to someone--said Amazon sold me a defective gauge, and offered no further assistance. I'm past the 30-day return period, so am out lots of time and 60 bucks. B&M used to have a solid reputation. However, I would advise anyone other than a masochist to avoid buying this product."
3,Review of Riding My first Pony CD,"This is a great CD of 11 songs for children - ages 4-6yrs.; but children of all ages would enjoy it also. The great medley of songs touches on all kinds of thoughts, fears and wishes of children in everyday life, sung to catchy upbeat melodies."
2,History with an agenda,"Williams' history of God's redemptive acts would be good reading if he just stayed with the Bible story as it presents itself. Instead, he starts with Jesus' resurrection, then moves to the exodus from Egypt, and then finally goes to the beginning in Genesis. Of course, there are reasons for preparing us for Genesis, but it seems like he jumps around too much. At the end of the book he builds a strange theory of mostly-physical bodily resurrection, using Jesus' resurrection (before His ascension to a *glorified* body) as the springboard. That's why he begins at the resurrection of Christ rather than at creation. This causes the need for lots of flash-backs and flash-forwards, making the book much more confusing than a history of redemption ought to be."
3,Not the best album,"The album wasn't the best album of the scorps. It's lyrics were really harsh. There are still some good songs in there like Under the Same Sun, and No pain No gain, but the others had really harsh lyrics in them."
1,sophomoric,"Actually to call this book sophomoric is to insult high school sophmores. I did finish it, afterall I had hope and it cost me $25. But it never got better. I love the game of tennis and I know the game. In this book there were no revelations or insights one couldn't find in a decent tennis periodical.This book was an insult to the game of tennis and an embarrassment to poor hapless Spadea and the shameless Markowitz. I wouldn't take the time to reveiw this book, but these guys shouldn't be allowed to profit from such drivel... don't encourage, don't buy!"
5,I loved Jay's book!,"Jason writes a story that will captivate the reader. It is very emotional, and it has its ups and downs, but at the same time is quite comical. If you are Maltese, or come from a close- knitted family, it will be especially funny to you!"
1,Almost nothing here,"I was hoping to get a yoga dvd for ""the rest of us"" which would actually introduce me to the yoga postures; only slowly, with props- so I could eventually do the poses without help. I want an actual yoga workout, with real yoga poses, done slowly and explained well. But Cappy's routine is fast, much too elementary and doesn't carefully explain the poses before entering into them. There were four actual yoga poses (all rushed through) included in the routine; plus the sun salutation - which is done much too quickly for beginners and the elderly. The rest of the dvd is Cappy promoting yoga and herself. I was very disappointed and won't purchase any more of her dvd's."
5,Great Tape!,I do it every day and have ordered one for my neighber too. She is great in explaining the moves. Working on the balance ones as I didn't know my balance was not good. Great Tape!!!
3,Yoga for the Rest of Us,"The salutation to the sun was way too difficult. I found the rest good, but not broken down so that I could go to the relaxation at the end of the sun movements without doing a fast forward. Would be better if you could go to a title of each."
2,yoga,"i thought it was a DVD,but it was a cassette (my mistake) anyway it was a very,very short cassette"
4,Very good for beginners,I wanted wsomething to help with balance and keep me flexible and I think this will do the trick.
4,They Were Single Too,This book is being used by our women's class at church as a study guide. I have received good reports from the class members about the book.
4,Best Dictionary for Basic Terms,"This is for researchers who have modest training in statistics but have to use it or read it. Coverage is limited to lower-division stuff. Advanced mathematical statistics is completely left out. The definitions are thorough and clear and there are many figures that do a good job of illustrating the concepts. For the intended audience, I think this is the best statistics dictionary. Vogt's Dictionary of Statistics and Methodology 2/e targets the same audience, but Sahai & Khurshid have done a much better job. I left off one star just because, if they had not restricted the coverage so much, this fine dictionary would have been useful to a lot more people."
5,Good player,"This is a great DVD player. It has everything you need, at a price you can't beat. It's such a good buy. It's easy to set up and easy to use. A great first DVD player for anyone who is thinking of getting a DVD player. I wouldn't use it on my HDTV home theater, but if you just want something simple that looks great, this is the one. It has good sound and picture for the price. Haven't had any problems with it, what can I say I love it. It was cool.Big Truck"
4,Cheap. 1-minute setup. Easy.,"I purchased two handsets from DigitalEtc at $5.99 each, which I couldn't believe. But they arrived in perfect new condition. These are nearly identical to the original handsets. However, the original ones let me retrieve messages from the base answering system. These extension models do not."
1,What a waste,"Be wary. Our expandable set of these phones worked fine, generally, for several months. The reception was ""tinny"", but not so much that we had a real problem with it. However, the echo got worse and worse, until we could no longer hear or be heard. After trying a different phone cord and trying the phone in a neighbor's house to see if we could identify the problem, we determined the phones are simply trash. More electronics in the landfills, alas. Phones should last many, many years, not many, many weeks."
2,In Defense of the Editor...,"I happen to be aquainted with the author and in defense of this much respected author, I must let the readers know that this was not a finished work when published. The project was poorly handled by the publisher, and was printed from a rough draft. Modern writers, beware with whom you enter into pacts..."
3,bamboo book,"Surveys only some of the better rodmakers - Brackett, Jennings, Jenkins and others - and describes test casting and action of each...Observations were interesting, but not much of a reference. This is not an updated reference book a la Marty Keane (which is thin also) but more of a musing through rodbuilding, action etc. The rodbuilding/collecting/fishing community is lacking a comprehensive reference of fine contemporary cane rods. This book helps but does not go far enough. Pictures are desired in this type of book but sadly are missing. Many of the chapters appeared in a small fly fishing journal out of Livingston in the past so you may have seen them before. And a piece by John Gierach, surprise, suprise."
5,Brilliant book,"This is a brilliant, scholarly analysis of Teresa's rhetorical strategies. Scholars in women's studies, literature, and religious history will find it insightful and stimulating. By the way, I'm a Boston mom but also a university professor."
1,Never Worked!,"The only thing gained from this toy is child and parental fruatration. Film doesn't advance, flash doesn't work..."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"Cute camera...however it does NOT work. I should have known from start when putting the film in to operating it, nothing was easy. Used the 12 exposure film that came with it and also used a 24 exposure on Christmas Day. Only a hand full of pictures turned out, the rest were double exposures and blanks. I don't think the film advanced right. Santa will be replacing this one."
1,"Great idea, bad execution","My son loves to take photos, so I bought this ""sturdy & fun"" camera for him. We were quickly disappointed by the performance of the camera--it flashes erratically, even with new batteries, plus the film mechanism is faulty--it tore apart the film when we rewound it. We began with excitement for the camera, but it quickly turned to disappointment."
5,still going.....,"I bought this for my three year old daughter THIRTEEN years ago. Easy to use. Beautiful photographs. And STILL IN USE many children later. It has been dropped down stairs, left in the rain, and generally coped with the rugged years of use by four children."
5,Great CD,I bought this cd for my mom as a gift but I've enjoyed it too. I'm 29 years old - I think this cd would appeal to all age groups.
3,Okay,"For me this ring is just okay. One of the things that I didn't like is that the two-tone gold part of the ring is so light it barely looks two tone. Plus the finishing of the vermeil looks cheap to me. The sparkle of the stones is very good, but I'll be returning the ring."
4,Best of Black Uhuru,Great Black Uhuru CD. This has all the favorites hits from Black Uhuru. Easy reggae.
2,Shallow,"I keep looking for books about the history of Arabs giving a pure academic point of view, unfortunately without success. This book certainely doesnot go deep intothe history of Arabia, nor of the origins of its people or the origins of people who migrated out of Arabia.It is a big dissapointment."
5,Character Development at its Finest,"If you are looking for a plot driven story, then this may not satisfy. However, if you do not approach the story with the same kind of expectations you might bring to a work of popular fiction, Farrell maintains a high level of interest. I believe Studs Lonigan is one of the most developed characters in twentieth century American fiction. I am especially impressed that this depiction comes across so strongly without the aid of contrived catastrophes that land on the character from out of the blue. Although Studs is affected by his environment, it is still possible to trace the turns his life takes to sources within his own personality. These sources determine him as often as they are determined by him. I found him to be neither beneath nor above me. I can't say the book is exciting so much as extremely moving. Either way, I was turning the pages late into the night.Definately a book I will remember all my life."
5,AWESOME CD,"I love this Cd was a gift to myself.I have been looking for a good Juan Gabriel CD,I found it.Price was good."
2,Good film let down by poor video and audio,"With Angela Mao as elegantly choreographed as ever, and a decent, even gripping, plot, why give this only 2 stars? Poor video quality, and awful dubbing, that's why. Like all these movies, it comes across much more effectively in the Chinese version with subtitles."
1,Not nice,"Fits like a sack, styled like something my mother might have worn - very late in life. Not nice at all. I DON'T wear tiny underwear, but there's enough fabric in these for two pair, going on three. Yuck."
5,Get the funk out!,Only once in about 50 years does funk of this caliber come around to tickle the collective fancies of a new generation. This is funk that sticks to your ribs like doodie on the wall. This is funk that cuts through your soul like Jack the Ripper. And it is a crime against humanity that this seminal band from Milwaukee has not yet acheived East Coast representation. That's all for now...Anthony Olson is God!
3,Not really what I expected...,"Be aware that this maze book is about the size of a large index card. (Approx. 4.5"" by 6"") I was expecting a regular-sized book since I didn't see any other description and instead got this tiny little thing that could literally fit into my pocket. Mazes are pretty good, so that's all right; although they're not in color, which was a little disappointing. But just wanted to let people know about it's size!"
3,Shorter than the others,"I love these little Dover books. I carry them in my purse and they are very handy in a restaurant or waiting room. They are also perfect for adding a little bit of cost to my orders to get free shipping. For some reason, though, this particular book is shorter than the others...only about 30 pages, whereas the other books are about 50 pages. From now on, I'll look at the page count before ordering."
4,great for restaurants,"I keep these great little books in one of those little bags you buy shower curtains or pillow cases in with a few crayons and a small toy. Makes a great restaurant pack for the kids and fits in most of my large purses. I like that the kids can color the pictures too. I didn't realize they were small books when I bought them, but it turned out to be a nice surprise"
4,Well........,"This is a very fun game but it is the almost least played game in my collection with # 1 being Star Wars Rebal Strike. The reason why that is, is because I had almost all of the Sonic Genesis Games and because when you have all the new generation games most people are going to play those....I am not saying old games stink, I am a HUGE Sonic Fan. The fact that is the only thing I asked for my birthday was Sonic Stuff and I bought this by selling my broken PS2 and all of the games I got three games this was one and I still do play it but I have SA2B, SADX & SSBM to keep my time and yet this still has a BIG place in my heart."
2,Punk rockabilly,Good songs --fast and loud-- but a poor live recording. Muddy vocals. 'Tis a shame it wasn't recorded better because it probably was a dynamite show.
2,"Cute shapes, difficult to remove ice","Shapes are a neat idea, but removing the ice from the trays can be challenging. The soft rubber seems to hold onto the ice."
5,Abbey Road,"Ladies and Gentleman: I will debate with anyone who attempts to disprove The BEATLES as being less than the greatest rock band of all time. Abbey Road only provides more evidence to my claim. With the ""end of the road"" already insight, The BEATLES dug deep and produced one of the best gems ever. From John Lennon's political statement Come Together to Paul McCartney's ballad at the end of the album gives airtight evidence of The BEATLES brilliance."
5,Amazing Sound,"Everybody already knows what a great record this is, so this review is about the audio/pressing quality. I've heard some rumblings about pressing issues in some of these vinyl remasters. I can only speak for myself and say that I have various other copies of Abbey Road on vinyl including an original pressing, but this is the finest example of Beatles audio quality on vinyl that I myself have had the pleasure of hearing. Yes, it sounds that good."
4,Abbey Road,"This album-Abbey Road-has a lot of good songs on it like ""Octopus' Garden"", ""Maxwell's Siler Hammer"" and many more. The songs on this record are up-beat and fun so if you listen to it a few times you'll know all the words. Then you'll be singing along with one of the '60-'70's greatest bands.In my opinion,wow! Good album! The songs are great and so is the band, what else do you need?I reccommend this album to any one who likes rock/pop music. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, andStar did a good job! Listen and enjoy!"
2,OK,"This album is OK, but is also a reminder that 1963's cohesive band had by 1969 become a collection of individuals who wrote their own songs and got together to back each other up in the recording studio. The album tracks fall into four separate and identifiable categories - the incredible work by George who saves the album with 2 tracks, John's songs, Paul's songs, and the unfinished songs that were simply spliced together. Not one of my favorite albums, but worth it because of ""Here Comes the Sun""."
3,Abbey Road,"""Octopuses Garden is great. It's a nice and happy song."" Give us all a break.Led Zeppelin was releasing ground breaking music at the time this was done. The Beatles had really fallen somewhat behind. I'm counting on the new release of ""Let It Be"" to be a return to the great music that the band had to offer.Abbey Road has some redeeming qualities, but Octopuses Garden detracts rather than adds to this album."
5,The Best Album Of All Time.,"They were the masters of their time, and still remain the kings, even today. If you don't believe my title and rating, ""Come Together"" and listen to Side B of Abbey Road."
1,Abbey Road? More like Abbeystupid Road,"I heard the Beatles album ""Rubber Soul"", the one with their one hit ""Norwegian Wood"". That song was good and the other filler songs were...eh...(flipping my hand around like to say ""ehhhh"", you know?)...I always saw these guys as a one hit wonder. But someone said, ""You gotta hear 'Abbey Road' by them."" And, I was like. Okay. Apparently this band was an influence for great bands like Herman's Hermits and New Order and stuff, so, I thought, okay...if I can find it, i'""ll chekc it out. I found it. Checked it out. Uh...Ever heard of a word called ""Porduction"", lads? They...I don't know when one song ends and the other stops. They have different lead singers for every song. The songs have no thru line or melody to speak of. I see here that some people gave this thing 5 stars. Hello! What? There's a reason you never hear of these guys any more. They're probably all living in a shack trying to live on their little checks for ""Norwegian"" Wood."
4,Abbey Road a MUST for any Beatles fan,"This was one of the last albums the Beatles cut. It is the Beatles at their most evolved. This album is a great showcase of musical diversity. The only other Beatles albums that can compare to this are Rubber Soul & Sgt. Peppers. (I'm not one of the majority that think the White Album is their best) This one is not a dust collector! If you look at the track list, you won't recognize the songs by name. But when you play the CD, you'll know just about every song on the album."
5,Great!,"When I listen to this C-D, i do not here one bad song. It is one of the best C-D's i have ever heard."
5,The Everest of Popular Music,"Abbey Road is the best album ever made. Why? Look first at the circumstances of its recording. The Beatles had all but agreed to end it after the ""Get Back-Let it Be"" fiasco. Inner turmoil and natural growth had led them to this point in their career. The story goes they phoned George Martin and said 'let's do one more like we used to'. And so they did.The instrumentation is seamless and breathtaking at points. The songs are timeless. The End suite of songs is not only powerful, but unique in recorded music. They did this in one take - unbelievable. The music on this album will be just as fresh in 2069 as it was in 1969.I've heard the working title for Abbey Road was Everest, after a favorite brand of cigarettes. Very appropriate, I think. No higher mount has been scaled in popular music to this day. This is where the progress of popular music's growth ended. What a journey, from Johnny and the Moondogs to the top of the world."
5,"A MUSICAL JOURNEY, A CELEBRATED MASTERPIECE","""Abbey Road"" is the quintessential Beatles album an album that rocks, roars, croons and shimmers. ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" is a lesson in the use of noise and beautiful writing and ""Bathroom Window>Golden Slumbers>Carry That Weight>The End"" is the most superb soudning song of any era. A classic CD with a mysterious cover that shows you just how crafty the Fab Four really were."
5,Album Of The Century?,"While it famous as Beatles' true last album, this one needs no such tag to recommend it. Its a classic. The Dark Horse George Harrison puts out two of his best songs here. He also leaves out the Sitar, Saarang and tablas to give the album a conventional feel. The lyrics are fascinating and mysterious. Can't mention any song though.. all of them are excellent. I've been listening to this album for the last 14 years and still haven't tired of it. Now thats a good investment!"
2,Sound Engineers!!??????????,"Upon reading a lot of negativity, I was skeptical, because we have to be negative first, this is what get's the pot stirring..... .Aside from having 4,5,6 of the Beatles various pressings, I, a Beatles ""lifer"" couldn't resist the temptation to lose/drop $$$ on four lp's so far, Abbey Road, Magical Mystery Tour, Pepper's, and The White album. MMT is super on my Shure V15-III loud clear vibrant etc. Abbey Road played as back round was ok.... later played under ""louder"" conditions, the background noise almost drowned out the music.... , no fuzz on the needle!!! Two cleanings later and this record sounds as if it has been played 4,000 times,,,ARE THEY SERIOUS, No this is not just my copy, you can see for yourself!!!! I'm afraid to open the other two........"
5,Truly excelent,"I have always admired how the Beatles felt a need to be different than other bands of the time. How they got sick of the same old and went with something new. This album includes some of my favorite songs, the kind that you find yourself singing inside your head for weeks. Everything from Octopus's Garden to Here Comes The Sun. The album is a pleasant mixure of songs displaying each band member's personality. I highly recommend this ablum."
5,Lived it - Love it!,"Obviously, the ""Swan Song"" critical review is not old enough to have appreciated this album and the Beatles' progression of music. 30 years later, and this is still excellent! A real classic and timeless."
2,The remastered mix sux. UGH!,"I was musically aware when the beatles emerged, and I became musically knowledgable during their long musical dominance.I KNOW how Abbey Road is supposed to sound and I can't believe everyone is giving this crap a pass. The remastering favors the bass to the detriment of the entire experience. The original sound had a wonderful balance of bass, voice, rhythm.This mix suxI bought this to replace my lost CD, and decided to pay extra bucks and go for what these clowns consider an excellent mix.I'm going back and buying the older version.How long are these remasters going to continue being horrifically botched versions of imbalance.I'm giving 2 stars because after all, this IS the Beatles.Don't record producers know that George Martin LIVES and might still be available for consultation???"
5,AMAZING,It sounds amazing very clear and its a must have for every Beatles lover. I love it and i listen to it in the car constantly
4,This was a gift,I have no issue with this order. As far as I know everything is good. My daughter has a turntable and wanted some records.
5,My favorite Beatles album.,Nothing much to add here that hasn't already been said. This is my favorite Beatles album and truly a 5/5.
5,Superb!,By far one of my favorite ways of listening to music is a vinyl or an old tube radio. Abbey Road is great album and sounds terrific! Great sounds and will be a favorite vinyl in my collection!
3,Great Album But Not Much Better Than 1987 Release,"I am a huge Beatles fan but this release is nothing special, I did an A-B test with the 1987 release and the only difference I can tell is they boosted the bass. The video accessed on any computer is located in the Data folder and is in MOV format so you need Quicktime to view it, I was disappointed that the video wasn't longer and more in depth. I also prefer jewel cases to digipak, jewel cases work better in my CD rack and if it breaks I can buy a new one.To sum up: if you have the 1987 release then don't bother with the remaster."
1,Seller is spamming me!,"I bought this product almost a year ago. Now, suddenly, the seller has harvested my trusted-accounts-only email address from the transaction and started sending me spam that they claim I have ""signed up for"". Worse yet, they are evidently doing it through an offshore spam factory, and so it seems likely that my absolutely-spam-free email account has been destroyed by this abuse of theirs.I recommend that you do not do business with this supplier, in my experience they cannot be trusted!"
5,Basic stuff but I like it,Not much to tell - I am occasionally using this stuff for 15 years.I do like the aftershave more than I care about fragrance.At $35 it's likely my year supply.
4,Pretty Interesting,"I am taking multiple international economy classes right now and I find them interesting so I watched this documentary. i found it very interesting. I agree with its assertions for the most part. I talked with my professors about this documentary and they said the guys from Chicago are looney and are infamous for it. I can't say, but the documentary does seem to provide ample evidence of that imo. I wish some of the experiments were presented differently. I wish it was a little more in depth. But, I have been talking with my buddies about this for a couple of weeks and if I trust a documentary enough to bring it up with friends, it deserves a 4.5 star for me. (P.S. The guy who said this is like the Koch brothers is trolling. I am a independent and in journalism school along with econ, so I think a lot about bias, and after watching the documentary, i felt like it had more of a left leaning bias, but not too great of one to be a problem.)"
2,Complete and total disaster,"This is not the the best CD from Patrulha do Samba. I loved the other one. It had one of my favourite songs of all time ""Rala no pezi"". Anyway, this one is horrible...almost painful. I would not recommend it at all."
3,"Its fun, but not that fun","This game does have great graphics. It is fun to fly around in the path it gives you and shoot things, but it gets boring. And the game is WAY too hard. The bosses dont die, you have to shoot them millions and billioms of times to get them to die. Big dissapointment. But it was still good. Good story and as i said great graphics. Also way way way too short man. If it wasnt so hard you could beat it in and hour."
3,"Good, not great","I dug this CD a lot more back when it was originally released. Listening to it now, it seems a bit dated. The band roars, no question, there are quite a few heavy-ass riffs going on here. But the gangsta posing comes off as laughable now, it's like he tries to squeeze every street hoodie cliche imaginable into every lyric. That crap seemed cool in the early 90's but sure sounds silly now. Definitely worth picking up if the RATM style fusion floats your boat & you have no problem looking past the dated imagery."
4,the birth of 2 gods,"Its a shame that most Mobb Deep fans dont even know this album exsists. back in '93, this album contained 4 of the most played underground hits in hip hop. when i listen to this album now, it amazes me to realize that P and Havoc were only 17 at the time. Anyone who is familiar with the album knows what i'm talkin about. I first heard ""hit it from the back"" on Sretch and Bobbito""(which i taped every week from '91 through 96) I knew that these kids had what it it takes to make it to the top of the rap world,which they achieved in '95. Shook ones Pt.1 and 2 still remain on the top of my list as ALL time rap songs ever. Sadly,I must admit that they have fallen to the commercial scene that hip-hop is today. My only question is.... Do they like their underground roots more than they love their new(commercial) found fortune? By the record sales, the public has already decided."
4,Early Franti - 1992 release,"I had owned Spare Ass Annie for years, and since these guys were the core back up for Uncle Bill, when I saw this disk, I had to check it out. Cerebral, topical rap lyrics with some interesting instrumentation here and there. If you like Michael, rap and thinking, this is for you."
5,An invaluable Caribbean travel guide for avid divers,"Informatively written by veteran diver and journalist Bob Burgess, Diving Off The Beaten Track is an engaging travelogue showcasing superb diving locations in the Bahamas, the Caymans, Belize, and Bay Islands. Full-color photographs wonderfully enhanced Burgess' engaging narration making Diving Off The Beaten Track superbly fascinating reading for armchair travelers as well as an invaluable Caribbean travel planning guide for avid divers."
5,Read-aloud to your children or grandchildren,"This is a good book to read aloud to young children. It is a good story with a happy ending. The pictures are large and colorful. Children will enjoy it if you change your voice when reading the parts of the different animals. Runaway Bunny, by the same author, is more well-known, but I like this one better."
4,Berlin 1945,"considering the space limitations that are imposed on opsprey's campaign series, the book does a very good job of describing the battle and offers excellent illustrations."
5,The Sweet Mexican singer,Aida Cuevas is one of the most sweet mexican singer and this album contein some of her best songs.
3,The Iguanas...Superball,"Good music from a great bar band. Saw them live last year in Virginia and though they were tired, they put on a great show. If you ever see their first CD out there...BUY IT! It is a perfect CD. Every song is a charm and they easily move from lovely south of the border melodies and rhythms to Texas twang. I think though that the quality of material has prgressively dropped off with each new CD. What are we up to now? 4? Sugartown I thought was dissapointing considering the heat on the that first one."
4,The real deal.,"After the somehow contrived'Adrenalize'album(1992),the Leps reached into the sack and came up with an excellent collection of electric and acoustic tunes that reassured those who thought that their brilliant career ended with'Hysteria'.After listening to this little gem,two things are clear:not only they can rock out but they also have a sense of depth and mood as their early albums testify.It's two steps behind..."
4,Pretty good run through of Lep's B-sides,"I am not a huge fan of this album. It's great to hear the B-sides, but this album was released around the time that every other band on the planet was releasing or re-releasing greatest hits or B-sides albums, and this one got lost in the fold. I do love the acoustic ""Two Steps Behind,"" though. The other songs are pretty good too, but I don't think that this one is an essential Leppard album. Still though, it is worth looking into if you are a fan."
5,An Excellent Collection of Unreleasd Songs,"Retro-Active was is an excellent collection of covers and unreleased songs. Although this album was origionally meant to be a collection for their fans, it had two hit singles, ""Two Steps Behind"" and ""Miss You In A Heart Beat"". What I like most of this album is that the band shows of their excellent technique and the ability to do a variety of music. This album is also the only album that has both Steve Clark and Vivian Cambell."
1,If you like to be annoyed this is for you,To me deadguy sounds like a little kids running around screaming and banging pots and pans together. A band of monkeys with jugs sounds better than deadguy. My advice is to stay far away from this album.
4,This book was a quality distraction from daily life.,I enjoyed this book. It mixed many historical era's and kept you reading at a steady pace. I thought it started out strong and had some interesting conflicts. I was a little let down at the end that seemed too easy to me. Overall I enjoyed it.
2,I realy dont know what this book suppose to say.,"I read other books of zelazny like the amber series and other books, I loved them generaly, but I just dont know what is this book. I read and read, wait for some thing, but nothing. My brother loved it but I dont"
4,Darn good for a year old game.,"Having enjoyed Ghost Recon on the PC, I figured I'd pick it up with my XBox Live kit. It's still a very solid and enjoyable title. The graphics are of course a bit dated, and many online games lag due to hosts having low upload speeds, but overall I think this is the best Live title out right now. If you have an upload speed of 256kbps or greater, please do us all a favor and host games. I have read many reviews complaining that this game will not work on an old XBox, but I've had mine since launch day and I have no problems whatsoever. There has also been mass confusion about the voice communication feature. This is due to people being too lazy to read the instruction manual. You have to hold down the white button to talk, just like a real radio. I always announce this in games I host, because there are just so many people out there that won't spend five minutes learning the controls. Now you know."
5,MONEY WELL SPENT,"Game is not run and gun, need to use battlefield tactics. 50, yes 50 missions, took me about 30 min each for first two missions so far, maybe that is a long time, but i did not lose any men...Excellent game."
3,"Decent, but not great.","Over all, it was a decent game.Cons:1. You can not climb over low wall, I mean LOW walls, logs, molehills, ridges in the road. Ok, I exaggerate a little here, but not much. No low wall over foh JOOO! 1 yr.2. Forget the 3-5 second rush to move from cover to cover. No running.3. Only able to go up or down the lowest inclines. This causes you to get ""hung"" on what LOOKS like little hills,.4. Can be quite difficult to even spot the enemy. Thank goodness your squad members can spot them.Pros:1. Love the way you can set your team up with weapons and all.2. Low crawl, crouch, or hunch over.3. Fairly realistic. Every bullet can count.4. Waypoints, map, all that is really nice.If you are looking for fast paced fun action though, and don't need/have Xbox Live, go for Halo!"
3,HAVING TROUBLE LOVING THIS GAME,GHOST RECON IS KINDA LIKE HALO IN A SENSE WHEN YOUR HUNTING DOWN THE ENEMY BUT MY PROBLEM IS WHRN U FINNALLY FIND SOMEONE SHOTS COME OUT OF NOWHERE AND BEFORE U CAN HANDLE THE SITUATION YOUR TEAM IS DEAD NOW THAT WAS MY PROBLEM AND I DIDNT CARE FOR FIRST PERSON SHOOTING EITHER .BUT IF U LIKE ARMY SHOOTING GAMES THISIS THE GAME THE GRAPHICS ARE GREAT AND THE SOUND IS AWESOME BUT BE PREPARED TO GET MAD WHEN YUOR GETTING AMBUSHED AND CANT DO NOTHING ABOUT IT THATS REALLY MY ONLY DISLIKE IN THE GAME .ITS NOSPLINTER CELL BUT ALL IN ALL ANOTHER GOOD CLANCY GAME.BRIAN
3,"Good concept, bad graphics","Although this game offers plenty of items to unlock (weapons, levels, etc.), the graphics of the surrounding environments are horrible. Cars and buses on the streets are terrible, bullets don't break the glass.The sounds in this game stink too. Maybe this was a game of the year title, but this isn't 1987.You want a great Tom Clancy game with excellent graphics and interactive surroundings, buy Splinter Cell. ....."
4,Excellent tactical military FPS,Mirrors Rainbow Six 3 in many ways...good graphics. Love the way the enemy uses his rifle to hobble away when you shoot him in the leg. Many of the same tactics are still used today in Advanced Warfighter...
1,Punk Rock,"You know what? I dont dig punk rock, but I do respect it. I would rather people listen to this then Brittney Spears. So...I cant really talk to bad about this CD, because its not my genre."
4,Helpful on the job,"This book is very helpful on the job, figuring out construction terms English vs.Spanish. Not comprehensive, but it's charm is it is a pocket size, so it's really at hand when needed. Also, for those with little Spanish, it has enough common words that sometimes the English speaker can find help for the words that need to go with the construction term. I work with construction teams of volunteers in Spanish speaking areas, and I recommend all such teams have a copy of this book.--Tom Mitchell"
3,For the hardcore fans,"There are other books which deal with this subject and, I suspect, they're probably better (more comprehensive, better researched) than this one. But you have to give credit where it due: this was the first book that covered the arduously long process that it took to bring GWTW to the screen. It's a wonder the damned thing got made at all, let alone turn out to be the cinematic triumph it (still) is. And so the story of how it all happened is endless interesting, but perhaps mainly for the more hardcore GWTW fan. If you only want to read one book on the making of GWTW, this one probably shouldn't be it. But if you can't get enough of this stuff, it's one to add to your library."
5,Refreshing a Classic Devotion,"For those of us who are devoted to Our Lady and habitually say the Rosary, Fr. Gabriel Harty breathes new life into our prayer by reminding us of many things we already know and casting them in a new light. For readers who are only beginning to pray the Rosary, The Riches of the Rosary is both informative and inspiring. I wish that more of Fr. Harty's books were still in print."
1,Do not buy this product!!!!,"I'd give it zero stars but that is not an option on this form.This virtual ping pong game does not work. The game unit either does not detect the paddles or crashes every time we try to play it. We have put in fresh batteries and tried everything. It could be that we have a malfunctioning unit, but it's not worth it to try to return it, buy another one and have our child disappointed all over again.A piece of junk."
3,Where's the oldies???,"This movie had great '60s and '70s soul ballads and ""lowrider"" oldies playing in the background throughout, yet none are on the soundtrack.If they had used some of those oldies with the modern hip hop songs and put them in a similar sequence as in the movie, this would have been one of the best soundtracks ever."
2,blech :(,"not a good soundtrack at all. I don't even remember the songs on it cause they weren't good and I only listened to it once. The best part, the score, is not on the soundtrack. But, I recently tracked that down on a CD by John Taylor called Metafour (not available on Amazon for some reason). Get that if you liked the movie"
1,not woth the money,"I have read countless books on hauntings and this has to be one of the worse ones.It's like a pamphlet,not a book.The font is huge.It basically reminded me of a 2nd grade book.Lots of spelling errors & Way to short!Don't waste your $18.00 on this."
4,overall interesting,overall interesting and entertaining book.great read for a stormy night.several points i would have wished were adressed in more detail.
2,Not that great,Thought this movie would have been better! I found the acting pretty bad and one character was just more annoying than anything. Id pass on this movie!
4,Remarkable account of spiritual survival,"I had the great pleasure of meeting Wayne Carlson on a cross-Canada music festival train trip in April 2004. Many of us on the train bought Wayne's book, and I read it with interest and pleasure. Doing so increased my astonishment that anyone could spend as much of a life in such lousy circumstances and emerge with humanity and humor intact. His narrative proves that he has. In an age when, certainly in the U.S., and probably to some extent in Canada as well, any pretense that the criminal justice system is intended to rehabilitate anyone is nothing but pretense, Wayne's story indicates that rehabilitation is possible. Great compelling read."
5,m850 delivers,"I have this cable running to a polk psw10 for the moment. It instantly improved the low end sounds coming from my home theater. While the psw10 is an adequate starter sub, I can't wait to connect this cable to something a little beefier. Judging from what the m850 did for this budget sub, I can only imagine how awesome it will make a higher end sub sound. Thanks Monster for another great product."
5,"QUALITY,MATERIAL,AND TRANSMITING SOUND","QUALITY,MATERIAL,AND TRANSMITING SOUND,GREAT PRICES AT THIS PRODUCT AND EXCELLENT REVIEW,MY NOTE FOR THIS CABLE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA EXCELLENT .I'm recomended this product."
4,Right About Now,"This album I must say is pretty damn good, as Talib Kweli always is. Good beats and intelligent rhymes that tell a real story. Not as good as Quality but still an awesome investment."
3,Flash Gordon & Roll Off Me - WTF???,"Come on Kwe. Other tracks on this album range from aight to good, a definite improvement from Beautiful Struggle but definately not up to par w/Black Star & Reflection Eternal or even Quality"
4,"Album Is Dope!! If you like Talib, you will love dead prez also so check that out to!!","Like I said this is that real hip hop right here and if you like this be sure to check out dead prez and if you in cali be sure to catch their first L.A. performance in 4 years as it will be hot!! May, 13 2006!! Straight From Chappelle's ""Block Party"" Dead Prez With Ras Kass, DJ Revolution Of Wake Up Show, KDAYS Icy Ice & More TBA.... 350 Pine Ave., The Vault 350...Long Beach, CA 90801....An Extremely Limited Amount Of Pre-Sale Tickets Available Now For On-Line Purchase @ www.thaformula.com & @ Your Local Record Shops"
5,Live recordings really shine,"This CD-single shines! not just the soul stirring renditions of Please (studio and Live) but the real star of this CD single is the Live recording from Rotterdam of ""Where the Streets Have No Name"" to my knowledge this is the first produced release of this tune done live. when listening to it make sure to pay special attention to The Edge's guitar work. it is brilliant and almost steals the tune away from Bono's forceful (if slightly altered) lyrics. Also listen for the new bass line. For any true U2 fan this is a MUST BUY"
5,U2's Taste of POP Rocks!,"This cd magically mixes the old and new and proves once again why U2 live is the best! If you miss Popmart or ""missed"" it altogether this is an excellent taste of the feast U2 served on the road night after night. The live version of Please is a passionate performance not to be missed! And the versions of Where the Streets Have No Name and With or Without You rock! The memories from the past and hopes for the future entwine with the stirring closer, Staring at the Sun. A beautiful ending to a fabulous cd! Absolutely mindblowing!"
2,A huge disappointment,"As much as I wanted to finish this book, I gave up at the halfway point. The typos were excessive, and the entire book was one very long chapter! Such a shame to ruin what could have been a great book."
4,-Gotta Have At Least One-,Every home/office library needs at least one of these. I enjoy just sitting down and reading this like you would any other book. Highly Recommended!!
3,Ordered for Special Reason,"This is a great video if you are planning a trip to Italy. The only reason I gave it a 3 is because I ordered it for a group of Special Ed kids. We are traveling different countries and I pay for all of this out of my pocket. The scenery and guide are great, it just may not hold their attention as well as one produced for educational purposes."
5,Ideal shoe for pole dancers,This shoe is the perfect shoe for pole dancers. The fit is fairly narrow but I like my pole shoes too tight so they won't wobble and twist my ankle.
4,Nice short read. High value. Right to the point.,"This is definitely not a programming book. It's a lot more like reading a Gartner report or other market research/prediction report.Pro: Learning about the existence continuation servers was excellent and would have made the effort to read the book worth it alone. It made me think, ""yah...why do we put up with the hassles of the stateless HTTP model?""Con: There were some pockets of knee-jerk, anti-Microsoft sentiment that I found tired and off-putting. It also stuck out like a sore thumb since the rest book is so open-minded and takes a seriously cold, hard look at the state of Java and the alternatives.Summary: If you're an independent consultant or the owner of a dev business, you should read this book. He might not be right but it's a heads up that there's probaby going to be another sea change in tech. I think he's dead-on that Java and .NET have gotten too bloated to serve the small and middle sized dev project."
1,Script Kiddies write a book,"The author basically states that java and C++ are out. His proof of this is that he asks some unqualified and unknown friends to give their opinions in little interviews. Be honest - how many of the people interviewed did you ever hear of?For the adults: I do think that pure script, non-compiled, no byte code languages like Ruby do have a future in toy programming, but certainly not in any serious applications like Photoshop, Premiere, Maya, 3D Studio, or even developers tools. The author has the strangest attitude considering he has no credentials and worse - he has NO facts to backup his claim about the death of Java. i.e. If you drop in on surveys such as tiobe.com it seems that Java and C and C++ are actually the top languages currently.This is a book written by script kiddies to promote scripting and unstable programming platforms."
3,Limited Fun,"Make sure you have a router that can support Xbox Live or you'll have some trouble setting up.The DEMO MotoGp is fun, but you are limited to certain tracks and cycles. It would not have hurt to give us a full version.Tons of cursing, music playing, dropped games, etc. The sad thing its all done mostly by young kids.Not a whole lot of compatible games besides sports."
5,Xbox.... Online.... Equals.... Total.... FUN!!!,Now let me put this into words for everyone who plans on buying it!!! Everyone else is saying it sucks and i got lags and stuff so let's straight this out. Xbox live is fun but you MUST have a broadband or cable connection. The reason people are complaining about lags are because they are going through dial-up. It is also $50 a year or $6 a month. You must also buy another cable that is sold seperatly. Now not all games are for xbox live! The game must have under the logo have an orange line saying live. That means it is online enabled. Some of my favs. are Mech Assault and Unreal Championship. Now if this review was helpful please take a moment of your time to click yes on the bottom so i know i helped. Thanks!!!
2,Microsoft's true colors,"Being part of the Beta crew I quickly found something that I did not like at all. In order to sign up for Xbox Live you must give them a none check/debit credit card in order to use it at all. Eventhough you already paid for one years subscription. I might be ok with it, if I were the only one to be using it and if they told me what the renewal rate was since there going to automatically charge me for it at the end of my subsription. However, they don't do any of that, and since my little brother also want's to use it I have to watch him to make sure he doesn't go buying all the software he wants with my credit card. It's an obviouse scam that I dought any parent would put up with, the only way I could get it to work without giving out my credit card was to go buy a $$$ prepaid credit card and use that instead. This is way to much of a problem when compared to PS2 FREE online service."
4,Good choice of tracks.. but where is Among the Living ?,"I wouldn't go as far as saying that this is a must-have CD by the great band, but there are some tracks on it that are outstanding.The quality is certainly not the best for a live album (for a lesson in quality live recordings, look at Iron Maiden's Live after Death), but there is still some killer tracks here.However, I am still wondering my Among the Living is not on here - in my opinion, this is one the best songs they ever did as a live set.I love the live version of Bring the Noise with Public Enemy - these guys pioneered alot of the sounds that you hear now with bands like Limp Bizkit, Korn, POD etc and you can hear that in this track - simply awesome.The crowd/live atmosphere is not really transferred onto this recording, especially with those recorded in the studio with a ""live"" audience.Still, this is an Anthrax album so that alone gives it some merit !!!"
3,A Taste of Old School Metal,"New frontman John Bush is not featured on this CD which captures the Anthrax of old. Classic songs like Parasite, Antisocial, and Bring the Noise are found, but the recording is not of the highest quality. Lesser known tracks like I am the Law and In My World were recorded in a small club and sound awesome."
4,street classic,"I had seen this movie about 8 years ago, and was looking for it ever since. It is a little exaggerated, but all movies are. I like it because it is based on reality. I enjoyed it!"
4,Great Movie,This is a great movie for any one that wants to take a look back into old times in Great L.A. It is also very fuuny and has a lot of actors that you might recognize from these type of movies. ALL and ALL great movie and a must have in any collection.
4,Fun to watch...,I enjoyed watching this movie...I have it in fact. The characters are sooo real...I mean I grew up with girls just like that. I see them now and again and many of them haven't outgrown the whole scene oh well...it takes all kinds. I didn't buy the two best friends having babies from the same guy. That is a no no among homegirls...not that it hasn't happened but it's not common. It was a cool movie...though it does promote stereotypes of Latinas...not all of us are or were bangers or sit around doing nothing all day. I would have liked it better had a Mexican wrote and directed it but hey none of us did...anyway I recommend it just keep an open mind while watching.
2,Same Old Same Old,"I was looking more for a book that would address me where I am. I am in my late 70's and have already gone through the healthy eating habits and just standard stuff to keep healthy. It didn't give me anything I haven't already covered and lived. So, maybe for someone younger and less well read, it will be of help. It was just a ho-hum book for me. Diet, attitude, physiology, etc. I wanted something new and exciting. Not there."
5,Best CD of Brazilian music I've bought in a while.,"I've followed this group for a while and must say I love this CD. Fernanda Takai has a great voice and the songs are all well written and arranged. My two favourites are ""Antes que seja tarde"" and ""Eu Sei"" - the second being an excellent cover of a Renato Russo/Legiao Urbana song.I listened to this CD in my car for weeks non-stop and recommend it highly!"
4,Behind Rebel Lines,"Behind Rebel Lines, by Seymour Reit is a very interestingbook. The book is about a woman, named Emma, who jions the union army disguised as a man. Emma is very corageous and even though she signed up as a nurse, she is soon working as a spy. Reit does a good job of giving details about Emma's adventures behind enemy lines. This is a very exciting book that gives a good picture of what it might be like to be a spy. The book also gave the reader an idea of what it might be like too be a woman and have to sit on the sidlines when you really want to be helping. emma was a patriot and awoman's rights activist. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adventurous, historical fiction."
2,Why is this even a CD?,I LOVE PJ Harvey but this album really doesn't deserve to be one of hers. Very few songs are even slightly interesting at all. Boring. Dull. Don't buy this unless you are a complete fanatic of hers. Stick to the original albums. Don't bother with this one. It's not very good.
4,Raw and Rare,"You can download some things online, but PJ Harvey's 4 Track demo's is her in RAW RAW form. I loved old PJ when she was more gritty, angry, and some what psychotic. This is a keeper for the collection."
3,A pretty decent Doctor strange collection,"It's pretty good but most of the storys follow a formula and i found the caracter of doctor strange to be a little boring. The storys are entertaing but they wont rox your sox and there are better Marvel Essentials out there. All in All, it's ok. Worth reading, but a little forgetable."
5,jimmy's wifey cause thats my boo!!!,"Anything that he dose i love it! He is my favorite rapper,video director everplus he looks GOOD !!! Any body who dose not get this cd is stupid!!"
2,ok-just ok,"for the first five minuts the distruction is cool but then it gets really r haven't unlocked free roam, however, just playing the missions, it doesn't seem like free roam could be all that fun. there . simply wouldn't be anything to do. even running over people is really [bad] in this game they just kind of fall dopwn and then get back up again. as for the objects, it is like Spyhunter whewre there is that arangement of [stuff] you can go through and they kind of just sorta of sink onto the ground. the gameplay is fairly fun though, and the graphics are really good-exept for the horid frame rate! ... asa for the shuting part, it is lame and doesn;t reallyh make the game better.I think I will sell it and get burnout; maby that will be better. after that I will save up for ""The Getaway'..."
2,Not the best of the series,"The ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" series was a great invention for kids, and the first 14 or so were very interesting. However, simply put, R.A. Montgomery is not very good at writing them, unlike his colleague Edward Packard. Arbitrary, preachy, and sometimes practically incoherent, his books are only for rabid fans of the genre."
4,Finally...The Truth About Men By a Man,This book was great. I finally realized things that I never knew I was doing wrong as well as finding out about how men thisnk. It's like having a cheat sheet on men. It helped me discover the 4 most important things men are slooking for in a relationship. It also ashared things that men would never come out and tell us. I enjoyed evey chapter with the exception about the sex chapter...but it was written by a man... Obviously the author thinks that everyone in the world who is going to have a successful marriage must have sex first and there are still people in the world who eith don't do that or don't buy that it's o.k. Other than that narrow minded view the author seemed right on point.
4,"Better Effects, More Action, bit too Light","WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS !!Overall a good sequel. Just that it got away from the semi-gloomy theme of the first matrix and that turned me off a bit.Nice allusion to some human fantasy characters and their purpose for existence in the 'matrix-world'. Which is anachronistic being the the machines took over in the 21st century.Put a dent in my expectations of Neo's possible rising omnipotence and his place as the singular 'hero' figure.Gave Morpheus and Trinity a good test run of their skills against the agents.In itself a great movie, not as good IMHO as the original but a great movie for Matrix fans."
3,disappointing movie - good dvd,the only reason im giving this movie four stars is the fact its on DVD and that you can now skip through the mindless bull and just watch the cool action sequences. i know this movie was a major letdown but some scenes will go down in movie history. i'll definately go see the third one just to see how it ends. i recommend that you rent this if you haven't seen it yet bcause you'll probably want ur money back.
4,"Basic message of The Matrix ""Wake Up""","Though this movie was not as good as the first,this is definately a thinking ""man"" movie.If you wanted more special effects,I advise you wait for ""Spider-Man II"" in 2004.If you want a movie that will engage your brain cells than ""The Matrix:Reloaded"" is the movie for you.Despite a few special effects that were new,none of them was breath taking except the freeway scene.Once again this movie is more about philosophy and ""waking up"",choosing the right direction that is not a selfish one,but Neo followed his heart instead of what was right."
2,Disapointing....,"Loved the first one so I couldn't wait to get reloaded. For sure the effects where well done but perhaps to long and drawn out and actually became tedious and boring, and as for the Zion segment? I thought I was having a flash back of the scene in the Ten Commandments where the people of Israel can't seem to wait for Moses and have an orgy. Also all the caracters seemed to lose what made them special individually. What a disapointment"
3,Snazzy Packaging; Not Much In The Box,"Once again, following the rule rather than the exception, the sequel does not quite live up to the original. While Matrix Reloaded has exemplary action scenes and state-of-the-art CGI effects, the movie is not as cohesive as the original Matrix."
1,What a Disappointment,"Matrix: Reloaded. Save your money. What a god-awful piece of crap. Discombobulated story, bad acting, bad script, very little story direction, even bad musical score. What a disappointment. We had stayed up late the evening before the premiere, after a longer than necessary week, just to see the first Matrix again to make sure we had the story details right. Unfortunately, it seems like the whole Lord of the Rings or Star Wars all over again. The first one(s), outstanding, the sequel financially successful on hype or anticipation alone, but falling flat as a story. When will Hollywood stop producing products based on popularity and go back to talent or substance? My only hope now is that every character will die in part three so they can't make another sequel."
3,MATRIX RELOADED,"I still like the original because it was original , cool stuff & cool action . I think KEANU REEVES are THE ONE . He was born to be THE ONE . GREAT ACTION .For MATRIX RELOADED , cool CAR CHASE but I wonder why NEO look like CG especially when he is fighting with AGENT SMITH clones . Am I watching MATRIX RELOADED or I was playing ENTER THE MATRIX ?Anyway is still good for the action scenes but weak for the story plot .For the DVD , why there are no DOBLY DIGITAL EX ? Picture quality are excellent with good detail & color resolution .Sound is aggresive in DOBLY 5.1 but seem to be too low level . I have to turn up the volume to feel the impact especially the dialogue scene which difficul to hear .THANK YOU to WARNER BROS HOME VIDEO for changing their dvd packaging . KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK . LOOKING FORWARD FOR T3 packaging ."
1,How to destroy a franchise,"This was on par for sequels, which means it was horrible. Besides the blatant commercialism, there was no threat in the fight scenes any longer. This reduced them to flying tag matches. The love story is sappy and the character speeches are tedious. Save your money and watch the first one again."
3,Matrix again,"Taking the original matrix one step further and deeper. Seeing the inner workings of Zion was exciting. A little too sexual in places, that was a surprise, even a rave party of sorts.Not as good as the original, but it definately had some very interesting concepts."
1,Ditto,"Ditto comments. Scenes tooooo long, Orgy and sex scenes should have been cut (no relevance) and the movie was a yawner all the way to the end where it actually started to get interesting and then...it ends. blech!"
1,"GREEN PILL RED PILL, THIS MOVIE WAS A PILL","ALL I CAN SAY IS WHAT A WASTE OF A GOOD BEGINING . DON'T BUY IT, DON'T RENT IT. JUST GO GET THE FIRST MOVIE AND ENJOY."
4,Unwitting Sequel Saved by DVD Features,"Yes, Reloaded disappointed many, but not as many as Revolutions did! ;) This sequel is fun, has great action, creative new characters, unlogical abilities, relatively weak plot and the beginning is terribly slow. But, this DVD has some great features, including a how-did-they-do-that regarding the nearly 15 minute long freeway chase scene. The great thing about this DVD is you can skip all the crap and go straight to the good stuff, over and over again!"
1,Why sequels shouldn't be made.,"This movie is a perfect example of why sequels shouldn't be made.Nearly no story, laughably lame and predictable love story between people with no onscreen chemistry together. If only there had been maybe 20 more Mr Smiths.... it would have been blatantly farcical. I'd compare having to sit through this movie to having to sit through Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, but this experience might have been worse. The only way I'll watch the 3rd in this series is if it's the Matrix Reformatted."
2,Certainly not more than 2,"I loved the first 1, but this 1? Pfff just 2 much crap, Neo can handle 100 agents, Neo can reanimate, Neo Neo Neo. It diserved 2 stars from me because of the special effects where nice. And Jada Pinkett is hot, ow yeah also nice car that she is driving. And the scene where everybody is dancing like monkeys for like 5 minutes?? What was that all about????"
5,Excellent!!!!,I'm alittle confused by previous reviews.I think it was a great action movie sequel.Not only did the action scenes blow me away but the twists and turns of the plot were excellent.Matrix reloaded was the perfect sequel...no not as original but it did take us further down that rabbit hole.
3,Matrix Reloaded,"A few unnecessary scenes which veered from the plot, with at least ten-fifteen minutes of the film wasted on them."
2,Lack of extras baffling,"Considering that ""The Matrix"" was and still is the gold-standard of DVD features (multiple audio tracks, commentary, several documentaries and featurettes, alternate viewing options ('follow the white rabbit'), cast and crew bio information, and MORE all on a single disc!), the absence of any such features on the 'Reloaded' DVD is disheartening. I can only speculate that Warner Bros. Home Video is planning another 'Matrix Revisited'-type DVD to sell separately and make more money off of. 'The Matrix Reloaded' itself is a rare work of art. The DVD edition is about as pathetic as a Paramount DVD release. It is the quintesential waste of the DVD format, offering little over a VHS tape edition or a bootleg. Rent it or watch it off cable. Don't buy this version. Wait for the inevitable 'Special Edition' to come out."
5,"Great Follow-up, brothers Wachoski!","Often during the sequels to movies most are disppointed. With the exception of a less than great plot--tHE HIGHWAY SPEEDCHASE ARE WORTH THE PRICE ALON!!! I've always liked the spectacular, esp in highway chase scenes. This by itself makes the movie worth getting [about 30 min chase seen with outta this world effects].Anything extra the film uses in fx is just a special added bonus. Overall the storyline of the first Matrix was good; here you get less plot but bigger bang for your buck,,,just watch the chase scene...you know you want toWhen I worked as a medic I woulda tripped for an ambulance run with this much adrenaline!"
2,"Visually Pleasing, Incomprehensible Story","I did not have a clue about what was going on in this movie. I did see the first movie and did not like it. I went to the second with some teenagers. No one enjoyed it or understood it. I consider myself a reasonably intelligent person but I did not get this movie at all. It is one thing to create a movie which is deep and thoughtful, this was neither deep or thoughtful - just confusing. Mr. Reeves gives us his usual performance - bad (he will always be ""Ted""). Like the first installment, I felt I was in a 2 hour video game."
4,Not sure why soo many hated it,"I'll admit that my expectations were extremely high and I was let down just a little, but I thought this movie was very good. I like The Matrix a little better but I thought Reloaded had enough drama and action to appeal to all Matrix fans. On the eve of their fight with the sentinels, the people of Zion celebrate the only thing they have left, their humanity. To keep their humanity, Neo, Trinity and Morpheus must somehow defeat the controller of the matrix. The movie ends with a cliff-hanger that had everyone wondering what's going to happen next. Forget the bad reviews and see it for yourself."
2,The Matrix Reloaded Blows,"Anyone who claims to enjoy the Matrix Reloaded is either a special effects junkie or a retarded sociopath. The special effects in this movie are mind boggling, but after watching the movie a second or third time it is excruciatingly boring. The story, which spins a complicated, moronic web of choppy, incoherent dialogue, absolutely SUCKS and pales in comparison to that of the original Matrix movie. To top it all off, Keanu Reeves, who was tolerable in the original film, really shows his talent for crappy acting. This movie gets two stars for action and special effects, period."
3,"Not Bad, but not as good as the first","This wasn't a bad movie, but it seems to be worse than it is because of one reason...... It was the sequel to a GREAT movie. A movie that broke new ground and began a new genre. I think if this had been the first movie in the series, it would have received better reviews. It is awfully difficult to follow a great movie with another equally great movie. All in all, this is worth seeing."
2,what happened?,"what the hell happened?!the first flick was pretty damn good, and then they throw this flaming pile of trash at us.what? just because we get an amazing car chase scene and a couple cool fights, it makes the horrible dialogue and the tired story acceptable?WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T BUY THIS!!!"
2,Reloaded ... with blanks !!!,"This movie is so bad it deserves to be smashed over and over again. Probably the wachowskys dont understand that the fans expected more from this sequel because the original was very good. Instead, they decided to create a remake of the STAR WARS saga, except that this time occurs in the Matrix. Check this if you dont belive me : Luke Skywalker ( the New Hope as a Jedi ) is Neo, The Force are Neo's powers inside the Matrix, the Millenium Falcon is the Nebuchanasser( however it is spelled ), Princess Leia is Trinity, Han Solo is Morpheous, Darth Vader is Agent Smith, The Emperor is the Architect and so forth ...Not to mention that the movie lasted 2.5 hours just to find out that the Matrix is on its 6th version. Matrix 6.0 ??How about Matrix Advanced Server 2003 ??? Gimme a break !!!"
2,disappointment,"The Matrix was a 5-star movie, easily, and it stands on its own. This one was a waste. This sequal is just the same packaging, but with nothing inside. The story goes off on tangents that really don't offer anything but pointless clichés. And then, where the story does lead... wow that's stupid. This is not even worth a rental unless you just need to see the leather and sunglasses from a few more angles (that's my second star, still got the cool look)."
2,What...,"I have one question for the cast and crew for Matrix Reloaded. Why did you do to the series? The frist one was off the hook, and when heard there was going to be 2 more films I was excited, so I preordered it for 10 bucks. But when i was watching it i was thinking why in Gods name did i buy it, OK the highway seen was good, but the sex part was a waste of time. I just hope the 3rd is a pick better. But DO NOT BUY IT UNLESS YOU ARE A HUGE MATRIX FAN."
4,Have a college education? You'll enjoy this movie.,"Although it wasn't as streamlined as the original Matrix, this Sequel certainly held it's own. In my own humble opinion, it was bloated, it was slow... it was a love story under the pretense of being an action sci-fi adventure. It was exactly what it needed to be to bring in the big bucks, and prep you for the next one, Matrix Revolutions.... There's lots of action, lots of love making, and who knew that the populace of Zion is all minorities. Yay! Plug me in! For the action alone, you should see it in Dolby digital. But don't expect it to be better than the original. It's not the tight little package that the average dolt will enjoy. If you free your mind before seeing the movie you'll enjoy it."
2,"Matrix Revolutions, don't let me down!","I saw this movie in the theaters, and maybe I was just expecting too much, because it didn't hold a candle to the first Matrix.Granted, it had some excellent fight scenes, but there was so many scenes that were obviously computer animated that it felt like I was watching a video game on a big-screen t.v. The choreography was awesome, but the scenes in between weren't compelling or inspiring or thought-provoking. They seemed like an extended version of what the final movie should have been, with irrelevent extra scenes put it.I loved the first Matrix...who didn't? I really hope the Wachowski brothers don't let me down in November and ruin the final installment of the trilogy...."
2,This Movie SUCKS!,"The only thing that this movie has going for it is the Special Effects! Otherwise, it would just be a piece of SH*T! The only reason why I gave it 2 stars was because of the Special Effects. Stay away from The Matrix films! FAR AWAY! Go see Bad Boys II instead! It blows The Matrix AWAY!"
2,matrix reloaded is garbage,"I was disappointed. The Matrix Re-loaded is nothing but[...]. Gone is the mystery of the characters, and the environment. The Zion Footage was nothing more than an excuse to extend the film. The Morpheous character is that of a Shakespearean Thespian now, and Neo is now superman and flies away at will.... and who cares about the relationship of the Matrix computer administrator and his girlfriend?....many of these scenes were wasteful. The fight sequence with Neo and the mutiplied agents became irritating after 15 minutes or so. This film failed for me. I can't recall any scene that gave me a feeling of enlightenment here. The original matrix had a mystery behind it with less intense acting, but a realization of a larger reality. What we are faced with here is badly worded dialog, and marvel comics reloaded. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title"
1,Ugh.....,"From such fertile soil(the superb Matrix) blossoms a reeking Turd Flower. Sooooo much of this movie; and Matrix Revolutions; were completely unnecessary. The special effects LOOK LIKE EFFECTS and the story is convluted by virtue that it is poorly written. I've heard complaints that people were confused, but it's all right there. You just have to look past the smoke & mirrors plot distractions and the contrived/forced action sequences. Unlike the Matrix were the story flowed organically, this and Revolutions feel laboured. The Wachowski Bros. must have gone ""OH CRAP!!! It MADE money AND the want MORE!!!"" and thrown every half baked idea they had as nine years old. Rent the superior original and imagine your own sequels. They can only be better."
1,The Matrix Regurgitated,"I just don't get it. Is good movie Sci-fi defined by too many computer generated special effects and Kung-Fu fightin'? This is just an awful movie, with an awful story line, based on an awful premise. You have the directors recreation of some kind of Dante's Inferno. Keanu Reaves delivering his lines like some bad robot in the Hall of Presidents or some dime wax museum. Add to that his wearing that cassock. And the cheap Superman pose as he flys throught the air is hilarious. Laurence Fishburne delivers his lines in speech mode. Did I tell you there is Kung-Gu fightin? And more Kung-Fu fightin' and so on and so on, well you get it. Add to this the pseudo Eastern philosophy peppered with Christian terminology and the dialogue is just too taxing. Even worse is that you can see that many of the fight scenes are just computer animation. I can't go on, this movie is just too awful. I say take away all their computers until the write a good story and real Science Fiction."
5,"Five Stars, BUTTTTTT only for the Special Effects","Story was kind of lame, but the SPECIAL EFFECTS are well worth it. I wish I could have seen this in the theaters, but the bad/mixed reviewes kept me away. I still really think this movie is a great movie, but only for the eye candy."
3,Very Different from the Original,"This sequel really threw me for a proverbial loop. I was going into it expecting Bill, Ted; you know maybe a cameo by Napoleon... When I saw Keanu I figured, ""Alright, so he's goth now, that's cool."" Then out popped his NEW friend Trinity, and apparently this Morpheus character took over for Ruffius (Did the actor who played ruffius die?). Anyway, I did like the substitution of the ""Hovership"" for the phone booth, a little more time-travel realism (After all, I've been in phone booths, and I've never time-traveled). And that first Bill and Ted movie must have made some !CASH! because they pumped this new one full of special effects! All in all, I liked it, but I think that they could have done a better job of connecting the plots of the 2 movies."
1,totally abysmal!,saw this monstrosity on an imax screen. appropriate for such a huge disgustingly ugly mess. these people are actors? this is entertainment?
1,Matrix Reloa-Dud,"Reeves cannot act his way out of a Grocery Store-but we already knew that. Not that he had much to work with here. This is really a Japanese sci-fi anime' with some real humans thrown in. Reeves style worked for the original Matrix, which was pure fun, new sci-fi, that had a strong team of chartacters working against an all encompassing AI. Reloaded takes all the good ideas of the M1 and trashes them to oblivion. MAtrix 2003 created a massive action flick with scores of soulless humans, from the egg of the original M1 combat team. Sorry mess, but the W boys made a billion dollars, so they should be happy. Awful stuff."
3,Hard act to follow,"This movie continues the struggles of Neo and the people of Zion against the Matrix. While not as good as the first, this movie was still entertaining.The time is supposedly six months after the end of the last movie and the Matrix is mounting a major (and final attack) on Zion. The leaders of Zion must decide to attempt a counterattack or trust in 'The One'. The struggles of Neo and the decisions he must make...or are the decisions already made for him?The fight scenes are great. My one criticism is that there was probably one too many fights. Bullet time is fantastic, but even too much of a great thing is not great. Having a fight to showcase the effect is not really neccessary at this point.One must see from the DVD is the MTV Movie Award clip. I found it hilarious.Following suit with other sequels, this one does not live up to the original. However the bar was set extremely high. It is better to look at this as the second installment of a larger story."
2,Video Game,"I really enjoyed the first Matrix movie, but this one was disappointing. There were plenty of action scenes, but they seemed very repetitive, except for the freeway chase, which was good, as well as the motorcycle chase downtown. It would have helped, too, if the audience had been given just a little bit of review with some plot device that wasn't too cumbersome. It took a little too long to get back into the world of the matrix. The direction was only adequate, the script less than adequate, and the acting very inconsistent. I hope the next Matrix movie is a step up from this one."
2,"Disappointing, yet with interest...","Compared to the first movie, Matrix Reloaded, was disappointing in terms of how much time was wasted on fight sequences. These struck me as dazzling displays of special effects (in the tradition of Crouching Tiger, Sleeping Dragon), but with a sense of ""what's the point?"" On the other hand, I was fascinated by the development of the conflicting worldviews of Morpheus and the computer overlords.If the third movie lives up to the first movie, then the second movie will simply be a necessary stepping stone to get there, but if the third fails to measure up, I think I'll stick with just the first movie."
2,Not as what I expected,"After reading the reviews, I thought this was an excellent deal and placed an order immediately. Maybe I expected too much of these towels, I am a little disappointed. They are soft, but the red color of the washcloth fades quickly as I use it, especially in warm water. They definitely not worth more than $10."
5,Daughter loves Littlest Pet Shop!,"My daughter (8 yrs.) received some Littlest Pet Shop toys for Christmas last year and they're the one thing she's played with pretty consistently throughout the year. I ordered her the ten pack for Christmas this year and she was tickled with it. No, we didn't receive the set pictured but it's not a big deal. I buy them for my kid to play with, not to collect. She was enchanted with the spider and chinchilla. I do have to admit - those suckers are cute. I highly recommend these for girls growing bored with Barbie!"
3,Ok,This movie was ok and it wasnt what I thought it would be. It lost me during the whole movie. But hey I gave it a chance.
1,Do not see this film if you're a DD fan.,"Just don't. None of the original cast except Samantha, and she can't act. This is an insult to the genius of Donnie Darko."
1,If you liked Donnie Darko don't waste money on this.,"I thought this movie was going to be amazing. I was wrong. I also thought that this movie was taking pace the same time as the other one, again I was wrong but I guess this one could be my fault. S. Darko captured none of the first films points or the plot or anything. S. Darko had seemingly no plot at all. Most of the time I was watching this I had no idea what was going on. Also they bring back those gooey things that show you where the people are going and they behave differently in this movie, with no explanation. Many things are left open ended and very little is explained. If you like good movies, please don't watch this."
1,Juvenile fan-fiction with a budget.,"Uninspired garbage - captures none of the magic of the original film, and instead focuses on rehashing visual cues. It's not clever, it's not mysterious, it's not fun. It's hard to imagine a worse way to disgrace a director you love than to make an unwelcome sequel to his signature film."
1,This is just plain crap!,I never thought that something following the great Donnie Darko would be this bad. Boy was I wrong.Ignore this piece of franchise exploiting trash!
1,Wow this movie is terrible!,"Even if the original cast and crew attempted to provide a sequel it would have been hard enough to work, however this was simply a very bad,bad,bad idea! The only thing I can relate this to is Halloween III which had no business in the franchise as this shouldn't have either! I'ts like the backstreet boys trying to cover the Beatles! For ethical reasons the producers and anyone else involved should pull this movie and refund the money to to those unfortunate enough to buy it like the tainted peanut butter! And to make things even more ironic this sad waste of money has the terrible actress from saved by the bell and showgirls.....I can't go on anymore, my blood pressure is going through the roof!"
5,Excellent Movie!!!,"I remember the first time I bought ""Donnie Darko"" and came here to read the opinions. There were a lot of people saying it was a terrible and awful film. Some years later a cult movie and many of the same people saying that they had always been fans. Excuse me, one thing is ""Donnie"" and other is ""S. Darko"". I'm fan of ""D.Darko"" but this movie is also a great one. Many of these people, that write that this movie is a terrible one, is the same that want to see a film exactly like the book that inspired it. This picture is a tribute to Darko, and I think it is a brave proposal and a very good one. ¡Open your mind! In some time these two opinion stars will be four, the same case as ""D. Darko""."
1,This movie was bad......... real bad,"Hey, remember that time that Donnie Darko came out and it was so confusing I couldn't enjoy it, but then after watching it again it became one of my fav movies? Then remember they were going to make a sequel? Then remember how the sequel was horrible?Me and my buddy sat down to watch this last week and about an hour into it I was saying, ""Is this almost over?"" ""Seems like it has been on for two hours!"" So boring.... The only thing that saved it was the hot chick from Step Up 2 was in there........ A matter of fact she is the only thing that made step up 2 worth seeing. She saves movies, she is like a movie doctor, man I love her. That scene in step up 2 with the rain.... man she gets 5 stars."
2,Trying to make the same Donnie Darko movie but failed,"The bad guy who thinks he is a good guy and something gets burned down, the rabbit mask, and people who die, but didn't know it. The people who made this film used all the concepts of the first movie, but truly did not understand those concepts."
1,What's the point!?,"I had no idea that this film would an hour and 45 minutes of soul crushing boredom when I rented it. This is simply a remake of Donnie Darko with semi-retarded, scantly clad teenage girls in place of regular actors. If you want to see Donnie Darko, JUST WATCH DONNIE DARKO! And if you want to see barely dressed women, JUST WATCH SOME PORN!!"
3,I guess if you really need to......,"I got this cd years ago, and it's ok. The version of Satan that appears here is the same as appears on the Spawn soundtrack (and later on their greatest hits), which is essentially the Industry Standard version with Kirk Hammett riffing over it. Not bad, but nothing remarkable. The live version of Satan has appeared on both the Satan Live #1 single, and on the bonus disc with In Sides. So really, the only reason to get this (unless you're a collector) is for the live version of Girl With the Sun in Her Head, which (like most of the live versions of tracks), is a fairly faithful rendition of the album version, with some extended parts, and a little extra drum. Again, not bad, but nothing remarkable. Since you can now find it for a buck or two, it's a decent deal if you wanted the new song, and didn't like anything else from the Spawn soundtrack."
3,Satan go away...the girl with the sun in her head ROCKS,"In an otherwise disappointing move, these blokes go for the easy move that probably some record executive thought up. Kirk Hammett does in fact beef up the song a bit, but unfortunately a real guitar player does not blend with the brilliant evolutionary forms they capture....like the last track ""The Girl With the Sun In Her Head"" surely makes up for it...when you give it a listen BE PATIENT...like I said brilliant evolution that only these guys master in this area of music."
1,Do not waste your time,"Do not waste your time. Northern Tools does not have this wrench, but they will ship one that costs $15. less, sk74530, and give no explanation. When you send it back, they will not refund your shipping charge. Read all the reviews and you will see there is a pattern. SK74530 is 50 to 250 inch lbs. Amazon.com should remove this item from the website. Sk74026 is discontinued and only a few stores have them."
3,Mr. Magoo is ruined!,"Why did somebody have to go and change Charlie's voice in some of the cartoons in this set? His new voice makes him sound like an English butler, which is completely ridiculous, considering Charlie is Chinese! The original voice of Charlie made the cartoons even funnier, and now with this voice overdub, much of the humor is lost. Everything has to be censored and politically correct these days, and I'm sick of it! Why tamper with a classic like Mr. Magoo?"
3,WHAT A SHAME! THEY CHANGED CHARLIE'S VOICE IN SOME OF THE EPISODES,"I bought this box set hoping for the best. I was happy at first, but for some strange reason they decided to change Charlie's(Magoo's asian house boy)voice in some of the episodes!? I don't know why they would do some with Charlies trademark accent( ""Ah Misa Magloo"" ""Bloss"")and some with the edited ridiculous american butler accent(he sounds a little like Robby the Robot from Forbidden Planet without the reverb)?? It doesn't make any sense at all!?? If the accent is offensive, why wouldn't they edit all the episodes? It would have been nice to have all of these classic cartoons unedited and show the edits done to them in the extras for comparison. The episodes on the DVD's look pretty clean though and if you can live with the edited junk(I can't), it is a cool set. I might pick it up at a reduced price for the unedited ones, as for now, back it goes! I do not want to support censoring these classics!"
2,"Stick to tapes, Memorex.","This box looks cool and has a neat finish, but I took mine back where I bought it after the buttons stopped working. Stop worked once in a while, fast forward worked sometimes: Memorex needs to stick to blank media. Cool looking isn't good working."
5,Your Rap Collection is Not Complete Without It,"This is one of a hand full of albums that truly speaks to the power of hip-hop in it's rawest form. Simple but hard beats, precise scratches, and a little static where necessary provide the back drop, and arguably the greatest MC to ever bless a mic takes it home. The album does have it's moments that sound dated now, but the classics, ""I Ain't No Joke"", ""My Melody"", ""Eric B. Is President"", ""I Know You Got Soul"", and ""Paid In Full"" (the most potent one verse ever recited) sound every bit as strong now as they did in '87, and have an uncanny way of making a great deal of the over produced music in heavy rotation today, seem excessive, cluttered, and ultimately lacking in what really matters - skills. ""Whoever's outta hand I'ma give 'em handles/Light 'em up/Blow 'em out like candles"""
1,What is this?,"My little brother was crying when he heard this...you can't dance to it, you can't do anything. It's just too boring, he needs more emotion, they have a track full of nothing but stratching, it's stupid."
5,"For ""Old School"" Fans","This album takes you way back, to the days when DJs were as prominently featured in rap music as were MCs; note that the name of the DJ (Eric B.) comes before the name of the MC (Rakim). The mixing and scratching are top-notch, and the rhymes are delicious. This album paved the way for the more heavily produced rap albums that followed it. If you're a fan of ""old school"" rap, it just doesn't get any better than this."
5,Dis album is in da house!,"Well, a classic album with remixes gives props to my main man Rakim long before the others like Gangstarr took over. hip hop needs more box sets like this but I hope that the record producer can make a box set for ALL of Eric B. and Rakim shebang before they get dissed."
4,Fly B Gone,"I have purchased 2 5lb buckets of this product over the last 2 years. Around the dog yard, at the camp, around outdoor kitchen. It works!!I like putting it in a plastic cup with some water, mixing it up and let the flies fill the cup up after a half a day. It is amazing"
3,Mickey Mouse Ladies musical watch,Enjoyed it for about a year and then the sweep second hand fell off the face and would get stuck in the min. and hour hands at times and stop the time. Not good for keeping time then but it did always play the music well and the mickey march was a great feature. Decided for the wear on the watch with the gold tone not staying well and the leather band having lost the tie down in the year (even with taking it off everytime I went into water) that it wasn't worth the cost of repair to replace or remove the second hand and bought another similar model.
3,Long in the back??,"Its cut weird, long in the back,., I had to alter the heck out of it but awesome material, well made. Terrible design"
1,Not recommended,"One of my students recently brought an Anton Breton violin that he had just gotten to school. The hair was coming out of the tip of the bow, and the violin won't stay in tune. Even if repairs were made, they would exceed the purchase price and would not correct the poor tone quality. My advice would be to save the money you would spend on this violin and use it for a down-payment toward a decent instrument. Check with a string teacher if you don't know where to get a reasonably priced instrument. I definitely don't recommend this one."
5,Lots of substance,"It's my favorite band so far. I own most of their albums.Largely accused of copying Led Zeppelin!!! Let's see things differently. When we learn a language, we have an accent. Mission is the language and John Paul Jones from Led Zepplin is the accent who worked Mission on a couple albums.Mixing rock, dance and world music they surpassed Led Zeppelin on lyric's level only. The poetry is intense and emotional, a kind of ""cannot live by myself but only throught you my love"".Love their ancient egypt and mid-orient beat. Love when the guitar get lost in a loop. Hate the song ""Sour pussy"" which is not a style for Mission. I am sure I would love it if it was sang by the Cure.As they say, let's do this all again"
5,Awesome,"Do they still make this? This lotion smells great, makes my skin feel extra silky, and the scent lasts longer than the actual fragrance made by Escada! I wish it will be in stock again, because I definitely will get more!"
1,What a mess. How sad. Very inaccurate.,"Unfortunately the author appears to not have had any direct contact with Sharon Schools and Children's Homes here at North Battleford, Saskatchewan, site of the Revival of 1948, which still continues today. His research is flawed and cannot stand up. His information is inaccurate and does not tell the real story. Greetings from Sharon Schools and Orphanage at North Battleford, Saskatchewan, from Terry Miller...one of the ministering Brethren at Sharon. Feel free to contact me directly for the true story. ..."
2,Disappointing,I am a huge fan of Tess Gerritsen's books. Immediately when I started reading this I could tell it was written by an inexperienced writer. The prose are amateurish and the plot rather forced. You get the impression the writer knows nothing about spy thrillers other than what she's seen in movies. Obviously Ms. Gerritsen is a talented writer and this early effort is not representative of her later genius.
5,Bath towel and washcloths,These are great towels. The thickest I ever used. Great deal with the free washcloths. I will buy this deal again.
2,Way too expensive !!,I found this item way too expensive. I feel it could have been priced lower. Luckily I bought it at a discount but I might not be so lucky the next time.
1,UNSAFE,"Length:: 0:20 MinsReceived this as a gift. I was brave/stupid enough to put batteries in it and try it out.On its third run, the pump shorted and exploded the waterproof battery case out of the top of the unit while our son was in the bath. No shock, but extremely loud bang and brown residue all over the battery housing now. It clearly leaks into the pump area. Worse, it kept running even after the lid blew off. Thankfully it didn't catch my face on the way into the ceiling.I haven't opened the watertight seal since about 3 wks ago when I put the batteries in. It was dry then. The bang when it blew the battery compartment lid off was loud enough that my ear's still ringing. Not the sort of noise you want your infant in the tub to be exposed to.Video attached of the aftermath. Don't trust your newborn to this thing."
2,Pretty useless...,"In theory this sounds awesome, but in reality is comes really close to being useless.1) The ""spa"" is nothing more than a light flow of water which isn't even enough to create bubbles, it comes out of the corner of the pump unit so hardly any of the stream will reach your baby2) The shower head has a button that is nearly impossible to keep pressed in for longer than 10 seconds, the flow of water is very weak so is not powerful enough to rinse out hair. A cup does a better job than this.3) The tub itself is pretty decent, the plateau used to lay your baby on seems nice and comfy and the temperature indicator is a nice bonus.All in all I wish we had saved our money and just gone with a normal tub, I advise anyone else to do the same."
2,More Features Not Always Better,"When I saw this tub, I thought WoW this is great. It had everything.Well after receiving the tub as a gift for my shower I decided to try it before the baby came. I am so glad that I did. The pump for the spa and shower was super loud and had a leak. The shower was very difficult to operate, I had to press really hard.The only thing that I loved about the tub was the sling. It is very nice. I think when it comes to buying a tub for a baby simple is better... in the beginning speed is key, the baby gets to cold to really enjoy the features of this tub. In my opinion get a simple tub and splurge on something else."
3,Question and Answer Format,"I like this book. It is a list of questions and answers in Q&A format. There is an order by general subject, but nothing individually. There is no index, so if you're looking for something specific, it's hunt and peck.Still it is a good compilation of facts about New Jersey. Some of them are the commonly known facts, but most of are tidbits you don't know about the state."
4,Fascinating and moving story from our past,"I knew almost nothing of the other people involved in the plot to kill Lincoln until I saw this film. Mary Surratt was railroaded and made to stand trial with no jury because the Civil War was still raging on.The actors give very credible and moving performances, especially Robin Wright as Mary and the fellow playing her lawyer.The period design is also excellent, and what happened during this trial should be reminder to all that you cannot chuck the rules out just because it's expedient or because people want someone to blame."
5,Excellent Movie,"This movie is absolutely stunning! It was shot in Savannah, GA and the scenes are beautiful. I highly recommend this movie for all people of all ages."
3,What the Hell?,"I bought this today, the blu-ray ""Deluxe"" edition, only to find scenes had been cut.***Inserting my own SPOILER ALERT***I saw this in the theater and there have definitely been scenes cut out from the original version that absolutely lessen the film. The most drastic cut is when Aiken interviews Captain Cunningham with his unit. In the theater, you got to hear Cunningham tell Aiken the truth in the field and then it cut to the courtroom where he betrays him. They have cut out the entire scene where Cunningham tells the truth on the blu-ray and many other scenes have been shortened as well. 4 stars for the original film, 2 for the blu-ray. Boo! Hiss! Don't edit after the fact. It was great the way it was, editing has only lessened it."
3,Good costumes but historically inaccurate.,"Good costumes, but historically inaccurate. Protrays Surrant is a very bad light without taking into account Confederate views. Surrant may have very well been framed."
2,A view inside a twisted view of what happened,"This movie was created with an ulterior motive in mind, and I would argue that the motive rested in trying to reflect how military tribunals are never worthy of the American values Redford supports. The way in which the trial was presented reflected too much of today's procedures, but not as much of what actually happened in the past. This does not make it fatally flawed, rather too ambitious. However, that was not what made this a bad experience for me. Rather what was the problem rested in the fact that the dialogue was far too slow, as well as the entire movie."
2,Redford's propaganda effort against Gitmo- You get to pay for it!,"This is a thinly disguised classic Hollywood lefty propaganda effort against our country's efforts to protect us from terrorism, and as such, I detest Redford's arrogance in trying to sell us copies at great expense for his overpaid cast and services!The lines are purely hypothetical, and bear no resemblance to reality."
2,SO-so storyline,"This was one of the most boring books I've bought to read. I like books with more bite and awe to the story. I can't get interested in a story of a 50something woman who's wondering what happened to the girl of her youth; and also wondering what her life would be like if she chose the other road in her journey through life. She's not unhappy, she's just curious. She loves her family, she lives in a house that belonged to her in-laws and she works at a career that makes her be a person that she really isn't deep down inside................Well, heck....................That book's main character sounds like me......and my enjoyment of reading is the escape from reality it affords me while sitting in my Broyhill with my 2 chihuahuas curled up on my lap, my favorite CD playing.The book has excellent writing and cute storylines, but not for me. Give me some kind of wierdness or dysfunction laced through my reading."
2,Well written and boring,"Rebecca, 53, looks back at her life and wonders over the course it has taken. She has 4 wonderful daughters, 7 grandchildren, a mother, an aunt, and an elderly person she lives with and takes care of. Her life has not always been easy, her loving husband died after 6 years of marriage, her daughters don't always listen to her. But she manages, runs her own business and tries to keep the family together.ladidadidadidadida...But I am not yet old! I am 32. I don't want to look back. I want to look forward. I don't want to think 'well, life has its ups and downs and you just have to enjoy those little rays of sun'. I want to live life to the max, have big expectations and huge dissapointments.Maybe I have to try this book again in twenty years."
4,For 50+ year-old persons,"This is a book for 50+ year-old persons. It tells a story how a woman, Rebecca, find herself and accept her life.The depiction neat, all the characters vivid. A good read indeed, but not for the young ones. Recommend to those who hate their present lives and families."
4,"Nice story, characters ok.....","I'm not a big Anne Tyler fan, and actually bought the book because I got it [at a good price] and thought it was by Anita Shreve (says a lot about how many books I bought with it - bet you can't guess!) But luckily my local library had the audiobook version, and for those of you that are my familiar with my reviews, you know that this is a very good thing!Nice story, although the characters are fairly unlikeable. I really wanted the main one to just get a backbone and a brain, but maybe I'm being overly harsh. Fairly painless to listen to, and the writer is excellent at portraying the insides of characters, and making them very true to life. I wouldn't be at all surprised if any of this was autobiographical. Very decent book."
5,Vintage Tyler,"The wonder of Anne Tyler is her ability to hear and capture the sounds and rhythms of the ordinary. Her characters live and talk like real people and she's got an uncanny ability to make everyday relationships and situations fascinating. She is a truly gifted storyteller whose writing never intrudes upon the story she's telling -- a skill some of our flashier, more precious authors would do well to master.""Back When We Were Grownups"" ranks among her best work. The characters are more endearing and memorable than those in ""A Patchwork Planet"" (with whom it was somewhat difficult to connect). Rebecca Davitch and her world are both comfortingly familiar and pleasantly unexpected. It's what we've come to expect from Ms. Tyler and what sends me to the bookstore every few years to buy her latest release, in hardcover, no questions asked. She is a writer of consistent quality and restraint."
2,back when we were grownups,"Excellent first paragraph....promises so much, but never delivers. The development and ending is quite predictable that one feels cheated."
3,Going Nowhere,"It was difficult for me to finish the book. I do not see where the author developes any of the characters to the point I feel like I really know them. The story is very shallow as far as knowing how characters really feel or behave;with the exception of the 100 year old ""Poppy"". I saw a glimse of his character and could picture what he would look like. The story just rambles on and on about the events in a family's life but there is no climax to the story. Rebecca,a grandmother, is the main character. She is trying to find out why she has become the person she is. She is different from what she was as a young girl. She contacts an old friend and trys to rekindle a fire with him,she trys to talk with her mother but nothing ever happens in the story that brings out the climatic circumstance I kept waiting for.I suggest borrowing the book or checking it out at the library before deciding to purchase it."
2,"As a Short Story, It Would Have Been Great","Ever been a guest at the home of a friend who is a terrific cook, and you're really hungry for protein, and bloated yourself on a starchy casserole meal to get to the meat because you felt too polite to just pick through to the meat? I kept reading and reading and reading ad nauseum to get to the juicy bits of wisdom, to the point I started to skim (not a good sign). I was starving for more of her lines like: ""Once upon a time, there was a woman who discovered she had turned into the wrong person"". Isn't that fabulous? That line alone got me thinking hard about my own life. I'm not a avid reader anymore so perhaps the fault lies with me that the story seemed too detailed. It was a good story, though, and if you like Anne Tyler's style, by all means get it."
3,A Midlife Non-Crisis,"This book might appeal to those who think they are in midlife crisis, but really aren't. Anyone in a serious crisis would be disappointed by Anne Tyler's superficial spin on the problem. Rebecca Davitch, 53, suddenly wonders how her life turned out the way it did, and ponders how it might have been different. Her efforts to answer that question at first show promise, but then fall flat. Where there is potential for strong plot development, Tyler draws back arbitrarily, almost contrary to her characters' inclinations. Rebecca's family is so large that none of the characters are developed enough for the reader to really know them. We never feel that Rebeccca is truly in crisis; her life and family, although less than perfect, aren't horrible. When she finally ""resolves"" her turmoil, I wondered why it took her so long to find the answer. It's a readable book, but it has little wisdom to offer."
3,back to boredom,"this actually spins into an indictment of academia. the college prof is one of the blandest, basic creatures that ms. tyler could possibly create. what is more pathetic? his low self-esteem to the point that he is a functional virgin or the fact that he can prepare food only if a boil technique is mandated. a sad, sorry pile of words from one of america's brightest voices."
2,Pretty disappointing,"While it was a quick read, I found that my mind was being merely occupied instead of stunned or challenged. The mopey main ""Beck"" makes only one stab at reclaiming her life - a half-hearted ""I never asked anyone to call me Beck!"" that is quickly overlooked by all around. Her children are all annoying and out there, and loose ends merely fly in the wind at the conclusion. Was there a climax in this novel because I missed it. More concretely - was there a point? What did Tyler SAY about life, humanity, love?? What greater comment did this novel make? Whatever she said, it could have been condensed to a chapter and then moved on to a story that went somewhere."
2,Don't bother unless you have to.,"If you're reading this text, don't thank your professor. While every lit student should have a cursory understanding of literary critique, this text is not the best place to get it from. Although, it is shorter than most lit theory texts, so if your Prof picked it, maybe they are being merciful and won't torture you too much with it."
3,Critical Theory Today: A User Friendly Guide,"Easy to read and understand. Well-written. An excellent idea. The views of this textbook, though are very skewed in favor of Marxism and Communism. This is not a balanced book."
4,Clear..,A clear presentation of what can be a very confusing subject. Each chapter presents a different type of theory and contains a selected bibliography divided into primary and secondary sources for further reading. It serves as a very good introduction to the subject.
3,"Yello releases another Pristine Caliber Album with ""Zebra"".","Being a fan of pop/techno music all my life, Yello is the only group out of the crop that I never get tired of listening to. And ""Zebra"" is another example of their work that strays away from ""mainstream pop"". From the opening song ""Suite 909"" the acoustics Boris Blank uses are memorizing in every tune. He has a unique talent for succussfully mixing jazz & techno (as well as other genres) together as demonstrated in the the songs ""S.A.X."", & ""How, How"". ""Move, Dance, Be Born"" is the highlight of the album. While techno has become generic in today's music era, Blank's music always bursts with orginality. ""Night Train"", ""Tremendous Pain"" and ""Fat Cry"" are the only tracks I found were weak. I can't seem to follow Deiter Meier's cryptic messages in his music. I'm more leniant to Blank's fasinating acoustics. Still, I strongly recommend this album for any Yello fan to add to his/her collection."
2,does this movie have english subtitles????????????,"Not a single review of this interesting French movie specifies if this movie has English subtitles. Oddly, not even the product information mentions this important fact. Please advise !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you."
4,2nd Best Live Album,"As a die-hard Santana fan, i felt that this album lacked some of the soul searching that ""Viva Santana"" provided. I still recommend it for any collection."
1,The hump hurts my baby,"This tub would be awesome if that hump was not there, I lay my baby in the sling part and her back lays directly on the hump in the tub. It has to hurt. I would much have prefered the 12 dollar cheapo tubs to this."
2,Great for Newborn - But that's about it.,"This tub is so nice looking. Fisher Price really put thought into how the tub looks. When my son was an infant it was great. Perfect in fact, but he reached 25 inches at 2& 1/2 months. Too big for the sling & not old enough to have total head control. I took out the sling & wow what a horrible time. I had to hold him the WHOLE time. It was horrible. Half his body stuck out of the back of the tub. Keep in mind you can't lay them down cause there is that hump there. I did call Fisher Price & they had me send it back & gave me a voucher for anything else I'd like to get. so in all it wasn't that bad. I got another tub the Safety First & so far so good. It is deep enough where he can sit unassisted & its great. Please do your research BEFORE buying.. It'll save you some time & energy."
5,Very Happy,"I wasn't sure if I wanted this bath tub after reading some of the reviews, but I got it as a shower gift.I am so happy that I did! My son was not a small baby at birth, so we didn't have issues with his size. He lies on the hammock and doesn't float at all. It's nice cause I have my hands free to wash him while he lies in it. He's 3 months old now.I put in in our bathtub and sit on the side of the tub while I wash him. That way, I can open the drain on the baby's tub when it's time to get out. To keep him warm I keep a washcloth on his chest while I bathe him. He loves his bath!!When he's bigger, I'll probably just wash him in our kitchen sink, but for now, this bath rocks!"
1,Dont' buy !,"We thought this bathtub would be great for our newborn son, but he was never comfortable in it : the sling gets very cold when wet, and the baby's back keeps bumping into the plastic part underneath. We only kept the toys that came with it and gave away the tub.My advice is to buy a very simple tub such as Safety 1st, it's enough and frankly babies like them best !"
4,Good Bathtub,I like this bathtub because I didn't have to worry about my baby sliding into the water without me holding her up when she was really little. The sling did a great job of making bathing simple when she was small. My only complaint is that there is little room around the sling to get your hand in to get some water on a facecloth or in a cup. Once my daughter was old enough to sit up we went right to a bath seat and did not use the deeper part of this tub.
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,My LO Ben loves taking a bath in Fisher price tub. The hammock keeps the baby comfortably in the water without his whole body being totally submerged. Creates a wonderful bath time experience. Ben is 3 months and we just lowered the hammock and moved him to the second stage. He now loves that he has plenty of room to splash!
3,It's an okay tub,I have had this tub for 5 months now and it's getting better as my son gets older. He enjoys his bath-but when he was a newborn the netting barely touched the water which kept him cold. Now that he's 5 months old he can sit in it a little better but it's still doesn't seem the most comfortable. He like's to kick in the tub which makes him arch his body and get hit by the hump. And the head support should be a little taller for those kids who are longer. This tub is probably better for a baby that can sit without support.
4,Great up until 5 months,"This item was great up until our son was 5 months old. Then it became really confining and uncomfortable for him. We ended up getting the Primo Baby tub for the later years. It's huge and really does keep the baby in place. Plus, there is room for our son to splash around in it."
5,Great baby bath tub,"I got this tub as a baby shower gift. It's a great tub. I started bathing my son in this tub when he was 3 months old. He's now 7 months and we still use it. It's great for transitioning. The hammock is great for small infants and you can remove the hammock as the baby grows, the hammock also has a little pillow atached for comfort. The tub also has a piece of material on the bottom of it that keeps the baby from slipping. The bottom design of this tub is very effective because the incline is just right so the baby can lean back without slipping and there's an indentation that prevents the baby from sliding.Assembly was extremely easy. The tub also came with some cute, but simple plastic toys. I would highty reccommend this product...and remember never leave your child unattended in the tub."
2,Mother of two,"The main problem with this tub is exactly as the previous review describes... the protruding bump. I owned the tub that preceded this model but it was designed to include that bump. The purpose of the bump is to hold the baby in place when the baby outgrows the baby sling. When the baby is in the sling, they slide down and that hard plastic bump is right in the middle of the baby's back. You will have to keep picking the baby up and sliding her up to get that uncomfortable plastic out of their back. When I used this tub in the toddler position, the part of the tub where my son's back sits isn't rounded and began to leave a red mark on his back after every bath, which eventually grew into a bruise-like mark. The tub only gets points for looking good but find another tub!"
3,Best without sling for slightly older baby,"My baby liked this alot at first but, as others noted, he quickly was too big for this product. We ended up removing the sling very early and just using the tub. It worked great for when he could sit with just a little assistance. As he got bigger he sat in the deeper end just fine, but we soon just started bathing him in the tub by the time he was 7 months because the tub is easy to squirm out of for very mobile kids!"
3,The sling + bump don't work together,"The sling has not ever been able to support our baby (born at 7 lbs) or keep his head above the water. And the ridge in the bottom of the tub seems to serve no purpose, and in fact seems to be detrimental to the usability if the sling. Good idea, poor design. We use it without the sling and support baby with one hand while washing him with the other."
5,Great product,I got this as a baby shower gift and I love it. It is easy to use especially with the little sling when my little one was a new born.
1,doesn't fit baby,"I owned this tub and I hated it. The ledge that the baby sits on only fit him when he was very young (only a few weeks), after that, he was sitting too high up in the tub and wasn't down in the water enough, or he would kick around so that the ledge was in the middle of his back. I ended up giving this away and buying another tub."
3,Not the best Tub out there,"I bought this tub because of Fisher-Price's reputation and was disappointed. The sling was only usable for a few weeks and then our baby became to active and large for it. When we used just the tub the baby always ended up with a mark on her back, despite the use of a washcloth to try and provide some cushion. I ended up buying the Safer Bather by Leachco and have been very happy! This tub works for some, but I usually never have problems with purchases I make and this one was the exception!"
3,sliding baby,I loved this tub when my daughter was tiny. It was perfect for sponge bathing. Now that she is 3 months old she slides right over the dividing hump into the deep water. During her bath I have to keep one hand holding her up the entire time!
5,Great!!,My daughter is a month old and loves this tub!! The sling provides great support and the bath toys are a lot of fun also.
4,seems ok,we got this bathtub for our little one due in May..so we have not tried it..the one thing i do not like is underneath the pad there is a molded seat in the actual bathtub & i got this one b/c i thought it did not have that. we had that in the tub we had for our 1st child & it just rubbed the wrong way since it is designed to go between their legs. but we'll try it.
2,Webster Computer Dictionary,This may be the latest version but I've had a copy for several years. This order resulted in a duplicate copy
5,"an excellent, life-changing book!","This book is truly changing my life! We may not realize, until reading this book, how many painful relationships we have (work, family, significant other, etc.), how much of that pain we either create or return, how many expectations we have of others, and how much we try to change others to suit our ""shoulds"". More importantly, we also don't realize how much healing power we have within us to greatly improve these same relationships! Mr. Ferguson gives us big hope, and then makes that hope tangible by teaching very practical, logical, sensible ways that we can change ourselves to change our relationships. Thank you, Mr. Ferguson, for giving me the hope and the tools to allow my heart to love others as I've wanted to for so long."
4,Decent Book,"We did not read the whole book during class, but the parts we did read were pretty good and educational."
4,Smooth soul...,I like this album...it has a few really smooth sounding songs on here and Tonya can really sing. I think it's a shame she didn't have a better career.
3,Interesting but too long,"Hunt's novel concerns the life of Edward II of England and his love affair with Piers Gaveston. Young Piers is from the low nobility of France and joins with Edward I is routing the French from Gascony. He hopes to gain lands and glory that way. The King send Piers to England to attend the adolescent heir to the throne, Edward. Edward falls immediately in love and there begins a fiery relationship that covers 12 years of falls outs, reunions, condemnations and sadness. Edward II himself does fare all that well in history, although that is not part of this novel.The book is a little too long. Once can sense what is coming halfway through and the last half is somewhat torturous. Hunt keeps on writing about birds and peasants as though the reader is not aware of what is happening. One has the temptation in the last 75 pages to skim. For the most part, however, it is an interesting and entertaining historical novel."
4,Interesting History is Hard to Capture in a Fictional Book.,"I love the story. Always wanted a fictional account of this affair that didn't borrow heavily from Marlow. My main flaw is that I was never drawn into the story. I really never care about the characters. In this sense, the characters were too historical and not fictional enough. It is difficult to write an engaging fictional account about the people of an interesting historical event. Although Hunt does this better than most people, I still felt like I was reading a great history book rather great fictional novel."
1,What am I missing?,"I bought this CD based on the numerous ecstatic reviews and recommendations it received on Amazon. I am a fan of several of the groups in the ""if you like..., then you'll like..."" list, but I was extremely disappointed by ""Heavens"". Overall, I thought it was lackluster, with few- if any- standout features. The music is jazzy and mellow, but I tend to prefer downtempo that is more layered, either with electronic sounds (Royksopp, Bent) or world-influenced elements (Thievery Corp.). Like much of the downtempo music currently available, the tracks on this album blend together in a way that is ultimately very forgettable.So I'm wondering, why is this album RECOMMENDED on almost every other downtempo-related album's site on Amazon? Do yourself a favor and DO NOT purchase this album unless you have had the chance to pre-listen to several of the tracks first."
4,Great Googly Moogly,"Excellent, excellent stuff. nice tight drums and very smooth bass. Great driving music. I like this one almost as much as urban chill 2. Very diverse sound. I like the loungy feel on 'crossbow'. neat bassline. I highly recommend this cd. Very good buy."
4,Top Notch Sounds,"Just a quick shout out to tell you all that this CD in my opinion is great I loved every track ! I can't wait till the next CD is released,good on you fellas on a job well done !"
5,AVANTE-GARDE BEAUTY...MESMERIZING!!,"This band was once ""black-metal""...but after this release, it's impossible to classify them!! This is dark, poetic beauty at it's best! It sounds like an Italian opera, combined with My Dying Bride! Fans of all ""dark music"" styles will LOVE this!! Black metal, goth metal, Dead Can Dance... even DePeche Mode fans will love it....go get it!!"
1,Poor design for aquarium divider,"The concept for this product is sound and in fact is great - however, the implementation needs much to be desired. This divider is easy enough to put together, slide the mesh into the two long side bars. Unfortunately, it comes out just as easily letting the fish you are trying to separate co-mingle again. I put this thing together 3 times and re-inserted it into the tank and finally gave up. Instead of sliding it into place on the side bars, the side bars need teeth and need to fold over to clamp onto the mesh so that it cannot slide out of place. Or some other solution needs to be developed, but this is not working for my tank. I feel like super-gluing the mesh into place but I don't know what that would do to the fish or if it would hold under prolonged underwater exposure. I am so frustrated and disappointed."
3,Harsh Words I Heard You Say,"Saucy suburban kids flirt with electro-rock and disco-beats, the end result: pensive dance-punk for your next ballroom freakout! A decent debut offering using live guitar, bass and drums, with the strength of the EP in the first track, ""Between Us and Them."""
1,Yech!,"It's too bad that a woman as smart as Whoopi Golberg has to use profanity just like it's used by street thugs and hoodies. What is her point? She might have something worthwhile and insightful to say in this nasty collection, but it is submerged in a sea of dreck...What a disgrace she is to African-American womanhood and what a terrible example to her grandchildren.But she's rich and I'm not... Reinforces the stereotype -- bigtime. Yes-suh!"
1,crap - junk - dont work - useless,"maybe it works good in a sealed box, in real life,, in a retail store of all things where those pesky fruit flies seem to be everywhere.hang 2 in the store , I dont sell food items, i sell boxed electronics, the trash is emptyed every day,, these made 0 differenece after 3 weeks,a can of raid,, made a difference in 5 minutes"
1,Terribly Biased,"I'm a leading Sinologist in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and I have read few books as bellicose and biased as this one in my whole career as scholar. His assumptions, theories and conclusions are flawed. I don't believe this guy has ever been to the Middle Kingdom. He didn't even seem to have talked to serious scholars when writing the book - there is only abstract intel background. I dare to say that this book is a serious menace to American and Chinese Civilizations since it may influence American policymakers (I'm so glad I live in Brazil). This book is NOT SERIOUS; IRRESPONSIBLE; and DANGEROUS."
2,Carpet shampoo brushes,"These brushes work fine for delicate items such as area rugs but are not stiff enough to get down into the carpet fibers to truly scrub out spots efficiently. They may do OK if you have one or two little spots, but if you are trying to do a whole room, you will be there for quite a while."
4,brushes,great fits nicely on machine.Glad to fine brushes for this old shampooer. Cleans to satisfaction. I will recommend these brushes. Pleased with shipping and especially the cost.
2,It's nice to not have a noisy monitor...when it's not beeping at me!,"My husband and I chose to buy this monitor because we wanted something that would hold connection while we were outside, didn't have a bunch of background noise or static, and something that someone else could pick up on theirs. So, about 14 months ago when we got this, it worked really well at first, for about 6 or 7 months. Then, it started to beep all of the time. I lose connection to it when I am in the house! It is the most irritating sound in the world. I called Graco and they told me that it was because the battery went bad, so they sent me a new battery pack, and well, it didn't fix it. So, I really don't suggest buying this product!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"I bought this because of it's high reviews and I'm really disappointed. One of the receivers never even worked. The one that does work has terrible reception. Overall, it's just a poor product design. It even feels cheap. I wouldn't bother attaching the handle to a strap of any sort because it would probably break. The on and off button for the part with the microphone is on the side rather than on top... so I have to pick it up every time I want to turn it off."
2,"Have to agree, do not buy","We bought this monitor when our daughter was born - it had very good range and the battary stayed charged for a couple of hours when off the cradle. WIthin a few months, the batteries did not stay charged for more than 10 minutes and the range was worse. Now (2 yrs later) it has terrible range (off or on the cradle) and will not stay charged for more than 3 minutes. I loathe it and will have to buy a new one for our new baby - silver lining. And, it was consumer reports top rated at the time!"
3,No what I expected,"Very disappointed....way over priced. Could not turn the volume up because the static was overwhelming. I tried them in different areas of the house and nothing changed. Go for the digital units. Same money but a big, big improvement."
3,dallasmom,"2nd kid, 5th monitor. Purcahased this one because of reviews and 2 receivers... very disappointed. Pops and clicks all night long, I can't sleep. AND, seperate cord, charger, and receiver... too many parts too missplace. I prefer my Sony, although only one receiver, voice activated option, very little interference, less parts too loose, long charge life."
1,Not all it's cracked up to be...,"I've had this monitor for almost a year and a half now, and I hate it. We also own an older Fisher-Price Lights and Sounds monitor, and it pales in comparison to that monitor. The Graco monitor's rechargeable battery, which is what allows it to be portable, never had a very long life, and now at not quite a year and a half old do not charge at all. The very instant I remove the monitor from its base, it's dead.Other complaints - it's not very loud. I have to crank it to it's max volume to feel like I'm really hearing anything, and even then it's not terribly loud. The lights are green and VERY bright at night. Annoyingly so. It's sound quality is only sub-par. Range is not very good. I have to place the monitor just so to avoid static on my monitor at this point.All in all, there are much better monitors out there!"
5,no interference from neighbors,we live in an apartment and tried basic monitors and had interference from the neighbors monitors but couldnt pick up what was going on in our house. since getting the digital ones we haven't had any problems. The Graco ones are just as efficient as the fancy ones and are half the price. I recommend these for people who have problems with the basic monitors.
3,regular cheap made horror,ok movie. made like all the other cheap made horrors. if you like sleepaway camp then you need to see it.
1,"Uggghhh,What a Waste of Money","This movie sucked,Seriously I was very disappointed in this movie in all areas.It ruins the classic sleepaway camp movies.It followed the same story of Angela ,who use to be a man killing people at camp,but it was done in such a horrible way.I own all three slepaway camp movies,and I thought that this would be just as good or better,boy was I wrong.Please don't even waste your time or money on this movie!!!!"
2,Pretty horrible sequel,"The only good thing I have to say about this sequel is that it follows the 1st one. Angela only appears in a cameo at the end, the acting is horrible, Ricky is barely in it, when I first look at the case I thought Issac Hayes would have a big part. Pretty bad move."
5,Classic-nuff said,"This album is the soundtrack of the early 90's and can be argued as the most influential hip-hop album to come out of the L.A. underground. Michah 9,Aceyalone,P.E.A.C.E., and Self-Jupiter easily break down words and metaphors as easily as Run-DMC rapped about their adidas. If you love rhyming and hard beats that keep going until the next afternoon then this is a must-have. From start to finish this album can rock a party and make you grab a dictionary to look up all the new words you never heard of....Freestyle Fellowship is easily the most all-time underated hip-hop artists ever to grace the mic! One thing that stands out about this album is more than half their flows are freestyle, the specialty that FF mastered when L.A. rap that ruled was gangsta rap that was one-dimensional. This music is timeless and is forever ahead of anything that comes after."
5,A classic.,"This album contantly transcends and redifines the boudaries of hip hop music. No vocal stretch is off limits, the music is distinctive and very hard hitting at times, and the lyrics are mind expanding."
3,Interesting book for Wildlife's vets and animals lover!!,"I have recently received this book at home and I started to read it. At the moment, I finished the chapter one and I started the second one and I can tell you that this book is very interesting. I had not listened about other similar book with this topic.Really, I recommend that Wildlife and Zoo's vets read this book, in order to learn more about the means to be healthy in the wild.We can learn more of Wild's medicine and probably to be able to use it in a captivity environment.Congratulations To Cindy for this book!!"

5,Adjustable door guide,"Just what I needed. we did not want to drill holes in our tiles, so this mounted to the bottom of one door and guides the movable one."
1,horrible printer,"i was initially taken with this printer because early reviews raved about it's features.. I purchased one, used it for 16 months (the warranty is 12) and then received an error message on the screen (the printer was inoperable). I called Lexmark and they accused me of adding options, which I have not. Finally, they referred me to a service technician, who was familiar with the printer and the problem. To fix the printer - the whole system board would have to be replaced, apparently they fail often. Cost for the system board $699 plus at least $200 for labor (i.e., you could simply buy a new printer for less). What a rip-off. I've previously used HP printers, and my other printer is an HP Color 3700 - which is going on it's 4th full year of use with little or no problems, unfortunately, it didn't have a duplex option when I purchased it (or I wasn't willing to pay that much extra)... I'm now moving to an HP3505x. I will never puchase another lexmark product."
2,"JFY is pleasant fluff, but HCTG is bombsville","the two movies pair bing crosby and jane wyman. first is a pleasant backstage musical highlighted by a fun role for the great ethel barrymore as the mistress of a private school. its nothing great but its fun. the second film (HCTG) is an utter mess that merits viewing for only 2 reasons: bing introduced ""in the cool cool cool of the evening"", and its the worst (as far as i can tell) movie directed by the immortal frank capra."
4,2 ON 1,"JUST FOR YOU is mainly a vehicule for JANE WYMAN and BING CROSBY who had great chemistry together.We all know how it's gonna end and the plot is a little melodramatic.Nevertheless,it is a rather pleasant affair.After a very shaky start,HERE COMES THE GROOM becomes hilarious and shows CAPRA getting the most of all his actors.It is the only film of the fifties whose highlight is a wrestling match between two women.BING has a field day in this part and it's easy to understand why the director thought that he was a fabulous actor.The producers certainly knew that IN THE COOL,COOL,COOL OF THE EVENING was going to be a hit.If you like BING but never saw this movie,you are missing something."
5,A great book that is a must have for any nikonos owner.,"This book is great for people who are new to underwater pictures. He starts out slow, but while newbies might find that some parts are too hard to understand, old users will feel right at home. After the middle of the book everything makes sense, and the book really does help. I promise."
4,The Litanies Of Satan ~ Diamanda Galas,"Well, this is the weirdest record I own! Diamanda Galas has a voice that cannot be described. On this album there are two pieces, Wild Women With Steak-Knives and The Litanies of Satan. WWWSk features Galas screaming over and over like a madman. Her voices carries higher then I have ever heard! The Litanies Of Satan is a version of a poem by a French autor. This is a really creepy album, but if you like challenging art/music, this is the album for you!"
5,Excellent book,"This is modern, classic and excellent book on PDEs.Great for researchers and graduate students. Very well written and organized."
3,Yokota,"Although I liked the book overall, there were more than 2 or 3 times that I wished the author would get on with it. It became a little tedious, especially during the dance tour. I related very well to the lifestyle of the big family moves, military style. It was very believable."
3,A recent rediscovery from the depths of my music collection,"I thought I heard once that Alex said the quality of this release was intentionally poor, to ""scare off everyone but the true fans"" (or words to that effect). That may very well be true--""More Gills..."" and ""We're Pastie..."" still annoy me to no end, even after a few years between listens--but, as many of the other reviews here have noted, the opening track and ""Alles Ist Schoen"" still make this EP worth owning, and ""His Immortal Logness"" is still good for a laugh (especially if you hear the Orb perform it live)."
2,Tripping over trippy-ness,"2 1/2Asides for some appealing beat-driven stretches, this informative stopgap does little more than attempt to exploit a drug-inclined fanbase with long, loopy lifelessness."
4,Island ways,"Good book. Gives some good history, some firsthand, of the island before it was invaded by Hollywood types, Jaws and slippery politicians like the Kennedys and the Clintons. Island life is different from mainland life and this book spells out why. The author laments the changes though admits the poverty in the past was nothing to be nostalgic about. I found it interesting to read comments about relationship between islanders, tourists and ""summer people."" They may not understand or even like eachother, but they need eachother."
3,Poor indexing for new users,This a physically large book with lots of stuff in it. I found it difficult to find the information that I needed. The info about the administrator account did not work on my Vista Home Premium.
2,"Lots of chatter, but neglects too many nuts and bolts.","I took an afternoon and went through this book from cover to cover - admittedly not all topics drew my careful attention. Too many operational details are missing: hit this key, then go to x and enter ..... etc. In sum, although my system is up and running (and was before I bought the book), I am missing instruction on many basic operations.Try somewhere else."
3,returned,I had to return this book because the binding was broken so I really cannot attest to any more than that.
5,good/bad,"i loved the product. it was exactly what i wanted! i'm beginning a new chapter in my life, and i have been reading a few books to help me along. i was recommended this book through another book. however, my journey was put on hold when i had to wait forever for it to come in. i didnt do 2 day shipping but it usually doesnt take so long for me recieve it, however,,it took like 3 weeks. geez.."
3,"Cool technology, but what is the point?","Paying a few bucks to download a lo-fi DRM-enabled video file that requires a custom player program...what's the point?This is not for me. I'm a 33-year-old computer programmer and I simply see money spent on these downloads as money wasted. I'd much rather preview and purchase a DVD. You know, that format that you can back up and convert to play on any device you happen to own.These DRM-protected videos? Pfft. I'd rather watch Rick's re-runs on CPTV with no commercials."
2,needs a professional edit,"As a professional editor, I must agree with preceding comments--if this book was edited, I hope the publisher fires the editor. There are too many spelling and punctuation errors to count, errors with font changes (things set italic that should be roman and vice versa) and just a lot of sloppiness that should be really embarrassing to the author and publisher. I was embarrassed for them! This stuff detracts so much from the actual text of the book that it makes it virtually unusable. I hope that if it ever comes out in a second edition, they spring for a professional edit to eliminate all these problems. What should be a fun, useful book ends up being a pile of crap because of the poor (or lack of) editing."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"These copies are Lightning Source specials - a crappy print on demand publisher that is all into profit and not into quality.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, you'll be glad. Go to the library and get it instead."
3,Great for VERY young kids.,"My SpEd middle school students found this too easy & said it would be great for grades 1-3 only. NICE graphics & game & all that, but not much of a challenge."
3,"Okay, but the sex-talk was overboard","I think this could have been a much better story than it was. I liked the characters, I liked where they were going. I quickly tired of the poor communication and worse sex-talk... it actually got pretty stupid. And while the temporary break up moved the story along, the ""one-last-quickie"" scene in Rick's office was AWFUL and just stupid; who does that! Buuut... things worked out and I can skip over bad dialogue as long as there's not too much of it."
1,The only place for this book is the trash can,"I have never thrown a book away before, but this doesn't deserve to be saved. There was no plot to speak of other than a young lady that didn't like herself very much or have much confidence, and a lot of trashy dialog that most teenagers I know could have written better. Boring, badly written, this book has nothing to recommend it."
2,Much Too Vulgar,"This could have been a sweet love story were it not for the vulgar language used. I stopped reading several times but because I wanted to see how the story ended, I forced myself to finish by skipping over most of the intimate parts. The ending was a bit of a let down too. Much potential but just to vulgar too enjoy. I also chose this book thinking it was an interracial love story. Big mistake on my part. Race was barely discussed."
4,Best Deal For Money,Item works great. It also comes with the Y adapter as shown. Sounds just as good as previous more exspensive cable. Best bang for your buck.
5,Perfect for my sub,"I needed a high quality cable and Y splitter to connect my sub, so I did a lot of research and was shocked at some of the prices that were being charged for ""subwoofer cables"". The reality is that you need an RCA cable and a Y splitter for the L and R connections on the sub. There is no need to pay upwards of $50 for a cable and then have to shell out more for the adapter.These are solidly built cables. They are not cheap or flimsy and the packaging was squared away. I connected my subwoofer with no problems and I can happily report that it sounds great. I was looking for an inexpensive quality cable and an adapter and I found both of them in one easy product.The cable is exactly 6 feet and the Y adapter gives you a few more inches.Pros:Well builtPurple color on the RCA cable to match the input on the receiver (small details)priceCons:None so farI recommend these cables and advise others to save money for quality speakers and subs!"
4,Missed some of my favorites,"Very disappointed that two major selections were missing.Thought for sure that Bustopher Jones would be on the CD. Also missed Billy McCaw - the full version of Gus, the Theatre Cat.I sure would like to get the CD of the whole, unabridged London version. I saw Cats twice in London and want to relive it, if possible."
5,This is an awesome product!,My [...] LOVES to use this on her glasses. It works like a charm and I've not found a better product.The only reason it would streak is if you don't follow the directions. You have to buff the glasses with the cloth after they're done cleaning in the machine.I couldn't have asked for a better gift.
4,D-Link Wireless Qos G Router 108MBPS,"It's a nice product for the price, if considering it comes with printer server function. BUT... I connected it to my Canon Pixma IP4200, set-up as instructed, and printer does print the documents; however, there's always an annoying ""printer is offline"" banner that remains until all printing job is finished..."
3,A Good Starting Point,"'US Nuclear Weapons in Canada' is a good starting point for anyone interested in this rather obscure section of Cold War history. Though the author does not delve into sufficient detail in certain incidents, the end result is very readable. The reader, however, is often left a bit confused over some points, such as several references to a 'secret police' in Canada placing certain individuals under surveillance. It is a bit unclear whether this refers to the RCMP security service or another group. However, for anyone interested in Canadian-American relations during the Cold War, and the deployment of nuclear weapons by a nuclear power in other countries, I would recommend it."
2,Prefer Top Chef Because Not Abusive,"I hate the abusive chef in charge of this show. I realize some viewers like it in these reality shows when there are abusive people on top castigating the contenders. Project Catwalk UK also had an extremely abusive judge whom viewers loved or hated. I am rather surprised to discover that I don't like it when these people in charge are abusive, insulting, sarcastic and demeaning to the contestants. I expected to like that because it puts more drama and tension into the show. However, I didn't count on that I would be repulsed by that behavior and thus stop watching. I suspect I am in the minority here. This show is a big hit. I should say that although I can cook, I am by no means a chef. Perhaps this is what real chefs behave like which is what ups the reality factor for viewers who move in this real chef's world. For viewers like me, TOP CHEF is better where everyone who is in a superior position to the contenders is well behaved."
4,So far... so good,"We bought this to be our travel monitor but I may switch it to be the home one. I'm amazed at how light these monitors are! We have yet to use the auto feature where it plays music or a pre-recorded message when baby wakes, but the lightness and small size of these monitors alone won me over.I'm only giving 4 stars now b/c we haven't used all the features."
1,Not a Great Choice,"I have 2 of these monitors. We received the first one as a shower gift and loved it. The sound quality was great. We didn't use the pre-recorded/music option, we just liked the lights and sound quality. It lasted approximately 4 months before it just stopped working for no apparent reason. I figured something must have happened to it (like it was a lemon), so I purchased another one and it lasted 2 1/2 months before it just stopped working. It was on and I could hear the baby fine, then all of a sudden, there was static. Nothing we have done for 2 days now has made it work. I have a back up monitor (Fisher Price Dual Private Connection) that we normally use for travel (because we aren't too happy with the sound quality) that we are using now, but I wouldn't recommend it either."
2,NOT the best of wet willie,"If you really want Wet Willie's best, skip this and go for ""Drippin' Wet."""
3,A little disapointed,"My Grandmother always wore this perfume, so I bought this for my Mom for Christmas. It seems that the bottled in Paris version has a different sent than the American version."
5,a scent of Paris,"I bought this for my mother, but I must confess that I love it too! I find it irresistible."
5,Earrings to create,If you are looking for a way to express your beadwork talents in as little time as possible try making some of the earrings in this compact wonderful book.....earrings are easy to make and show off your talent!
1,Junkie,Cone was bent in shipment and cracked. Suction cup is so old that it's very hard and can't be used. I had this shipped one day and the cost was high so I'm not sending it back because of the cost. DONT BUY THIS JUNK.
5,trike cover for my honda,this is the second cover i have purchased. firs for a smaller motorcycle and nowfor the trike and both were excellent in quality and durable. thanks for theexcellent product. price was fair
5,Elegant Design,This is the triditional English tea set. It's a very lovely present for my wife. Great product and good price!
5,Das um sie Kruder & Dorfmeister,This music is perfect for sitting at home with your shoes of and the light low. Mellow and groove oriented this music make you want to light one up.
4,I enjoy all of Carol Davis Luce books in this genre,Interesting read and great price! So far all the books I have purchased on my kindle have been enjoyable and a fast read.
3,lenox tubing cutters,"as a plumber i use a tubing cutter almost every day.for the last year or so i have tried the new lenox line consisting of the migit,the 1 1/8 and tne 1 3/4.my favoite being the 1 3/4.i do like the solid construction,the smooth operation of the knob,the extra wheel and the built in reamer.these are worthy of a 5 rating.however the cutter is not as strong as a ridgid when it falls from an 8ft ladder,pushing the knob into the body making the operation never quite the same.for what they cost i expected more endurance.also wheels last about 1/2 as long as ridgid.once it gets wet it needs to be oiled very soon as well.this makes the rating a 3"
2,"""underground"" doesn't translate into quality","If these guys are so intelligent when it comes to rhymes, why is every other phrase on these tracks ""f%@! this"" and ""f$*@ that"".This cat Vinnie brags that he was one of the only white kids showing up back in the day to see Kane, Rick, and others throw down. It sure doesn't show in his rhymes or flow."
4,Another classic,"JMT are easily one of the 3 or 4 most consistent hip hop groups regularly releasing full-length albums. I was a bit dissapointed with ""Visions of Gandhi"", which was still very good, but the production was probably Stoupe's weakest effort. Of course Vinnie Paz still rocks like nobodys business, but you could see his lyrics going from the intelligent-hoodlum style of someone like Jeru tha Damaja into a more Necro-ish homophobia intermingled with how much he hates everyone. I still like Vinnie as an MC, but his lyrics were best on the first 2 albums."
3,too much from guests,"I am a huge Van fan. Van is clearly one of the best at what he has been doing for the past 30 years. That is were this album disappoints. On the ablum his guests perfom what seems to be at least half of the ablum. Not that they aren't talented, it is just that they are clearly not Van. Also I am not a big fan of medlies. I prefer No Guru, Poetic Champions and Into The Music. Next will be Its Too Late To Stop Now."
3,"Good study guide, but a few mistakes","This study guide brings out important points, but I have several mistakes. The textbook is a newer version than some of the study guide questions and answers."
2,Katie Brown Entertains,"Some of the things I look for in an entertaining or cook book are ideas that are practical and relatively easy. The recipes contained in the book are delicious, but the themes... Using a piece of sod as a placemat, or chicken wire on a table, or cups glued on the tops of hot wheels?!? A little over the top for me."
4,Excellent MP3 player,"This MP3 player is an excellent value. The music sounds good and for the amount of storage you can't beat the price. My 10 year old son loves it and finds it very easy to use. You have to install the creative software to use Windows Media Player to load songs. It is DRM compatible. It does NOT have line-in recording or an FM player like the previous Creative model. However, it is cheaper."
3,God read,The most important part I picked up from training is anticipating and not participating. It would have been better if they have more material about finding exact supply and demand levels.
2,Totally whipped...,"While I bought (and enjoyed) the Postal Service CD, I thought that it might serve as an outlet for some of the (more sensitive) leanings of our foo'ball hero Mr. Gibbard. Unfortunately, the more garage-band, guitar-based DCFC stuff (Hindsight, Song for Kelly Huckaby, Champagne From a Paper Cup) is completely missing from this album. It's an emo trainwreck, and while I enjoy a weepie just as much as the next self-assured heterosexual male, I gotta say, the DCFC boys have done better."
5,A perfect album,Albums like this come don't come around very often. Not a bad song on the lot. Amazingly good for an American band. Definately a keeper!
4,The first DCfC I've heard,"I had heard of Death Cab a while back, but first heard Soul Meets Body on the radio the other day. I was interested enough to go out and buy the CD yesterday. I've listened to it a couple of times now, so this review is based on that amount of exposure.Plans sounds like a mix of Coldplay's sort of dreamy, melodic vocalizations and American Analog Set's mesmerizing style of repetition. Nothing on this CD rises far above the rest in terms of songs that you can't get out of your head, at least not after only a couple of listens. If you're willing to go along, though, Plans is a 45 or so minute joy ride. That alone is worth the price of admission.Plans is interesting enough that I will be checking out their older material in the near future. For a band that has just made the leap to a major label, that has to be good to hear."
2,Boring and overproduced!!!,"Let's get right to it: This cd is slow and boring and overproduced. Positivie reviewers might call it ""melancolic and soulful""...but it is boring. I'm a Death Cab fan and I wanted so badly to like it...but I just can't. It makes me sleepy everytime I listen to it. If you are expecting any of the semi-upbeat sound of Transatlant...you will not find it here.My suggestion, save your money or spend it on Arcade Fire's cd called Funeral!!!"
2,RIP Death Cab RIP,"One of my favorite bands of all time has just gone major label and the outcome is just horrible. Anyways I shouldn't blame their major label jump entirely - I had a feeling that Transatlanticism was their first step downwards. May they rest in peace.BTW, they have ruined the song ""Stability"" (one of my favorite DCFC songs of all time) completely with their new version ""Stable Song""."
3,What you've come to expect,"Decent follow up and definitely not a dissappointment. However, not their best...It should appeal to new fans and OCers as it is a very accessible album. Too polished and expected in my opinion but I still recommend it to all DCFC fans. Gibbards songwriting is exactly what you've come to appreciate from him, which is a good thing. I'd like to see them stretch themselves a bit as any of the songs on this album would easily fit within Transatlanticism."
2,zzzzzzzzzzz,"These guys were, at best, a servicable college rock band in their early days, but as they've forged on and ""up"" the lyrics and music have just gotten really tired and, honestly, difficult for me not to laugh at their lame songs... And the fact that they've spawned a bunch of imitators that are just as insufferable only reinforces the notion that this lame emo-ish bandwagon is best kept off of."
3,Over rated and over-hyped,"The album is not bad. Couple good songs here or there. This probably is their most consistant album to date.BTW, I can't see why anyone is invoking Postal Service. Death Cab is much more, um, organic.I guess the best thing this about this album is that they've kept politics out of the album.We really don't need another tiresome leftwing tirade."
5,"Beautiful, meaningful, haunting....perfect.","Once in a while an album comes along that speaks to you and just makes so much sense. It becomes a soundtrack to that moment in time and causes you to reflect on your life and memories that are important to you. Plans is a masterwork for DCFC. Each track weaves a beautiful web, touching on the themes of life, love and death. After the delicate Transatlanticism and the richer and rewarding Plans one can only anticipate where this very talented band is heading in the future."
4,Plans,"Plans being Death Cab For Cutie's 2005 release and their 5th studio album was a hit both amongst most the critics and the public by getting generally good reviews and peaking at #4 on the Billboard 200. They released three singles from the album, these being ""Soul Meets Body"", ""Crooked Teeth"" and ""I Will Follow You into the Dark"". The booklet includes all the lyrics and the cover is ok but I must say that I do not understand the meaning of the photo. 4/5."
1,I will not follow you into the dark,"Perhaps the worst part of the entire album is on, ""I will follow you into the dark.""In Catholic school as vicious as Roman ruleI got my knuckles bruised by a lady in blackAnd I held my tongue as she told me""Son fear is the heart of love""So I never went backEvery time I hear it I cringe. The entire album is a little too affective, even for emo rock. Marching bands of Manhattan is an ok track, and What Sarah Said is also not bad. Brothers on a hotel bed is the most immediately catchy song, but it gets old, and you realize it's really a mediocre to bad song. I'm not a huge fan of Death Cab for Cutie, if you are, you might like this album better than I did. Their best song is still photobooth."
1,an open letter to dcfc,"please stop writing songs for 14 year white girls. (no offense if you are from said demographic, but no nation turns its lonely eyes to you for any opinion, just good excess spending). i know it's hard to turn money away, but as a formerly die-hard fan, i am a bit hurt (as are many) by this transgression and am filing an amicus for recompense."
4,What did you expect?,"Death Cab is a band that while evolving, has maintained an original sound. To me, they are the most consistent talented band in the indie rock scene today. And I can't think of another band that sounds like them. It's weird because i really wanted to try to find a current band like them. In the 90s, I was listening to Texas is the reason, Promise Ring, Sunny Day, etc and I guess Death Cab fell into that category of music, but now I have become a lot more open to other types of music including a lot of independent hip hop artists such as Aesop, and MF doom as well as experimental artists like Sigur Ros and Explosions in the Sky, and I can say that Death Cab is still one of my favorite bands. My favorite tracks off this cd are ""Your Heart is an Empty Room"" and ""Different Names for the Same Thing"". If you liked Transatlanticism, you'll like this because it feels like a good sequel to that cd. 4 stars, thanks"
5,"Great cups - don't stain, cool to touch!","Bought them in a local store. Have had them for about 6 months - Awesome. No stains with coffee, tea. Cup is nice to touch and does not heat up in a microwave (only heats contents). Before I used to buy Corelle but from now on it's going to be Lenox Butterfly."
5,Wife loves them,She had thought she might 'like' them. After I bought her a set (4) she thinks they are fantastic. Uses one every morning.
3,The only movie I ever walked out in the middle.,"If your are big into tap, you will like this. It just wasn't my cup of tea if you will. It just went on and on with no end in sight."
4,Worth a graphic designer's time,"It's very easy to find a font for any given project with this guide. It is organized by theme and emotional content . . . looking for a fun font or a kids font or a fantasy font? There are several recommendations for each section. My only complaint about this book is that I would like to see each section expanded with further suggestions. If you find a theme that works for you then, most likely, you will only find 2-3 pages of suggested fonts. It's a great concept for a book. Hopefully, the author will release additional editions at some later date."
4,Yay,"Hans LOVED this thing. I bought it a while ago, and we still have most of it. HAns is a lovebird and this was the perfect size for him. He liked to sit under it and chew."
3,Not compatable with Windows 7,"Although Windows 7 says that this version can be installed in compatibility mode, it doesn't seem to work. This isn't this merchants fault."
5,Fun bargain priced party accessory,"Excellent vendor experience. Quality matches the price. These were a bargain, and fit the bill as fun party koozies. Great party favors for any party."
3,Conclusion of family saga,"This is the fourth and final book in the Texas series, which chronicles the life of the wealthy Coleman family. Billie is the main character in the first book of the series and she is again featured in this last book as she nears death. Some of the female members of the family are in bad marriages and the young males seem unsure of their ability to be head of the family fortune. This book often seems formulaic and some situations are forced into the plot rather than coming with the natural flow of what has occurred before. There are loose ends which are too easily tied up and there are some plot lines, such as the airplane that Sawyer is designing, which are left hanging. The earlier characters were much more interesting which is another reason that this book is not as good as the ones that came before. If you are a die-hard fan of the series, read this one by all means, but just don't expect it to be as good as the rest."
4,Judy's review of Texas Sunrise,Good ending for a great series. The Coleman family grabs your interest from the start. Michaels makes you feel as though you are part of this dynamic family. A great read!
5,One of my all-time childhoold favorites!,"This has been one of my favorites ever since I was little (and I never had an extreme attachment to a blanket, stuffed animal, etc.). I still have my original copy, although it's very tattered and hard to read (with the cover and pages coming apart). I'm now purchasing a new copy for my daughter. I highly recommend this for any little girl."
2,Well-organized yet error-ridden guide to MLPs,"The ""Complete Checklist,"" unfortunately, is very disappointing. It certainly would be helpful for beginners who have little idea of how ponies fit into sets; however, this information is available for free online. The primary disappointment is the staggering number of errors. I opened the book and immediately found dozens of ponies listed with the wrong ribbon colors and the wrong types and colors of brushes. Petty stuff, yes, but the whole point of the book really. And I only really know years 1-3, and there are TEN years of original MLP, so imagine how many errors I didn't even catch. Ms. DePiano is no expert in my opinion, despite her alleged lifetime of MLP lovin'."
4,Good,It does keep bread from turning stale but it is not easy to clean as it is not machine washable. Have to rinse it with vinegar and water and then air dry it. I am too busy and don't have time for this. If you neglect to wash it any bread you put in the bag molds in no time.
1,This isn't Christian Fiction!,I finally realized why this book was disturbing me...not quite right. Half way through I figured it out. This author must be LDS and sure enough. Come on...I want my money back. This book was misrepresented as being Christian.
5,Great Concert,"If anyone ever wanted to know why this man's work is considered legendary, simply watch and listen to this concert on dvd, especially the bonus tracks. One will come away with a true understanding of his talent. The only thing better would have been at the concert in person, but the dvd is well done and captures the performace well. David"
5,Works in the UK,I don't know why this has not been released in the UK. I got fed up waiting for it and the US version works fine.
1,What's wrong with this sound?,"There is either a problem with the production of this DVD or the actual recording. There is no music nor vocals coming out of the right front channel in Dolby Digital 5.1 mode. There is some sound coming out of that channel, but it is only ambient audience noise, similar to what you would hear on some rear channels. I am certain that this is not a problen related to my audio equipment, since I tried it on 3 different DVD/AVR setups. I am a huge Van Morrison fan (have every one of his albums/CD's) and therefore was very dissappointed to hear this recording. Anyone else experience this problem? Shame on the responsible parties who put out such an inferior product for such a great artist."
1,not some of his best that I have heard,My first taste of buying van morrison and It was not the best for my tastes. Its hard for me to understand what he is singing but that is somewhat his style. the orchastra that was with him was very good.
4,Van THE MAN,"It was great to see VM perform this classic album.If you're hoping to see some magic?, it is there,though the youthfulness of the original recordingis not there, this is mature Van, with those great songs!Loved watching the show and hearing those songsthat have stirred many a soul who have heard the originalAstral Weeks."
1,Pilates for Pink Workout,I reviewed this before. The DVD was hard to view because it had a large scratch in it. The vendor would only refund my money if I removed my negative review. I am still waiting for a decision on my refund. Please look into this for me. Thank you
4,Rooly easy!,"Good for me - just starting out on guitar. Loved the anecdotes - amazing that he can remember so much about when he recorded it all!Might not be so rewarding for experienced guitar players as I think these are ""dumbed down"" versions but true to it's title."
4,Whadda trip,"My brother picked this up for me a few years back, and I have been listening to it since! Its a mix of funk beat - jazz with some philosophical undertones. This is a CD that demandes solitude.Great piece of work!"
5,Nothing Else Like It,"This album has been one of my all time favorite listening experiences. While every other track has wonderful attributes for ambiance/background, the all time #1 song that I quote the most is ""Words of Advice"", almost daily. This is the only album that I have purchased more than once, my first copy was a gift, I bought another when I lost the first, I gave away my third copy and just bought my fourth."
4,"Excellent ""WAR 101"" film","This documentary puts it all in perspective-- easy to connect the dots, even for those who don't wish to know.It should be required viewing for high school and college students AND for citizens of the U.S."
5,Another Great EliZe Song!,"I didn't think EliZe could have another song as good as ""Shake,"" but I was wrong. ""Automatic,"" with it's soaring beat and super catchy chorus, is bound to be a smash hit wherever it's released. Her new album ""Rhythm of Love"" is due to be released soon, and if most of the songs sound like this one and ""Shake,"" it should sell more copies than Britney Spears and Kylie Minogue combined. There should be no hesitation about this one - add to cart, you won't be sorry!"
2,poor quality,Gave this as a birthday present. When he opened it was falling apart due to poor assembly and gluing. Had to take brand new present to my woodworking shop to do what should have been done at the factory
4,Chess Set,"This a great travel chess set. It cleans up easily and the pieces stay on the board. Usually travel sets like this do not look very good, but this chess set looks great."
5,Still a classic,"This was one of my first cds, purchased when ""In the House of Stone and Light"" was played on the radio. 13 years later it's still one of my favorite CDs. The melodies and lyrics are so moving. I'm sad to see that it's gone out of print, but considering how inexpensive used copies are, if you enjoy adult contemporary you'll find this well worth the few dollars shipping. Also sad that there was never a follow-up, considering the high quality of this work."
1,corny,"This has to be one of the worse books I have ever read. It is so corny and unrealistic, and anyone that has to add animal cruelty into their story and think it is funny has issues. I do not recommend this book at all. This was a Kelly Ripa book club book, which does not surprise me."
1,HORRIBLE,Sorry this book is horrible. I didn't make it past 30ish pages. I like British chick lit as much as the next gal but this was really awful. Not an interesting writing style and not very interesting characters.
3,"Good, But Searching for Gems!","I read For Better, For Worse because Kelly Ripa recommended it. Okay, so maybe that's not the best reason to pick up a book, but I thought it might be a fun, late summer read before the kids go back to school. And it was. I enjoyed this book and it made me laugh, made me remember strange and funny things in my past relationships. And then I took a previous reviewer's advice and checked out Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin. I read the Prologue online, sensed there was something deep inside and was hooked. It connected with me and OMG was the ending incredible. Amazing how a 'good' book like For Better, For Worse gets so much publicity but you end missing gems like Shade of the Maple or Tending Roses by Lisa Wingate. Hope Kelly's next pick has a little more punch."
4,Loved it until the end,"The book was great, funny, and interesting! I liked the fact that it kept you hanging on until the end and was still a book about romance. There were some parts that i could do without like the duck chase, but it was good none the less. The end wasn't what i expected though. I felt it was left unfinished, maybe a follow up book could be good!?"
2,Wrong couple???,"I have to admit that I did like the book, in terms of the writing style. However, the ending was so abrupt and unbelievable. I wanted to know what happened with their relationship after those first five minutes back together. Also, I think Matt should have ended up with Holly, since he spent more time with her than the heroine of the book! Are we really supposed to believe that he's in love with Josie after everything he did with Holly?!?! You can probably tell that I was annoyed by this book A LOT, but it was funny!"
2,Over The Top,"We meet Josie Flynn a soon to be divorcee, who is just starting to get over her divorce from Damien. For her winter vacation from work she is headed to New York for her cousin Martha's wedding. While on the plane, she is seated next to the charming and handsome Matt, the rock journalist, who is also recently divorced. They share their horror stories, and seem to becoming friends. Once they land in NY they decided to meet for an afternoon at the Statue of Liberty. After this point the book serisoulsy goes down hill. We are then treated to a cat and mouse game while Matt is looking for Josie. Throw into the mix an unbelievably lavish wedding, an affair (or 2 depending how you look at it), an ex husband who comes toting an expensive gift to win back Josie's affection, and a duck and it make a very unbelievable book."
1,Poor product,"Bought this mirror at target, along with many other Eddie Bauer baby products available there. This mirror is hard to install, and everytime you hit a bump it falls down, rendering it useless. It is just very poorly made from cheap materials. I am very disappointed with the Eddie Bauer line at Target. Almost every Eddie Bauer product I bought ended up breaking in a week or I just returned due to such poor design. Target needs to stop selling these items, they are a waste of money."
1,does not work with Camary,"This product is no good. Does not work with my 1997 Camary. Floppy, poorly constructed. The only upside is that it is an actual mirror not plastic. The other Eddie Bauer Delux model is even worse (not a real mirror and more $$) Skip this propduct."
4,Pretty good,"It's ok for the price, but I found the cups to be a bit big. Otherwise, it is nice and long so you don't get a weird line where it ends."
4,Great Purchase,"I bought this for my wedding, and I really loved it. Its not too tight, but it does help. I would definetely suggest this product. And the design is beautiful."
5,Best skillet I've ever owned,"this is the best skillet I have ever owned. I've been using this skillet for about a month now and find it to be the best. The height and angle of the handle is great. The handle never gets hot. The pan itself is nonstick and supposedly dishwasher safe (I still haven't put it in the dishwasher, I always hand wash it). The only issue might be that it's too heavy to lift with one hand for some people."
1,Word of Warning,"This is NOT the Juliana Hatfield, et. al. group also named Some Girls. If that's what you are expecting, as I was, you will be disappointed."
1,Ugh,"I am a huge Steve Earle fan and am sad to say that this album pretty much stinks. Steve is capable of creating great music, but this was obviously just slapped togther to try to generate sales in advance of the 2004 election. Neither the music nor the message are interesting or compelling. After string of great records like ""Train a' Comin',"" ""I Feel Alright,"" ""El Corazon,"" and ""The Mountain,"" Steve seems to have lost his interest in creating great music and instead wants to rage against the system. That would be OK with me if he would devote more time and energy into the music that accompanies the message. Here, it is clear he did not do that. A big disappointment."
4,Excellent,"Didn't Care for it much the first few spins, but grew on me big time. I listened to the old stuff (Guitar Town, Exit 0, Copperhead Road, The Hard Way) 'til the groves wore off. I appreciate this newer music more though. Takes a lot of guts to make a record that says something. Some people forget that some of (if not all of) the best music was built on anger and controversy - an actual message. F the CC is the best. If you believe these establishments should go pound sand, why hold back? They don't. Really loved the live show. It's when you see Steve sing and talk about the songs and the message, you see it's not hype and grandstanding for attention - it's for real and that's what makes this such a good album. Never be afraid to speak your mind, and to hell with the nilly willy's."
4,Flawed but worth the price,"Is it perfect? No. Is it important? Yes. Rushed? You bet. Is it country? Is it rock & roll? The answer to both is not really. For the most part a very good CD, except for Condi Condi, which I now just program out. But the CD is much better than the version of Home to Houston rushed to radio stations that was mixed so poorly the lyrics were unitelligable.To those complaining about the political content, Hey you know what you're getting when you buy it. If you want right wing, buy Ted Nugent."
5,The Year's Most Important Album,"This may be the most important rock and roll record made since Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young recorded Ohio three and a half decades ago. Nobody will ever accuse Earle of being objective, but he certainly is passionate, and that's more important. He does get playful on Condi, Condi, and romantic with Emmylou Harris on Comin' Around, but the heart of this record is in the title cut, as well as within the tracks Home To Houston and Rich Man's War, both of which describe the helplessness of the men and women who have been put in the line of fire overseas. Whether you agree with Earle's idealogy or not, we ARE supposed to be living in a democracy, where the exchange of ideas is a good thing. Unfortunately, there aren't too many artists out there with the fire and eloquence of Mr. Earle.If you hear one record from 2004, this should be it."
4,Really Good,"When I first picked this book up from my school library I thought, Eh. Little did I realize how good it was! At first it was very confusing, very hard to understand the language used back then, but the plot is so good and humorous! I loved it!"
5,DAMN YANKEES,"LOVE THE CD, BRAND NEW AND REMINDS ME OF WHEN I SAW THE CLOSING SHOW WITH JERRY LEWIS ON BROADWAY. THE PRICE WAS GREAT AND SO WAS THE SERVICE. THANKS A BUNCH FOR A GREAT CD"
3,Point of Information,"Sorry -- didn't see the musical. (I'm a Yankee fan!)I just wanted to clarify the angst over Joe (apparently) circling the bases during his transformation back to a middle-aged man -- rather than catching the final out.Or at least give an explanation.In the original novel, Joe DID hit a HR. However, while he was circling the bases, he began transforming back to his mortal self. Gasping and wheezing, Joe crawled his way across home plate."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"The sound quality is so bad you feel like you're listening to something out of a tin can. The picture is great, but the sound is hard to overcome. The audio is digital dolby - not stereo. We are going to return it and pay the 15% restocking fee for something with better sound quality."
4,VERY GOOD!,"This is a very good analysis of Churchill, a thorough and colorfull portrait of a man I consider to be the greatest man of the 20th century. I have only two complaints, first I would have liked to have known more about his life with his wife and children. I also would have liked to have known what he thought of the Lusitania sinking. Not only does Manchester say nothing about Churchill's role in this business but the word Lusitania is not mentioned at all in nearly 2000 pages. Very strange. The letters of Churchill point out the chivalrousness and romantic nature that the public has not seen. All in all - very good and well worth a good read."
5,A BRILLIANT BIOGRAPHY - WELL DONE!,"This is a brilliantly written biography of one of the most fascinating characters in history. Like most of Mnchester's work (I must admit to being a big fan), this is a very readable biography, well researched and holds the reader's interest from page to page. We see so much of Churchhill in his role as a WWII leader that we tend to forget there was a young man, living, learning and growing before the back and white films we see today. It is good to be reminded of this from time to time. It is also, for those interested, to learn how a world leader of Churchill's calibre came into being, how he developed and why he was the way he was. This work gives us great insight to those questions. Cannot recommend this work highly enough."
5,Excellent--Almost as good as WSC's Marlborough,"Excellent book. Interesting to read along with other British histories including Churchill's own. His personality can be understood better by reading about his mother, Jennie Jerome (Lady Randollph Churchill; Mrs. George Cornwallis-West). Her Autobiography contains many pictures--she was truly beautiful and interesting."
5,Another old time favourite,"Being a Bob Hope fan I love pretty much every movie he's in, but I would have to say this is probably my favourite next to The Paleface. Lucille Ball is a great co-star in this laugh all the way though movie. There's nothing bad to say about it. The storyline is funny and easy to follow, great characters and casting and more catchy songs throughout, my favourite would have to be the one in the kitchen where they are singing about 'home cooking'. Overall this is definitly one the whole family could watch and enjoy"
4,Thanks for the Memories,"Bob Hope and Lucy Ball what a team; only those of us baby boomers can appreciate the humor and fun these two created. I enjoyed every fun loving minute this movie had to offer. my teenage kids on the other hand walk out after about the first half hour, ""what do they know anyway"". This movie is for those of us who remember that funny doesn't have to come with those nasty four letter words to get a laugh out of you. I recommend this product to adults and fun loving kids who can appreciate clean humor."
5,Fancy Pants DVD,"The DVD arrived before I expected it, in perfect condition. It's exactly what I've been looking for, at a great price!"
5,A GREAT BOOK FOR A CRAPPY ECONOMY,"I read Tim Sander's other cool books, but missed this one. How did that happen. I love Tim Sanders!In this crappy economy this is the kind of book that can really cheer you up. Only Tim Sanders can talk about 'lovecats' and get away with it. We smile when we read it, but we know he's right.The messages are simple, they are all about relationships and learning how to build rapport with others. In tough times you need your network. As the CEO of the US Chamber, Tom Donohue says, ""sometimes you will find yourself leaning on your network, and your network will expect the same of you."" Read this book for inspiration during tough times and then go out and build better business relationships and repair broken ones."
3,Unique personal model ownable only by the author,"It looks like all our friend does is rehash knowledge of others, repackages it smartly. I found little to no true empowering thoughts. His model only suits him or those that want to enter the speaker circuit. Try implementing it in the REAL world in your work - you'll lose your shirt faster than you can blink."
1,there should be negative stars,"i've taken the time to read these reviews (in addition to having read the book). i find it shocking that some reviewers rated this anything above two stars. tim sanders presents zero material that is original or truly helpful. i got to believe that positive reviews are coming from people who are personal friends of sanders, cultish fools easily bedazzled by snake oil salesmen, or dimwits who read people magazine as literary art."
5,Mentor in a Box,"Through this book, Tim Sanders has achieved the status of Mentor. After running my own business for seven years or so, I recently rejoined the corporate world. It's been a struggle for me to try to acclimate to what feels to me a very ""uncreative"" and idea hostile environment. Tim's lovecat theory has given me a new way to view my situation. I can create a better environment around me by passing on the things I've learned to those who can benefit - and want to benefit. Sharing knowledge to help others will turn you into someone other people want to be around. In other words, don't share knowledge just to prove how much you know. Choose the right person, time and context, and the love will happen. The book is very inspiring and motivating, and never condescending. It will also inspire a few laughs. This is one of those rare books that would benefit and appeal to anyone with a job."
5,Right on target,"""Love is The Killer App"" is one of those rare books that helps the reader to see what was always there, but perhaps invisible. As Tim points out, building the intangibles of knowledge, network and compassion and then giving them away is the path to success in today's fast-paced, information driven and love-starved business environments. This book is a gem that should sit in everyone's library.Joe Santana,Coauthor Manage I.T."
5,Read it. Love it. Apply it!,"This is a great book. Very easy going, and easy to devour. There are other books with this message, but it is worth reading. Lots of great points a 'pearls' to take with you. I already believed, and teach this philosophy, but I still got ideas and ""aha's"" from it. It also changed the way that I perceive the word ""love"" (in a good way)."
4,worth the time,"Sanders says this at the start:times are changing and professionals need to find a way to maintain their value.So,how do you do it?Sanders tells you that you network,network,network and cues you into a secret:you don't need to be a backslapper to do it, or a schmoozer, or a a sham.Just yourself.The book is only a little over 200 pages,and you can get through it in a weekend.While the Austin Powers lingo can distract ,the book is useful for all professionals trying to keep and expand their value."
4,Ideas to take with you throughout your career,"Tim Sanders shows you how and why work place intimacy should not be avoided. Many corporate cultures have created cold environments for their employees. This does a tremendous amount of disservice. If everyone would become a Love Cat, the business world would be more productive and frankly much more enjoyable. I have also embraced his concept of reading books that will expand your mind and augment your career. Taking the knowledge of what you have recently read and passing it on to another individual or incorporating it into a project is key. He offers concepts and practices that anyone can employ to generate the relationships and the impact one wants within their career."
4,The invisible currency of Love,"This is the type of book that makes you think throughout the day. It reminds you of the importance of shaking a hand, of making a call to help out a friend, of smiling to acknowledge the entrance of a new guy in the company. It's the stuff that you're too busy to remember when we walk around blowing smoke out of our ears like an overheated robot. It's a great book on business and love etiquette and it will improve the way you communicate with your peers and make them not only business acquaintances but bizfriends, who are ultimately the ones who help you the most and give you the most business."
2,What Happened?,"Being a big fan of Mellencamp for years, I was taken aside by this album. The reason I don't like it is not because it did not produce any hits, but I just felt it was very depressing and boring. I love John when he tackles gritty subjects, but on this album he seems to focus on matching the depressing message with bland untextured, boring melodies. Try another album, any other album!"
1,Disappointed,"If all you want to see is Rudy drinking and dining in Germany, this is for you. I was hoping to actually see some relevant sites in Germany other than beer halls and restaurants."
1,Ranting and Single-Minded Paranoia,"This book again proves that one can be intelligent and well-meaning, but fearfully paranoid and misguided. While the general concept of governmental abuse of power does indeed loom over us all in the ""Information Age"", the case Marrs attempts comes off as poorly executed. The book is, in my humble opinion, unbalanced and not well-written. Your dollars are better spent elsewhere."
5,Great Case....understand what your getting,This is my second nine hundred case and I like them. Understand there are better cable management systems and no dust covers are drawbacks. If you catch it on sale (less the $60) its a good deal.
5,Awesome gaming case,"I built my desktop computer using one of these cases a few years back. It has enough fans to keep my computer cool, it has enough space for large graphics cards, and it was pretty easy to install all the hardware inside. As my case is older, it only has usb 2.0, but the newer ones have 3.0. I have also noticed that some of the antec 900's have a metal grate on the back for airflow, while others actually have two rubber tube or hose holders so that you could add water-cooling. This might be a difference between versions, but my version only has the grate. Mounting the hardware inside was pretty easy and I have no complaints about that. The fans are pretty quiet, unless you have all of them set on high, which really just makes the noise more noticeable.Overall, a very solid case, and I would definitely buy one again."
4,"Great case, but you gues need to lower the price","Great case, well said: Pros:This case has amazing cooling capacity. Not only does it come with one 200mm fan but also with 3 120mm fans: all with blue LEDs. The fans themselves are quite even on full speed; especially when compared to a processor fan. The processor will always over-spin the case fans creating excess noise; however, with the cooling capabilities of the case my CPU fan now runs at lower speeds. There are access ports for USB and sound conveniently located at the top of the case which which is an added bonus. In addition, the case is aesthetically pleasing and built sturdy.Cons: You guys need to come to the future, the case is no way near this price, please lower it if you want it to sell, wake up and lok around ."
4,Hard to replace top mounted fan.,"I bought this case over a year ago much to the envy of my room mate at the time. I have had really no issues with this case, my only concern long-term will be if the top mounted fan ever goes it will be a bit of a challenge to disassemble the case to replace it. Antec needs to address this I feel and use standard screws as with older cases.For those that do own this case another quick tip for reducing dust going in through the front, scotch-brit pads. I found the standard sizes from local grocery stores fits nicely in the front since the sides are raised up. As dust builds up it collects on the scotch-brit pads instead of going into the case. Simple remove, rinse and replace. I plan on using the same method for the side, currently no fan but lots of dust build up. This prevents me from having to open the case as often and clean my Zalman CPU fan which builds up dust quite quickly."
4,Meandering narrative: not a bad thing,"I agree objectively with a previous reviewer's observation that this book weaves between story, history, and philosophy, but disagree that this quality detracts from the overall narrative. I think this meandering style of writing is one of the best approaches used in natural history writing. And while this book isn't really a natural history, the style works well for showcasing Jim Hamm's own personal history of his Texas ranch, the history of that areas peoples, and his land/hunting ethic. So don't expect a normal work of fiction here, true, but something different and engaging in it's own unique way."
5,One Of The Few Good Trek Books Out There,"Finally a book that delves into the history of the mysterious Romulans. The story deals soley with Dr. McCoy, has he is inadvertantly captured by Romulans and taken to Romulous. McCoy is kept at a Romulan Cmdr's home until he can be tried for his crimes against the empire. While incarcerated, he learns about Romulan history, which acts as the main story in the book. We learn about how the Romulans were the off shoots of Vulcans, the dissention between Surak, and those Vulcans that didn't hold Logic as the way out of Vulcan's bloody and violent past. The story opens many doors into the minds of a little explored race in the Star Trek universe."
4,Scarlett Johansson is good,"I am a Scarlett Johansson fan and that is why I bought the movie and she did not disappoint me. This is much better than her performance in the Spider thriller/comedy movie. But this movie suffers from a script that was not thought all the way though and it needed more work on it before they went to production. Still, this is one of the first movies where Scarlett starts to show herself as a superstar. In fact she actually does a little bit of acting, rather then to just have that reflective lost in translation look on her face."
5,Great sounds from ex-Wire-guitarist,"""Ab Ovo"" ist the best album from Bruce Gilbert and probably the best way to become acquainted to the innovative output of the former Wire-guitarist. It offers a great variety of styles, sounds and moods and contains quiet ambient-landscapes, disturbing electronic noises and psuedo-techno-rhythms. The mostly short pieces are based around the albums core, the 24 mins. title track. ""Ab Ovo"" is a great listening adventure for those generous enough to give it ears, and it is preferable to ""In Esse"", the chaotic and almost unlistenable album that followed."
5,Absolutely wonderful.,"Usually I just read romance novels because they are fast paced and an easy read. But once in a while there's a romance novel that transcends the obligatory sex scenes and standard plots. I don't know what it was in particular that made me LOVE this book so much; but while I was reading it, I never wanted it to end. The humor in this book is incredible (it's a rare thing for a novel to make me actually roll with laughter), and every scene made me smile (well... except for the ""suspenseful"" parts).I have read A. Quick before, but this one tops them all."
2,boring,"I had high hopes for this book. I love reading books with the same concept of scarred male lead falls in love with the lady, etc. I was bored, skimmed the last 200 pages. Don't waste your time reading this book, there are so many other much better books with the same concept."
5,Simply WOW,"I can't see this book receiving anything less than 5 stars! I really love this story. When I finish it, I had to read it again. (mind you I have have lots of other books to read) but I found myself transported into this era. WOW what a trip. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who believes in love."
4,"""She had summoned the Beast of Blackthorne Hall back to Upper Biddleton.""","Plot:Harriet summons the Earl to Upper Biddleton to deal with the horrid thieves in her fossil cave. One thing leads to another and they're married. Who knew marriage to a Rector's Daughter could be so exciting, or fraught with such danger?Comments:- Historical (Regency-ish), English, Romance.- 406 pages, 5457 kindle locations- m/f - reasonably frequent but not explicit. Caring.Opinion:A somewhat superficial romance with a fun storyline and sweet HEA. It's a nice easy read. The discussion of fossils and fossil explorers was both reasonably accurate and a colourful addition to the standard Taming Of The Beast theme. It works. It makes me smile. It's definitely worth a go.Aside:Every time St Justin became flustered with Harriet I was reminded if the children's book ""Harriet, You'll Drive Me Wild!"". Pulled me a little from the story; not the author's fault but sometimes memories and associations are triggered...-CR-"
1,Did I try to read the same book?,"I feel guilty even attempting to write a review since I could not get past the first 4 chapters. The female lead, Harriet, was an idiot and I could not even tolerate her character. I finally put the book in the ""garage sale"" box and moved on... I hate giving up on a book but in this case I had no choice."
1,Very Disappointed With This Item,"Perhaps I'm dense but I cannot figure out how the strainer plug works. Without the plug (and even with it) the fat gets into the spout, and if the fat doesn't come out the spout on pouring, it comes out thru the top."
5,Cool Baby Apehangers,"If you have a classic cruiser and want to pimp it out a bit I recommend these bars. They also make your cruiser even more comfy because you sit up even more and for me any way, I feel like I have more control. The classic cruiser bars were hitting my knees in tight corners and I feel I have much more control with these bars. Two thumbs up."
2,Mostly the same songs....again (sigh).,"Cass Elliot's first two albums are rereleased here along with some B-sides and previously unreleased material such as ""Darling, Be Home Soon,"" ""Sisotowbell Lane,"" and ""For As Long As You Need Me."" ""Different"" and ""All For Me'"" are released on this CD also, and to my knowledge this is the only CD that they have ever been released on. My main complaint is the price. Even though I paid for it for the unreleased songs, it is obvious that the record companies are trying to ""stick it"" to the consumer. Most people aren't going to pay $50.00 for one CD. The unreleased material is so-so at best. It is up to you whether or not you want to spend the money on this CD. I won't even bother asking why they won't release the entire ""The Road Is No Place For A Lady"" on CD yet."
3,Would not buy again.,"Although this product is worth the thirteen dollars I paid for it. The quality was poor, as others have reported. I would not buy it again. You get only what you pay for."
5,Love It!,My one year old loves this! She'll play for hours on it or with it and has decided it's her new favorite place to nap. It's great on hardwood floors. And even my dogs like to lay on it!
2,A romance or something else?,"Well, in this book, trying to catch a killer completely detracted from the main story, which is supposed to be the love between the heroes. But I didn't see any love. There was just... some lust? And being trapped together in strange circumstances? Well, nothing I couldn't do without. Two stars for the main characters, though."
5,Using Photoshop CS2 1on1 as a Classroom Text,"At Proctor Academy (9-12 private high school in Andover, NH) we're using Deke McClelland's Photoshop CS2 1on1 as the text in both our major (graded) and skills (pass-fail) Photoshop classes. The combination of videos illustrating the major points in each chapter followed by tutorials explaining and reinforcing those points has been very effective with our student population, many of whom are visual learners."
4,Double gift,Purchased as a gift card holder for Christmas to use later as a photo holder. Stand is very sturdy but not sure if pedals will hold gift cards as well as it will photo's. Nice size and seems to be well made.
5,Excellent Resource,Great resource and absolute must have for high school science teachers. It provides activities and great methods to teach statistics and how to conduct scientific research.
2,"Worked, but didn't hold in place","I bought this product to took my ipod up to my laptop which only has USB input and not firewire. It worked but as soon as i placed the ipod down on my desk at a certain angle, the computer would stop recognizing it. It only worked when i held the ipod upright with my hand. I had to send it back. this may have been a single-time defect, but who knows? if anyone else has had simmilar problems, kindly notify me."
2,Did Not Receive What I Ordered,"I specifically ordered Durvet brand permethrin 10%, 32 oz. This is the brand I have always used for my horses. I paid more because the product was fulfilled by amazon.com, a website I trust. It was delivered quickly but I did not open it immediately. I opened it yesterday and the brand I ordered is not the brand I received.I was sent a different brand, which may or may not work as well. I am very disappointed with this state of affairs but I have no alternative."
2,Huh?,"Fred Sokolow is a good player, but a poor teacher. The lessons pretty much go like this: ""Here's a song, now you play it."" No technique. No fingering. No parsing to show construction. The songs are good, however, so if you are able to learn by watching near full tempo playing without much help, you might get something out of this DVD."
2,NOT THIS BOOK< BELIEVE ME,this book is unuseful for anything believe meand it has no taps (listening) and no answersbuy everything and it may be useful 60%i see that barron is better specially this book made in the 1995 but barron is update
2,So so,"I bought used book. It didn't erase words that were in the book. I have to do it!! Some pages used a pen, so I couldn't do any things on it."
2,Can I choose an unedited Choose Me?,"I was disappointed that eight minutes of great erotic love scenes, the best part of the film, were edited out of the video version. There is a lot of cruel labeling and stereotyping of David Carradine's character. Don't people with mental disabilities have enough obstactles in employment, marriage et cetera without the media's often criminal stereotypes? Add two stars for the unedited version of this film."
2,Not too bad...,"Got this because of Genevieve Bujold. When she first came on the scene, she was beautiful. And I liked her. She did not age gracefully. And her acting became mediocre. I don't know what happened..."
3,The title says it all!,"This CD has some rockin' songs and a great live ambience for which I would have given it 5 stars, but the sound quality is abysmal so this would rate it only one star. Admittedly they don't try to hide it, given the title, so I have taken the average and given it 3 stars.I would recommend the album ""Cockadoodledon't"" for a better introduction to this band."
1,Poor Quality! Do not fall for this!,"I ordered this based on the reviews and have never been so dissapointed! I washed these 1 time on the wash clothes have twisted because of poor construction and the towels edging has come loose fo now they are frayed.I would return except it costs more than it's worth! PLease, save you rmoney and forget about these cheap towels."
4,Good Guitar for the Price,"You can definitely hear a difference, but for beginners like me, this guitar is good enough for a fantastic price. I would recommend restringing it once you get it, but you don't have to."
2,Damaged,"Read the reviews before ordering this for my grandson. Although there were some negatives, most were good for a first time student. It arrived yesterday and fortunately I noticed this morning that the lower body of the front of the guitar was cracked and coming apart from the side and bottom. I emailed customer service at AB right away - their return policy is that they must be notified 'within 48 hours of receipt of instrument of any damage"" in order to return for refund. Since it is Saturday don't expect to hear back until Monday. If I don't. . .! I will buy a guitar for my grandson but will make sure that I can see it before purchase."
1,You may not want this guitar if you actually play guitar,"1) The action is a little high for me. Not super high but could be lower for sure. 2) The frets stick out so bad that my hands were literally cut up from doing bar chords up and down the neck. I had to bandage my hand up for gigs. I now of calouses where the frets rub my hands but STILL. 3) The sound leaves a lot to be desired. It's super twangy and not pretty at all. 4) The sticker around the hole is comming off even though I take good care of my guitar. 4) Last but not least, I've only had it for a few months and it no longer holds a tune though a whole set."
5,A wonderful gift,"Sandra McBride's poems are so quietly beautiful that the feelings and images they evoke stay with you long after you've closed the book. I have bought a number of copies of this book as gifts for my mom and my girlfriends. It speaks to so many occasions and milestones in a person's life, and all with keen insight, understanding, humor and pure joy."
4,Scottish Soul,"Wet Wet Wet lead singer, Marti Pellow has a very special voice. Leave it to great producers like Willie Mitchell (on ""The Memphis Sessions"") and the former leader of Chic (with Bernard Edwards) the one and only Nile Rodgers, to bring out the power and delicacy of his voice. Just listen to ""Cold, Cold Heart"" to hear that man sing! I would be the first to hope that Nile Rodgers would produce an entire album with this group. On the strength of this song alone, I recommend this CD, although there is only one other song produced by Nile Rodgers. It's too bad that Wet Wet Wet never gained greater attention in the US, because they are a self-contained band, they play their own instruments(!) and are very talented."
3,Group effort,Definitely better when used in a group setting. If you get it for yourself I doubt you will be challenged enough to benefit from it.
3,A bit too outdated,"For the amount I paid for this highly touted second hand book, I was quite disappointed with the content. Much of the content is basic to more advanced decorating how to's, with much of it too outdated to ever use.Most of the content of Powells book can be found in a host of cake decorating books, especially British, at a much lesser cost."
1,Positively the worst,"Obviously I've missed the point. Yes, there are some excellent actors in this, but I had to force myself to sit through the entire film to see if something would happen to make sense out of it. Yes, it's a parody of old time melodrama -- but it's a terrible parody and much too long. What is its purpose? What was the studio thinking?I'm old enough to remember a lot of grade B movies -- our mothers gave us a quarter for the movies every Saturday, and that quarter got us not only our admission to the theatre but popcorn and candy as well. We got a movie, newsreel, cartoon and a short. Over the years I saw some pretty lame films, but nothing this bad.Keaton, Mowbray and a few others are good -- but it's sad to see them in such a loser."
3,"Juicy gossip-fest, but who is who?","I can't believe none of the other reviews mention my two major sentiments: CURIOSITY about who Tony Somertino is supposed to be, who Brik Moore is supposed to be, who Tony's group of gay celeb friends is supposed to be. It's like a whole bunch of blind items compressed into novel form, and I'd love to know who was being described.Also, sorry, but incredible disgust at the quality of writing and, more to the point, editing of this book. I found typos on almost every single page that wouldn't be permitted in a technical manual, let alone a published novel. And the writer, although funny, needed a much stronger editing hand to rein in the Harlequinesque style of describing love, lovemaking, and most of all, fashion.Very entertaining cotton candy for the brain, but with all the people working on it, the final product should have been a lot more professional."
3,Not what you might expect,"The authors are listed as Bernard Cornwell and his wife, Susannah Kells. I get the feeling that Kells had a lot more to do with the writing, although her name is listed second in much smaller print. I bought this expecting another Bernard Cornwell, and what I got is a lot closer to Barbara Cartland. It's mostly a romance - a bodice-ripper. If this is what you want, go for it."
5,MYSTERY LOVER'S MYSTERY,These Midsommer Murders were as delightful nd entertaining as all I have seen in the past. I look forward eagerly to the next set I will be able to afford. They offer hours of stimulating entertainment. We watch them over and over.
5,gold,"anything jmt puts out is going to be amazing, this album is no exception, one of the few hip hop albums put out this year i can listen to straight throughif you can, find this:DJ Kwestion - 'Servents In Heaven, Kings In Hell: The Remix Album'it puts a whole new spin on the album and its hot"
2,no good,"i got this for my niece because she loves to dance, but this video doesnt really have a lot of dancing....more floor activity then up and around dancing."
4,Excelente livro-texto para estudantes e profissionais,"Gostaria de recomendar este livro a todos que se interessem por Psicologia e Saúde. Leitura fácil e agradável, tornando-se excelente para utilizao em programas de extenso em Psicologia da Saúde."
4,Essays on the nature and implications of technology,"This book is a collection of essays from some of the foremost scientists, innovators and businessmen in technological fields. They are essentially debating technology with one side offering reasons why it can be dangerous, the other side offering sharply differing views. Later sections in the book explore more current issues such as the Internet, genetic engineering and the implications of future advances in neuroscience. I obtained considerable insights into the colorful views of technologists on the social and economic impacts of their creations. One essay was Lotus 1-2-3 founder Mitchell Kapor arguing against the control of freedom of knowledge sharing (""The Humpty Dumpty Problem"") and calling for a balance between too little IP protection and too much. Albert Teich has done a good job of selecting the essays and I hope future editions will include new insights into emerging technologies."
3,Just Didn't Work For Me....,"This isn't a Mallory Novel like we're used too. It seemed like it wasn't even written by Johanna Lindsey....we all want more Mallory novels, and this one just isn't going to cut it. It's a total let-down and not worth the excitment. She can do so much better, and there are TONS of other Mallory storylines that can be tackled. Let's hope she agrees. Because, this one just makes us want more....."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"This authors books are generally entertaining, but this one was a bit lacking. I kept reading only to find some great surprise around the corner. Generally, it was predictable, not as funny as her other works and basically a disappointment. A long awaited sequel it was, worth the wait- NOT!"
3,"Happy to know what happened, but disappointed","I want to start by saying that Lindsey is my favorite author, but I was disappointed by this book. It seemed hastily written and lacked the character depth of the previous stories. I didn't purchase the audio version of this book expecially for that reason. I have every book by Lindsay, I usually buy both hard cover and audio of her books. I too look forward to reading/ hearing Jeremy's story, but hope it is not as disappointing as this one. Johanna Linsay, in case you read this, I would rather wait for your next brainstorm than read another obviously rushed story like this."
3,"Not the best Malory book I've read, but a necessary one","I read this book in one sitting last night. It's only 192 pages and a lot of that is the ever-lengthening recaps that we Malory fans have to endure as the family gets bigger. Since the last installment (Derek and Kelsey's story), the Malorys have been procreating like mad and are meeting at Haverston for the holidays. The plot in this one revolves around the first Marquis of Haverston and his (gasp!) Gypsy wife. Of course, it's a flashback, but not a bad one, although the story is not well-developed. The story of the first Marquis has its effects on Jason and Molly the Maid, as well as James and Georgianna, who are in the midst of a totally unconvincing spat. I like the Malorys, I really do, but as the family gets bigger and bigger the repeating of the pertinent facts (presumably for those who have never picked up a Malory novel) gets more and more tedious. Read this one because you have to."
1,cute story -- poor research of time period.....yipes....,i usually love the books by ms. lindsey -- and really this was a cute story. but this time the historic facts were not well researched--- in europe as well as the states we are not celebrating christmas by putting up decorations and exchanging presents. presents are exchanged for the new year -- not christmas & especially not christmas eve. decorated christmas trees (a tradition brought to us by the germans)do not show up in homes until the mid 19th century at least. folks are not going up to thier attics to get decorations down for the chirstmas holiday. whew! any simple research -- even at a historic site -- would have given the author this information. those of us that work at historic sites use this point as discussion for christmas traditions compared with todays holidays. ms. lindsey was way off the mark here & it surprised me.
4,#6 in the Mallory Series,"All of the Mallory family has gathered together for Christmas at Halverston. Jason, the head of the family, is still in love with Molly, his housekeeper and the mother of his son. She refuses to marry him as she is a commoner and such things are not done. Meanwhile, a Present appears. A present from the Mallory's gypsy grandmother, telling the glorious tale of how she and Christopher Mallory fell in love.This book is a wonderful addition to the Mallory series, tying up loose ends and bringing the family together for a very Merry Christmas. A good book to curl up to the fire with."
3,Not the best Present,I didn't like this as much as the other Malory novels. It was pretty short and there was more family interaction than an actual romance
5,Great for anyone that loves romance novels,"The present is about the marvelous Malory family. When they gather for Christmas they find the present. I won't say anymore than that, except that the present helps people in the household see things a lot clearer."
5,wonderful Christmas treat!!,"i absolutely loved this book!i had no idea who all these people were, because i hadn't read any of the books in the series featuring these families. however, it didn't matter in the least. i enjoyed it tremendously!!!the christmas atmosphere, the fun, the jokes between relatives, the tenderness between husbands and wives.... i loved loved loved it!!as for the story told by the diary, it is one of the most charming romances ever! i find the gypsies very fascinating as a race generally, so the romance between a gypsy girl and an English gentleman has been a favourite theme of mine ever since i read this book!"
3,Okay.....,"This was an okay read, but I do have one question. The back cover states 'Christopher Malory' as Second Marquis but when reading the actual book the old gardener said he was the First Marquis?"
4,Digital Camera for the causal user,"Great little camera....compact, easy to use, auto focus and manual settings provide for great pictures in varied situations. Regular AA batteries last long and make it easy to continue when not able to recharge."
4,Good Camera,"I,ve owned this camera for over a year now and I use often. I got it to take pictures of my son on the football field. It worked real well. I guess I give it a 4 star becuase newer cameras have caught my eye with higher mp and more optical zoom. Shoot It's a good camera as a matter of fact I've taken decent pictures of people 2 blocks away."
1,Would not recommend this camera,"Fujifilm Finepix S700 7.1MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical ZoomI cannot get this camera to focus properly - it is just off. I have tried the manual focus which is lame. It does not work. I have used the auto focus, and that is worse. The pictures (indoors with photo lights) are dark, and the colors are a bit off. Outdoors the auto setting works great. This camera needs a great deal of light to get the pictures to look like what you are shooting."
5,Right features...right price!,"As a photo enthusiast, this is my third Fuji upgrade. I have studied many other cameras but always go back to the Fuji brand. I definitely would recommend this camera."
5,"Nice camera, easy to use!","This is a nice little camera, easy to use and takes good pictures. I have always liked fuji cameras, and this one has more options than my last one, but it is not to complicated for this amateur photographer."
4,Perfect for us,Before this camera we had a simple canon. We weren't looking for anything too complicated but wanted something with a lot more options. This camera is easy to use though there isn't much different between some of the settings. It is also possible to play around with the settings too much and get things completely out of whack. It is very user friendly though with some instructions right on the viewing screen. I really enjoy setting the shutter speed. I am always taking pictures of my pets and they move around a lot. This way I capture a shot that isn't blurry. We have gotten some awesome pictures from it. We get a lot of orange ones that I have to fix too. I still haven't figured out what setting causes them because it isn't usually me taking those. If you want something with a lot of easily learned options then this is your camera. I'm sure if you are very versed in settings you could get it to do a whole lot more too.
5,Fabulous Fuji!,"All I can say is, WOW! I did a lot of research before selecting this camera and it paid off. The camera is fabulous. The optical zoom takes extremely sharp closeups, the anti-shake feature means you'll never have a blurry photo, and the color scale is right on. I have several other digital cameras including an expensive Nikon and a mid-grade HP and this Fuji beats them all, even the Nikon. I bought this for a work application but am planning to buy another for personal use. Can't say enough about how pleased I am with this camera - a STEAL for the price!"
1,Hated It! ....Boring,"If you're looking for a movie that has some in your face thrills and chills you better stay away from this one. I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen and I found myself losing interest with the characters and ultimately the entire movie as well. Since this was a slow moving plot with very little fx, there at least should have been some suspense to keep me on the edge of my seat throughout, and this offered absolutely nothing. Johnny Depp's performance was o.k., but his character and the entire film was very flat and boring."
2,Doesn't load right on my player,"I don't know if this is a problem with this title only, buy I have gotten two of these DVDs and both won't load properly on my DVD player. It may be a problem with my model player, but this is the only DVD I've run into that problem with. Region number and all check out, so suggest that if you have a Philips DVD player one might watch out for this.Update: 6/3/09: 2000 version of this DVD played without a problem so it must be something this DVD has the the 2000 release didn't. I still like the movie, even with the problem with the newer DVD."
5,Amazing,"It is amazing how many viewers totally miss the point of the Polanski film. They should pay close attention to the director's commentary. For the clearest and most detailed analysis in print, look up the entry for this film in Charles Mitchell's THE DEVIL ON SCREEN, a superb film book from McFarland. Meanwhile, both this flm and DVD deserve the highest rating."
1,Horribly Disappointing!,"This is the worst kind of movie. The movie starts out with an interesting concept, then speeds up a little, then slows down, then speeds up just enough to keep you watching, then slows down, over and over again. I was quite interested in the movie (though a bit confused), until almost 2 1/2 hours into it the movie ended and NOTHING made sense! It was the worst ending I've EVER seen! I've never wasted 2 1/2 hours like I did with this movie! It was like they just got as tired of the movie as I did and just ended it with a short scene that meant absolutely NOTHING! Sorry, this is more of a rant than a review, but it's been a long time since I was this disappointed. I'm glad I only saw it on cable and didn't waste money on rental or movie ticket or I would ask for double my money back!"
4,Johnny Depp is great!,I love Johnny Depp! This is quite a thriller but Depp is believeable in any role. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
1,Do yourself a favour: Rent this movie before you buy it.,"If you're considering buying this movie because you are interested in Roman polanski, go ahead and buy it. You will get the usual slow moving (not counting CHINATOWN) story and while watching it you'll have plenty of time to find out what you'll say to your friends when you explain to them this is really ART and not just a 1 hour movie plus a lot of transport scenes.If, on the other hand, your interested in a good horror story. Rent it first ! Chances are you'll choose to buy one more copy of THE OMEN."
2,Bad ending,"While the concept of this movie started out to be an interesting one, in the end this movie fell short. I enjoy movies that deal with doomsday and devils possesing people and stuff like that but I was truly disappointed at the end of this movie. It just drops down and leaves you feeling like you missed something. Johnny Depp as always is wonderful. He seems to be making a career comeback these days, but unfortunately this movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth."
3,Nothing is what it seems!,"A deep, yet entertaining movie that will leave you baffled and bewildered at first; however, don't give up on this film. Good solid acting, incredible directing, and a story with so many questions it leaves you wondering what it is you just watched!I have always liked Polanski films, as well as Johnny Depp's acting, so this movie (for me) was a must see. I'll admit, the first time I viewed it I was left confused and I said to myself that I regretted purchasing it. Giving it another shot recently, I was able to really sit and watch the movie for what it really is, an intellectual masterpiece.It may leave you with many questions, but again I urge you not to give up on this movie. It has a message that really blurs the lines of good and evil and shows that there may be both good and evil inside us all. How it ends is really up to your interpretation."
2,the synopsis was more interesting than the movie,"Nice idea, poorly executed. I kept waiting for something more interesting to happen... instead the story continued to drift without real purpose. The characters weren't particularly believable, or likeable, and there was a strong sense that something was missing. Like a decent script.The online editorial mentions ""Polanski's languorous direction and purposefully vague story..."" - as if that's a selling point."
1,Worst ending ever,This movie is slow and boring. The ending was extremely dissapointing. If you like unfinished movies then this is the one for you.
1,Pure crap,"Move on to better stuff. If garbage were packeaged in a box with a bow, this film would be on top of the heap."
3,Another devilish movie...,Why are there so many movies about the Devil lately?Johnny Depp seems to be better known for his weird characters in movies such as ... Edward Scissorhands ... Sleepy Hollow ... The Astronaut's Wife and now The Ninth Gate.The story was a bit slow to develop with a a scene reminisent of Eyes Wide Shut. The ending was a total dissappointment! I wouldn't buy this one...if you're still curious - rent it on video.
2,The Ninth Gate - I regret watching it for $1.99 on instant video,"Something was missing from this movie. It reminded me of the old Christopher Lee movies that I watched on TV when I was 10 - 14 years old. They were supposed to be scary, but I found them stupid and ""fuddy-duddy"" boring films. I didn't care for any character so I didn't really care how this movie ended. SPOILER: I think that the main character chose to be the She Devil's patsy because he just hated himself, his life as he lived it, and people in general. I don't think I needed to spend $1.99 on this. It was well-acted but just so useless as a film for me. Maybe I'm wrong, and this is the sign of a good movie -- that you want to take a shower after you watch the worthless characters in this movie. You have my opinion -- SO BE FOREWARNED. HA HAHAHAHAHAHA (evil laughter)"
4,Interesting,"The reviews are about as interesting as the movie. Most people can find faults with the movie, yet most are intrigued by it at the same time. Some are offended due to religious sensibilities, others are offended because they read the book.I just find the movie interesting. I find Corso likeable. I like most of Depp's acting, he's usually understated and underrated. His deliveries are always more on the subtle side, a method I highly prefer. And the movie is subtle and low keyed as well. And what a lovely devil. Seems that the devil is not what it's cracked up to be. Of course, in reality, neither is the real devil--namely, there is no devil. This truth, if it were really believed, would come as a complete shock to the majority. How much they would miss him, as he's a part of all of us, just as is the god."
5,Another great Veggietales show.,"For some reason I was able to buy this at Walmart on Feb. 23, 14 days before Amazon's release. I watched it tonight and I really enjoyed it. The story of Moses is very enjoyable. Larry singing the Blues is a great silly song (even though Larry never really gets the hang of it). It's silly, but it isn't really a catchy tune that you will find yourself singing in the car. The story about Duke and Petunia is fun. The story is only loosely based on Ruth and Naomi. This is another great Veggie show to add to your collection."
2,terrible cliches make it boring and uninteresting,"The story itself, as it really happened would have been interesting, had it not been for the way Follett wrote this whole thing. I admire him otherwise and love his books, but this one wasn`t quite worth buying. Good and clever American guys defeating the stupid and uncivilized Iranians, the whole book is about praising Uncle Sam."
3,Why Ross Perot Couldn't Get Elected Dog Catcher,"This is an enjoyable book. Follett is a great writer. Read it, you'll enjoy it.What I found most interesting is that even though Perot hired Follett to write this book, it still makes Perot look like the most paranoid, wannabe, egomaniac out there.Read this book with that in mind and you'll love it."
3,A fascinating story but not particularly well told,"Follett's account of the rescue of the senior EDS personnel from Iran lacks warmth, it is rather one dimensional and uninspiring."
1,"if you want facts, avoid this book like the plague","I was hardly able to finish this book. As a space buff, I want facts and figures, not careless statements such as are found here. Read the books by Duke, Cunningham, Lovell, Borman, Cernan, Slayton, Kranz, and Collins and you will get the space info you seek. It is interesting that the UFO buffs all love this book, while the space buffs didnt like it. Draw your own conclusion."
3,"Great product, too many pills.","I am very happy with this brand of prenatal vitamins. I have not found these vitamins to nauseate or constipate me like other ones I have tried. The major drawback is that you have to take six per day. I have enough problems remembering to take ONE vitamin, not to mention, swallowing so many all the time. A bottle with 180 tablets is only going to last for a month. I am using the Rainbow Light Prenatal One now and think they are just as good and much more convenient. One drawback though...they don't have as much calcium and they have no PABA (which is very helpful if you are getting ready to try and conceive). For a complete listing of the nutrition levels, check out their website at rainbowlight dot com."
3,Textbook. Good intro to topic. Book well designed.,"I read this book as part of a correspondence course through the University of California, Berkeley in 1997.The book is 8x11, about 350 pages, color photos and diagrams. The typography and layout are very good. Text is dense. The writing style is clear.Chapter topics: Intro, Darwin, cell biology, genetics, race, human variation, primate evolution, living primates, primate behavior, hominid origins, interpreting early hominids, homo erectus, homo sapiens, lessons learned.I rate the book average because topic coverage seemed thin. Later editions of the book contain more material. The book is graphics-rich. Lots of drawings, photos etc. More so than I am used to seeing in textbooks."
4,im hooked on great white,"great white has another great release with hooked. the brash and ballsy attitude of great white shines throughout the cd with some ballads including a great one called afterglow. the only problem is sometimes the lyrics can be pretty dull, and a couple songs like cold hearted lovin and south bay cities are like country music. but all in all this is a great album well worth the price of admission."
5,I couldn't have picked a better title myself.,"""Essential"" speaks for itself---if you're a Yello fan you've gotta have it. It's a compilation of Yello's best known singles from the '80's, including three tracks from the 1991 album ""Baby"" and a number of remixes from ""1980-1985: The New Mix in One Go"", which, unless you have access to a site like this one, you won't know where to find them. Excellent!"
4,This is a great electronica album,Yello is doubtless of of the masters of the weird and unusual. Their album is moody and a masterpiece of the genre. A must for anybody willing to broaden their musical horizons.
5,Silver Marcasite and Garnet locket,I purchased this and the heart-shaped lockets to make presents for my daughters. The lockets are beautiful and have received many compliments.They arrived very quickly and the purchase went very smoothly.Thank you!
5,5 Reasons For Beginning Buddhists to Consider This Book,"1. It gives actual practice of actual Buddhism under extreme stress, showing how, why, and when to do it.2. It opens the heart to compassion by reading it. Hard would he be of heart who doesn't weep reading this.3. It opens the mind to the supernatural realm of the bodhisattvas, an arena traditionally populated for Westerners by angels, and an extraordinary experience of reality in and of itself.4. It teaches the 4 Noble Truths through example and story, showing suffering and the way free of it without needing to teach.5. It teaches chanting, which has been a tremendous support for Buddhists through the ages, and gives the simplest, easiest, most direct and practical for application translations of the Prajna Paramita and the basic Vows of Buddhism.All in all, a remarkable experience of a book. I've read it twice and each time come away transformed. I practice the chants I first learnt in this book daily. It is a fine piece of work."
4,Say'Yes' to Love: God Unveils SoulMate Love and Sacred Sexu,This book is worth the time and meditation on the principles of love and in comprehending the soulmate connection. I enjoyed reading this book.
2,Very slow,"Slow Motion RiotI started this book over a week ago and I am going to give up on page #87.This novel is very slow developing .I read 1 or 2 books per week but could not get interested in this book.I hate to give up on a book,but after nearly 100 pages you should look forward to picking the book up and continuing reading.This book does not do it for me"
4,Sexy and Effective,"I was excited to have this item arrive. I thought it was very attractive and effective. I got a 34B, but I think I will exchange it for a 32C. I found the cup size a little bit small and that the waist was not cinching as tight as I would have wanted. I plan to wear it under my strapless wedding gown."
3,Drug Abuse Prevention,"I actually haven't used this book at all for my class which stinks, but hey it came in time and I got it for a better price than the book store was offering me!"
2,Dum Dee Drum Dee Dum Dee Drum,I love funky beats and bass lines but this is too repetitive and lacking any heart. Great as background music but not good for much else!
1,Why is this titaled Bipolar and Proud?,"Is this guy actually Bipolar, or is he just an idiot making fun of the mentally ill?"
3,FOXYBROWN,"I love B2M but I could only give this CD 3 stars. Some songs cannot be improved upon, they are great just the way they are. B2M mistakenly picked some of these songs...i.e. Sara Smile, Let's stay together, and For the Love of you. These ""boys"" should go back to doing what they do best, creating their own love songs."
3,These Boyz can Sang!!,"They can Sang, however,like another writer, wrote,I would like to hear them do their own songs. Come on Boyz, you all need better management, and you need better marketing. You guys can sing, just get better, don't down play your singing abilty with someone elses songs. Sing, Sing, Sing."
3,Silly copy protection,"I rip all my CDs to put on my iPod so I was very unpleasantly surprised to find this CD had the MediaMax copy protection. Google ""MediaMax"" and you'll find instructions on how to defeat this silly copy protection (it's very simple).As for the music, the Boyz once again show off their immaculate voices and don't seem to miss the services of Mike ""Bass"" McCary. However, the musical arrangements don't quite measure up to the fine vocal performances. While their faithful interpretation of ""Close The Door"" overcomes the overuse of synthesizers, ""Let's Stay Together"" doesn't do it for me. Definitely a mixed bag."
4,Great for Older Listeners,"This is a throwback. I'm much older and I love most of the songs in this collection by the original artists. My favorite song was ""You Make Me Feel Brand New"" by the Stylistics. The cover was almost as good as the original. The cover of ""Let It Whip"" by the Dazz Band was great. My guess is teenagers would find this collection too slow and boring but us oldies but goodies would like it a lot."
4,Fun!,"From the start of the album, with the marching horns. To the last track this album is upbeat.The lyrics are artsy and angsty and The Plot can be melodic and harsh. Sometimes they can be the extreme of both in the same song.I gave it four stars because although it's a fun album and it's great to listen to.It didn't knock me out of my socks."
1,Don't pay for what you can have for free.....,"This is the biggest rip off book of all time. Basically a collection of Kraftmaid and other cabinet manufacturers brochures put together into a book. These are the materials that you can get for free at any home remodel center or from the manufacturers directly when you are planning a remodel. As most of those brochures tend to be, the book is uninspiring and completely unoriginal. All the layouts are too ""staged"" and don't look real probably because most of them are showroom designs with zero real life feel.Pompous designs without real charm ,in other words.Worse I purchased it becaused it mentioned bathrooms, my area of interst at the moment - turns out the book only has 15 out of 110 pages covering bathrooms."
1,False Advertising,"This ""solid brass electric candle"" does not really have a solid brass base - but rather a ""brass-finish"" (tinfoil). Brass-plated products don't last nearly as well as solid brass. Product description is incorrect."
5,Lively Country Christmas Music,"It is toe tappin, hand clappin fun music. I really enjoyed it. No regrets on my purchase."
1,One of the Worst Books,"I read this book for my book club and found it to be one of the worst books I've read. When the book club convened the first words out of 5 womens mouths were ""This is one of the worst books I've ever read."" There's nothing much more to say here."
5,Great!,"Plot: Someone attempts to kill Inspector Clouseau, but fails. Clouseau goes along with it and fakes his death to capture a drug ring in Hong Kong and find his would-be murderer.Review: The movie's opening credits scene is, as always, a hilariouly violent cartoon segment- Clouseau vs. the Pink Panther. Highlights include a bicycle-powered zepplin, a paint-by-numbers Pink Panther, and lots and lots of guns/explosives. The movie itself is just as funny, with goofy gags like the Inspector's car (""The Silver Hornet"") falling apart.....twice, Chief Inspector Dreyfuss constantly fainting after being shocked by Clouseau, various disguises, the climax (let's just say the 4th of July is coming early), and Clouseau's award ceremony.Closing Statement: See this movie now! It's one of the best of the series, and an entertaining way to spend an hour and a half."
4,Very enjoyable...,"I find most of the Pink Panther series enjoyable... ""Revenge"" is pretty good... The soundtrack is good considering it was originally recorded in mono... I highly recommend ""Return"" and ""Strikes Again"" from this series...I think they're the funniest. Also check out the cartoons..."
4,Good Value,This three-lens set works well. There is some minor distortion if the camera is zoomed out. Best results with a small aperture with zoom in. Also set the camera to macro. Note that you will need a step-down ring to 52mm from whatever diameter your camera lens is.
5,Works for Me!,"I just got my first ipod at age 32! Now I fit right in. :) No really, so I got an ipod and then wanted to immediately wanted to listen to it in my car, so I bought some adaptor from China, one of those big white casing ones, I had a hard time in some cars because of the lighter location and how big the adapter was, well not long, it fell apart. Then I bought a different FM adapter, which kept turning off and on and was like $75. Then I found this one, it was under $50, like $45 or $49 of something like that. It works great, I would like a AC adapter for when I use it at home and places. I put it next to my clock radio at work and in my car and at home near my alarm clock even, I take it with the boomb box to the beach, and to the inlaws with gret party mixes. :) Overall, I think it is great technology and works wonderfully. It is small so I am afraid of loosing it, but other than that, I would highly reccomend this product."
2,Can't recommend it,"Although it has a nice clean interface, and is easy to use, the audio is poor - sounds very scratchy. I would pass on this one. (Same reviews in epinion.com)."
1,Where should I start,"A co-worker gave me this book to read at work, and I think she must not like me because this book is awful. I generally don't read these types of books, but thought I would give it a try but, I cant get past the terrible typos. It reads as if it wasn't edited at all. I can't understand why anyone would spend their hard earned money on this garbage. I couldn't not even finish this book. I just don't understand what the point of this book is. If you looking for some stimulating literature this ain't it. I guess I should have know that by the title."
3,A nice one,"This book was ok,you definitely have to get the first book which is called sheisty or you will be lost. I actually took a chance when i brought the first book, it turned out to be a good book to read i could not put it down and actually finished in a day both books."
2,Needs and editor,"The story line is okay. However, it's as if no one at all proofread this book before printing it. I mean, there are so many typos. It truly does take away from the story's plot. It's an O.K. read. Not the best book I've read by a long-shot. Get an editor next time."
1,Yech.,"I remember the hype around this book when it was originally going to be released. It was hyped as going to be turned into a musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber as a sequel.Once it came out...yech. When the author trashes Gaston Leroux in the beginning of the book, I knew this was going to be a dismal read. The Phantom rapes Christine, thus producing a child, and Raoul is impotent? Gimmie a break. Totally out of character for everyone."
4,An highly enjoyable book,"I recently listened to this book on tape and enjoyed it immensely! Each section was read by a different voice, sometimes with others thrown in for the parts of the main characters. The voices are exceedingly well done, and lend a rich texture to the drama. As to the story, I found it a credible and well-done sequel to both the original book and to the opera. The fact that the story is told from all these different viewpoints, does take away a bit of the continuity found in most novels. However, overall the effect was negligible to my enjoyment of the story."
2,I don`t know what to say,"I really don't know what to say, with this is the third book of Frederick Forsyth that I don't like at all...When you read this book you will know the story of The Phantom of the Opera, but if you only read the preface the book will be perfect, the rest of the book is what happened to the phantom when he escaped from France, that includes two or three chapters that don't have to do anything in the book, take my advance, don't waste your time with this book."
2,interesting concept,"What happened to Erik at the end of The Phantom of the Opera? That's the basis behind this story. It is a quick read (which is probably a good thing) but ultimately its just bad mass produced Phan Fiction. There are many plot points that contradict the Leroux novel and some of the things characters do are so out of character you wonder how familiar Forsyth is with the primary material (his critique of Leroux in the prologue notwithstanding. wow did he not like the Persian. Heck or Raoul for that matter). Even so, if you can get past all the drawbacks the ending is very touching and that is why i gave the novel the benefit of the doubt and two stars. Would i read it again? nah. once is enough. read it just to assuage your curiosity. Borrow it from the library, though. Don't buy it."
1,"Awful, should a REAL Panthom exist, he would sue Forsyth !!","This book has nothing to do with other works from the same author. It is difficult to believe that this is the same author of bestsellers ""Odessa"", ""Jackal"", and so forth. FF even is critic against LeRoux novel, but his is worst. Rather he likes Leroux's style or not, Leroux's book is a classic, while Forsyth's book is only crap.I agree that Lloyd Weber's opera is the best expresion of art regarding the legend of the Phantom. And Leroux's novel is not a great novel, but Leroux created the Phantom, and he has the paternity over all the other books, movies, etc about the character. FF book is a waste of time and money. Don't read it."
1,Doesn't even deserve the one star!,"All my friends warned me, but I just had to see for myself. Well, I saw...and almost wish I hadn't! In the preface of the book, the author of *this* singular work discounts everything M Gaston Leroux had created when he wrote the original novel nearly a century ago. The story is told in a patchy tedious round about way. To say that the style is evocative of Susan Kay is both an insult to Ms Kay and to the story. As an idea, the story might have had merit if only handled by a more capable author, one more familiar with the story rather than someone who just walks right in and decides to change the whole thing. No respect!"
1,After all these other reviews...,Actually I didn't waste my $$ on this one but ordered Susan Kay's paperback right off the bat.
1,Uugh,"I believe that this book is an insult to the real Christine Diae, Comte Raoul de Chagney and Erik (the phantom of the opera). The reader must understand that the story Phantom of the Opera really did occur. The ending of the story was left unknown because the ending was not known. Mr. Forsyth portrays the phantom as a lust-hungry villian and totaly twists around the true facts. He makes Christine look like a wealthy snob, and Raoul a man she only married out of convenience! Sir Andrew Loydd Webber must have hated the book as vehemently as I did to decide not to write a sequal to his first musical based on it."
3,"Formally interesting, but textually lacking.","I've been a fan of the ""Phantom of the Opera"" craze for some time, and was naturally interested when I found this book, for what patron of the story hasn't imagined the lives of the characters beyond Gaston Leroux's novel. Forsyth makes an interesting guess, having Erik become a corperate (but hidden) giant in Manhattan. The form is interesting, moving back and forth between voices, but this tends to become confusing, espeically in Cholly Bloom's dialect. Some characters are more interesting and more critical to the story then others, but the all seem to be given the same stage space, and I found myself skipping pages to get to the next section. This may be a novel for the Phantom fan who has to have it all, and maybe one for those who are casually aware of it, but it is not a novel for people who treat the story intellectually and who are more concerned with keeping it true to it's form."
1,Phantom Dissappointment,I bought the book because I liked the original story and respected Frederick Forsyth. I found the book to be an almost total waste of time. It's written as thought it were a newspaper article. The characters never exhibit personality or emotion. It was extremely bland throughout and was a chore to finish. Motivation fot the actions of the son at the novel's finish were totally lacking of explanation. It was a waste of money and time to struggle through it.
3,Not as bad as you might believe...,"Many of people here are reviewing this as if this book in some way is to be compared to the musical ""The Phantom of The Opera""...Though Forsyth is a friend or at least, an acquaintance of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, this book takes the story beyond the ending of the musical. This is not Forsyth's best work, by any means, but despite some of the reviews posted here, it is not that bad, either. It is very pleasant, readable book, not literature, but exactly what Forsyth intended I believe, a light read for lazy summer days or those days when there is nothing on television you want to watch, nothing else you really want to do. It's not supposed to be a great book, but it is an enjoyable one.At least give it a chance..."
2,Read if you need to read everything phantom!,"I did not enjoy this book as much as many of the other phantom stories that I have read. I try to read anything on the phanom, but this one was hard to get emotionally involved in. It jumped around so much that you were always being jerked to the next spot before you really got involved in where you already were. Although you could follow what was going on it just did not flesh out each situation enough to really get you involved and it felt somewhat cold to me. I will keep my copy just because have have to have everything phantom!"
4,Wanting More,"This book gave great background in the beginning to how the Phantom, as we know it, began. Within the pages, you were lucky enough to get to know the characters. The book is written in diary form so I read it in one day. I was left wanting more though. We have a hint of what happened, but I feel the author left us wondering. I want to know how the relationships formed and grew for all involved. I would tell any true Phantom fan to read this book and enjoy what was given to us."
4,"No commentary, no extras!",I'm still glad to own this set but there is no commentary and no English subtitles to highlight the films. I had a previous DVD of this - must have been from another producer - and the commentary was invaluable. It's very much missed here.
4,Power of the Will + Olympia,"This two DVD set is quite good. The video quality of 'Power of The Will' is excellent. The video itself is quite spectacular showing the greatest Nazi celebrations of the time. I will never get sick of watching it.Unfortunately the video quality of ""Olympia"" is not so good, just an average copy from VHS. I actually have an off air recording of the first part which has a much higher video quality. The video is quite entertaining and offers great shots with good composition, camera work and sound.The two DVDs come in a nice tin red box with a 3D printing of the swastica.A must have excellent documentary material. All German original, without any 'talking heads' appearing."
1,Books,I ordered this book and it was used when it arrived. I thought I ordered it new and so wasn't pleased. The seller said it was used-good condition. It was fair to poor and was a discard from a library.
3,Bolle Vigilante Frames,"These are the third pair of Vigilante frames that I have owned over several years. I live in Florida so sunglasses are esential equipment for outdoor activity. I ride a bicycle 40-50 miles a week and play tennis 3-4 times a week. These frames are comfortable, stable and offer a choice of lenses for tennis, golf, or driving/riding. Vision is distortion free with adequate wrap-around and protection. My only complaint is with the durability of the temple pieces and nose clips."
5,Great for golf,I used these for golf before the weather got too cold. Great contrast and clarity. I would recommend them for all golfers.
1,Forget IT!!,Neither of my breeds will come near this stuff. Even my biggest pig gets one whiff of this stuff on his food and he won't even taste it. Must be absolutely horrible for him to turn up his nose!
5,"""ONE OF THE BEST PIONEERS IN HIP HOP""","THIS MAN IS AL OF THAT ALL HAIL REIGN THE KING!!!I LOVE THIS ALBUM IT CONTAINS SOME OF MY FAVORITES BY K.BLOW. IT DOESN'T CONTAIN ""KRUSH GROOVIN"" I LOVE THAT SONG AND HE IS FEATURED ON IT W/ THE KRUSH GROOVE ALL STARS. HE HAS DONE SO MUCH IN THE HIP HOP INDUSTRY. HE SHOULD BE INDUCTED INTO THE HIPHOP HALL OF FAME BECAUSE HE DEFINITELY DESERVES THE HONOR. HE IS INCREDIBLE AS A PRODUCER, AND AN ARTIST. THIS ALBUM CONTAINS SOME OF MY FAVORITES : THE BREAKS, PARTY TIME, AJ SCRATCH, BASKETBALL, AND MANY OTHERS THIS CD BRINGS BACK MEMORIES!!!!"
3,Just a few good songs.,"I bought the CD and only recorded the songs that I liked and remembered listening to back in the day. The others songs I never heard of, I listened to and really wasn't impressed. I can see why radio stations didn't play those songs. That isn't to say that Kurtis Blow is a bad musician. He has talent in his profession, but the CD wasn't all that it was meant to be. For only fourteen songs, I recorded about five or six. I wouldn't rate it any lower or higher than three stars."
3,So perfume....,"I was taking the road to the shyness because of my constant bad odor, but with this product, I smell a miracle REALLY! the only bad thing is that I didn't stop swelling but I dont care that much anymore 'cause I smell sooo good!!"
4,Works well...no irritation!,"I have had excessive persperation since I was a teenager. I've tried the perscription stuff, Drysol...but had horrible irritation with it and discontinued using it even though it worked. It took about three days of using the Secret Clinical Strength - Poweder Scent to really begin working. I use one click under each arm at night and one click under each arm each morning. It's kept me pretty dry...even in 80+ degree weather. I have noticed some minor persperation in the later afternoon evening, but it is very minor compared to what it used to be. I will definitely continue using this product even though it doesn't keep me 100% dry, 98% dry is better than nothing!The powder scent is great too! I think it smells more fruity/floraly than powder, but I love it!"
2,Overhyped,"I used this product exactly how the directions said, at bedtime, everyday until the container was empty. I never saw the advertised results. Perhaps because the concentration of the active ingredient is only slightly higher than in the average antiperspirant, it is only slightly more effective. For me it was not worth the extra money. It would be a good choice for a woman who may sweat a little more than average and who wants softer underarms (I know that's an great concern for all of us).If you are like me and sweat regardless of the weather and of stress, you probably have an actual sweating problem and would be better off seeing a doctor about it than buying an ineffective antiperspirant."
1,Terrible product!,"Just like any woman who has a higher than average sweating problem, I decided to try the clinical route and picked up this product.I tried it for a few weeks, ok worked well. Now it's summer and I'm sweating way more. I've found I've had to apply this product twice a day! I went through way more deodorant than I should and it was costing me a lot more money.Also, it's pretty bad when your significant other comments on how bad your armpits smell since the product doesn't work!"
1,Nothing New,"Mitchum for men Unscented has the same ingredient at the same level and is less than half the cost. It works very well. I have used it for years and I am a woman. Secret Clinical is a total rip off. You can use Mitchum and save money. But you won't smell like a flower or anything because it is unscented. Secret Invisible solid is the same ingredient at 19%, which I find works just as well and offers different scents, and it is less than 3.00 as opposed to 7.49 for the ""Clinical""! It is just another marketing tactic to make you think you're getting something that isn't already out there. Mitchum has been around for a LONG time! Don't waste your money."
3,I didn't go for this film as much,I considered going for this film because I see Don Knotts on the front of the box things he was the main and only one who was going to race and dean was going to tell him how but it turned out different
5,Interesting individual account,"This is a short, intense account of a specific period of the war. I found this to be a gripping story, and hard to put down. With the number of personal accounts appearing, I also found it interesting that it tracks and crosses with several other personal accounts currently available dealing with the battle for Berlin. The one disappointment is that the story starts in the middle, since the ending was so exciting, I would have liked to read about the beginning. Because it is the story of one person and limited to his view as a member of a mortar platoon, I would recommend reading something with a larger scope to give this book more context. None of this detracts from the book, however, I heartily recommend it."
1,A very poor book,"I do think this is a very poor book.The author's style is really poor.Secondly, he expresses his strong national socialist and racists views throughout the whole book. The scenes descriptions are therefore very annoying and the book becomes boring. Without any meaningful reflection or analyses.The only interest in this book is the opportunity to read one fanatical SS's mind and way of thinking. It really fits their reputation. Even after the war, the author still believes the waste superiority of the enemy numbers defeated Germany. How can this be?I would rather recommend readers to choose instead ""the forgotten soldier ""from Guy Sajer or ""Seven days in January"".This book is not worth buying, I'll send you mind for free if you want.Best regards."
4,A good read,A honest book about the bitter fighting on the Eastern front during the last days of the Second world war. A read which is comparable to Sven Hassel's 'Wheels of Terror'
4,SYSTEM X,Evergy track just CRANKS!!! Good stuff!...radio stations nationwide should be playin more of this kinda music - cuz it ROCKS!
1,Unconvincing!,"As Mr. Witham states in the ""Acknowledgements"", he is no expert on any of the topics, he writes about. He simply quotes ""authority"" after ""authority"",with no input of his own.I had read Richard Dawkin's book THE GOD DELUSION prior to reading this one, and I hoped for an equally convincing argument for the Design Idea. This book does not even come close to meeting my expectations. Since Mr. Witham does not seem to understand the arguments of the Pro-Design-Faction, he cannot put the quotations he constantly cites into proper perspective. He obviously believes, that Evolution is wrong and Design is right, but this book cannot convince anybody straddling on the issue.Surely, Mr. Dawkins wins this competition hands down."
4,A rare jewel,"This book is about the life and coming of age of a young wealthy English boy, who goes to school at Rugby. Throughout the novel, we are witnesses to the growing up of Tom and his friends. Tom is not a model boy, but rough, virile and self-confident, as is his friend East, a smart and audacious guy. The story is funny and entertaining, and is also illustrative about life in the English boarding schools (for affluent people) in the XIX century. It is also a bildungsroman, that is, the story of the education and maturation of a young person. Although the story contains carefully hidden, and sometimes easily identifiable, morals, it is not a long lecture. It is easy to read and understand, and I consider it highly recommendable."
1,Falsely Advertised,"Warning!! Contrary to what Amazon are advertising this book is ""Tom Brown's School Days"" ONLY and does not include ""Tom Brown at Oxford"""
1,So bad I laughed...,"I bought ""Tom Brown's Schooldays"" in supposedly ""good"" condition. Yes, it was used, but I only needed the book for a class so I didn't really care. I paid $3.99 (it was a 'penny book' but shipping cost me)and it came the following week. However, when the book arrived, I saw the condition was far from what was advertised. The pages were yellowing and within two days, and only being read twice for a total of maybe 15 minutes (it was fairly dull in my opinion), the cover fell off. Another few days and the back cover was gone as well. Then I noticed the edges of several pages were torn. I realize it was ""used"", but the seller should have at least been honest about the book's condition. The irony is, the book now looks VERY well-loved, but I didn't like it personally. Maybe the previous owner loved it, literally, to pieces."
1,You can bend this metal with your bare hands!,"Don't waste your time and money on these pans...These pans are so cheaply made that two of them got squashed during shipping. They were squashed so bad that the lids wouldn't fit them anymore. When I tried to unsquash them to make them round again I was SHOCKED how easy it was for me to bend the metal. Hey Farberware, I shouldn't be able to fold your pans in half with my bare hands. I chose Farberware because its a known brand and I thought it was a quality brand. I am so completely disappointed and shocked at the number of corners Farberware must have cut to make these that I'm never buying a Farberware product again."
2,Utensils not included,"I recieved this item but there were no utensils in the package. The pots and pans are nice enough, except that the skillets are very shallow and do not hold much. I would not buy this product again."
5,Perfect for a starter kitchen,"For a beginner cook like me, these are perfect. I bought these a year ago when I moved into my first apartment without roommates. I opted for non-stick since I still have a tendency to burn things. Unlike other reviewers, the non-stick coating has not deteriorated on my set, and only some of the paint on the bottom of the pans has chipped off (but this is the part that is directly above the stove flame, so I'm not really surprised). The lid handles are plastic, not metal, so you can pick them up without burning yourself. The dutch oven lid actually fits the smaller skillet, but none of the other lids fit the larger skillet. The additional utensils are very thin, and will probably melt if you leave them on the heat, but they are handy when needed."
5,Perfect size for travel snacks!,I love the size of these bowls! They are great to put snacks in and toss in the diaper bag. They are quality plastic and last a long time. I am buying more because over time you loose a few here and a few there. Great to have on hand if you have toddlers.
4,A lovely read,"A great pleasure for the armchair traveller and gourmet. And how nice to read about a less common part of France, the Lot, rather than the ubiquitous south of France. My only criticism is the sloppy proofreading in the hardbound first edition."
4,I Just Had to go After Reading the Book.,"I found a link to this book on the site of the B & B in Albas I was planning to visit during my trip to France last year. I bought & read the book and had to see for myself. Since my traveling companion & I were going to be in the area we e-mailed the owners of the B & B to make us a reservation.It was the most marvelous meal I've ever had. Three hours long and there was no sense of time having passed. The owners were lovely and I have never seen a cleaner kitchen ever, anywhere. My only regret is that we didn't have time to see much of the village he writes about.My dream is to go back & do it again. I'm so glad I read this book."
1,"Maybe good for industrial use, not home use",Soaks up a half cup of butter before you get started. Buy a thin paintbrush from a Home Depot....it will work better and cost less.
3,"nice brush, but loses bristles now and then","I like this brush, but it loses bristles and they get in my food if I am not careful. Washes well. I keep mine in the fridge in a cup and have no need for a spray-on oil, just grab the brush and grease the pan."
4,love,this series are interesting and informative.. great scenery stories I would definitely buy again very educational and informative love Rick
4,"Love's Theme, the Best",I used have Loves Theme on a LP and now to get it plus Barry White was a real Plus
3,Good but not great,"I was really looking for all romantic/sexy type songs. Perhaps some people younger than I would consider these romantic, but not all of them are."
5,Classic and wonderful,"Heads above any other musketeer attempt except maybe the (surprisingly good) Gene Kelly classic. Shows how today's film industry is incompetent to produce usable action/adventure pictures. Great stars and excellent writing. Today's industry is not a pimple on this films a..... and Pirates could have done with some Fraser writing to get it above the utter unimpressive dreck consistently trowelled out by the ""best"" writers of the poorly served action industry of today. Against this classic the best films of today are poorly done cartoons."
5,Wonderful!,"If you've never seen this version of the Three Musketeers and the Four Musketeers, then you're in for a treat. While it does have some very funny moments as well as some ridiculous incidents, it's much more serious than most of the Musketeers movies made both before and after this version. It brings to life the time, court and politics of the original books. This is probably the best adaptations of the Dumas novels on screen. The cast is stellar and everyone is perfect for their parts. See it and enjoy the world of Dumas through the glories of film. I can't think of many movie watching pleasures of action/adventure as well as politics as much as this set. Enjoy, everyone."
2,Enjoyable,"These two movies are a 'guilty pleasure'. There's a ton of swashbuckling and sword play mixed in with humor and satire. Racquel Welch is beautiful but has limited scenes. It's predicatable and their is a 'see-through' plot, so if you're looking for a serious, well-written show this IS NOT it. It is a 'guilty pleasure' with a few laughs."
5,Swashbuckling at its best!,"I saw these movies when I was a kid, and have continued watching them every chance I got. When I saw that they existed on DVD, I had to buy them.These are the very best of swashbuckling movies, with great actors and a fantastic scenery. Christopher Lee is fantastic as Rochefort and Michael York is a great D'Artagnan. Actually it is hard not to fill this review with praise for all the actors, because this is one of the rare movies where no actor was miscast!The best part is that all the characters seems real, not the ordinary action heroes, they fumble, they drop their weapons, everything done with good humour. This is two good movies that everyone should see, movies that gets better every year and tells present hollywood how good movies should be made."
5,"shop sales, people","This is a great little computer, and I didn't think it appropriate that it was getting mediocre reviews just because people paid too much for it. Shop sales. :)This has been an awesome little machine for years, that even now, Oct 2007, is still better than many of the new entry-level computers out there."
3,RAM Issues,"Not so great on the RAM...Paid over $1000.00 from a rent-to-own and must say didn't get my money's worth...If you consider yourself a gamer, then look elsewhere...only 256 RAM..you'll need a lot of upgrading..Video card isn't much either..Otherwise..great for you casual web surfers and music burners...the basic stuff..Basically, I got a chip on my shoulder because of the outrageous price...and that was just for the CPU!.."
2,I opted for the Sunnheiser Freeport,"I could not get this unit to not feedback though the sound system in some cases. I could never get my voice to sound natural. But for the price, it was okay. In and of itself, I would have probably given it 4 stars, but then I got the Sunheiser freePort, at a fraction of the cost, and this rating went down to 2 stars, just because of the comparison."
5,Excellent,"I try to be as sparing as possible when giving out five stars, I mean let's face it, these pages are full of five star CDs that just aren't worth your time. This CD, however, is well worth it.There's a space in this music that's the object of any ambient liseners avid search through music. Maybe this is House, but the spirit is of the ilk of Biosphere and Boards of Canada. That rare quality of musical space so obvious, and so lacking in most music, is evident here.Maybe it's not the end of any roads, but Metamatics is a welcome resting point for those sick of the big-downbeat that forever does the rounds under the guise of chill-out music.Slip this disc in yer CD player, sit back on the sofa, stare into space and ponder the meaning of Metamatics."
5,Q:What is the chief way to understand the Larger Catechism?,"Answer: To read J. G. Vos's extremely clear commentary on the (overlooked and underread) Westminster Larger Catechism. For those who would like a one-volume, handy, theological volume to study, this would be a good one (another good one is A. A. Hodge's Commentary on the Confession). If you are someone studying for licensure or ordinations exam, or someone trying to better understand the overview of the Bible (also read his father's 'Biblical Theology for an overview), or studying for Sunday school class, or someone studying for devotion, this book is for you! It is quite indispensable as a commentary on the catechism and now after years of being out of print, P&R has seen fit to bless us! I hope that this volume will help us to return to our confessional roots as a people of God who are part of a great and long heritage of saints! 'Take up and read!'"
4,Douglas Mallach Recommended,"Douglas Mallach a hardcore and ska musician out of Houston told me to catch this movie. He is a great musician, and I thought if Douglas Mallach thinks highly of it, it's worth trying out. He was right. It's a great movie. If your a musician or just an avid enthusiast, it's worth seeing."
1,Not representative of true NYHC,"Lame bands like the ones featured on this DVD are responsible for the death of the true NYHC scene. These bands (VOD being the exception)are glorified metal bands. 25 ta life? please....horrible singer, terrible lyrics, awful musicianship. District 9? Who has even heard of these clowns? What a bunch of morons. Real NYHC = Gorilla Biscuits, Agnostic Front, Murphy's Law, Cro-Mags, Warzone, Youth of Today, Token Entry, Sick of It All."
3,Breed Heat -,Friends suggested this item. We both tried this item. Her German Shepherd and us with our Shelties - I would like to thinkit would worked!!!
3,Didn't quite get it.,"""Admissions"" was a bit of a stretch. Although the performances were top notch the basic credibility was difficult to believe. The would-be boyfriend instantly saw through the main ruse, why wouldn't everyone else? But then he was the one chasing after her when ""damaged goods"" to describe her would be too generous. Why in the world would he want to subject himself to a person as obviously unbalanced as she was? There were too many things like those in logic, and in characters for me - I don't want to have to keep giving the benefit of the doubt to a movie. Move me. Take me on a journey. Admissions didn't do that."
2,Disappointing,"I took every practice test in this book twice. When I took the real test a couple weeks ago, I was disappointed that not even ONE question was the same as the practice questions. The only thing that the book was helpful for was showing me the KINDS of questions that would be on the real test."
3,Great sound quality; hurts to wear them!,"I use these for Skype teleconferences and World of Warcraft. While the audio quality of the mic is great and the headphones is quite good, the pressure on my ears makes them unbearable to wear after an hour. I'm tempted to just wear them around my neck to use the mic and plug in $10 earphones for my longer meetings."
1,A disappointing follow-up,"Unlike the first book (which was supposed to be inspired by true events), this book is a complete work of fiction. Inexplicably, the names of the Lutz family children are changed to the names used in the film, as the Long Island Evil follows them to California. Completely ludicrous, and poorly written, this book is a waste of money! Avoid at all costs."
3,"Comfortable, but not durable.","After these shoes get broken in they're extremely comfortable. However, after about 3 months of owning these shoes, after working 6 days a week on a ferry, a few days of heavy rain, the insoles became ripped from the shoes, so I had to get new ones. Also the sole itself is coming unlaced from one of the shoes. Also, it didnt take much for one of the raw hide laces to break Very comfortable, but not very durable."
4,Classic,I first had a sebago dockside 24 years ago just bought a new one after all this years looks exactly the same feels the same ...great shoe could use a little more comfort hence the 4 star.
4,Pearl drop ear rings,The ear rings were exactly what I was looking for in a gift for my wife and the picture on Amazon was excellent.
5,Absoluely Postively the Best!,"This cologne is fantastic! I've given it to my spouse, son and friends, and EVERYONE loves it! Such a delight to find a product, at a terrific price, and receive great service! Thanks Amazon!"
5,mmmmm smells good,My husband loves this cologne and i love the way it smells on him. he ran out some time ago and we couldn't find it anywhere. as usual if i look it up on amazon 9 times out of 10 i will find it and at a really good price.
5,Gatorade at bulk price! =),"As a distance runner finishing college, Gatorade can really hit the wallet hard. Luckily, I found NRC Sports on Amazon.com. It may seem like a lot to shell out for Gatorade at first, but when you realize you're getting Gatorade at $2.15 a gallon with shipping costs included, a smile begins to show."
3,Decent vibrator,"This is a decent vibrator, though keep in mind it is a micro vibrator - not one of the big ones. Also, this has buttons and not the wheel on switch. This can be a good thing, because you are sure that the vibrator is off. However, the bad thing about it is that you can't adjust it much. You can only change it from one setting to another, which could be frusterating if you are trying to make it go just a little bit faster and click the button by mistake."
3,Device works great - batteries are not THE best,"The device itself works just like it should. The batteries work as well, but are not as great as I was hoping. I am using them for a digital camera and they get empty rather fast."
4,Pdox programming,"this is a great book if you are trying to program with paradox. If you are new to paradox this book will not teach you the basics. This is for middle to advnace users.So if you are going to try to use opal, you will need this book.the only negative, I wish the book had a better index. i.e if i am looking up a command (i.e tc.lock) it would be next to have a page listing where this command was noted in the book."
3,Obscure Database System,"The book covers the capabilities and functionality of Paradox, an unsupported database system originally created by Borland. Paradox is now owned by Corel but the company has done nothing to enhance it. Paradox 12 is the latest version.This official guide was written for version 9 and therefore is behind the times. However it is the latest decent documentation for this outdated database system. Unfortunately, very little is included to guide you throught idiosyncrasies of ObjectPAL, Paradox's scripting language. The line of thought seems to be that you probably won't need it. Probably not -- but when you have a job that uses it, it would have been nice to find some information about it.The book itself is well written and includes simple examples. It is the best book on the subject that is available."
3,Addtional Reading to Help Understand Marketing to Kids,Here are some additional resources for those of us who are trying to protectour children:The Disappearance of Childhood by Neil PostmanTo see how corporations have no ethics in their marketing to children watch:The Corporation a DVD movie
1,Where has Hagelin been?,"This sounds like a book from the 1950s when consumer advocates were telling us about dangerous products. Is there anyone around who is that naive about ""dangers that lurk everywhere""? Maybe there is. I think the reason she wrote the book is because all the information is so readily available. After reading Rebecca Hagelin's articles on other websites I realized that it is she who is just now learning that the world is dangerous."
1,Are you kidding me?,"Protect your ears! Fear change! Evil is out there! God I feel so bad for Ms. Hagelin's kids. Oh how they have no idea what awaits them in the modern world that their mother is so effectively making sure they have no knowledge or preparation for. Stick your head in the sand and pretend it all just goes away.So sad...Good luck Hagelin kids, you're really gonna need it.(Oh the fifties, where art thou?)"
5,"Inspirational, Informative, and an enjoyable read.","Now that I'm a parent with zero time, I read books to be informed AND to be entertained. If it's not too much to ask, I also want a little inspiration. In this book, Ericka Lutz provides all three. Face it, going anywhere with a kid, especially a little one, is totally scary until you get the hang of it. No, you may never take your babies around the world or even the block the way the author encourages you to... but, guarenteed, you'll get a strong sense of how to. Better yet, you'll want to. Best yet, you'll believe you can. For anybody tired of the same old magazine articles and non-fiction books with their dry old advice, I heartily suggest ""Baby Maneuvers."" I've given copies to at least three of my pregnant friends. Oh yeah... those with no sense of humor should probably avoid this one."
3,Excellent CD,Quelle voix Québécoise !Ce CD a de la 'groove' et du feeling. Très bon à écouter. Aucune petite chanson d'amour radiophonique.Les moments forts:Une femme avec toiFunkystationAimer d'Amour (Excellente reprise de Boule Noir).
1,SOS Is Great but this album is terrible,"I figured people only review albums they like, so i decided to review one I don't. Swing Out Sister is totaly amazing and Kaelidescope World is my 2nd favorite album ever. But this is a total waste. Noting to listen to here. if you have bought the album though, try it in the dark witha lava light on, then it almost has some redeeming qualites but not much. also, try ""better to Travel' Another masterpiece, this is just trash."
4,great read,"I found this short story collection by Lisa Moore to be very Comfortable. I love her writing style; short sentences, vivid imagery. Her words leave me with feelings, I never knew I could have. I loved this book. It always left me with something to think about. Great read."
1,This in NOT original Giovanni music,"This in NOT a Giovanni recording! It is a re-mixed version of an old cd done without authorization. If the cd does not have ""NewCastle Records"" on the back, it is not an official Giovanni recording. All of his music is available at his official website: www dot giovanni dot com"
5,Great book for today -- great for ADULTS!,"When we are about to spend a trillion dollars on stimulating our economy, it is a good idea to conceptualize how much money this actually is. All voting adults today should read this book now.A billion is 1000 million. A trillion is 1000 billion.I am buying another stash today and giving them to my adult friends and clients."
5,helps kids visualize,"I am a new teacher and am building my classroom library; in my opinion, it is important to include books with a math theme so that I can conduct interesting mini-lessons. Having this book helps round out the library. I think the students will enjoy it."
5,Great for teaching mathematics,This book is brilliant! For teaching about very large numbers (billions and trillions as well as millions) it is fantastic. Children (and adults) have difficulty imagining just how big these huge numbers are; this book will help thinkers of all ages. I highly recommend it for teachers of children or adults of all ages - I plan to use it with my trainee teachers.
5,Borg - maybe at his best.,"This is a wonderful, thoughtful and engaging offering from one of my all-time favorite authors. I highly recommend Borg to anyone interested in this category."
1,Overrated at one star,Amazing that one can write this revisionist nonsense and get an audience. It shows how far the Christian Church has fallen in its educational and apologetic duties. How can our community be so ignorant as to fall for this PRSH (look the Hebrew up)?
2,Broke it,"Nice leather, quality case, but the belt clip let it down. it broke the first time I caught it on my seatbelt. i sent an email to the helpdesk but never heard back. the leather is very stiff too - I find it a bit tricky getting the phone out in a hurry to answer it. i use it occasionally when i want a ""dress"" case because it does look classy and I don't mind so much that I have to keep it threaded on my belt."
4,Great for beginners!,"I'm no newbie when it comes to yoga, but when I saw that Leslie Sansone had done a yoga DVD, I had to try it. This is great for beginners because she thoroughly explains each pose and the proper form. The routine itself is slow and relaxing in pace, so that you can feel all of the benefits of each pose, and a wide variety of poses are explored. The transition into and out of each pose doesn't really flow and it's awkward at times. The background music isn't great but it could be worse. There are NO other exercisers in the background, which I loved, because I could really focus. This is a great, thorough introduction to yoga. Also check out Karen Voight's Yoga Sculpt."
3,Okay yoga DVD from a great teacher,"I am a big Leslie fan and feel that she can always make the exercises simple enough for everyone to participate. The DVD is divided into an introduction, showing the poses, some of them for an advanced beginner. There is no explanation of props as aids until later, introduced in the second half, true work out. The first half could have been left out for me. The second half is the actual session. Again, Leslie encourages work at your pace etc, but talks so much she does not cue you when to stop the pose, especially if you are twisted around and can't see the screen. The variety of poses are good though and I would do the second half to augment my own practice. Overall, a B- experience."
4,Loved it,"I am not an avid romance novel reader, but I really enjoyed this book. I love the Scottish culture and the time period she chose to write in and I loved the characters and story line. Very good book."
5,Wonderful!!!,This is my second favorite - Julie Garwood is wonderful! I finally had to go out and buy all her books. I just wish I could afford the hardcover. :)
5,One of the best!,"I really loved this book! Jamie was feisty and a great heroine, and I loved how Alec mellowed toward her and fell in love! For people who loved this book, read the Wedding, Jamie and Alec are in that one too, and they have four children. I also loved how Jamie won the loyalty of the soldiers by healing the soldier. Also, when Alec found out that she spoke Gaelic was hilarious! This book is perfect for a rainy day!"
5,Magnificant!,"This book is absolutely wonderful! This was my first Garwood book and before I even finished it, I ran out and bought several other titles by Garwood. It is hard to put this book down because Garwood keeps you on the edge of your seat. Each chapter leaves you with that ""I need to know what happenes next"" feeling. The Bride is one of the best books I have ever read. Great dialogue and lots of conflict. Alec and Jamie's story is a treat from the first page to the last."
3,The Bride,"OK this was a little racey for my mother-in-law. She is an avid Barbara Cartland fan which is how the book was sent to me. She said the book was good and she enjoyed it. However, she complained about all the 4 letter words. Just wanted to share this incase you are considering it as a gift without reading it first."
4,Jmorris,"Absolutely, this is my favorite of all Julie Garwood's books. Great characters and story, But be warned, this is at least RERELEASE number 2! That's the only reason I didn't give it a 5-star rating. Paperback versions at a fraction of the cost are available in most used bookstores."
5,Get ready for a magical time in the Scottish Highlands!,"""The Bride"" is the first novel I have read by Julie Garwood. It is a wonderful, romantic adventure story featuring a strong, courageous heroine by the name of Jamie. Jamie is a delight from the beginning. Her love, Alec, is strong, fearless and an absolute sweetheart. I fell in love with Ms. Garwood's description of the Scottish Highlands. I also enjoyed the author's wonderful sense of humour which is evident in the dialog between her very colorful characters. This is a must read for those who like adventure, romance and strong female heroines!"
2,There are much better ones out there...,"I've read a lot of books in this genre and I have to say that the dialogue in this book is immature and the storyline is simple to the point of being dull. I was hoping that it would improve as I made my way through the book but the opposite was true. I'm surprised that this book has achieved the high rating that it has. I certainly didn't like it. Take my advice - read ""Outlander"" by Diana Gabaldon. Far superior writing and story with a similar theme."
1,Are you kidding?,Stunningly awful. I kept expecting the hero and heroine to learn to speak something other than caveman. Their conversations were the most stilted agonizing irritating dialogue I have ever read. I suppose she was going for a silent dark machismo with Kincaid but Jamie couldn't articulate a sentence or a thought. Even when his personality changed dramatically for no real reason he still was stiff and unsympathetic although no longer dark and brooding. I was shocked to find this on people's romance list. The characters were shallow and the story predictable. The sex scenes needed work as well. Ugh.
3,I liked this book in spite of itself.,"I was annoyed by the pace of the relationship and the fact that both the hero and heroine were depicted as being paragons of all that is manly/womanly.Despite it all, I could not help liking this book. Both Alecc and Jamie were decent and interesting and the kind of people you would like to know.The book did suffer from a lack of character development. Did Alec have any family? Siblings? Cousins? Anything? What was he like as a child? What of Jaime's people? We know her mother married the stepfather before Jamie was born, but what of her mother's people? Did she not have grandparents, cousins, etc? Despite the fact that her father died before she was born, I would have thought that her family would have kept up with her. The time spent explaining, ad nauseum, the heorine's poor sense of direction could have been better used telling us who these people are."
4,ENTERTAINING,"I HAVE READ MANY ROMANCES BOOKS, AND THE BRIDE IS ONE OF THE BEST IN WHAT CONCERNS TO THE STORY'S PLOT. THOUGH IT IS NOT VERY ORIGINAL BECAUSE YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW THE STORY IS GOING TO DEVELOPE AND THE CHARACTERS ARE A NOT DRAWN THAT GOOD. JAMIE IS KIND OF MEDIEVAL ELISABETH TAYLOR, AND HE IS THIS BIG AND HANDSOME MAN THAT (I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THEY EAT IN MEDIEVAL SCOTLAND TO GET THAT TALL MEN), ANYWAYS, IT FULLFILLS OF THE TOPICS OF CLASSICAL ROMANCE, HANDSOME, TALL SCOTISH LAIRD VERSUS PETITE, EXOTIC ( WITH VIOLET EYES) ENGLISH TEENAGER, EHEM FOR A RAINY DAY IS PERFECT"
5,One of my Favs Finally on DVD,"I remember seeing the preview for this back in 84 when it was theatrically released but didnt get to see it until it came out on video, and i was instantly hooked. I have watched this movie hundreds of times easy. Such a great kid's movie and eventhough I am in my 30's, I still love it as much as i did when i was 12. This movie inspired me to track down and purchase an actual Cloak & Dagger stand-up arcade game..i even had the opportunity to visit Atari in CA and see one of the very few original standups that was called Agent X before Atari renamed the game to Cloak & Dagger..well, I am totally rambling now. I dont know how much i would enjoy this movie as an adult had i not seen it a million times as a kid, but this movie is GREAT for kids and kids at heart. ( I hope the DVD atleast has the original movie trailer on it)."
3,Good for kids,I really enjoyed it when it came out originally and thought I would watch it again. As an adult it was a little young but would recommend for those with kids.
4,Two kids suddenly thrown into a goosebump-raising thriller!,"I saw this film with my buddies at a junior high school and though we all had a very good time, I still looked a little fearfully around to see if there are bad guys lurking nearby in broad daylight, waiting to leap right out and grab me. I mean, there's real adult-style violence and real KILLING even though a couple of young kids appeared in this film. Gad, this poor boy had to use his very own wits to keep himself from being grabbed and shot by REAL thugs AND this meant he used a real gun and took a car for a joyride drive! Mark my words, your knuckles will remain white-knuckled all the way to the very end - where the kid will STILL be in deadly peril! And you'll never see sweet-looking old grandparents the same way ever again!"
3,Not his best but OK,All I have to say is...the book kinda drags but since I am a big Tom Clancy fan I am honored to have it as part of my collection. Get this book if you are a die hard Clancy fan. You will probably enjoy it.
2,"Tom... focus buddy, focus !","I've been a huge fan since that great start with Hunt for the Red October, what a book ! Read them all. As soon as they hit the stores (or Amazon[.com]) I buy 'em and read 'em in about 5 days, sometimes in the same day. I have over looked some flaws (wordy, wordy, wordy) in the series because of the multiple underlying stories, fascinating technical details vand abrupt plot turns. However, in Red Rabbitt, there was no there there. Just the endless set ups and meaningless dialogue.Don't worry though Tom, I will not give up after just one mistake. But please hurry, I need my fix !"
1,Dead Habbit - reading Clancy's books that is.....,I used to love reading Clancy books every other August when they came out. I literally have planned camping trips around the release day so I could relax in Yosemite and read the newest thriller in the Jack Ryan series.Never again. This book was never finished by Clancy who evidently finally realized that he could write a blank book with his name on it and it would be a best-seller. After reading red rabbit I wish he would have.The same conversations repeated by the same characters over and over again.Anachronisms that were never edited out.Scenes set up for something exciting to happen but the action was never inserted.Adds absolutly nothing to what we know about Jack Ryan.Adds absolutly nothing about what we know of the attempted assissination of the Pope.Adds absolutly nothing but frustration to the lives of those who struggle through this book.
2,An unfortunate failure.,"This book could have been great: a young Jack Ryan, a historical basis, and a previously strong cast of characters. Alas, this book falls flat.Clancy repeats himself over and over, ad nauseum: Russians like children, but don't smile; Brits and Americans have honor, the Russians have stupid patriotism; Little girls give the best hugs; Russians like children, but don't smile. Blah, blah, blah.For a former Marine, Jack Ryan is shown to be a surprising wimp, completely out of the character we've seen elsewhere.The book is completely lacking in suspense and shouldn't be classified as a thriller.Copyediting is decent, with only a dozen typos and a handful of incomprehensible sentences.My recommendation: Buy and re-read another of the Ryan stories instead. This one only rehashes the existing characters and adds nothing but an embarrasing misstep for Clancy.After Shadow Warriors, this book is Clancy's worst book to date. Let's hope it doesn't portend his future efforts."
3,"Good start, slow finish","One of Tom Clancy's better recent efforts, particularly the first half or so where he puts together the story. A major improvement over Rainbow Six and The Dragon and the Bear.It is interesting to see the young, pre-president Jack Ryan starting out as a lower-level CIA analyst,and early investory in Starbucks, and follow the Foley husband and wife spy team set up their Moscow operation that will come to fruition in Cardinal In The Kremlin.The story begins to lag heading into the second half as the author tries, it appears, to stretch the story out so the book reaches a Clancy-size 600 plus pages.Clancy recent pentient for using mouthfulls of foul language at innopportune times truly drags the book down even while his command of detail for every situation remains intact.I do recommend the book for avid Clancy fans, but don't expect a it to rival Patriot Games, Cardinal In The Kremlin or Sum Of All Fears."
1,Disappointed,"I've read all of Clancys books except the co-authoured ones (ops centre)Up to now i've automatically bought them in hard back when they came out. I'm not sure, could this book have been written before the rest & only published now ?I have found it to be very poor, in fact i don't know why i bothered to finish it.I found it wooden & lifeless. Clancy should stick to what he invented ""the techno thriller""His attempt at the spy/suspense genre is nowhere near the calibre of Ludlum or Forsyth.I hope he can return to form in the future & is not just relying on his success to date."
2,Disappointed,"As an avid Tom Clancy fan I found Red Rabbit quite boring. If you're aware of, or know all the characters in the Jack Ryan series, you will enjoy some of the new information about the Foley's, Greer, Ritter, Judge Moore, Jack and Cathy Ryan and even Yuri Andropov.Besides these new insights I found the book plodding. If you enjoy the action of Clancy's books you'll be let down with Red Rabbit. Conversation after conversation that might cause your eyes to glaze over a bit.Clancy is the master of the political/spy/action genre. I will continue to be a fan of his writing, however I am glad that I never forked out the money for a hardcover edtion of this novel.Pretty hard to recommend this book over his earlier works.Cheers!"
1,Pitiful,"I was extrenely disappointed with this book. Nothing actually happens! There isn't a tense moment in the whole book. My weekly trip to the grocery store holds more drama. Its all talk, talk, talk, think, think, think, feelings, feelings, feelings. I think Clancy was going for emotional drama, but its hollow and unconvincing."
1,Former Clancy addict.,Terrible!! Clancy sold out? It seemed as if he had a minimum page count he was trying to meet and saved the story for the last few chapters.I don't expect action on every page but at least something besides a history lesson in the 1st 600 hundred pages would have been nice.
2,Waste of Time,"Generally speaking I am a Clancy fan, but Red Rabbit has me wondering if Clancy has ran out of ideas. This book has been the hardest book for me to finish. If it was not for the fact that it was a Clancy book, I would have stopped reading it before the halfway point of the book. I kept waiting for the story to kick in to full gear, but it never did. This book, by no means is a thriller; it is more like an epic tribute to angst. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it did save me money on sleeping pills."
1,A 200 page novel jam-packed into 618 pages!,"The old windbag does it again! He repeats the same stuff over and over again in the book and paraphrases from past novels. For example, practically every major character in the book repeats a variation of Stalin's famous question, ""How many divisions does the Pope have?""This guy clearly has too many people telling him exactly what he wants to hear and he's let it go to his head. His writing style is morphing into the kind of Ann Coulter-ish ranting that extreme conservatives seem to crave.You couldn't give me this book. I borrowed one from my local library. I suggest you do the same."
3,Not Clancy's finest hour.,"I have to admit, I wasn't looking foreward to reading the novel after all of the negative reviews on amazon.com, but it wasn't that bad. It's probably the worst book in the series, it moves rather slowly, and it wasn't really neccisary in the Jack Ryan timeline, but it was kind of interesting. If your bored or you have nothing to do, read the book. I won't read it again, this would probably the last book in the series that I would read twice (followed closely by THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON)."
1,The book that never stops,"Tom, what were you thinking?! Apparently, endless prattle and relentless character self-examination has replaced the research and plot development Clancy is (was?) noted for. Repetative, boring, and far too long. This 600+ page tome could easily be condensed into a 200 page afternoon read. Perhaps the Reader's Digest version will be palatable.If you like LeCarre, you will notice some similarities; right down to some historical references oft used in many of his works. Unfortunately, Clancy seems to have lost the gift for making his characters likable and interesting. Did I mention that Red Rabbit is repetative?"
1,Bad,"Tom Clancy is good at two things-- action, and the description of military equipment. He has always been terrible at everything else.This book is everything else--an utterly tedious work where the reader is forced to wade through some 600 odd-pages of Mr. Clancy's vulgarity and mindless conservatism without any action or the description of any military equipment at all.Clancy has apparently forgotten why people buy his books."
