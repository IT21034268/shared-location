2,Monkey on tha D$ck,"This must be the stupidest album I've ever heard! I'm not saying the worst album, it wasn't that bad.. It wasn't good though. Some good tracks like the title track Monkey on The D$ck so that makes already 33% of the album good if u count the radio edit of this same track. Charlie Whop!! and Soldier Chant are worse than you could ever imagine. The fifth track aint that bad neihter, there's Juvenile and BG who save the track. This whining girl definitely doesnt need a bigger album (this one being only 21 minutes).. I'd suggest y'all would buy some newer Cash Money albums if you ain't got them all, 'cause this isn't worth buying unless you're really into Cash Money and their older albums."
4,Excellent workout DVD,"Icon Men's Greg Plitt workout DVD is an excellent production and very much worth purchasing. Greg demonstrates a wide range of bicep, tricep, and ab exercises. His description and performance of each exercise gives the viewer a good understanding of why and how to perform the movement.The introduction section of the DVD fills the viewer in about Greg's background and how became a top fitness model. Most of the DVD, however, is devoted to demonstrations of the specific exercises he recommends, and there are a lot of them. Greg has an amazing physique, with especially impressive biceps and abs.Production values are high, with good sound and picture quality throughout.Highly recommended for those looking for workout inspiration and information."
2,Not useful,Greg shows you some tips to use the exercise machines. A TV advertisement guy would do a better job than him.
4,A Horrifying Case of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy,"Presently, Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy is rare ""disorder"" that few people are aware of; but that isn't the case after reading Cruel Deception by Gregg Olson.MSBP, even today, is difficult to prosecute for lack of evidence. In Cruel Deception, Olson relays the tale of Iowa prosecutors who worked diligently to convict Tanya Reid for MSBP....in the mid-80s!! Their efforts, as detailed in this book, were impressive; especially consider this a pre-internet era!Cruel Deception is riveting from beginning to end. I especially enjoyed the manner in which Olson tells us of a ""devestating secret"" that will be revealed at trial ONLY if Tanya Reid testifies. And that secret is well worth waiting for!Once again Gregg Olson has produced a piece of written work that keeps him on my top ten list of favorite true crime writers!"
2,Mockingbird,"Mockingbird is a long book. It is about this nurse who makes her children stop breathing, and then she makes them breath again by giving them CPR. Then one of her children die, and she is taken to court for child abuse. You should read this book if you like stuff like this. Personaly I don't really like it because it has too many big medical words. It was too complicated to me."
1,Slippers,I have had these a very short period of time and only used them in the house and they are cracking and generally falling apart. Do not recommend them at any price.
2,not comfortable,"Did not fit. They slipped up and down in the heal and no arch so not comfortable, Ended up returning them."
4,Powerful !,"""Such a sad but vital story about a very real problem in our society whether it is in the US or Canada or anywhere else in this world. When I am moved to tears, as I was in chapter 16 , I REALLY FELT THAT THIS BOOK IS INDEED POWERFUL, Thanks, Sig.""INGRID N. STRUTHERS"
2,Predictible,"I bought this book after reading and enjoying ""The Fairy Tale Bride"", which is the first in the series.Although romance books tend to be somewhat predictable (all with their villain), this was beyond boring. I ended up skipping about 50 pages just to get through it.The Plot:Mean, bad guy convinces young beautiful girl to marry because evil mother told her that her true love had already married. True love finds out he is a murderer and comes to her rescue. To foil plans for the wedding true love and damsel marry, but true love won't consummate because he wants to save her honor.Bring in the personal maid, whose sister was murdered by the villain, lots of cat and mouse chase scenes, etc...Bottom line: there are much better romance books to choose from!"
5,Better than metal,"I baked two loaves of pumpkin bread, one in my new silicone loaf pan, the other in a metal loaf pan. The silicone one came out so much better, and was so much easier to remove. A little cooking spray before adding the batter and it slipped right out! I will definitely add more silicone to my baking collection."
2,soon wears thin,"sounds very promising on the first few listens, but then the bare, hollow bones show through, so to speak."
4,Stories for the Third Ear,This is a lovely book. The stories are delightful and geared to specific psychological problems. This makes the stories particularly useful when incorporated into hypnotic work.
1,LET SLEEPING MONSTERS LIE,"Charles Band, Full Moon Pictures head honcho, gives an introduction to what he calls ""Filmonsters"", which is nothing more than hour long adaptations of classic horror films. His attempts to elevate these remakes to art forms for today's young audiences merely covers up the fact that these remakes should never have been made, and if the teens want to ""identify"", Band doesn't know teens too well. Even teens can see through this shlock attempt.The young cast is pretty inept and the effects/makeup ludicrously cheesy. Band really should slow down a little and stop making so many movies; quantity is not always quality, and it shows in this one!"
1,Questionable Authenticity?,"This book does a poor job of describing the history. Throughout the book Robert payne's approach is evidently not neutral. As a result, there are a lot of hidden sentiments that are negetive. The book was written in a time when discrimination, predice and favoritism were common features of the society (1959). These feelings are apparent at various intervals throughout the text and hence do not do justice in portraying the true history of Islam."
2,Every can dented!,I didn't think it was possible to dent every can in a box. How do the ones in the middle get dented? Amazon really is innovative.
5,Great product!,"Great Product, offers needed back support, & pillow is firm so baby does not sink in, & you don't have to slouch."
2,try before you buy,I was not impressed with this pillow...I started using it right away in the hospital and at home. It was not comfortable for me and my babe didnt seem to like it either. This pillow is very rigid and is now put in storage. I really feel I wasted my money. I ended up using the Boppy and was much happier with that.
4,"Wonderful, thought-provoking readings","Spurgeon is the best! I never fail to find something to stir my heart in this book. I can't count the number of times the morning's entry has been just exactly what I needed to hear on that particular day. The readings are short, only about one page each, but rich and full of depth, providing insights that keep me thinking about my Lord and Savior throughout the day."
5,What a giggle!,"Being a fan of ""Sheep In A Jeep"" and all its sequels, I waited impatiently for ""Raccoon Tune"". It was well worth the wait! I read this one often as a bedtime story and my children (aged 10 and 6) are giggling every time. Of course Mom is right there in the thick of it too! The illustrations really make this book! I'll use this one at the Nature Center where I work with my Preschool Storytime crowd - they'll love it!"
3,Ok book,"The illustrations in the book are cute, but the story line was merely ok. This wasn't a favorite for us..."
2,Not a Swingin' Summit Meeting,"Yes it's hard to believe that the swinging Ellington Band and the best vocalist around can't connect and make sparks happen in the studio. The great Billy May wrote Ellington-like arrangments to really mediocre songs of the day. Not only were the songs mediocre the Ellington band didn't take the time to learn the arrangments and play them ala Ellington. The bands soloists are outstanding as usual; listen to Hodges on ""Indian Summer"", but the band just isn't ""in the groove"" to make the singer a swinger. Sinatra recorded with the band in the studio in real time and the great indifference to the arrangemets and the recording effect him in a personal way. His pitch is off as well as his great phrasing-listen to ""Come Back to Me"". Maybe the Chairman and the Duke should have done an Ellington Songbook album with Duke writing the arrangements. Maybe then the musical Summit Meeting would have been a truly swingin' event."
1,Disappointing,"How can one of the greatest musicians in jazz and one of the best vocalists in history ever create a really boring record is something one cannot figure out, but there you got the it. Sinatra seems to be out of every song, even in the swinging ""Come back to me"", probably influenced by a cold and uninterested orchestra, which seems to play just because they are paid for. Sinatra's voice doesn't even sound as smooth as it should, just listen to his hard voice in ""Poor butterfly"". And what can be said about the repertoire, how can any producer loose the opportunity of having The voice sing the great songs of The Duke with the latter at the piano. The final result is a record that seems to sound like a Basie without any talent or interest. I think it is only ment for those (like me) who like to have everything Sinatra recorded. Disappointing."
1,Waste of Money,I've had these phones about ten months and I am very disappointed. The range is awful; move to another room or 40 feet from the base and you'll hear heavy static. The handsets don't hold a charge for a prolonged period anymore. A friend of mine had also purchased a set and has the same problems. This model is not worth purchasing at any price.
1,Disappointed,Bought these a few months ago and they are very disappointing. The range is poor and after only a few months neither one holds a charge longer than 10 minutes. Ignore these
5,Excellent Book,The Yarnell's go through all the major points of getting your new network marketing business off on the right foot. This book should definitely be required reading for anyone in the industry.
5,A must read. Great scripts and techniques,"As a National Trainer for a unique service based netwrok marketing company, I find the scripts and verbage in this book invaluable. Just couldn't put it down once I started on it. Almost all conceivable objections are answered step by step. All one has to do is read and repeat. The down to earth advice and reality checks are critical to the first year novices chances of survival. Although a little long in length, the book should be a 'must read' for all those that are new to network marketing. Also questionable is the advice that one doesnt need to know the product/service as much as the opportunity. As with any other industry, there are different ways of doing business, and the yarnells are offering their own experiences. Overall a good book."
5,A MUST......,"Definitely a must read for those of us new to network marketing. At 63, starting a new MLM career with only one marketing course at university (many years ago) and an inexplainable lifetime aversion to sales......this book was my best helper in getting me started on the right foot...and enough info to keep me marching on...... My family needs for me to succeed in this business and there is not a doubt in my mind that I will.....many thanks to the Yarnells......"
3,Just can't get into it!,"Honestly, I just can't get into this book. I am having a hard time getting past the first few pages. I personally think it is the set up of the pages to be blunt. I have read some good stuff as I have skimmed through the book and read eye-catching sections, but for me to sit down and read this book and highlight the good stuff and take notes--- yea, well it is just not happening with this one.Information wise, what I am reading is good- This couple certainly hits both sides - the misconceptions and well as the reality of the network marketing world.One thing I do like is the summary at the end of each chapter (one reason is becaus eit is a different font and page set so it is easier to follow) but mainly because it really does highlight the good parts of the chapter.Happy Selling!

2,The Right Music played on the Wrong Organ!,"I'm no purist! I have heard plenty of organs and recordings of organs - not French, in which I heard musical and satisfying performances of the music of Louis Vierne. However, I bought this recording because I longed to hear this beautiful suite but what a disappointment. This instrument lacks the subtle resources to do this music justice and Mr. Kaunzinger's interpetation and registrations leaves much to be desired. A much better recording would be Mr. Wolfgang Rubisam's on the Cavaille-Coll at Lyon."
5,Excellent story!,My wife recently took a trip to Israel and commented that she only wished she had read this book before the trip.
4,Very nice,"In replacing some very old slippers, I found these available in my magical much needed size of 12EEE. Although it's a bit of a ""Chinese"" size (meaning it's closer to 12EE and not 12EEE), they are still well made and very good at insulating against cold floors and such. So far I'm quite happy with them."
2,odd sizing,Normally my husband can wear an 11 easily (he is a 10.5) but this slipper is very narrow and super tight on him. Must return.
3,No half sizes,"Great slipper...if it fit. Too snug, but would be perfect if 1/2 size larger. And they don't make half sizes, e.g., 11 1/2. Item returned."
4,Good slippers,"I bought these for my husband and he is very particular. He is a man of few words; but he says they are very good skippers, very comfortable, and appear to be very good quality. When I asked him if he loved them (rating scale 5), he said he could never say he loved any ""slippers."" But I noticed he had been wearing another pair of slippers that were only a couple of weeks old when I gave him these; he set those aside and he started wearing these. That's a very good compliment to their comfort."
5,A Unique Book,"This is one of my favorite books which I first read many years ago. The author is very entertaining while giving an historical look back into real events in the lives of both he and his parents. However, the tremendous spiritual richness of God moving so powerfully in the lives of these individuals is absolutely astonishing at many points. This volume will make for lively discussions in virtually any adult Bible class setting. An extremely worth-while read!"
2,AOL proprietary?,I bought this book for my mother who is just now learning to use a computer. (she's in her 60's) I had high hopes based on the description provided. My problem is that the main area she needs help with is using email. This book only deals with AOL...not anything about Outlook Express at all. I was very disapointed to learn this. I returned the book.
1,What A Disappointment,"Oh how I wanted to like this breadbox! When it arrived I opened the carton and as I started to take it out and place it on the counter I noticed that the roll top was not attached and actually flopping around on the interior of the box. As I'm trying to retrieve the top to see if it would attach to the interior sides, lo and behold, both ends came off! I'm now left with two detached ends, one roll top and a sheet of very flimsy stainless. Couldn't even put it back together well enough to stick it back in the shipping carton so just ""poured"" all pieces in separately. Just horrible. If I could have given it ""0"" stars I would have."
4,Good Ol' Pop,"This is a good release, the best of the AI gang. It's definitely a pop album with tinges of r&b, but she does get it right. 17, Don't Stop, Good Ol' Days are gems. There's a solid bunch of good songs, and a couple of fillers (but what album doesn't have those). She does have an amazing voice, and it's not drowned by the music as is the case so often these days. Overall a very good pop release."
5,Encouraging Debut,"Tamyra is a promising young talent and this is an encouraging debut. She has a lot to offer the music world so I hope people take time to listen. This is a worthy writing effort. Unlike others, I don't find the lyrics juvenile. They're just simple and pleasant. Nothing wrong with that. Please give Tamyra a chance."
1,Horrible!!!!,"This is one of the WORST cds I have ever heard!!!! I don't even have it, I just listen to 30 second clips of all the songs and they suck. DO NOT buy this cd under any circumstances!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Very superb debut! Worth the two-year wait!,"I was just floored after hearing Tamyra Gray's album! She sounds so good on all the songs. The uptempo songs are all catchy! The ballads are nice. I definitely like ""17"" ""Raindrops Will Fall"" and others. She has such incredible range vocally. I like the fact that she wrote 12 or 13 songs, because you can tell it's coming from her on all levels! She might be the next great songwriter for the next few years or so."
4,Best AI CD,I'm a casual AI fan but some how own every CD the winners or runners up have issued. Tamyra's is by far the best. I knew she had a great voice but I was never a fan. This CD blew me away! It is funky and soulful with hooks and great singing everywhere. I hope it gets the attention is deserves.
3,why do people have to compare every idol cd,I have listen to songs from alot of the idols cd that have come out .And all i have to say why do people have to compare each idol cd to other idol cd why ? Can you answer that question for me cause i don't get why do they.Each person that comes from that show is talnted and haves there own stlye of music that can appeal to alot of people . It doesn't make them look better and just makes them look worse cause the way there fans are acting.Now me i'm a big Kelly Clarkson fan but i don't go putting other idols down . So please stop comparing its not a compation thank you for reading this.I'm sorry if i offended anyone but all this comparing needs to stop.
2,Very Disappointed,"After hearing rumors that Tamyra was working with Babyface, I got excited about who I considered the true winner of the first season of AI. I got the album and was VERY disappointed. While I believe that she has a good singing voice, the songs were very elementary. The inspirational songs were decent, but the album sounded too pop for my taste. I was really hoping that this album would be a little more soulful and mature. The producers on this album sucked!!! I hope that she will be able to try this again. However, considering the current state of the music industry, this might have been her only chance to shine. I wish the best for her in her future."
1,Very disappointing,"Although Tamyra was not my favorite Idol on Season One, I did think that she was very talented, which is why I am so disappointed with her debut CD. What happened? She had two years to work on this album. Her voice sounds OK but the songs are boring and the lyrics are laughable. I do not recommend this CD."
1,Disappointed,"I bought the cd because I loved Tamyra on American Idol. I have been waiting patiently for this release and was so excited when I saw that it was finally coming out! It HAD to be great, right? She had two years to put it together, she had written the whole cd and her voice is GREAT! Well, let me just say that it didn't even come close to meeting my expectations. The girl is NOT a good song writer. The songs are eh all around, minus one song (17) and something has happened to her voice. She sounds ok to good on the cd, but her live performances have been VERY subpar.I am glad I supported her by buying the cd, she is a great girl, but I would not recommend buying it to anyone. There is one good song, two passable one's ( Legend and Star ) and the rest is dreck.Maybe next time Tamyra, but I will wait to hear the material first."
1,The album is a flop,"After working two years on this album, I really thought Tamyra's debut would have been better. The album has been receiving quite a ""yawn"" from the American public. Her debut on Billboard was lower than any of the other idols at #23, with the exception of William Hung. Last week her album dropped over 50% to #65. The songs and lyrics are dated and I think Tamyra would have been better off having someone else write her music. If you buy this album, you will be disappointed. I know I was."
5,Smooth and Refreshing,Tamyra adds a new flavor to an old sound and it's enchanting. Her style is smooth and non-abrasive. Each song flows elegantly into the next. The latter is actually one of the most surprising elements. The seamless arrangement of the songs on the CD makes it really easy to listen to. This debut is confident and her vocal delivery on each song reminds you that she's a veteran on the inside. I look forward to her second album. I highly recommend this CD.
5,True talent prevails.,Tamyra delivers! Her vocals are magnificent and her songwriter skills are great for a first timer. This CD is a great constrast from what is going on with most RnB females these days. It's a refreshing change. Great to be a fellow Georgian..
5,Simply Wonderful,"I purchased 3 CD's this morning and was blown away!!! Her song writing skills are far beyond her years... I absolutley loved this CD and was pleansantly surprised by her vocal range and sophistication. Check out #5 ha ha!!!! It is grammy worthy and so was #3 legend, #2 the only thing #4raindrops #9 faces!!! heck the entire CD is awesome!!!! Strongly recommend this CD....!!!!!"
1,Bland,"As an American Idol viewer who enjoyed the previous albums of Kelly Clarkson, Clay aiken, Justin Guarini and Ruben Studdard, I was looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, I came away utterly disapointed. There is nothing original, nothing new to Tamyra's songs. Her voice is overproduced on several of the tracks and on many the lyrics lack musicality. They run on and on like a letter more so than a song. Maybe Miss. Gray would have been better off letting Clive Davis or someone else pick some good songs for her, or maybe she should have opted for a more entertaining product. I feel like I'm listening to the same song over and over.In a word. It's bland."
2,CHEESY DEBUT!!!!!!,"I love(d) Tamyra on season one of AI. I thought that she was an AMAZING talent, and I still believe that. After hearing her album, I am starting to think that she is nothing more than a karaoke singer. Her lyrics are full of boring cliché's and her songs are pretty bland. Her voice is not fully exposed on this album. I am very dissapointed Tamyra!"
5,Cutest book!,My grandson LOVES it! Sturdy construction. Bright colors. It was a smaller size than I expected. I think that's because I didn't pay attention to the dimensions.
3,smallest book ever,"Great for on the go but only about 25 words in the whole book.Very small but colorful, not best deal."
1,way too small,When I received this book I couldn't beleive how small it was. About 1 in by 1 in is all! Don't waste your four dollars on this book!
3,About What You'd Expect,"These aren't top-of-the-line batteries or anything, but arrived in reasonable shape and had reasonable battery life. Do consider whether The Source or Radio Shack (or equivalent) have store-brand batteries in bulk packaging; their 16/24/32-packs tend to be better value than these batteries and work about the same. I wouldn't trust these in an emergency kit, though. Nor would I use them in any high-drain devices like a digital camera -- they'll work, but you'd be better served with half-decent NiMH rechargeable batteries."
3,Vespri Finally,"The good--Cerquetti owned one of the more fabulous Verdi sopranos of her time and wasn't unwilling to use it with gusto. She throws herself into the singing and delivers a performance of excitiment. Ortica,though not ideal in technique, offers drama and doesn't disappoint dramatically. Tagliabue and Christoff clean their musical and vocal plates with relish even if their parts aren't as big. Rossi keeps the music together without offending or inspiring. The bad--1955 Turin broadcast of a live performance, need I say more? It's clear enough, however, to keep our interest in this piece. The ugly--the ballet is omitted, either in the performance itself or, as I suspect, by the label company to keep it confined to two CDs. There are other cuts, but only die-hard fans of this opera need to worry. If you are a Cerquetti fan, it's a steal."
1,Those who can maybe shouldn't,Very poor instruction and poor cuing. They may know boxing but they aren't good at leading a class. Even the count pacing gets thrown off here and there. If you must try check it out from the library.
5,Worthwhile,"I found this story absolutely superb: cast, locations and content were authentically presented; the acting was flawless. To those of us who especially appreciate that era of history, it was also instsructive. I am sure I will view it another 6 times!"
5,LOVE THIS CD!!,"If you like RATT then you'll like this cd. Pearcy's voice is so unique and I think it's very underrated. The feel of listening to this cd is like you are sitting with Pearcy, chilling out, and he plays some of your favorite Ratt songs unplugged. Round and Round is a totally different version but it's a cool change and it grows on you. His versions of ""Bring it on Home"" and ""Oh Well"" were cool also. I recommend the cd to add to your Ratt OR Pearcy collection. Especially if you feel you just can't get enough of the 80's music or artists."
4,Good general book,"This is a great book for an overview of the total state. If you are looking for lots of info on one particular area this probably isn't what you are after, but it gives a good description of each area. We found it useful for our trip but not terribly in depth about each area."
3,Video input would be easier if the connector was female.,"On the front of the box it has ""SVGA extension cable"", but a standard extension cable does not work with this because both connectors have threaded nuts. It's easier to use a gender changer because it has the bolts, then use 3 standard SVGA cables.The best results were monitors with the same aspect ratio and screen resolution."
3,Caligula unrated version,"Caligula is a graphic account about the Roman ruler. The unrated version is so graphic that it's equal to an X-rated movie, even by today's standards. Caligula is an interesting movie, worth renting, and is very disturbing in it's violence and sexuality. There are multiple versions of Caligula available, I would recommend you get the unrated version as it will have the greatest impact."
3,Pink Fishnet thigh-highs,"This product was okay, and got here on time, but the top part that is designed to keep the fishnets up and in place was so tight on my thighs that it was cutting off my circulation and causing my legs to bulge out of the top and bottom. I'm only 120 pounds. Imagine how the 160 pound woman it claims to fit feels."
1,Only worked 3 months,"This coffeemaker worked well, but for only 3 months. There is nothing in the book about a warranty so guess it does not have one. I will not recommend this model."
1,Don't Buy Streets and Trips,"The software is highly inaccurate and therefore, unreliable. We have traveled in many states and have yet to have the software produce accurate information. Save yourself a lot of grief and buy a road atlas and city maps when you arrive at your destination.Furthermore, it does not allow you to name selected roads on the maps as you can in ""Road Trips Door to Door"". Possibly because they don't have the names in their database."
1,BE CAREFULL,After using MS S&T 98 for years we decide to upgrade to MS S&T2002. It would seem that our version of MS Outlook that came with Windows 98 was not up to the unspecified requirements of MS S&T2002 and it loaded new mail software. In the process our address book was destroyed!
2,PSEUDOBLUES!,"While this CD is listed as ""blues"", there is little in the way of blues here unless, of course, you count Robben Ford's guest appearance on one track as enough to qualify this as a blues recording. One listen to this CD and you will soon realize why there was only one recording released by these three individuals. Nothing notable here!"
2,Must be a better book,There is a problem in getting an easy tutorial for Vegas Movie Studio but this is not it. The book is full of jargon and not too helpful in learning. The examples are woven into the text making it difficult to follow explanations.I would not recommend as a source of learning Movie Studio
4,I found this text very helpful,"I used this book for a course in library research and found it clear, helpful, and detailed. I was very satisfied with the text and relied on it for developing a solid research proposal."
3,The Nutcracker,I had seen a better version of this ballet with Edward Villilleva(splg?) This version dropped several of the other standard characters and was not up to my standards. I have probably seen about 20 versions by now.
3,The Menopause Diet,"Larrian Gillespie seems to have comprehensive knowledge as to the mechanics of the digestive system, how it is affected by hormones, and the part they play in determining the insulin levels in the body. However, I think she tends to be an alarmist when it comes to the loss of estrogen in the female system. She is very definitely pro HRT. There is no balance. She doesn't present the other side of the HRT question. In her opinion, HRT is the only way to go.I couldn't believe it when I saw that one of her recipies even calls for Nutra-Sweet!"
4,"technical, but useful",i found this book to be very benificial in learning about the menopause and how it really affects us in a biological way. I wasnt looking for a 'diet' book and this fitted the bill very well. It was hard reading sometimes and i had to re read certain parts before it stuck. I use it often and would recomend it to someone who wants to understand the menopause ina deeper way yo to beat it.
3,The Menopause Diet,"This book had a lot of good information, but didn't quite live up to my expectations. I found it to be too medically technical in most areas. A simple do and don't section would have been more beneficial to the average person who doesn't have a medical background. I found the menus to be quite cumbersome to prepare. In my schedule I don't have the time to prepare such meals with hard to find ingredients in some instances. I was hoping for simple, basic menus that could be prepared without much fanfare, since I work full time and the meals in the book would take a full time chef to prepare. The book didn't even go into the use of herbals such as black cohash, etc. to find out a snapshot of what herbs work best in conjunction with other supplements. Bottom line, this book was too technical and not an easy read. I was disappointed after having read and appreciated ""You don't have to live with Cystitis"", also by Dr. Gillespie."
1,I couldn't even finish it,"I don't know, this book was rambling, dull, boring, etc. I couldn't even get past chapter three before I had to just put it away. I just couldn't get into it. The only reason I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 is because it had an interesting idea behind it. I love vampire books, they are my favorite to read, but trust me, you are better off reading something else."
2,Just OK for Supplement,I have gone thorough Java 2 Unleashed by same author and I had high expectations about this one.But I didn't find that useful. Author has not taken any effort to make it understandable and it is very brief and I found other books much better. But I think it may be useful for Architect exam.
2,Nothing but CD-ROM ...,"This book is well-organzied at once but in fact, it has lots of typos and mistakes. Like some question numbers and answers do NOT match. It says it covers up Architecture test and developer at all but the sections for those tests are really tiny. nevertheless the CD-ROM inside this is quite worth to try. however, except that, nothing to read."
4,Your best bet!,"Sailed through the exam with a score of 85% in the first shot. Its a wonderful book as it is completely focussed on the exam without the digressions the other books usually have. Yes, there are a couple of typos but a keen reader would spot them out easily (and that would reinforce the correct concept too!). The book is worth its price. So buddy, go get it. Thy shall succeed."
1,looks good but not enough details to pass the exam,I have been programming in Java for 4 years now and I did not pass the exam just by studying this book. For example the exam asked alot of questions about inner classes (15-20%) and this book only cover inner classes for 2-3 pages. The book doesn't describe inner classes very details and the practice exam is terrible. The real exam is far from the practice exam. The bottom line is I do not recommending this book!
2,Not worth the price,"I mistakenly thought that this book was a Deep Space 9(DS9) book, but it is not. The only DS9 character is Jake, and even he is not in all of the book. Instead it talks about the crew of the ship he is on, and none of them are really that interesting. I thought the end of the book made no sense whatsoever. This book is definitely not worth the price being charged."
1,Wish I'd Skipped This One,"I enjoyed the two ""Avatar"" books, but really had problems with this one. I agree with everyone who said that most of the middle of the book could have been skipped--all about a bunch of aliens with unpronounceable names ""Aslylgof,"" ""Srral,"" and ""Lemakinstessithingamawhatzit"" to mention a few, who then go away at the end of the book, probably never to be heard from again. What was the point? I realize this is science fiction, but a mysterious deck called the Wa with floating spots that take you other places? C'mon!Jack was never my favorite character anyway, and I just wanted to get off the ""Even Odds"" and back to the station. I probably shouldn't have bought this one."
4,4 comics in one book =),"Much like The Simpsons comic books. The drawings are as we remember them from the tv-show, and they are good... The stories are kinda good, the characters talk and behave as they should. If you like comics and Futurama then buy, if you don't like comics then go buy the dvd set's ;)"
3,kinda boring,"i was dissapointed in this book. the jokes arent funny, and the story drags on.the drawings and color are great. buy it if you are a fan. otherwise.. no"
5,great read for waiting for plane,"I bought this book right before i went on my vacation to germany in july, i read most of it while i was waiting for our plane to arrive, I really got sucked into it. Unfortunately i later found out i can not read on planes. So this became the book type thing to read before each one of our planes. I really got sucked into the futurama universe with these, so much so that i thought later that i had actually watched those episodes, and would say phrases outloud from them and other futurama fans(who haven't read the book) didn't know where it came from. I kept getting the giant lobster one mixed up with the show, where leela eats zoidberg; oddly enough, that is probably the comic i get mised up with the show the most often. I savored this read so that i read it within each time getting on planes, so i had something to read on the trains to austria, and czech republic. I like it so much i read it again memorzing quotes from it, so i could repeat them outloud."
2,Doesn't Measure Up,The good points...1) Reasonable Price2) Attractive Design3) Makes a good pot of CoffeeThe bad points...1)Temperature is not hot enough - I often have to microwave my cup of joe for a few seconds to get it up to what I prefer.2) Often leaks - have to clean up puddles underneath pot.3) Touchy drip sensor - sometimes water is not allowed into carafe - I have to put carafe with the handle all the way to the left - don't ask me why but this is the only position that it works4) Did not work for very long. Mine just kicked the bucket after only 6 months.I have to buy another coffee maker today and will not be purchasing another Black & Decker
4,Great coffeemaker for the price,"It seems like coffeemakers die on us about every 2 or 3 years, no matter what brand they are, so we tend to aim for the lower end of the market. This Black & Decker unit gets the job done admirably and has all the features we want or need. We wish it was 12 cups instead of 10, but that's a small inconvenience. Also, it takes cone-shaped filters instead of flat ones (of which we have several boxes), but again, that's a small issue and not really something to obsess about. We spent the money we saved over buying a Braun or something fancier than B&D on a reverse osmosis system so we could have really good water to make coffee, and we've found that having good water makes a huge difference in how the coffee tastes (plus, it means there's no lime build-up inside the machine)."
1,Poorly Designed and Cheaply Made,I bought this and returned it immediately. The design is terrible and very hard to manage. The coffee grounds spilled over every time I made coffee. The cone filter is held in by a tiny speck of plastic which I am sure will break. This is cheap and not worth the money.
1,Junk Do Not Buy!,This coffee pot is junk! My husband bought this for me for Christmas in 2006. Coffee was not that good. I wanted a Braun Coffee Pot. :-(Here it is Nov. 2007 did not get even 1 whole year out if it and it will not brew coffee. :-(Save your money! Super JUNK!
5,Great resource for those in PV industry,"Many great, clear explanations of subjects either omitted or glazed over in other resources. The breadth of this book is impressive and it is well-written, very easy to read. Of the 8 or 9 books I own relating to renewable energy, this is my favorite."
4,Love them!!,"Bought these to go in my giants themed bathroom. i love them, but i do worry that the print will start to come off after a few washes. time will tell!"
2,"Zyxel ADSL modem, 600 series.","I bought this brand of modem because my ISP (Earthlink) uses it and assured me that they would be able to assist me with the initial setup. They were unable to do so after multiple, several hour, phone calls. They alternately said the problem was with the modem, then the PC, then the other PC I tried to set it up with. The PCs use different OSs, and are different brands, so I doubt the PCs are the problem. However, I doubt the modem is bad either. My advice is to not buy a Zyxel modem if you use Earthlink, as they are unable to help you get them to work."
2,EarthLink Wouldn't Support This Modem,"The modem passed all the standard tests, but I couldn't connect to my ISP, EarthLink. EarthLink wouldn't support this modem because they didn't sell it to me, even though it is one of the models they sell (for about twice the price). If your ISP is EarthLink, beware! I believe (my conjecture -- may or not be correct) that when EarthLink sells you a modem or provides one, they associate its MAC address with your account. (Their technicians deny that, or don't know.) If you change modems on your own, it won't work. I returned the modem (although there was likely nothing wrong with it), cancelled EarthLink, and went with another ISP (who provided a router!)."
1,Not compatible,This modem is not compatible with Century Link broadband. It is apparently and older item and does not work with current ADSL provided by this carrier.
3,"""Nice try, You almost did it!""","At first glance it appears that Mr. Stier did a remarkable job. The map edition to the History of Tamerlane is very much needed for his campaigns to be figured out. However, even though some of the places are still unknown, the maps are somewhat misleading with Amir Timur going to places that he never really did reach. Also, the campaigns do not follow the excepted pattern established by Sherif Ad-Din. Mr. Stier's presentations of Timur's conquests are a little choppy. What was his main source?In my book, ""The Campaigns of Tamerlane,"" (still to be published) which IS based on Sherif ad-Din's book; H. H. Howorth"" works; E. Bretschneider; V.V. Barthold; Le Strange; and The Tarkhi-i-Rashidi, among others, I have located many of the places Timur went to on his campaigns, and in correct order. I only wish he had consulted with me before he went to press. We could have made a great team."
3,Comprehensive but at times tedious.,Content drawn from extensive bibliography but writing style somewhat boring. The author obviously admires his subject to the extent of being an apologist for him.
5,Great product,Love this! It's easy to put it on the wall and it stays up! And I love that the pieces can be arranged in different ways depending on your space.
2,Not Adult Size,Very disappointed in this purchase. It's much tinier than it appears. I gave it to a child instead of the adult I purchased it for.
5,Very Entertaining!,"I received this book as a gift and since I like historical novels, I started reading it right away. This is a great book! The plot was great and I really liked the characters, especially Rolf. There was plenty of action, some ""read it several times"" sex, and just the right mix of fantasy and fact to keep me turning the pages. I highly recommend this novel to anyone who likes WWII, especially North Africa & the Afrika Korps, but even more so to people who enjoy a good story."
1,Fact or Fiction,"This book is nothing more than a work of fiction. Dana singlehandedly ran Tenneco into the ground. He leaves out the part about transferring shareholder wealth into his own pocket. And where is the part about moving to Greenwich because his wife didn`t like Houston? The title of this book should be Low Standards, Easy Money: How to Get Rich by Destroying a Company."
5,Top notch book...but,"Very well crafted. Has the feel of the era throughout. Lots of research. Hard to put down. Loved it and recommend it. (I have the 1994 edition and can't speak for the new expanded edition. I just re-read it due to the Johnny Depp hoopla happening now). It flows like good fiction.I'm also a fan of Robert Nash's ""Dillinger Dossier"" if your looking for more J.D. literature.He takes the story to a whole new level."
1,"Lets remember, the guy was a criminal","The authors seem to have forgotten the basics behind Dillinger, the guy was a cold blooded killer and thief...okay granted, a colorful and charming killer and thief, but a lowlife just the same. Instead, what we seem to get a glowing reivew of Dillingers life in crime, killing innocent cops who were doing their jobs and taking hard earned cash away from people who worked long and hard to make it and save it....in the depression."
1,"Cloying, grandpa-in-the-sky book","AGE: 2-5FORMAT: Cutesy illustration of a modern child on left side, Bible verse with exposition on right. 44 spreads.COMMENTS: The Bible verses are all in King James, which is horribly inappropriate for the targeted age range. The expository portions are often scarcely related to the verse, and all too often, they make wild, inaccurate claims about what the passage means. If a child truly believes this book, the first time he scrapes a knee or loses a pet, his faith will be shattered. The God portrayed in this book keeps anything bad from ever happening to any of His followers.USEFULNESS: You might use it to come up with Bible verses for memorization, but you'd want to use a more accessible version for such young kids, anyway, so why bother? The expository sections are pretty much worthless."
5,Good bang for the Buck!,"The sound quality is excellent for the price range. Great for a small room. This unit has a lot of features that are only seen in models costing ...more! cd-r & cd-rw compatible, autoreverse cassette player."
1,Don't buy this book!,"Last year for Calc AB, I relied mostly on my notes nd managed to get a 4. This year my teacher was horrible nd I actually tried to use this book to review BC material nd I could not understand it. I think I got a 3 or 4. The questions are way too difficult. Also, you can tell this book wont help you when you look to the explanation to understand a question and it gives a one sentence answer which means nothing. I used barrons for my SAT I math and got a 790. Most of its books are good, but this one surely isnt. You're better off with the Arco, CliffsAP, or even Princeton review. anything but Barrons!"
3,a bit harder than actual test,"I bought two books, barrons' and Princeton's. The former was much harder to understand and contains more information than the latter. When I studiedPrinceton's, I was relieved, but when I studied barrons Ibecame afraid that the test was really that hard. However,when I took the real test, I found that the actual testwas more like Princeton's than Barrons'; and I got 5 onthe exam. I recommend you to buy this book for experiencingthe hardest questions that would be on the actual exam.If you only use Princeton's, you may be frustrated to findthat there are some questions that aren't on the Princeton'spractice exams."
4,AP Calculus,"It's concise and clear for a review book. No use if you're LEARNING form it though, since it's designed to invoke and strengthen memory rather than to explain and teach. Great, challenging questions with good explanations."
5,Amazing Calc. prep book.,"This book is great for calculus, whether you're taking the AP calc test or not. It has many of the basic tricky questions that teacher my try to give you on tests and also shows you how to solve them so that when you see the AP test, you'll know what to do. It's also in a very easy to understand format and tons of practice questions. I got a 5 on the AP Calc. AB exam, so I think it helped."
3,Strange Ending,"I usually love anything that Stella Cameron writes but this book was very strange. The book was fast paced, but the ending was so awful...I still don't have a clue to what happened to anyone. If this storyline is going to continue in another book - that should have been noted . . Even so she should have done an epilogue to give the readers a clue of what happened.."
4,Works great on old keyboards.,"Got this for my Microsoft Natural Keyboard (1995).It works almost flawlessly. Once in a while, like maybe 2-3 times a week, it will ""reset"" it's connection for a spit second. During that second, the keyboard lights will light up and I cannot type. But besides that, I am able you use this on a variaty of machines with only USB support.The case for the converter is very bad. You can easily twist the cable and the case will almost pop open. Just don't touch it and you should be fine."
5,Solid Performance,"Finally, a USB/PS-2 adapter that works consistently with my IBM Model-M keyboard through a Linksys SVIEW04 KVM switch. No glitches, no stuck keys, no dropping held Ctrl/Alt/Shift keys, and no erratic mouse movements. All good, no funkiness."
2,Adapter ignores keystrokes periodically,"The adapter works flawlessly until I start doing any long typing sessions. Periodically the keyboard's LEDs (caps lock, number lock, & scroll lock) blink and for the next second or so, my keyboard input is ignored. This is the only reason I gave it only two stars.My IBM Model-M keyboard works flawlessly on any PC with an on-board PS/2 port. I only tested this product using Debian Linux, which shouldn't make a difference since this product is *supposed* to be a standard USB human interface device."
2,"Started out good, but...","Well, this seemed like a good item, it's used on a little thin client that is used as an alternative machine that is basically used just to listen to Internet streaming audio on weekends only.It worked great for about 4 months, then all of a sudden, the part of the device that handles the interface for the mouse died, the keyboard section still works and luckily the thin client has an available PS/2 port that can be used for the mouse with separately, so all is not lost, but it was better when the mouse used the USB port as the device was designed to do and simply sending it back for a partial refund just wasn't practical nor worth the effort."
2,Didn't work for me,"I bought this adapter so that I could use an older PS2 keyboard with a Dell Inspiron notebook that only has USB slots. I plugged it in, and the keyboard worked for a few hours. But then I started to have problems. Sometimes all of the keyboard lights flash (caps lock, num lock, etc), and the keyboard stops responding. Or else it will suddenly turn on the caps lock, or it acts as though the shift keys are being held down. I also found some odd behavior with my web browser while I had it plugged in. I unplugged the adapter and the problem went away. I have gone through this same cycle 3 times now. So although most people seem to have had success with this device, it didn't work for me."
5,Adesso PS/2 to USB Adapter,"Adesso PS/2 to USB Adapter, connects 2 PS/2 connectors to 1 USB port/hub (ADP-PU21 )I bought this adapter for my new laptop so that I could use my wireless keyboard and mouse. Laptop keyboards are often way too compact and a cumbersome adjustment from a regular sized keyboard. Works great, wonderful value. Most newer laptops do not have PS/2 inputs for keyboards...so if you're looking to connect your wireless mouse and keyboard, this is exactly what you need!"
3,Good but poorly made,"This product is good, it works well and allows all keyboard and mouse functions. It is poorly made and rather fragile. I actually had to use duct tape to ""bandaid"" around it within just 2 days of receiving it."
1,Did not work with my Thinkpad,"This did not work for connecting my Lenovo Thinkpad with a wireless mouse and keyboard. I tried to return it, but they would not let me."
5,Excellent Product,"I connected my old, IBM-type keyboard that I used with my old PC to my Mac G5. It works perfectly - no delays. I keep my Mac keyboard connected to my Mac, too, so I can use the Mac-specific command keys. I am a writer and a typist; therefore I wanted a real keyboard with the proper key spacing that I could type fast and comfortably on. I read the Amazon customer reviews before purchasing, suggesting spending a few dollars more and getting a product that actually works. I highly recommend this Adesso adapter. I am a happy camper."
4,works like a champ,"I got this for my first son, he has just started sleeping in his crib/room and no longer in mine; being his room is upstairs from mine, I wanted a way to easily check on him. This camera does that! While the LCD on the handheld is small, it is big enough to see what is going on in full color during the day and b/w at night with it night vision. I do wish the power cord was longer, as you need to keep it high, looking down to get the best views.Setup only took minutes.Pros:Good color, good clarity, uses batteries and AC adapterCons:shorter power cord, small LCD screen"
1,"Not endorsed, not recommended","This book has failed to receive endorsement by the US Catholic Bishops. If you are looking for a book that will give you an accurate picture of what Catholicism teaches, this book will not provide an accurate picture. A much better choice for those looking for an authentic and encompassing picture of the Catholic Church would be the Catechism of the Catholic Church."
5,A MUST read for ANY Catholic,"McBrien certainly knows his theology and he does a wonderful job of covering EVERY major issue facing Catholicism today and he examines each issue from every side. It can be extremely difficult to follow at times and is very comprehensive, but worth the effort!"
5,Summary of Development of Catholic Doctrine,"This is an ideal text for people who want a source for serious study of the Catholic religion. Although I am not a priest, I graduated from a Catholic college seminary around the time of Vatican II and have maintained a serious interest in my religion since that time. We intelligent adults are often left with two sources of information about our Church: (1) the superficial utterings of the popular press, and (2) the defensive writings of the Church in such sources as the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Although he has been routinely denounced by fundamentalist Catholics as a ""liberal,"" McBrien actually presents a balanced view on important issues."
5,Fantastic,This was actually a fantastic read. Bought it for a class and really enjoyed reading it. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in biomedical science
1,Can't believe Aiwa put their name on this piece of junk!,"Has neither auto-reverse nor auto-stop. Has cheap, tinny sound. No button to open the cassette door, you must pull it open manually, like much cheaper recorders. I have only been able to run it on batteries: it requires an 120 VAC to 6 VDC adaptor, but it came with a 230 VAC adaptor, obviously not intended for sale in the U.S. I reported the problem to the vendor, who promised to send the proper adaptor in a few days, but several weeks later I am still waiting and they aren't answering my messages."
3,Roy Smeck Guitar Chords,"This book provides the many various chord positions, and for each, identifies the most common positions of each. The spiral version I received is very handy and makes it easy to access the pages. Though in very good condition, the book appears to be old, based on the printed price on the cover page. Overall, worth the price."
3,NOT mac compatible,"So far, everything is fine when connected to my husband's PC. However, the frame is very much not workable on my Mac, which stores all our family photos. Disappointing, particularly when it specifically advertises being mac compatible."
5,BUY IT!,It is a journey that will be very difficult to forget.Even if you never tried meditation before listen to this.All you have to do is close your eyes and relax very soon you are going to find yourself in a world of sounds combined with colorfull pictures.I believe it is worthy to eperience it.
2,Buy Brainwave Suite instead of this.,"As an owner of Thompson's Brainwave Suite, I am quite disappointed in Brainwave Journey. The music and sounds are outstanding, but the voice track is annoying and distracting.The voice is a strange, electronic babble. This is unfortunate, and unnessary. The music could stand alone to inspire your mind to travel into a relaxed, positive mental journey.My frustration grew intense after a couple of months that I gave away this box set, and have since replaced it with some wonderful collections by Hearts of Space."
5,Friends in Autumn Jigsaw Puzzle,"Friends in Autumn is a beautiful 1000 piece puzzle, measuring 24"" x 30"".This puzzle beautifully depicts the painting ""Friends in Autumn"" by Fred Swan. The setting is a country home and barn nestled in the valley at the peak of fall.You'll love it."
4,Nice Puzzle,Very enjoyable puzzle. Probably spent 3 days off and on between 4 people assembling everything but the sky ... the sky may take 3 more days.
3,"Not what I imagined, ONE microscopic diamond awkwardly placed","There was only ONE microscopic diamond awkwardly placed on one of the ""x's"" between the simulated stones. It wasn't even in the center of the ""x."" From the photo, it seems like there are many small diamonds on each ""x."" Guess you get what you paid for, and in the end the bracelet was too large, so the jeweler was instructed to omit that particular link. Pass it up if you're buying for the glitz of diamonds otherwise the simulated tanzanite is beautiful."
1,don't use this to just sit in your wooden instrument,"this is a great and quick easy spit remover. however, don't let it sit in your horn letting the moisture eat away your wooden instrument. Don't be lazy, use a rubber covered swab to properly clean your instrument."
1,Victorian Chic was neither victorian nor chic.........,"I buy all the home decor and design books that come out. I am especially drawn to the books that encompass the flea market, antiques, and shabby chic styles. I was prematurely excited at the idea of Victorian Chic. This book failed to deliever. In fact, it quickly became the most dissatifying home decor book that I had purchased in the past 10 years. The author seemed to totally miss her objective. The book really did not address adding victorian items into your decor. Instead, it appeared to be discount store items that were added to the rooms shown.There was very little to no victorian influences noted and there was certainly nothing chic about any of the decors. It appears that the author attempted to take from Rachell Ashwell and make a buck by targeting Victorian Chic, but missed. It was simply a very bad imitation of the ideas of Shabby Chic."
2,Inconsistent,"Frank Polite, Flamingo (Pangborn, 1990)From the ""just because it's on a press doesn't make it better than self-published stuff"" files comes Flamingo, a collection of poetry and short prose pieces from Frank Polite. When Frank is good, he is very, very good; when Frank is bad...This is without doubt a personal preference, but I have always had a problem with pieces where the author steps into an already-established scene. Polite does this repeatedly (most egregiously, he writes himself into Casablanca), and the pieces where he does it drive me up the wall. That said, among the rest of the book, there will once in a while be a gem. Those gems are too few and far between to make this a recommended book. It's certainly not worth the outrageous price the only copy presently on Amazon is commanding. **"
4,An Adorable Book,"I added this book to my registry because I'd always heard great things about Baby Einstein books. The price was really nice too, so one of my friends bought it for me, and I was surprised when I got the book because it is reaaaalllly little! It's a sturby board book though, and the theme of it is that on one page is descriptive test about dogs and puppies, and on the other page are various pictures of canines: Some of these are drawings by other children, some are cartoons, and some are famous works of art that include pictures of dogs.I love the idea of this book, because I want to introduce various forms of art to my child at an early age. The small size makes them a bit imposible for younger children though--Newborns can only see bright and large colors and images, so until they are old enough to differentiate the pictures better, it will just sit on the shelf."
4,Tightest player ever owned,"Was an awesome player(fell off roof of car on highway and couldnt find when i realized i left it and went back.. OOOPPSS), played every cd i had NEVER skipped. Good bass although i would recomend getting bigger headphones, then again no portable cd player comes with good headphones. Had this player for almost a year. Dropped it, ran it over while biking, you name it. CD player is almost flawless. Good Tuner better then the sony i used to own, my only complaints are you have to put the bass on only half way when you crank the volume to max and it's akward look. Good battery life, as the manual says you get better battery life with the antiskip on full then with half on or all the way off."
2,"boring, innocuous","Minimally interesting. Most of the CEOs seem to be just spouting innocuous platitudes. Usually about how well their company is doing, etc etc. Reading this book is like sitting through a set of boring speeches at some political gathering. Like Khandros' ""Building a Winning Company for the Long Haul"". The information content in that was very minimal.Far more interesting would have been some no holds barred analysis of a CEO's company relative to its competitors. Or perhaps a reasonably serious look at technology trends in that company's scope."
4,Solid Effort Yet Needs a Little Balance,"Murray's book is great for those who are considering becoming a financial advisor. It is polished and easy to read...Nick's writing about limiting account size minimums to $250,000 not realistic for most. Murray is good at presenting the ""Big Picture"" of being an advisor and the image to project...a good book for those pondering a career change to being an investment advisor."
2,Gets the Boylston Professor wrong,"The author of this guide has the wrong Channing serving as Harvard's Boylston Professor from 1819 to 1850. It was NOT William Ellery Channing (the famous Unitarian minister) who was Boylston Professor at Harvard during that period; it was his brother, Edward Tyrrel Channing. Check the facts and the truth will follow."
5,Loved it,"This was my first Julie Anne Long book and I cannot wait to read more from this fabulous author. Her characters are so easy to imagine, so realistic. The plot was very interesting as well. It was hard to put down. Very steamy romance too. I'm excited to read about the other sisters."
3,Ok but not as heartwarming as previous,"I first read Long's TO LOVE A THIEF and was enchanted with her pygmalion story. But somehow Kit and Susannah just never caught my fancy as well as Gideon and Lily. Susannah is a bit too spoiled (reminding my of Jane Austen's Emma) and Kit behaves like an adolescent despite being a mature man of 37 (drinking, carousing with married ladies, and being set down by his daddy).Their relationship does proceed at a unique and nice pace for a Regency becoming employee/employer and friends first. But I don't buy the ""spy"" characterizations in the story. None of the spies seem particularly clever but instead driven by their own personal cravings. There's very little honor and duty among them."
1,Turned yellow after about 5 days,Now it looks like it has had cigarette smoke blown on it repeatedly even though no one I know smokes. I wouldn't buy again. Won't refund the shipping that is almost half the cost though if I did return per policy. I have contacted the company regarding getting a replacement - sent me black one instead and I love it. Recommend the black one
5,"Awesome, engaging show",Not much needs to be said with the numerous positive reviews on this season. It is an awesome show for anyone who enjoys a good drama that isnt drab 24/7. I would even go as far as that you can watch this season to start off and catch up easily with the previous seasons. A+
3,"No English subtitles, sub-par production for an excellent show.","I actually created this post to simply complain about the product feature that is missing: English subtitles!! This is, after all, a review of a product overall (not just the content within). Breaking Bad is certainly one of my favorite serials at the moment, and unfortunately since I live in a small house with a small child, I need to keep the volume down a lot of the time. The dialogue soundtrack is well-done, not over-compressed or too loud. But as a result, I NEED English-language subtitles. I can't comprehend how this could have been left out...it's such a standard feature in DVD productions today. I can think of very few DVDs in my home that are not captioned properly, and most of them are from very small or independent production studios.Excellent show, but I'm pretty disappointed with the lack of English-language captions."
4,I like Breaking Bad,I watched it until Comcast ripped the channel away. I got rid of cable so I now have to buy or rent these. Thanks for keeping me up on what is happening. I can hardly believe we are headed for a 4th season. Sopranos again.
2,netflix is more cost effective.,"I payed over $20 for season 3 of breaking bad. I could have paid 7.99 for seasons 1,2,3,and 4 on NETFLIX. Plus, the video quality and buffering time was ridiculous. Blame it on my Internet, but Netflix, Pandora, my laptop, and the playstation can all download and receive info twice as fast as Amazon."
5,Best Season Yet,One of my favorite shows. Do yourself a favor and watch this series in order. Do not watch this season without watching the seasons 1 and 2.
1,Dismal,"I just had to loan this book from the local library to see if the reviews here were at all accurate. They are. I'm not sure what the aim of this book is. Is it to give Finnish-Americans with an interest in new age gibberish some sort of connection to mythic, mystic past? That's my theory, because it certainly doesn't have much to do with bonafide Finnish history or culture.The authors carelessly intermingle Sami and Finnish cultural traditions, misspell or misuse Finnish words, and even worse, create something of a mockery of Finnish culture by creating this bizarre, frankly non-existent mismash of cultures and positing it as ""Finnish"". All I can say in conclusion is that I wish I could get back the time I wasted reading this horrid book."
4,Great player,I first purchased a cheap CD player for my daughter and found that the batteries had to be replaced just about every other day. I purchased this CD player on it battery usage alone. I had no idea how great this cd player really was. My daughter is 5 and uses this in the car during travel. Never a single problem and is easy enough for her to use.
3,Not for a 6 year old.,My grandson turned 6 and requested GI Joe stuff. I bought this one and another. He was interested for about 15 minutes. This is too advanced for his age. He also is not familiar with guns and war (thank GOD!) so I think he just THOUGHT he wanted GI JOE.
3,Fun,"It's a fun read, but not the best instructions. You'll be surprised by a lot of the things that you can use to clean items."
3,Creative disconnected wandering,"This author has a unique style. Having read many fantasy books, I very much appreciate anything unique. However, the book comes off more as a compendium of supernatural creatures and settings, than as a book driven by plot and character developement. I quite often felt distant from the characters and their ordeals. But, so what... this isn't a book where you get into what is happening, but it is a great book to gawk at the many wonders that come crawling, hopping, and dancing forth across the pages. She also has a weakness for analogy... some very nice, but laid on a bit thick (it's all in the spreading (you don't want your butter clumped up)). It is likely I will read further into the series... though I don't feel rushed to visit the book store."
2,Fantasy/Romance Novel,I read this when it first came out and wish I had stopped at that. The writing style is agonizing to read. The story and concept is excellent but the writing style drags on and on. I've never read a romance novel but I expect it would sound like many parts of this book. I read the whole series and unfortunately each one gets to be more and more like a romance novel. Reading this series was somewhat tolerable as you can just skip over pages and pages of the descriptive text and not miss a thing. It's really ashame because there was so much potential here and I really wanted to like this series. The faerie lore is the only redeeming quality and the reason for the second star.
1,awful writing,"I couldn't even finish this book. The writing is so pretentious and made my skin want to crawl. yuck, yuck, yuck."
5,fantasy addicts' heroin,For one who reads books with the belief that Prof. Tolkien cannot be bettered; I discovered Mrs Dart-Thornton. For not since the age of 12 have I been so completely enveloped in a story. And blessedly she's an Aussie! P.S. thanks for the echidna.
4,Very impressive,"All the hype comparing this book to Tolkien was sadly misleading. This author does a wonderful job of weaving her own world of fantasy, but maintains the tension that is normally ascribed to Robert Ludlum. The first 50 pages were admittedly hard going - that's why the 4/5, not 5/5. By the end I was suitably impressed enough to be waiting impatiently for the next instalment. If you want Hobbits, you should go somewhere else. If want swashbuckling adventure with depth of characters that you genuinely have feelings for, this is a very good read indeed."
1,Great for the fireplace...,"If there was the option for 0 stars, this book...and the entire trilogy would deserve it.The story in itself MIGHT have been interesting. I was so intrigued by a mute, disfigured protagonist and confident in the glowing reviews that I bought the entire trilogy. I wish I had read more reviews, because as many of the other readers have attested to---the story is completely lost in the author's rambling, boring, wordy, and frustrating descriptions. The entire time that I was reading, I kept WAITING for something to happen. The pretentious Cecilia Dart-Thornton is ten times worse than Robert Jordan in the later years; the worse I have ever read. She may have an astounding vocabulary, but she doesn't have what it takes to be a great writer---a person who knows how to tell a story and holds the reader in thrall.All I can say is...these books look great on my bookcase, but if I was a rich person and could waste money, then I would just throw them into the fireplace."
2,Pearls before .....,"This book is a box full of pearls of celtic mythology, much of which is rather repetitive. The language is mined from a thesaurus. (I have a good vocabulary but every page has at least one word I've never heard used before.) The author builds an extensively described fantasy world, too much of one - more than you want to go into. Between the myths recounted and flowery language there is very little story. The mystery of the history of the main character is revealed slowly . More detail is expounded on the bloody fight with air pirates than moving the story forward.If you like celtic mythology, find a good anthology. If you want a novel with good characterizations, look elsewhere. This book only satisfies a reader that wants to simply float in the world the author built."
1,Snooze Alert,"I was unable to finish this book. I trudged through the first 120 pages,then, which I have never done with a book before, threw it aside and never looked back at it again.I understand it takes time to get a story set-up and rolling, and it looked like it was in the very beginning. It seemed somewhat intriguing, but then it suddenly stopped, and aside from 2 actual incidents of something happening, the rest was a bunch of people telling tales of folklore, which are old stories we have heard before, told just slightly different.I have read Robert Jordan's Wheel Of Time series, and as long winded and sometimes boring as it gets, it had nothing to compare to this.In all fairness, I should have been fore-warned by the title...The Ill-made Mute pretty much tells you the main character has no voice, and though the author uses many words, has no actual voice either."
2,"steer ,if you can, clear","like the title says"" steer clear""....that's the whole problem with this one. the idea of gaming is to have fun and not to spend all of your time trying to figure out how to maintain control especially with controls as twithchy as these seem to be. the guys behind this one need to go back to the board and do some real heavy fine tuning. though the graphics are good this turned out to be a real waste of money."
3,"Great concept, hard to operate","My son loves the Incredibles, so he flipped when he got this for his 4th birthday. He likes to play with it, but the ""quick-change"" is hard to operate. He doesn't seem to mind too much (which is surprising), but unless the vehicle is positioned correctly, it's not much fun. It's a neat idea, but takes a little work to make it worthwhile."
2,"Great Movie, Disappointing Toy","My three year old son's exact words on Christmas morning: ""Daddy, this is not a cool toy."" As mentioned in previous reviews, this toy is difficult to operate. The costumed Mr. Incredible gets hung on the dashboard when the hood is pressed, and it takes several hard shoves to retract the turbo and re-seat the tuxedoed Mr. Incredible. Also, the headlight covers will no doubt soon be lost, as they come off nearly every time they're raised to deploy the missles."
2,Nylon Hair is better than Sculpted Plastic Hair!,"I feel that the nylon hair on the original figures was more lifelike and feel that these newer versions with the plastic/resin sculpted hair is ridiculous, especially the new Legolas figure, he just looks terrible!!!! Why not just buy the 6"" figures, because that's what they look like now - what's so special? I always picked these collectibles 12"" figures up for my son and he was really looking forward to the new figures coming out, only to be very disappointed!"
4,Pretty cool,"The kids play with him for a while with this. Worth the $5.29 plus free shipping, he says some neat things. His head is soft, so when you press the button on his chest, the jaw lowers and the sound comes out, and his mouth stretches."
2,Who's voice is that?,"The toy seems nice, and the hard to press button is easy to ignore, after all he is a cool character.The problem I have is that this is a speaking doll, but the voice is bad. It sounds like a very old man, that does not at all sound like Creg T. Nellson.The screwed up on the voice, and the phrases are only close to the movie phrases. Close, but not close enough."
3,Nokia charger,"I needed a charger for my Nokia phone, and the one specified for my phone was the Nokia ACP-12U. So that was what I ordered, but I received a Nokia AC-2U charger, which has different specs (lower output). Being in the situation I was in, I had nothing to lose by trying it out. It does seem to work normally, but a customer is always going to think twice before doing business again with a company that delivers a different product than the one advertised and purchased."
4,Great addition to MTG,This is where so many of the characters are developed that lead to the other series. Seeing the obsession of Urza as he seeks a way to destroy Phyrexia and his interaction (or lack thereof) with those around him made the story compelling.Great addition to the cycle; I just wish Jeff Grubb or J.Robert King had done the second book in the Cycle.
3,Not worth the trouble,"I'd just like to point out that this product is almost identical to teddy grahams and icing which you can buy in any grocery store. You can find just as much variety and save a bundle by purchasing in this manner rather than paying for packaging. I loved dunkaroos as a kid, but the memories are just as easily brought back for $5 than $35."
1,dunkaroos,"I have been searching everywhere for these dunkaroos, everytime i go in a grocery store and ask for this product people look at me like i am crazy, because they have never heard of this product. but i think $32 for a 14 pack of dunkaroos is ridiculous. don't get me wrong i love dunkaroos but not for $32."
3,Unsure,"I can't give this a fair review, because I haven't finished it. The reason I haven't finished it is because I couldn't get interested from the start. I kept waiting to be told to ""check with mail carriers, school bus drivers, farmers, etc for areas to find deer"", like all the books in the 70's. Hopefully, I can finish the book, but unless it starts getting better, that may not be possible."
2,Disappointing,"Overall, I am very disappointed with this book. I will be teaching a high school creative writing class and I was looking for books that would guide me. The activities are very basic - they would probably work better for elementary and junior high students. The main source of disappointment is the lack of substantial content. The book is only 69 pages (with a lot of blank space on each page). I would have been happy to spend $3-4 on this, but $18 seems like a complete rip off."
1,Poor Quality,Not even in HD. Looks Real bad on any quality TV. Poor production. GAmes cool but very poor quality videos. About 30 seconds of getting the trophy.
2,"Awesome title, dissapointing contents","I have to admit, I bought this book based upon its title alone. After breastfeeding continuously for over seven years, I really wanted to read a good, funny book about a nursing mother. However, I kept feeling that Lisa Shapiro was trying, really hard to be funny, but just kept missing the mark. I was prepared for the fact that the book might not be factually correct ( it isn't ), I was just hoping for funny. If you're looking for funny AND factually correct, I'd really recommend, ""So THAT's What They're For!: Breastfeeding Basics"" by Janet Tamaro"
4,I liked it!,"Good job! This is a practical guide to America's fastest-growing pastime. If you want to read another great tailgating book try ""A Tailgater's Guide To SEC Football"" The Cajun recipes are super!"
2,Only bought for the sun,"I bought a different solar system set for my son for Christmas this year that was outstanding, but it did not come with the sun. I bought this set in order to complete the other set I had bought. The sun in this set doesn't even compare to the brightness of the other set of planets I bought. The quality of this set so very cheap and does not light up bright at all."
4,Solar System that Glows,It was small as other's have commented but it came with a sun. The planets are in proportion as far as I am concerned. The Earth confused my four year old because it was not green and blue but white and blue (supposedly is as it would look from a space shuttle in space). We name them every night and they do glow for a while. I hung with tacs and seem to be okay. The fishing type string was sufficient to hang them albeit annoying to work with.
4,"good, but not perfect","i like how firm it is. the flat surface (not counting the bumps on there which i assume are for baby's head?) is better for holding your arm up than any other BF pillow i've tried. baby doesn't slip down between your belly and the pillow or sink into softness. i don't really walk around when i'm breastfeeding though, so to me the wrap-around feature is just a pain in the butt. it's cumbersome trying to get that thing around you while there's a wailing newborn in your arms. would rather have a version without the back part, it would be easier to put it on your lap and take it off after feedings."
4,Wish I would have got the deluxe,For nursing I prefer this over the Boppy any day. The one design flaw besides this being the ugliest cover you have ever seen is the mesh strap. My VERY active boy baby has a large abrasion on the outside of his right ankle. It was bloody and caloused. We racked our brains for a week tying to figure out what was hurting him until I finally realized that he was playing with the tag on the pillow with his foot while he nursed and rubbing that poor little ankle back and forth over the edge of the mesh strap! The deluxe pillow has fabric covering the strap that would have prevented this.
3,Scratcy Material,"This item seems okay... I also have the Balboa Pillow, in comparison the material on the Brest Friend Pillow is very scratchy & for this reason can't bring myself to use it. Also not good if you've had a c-section or for nursing in the football hold."
4,Perfect for a petite woman!,"I'm a first-time mom and can't compare this item to the Boppy (which I know is it's competition), but I LOVE it! It is completely adjustable, which works great for a small person like me. My only issue is that where the pillow is raised on top to support the baby, no longer works for me because my son is too big (14 lbs). So, I flip the pillow over (using it upside-down) for a flat surface. Other people may still find it comfortable to use the top side longer, it just didn't work for us.I love that I can use it standing up, too! These seem far superior to any other nursing pillows and I highly recommend the Brest Friend."
3,Smells like paint thinner.,"I bought this after using a Boppy for the first several weeks. I wanted to try something else because my daughter would slide between me and the boppy and it was always too low for me to feed without hunching over. My Brest Friend pillow is much better in that regard, as you can adjust the height and it offers a lot better support for baby. However, when I received it I noticed an extremely strong odor of chemicals. I thought it would dissipate after a few minutes, but it really, REALLY smells bad. As one of the other raters mentioned, it has some harmful chemicals in it that are probably really bad for baby to inhale. I plan to wash the cover and set the pillow outside to see if it airs out. What a pain."
3,Not for me...,"I received the My Breast Friend pillow as a shower gift. I intended on using it a lot as many of the mom's I knew swore by it. However, when I had my daughter and started to use it, I found it cumbersome and not very convenient. I ended up using pillows and then eventually nothing. For me, it's one of those things that seemed great, but ended up being unnecessary. Therefore, because of the price, I would recommend borrowing one from a friend if you can especially because if you do end up using it, it will probably only be for a few months."
5,LOVE this pillow!,I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine. I just this breastfeeding pillow with three kids and could not have survived without it. It truly helps position the baby properly and provides comfort for both baby and mom. The Lactation Center at the Hospital recommended it and I'm glad they did! Colors and patterns are cute and tasteful.
2,don't like it,I bought this before my daughter was born and was pretty disappointed right from the start.first of all it's a pain to put around and close it while having to hold a baby.My daughter never layed on it properly and I still had to use 2 extra pillows to put her in a good nursing position.Now my daughter is 3 months and doesn't fit on it anymore.I am not happy with this product and wouldn't buy it again if I had the choice...
1,Book does not do justice to INVENTOR,The main material of this book is a rehash/dryrun and listing of what the Inventor user interface and menus do in each chapter. There is not much content on how to actually use the concepts and techniques of Inventor to do real stuff. The authors have decided to put all that stuff on the CD. They have some kind of a compiled html file that walks you thru the techniques of each chapter with busted exercises. The CD is very poorly made with lots of chapters entirely missing and incomplete exercises in many other chapters. The program constantly crashes. I am surprised that a respected name like Autodesk would put out a book like this. That is my two cents worth.
5,Love these machines,"i have three of these machines in different sizes of course, and they are really great especially with crafts such as card, and invitation making."
1,Close doesn't make it in thermometers,"I've had one of these for five or six years ago. A year or so ago I noticed the the indoor temperature indicated seemed to be lower than it should be and I checked it with another thermometer and, of course, where I had set the thermostat on the air conditioner. It registers a temperature three or four degrees below the actual temp. A thermometer this expensive should be more accurate."
2,wouldnt come out,"this is the only mold i bought that I cant get the candy out of. It could be me I guess but i did what I do with all the other molds I have,"
3,An interesting read but contains serious factual errors,"This book was a fun read, especially for a Boston native, with lots of referances to local places in Boston and Somerville. The hospital is obviously supposed to be McLean, down to the tunnels under the buildings and the history of year long hospitalizations.However, the book's whole premise was based on incorrect information. The plot revolves around a teenagers addiction to Ritalin. The latest studies, published in scientific journals, show that you do not increase your tolerance to Ritalin as you take it. There are also no withdrawel effects from the drug. It is not considered addictive at all, although some people do abuse it by snorting it and get a high with that method. It is concerning to see a book with such incorrect information. These authors did not do enough research before writing, which is too bad, because otherwise it's a fun story."
1,skeet shootin,"this is the worst game EVER.I live in south lake tahoe,number 2 gambeling mecha on the west coast behind vegas, and i've seen WAY better hands on video poker at the casinos. my verdict, take the money you'd spend on the video game and go to a casino. next time I go skeet shootin im takin this game with me. (the only reason i gave it 1 star is because you have to rate it)"
4,Walter Dean Myers at his best,"The Righteous Revenge Of Artemis Bonner was a adnenturous comedy with a lot of susspense. The story is focused on a boy named Artemis Bonner who in search for his deceased uncle's treasure, but only one thing stands in his way, and that is a man named Catfish Grimes who is also looking for the treasure. The race is on.This book is best suited for ages 12 and up."
2,The Righteous Revenge Of Artemis Bonner,"Personally, I think that this book is a bit scary for people who get scared very easily and are under 12. Anyway, I found this book quite interesting, the way it is written. This book takes place in 1880 in a old town around the Alaskan Territory. The things they mention may be frightning - like the was Lucy Feather dip ripping off Artemis's ear with her mouth, while she is hanging upside down. I the story they include some eveidence if how it was bakc then in the 1800's, like having very cheap things like accomodation. the was they speak is also different like: "" Where are you headed?"" Instead of "" Where are you heading?"".You should read this book if you are interested in all the things I have mentioned.Thank you!Celia:)"

3,not so good,I had gastric bypass about 3 weeks ago. Since then I have spent over 100 dollars trying to find a protein shake that works for me. Sorry to say this one doesn't taste great. It's not as bad as the rest of the protein powders I have tasted. I bought the Nectar Cappuccino and it's major sweet and just plain horrible. Then I tried some Walmart stuff and it's no good either. The problem with me is that I guess if I could chug this stuff it would be fine but my surgeon wants me to sip on this stuff for an hour and I just can't do it. The first few sips were like okay I think I can do this and after 30 minutes I wanted to vomit. To me it still has a strong smell of powder and mixed with water it is smooth but still taste like protein powder. I think I will try it as a smoothie next and see if that works. On a good note it does mix well with a shaker bottle and can be bought locally at The Vitamin Shoppe.
2,"At first its like ""hmm refreshing kinda.."" but then its like...","So, for some reason I jumped into the Syntrax Nectar hype for a more flruity flavor, avoiding the more sweet flavors. It was just a 50/50 chance really because I don't mind either flavors when it comes to protein shakes. Considering I require higher amounts of protein, I use at least 2-3 scoops, making the flavor a bit more bold... and more like a ""shake"". Now you are thinking... how does that work with lemon-aid? And you would be right... after a while it becomes kind of nasty to drink. The flavor becomes real fake and half way through this glass I was drinking (extremely clumpy btw, even in lukewarm water) I had to set it down and walk away... because I couldn't stomach it anymore. I am going back to chocolate flavors."
2,Tastes good/ to clumpy,"I really loved the taste of this product however, it is extremely clumpy and does not dissolve. When you try to blend or mix it with anything other than a spoon it foams up horribly... When you mix it with a spoon it does not dissolve enough. I have tried other fruit flavored blends that dissolve better."
3,Not BAD but not GREAT,This is a flavor that might work for some but to me it was middle of the road. It was ok but not the best flavor they have. Then again taste is subjective.
3,"Ok flavor, too clumpy","It has a good flavor, kind of like crystal lite fake lemonade. I would definitely buy it again except that it clumps too much, even using my blender ball bottle...when drinking it, there are little super-tart lemon-flavored clumps...shake all you want, but unless you are using a pro drink mixer, you won't be able to get the clumps out. It's not entirely unpleasant though, so if you really like lemon, go for it."
2,Very medicinal,"It's not undrinkable, but it has a very harsh, medicinal taste. And to paraphrase Cabin Pressure, if it was ever even shown a picture of a lemon it wasn't looking. Your tastebuds do adjust eventually, so if you really can't stand the usual milkshake model, this might be an alternative worth trying, but you should definitely find a sample pack before buying a large package."
1,"Is it just me, or is New Riders writing their own reviews?","I've noticed that New Riders seems to have 4 to 5 times as many reviews (glowing, grammatically correct) as other publisher titles on Photoshop. Makes me think they're stacking the deck."
1,A Lazy Sloppy Writer,"You know the writer who doesn't bother checking the correct path, the correct titles of the choices, leaves out steps? You know the ""author"" who is blatantlyly inflating the number of words in the book with the same nerdy jokes repeated thousands of times? It seems the ""author"" is ""new"" to dynamic procedures and can't tell the steps he outlines are slipshod (and didn't bother following his steps to see if they're correct). Maybe he ran out of time and rushed the last part on Dynamic, Database-Driven Websites. And, of course, the editor also didn't actually check if any steps are missing in the explanations, etc. So everybody saved time and money at the customer's expense. Now that you are forewarned don't be a customer."
4,"Good product, picture deceptive",these are good shocks that met all expectations. however they did not come with the fill hose line and valve. even though the the picture showed it. when i called the contact was no help other than offering to allow me to return items and he would reship another set. time did not allow for me to fool around with this so i had to buy the kit locally which cost another $14.
5,Great CD,"Wow, what a CD? GAME, Kanye, Cam'ron, Juelz Santana really did it big on this CD. A must have to say the least. Great production as well. Its been a long 6 years but worth the wait. Thanks DJ Clue, thanks."
1,Ugh,What an insult to science....How could this have even been published? At least it admits its just creationist nonsense...
2,Not to be touched with a barge pole.,"Sound from this unit is fair...nothing to call home about. In the Washington, DC where the station frequencies are quite crowded, tuning in to my favorite stations is impossible. My boss has an older Philips unit that tunes in with no problem. The units are separated by about 20 feet and are both sitting in windows on the same same side of the building. If you intend to use the radio, forget this unit."
1,I couldn't finish it!,"No character development, unoriginal plot, no chemistry between anybody. I'm glad I didn't buy this one."
3,Liked It Better Than I Thought,"After reading other reviews, I expected to be disappointed with this book after really enjoying Under the Boardwalk. I'm not going to write a plot summary but it does continue the family sagas of the Costas family started in Under the Boarwalk. I just enjoyed that this is a quick read. No it's not Carly Phillips' best book, but it still is enjoyable. I already loved a lot of the characters and feel this is why a lot of other reviewers didn't like it because it builds on what was already established. I didn't feel a great connection with the male lead and his family and maybe wasn't supposed to but the rest of the characters do connect. I thought the attempt a mystery half way through the book kept it from becoming a really good book. It's almost like it was an after thought in Phillips' mind and she didn't fully develop it. However I do recommend this book. I think it's a good beach book or a book for someone looking for a quick light-hearted read."
1,NOT brushed chrome,"The title for this product says ""Brushed Chrome"" but it's actually made of gray plastic! I unfortunately didn't read the reviews until after I bought it and several of them talk about the motor going bad and other mechanical problems, but I returned it before I ever used it. This looked to me like and sounds like a terrible product!"
4,Good for how I use it.,A friend of mine introduced me to this blender and I really enjoyed it. I do not make many smoothies but this blender does make great daiquiries and milk shakes.
2,Use Lonely Planet Instead,"I read this book and then traveled to Prague with the information I thought I had absorbed. Frommer's Prague is incredibly innaccurate and is full of errors. To name a few, the times it lists for castles is incorrect as well as the location of several tourist spots. The guide assumes the train drops one off at the site, when it can lead one several towns astray from the actual location. Furthermore, in terms of times to destinations that guide makes it seem that only a few hours are necessary when one could spend an entire day getting to only one spot. This especially is true for Karstejn Castle and Krivoklat. Please make sure to print maps off the computer before you depend on this book (the book also lacks a great number of necessary maps for tourist spots). Prague and the Czech Republic are not difficult to navigate, but without a good guidebook with maps and relevant information, days and hours are wasted wandering, which leads to ruined adventures."
2,Nothing special,Good book for starting into spreads. They tend to just give a small sample of seasonal spreads in the book and by this year(2007) the tables will be outdated. More of a basic intro book that tries to sell their(MRCI) data service where they show many more seasonal spread trades to look at.
4,Just keeps getting better...,"The man can play jazz. It may just be a coincidence, but after seeing Roy Hargrove in concert with Herbie Hancock last year, this CD sounds better than any of Hargrove's previous albums, all of which are good.Fast or slow, hard or easy the music just sounds terrific."
3,Good,"I'm a man of few words so I'll put it this way, this cd is good but not great. None of the tracks reach out and grab you. Though it's better than okay."
2,Few songs that make you feel valor,"I was really disappointed with the selections on this CD. The quality of the recording was great - it was band music that sounded like it was played in a concert hall. But the choice of songs was questionable. What do ""selections from South Pacific"" have to do with ""uncommon valor"" or the Marines? ""Eternal Father Strong to Save"" was sullen where it should have evoked more emotion. The first track, the armed forces medley, was upbeat, but I would have preferred if I heard each song in its entirety on its own. The last track (the Marine Corps Hymn) should be the best, the loudest, the strongest, the most ebullient. Instead, it was somber and slow and a ""different"" interpretation of a rousing song that seemed to be done just for the sake of being different. I would not purchase this CD again given the chance, nor would I recommend it to others."
1,Do not buy,"This model has a chronic problem where it resets to 12:00:00 1/1/2000 repeatedly. This seems to happen with every single watch. I've had mine replaced by Casio, now the replacement watch is resetting every day but I am now 1 month out of warranty so I'm stuck with it.Do not buy. :("
1,"Very, very disappointed...","If there was a no star rating, this massager would get it! I purchased this foot massager last year, after seeing it on Oprah Show. Picked by a guest actress, as a must have in her 9th month of pregnacy. Oh, so NOT what I hoped for. 1st, opening box to find NO moving message function was a negative. 2nd, in turning it on... was just a HIGH powered vibrating box. Had my mother-in-law use it for just afew minutes, thinking it would help with nerve/circulation problems(Dr had recommended a messager for this)and she had hard time walking the next day! She has since gotten a moving base model with better speed modes and has worked well for her. And 3rd, the high cost is a big waste... just go out and get a $20 massager for the same quality as this one."
3,Great Item-but loud,"I love the concept of this item; however, it is loud and distracting. I actually returned it. We were looking for something to use while we were watching TV and we were unable to hear the TV over the massager. We have since purchased a different quieter model and are VERY happy with it. Well designed with features, but loud."
1,Sad but interesting for history's sake,"A great example of how the hype and speculation of the late 1990's led to the bursting of the internet bubble. The book typifies the kind of thinking that got everyone into trouble: No real understanding of how technology works: No viable business model for profit; Hysterical optimism and conclusions without solid critical thinking. Anyone who had half a clue back then would have read this book and said ""This is exactly what is wrong with digital entertainment today"". Anyone who still believes what this book has to say is crying over his useless e-toys stock right now. Read it only if you want to better understand why things turned sour."
1,"Dangerous element, dangerous information","The heating element was shorted to the bracket, literally inside the element. Casual observation looked like the material that holds and insulated the conductor broke down allowing contact with the edge/bracket. When I spoke with Charbroil they asked if I used an extension cord, in a couple of cases I used my good heavy duty 14 gauge cord.The rep assured me that that was the problem, I must use a 16awg cord, which is smaller (worse) then what I used. She also assured me that they wouldn't cover the unit if a better cord was used, because it gets ""power"". I then asked if I could plug it straight in to the outlet to which they replied ""yes"". I tried to relate that a better cord is more like plugging directly in to the outlet, ""on no, it needs to be a 16guage orange extension cord.""Guess I will shop for a new unit rather than fix one that requires the use of an extension cord as a voltage dropping device."
3,Keyword - TRANSLUCENT!,"Translucent would hae been a very useful word to include in the description. At first glance, this looked like a nice dark red case. It does fit well, however it went on a White GS3 so it looks PINK... Not quite what I envisioned."
4,OK cover for the price,"This cover fits well, doesn't add bulk, and feels secure in your hand.The buttons could be easier to find, and you have to press harder than I care for.Some aftermarket USB cables may not fit or require being cut back to fit opening for charging."
5,beautiful blue,"this is a nice true blue, and i absolutely love blue. it provides more protection than my aduro hardhsell case."
3,Textured grip the best but form fitting leaves a little to be desired,"Good for the price if you can get it for under $5 but some key issues remain.Pros:- Textured along the sides under the power and volume rockers allows for easier grip and less worry of slipping out of your hands- Nice color and the ""stylish"" pattern on the back makes the case less boring looking- Is not too heavy but has enough weight to make it feel like it will actually protect your gs3Cons:- The volume and power rockers are completely covered and not as responsive. Takes a bit to get used to the extra forced needed to get them to respond- Takes a little time to ""break in"" the case, starts off very stiff but gets a little more comfortable after a week of solid use- The worst part is the USB connection. Once in the case, only UBS cords with a very thin/small bezel will fit. The stock GS3 charger will not fit without forcibly adjusting / breaking / cutting the case on the bottom."
3,"It seems like a good surge protector, but","I wanted a 20 amp and this is only 15. Nowhere did it say that on the web site. I searched for 20 amp surge protectors and this one was near the top of the list. I have been using it anyhow for my microwave with no problems, but it should have said it was only 15 amps."
4,One persons thought,"Pros: Nice screen, nice hardware configuration ie...CPU, RAM, HD etc....stylish look, light weight, DVD Burner, keybooardCons: These are more of what I would like to see in a laptop so its just not this one specific...no video out connection for TV, no infrared or bluetooth, integrated video, priceOverall this is a nice laptop. There are other brands that would carry more features for the price but I generally find myself supporting SONY for there products. Unless you are a SONY fan like me you could save some money and purchase a different brand."
2,Short Life,"When we first purchased the vacuum it was great. Heavy, but the suction powewr was great. We have three cats and one dog so we needed a vacuum that had the kind of power offered by the wind tunnel. Unfortunatly the vacuum only lasted one month longer than our warranty. We are told the repair costs are very high and not worth the fixing. Our repair man stated that the vaccumm has a very poor design and would be back in his shop within one year, he futher stated ""save your money and get a different vaccum""."
2,happy until today,"I purchased the original self-propelled Wind Tunnel about 2 years ago. I must say that I was thrilled with the power and ease of operation. I have cats and this vacuum cleaner was great at picking up cat hair. However, today, the motor burned up. At this price, I certainly expected it to last much, much longer than 2 years. (And I must say that I am NOT a frequent vacuumer!!) I took it to a repair shop and the man pointed to 4 (out of 10 or 12) Wind Tunnels waiting for repair or pick-up...I haven't decided yet whether to repair or put it down to a bad decision and buy something else. But I am very disappointed in my Hoover experience."
2,Disappointed with ease of use and durability,"I've only had my WindTunnel for 3 months. We purchased it based on the high ratings it has received. Unfortunately, we've found that the tools are very difficult to use due to the short, stiff hose. It takes two hands to manage the hose/tools and prevent them from pulling apart. In the meantime, the vacuum tips over very easily as you try to manage the hose/tools. The very first time it tipped over the release lever broke. We now have to bring it in to be repaired. Who knows how many more times this will happen or what will break next. I'm very disappointed with the ease of use and durability of this product considering the price Hoover charges for it."
3,"Too Heavy, self propel cable broke after 6 months","Overall, it works well, but has a few problems. It is quite heavy which makes it a pain to carry up and down stairs. The cable that controls the self propell switch broke, which makes it a real pain to use as it is too heavy to push around manually. Also, the self propel is only in the forward direction. So, are you supposed to vacuum like you mow your lawn? Make a pass, turn around and make another? I myself use a back and forth motion which means it is only self propelled half the time."
1,Disposable Vacumn,"This machine is a piece of junk. Mine died about 13 months after purchase. The machine is OK if you are built like Charles Atlas and are hard of hearing, and rich, so you can buy a new one every year.The drive wheels scratch vinyl tile.The mechanism which turns the carpet beaters on and off is very difficult to operate and finally broke, leaving me with a very heavy, noisy, bare floor vacumn.Despite the price, I recommend buying an Electrolux upright instead. We have a 15 year old one that works as good as new.Avoid this model of Hoover."
1,Do not Buy.,"Don't even consider. Piece of junk. If you like doing twice the work, buy it. If you don't want to clean up behind it, look for another. This is even less then 1 star in my opinion."
2,Only lasts a short time,"I had to buy one of these about every 5-6 months. If it is exposed to the sun, the plastic cover gets ""crispy"" on top, splits open, disintegrates and then is no good at all. A canvas tarp would work better. Not worth it unless you like buying a new one in 6 months."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this thinking it would be nice to cover the grill and 15 bucks isnt a bad deal..or wasnt supposed to be. I live in a condo and the wind is pretty bad. The first night, I noticed the cover almost flew off so I secured it down with some bricks. The second night, even with the bricks, the thing flew away and havent seen it since.You would think since PatioCaddie desinged this cover for its own grill it would be better manufactured.Also, asthetically, it looked like an ugly garbage bag over the grill.Dont waste your money or time."
3,Grill Cover,It caught on something and tore the first time I used it. It should have been a slightly hardier material.
2,Patio Caddie Cover,"This cover will not last if it's exposed to the elements (sun, rain and wind). This cover only lasted me about one year."
4,Nice Cover,This is a nice cover for the Char-Broil Patio Caddie Grill. It's basic black in color and easily slips over the entire grill.
1,Junk,I bought the cover in December and by Feburary it is falling apart. I live in the south and it is under a roof so the weather is not the problem.Amazon will not replace it because it is over 30 days and Char-Broil will not replace it because it was bought on Amazon.My neighbor has the same grill and he buys one at Wall Mart which will work for 4.98.I suggest a purchase somewhere else would be the best solution since a replacement is not an option.
1,Utterly and completely worthless,"This series of disks is nothing more than Italian words and names spoken ONLY IN ITALIAN. Because there are no English translations, it is almost impossible to learn even the most basic Italian from these disks."
5,Exceeded My Expectations,"If there were an organization for the ethical treatment of vacuum cleaners, my household would be on their hit list. This vacuum thoroughly cleans up after desert dust, lots of pets, and a very active household. The most unexpected bonus is that it compacts the collected dust & debris so I don't have to empty the bin nearly as often as I did with Hoover's leading competitor."
1,"Horrid, Horrid Machine!","I have never written a review, but if this makes just one person pause before they purchase this machine, it was worth the effort.This is the most miserable product I have ever had the misfortune of purchasing. I have had mine for a little over a year, and have had the following problems: broken belts (multiple, I have actually lost count), unit emits burning smell when used, self-propel belt keeps slipping off and disabling the feature (requiring dimantling of machine to repair), dust cup is a nightmare to empty (I mean really, really awful and messy) and fills much too quickly, unit tips over when left alone, and the machine is unusually loud and is getting louder each time I use it.I will never buy a Hoover product again! This was not worth any amount of money. If I could give it less than one star, I would."
1,Hoover 6630 - Constant belt problems,"When this machine works, it's terrific - great suction. However, after normal use for less than a year, the main belt melted and broke. No problem, bought a genuine Hoover replacement. Ever since, the machine runs about 5 to 10 minutes before the belt slips off and it no longer sucks anything. Must remove 4 screws on the bottom, remove the bottom plate, put the belt back on, re-attach the screws, and it's good to go - for another 5 to 10 minutes. For any machine - but especially one this expensive - this is unacceptable. Don't waste your money on a Hoover like this one."
4,works great,"I have only had this vacuum for 2 1/2 months, but so far it works great. I have 3 kids, a cat, and a very large long haired dog."
2,Worked great at first,"It picked up great but one month before the warranty expired the thing made terrible noises and didn't self-propel correctly. Sent it in for repair, took a month. They said ""nothing"" was wrong and sent it back, but now it works. I wouldn't buy another one. For $300 it should last more than a year before repairs are needed.Spend your money on something built better.http://www.candle-licious.comSue"
1,Probably the worst vacuum cleaner ever,"I ordered this vacuum and received it about a month ago. I have used the vacuum cleaner maybe 12 -15 times or so, as I vacuum every few days and it has already malfunctioned in two ways. The self-propel mechanism has already started failing intermittently and the switch that is used to turn the brush off has broken off. Broken off is not exactly the correct phrase, as the plastic didn't break, the switch just came apart and fell into the body of the vacuum. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this vacuum.On the positive side, it does have a really good hand tool."
1,Piece of Junk!,"This is the WORST vacumm cleaner I have ever had! It has continually broken down since I bought it and is now again dead. It's only 1 1/2 years old! While under warranty (the first year), I went through 5 belts, a roller brush, and the motor burned out. It is no longer under warranty, and of course, it broke down again. It smokes like it's on fire, and I believe that it's the roller brush *again*. Now mind you, my house is only 1600 sq ft, and half of that space is wood flooring, so I don't have an excessive amount of carpet. Nor do I vacuum excessively. Maybe once a week. I complained to Hoover and they basically told me ""too bad"". And it's not like it's an inexpensive vacuum at $289!I will never again buy a Hoover product!"
1,Don't buy this piece of junk.,"I bought this vacuum new and used it three times. For those three times, it worked like a dream. Wow. Never had the carpet been so clean. It looked like a professional carpet cleaner had just visited.On the fourth use, the brush abruptly stopped rolling and the motor started smoking. This was regular, everyday carpet with light dirt--not on individual rugs with fringe or other items that typically damage a vacuum. It cost me $100 to repair. After that it required two more spendy repairs and I finally stopped using it.The depressing thing was that the repair shop owners (I went to two places) both had a good laugh when I brought it in. He said they see so many of these models with broken belts and motors that it keeps them in business.Ignore what Consumer Reports says about this model--it's not worth the money."
1,Disappointing,"I was looking for more specific tips on working a room. There was not anything like that, just very generaland very obvious Do's and don'ts."
1,Boring,"I love Gene Clark. White Light was a really cool Album. I loved Gene with the Byrds. I thought I would give this one a go, but it is a no go for me. The guys should have stuck with Andy and Barney as far as I can tell. Clark's contributions seem out of place and it just isn't the format for him to excel in. I know that this was kind of ahead of it's time and all that but I just can't see it past the soggy bottom boyish stuff that it is. I love some bluegrass/country like Allison Kraus etc. but this is mediocre stuff at anytime, and Clarke did nothing to help."
4,Good for sore muscles and relaxation.,Got this for sore back and shoulder muscles. Works great. Cordless is a must. Powerful so the low setting is preferred. Fairly quiet.
1,Acuvibe,"After using this product twice, the spring broke making it unusable.I would not purchase again."
5,"Best damn book on Robert Johnson or any bluesman, ever.",Robert Johnson was my friend. And I feel thatAlan Greenberg sets the record straight aboutall the lies and crap about Robert's life.
1,"Good ""script""",A good script based on Robert Johnson. If you like movie scripts this one is very readable.
3,o.k. high lights,Could have and should have been better.Not enough Nolan Ryan.Worth if bought for under $15.They should have had more interviews with past player stars.
4,Great Buy!!,"I love this printer so much at work, I purchased one just like it for my home. It is a fast and dependable printer. Wish I would have purchased it two years ago instead of the Kodak I wasted $100.00 on."
2,box TOO small,"i HAVE HAD THIS AWHILE MY FIRST KITTY USING IT WAS A VERY LIGHT BODY WEIGHT BOX SIZE OK .NOW i HAVE BIG BOY (15 LBS ) THE BOX SIZE IT SELF IS TO SMALL I,M ALWAYS SCOOPING MY SELF."
2,"Love the idea, hate the hassle","Ok, I'll admit that it is great not having to worry about scooping, and once I empty the tray, the house no longer smells like cat poop, BUT:The thing jams constantly. When ever I hear it raking, i know i'm going to have to get up to shake the litter so the rake can return to its resting position. If not it will cycle constantly. This usually happens at night, or an hour before I have to wake up.Clumps stick to the bottom. I use Tidy Cats, and it still clumps. Actually, the best brand was the walmart generic. It only clumps once a week.If you have more than one cat get the larger size, otherwise you'll be sorry. Very sorry."
2,DOESN'T DO IT'S JOB,"I AM NOT SATISFIED WITHTHE PRODUCT. THE LITTER BOX DOES NOT CLEAN COMPLETELY, IT SCRAPS THE TOP OF THE LITTER BUT NOT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX. WHEN I RECEIVED THE PRODUCT I DID NOT RECEIVE THE ADAPTER FOR THE BOX. I E-MAILED BACK WITH NO RESPONSE. I HAVE HAD OTHER LITTER BOXES WHICH HAVE PERFORMED MUCH BETTER."
3,The name says it all. With this product you just became the maid.,"I hate to be negative when I review products but on this item I would be remiss if I didn't tell you all the truth about the product. Don't waste your money. You will still end up cleaning the cat box and resetting it every time there is a problem and the box malfunctions. You must buy special litter, (their brand) because if you don't it works even worse. You will also now have to buy odor charcoal pads and plastic poop trays periodically, (their brand) so once you invest in this product they have you over the cat box. There products are not cheap to purchase and they don't even give you any free coupons to excite you about it. The motor is way under powered and will cause the unit to reset when it gets stuck sweeping into the dump tray."
3,"Well, its ok","Take into account everything that has been written on this sucker because it is all true. It is only moderately better than raking through the litter manually. It absolutely requires daily attention if you have multiple cats. I have to go, the litter box has been cycling the whole time I have been writing this review..lol."
1,not worth the money,"i have 1 cat and i have gone throught 3 automatic litter maid boxes in the last 3.8 years, i called the company and they did nothing cause there's only 1 year warrinty, i belive the motors burned up cause the litter would get stuck, i followed all directions & kept the litter below the red line & used premium litter, i feel the litter maid is over priced for the amount of use you get out of it, so i'm on the hunt for a new litter box, trust me it will NOT be another litter maid."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I have owned three of these things. None of them worked. The first one died after three months. The second one worked for six months and died; after waiting several months for their warranty people to get back to me, they finally replaced it. The third one never worked. I tried several times to get a hold of their warranty department, but they never responded to me. I finally threw it away."
1,"Waste of money, Trash......","We bought this item thinking it would be easy.In 1 year we went through 5 of them.Large clumps burned out the motor 2 times.The power supply failed twice.Finally the rack would go to the front and stop, the switches that controlled the motor failed.This item was a waste of money and was broken more than it was used.Save your money and buy a regular cat box."
1,Broken before cat ever used it!,"Ordered two even after very mixed reviews. Should of known! Set them both up as directed with premium litter. Tested both. One had a rake that would not stop cycling and the other one didn't cycle at all. I returned both before the cat even used them. Although a hassle, Amazon made the return simple and credited me immediately. I would not recommend."
1,Littermaid needs a maid,"This product is huge, especially with the (overpriced) tent you have to buy because it's so messy the tent is the only way to keep some of the litter contained, and takes up so much space. It's loud, the rake gets clogged, and if you fill beyond the fill line (which you can't see when you have the tent) it will not perform. It is also very sloppy and spills litter all throughout the machine and underneath. The receptacle is difficult to remove. It still smells, you still need to manually scoop, you have to buy more expensive litter and receptacle refills, it's hard to clean.....I'm sticking to my old fashioned litter box, scoop, cheap litter and liners."
2,Good for 90 days....,"Before writing a review on anything you should always own it for at least 90 days. Like other people have said below, it works great when it's new and clean. After about a month, it starts sticking. Continuously running back and forth without stopping. They usually last 6 months before real problems occur. I travel a lot and this was really needed. I'm on my 3rd cause I thought I'd be smart, so I set up a timer so that it wouldn't auto clean so often, but eventually, it breaks down. Don't try the newer models either. They are worst than the old models. Too bad. Conceptually it's great."
5,Excellent time saver...,"The LitterMaid series of products is an excellent time saver, especially if you have multiple cats. Cleaning it is a little difficult, and so is removing the waste receptacle, but overall this a great product. This is my second one!"
3,LitterMaid Disappointment,"We have had an identical product for years, but with 3 cats decided we needed another. Within 5 days of receipt, the newer one malfunctioned and was returned for replacement. The replacement appears to be working OK, although it seems to wait a long time to cycle."
1,Extremely Disappointed!,"I bought this because I was pregnant and not supposed to scoop litter. Unfortunately, the rake in this item was constantly getting stuck. After having it for two months, it completely broke.Don't waste your money."
5,"Love the Product, but...","This is a lifesaver! Went on vacation and did not feel that the housesitter needed to change the litter box. This made it easy for them to do just that with little to no work at all. The house smelled fresh and clean upon our arrival.BUTItem's sensor to tell it to STOP did not work. All sorts of fiddling did not work. Need to manually run the arm and turn it off. Little inconvenient seeming as this is a convenience product. Not fault of the seller, but might be the lack of correct shipping materials or just faulty product. On the other hand, it gives my handy husband something to do!"
2,Incredibly Annoying,"This is the most annoying machine. If you overfill, even a tiny bit, the rake will go back and forth until you want to throw it out the window. If you put too little litter, then the bottom is filled with urine and sticks to the rake. They really need to fix this problem. They need to make it so that you can put enough litter in to actually fill the box and keep urine off the bottom and for the rake to not be so incredibly sensitive. Until they come up with a better one, for us this is just going to be an overpriced litter box."
3,OD - But Kind of Wimpy,"Good Points:InexpensiveSmall footprintFairly easy to clean.Bad Points:The ""high power"" speed button stopped working. This after only making 4-5 smoothies.But I've had it for 2 years now, and the low-power setting still works.Bottom Line: may be better to pay a little more for a larger model.Go to Walmart and buy one there."
4,"Great chopper, the bowl had cracked","The chopper is great, sometimes I even use it for chopping carrots. However, soon after I have started using it, the bowl had cracked at the bottom. It does not bother me yet, so I continue using the chopper. Hope it will not bother me in the future, and the crack will not develop to a failure."
5,Love it,"I really enjoy using this item. It's easy to use, chops or minces and is easy to clean up. Comes with a storage lid and that's a plus too. Doesn't sound like a chainsaw in the kitchen. Nice and quiet."
3,sharp,"the chopper is sharp and fast. the clean up for the blade and the bowl is quite easy, however the top part needs to be wipped frequently, or it will be a hassel to clean. the razor is very sharp, TOO SHARP. be extra careful when handeling do not put the chopper anywhere a kid can reach. if you do not want whatever you're chopping to be minced then you need to use pulses, and after each pulse you have to open and stir, for sometimes the bigger parts of the chopped stuff will either stick to the side (which the blade cannot reach, or slip under. I just give two pulses, then remove the big pieces empty the bowl and repeat with the bigger pieces sometimes, I just through the biggger pieces out if Im not in the mood.hope this helped."
2,Top heavy...,"I purchased this based on all the rave reviews. However, when I received it, I didn't realize how heavy the top was- a bit inconvenient to unload the top each time. This was for my mom who has a weaker arm so wouldn't recommend it for an older person. I returned it."
1,don't buy,"I have absolutely no complaints about performance.It chops and purees most things.I also like the way it handles. It is very comfortable and simple to use.Why the low rating?quite frankly, it is a complete nightmare to clean.Tiny bits of food will get stuck in the plastic holding the blade.Food will also get stuck in little crevices in the top part (which you cannot submerge in water).I just let the blade soak. I also picked out all the particles with a toothpick. Then I would wash it in hot water and soap. I would let the unit dry completely before putting it back together and storing it in my cupboard.But that didn't stop the black mold from growing!!!This is such a shame because I really liked using this product."
5,Really works great,This one is working much better than the other ones much more expensive.You can buy this chopper.
5,Makes chopping so easy I want to cook again - its amazing,"This is a great food chopper/food processor. I used to laboriously grate potatoes on a hand grader for potato pancakes. Now in less than two minutes I have ultra fine potatoes for batter. I used to have an electric food chopper than pureed the food, I didn't mind that so much yet with the B & D food chopper I now have tiny pieces of chopped celery and onion for spaghetti sauce. This little appliances cleans easily and is very study. There is even a removable plastic cover on the bottom that helps the appliance stay on the countertop without slipping. I have noticed that the motor never seems to get warm which should help its longevity. Another great B & D appliance is the chrome retro toaster that looks and toasts like a toaster from yesteryear and actually toasts on BOTH sides of the bread. You can't seem to go wrong with Black and Decker."
5,great gifts or keep for yourself,I originally purchased 3 of these when free shipping was offered...I bought one for myself and 2 as gifts...after using this ...I am keeping another one for myself in case mine breaks...this is great...easy clean up...the blade comes right out...you can chop an onion in fours and pop it in and chops them perfectly...its so easy...I wouldnt want to be without it
3,"As much you cut food to small pieces, it works well.","Got it for $20, including shipping. Honestly for the price it is good.This is not a hundred dollar or more chopper. You need to cut food (fruit, veggies, etc) to small pieces to get good result. If you wonder then what is role of this chopper if you are gonna cut, I would say it make food juicy. For example you maybe able to cut down veggies to pieces for salsa but you cannot push the juice out of them. That is what chopper does. Fill it in small quantities otherwise top portion will remain untouched.But anyway for the price of 4 salsas in grocery, I got this salsa maker and I am happy!"
2,uneven results,"This does a pretty good job on onions, although you have to chop them pretty small if you dont want some large pieces left. On other vegetables you will have a mixture of large and tiny pieces unless you chop them all into a mush of very tiny pieces. I am keeping it to use on onions but for other vegetables I'm am going back to hand chopping. Ive used it on onions, bell peppers, eggplant and mushrooms. It does clean up easily."
1,chopper,"I had wanted this for a long time and when I got it I was very disappointed. it chops great. but the top does not go in the water. so I never feel that I have cleaned it. I use a damp paper towel to wipe the top after using, but I am concerned that some food will remain and I will be putting rotten food back in what I make the next time I use it........."
2,Inadequate processing/pureeing/chopping,"Very disappointed with B&D mini food chopper/processer. It does NOT do a good, or even adequate, job at chopping/processing small quantities. I believe the problem lies in the design/placing of the blades; odd size pieces are always left behind. When I try to puree veggies/herbs (with sufficient liquid to get a paste/puree), there is always ~1/4 to 1/3 that does not get incorporated. Same issue with ""chopping"" (quick pulses), small-to-large pieces left behind; also, I have to open and mix contents to get it to incorporate/chop. Never have this issue when using full-sized Cuisenart food processor (same techniques); the B&D chopper just lacks a good blade placement/design for processing."
1,You get what you pay for.,"Don't bother trying to save money on this food processor. I used it twice, and as I was trying to make an avocado pasta sauce, it just stopped working. There was nothing in the cup that the blades couldn't process, it just seemed like the motor completely gave out. After two uses. Sad, really. Next time, I'll invest the money into a GOOD food processor that won't just die on me."
4,Girlfriend lives it,"Got it for my Girlfriend. She loves it. There is another one, same brand, for just a little bit more, that is larger with 2 blades. I forgot where I saw it. I wanted the bigger one, she wanted the smaller one. Its a little awkward to clean the motor part, which does get food on it, but we haven't had any problems yet. She like it, and thats what matters."
2,"Works ok, but fussy to clean, died too soon.","It works ok, but was a disappoinment overall.I got this because I hoped for something more handy and easier to clean than my big food processor, especially for small jobs. Unfortunately, the top which containes the motor is not washable. So you have to sort of wipe it with a damp cloth or sponge and take a q-tip to the edges to get the gunk out. Which makes it more trouble to use than the big machine where all the dirty parts can be washed.Also, after a year or so of light use, it stopped working, which was something of a relief. Since it was quite cheap, I did not regret trying it, but I was not sorry to see it go."
4,Great little chopper,"This chopper is very good for the price and has a lot of power. I keep it out on my counter and use it for chopping veggies, mixing tuna salad and even mixing salad dressings and whipping eggs for scrambled eggs. Very easy to clean (top rack dishwasher) and doesn't take up much space.Highly recommend this chopper."
5,"Small, But Sweet","I have been looking for a food chopper that is small, powerful and easy to use. This chopper fits the bill perfectly. It is great for those small chopping jobs that you want to get done quickly and easily (and it takes up very little space on the kitchen counter). While I haven't used it extensively yet, the onions, carrots and green peppers I've chopped with it have come out great. The palm of my hand fits nicely and securely on the top of the power unit and allows me to easily access and press the two power buttons. Cleaning is fast and easy. It appears that this chopper will hold up well over time."
4,Nice for hummus,I bought this for making hummus and other bean dips. It's powerful enough and doesn't overheat with some extended mixing to get the perfect texture. A little messy to clean out like any blender. The plastic container seems a bit lightweight but hasn't cracked after almost a year of intermittent use. I'd say it's a good little unit for the price.
2,I have another very good review about it,"I have another review about this item in which I gave it 4 or 5 stars; I wanted to update but didn't know how.Anyways, I loved loved loved this item. I used it to chop onions (my biggest fear) and used it to make tabbouleh, hummus, and baba ghannoush. I literally used it every single day and loved it so much.I am giving it 2 stars now cause it stopped working after one year. So, I'm returning the item and will write to the company to inform them.I'm really disappointed."
2,Short life,"I used to like very much that small mixer. It worked perfectly for my needs - and I've always respected its size. I'd never use it with really hard food or place large amounts of anything in there. It lasted 13 months (in fact, 8 months, because I was abroad for 5 of the 13 months) perfectly and then it suddenly stopped working. Since It worked well, it got 2 stars instead of one."
3,"Okay, could be better","The product itself worked well, however, I was expecting it to be larger than what it was. I would say to spend a little more and get a larger chopper. This one fills up way too easily."
2,"Good, if you aren't expecting much","I bought this because of the great reviews. It is underpowered. I should have known. It burned out after about 10 uses. Plus the buttons are a little stiff and you have to hold them down to operate. After a few minutes, it gets tiresome. If you are using this for little herb chopping, it may work, but nothing serious like guacamole or hummus."
1,"""kaput"" after only a few uses!!","As soon as we used this appliance it bothered us that some processed food that stuck to the lid could not be cleaned out properly. Why didn't they design it with a flexible liner that would permit activation and at the same time would not expose parts that cannot be washed even by hand. Well, we didn't need to worry for too long about hygiene since the darn thing stopped working altogether after only a few uses. For $20+ it's not worth returning it either. CAVEAT!"
1,Don't risk it - broken when received. Absolute garbage.,"This product was broken from the start. The blades would churn a little, but as soon as you put food in the processor, it would jam up. The motor is so weak, it can't even chop onions, let alone something with tougher skin like peppers. I was once a loyal Amazon customer, but I will never again buy this kind of product from Amazon because the ""Return Window"" had passed before the recipient was even able to try it out! It doesn't work and now I'm stuck with this hunk of plastic. In the trash it goes!"
5,A MUST HAVE!,"This little sucker does a GREAT job! I got me one and absolutely LOVED it. So, for Christmas, I got my parents and father-in-law one. Haven't heard their response, yet. I have a big Cuisinart and don't use it like I should because it's so inconvenient dragging it out and putting it back up. The Black and Decker is SO light and easy to use, it's amazing. I keep it on my cabinet shelf, along with my spices, sugar, and flour, because it's so small and fits there perfectly. It also cleans up easily. Even through the holidays, I didn't have to drag out that big ole Cuisinart. I highly recommend this product!"
3,It's an OK Chopper,I bought this item to chip tomatoes and onions for my pico de gallo but it ends up liquifying the tomatoes. It chops everything else up ok and it's easy to clean.
5,Love it!,"It's so easy to use and clean and doesn't take up a lot of counter space. I use it to chop up vegetables for my dogs. The container is just the right size for servings for them. And if I have too much for that meal, I just take the plastic bottom, cover the container and put it in the fridge for the next day."
5,Simple and cheap smoothie maker,"I use this every morning to make a delicious frozen fruit smoothie. Chopped ice, water, frozen mango and berries, scoop of vanilla whey protein powder and a splash of flax seed oil. Delicious, easy and nutritious! Then I rinse it out and it's ready for tomorrow. Sure beats the Bullet at $50!"
3,Plastic Bowl Doesn't Last,"This is a nice chopper with large storage bowl and lid and takes up little counter space. HOWEVER, after a few months the center bottom of the plastic bowl that holds the blade began to crack and eventually broke away. I contacted Black & Decker (now Applica) for a replacement. The cost to replace the bowl was $16.19. I can get a whole new chopper for that price. No complimentary replacement offered for me. :( I think I will look to purchase another brand to avoid having another plastic bowl break and render an otherwise great chopper unusable."
4,Shake God.,"This was very good reading. Without trying to parse it one way or another-that would take a more intelligent mind-I'll simply state that it captivated, kept me curious and took me on the ride.Essentially a monologue, Desolation is like the last gasp of a man compelled to express himself as he turns into the void. He talks to his son, wife, friends, lovers in a confessional and passionate tone.Yasmina Reza is a remarkable writer. I particularly appreciate her ability to unify brutish-masculinity, transcendant poetics and harrowing visions of the beauty of small things. Left me with a vivid feel of Paris, French-ness, fatherhood, marriage and the function and futility of philosophy.Short and remarkably written."
5,good cream,"Fast delivery. The cream is very nice, the skin is very delicate, the texture of the skin smoother. Almost no odor. I'm still happy. For wrinkles do not know, I use recently."
2,Breakout time!,"I sure wish I'd read these reviews before I purchased the cream, although because my skin is not sensitive I probably would have felt that my skin wouldn't have the break-out reactions experienced by others. When I first applied the cream, my skin felt great - velvety and well-protected. Within 15 minutes, however, my face began to itch. Within two days I had red bumps, some little white heads, and a blotchy complexion. I discontinued use two days ago and my skin is beginning to recover. Who knows what they put in this stuff, but I highly encourage folks to avoid it - or at least test it out before purchasing."
3,a little disappointing,"Have only seen the first show, but so far the quality of the picture is very disappointing. The dvd has not been restored. Looks like a low quality old VHS tape. Quite unlike the vintage Perry Mason and Twilight Zone dvd's, where there is a sharp black and white picture."
3,Route 66 season 1,"Great show but the copy is very dark and contrast is very bad. I don't know why Route 66 has been so hard to get after 47 years, now it is available and such poor quality."
4,It works well for us. We are ordering a second one!,"We bought the LM900 LitterMaid several months ago because our cats starting using the carpet instead of their boxes. They love the LitterMaid and so do we. We noticed that 'scoopable' litter that does not specificically state that it is 'clumping' litter does not work as well (it gets caught in the teeth of the machine). The clumping litter works very well. [Alittle noisy, but doesn't bother us a bit. Hearing the machine is a sweet sound in comparison to hearing the cat urinating on our carpet!] we are buying another so we will now have one upstairs and one downstairs."
4,Saves on my asthma.,"I'm not really allergic to cats, what I am allergic to is exposed kitty litter that has been used. The Littermaid so far has handled al of the cat waste very well."
1,LITTERMAID MEGA,"We are on our third littermaid. The first one we bought about 10 years ago and it worked great. The second one (Mega) worked okay until one of the plastic gears broke and we couldn't buy the part so we had to buy a new Mega. This one is a piece of junk. Apparently, they have changed the motor and now it is not powerful enough to push the clumping litter into the box and continuously gets stuck. Since I spend so much time cleaning the box myself, I might as well have a regular litter box. I will never buy another littermaid product."
5,great!,this is my third litterbox like this. i have two cats. it keeps the dogs out of the litter and also keeps down the smell. i purchased the elite(new) version and took it right back. it did not work as well as this version. i called customer service and she told me that i was right it was worthless. i am very happy with this product and i received it in less than a week.
4,good deal,This was a significant savings over buying it in my local store. I checked the prices and at the least saved $20 and didn't have to lug it home.
4,Great when it works,"I owned one of these for two years and loved it. It was noisy, yes, but well worth it to save myself the daily scooping (and to provide a cleaner environment for my two cats). Two years to the day after I purchased my first Littermaid the motor died. I re-ordered immediately. My second Littermaid was defective; the motor stopped working for no reason after only a few days of use. I got a replacement from Amazon, but its motor died after a few weeks. Amazon won't send any more replacements, so I either have to order from elsewhere or try a different box. Bummer!"
3,"It's still a lot of work, but it doesn't smell as bad.","My house is very small and I have 3 cats, so it doesn't take long for my whole house to stink. I don't have room for more boxes. The littermaid self cleaning box using clumping litter sweeps the mess into the receptacle, but it doesn't empty itself, and emptying must be done everyday. On the other hand, my kids don't want to change the clay litter because the urine smell is so strong. The clumping litter takes care of that part. Having it go into a box with a lid to be thrown away takes care of most of the poop smell, so I get more cooperation. I use shopping bags in the receptacle box, so that part is practically free. I'm still using the first box that came already in place. As far as the litter that gets scattered, (I read complaints in other reviews)I have to sweep the floor anyway, so that part is no different. My only other alternative (smell or work) is to get rid of my cats and that's not going to happen."
3,Not too many cats,"The biggest issue I had with these is that if you have more than 2 cats, it gets jammed up. One cat goes, then the next one goes to cover up the first one - usually this happens before the unit rakes, then the next one goes to cover up the 2nd one - again before the unit rakes. When this happens there is too much to rake for the power of the motor and it jams up.It would probably work if you have one cat."
2,DON'T DO IT!!!,My cat has blown two of these things up by peeing/spraying on the motor. You would think a litterbox would be BUILT to be peed on...but nope...and they do NOT make it easy to get it replaced. Waste of money if you've got a sprayer!!
3,There is a cheaper option,I've purchased several different types of automated litter boxes over the years and they usually last between 1 - 2 years. The Littermaid product was the best one. I could usually go about a week between cleanings. You still need to clean off the rake and strain the litter with a scooper.A better/cheaper option is to just use additional non-automated litter boxes. With one cat I use two litter boxes and clean them once a week with a straining scooper. If you have a really picky cat(s) or several cats and limited space this may not be an option - or you may have to empty them more often than once a week.Good Luck!
4,I like it -- but the cat doesn't,"I thought this litter box would make my life easier with my three cats... well, one of my guys is afraid of it! The motor noise when the litter box cleans itself and the moving rake sent my Russian Blue to the big flower pot instead! He won't even enter the same room anymore. So now I have a regular litter box in one room and the LitterMaid in another. Eventually all three cats visit the regular box most of the time, so I end up scooping the way I have done for years. The LitterMaid has become an expensive luxury item.Before you invest this amount of $$ find out if your cat belongs to the ""easy-going"" type..."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I HATE IT!!! It's actually worse than a regular litter box. I use the clumping litter that they recommend, and it clumps all right, and then sticks to the scrapping tines. Also, the scrapping tines are a good 1/2 inch above the bottom of the box, so there are always clumps and lumps left in the box. It cost a lot of money, and I'm throwing mine out with the garbage."
2,Crap!,I like it-but it does freak out the cat. That's ok because my cat is neurotic anyway. The ramp doesn't help much as the cat leaps over it leaving cat litter everywhere. Why doesn't someone invent cat litter that doesn't track!!!! Update...bloody thing broke after 3 months!
4,This is a Good Product,"We have two of the Littermaid Mega LM900 litter boxes, and would buy another one. They work reasonably well, and save a lot of scooping time & effort. As other reviewers have noted, it works OK, but not perfect. Help is needed at times, but it's still a big benefit to have. The rakes need to be cleaned periodically, since the clumps are not fully dried after 10 minutes. And the litter needs to be redistributed away from the collection box several times each week as a result of the rakes getting filled with wet clumps. Our cats used it almost immediately after it was set up, and still seem to enjoy watching it operate.We have had one unit for about 18 months, and added a second recently. Both work equally well. We use plastic grocery bags in the collection box, which is easier than using the plastic boxes. You may wish to add a timer to turn it off over-night, so it doesn't wake you."
2,Litter Maid,"The quality control on this item is awful. The first one I received did not work. There was some sort of electrical problem. I returned it and Amazon immediately sent a replacement and that one was missing the AC Adapter. When I called about it, I learned that they would have to send me an entire new product and I would have to pay for it until they received the returned item (which is very large and cumbersome and hard to send). So I kept the one without the adapter since I had an old adapter to use. My complaint is not with Amazon, but rather with Littermaid. It has very poor quality control."
3,They break often,I have had three of these and they all last about a little over a year. You have to keep them very clean and it is much worse than just cleaning out a cat box now and then. The plastic trays which catch the waste are not too expensive but they add up. Just be aware of that.
4,Littermaid Self-Cleans,"The biggest learning curve is making sure NOT to overfill the cat litter. Overfill at all & it makes a mess. At the appropriate (low) level of litter, it works quite well. Both of our cats adapted without a problem. (We did set it up unpowered for three days with cat litter from the previous box.)"
2,Good idea - poor quality,"I just had a second of these boxes die on me, each lasting a little over a year. Electronics in this product are very poor quality - in both cases they just stopped working correctly, I can re-animate my last one by randomly pressing little switches inside but this is not an acceptable use for a $100 product.Great idea, bad implementation."
5,Older is better,"I had 2 of these in the past 15 years and loved them,I decided to get the bigger one for multi cats I beleive it was called the Mega..Well stick with this one cause the Mega is so cheap only lasted 2 years and really isn't any much bigger then this one..Mine came with the plastic hood and didn't think my cats would use it but they like the thing..Totally reccomend this make and model..."
3,I do not own one of these...but do have 2 cats,"Ok, I don't own this, but have thought about it. After discovering arm and hammer cat box deodorizer...I can live without the littemaid. I buy cheap litter because I've heard that clumping litter can be bad for kitties because they lick their paws and it can cause intestinal blockage. I keep the box, garbage bags, the litter and the deodorizer in the closet - every 3rd day or so I just dump the whole box and add new litter and the deodorizer. I do smell it right after the kitties go - but not shortly thereafter. Try this, if you are leary of buying the litter maid. I rated it a 3 since I have no experience and it seems a lot of people hate this thing!"
1,Not worth the trouble and money!,"I spent two months trying to get it right. Which brand of ""recommended"" litter won't stick to the rake? How much is just enough litter? (use too much and the rake can't return to its starting position and will keep repeating its cycle) How often should I add another cup of litter? My 2 cats went in the same location in the pan, so the receptacle overflowed after one day. Also, the rake would pull the clump and litter away and then they would urinate on a pan without litter! Not a good smell! This did not liberate me from cleaning the box, I was dealing with litter box issues twice as often!(...) PS: Don't bother with the privacy tent. It wraps UNDER the tray, so when litter misses the receptacle it is trapped in the tent and you can't easily get it out. What a pain."
3,Not worth the money,"Whether or not this litterbox is for you (or your cats) is best determined by how clean you (and especially your cats) like their box. Yes it cleans itself. Sort of. All major clumps of cat waste are cleaned out. However, it leaves little tiny ones ALL over the place. So then you find yourself back in the same old dilemna - with your handy scoop trying to clean it out. Only, these pieces are so small, they go right through your scoop, making you spend a very long time trying to get the box clean and making your cats constantly shuffle the litter all around trying to find a clean place. Also, waste gets stuck in the rakes, which is pretty gross and not at all fun to clean. For some people (and cats) this might not be a problem. If its not, then this box might be for you. I myself wish I had my money back."
1,Cleaning litter box,I bought this cat box and the motor went out in less then three months. Over a hundred bucks down the drain....Teri from CA
3,Better than manual,"I have gone through two of these over a 6 year period, so am pretty familiar with the unit. The drawbacks are that it's motor makes an unpleasant and loud grinding noise during normal operation, it's waste receptacle is small (I use a small trash-can liner to line the receptacle--makes it easier and cheaper to change), and unless the litter level is uncomfortably low, the unit will have to make several passes to level it and stop grinding! Not fun at night. There are many times I've stomped downstairs at 3am to fix this mad cycling so I could get some sleep. I'd say it's a good unit for small cats who don't make a lot of urine (my cat is 13 and does). And it's far superior to the Performa Automated Littercare System, which looks better but is atrocious."
2,A mess,"I purchased the LM900 after we brought home our third cat so the litter box wouldn't have to be scooped 3x a day and to keep odor down.Although it does reduce odor by keeping the waste in the closed bin, it requires WAY TOO MUCH MAINTENANCE. If your kitty likes to use the corners as one of mine does, you will be scraping cement-like messes off the bottom, the corner and out of the rake on a daily basis, if not more often. I even use the silicone spray recommended by other reviews and ""premium"" litter... all to no avail. Litter all over the floor around the box as well as under the waste bin is also a problem. I spend as much or more time maintaining this box as I would a conventional one.Not worth the cost."
2,Motor failed after a few months,"I have 4 cats and have gone through two Littermaids. After both of them broke I have given up.Cons- very noisy, wakes you up at night- gets stuck a lot. When it does, it doesn't intelligently back up or stop, it keeps trying to move forward making a loud clicking sound- it can only handle a very small amount of litter otherwise it gets overloaded- the whole thing feels cheaply made. The motor is week and the plastic is flimsyI love the concept of an automatic litter cleaner like this, unfortunately it just doesn't perform."
2,Poorly Designed,"I've had two of these. The first one lasted 3 days and was returned because it was defective; the second one lasted about 8 months. Considering the cost, that's a pretty poor life span. Clunky, noisy and difficult to clean, while I think the overall concept is good, this thing is very poorly designed. If you have one cat that doesn't use the litter box that much, you might get your money's worth out of this product, otherwise, don't get your hopes up."
1,LitterScam -5star,"I took a chance and purchased the almighty littermaid a while ago. To my dismay I have found this product to be a futile investment. After two weeks of improper cleaning and extensive spreading of litter from my 3 cats outside of the box, I could not take it anymore. The main problem would have to be the motors lack of power and the exposed adapter wire for it. My cats while taking care of business inadvertently scratched and shredded the power line that leads into the motor. Without much effort the overpriced littermaid became a rather large and stank filled paper weight. I would not and will not purchase or suggest other people to purchase this expensive and disheartening product."
5,great box,"This is a great invention...no more scooping daily, much less smell, much less mess. We have one cat & empty the recepticle weekly. Yeah, the poop stinks when the recepticle is in the trash, but duh, it's cat poop! Take the trash out. The litter does stick to the rake but not enough to stink or really accumulate. We did have the cat tent also, but it didn't really improve smell & didn't seem to ever fit right.Only complaint: it broke after about 18 months, motor died. But it might have been due to a second cat we used to have, which had issues & pooped about 6 pounds a week."
2,LitterMate a loser,"I have had three littermate kitty pottys. You'd think I would have learned after the first two. It's such a great idea to have a Loo which sweeps the poop into a closed container....wrong!!! My cat pees straight toward the back and gets the automatic rake soaking. When it moves forward, it accumulates a large blob of clumped litter which sticks in the tines of the rake and won't come off unless I go with the cleaner tool and manually clean off the tines. This happens once or twice a day. It works ok for solids, but terribly for liquid waste. Not a good design. I have tried to contact the company to no avail despite 60-70 minutes on the phone....from these waits, I get a canned response which has no bearing on my problem. They are impossible to contact by phone. I won't buy # 4 and am sorry I bought the first three.Wishful User"
1,Junk!,"This was my 3rd Litter Maid. The first two lasted a little over a year each. It was worth it to me not having to clean a litter box everyday. This one did not work out of the box. I followed the setup directions and plugged it in. The rake just started going back and forth non-stop. After a little investigation, I found a limit switch that tells the electronics that the rake is in the ""home"" position. If I pressed my finger on this switch very hard, the rake would finally stop. DO NOT buy this model from this seller. It's junk!"
1,if only there was a ZERO STARS rating...DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!!,"I previously had a Mega which worked a couple years. This one was a Total Disaster. Never could get rake to work, Littermaid customer service (once you finally get to is) was of little help and Orange Onion (don't buy anything from them) sucked. They couldn't care less, at least Littermaid apologized (on one of my three calls). Keep in mind, if you buy it and return it, do it through Littermaid. You only need to send back the battery cover and that blasted pull wire. To get that out ( NO help from Littermaid!), unscrew every single screw and once you get your hands on that wire, don't let it go! Or you have to take out the rest of the screws by the battery compartment. I wasted hours and hours on this. If only they had a good competitor. They're sending me the only thing available, the latest model that most people here seem to hate. sigh..if it doesn't work, I'm giving up totally on Littermaid. I have two cats, so it had its uses."
3,Probably money better spent elsewhere,"This product had such mixed reviews that I was really tentative about trying it, but was persuaded by a coworker to give it a go.I did not use the special LitterMaid litter since it was not locally available, instead I used some of the Arm and Hammer Multicat stuff which claimed to be fast clumping. Unfortunately it was not fast clumping enough. The rake goes 10 minutes after the cat leaves the box. Even though I sprayed the rake with Pam, kitty poo would still get all stuck up in the rake. In addition all of the urine soaked litter would get pushed towards the front of the box, but not actually into the receptacle creating a rather unpleasant lump of stinky ickiness.I tried using it for about 4 months but have given up and gone back to a traditional scoop it yourself litter box."
1,High price but cheap parts,"The Littermaid Mega is absolutely one of the worst purchases I have ever made. In less than two months time, the unsubstantial motor has burned out completely. Litter Maid claims that the boxes should need to be emptied every five days for one cat. Well, I have two cats and had to empty the box two times daily. The Litter Maid is good for controlling odors when it works, but it constantly jammed and then shut down (and I used a recommended brand of premium cat litter). After a few weeks of this load, the tiny (and very loud) motor simply gave up. I'm waiting to hear from Litter Maid regarding warranty repair/replacement, but I suspect I'll end up returning to a traditional $5.00 litter tray. The overall concept of the Litter Maid is good, but without sturdier components, it ends up being trash in no time."
4,Importance of physical design to organisational behaviour,"Treats the physical environment of the workplace as an important strategic element in changing organizational culture. The first two parts of the book make the case, the third outlines a broad philosophy of design and ways of treating space to meet relationship needs.Most people concerned with change management do think about physical design issues: this book is helpful in framing the issues and possible solutions and in highlighting the linkage between types of activity and relationship and appropriate physical design. It is written for the generalist manager or OD specialist and does not go into architectural detail, but does clearly highlight the way in which physical space affects culture and performance. It is easy to read and has some very wry cartoons scattered through it."
4,Jetsons,"We have gotten through the set & my 7 & 8 year old boys have loved it. So much fun to see how many things have become everyday products in our lives since I was a kid. Also, noting what would still be awesome inventions for the future."
1,dissapointment,"I bought this product for mixing flour, the flour used to spill all over the counter through the opening.I suggest not to go for this product. lot of mess"
1,Mini-Mess,The opening on this unit is not even large enough to slice a pepperoni stick. It also has problems with foods not properly dropping from the chute but flying all over instead.
2,Works well HALF the time,"The chopper/grinder works very well -- but the the shredder/grater with chute is just horrible. As the other reviewer said, the grated food sprays out all over the work surface instead of into whatever container you innocently intended.I'm very disappointed in this design -- I had another B&D small food processor with a grater/shredder WITHOUT the chute which lasted for nearly 14 years. When that finally gave up the ghost about 2 months ago I bought this one, and I'm sorry I did.I guess it's back to hand-grating cheese again and scraping my knuckles . . ."
2,HALF PLEASED,"I was so in hopes that this 2 cup Black & Decker mini food processor would be as good as the smaller 1 1/2 cup Black & Decker mini food processor that I had that gave me many of years of use and finally wore out. I purchased this new one and am only half pleased with it. I think that Black & Decker needs to go back to the drawing board and build a better shredder/slicer continuous flow chute. It dispenses more stuff down the sides and front of the unit than it gets in the bowl.Also the plastic bowl is of real flimsy quality compared to my other mini processor, so one better handle it with care when attaching and removing it from the unit. The one thing that is OK with this processor is the chopping blade. It does as good of a job as the other one that I had."
1,Defective Chopper,"DAM Distributors LLC sold this item and it was defective. We had had one of these before and loved it, but after several years it wore out. We purchased this one becauseo of our previous experience. When my wife used it for the first time, the blade would not turn and the motor sounded like it was going to disintegrate. I don't know if this was just a defective unit or if it was just a bad unit, but by the time we realized the problem, the return window was up.Black & Decker MFP200T MiniPro 2-Speed Food Processor with 2-Cup Bowl"
5,works great!,I purchased from Amazon. The product was not available on the store shelves in my area. This product works very well. I always keep in my medicine supplies.
5,Favorite Antacid,"I love the taste of this product. It is effective and works well. I like this much better than tums because I feel like one of these lasts a long time while I keep having to chew tums every two hours or so to get the same affect. It is more expensive, but I would recommend these over tums if you are a constant heartburn sufferer. Of course, like the instructions say be sure to go to the doctor if you have to constantly use a product like this. Better to get the cause of your problem resolved than to cover up the symptoms."
1,DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS ONE,"This is the worst coffeemaker I have every used. I can't believe that anyone had a good experience with this coffee maker. You have to babysit this coffeemaker when you turn it on. If not, the basket will spill coffee grounds all over your counter. You have to hit the bull's eye when placing the coffee pot on the coffee maker.(Because of sneak a cup feature) I called the manufactor to complain, they could care less about my complaint. I am very unhappy with Black and Decker. Hope this reveiw helps someone to avoid this frustration."
1,NOT PLEASED AT ALL,"This was a purchase for a friend of mine who collects frogs. I was under the assumption that I would be getting five different colored 1.5 frogs. That is my error for not reading more clearly. However, I was going to return the frog, but I would be out more money than what the frog itself cost. So I decided to keep it. Maybe it would help if you could choose the color of the frog since you only get one, and that might help too with people like me, who did not quite grasp the concept that you would only get one frog."
5,Kickstart Your Creativity,"I sat down one afternoon and read this book cover to cover. It doesn't take long, and I'd recommend you read it rather than skim it. There are so many great ideas, simple ways to make a photograph better. I have really enjoyed trying out the tips. My photos are better already. I even bought another copy as a gift for a friend."
3,Nice features,"I really liked the features on this monitor such as the light show, my baby loved this and it really seemed to help her relax for bed. I also liked the remote and being able to turn the light show on and talk to her from remote. However, the volume for the music was just way too loud and the volume button didn't seem to work for me. I also turned the light show on one time and didn't even know it. I did get a lot of static at times but when I moved the reciever it got better. I did like this monitor overall for the features but I wish it was more sensitive to sounds."
3,good monitor,"My baby loves this monitor. The ceiling lights up with smiley faces, and he lays there watching them while he falls asleep. If he's not quite ready and it shuts off, he tries to reach it through his crib to turn it back on. Usually, he just falls asleep though. I don't like the occassional static and loud noise that other users have reported. It doesn't happen that often with mine."
1,"Great show, terrible monitor",My baby loves the light and sound show but the monitor part of this is terrible! At random times and in random places the monitor will click and get static. Seems mostly to do with electrical interference. I would not recommend this product and am going to pursue returning mine.
1,Poor performance,"The montior has an intermitant clicking noise that is very loud. The monitor also has a significant amount of interference. The light show function has mysteriously turned on during the middle of the night (no the 1.5 month old did not turn it on). The baby does enjoy the light show.... but for [the price] the money would be better spent on something else. We are still searching for another monitor to replace the Fisher Price ""keep the parents up at night"" monitor. 1-20-03 purchased a sony monitor off of the the sony web site (27 channels and 900 mhz) Monitor works well (very quiet and clear reception) and includes a voice activation mode. We still use the fisher price monitor for the light show but for [$$] you are better off buying the sony monitor for a good night's sleep. Too bad amazon does not carry the sony moniotr."
2,"Click, Click, Click....","I loved the idea of the lightshow and being able to talk back to my baby, but when I plugged it in the reciever end continuously clicks, to where it is cutting out parts of the sound from the babies room, SUPER annoying!!! I liked it so much, I took it back and got another one, SAME problem. Now every once in a while the end that goes in the babies room make a very loud static sound. I have not had my baby yet and if that scary sound would have woken her up I would have been a very unhappy mom! I guess I am taking it back today."
3,"We love it, but.....","This monitor has so many wonderful features, why couldn't they just add one more -- 2.4 gigahertz technology. The parent's unit makes this very annoying clicking noise that becomes unbearable when it is not plugged in. Like the other reviews, our monitor also turns on when our son cries and it is not voice activated (I had to read the booklet just to make sure). Our son loves the projection and the sound quality is great, but we are returning ours because we just can't deal with the clicking any longer."
1,"I love it, but...",I had the same problem that one of the other people had. It (the music)turnes on and off when my baby cries and it's not voice activated. I just bought it today and I guess I will be returning it tomorrow. Maybe the next one will work right. I will be exchanging for the same product. The rest of the features are great! As long as you don't have the same problem I've had - this is the perfect monitor.I'm giving this a second review! I returned the first monitor for another one and it too didn't work. I gave up on it and I'll be doing some research on getting another. I did notice more static on the second monitor. This I guess is just a poor product. Usually I am very faitful to Fisher Price. I guess they can't always have the best.
1,NOT a good monitor,"This product is a good toy but NOT a good monitor. My daughter loved the light show but the monitor had so much static that I could not hear her in her room. My husband went into the nursery and talked to me and I could not hear him either not to mention I could not sleep with all the noise this monitor made. There are other product to buy that provide the light show. The most important feature of a monitor is to provide safety for your child.I was told that these days it is hard to find a monitor that will work with all the cell phones and other electronics of our times. We bought the Sony monitor with 27 channels and it works really well, NO static and is very clear."
3,Like it and hate it!,"I find this monitor to have a lot of functions to it. They are great when they work. The first time I used the lightshow, it played for around 5 minutes, and then the bulb burned out. Of course, no extra bulbs are included, so you have to find a place to sell these bulbs...I have since gone through about 10 bulbs. Try to explain to a baby why he can't watch something that he is fascinated by. I have tried to contact Fisher Price about 3 times, but not heard back from customer service as of yet. So, for the time being, I replace the bulbs.The remote function to turn on the light show or talk to your baby is a great feature! Music is relaxing to the baby, and it's easy to use.If you can get past the replacing of the bulbs, it's not a bad product....maybe I should just try & purchase another one and return this lemon!"
1,Not A Monitor!,"I am down stairs at this very moment listening to this annoying thing (Tic, tic, tic). Most of the reviews that I have read thus far have been right on it. I thought that it would be a great thing to have a monitor/toy for my baby's nursery. You cannot hear your child when he cries unless he SCREAMS. The point is, this is supposed to be a monitor with added bonus of sounds and lights for the baby. It's not a monitor at all! My 4 month old son just recently recovered from RSV. When we brought him home from the hospital we needed to keep a close ear on his breathing day and night. It was not possible to hear him cry with this monitor, much less cough, weeze, and choke. I am being quite dramatic I know, but the reason for this piece of equipment is to hear your baby when he needs you. If you want it as a monitor, YOU DON'T WANT IT!"
1,The other reviews are true!!!,"I, assumed the negative reviews must have had something to do with the users problem. I believed fisher price wouldn't make/sell a poor quality item. I believed they wouldn't keep the item on the shelf if it was so bad. So, BELIEVE IT! It has an annoying clicking sound...you can't hear anything above the sound or above the music it plays since the output of music is right next to the microphone (your child's voice won't be as close). It was a great idea but needs a lot of work before this product should be available to consumers."
1,loud,"I have been trying so many monitors, this one is really bad. Ihad the clicking noises, and i hated it. I took it back right away and never used it. I wanted to get a new one thinking that one was broke. I went into [local store] with my screwdriver and battery, pluged it in and the same noises again. I called the company they said it was normal, no way, not normal to me...."
1,It has a mind of its own!,When baby cries the monitor's lights and sounds go on and off and on and off.... (It's supposed to go and and stay on to soothe baby) There's too much static and when you have the parent unit on battery power it makes a LOUD clicking noise.Baby does like to look at the projection on the ceiling but we had to get another monitor (900 mHz - love it!) to monitor.Don't waste your $ on this one.
1,STATIC!!!,I took this monitor back because the static was so loud I could not sleep and I could hardly hear the baby. The static did not improve when I tried to move the montior and receive around the house. This is a product you do not want to buy!!!
1,Great Features - BAD Static,"The features that prompted me to register for this item seemed so baby and parent friendly. I was hoping I would be one of the lucky few that had this monitor work as promised. However, the rhythmic static I experienced was unbearable. I exchanged it for the Fisher Price Sounds N Lights with 2 receivers and I am very happy I made the switch."
1,almost useless,"I was given this item and found the monitor aspect extremely poor quality. It has terrible reception and the listening device clicks constantly. The ceiling projection is very sweet though, so we bought a Clear and Near monitor with infinitely better sound quality and a rechargeable receiver and I leave the Fisher Price monitor set up just as an image projector."
1,A very poor monitor at too high a price,Terrible reception! We live in a one bedroom apartment and the reception is horrible from a mere 15 feet. Very poor sound quality. Plus there is in fact a continuous clicking noise that never stops (see other reviews). This monitor was a complete waste of money and sadly we had to purchase another. We've tried cheaper monitors at friend's and family's houses and they are all far superior. Also the light and sound features are not all that great...you'd be better off using a different monitor in conjunction with a sound machine. I recommend that you do NOT buy this product.
2,Good Idea very bad reception,I had recived this as a gift and of course wanted to try it out before its to late to bring it back in case of any problems. The features were great and being able to talk through them in neat. But the reception is HORRIBLE. we kept hearing this constant clicking noise that wouldn't go away. We tried to move it and to switch the channels but that didn't help. I think the features are nice but i think thats what causes all the interference with the product. I am going to take this back and get something else. For $50.00 you would think that this would work better.
2,CLICK-CLICK-CLICK,"the thing is neat but, it has this constant click--click--click! if the click would stop i would be satisfied but it is so annoying! sometimes the click is low but other times it is so loud! i also have a friend who is having the exact same problem. it is not interfearence and there is nothing i can do to stop it! i try to turn the volume down some but if it is too low i can't hear my baby! i am seriously considering returning the product. too bad, my daughter loves the light show but as a monitor it is not very good!"
2,lights out,"My baby loved the light show...that is until the bulb burned out after the first 5 minutes I owned it--makes it way more inconvenient and costly than I bargained for. My receiver also had that annoying clicking sound, but so did the Evenflo I tried. The clicking is bearable if you keep the volume down a bit, but that does somewhat defeat the purpose. I did notice that when she made any noise, her voice faded in and out. Didn't notice the light show turn on by itself, but I don't think I had enough time before the bulb blew. I am really disappointed that I had to return it because I think my baby would have really enjoyed it, but without the monitor working well, all of the fun features become useless."
2,Great features...Horrible quality,"I purchased this monitor, mainly because of the neat features and because of the manufacture. The features of this product are wonderful but the main idea of a monitor is to be able to hear your baby when you are not in the same room. The receiver makes a horrible loud clicking sound making it nearly impossible to hear the baby. It also becomes very annoying when you are trying to sleep not only because the clicking noice keeps you awake but the fact that you are not sure if it is picking up noises your baby may be making. I returned the product immediately and purchased a cheaper Fisher Price Monitor called Sounds N' Lights and it works fine. The Soothing Dreams Monitor would be great if Fisher Price could fix the bugs in it. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Do not buy this monitor!!,"We bought this monitor for our newborn because it seemed like a really neat product. However, the receiver has an ANNOYING clicking noise that absolutely drives me crazy!!!!! Forget about sleeping with it in your bedroom. The clicking is so loud you can't hear the baby! Also, the two way button it didn't always work! We took it back for a refund and bought a less expensive model with better clarity in sound."
1,Is there anything less than 1 star?!,"This monitor is the worst ever I think. There is so much noise coming from the receiver that my husband and I couldn't sleep with it going. We slept on a couch outside of our baby's room till we could get a new monitor. Don't waste your time or money on this. The light show is pretty neat, but the noise cancels out anything good about the special features. I feel guilty we put it on our registry and someone bought it for us. I feel like giving them their money back!"
1,Not worth the money,"The Fisher Price Soothing Dreams Monitor is a waste of money because the reception is not clear, and there is a pulsing noise every three seconds or so. It also gets periodic loud bursts of static. I tested it out with my 4 year old daughter while I was downstairs and she was upstairs playing, and I could not hear what she was saying unless she was right near the monitor. She could hear me, however, which is one feature I liked. My main concern was being able to hear my baby, and this monitor gives off too much static."
2,Can't use it as a monitor,"I received this as a gift at my shower and love the idea of it. However, we live in an apartment complex and the static is so bad on both channels that it is unusable as a monitor. Additionally, it has a ghostly tendency to turn itself on. While someone's garage door opener is the likely culprit, it is very unnerving to hear nighttime cricket sounds start coming out if it -- especially when you are on the opposite side of the room. Still, my son likes the light show, so we are probably going to hold on to it and play with its other aspects."
2,Disappointed,"The light show was great - my baby really enjoyed it. However, the monitor feature was terrible. There was a constant whirring/clicking sound that would sometimes get very loud. It was impossible to sleep with this monitor on. Also, the light show tended to go on for no reason at different times. Sometimes, this would actually wake the baby. I called Fisher price and they said that their testing also showed the monitor problems I discussed (but not the light show going on by itself)..."
1,Soothing Dreams Monitor by Fisher-Price,"Sorry guys but I have to say this is the biggest piece of junk I have bought. From the time we plugged it in, it was all static. I went and bought the TV monitor which I love and works great instead. I decided to use the soothing dreams monitor as a light projector for my son. Oh well, it probably took about a week to stop working. I took it back and exchanged since I had no receipt and so far it's sitting in a corner collecting dust. Don't waste your money on this monitor it's not even worth the money"
2,At least my son enjoyed the ceiling show,"I regestered for this before relizing this site did ratings on products. When I received it at my shower I was delighted. That was till I set it up threw the box away and tried to use it. Horrible!! The static was so loud it kept my husband and I awake. I ended up having to shut it off, which meant I still didn't sleep.(Neverous new mom) My son does enjoy the light show. That's the only good use I get from it. I was really shocked that this monitor was so badly made. Fisherprice usually makes wonderful products. I ended up getting Fisherprice's Sound and Lights monitor. This one's extremely better made and less expensive. No light show, but now mommy can sleep."
3,Great for Privacy,"Ok I have to agree with everybody on the way it is made. However, my kids (cats) would never use it without the tent. Therefore, even with the flaws of the plastic rods not being sturdy enough and the tightness of fit, I am getting my monies worth as my kids (cats) are now using it. In fact they won't look at the old boxes now. I have already purchased my second box and considering an alternative to the tent that will be more practical. And for the liners....use small trash bags or grocery bags to help defray the cost of the liners....those suckers add up if you have to replace them every other day like I am doing. Also instead of the charcoal get the odor control lava rocks and put on the inside of the tent it will help with the smell and can be recharged in the sunshine. Hope this helps!!"
1,Horrible quality...don't waste your $,The tent cover is too small for the post assembly. The zipper is defective and would not thread the teeth properly. I tried to get the cover on for over an hour before throwing it in the trash.
3,"Could be sturdier, but does the trick","I have had the same tent for three years, compared to the other reviews, I guess I've been lucky? I had a top frame joint break within a month, but lived for years with it that way.I love that the litter is contained within the tent, and I don't have to look at a litterbox every time I walk in the door. The main goal was to keep the dog out of the litter, and it worked for a couple years.Unfortunately the dog figured out that this flimsy plastic frame was no match for her 90 pounds and she busted up the front set of supports so that the tent collapsed. If I could only get just the framing, I don't need the cover.I will buy another tent, hopefully I can get a couple years out of it. I tried replacing it with the *new* Littermaid Kitty Kabana, but it's too small for my LM920, so I really do have to go back to the full-sized privacy tent."
1,Bad quality plastic!,"In doing routine assembly, the ends of two framework rods just broke off in shards. I have never seen such brittle, poor quality plastic used in a product like this."
1,...don't waste your money,"We love the LitterMaid litterbox but the tent is beyond bad. Everything about it is of poor quality. The zipper breaks easily and is difficult to zip up because the plastic tent is slightly undersized for the tent structure formed by cheap plastic rods... Flimsy to the core, the plastic rods met their death when our average sized 10 lb cat decided to explore the universe from the top of the tent.The concept is great -- privacy for the cats, spares us of seeing them do their thing, and it helps with the odor. ..."
1,Don't waste your money - it's unbelievably bad!,"It comes disassembled and does not go together easily. It took us about an hour, which wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so expensive. Also, it blocks the door that you have to open to empty the tray. The zipper broke. In order to clean the pan, you have to unzipper the top, so we're completely screwed. I have never seen such poor engineering and materials. Littermaid should be ashamed of themselves."
1,Not really impressed!,"Because I have the older version of the Littermaid self cleaning litter box and have 2 cats, the privacy tent is kind of a necessity to keep the litter confined to the box. However, for what they charge for the tent, it is not very durable. I have had the Littermaid for a little over a year and a half and this is the third time I have replaced the tent. The frame is made of plastic tubing and connectors. Both my cats like to sit on top of it. One of my cats weighs about 9 lbs and she has broken the connectors several times jumping up onto it. The zipper is cheaply made as well, and it took me 20 minutes to get the teeth to mesh around the whole circumference of the tent. So when I clean it, I don't dare unzip it because I don't want to spend the time to zip it again. Unfortunately, because I need to have the tent, I have to keep replacing it. Littermaid has a newer model now which has a different tent which I hope is better than this one."
3,Littermaid tent gets the job done,I think the littermaid privacy tent is a decsent product. It keeps the litter from getting knocked over the sides. My cat use to enter and exit from the side and in the process would knock litter all over the floor. Now that he is forced to exit thru the opening the litter is trapped on the mat and easy to clean up. It is a little more work to remove the cartridges and add extra litter beacuse of the flaps but none the less it does its job.
1,"Poor, poor quality!!!!","This tent is wonderful in theory. I was very excited when I found this product because I have a cat that likes to play in the litter box occasionally. In the process of him playing he slings litter everywhere. Well the first tent I received was missing pieces and some of the pieces were broke. I sent it back and received another within a few days. The frame assembled easily, but the tent was a pain to get on. The zipper is hard to get together, the tent sits on the frame very snug ( too snug), and my litter box didn't fit in it properly like it said it would. The frame poles snapped in two when I tried to get my litter box in it. ( I have the littermaid elite multiple cat.) I do not recommend this product at all. The quality of the frame is poor and it doesn't fit almost any litter box like they say it does!!!"
5,Wonderful Desserts,I bought this book when it first came out. I have used it weekly since that time. The information given in this book makes it extremly helpful for those with any food issues. The desserts in this book are to be eaten and enjoyed.
4,Great baby bath,"We used this for my son for the first 7-8 months. He loved being in it, and the added extra cup for pouring water on him was nice. The lid to the cup did not stay on though, so we just removed it and used it as a stand alone without the cap.I also received it and there were some blemishes in the blue foam where it looked like a staple had gone through them and ripped it a bit. If I'd bought it from a brick and mortar store, I'd have returned and exchanged it but I kept it as is. We plan on using it for our next child as well!"
1,cracked plastic,Bowl made of thin plastic which gradually cracks out. Also leakage problems. Wouldn't buy again.
2,Not very robust. Replacement parts cost MORE than the whole boxed unit.,"The reviewers who complain of cracked plastic are all too correct. The plastic top piece cracked under pressure (grating asiago cheese) and the bottom tub piece's edge broke as well (albeit after numerous uses) that made using it difficult.But the top piece shouldn't have cracked. Not when it's meant to grate cheese.Note, I had bought a second unit after losing the slicing blade. Ordering directly from B&D;, they wanted $35+S&H; for just the slicing blade. The local store (not walmart) had the whole unit NEW for $30. (prices may have gone down since then.)I'd buy a unit with a better tub and cover. Regular usage is going to render this an oddly shaped paperweight fairly quickly if you use it for anything more dense than onions."
2,Not What I Was Hoping,"I keep Silly Putty at my desk, it's good for relieving tension. I was hoping this would be more like Silly Putty in texture. It's difficult to flatten, or roll into snakes, and it fractures easily (which is actually kinda cool). I can't seem to shape it into anything.The colors are beautiful and rather fascinating, it DOES bounce, feels ""fresh"" as another reviewer described, and is fun to smoosh. I think a young child would put this in his or her mouth the second they could so take care with young kids.An interesting product, but doesn't do much."
2,Not a great product at all,"To begin with when I bought it, it read ""large mars mud"", it is not large at all. It is not elastic, it does not bounce, it doesn`t make any noises, you can not mold it. If your break into pieces, it is not easy for a little kid to put it together again (not very adherent). In conclusion, it is only nice as a curiosity, fresh to touch and nice colors. It would serve for a project at school, but not as a toy."
3,Great maker with a horrible sound!!,"I have been looking for the perfect coffee maker and I thought I had found it. Don't get me wrong, this maker is good. It has a lot of great features, good price, dependable company, etc. Yet it has one amazingly horrible flaw. When it finishes brewing it gives off a loud, ear piercing beep! And not just once, but 4 times! I bought this maker mainly because of the timer/auto-on feature. I wanted to wake up to the smell of coffee. Instead I wake up to a second alarm I can hear clear from my kitchen!!! Because of this I bumped it down from 5 starts to 3."
3,Not hot enough!,The coffee maker works wonderfully except that the coffee is not hot enough. I have resorted to microwaving my cup for 40 seconds to get a decent temperature.
1,short life span,"I bought this coffeemaker 6 months ago and now it is dead. It worked fine while it was alive, but last week it just stopped working. Unless you want to buy one or two new coffeemakers every year, I would avoid this machine."
1,No coffee this morning...yikes!!,"Well, chalk this purchase up to the ""lesson learned"" category. This was a nice coffee pot aside from the fact it was landfill material after a very short life. Got up for coffee to find the heating element pooped out! Black and Decker used to be a reliable brand but not anymore!!"
3,warranty support not robust,carafe lid not very durable. After requesting new carafe lid from manufacturer they shipped wrong size carafe lid.Manf. rep. told me it is a warehouse problem.Still waiting for new carafe lid.
2,Features work for a limited time ONLY!,"I bought this as a gift for my Fiance' for his birthday since he drinks coffee occasionally and I do not. Turns out it worked fine at first...But they claim &quot;You can even fill your cup in mid-brew with the sneak-a-cup interrupt feature.&quot; WRONG! This featured worked for maybe 20 uses! Now, try taking a cup mid brew and the coffee keeps pouring out and doesn't stop like it's supposed to! It's such a lovely feature don't you think? NOT! I am really sick and tired of wasting my money on products that work for a LIMITED TIME ONLY and quit on you!"
1,Deserves O stars. Worst coffemaker sold today,"I bought this because it says no drip. I never knew what drips were, before this coffeemaker. The plastic rim around the top of the glass carafe fills with coffee and pours out on the counter as you pour into your cup. You cannot get inside the rim to clean it, so it looks dingy. I wrote to Black and Decker about it and they say they don't actually make it at all. They farm it out. So when I wrote the appropriate company, I had a response: Tough going, we have our money-don't like it, too bad. As a result-I will not buy anything with the cover name Black and Decker again. On a more positive note: You can spill coffee faster with this pot-it makes it amazingly fast."
4,Good overall,Good all around. Something as simple as the spout shape and easy pouring makes a big difference. If I have any complaints it is that the red on light is difficult to see and distinguish from the red numbers of the clock at a distance. Could have been placed elsewhere or had Green numbers to contrast? Not a big deal since auto off is a good feature to have.
5,B&D SmartBrew Coffeemaker,It works great. This is our favorite style of coffeemaker because when you pour the coffee into the cup it does not drip or dribble.
1,terrible Product,Got my DCM2500 from Sears yesterday. I bought it primarily based on Consumer Reports giving them the second highest score on their site. The thing sucks bigtime. It actually leaks. I am returning it but am never buying Black and Decker Coffee Makers again. If they can make one that leaks there is something wrong with their manufacturing process. I am looking at other brands now.
4,Knaak writes another great one!,"Knaak has always been one of my favorite Dragonlance authors ever since I read the Legend of Huma. His latest tale of the minotaurs does not feature Kaz but his descendent Aryx. Aryx is an impressive character, but instead of developing, he constantly acted as the reluctant hero. This was a little annoying. Also there are a few parts that really drag. But what I liked was that Knaak unlike other authors in the series, he gives us new creatures. The crustacean creatures are very cool and interesting. I was glad when I found out it wasn't just going to be another book where the heroes would fight fire dragons and shadow wraiths(That was getting boring after four books of it). Other authors should learn from Knaak's creativity. Instead of sticking to the same formula, Dragonlance authors should expand their imagination in the world of Krynn. Knaak is truly one of the best, keep um comming Richard."
5,StarTech.com 3.5-Inch Hard,"This is a great product and really does a good job. I had no problems installing it and it cools areas, no other fan system will."
1,Death trap,this habitat is a death trap. gravel is absolutely inadequate for a crab. they need several inches of sand in order to bury themselves or they will die. hermits do not breed in captivity...you would be plucking a crab out of tropical paradise and put them in a tuperware bowl. they also need a specific temperature and humidity level in order to breathe. it would be impossible to achieve that in this container.
1,Coffee Grounds Galore!,"I was excited to find this little coffee pot --- I only drink about a cup and half of coffee in the morning, so this was the perfect size for me. The first night we got it, we made cup after cup of hot tea -- this was GREAT!I made my first cup of coffee the next morning. Oh what a disappointment it was!The coffee grounds bubbled up out of the reservoir creating a mess! In addition, there were coffee grounds IN the coffee itself.We tried cleaning it and making new cups three times -- each time the grounds were everywhere.I thought about keeping it to use for tea....but with the coffee grounds everywhere, it could never be used for just hot water again.This little machine has great potential -- but a serious design flaw!"
1,Used it 2 times and it's dead,"Actually, I have nothing more to add. Turned it on, tested. It worked. Didn't use it for a month. Wanted to make me some coffee one day. Tried to turn it on, but nothing happened: no light, no sounds, nothing. Tried different plugs - nothing, it's dead. Black&Decker wants me to ship it to get a replacement one - I pay for shipping. Too much trouble for $14... Will keep the mug as some bad memories. What a junk...."
4,Not too shabby,"Overall very satisfied. Quick cup of coffee, easy to clean, just wish I realized how short it was because I can't use any of my travel/novelty mugs in it."
1,Pathetic!,"Took it out of the box, filled it up with water, plugged it in...and the damn thing started smoking and making odd popping noises (probably the entire unit shorting out). Then it died. Didn't get even one cup of coffee out of it.I wanted my money back, but B & D (a company I will never buy from again) offered a new coffeemaker of the same model or a ""factory reconditioned"" one. Why would I want another of the exact thing, especially a repaired one, that just blew up in my kitchen?"
4,Great coffee,Easy transaction & wonderful coffee maker. It didn't get five stars because the coffee maker doesn't have a heating element. Worth the price though.
2,Too small mug and way too hot to hold,"I've had the DCM18S for two months, and I've not had any problem with the quality of the coffee it makes or the cleanup of the unit. My problem is with the size of the mug; it's way too small for travel (even my 20 minute commute to work), and the outside of the mug gets extremely hot to the touch, so hot that I have to be careful if I have to hold the mug by the body instead of the handle, which makes me wonder if it's keeping the coffee hot long enough. I've never had this problem before with thermal mugs.All in all, I would not buy this coffeemaker again, mostly for the small size of the mug."
5,Works Great,"We have used this for approximately two years, and it still works great. You must remember to run vinigar through it about every month. My wife uses it every day."
3,OK but makes weak coffee,"I like it because it's very convenient and no pot to clean. However, the coffee it makes is weak and not hot enough. I never have problems with grounds getting into my coffee. Perhaps I use paper coffee filter instead of the permanent filter that comes with it. Overall, it's a good machine if you're not too demanding."
3,you get what you pay for,"my first one of these broke right around the time frame when the warranty was about to run out. it actually sounded like my coffeepot was depressed because it would ""sigh"" and not pump all the water out of the reservoir. i called the company and got a new one. They wanted me to cut off 2 inches of the cord (including the plug) and send it to them before they would send a new one. so i re-wired the plug on first one and it works fine. and now the newer one is starting to ""sigh"", so i'm going to re-wire the second one and i'm sure it'll be fine.other than that it does what it's supposed to."
5,Perfect for a one-cup-a-day house,"It's quick, the reusable filter doesn't make your coffee taste funny, and the thermal travel mug keeps it warm longer than a regular mug if you're like me and get distracted before you remember you made some. I wait a few minutes anyway because it comes out too hot for me, but it's always preferable to have a hot drink that's too hot instead of too cold. It fixes the problem itself in a few minutes.A standard 16-oz straight-walled mug works just as well under it as the one it comes with if you have a favorite. I like to use it with a ""homemade"" Cafepress 16-ouncer at home, and the travel mug on my way to work. It also works fine to heat up tea or cocoa water for other members of the house."
3,Great product for the price,"This one cup coffee maker is efficient at making coffee or heating water. It is a well-made product and good as a countertop appliance. With a few caveats, I can honestly recommend this item. I set it up on the kitchen counter at night with water and a tea bag, then flick it on in the morning for a quick jolt of caffeine when I feed the cat. What it is not is small or quiet. I had hoped to use this at work, but it is too loud and steamy. It isn't much smaller than a full sized coffee maker. It also does not keep the cup hot once it is brewed."
3,not for people that like strong coffee,This is a coffee maker for people that wants a travel mug. If you like strong coffee forget it. There is only a limited amount of coffee grounds you can put in before they spew out into the coffee. You get what you pay for. Cheap price but so-so coffee.
2,Grinds overflow,"This would be a good one cup coffeemaker, however every time I brewed coffee in it the grinds would overflow into the whole coffee pot. This made cleaning the pot after each use difficult and not worth the hassle. Also, this maker does not hold tall coffee cups, if you own lots of those. Overall I would not recommend this coffeemaker. I ended up purchasing a small 4 cup Cuisinart coffeemaker for $30, that works just great."
1,Not worth the money,"After one week I gave the coffee maker to the Goodwill. Even after cleaning, and using several times the coffee tasted like burned plastic."
4,Works well.,"I have been using it for about 15 days. Considering the price, it works better than what I had expected.Pros:1) Small Size, nice style.2) Very easy to operate.Cons (Minor):1) The inbuilt plastic filter lets some coffee grains through. I am using an additional paper filter.2) Once switched on, it will switch off automatically after the whole water is used. There is no manual switching off. (Of course I can unplug. But still..)3) No hot plate to keep the coffee hot."
2,Needs improvement,"Pros: Hot coffee near the correct brewing temperature range; convenient brewing straight into the travel mug; fast brew taking only a few minutes.Cons: No matter how much coffee I put in the filter basket the grounds overflow and get EVERYWHERE...inside the water resevoir, all over the water nozzle, overflowing the filter basket and inevitably into the travel mug. This is a HUGE design flaw that could be corrected with an inexpensive filter cap that could snap onto the filter unit (I hope someone from B&D; reads these).Overall I would not buy this unit again. With such a simple system as a coffee brewer you have to get every detail right and this unit's overflow problem is huge. Using fresh ground coffee is impossible and to me, that is the only type of coffee to EVER use.Lastly, what is up with the price on this thing?! I just bought this a month ago for $23 and now its only $17?! Around Christmas they were selling here for a whopping $60!! What is it, a commodity??"
2,great in theory - not in reality,"I purchased this on 9/13/10. I loved it. Easy to use, easy to clean, and makes a great mug of coffee. However, after using it 1x - 2x a day since purchase, it stopped working on 12/15/10. I have contacted Black and Decker, but am very disappointed in the quality."
1,Major Overflow problems,I tried the coffeemaker twice. Both times the water overflowed back into the water trough. The problem is the hole that allows the coffee to go into the cup. If it is not lined up correctly the coffee backs up. On my unit the only way to get the holes to line up is to manually hold the 2 inserts off to the side. On some units these holes probably line up correctly and then you don't have this problem. This one is going in the garbage.
5,Great for a Single Cup,"I like a cup of coffee (or 2) in the afternoons so rather than making a large pot or going out to 7-ll, Starbucks, McDonalds, etc. bought this Black & Decker unit. Coffee tastes great and it's much cheaper to make my own than go out to get the coffee. My only complaint is that the lid doesn't fit that tightly and there's some dripping should I use the lid. Since I don't use it as a commuter cup and leave the lid off anyway it's not a problem."
5,Coffee maker,I just love it. It makes a cup of coffee in just a few minutes. I keep one in the house that I use every morning and one in the RV.
4,"Still works, I was wrong the first time!","It was great at first. It does make the perfect amount of coffee, and the filter being permanent is a nice touch.I am editing this review because it turns out the power in my kitchen did not work in more than half of the outlets. The coffee maker still works, hooray! Changed it to 4 stars just cause the top did pop/break on a hinge, but it still functions."
1,"Worked for a month, then stopped!!!","I purchased this coffee pot with HIGH hopes.. but after having it about a month and only had used it a total of 10 times it stopped making the full cup of coffee.. It was leaving half the water still in the coffee pot and not brewing it fully! I thought maybe if I ran HOT water through the machine a couple times it might start finishing the full cup but I was wrong. The cup is the only thing good I got out of this product as for the coffee pot itself well, it was worth what it gave me for the price. I threw it away!.. Very disappointing!"
2,Good for 4 months,"Well I am a student and I purchased this model thinking it wasa) cheap (i'm a student)b) small (easy to clean)c) comes with a mug (this travel mug gets a day to day use here)d) black and deckers are usually reliable (...usually)My final review comes to this:1) the above facts hold true2) The coffee filter area is tiny so only a cone will work optimally3) I gave it 2 stars because of it's cheap quality. After a while a burning smell came through with every coffee I made, but would still make coffee so didn't bother me. Then, the coffee maker stopped working after 3 months. Since it stopped, it smelled like burning plastic and I wasn't sure what happened, but I am not too happy about this purchase."
3,Works well- till it goes bad,"I have one of these at home and I really like it so I bought one for a 3 man shop where we don't want to make a 10 cup pot and this one the switch gave out 2 weeks later! I was not very happy, although I have been thinking of buying another one because I really like the one I have in the house!"
5,The only one cup coffee maker that I have owned and it is the best. I just know it is.,"For a few years I have searched for a one cup coffee maker that makes good coffee. This is it I found it on Amazon; thanks Black and Decker. I take my cup with me to meetings, shopping, doing errands etc. The mug fits perfectly in the mug holder of my car. This will make a great gift."
3,A little clumsy...,"To be fair, it makes a good cup of coffee. However, when I got into the ""fancier"" blends, the grains sort of over-flowed the cup/filter where I put them. None of the grains got into my coffee, though. It just made the little contraption more difficult to clean; I have to unplug it, and rinse the whole thing under water, all the time trying not to get water on the electrical parts."
5,Just right!,Perfect coffee maker for a the single cup drinker. Makes the coffee at the right temperature unlike a lot of 12 cup makers where if you make only a couple of cups you have to microwave them to get them hot enough. Excellent deal.
3,Too loud for me,"This is a fine coffee maker. The cup is of decent quality. Takes only a few minutes to make coffee. The coffee is good.But for an office environment, which is what I got this for, it is way too loud. It's not too loud just for the last few seconds, it is loud the ENTIRE TIME IT BREWS. I'm getting comments everytime I use it and it's simply a distraction. So, a fine coffee maker, just not for the office around a lot of people."
2,"Good concept, not good coffee!","I purchased one of these for my office and although coffee is hot, it has a weird taste. I also find grinds in my coffee everywhere. I'm going to purchase a small coffee maker with regular filters to replace this item. The coffee just doesn't taste the same as I make in my home coffee maker. Its a dissapointment."
2,"Very fast, very easy... bad tasting coffee","Don't kid yourself about this machine. The convenience is great, but the quality of the coffee is extremely poor. Get yourself a good, normal-sized coffeemaker with a built-in filter, and you will be much happier."
4,Definitely a 1 cup Coffee maker.,"The coffee maker is good, the permanent filter is convenient. Only complaint is that you can only make one cup at a time, although you can use any coffee cup... not just the cup that comes with the unit. Overall, it is very simple to use and very quick brew. Totally pleased."
1,never worked,"Bought as gift. Never worked, sputtered and brewed 10 seconds and turned off. Spent 45 min on phone first time trying to get replacement. Did all that was requred - mail in plug, send invoice- and have not received replacement. On hold over 20 minutes TWICE NOW as recording tells me my expected wait time is 10 minutes.Some stuff is inexpensive and you don't expect much but this is awful customer service!!!"
2,B&D DCM18S,"After more than 30 years of faithful and triumphant use, my Melitta personal (travel) coffeemaker suffered a broken switch. I was unable to replace it; and settled for the above device as an affordable substitute. ""Affordable"" is about all I can say for it. I really am rather disappointed.(1) a phone call to the manufactrer reveals that no carrying case is available. (2) It has no warming unit. Coffee must be drunk Immediately before it cools off. (3) The accompanying mug has a persistent ""plastic"" flavor which a couple of dishwasher treatments have yet to relieve. Carrying my own mug addresses that; but the other inconveniences are not correctable. The lack of heatingp plate should, especially, be made clear in the promotional sales material."
2,Do you like coffee grounds all over and in your coffee?,"Do you like coffee grounds all over, and in your coffee? It makes okay coffee, except every third run, or when there's too many grounds, and then its grounds in the water well, grounds in your coffee, grounds in the filter housing, and coffee on the counter."
3,good item but cheaply made,This item is a fine product but it is made of cheap plastic. Does just what you would expect. Shipping is also very very slow. It took also two weeks to ship from a very short distance. For some wierd reason they shipped it ups to the post office then the mailman delievered it. I only live a few minutes (2-3) from the post office so this made no sense. The UPS man probably drove past my house to get to the post office.
5,Coffee drinking HEAVEN,We could not be happier. A steaming cup of hot coffee at a moments notice. Every cup as good as the first.
1,Did not work!,"After reading all the reviews, I decided to purchase the DCM18s Brew n Go coffee maker. I followed the instructions on how to use from the start.Had a difficult time pouring the water into the reservoir because of how the door is placed on the unit. The first step to to purge the unit and run just clean water into the unit.That worked and I did a second purging. That's when I notice the unit ran longer than the first run. Finally the unit shut off. I unplugged the unit to make sure everything was okay.I plugged the unit back in and it will not operate. I thought it may have a safety fuse or some kind of overheat prevention that caused the unit to shut down. I read the manual instruction and waited for the unit to rest. No luck. It simply will not turn on after many attempts. So, this unit is going back to amazon.com for a refund."
1,Worked great for six days!,Liked the coffeemaker a lot until on the sixth day instead ofhearing the coffee dripping it started to hum and smoke was streaming out of it. I unplugged it and once it cooled down checked to see if it still worked and it didn't. The motor must of burned out. Unfortunately I had just discarded the packaging so I couldn't return it. I considered it a lesson learned...you get what you pay for!
4,handy for tea also!,"If you start with a new machine that has never made coffee, you can use this item to make a nice cup of tea. It is impossible to remove the coffee oils once they have settled into the cup. I do wish additional cups were available for this produce as the cups are very handy with nice tight tids."
2,Kinda crappy...,"This coffee maker is just kind of crappy, but I should've known that because of the price! It works ok, but the coffee never tastes great and it's kind of a flimsy product..."
4,Problems with my order,"Estimates:Request the purchase of a Black & Decker Brew DCM18S 'n Go Personal Coffeemaker with Travel Mug long ago and did not get to my destination, the prayers for the address, however before I have received my orders to the same address, please ask me make it go as soon as the same address is:International POBA 646 10421 NW 28 th Street d-106 Miami, Florida 33102 United States Phone: 584142110692I look forward to your good offices.Greetings,Yolimar Canela"
1,The worst item I have EVER purchased -,"makes a mess every time - also, I have to immediately put the coffee into the microwave every time to reheat since it doesn't make HOT coffee - lukewarm at best, and undrinkable - (I clicked ONE star only because there is no way to make this a ZERO star item!)"
1,I was Ripped Off!,"I AM A 63 Y/O DISABLED VETERAN, AND I ORDED THIS ITEM WHEN I WAS A PATIENT AT AN OKLAHOMA VETERANS HEALTH FACILITY, TRIED USING IT ONCE THERE AND IT DID NOT WORK PROPERERLY,AND 2 DAYS LATER HAD TO PUT IT IN STORAGE BECAUSE OF CENTER'S POLICLY CHANGE OF COFFEE MAKERS, NOW I HAVE MY OWN APT. AND I REMEMBERED I STILL HAD IT AND TRIED IT AGAIN, THIS TIME WATER AND COFFEE CAME OUT OF THE BOTTOM ONTO MY KITCHEN FLOOR, I FELT LIKE SMASHING IT WITH A HAMMER!! ALSO WHEN I FIRST OPENED THE PACKAGE AND REMOVED THE PLASTIC IT LOOKED OLD AND USED! I HAVE A FRACTURED SPINE AND I WAS BOTHERED BY A LOT OF PAIN AT THE TIME AND I FORGOT TO RETURN THE ITEM SOONER! I HAVE SPENT ALOT OF MONEY ON PRODUCTS FROM AMAZON AND THIS IS THE WORST!! AN ANGRY VETERAN!!!"
4,Perfect for the office,"This little coffee maker is great for the office. It makes a quick cup of hot coffee.Likes:-Large built in filter does not allow the coffee grounds to overflow into the rest of the coffee maker.-Built in filter is easy to clean.-Can fit any kind of mug under the dripper, does not exclusively use the travel mug it came with.-Doesn't take up any space.-Don't have to worry about turning it off.Dislikes:-Sometimes after you take the mug out from under the dripper, it continues to drip a little."
1,Awful Design,"I am so disappointed in this product--it is very poorly designed. The coffee grounds splatter onto the underside of the lid and into the water tank, both of which are very difficult to clean. I have to put the whole thing in the sink to rinse it out everytime I use it. Also, the travel mug is plastic, and no matter how well I clean it, the coffee always has an aftertaste. And maybe it is just me, but I have a very hard time opening and closing the mug's lid--I always end up spilling the coffee! Don't waste your money."
2,Great while it worked...,"Product worked great for 5 months, then mysteriously it quit one morning and never brewed again. Black & Decker offered to replace the unit for a nominal fee of $7.50 for shipping and handling, but I passed. $18 for coffee maker and now $7.50 for the replacement - I'll cut my losses and end up with a nice mug.Good product - lousy service from B&D;."
2,Personal Coffeemaker,"I thought this single cup brewing system was a good idea for someone who doesn't drink a whole pot of coffee, however, my husband said it made the coffee taste funny and he won't use it. Save your money."
3,"It is okay but, I wish appliance designers would redo this","I bought this a while back and getting it half price is about all I would pay for it. If you don't put the baskets back just right it does pour coffee all over the counter. Not a big problem if you pay attention and do it right, but they could have made this easier to see when you first buy the machine. Secondly, the cup/mug has a little quirk that I do not like. It collects water in between the layers of black plastic and silver plastic when you wash it. It doesn't make any difference if you wash it in the dishwasher or by hand it still happens. And I hate such a defect. Why can't designers test these things and redesign these quirks out of the product. The paper filters are nice to use with the machine but you can't buy them anywhere so stock up on them at Amazon when you buy the coffeemaker."
3,the cup is the problem,i love having only one cup but the cup itself was a problem . It took on water in the dishwashing and it spilled over my shirt as I drank out of it. not the coffee but the water in the lining. The handle was a little weak as well. maybe a mor well made cup could improve this item.Black & Decker DCM18 Brew 'N Go Coffeemaker
3,B&D single serve coffe maker,It does what it is suppose to do. The coffe does overflow sometimes in the filter. But for the price it is a decent item.
3,"Simple, fast, good coffee, but...","The good:This machine makes a single, very good cup of coffee quickly and takes up little counter space.The not so good:1. The seal between the mug lid and the cup leaks, so we use the cup as a coffee pot only.2. There is no valve on the bottom of the basket so you can't pull of a partial brew. This is not a major problem, however, since the machine is designed to make a single mug of coffee.3. When we placed the mug in the sink dishwater, the water leaked into the inside of the mug and was very difficult to remove. After the second or third time this happened, I drilling a couple of holes in the outside of the mug to act as drains."
4,good coffee for leftees,This maker works well. I use it every day and have had no problems. I use 2 table spoons of coffee and it makes a great cup.2 cons: the mug is not the standard size so my other mugs won't fit and the water reservoir has to be filled on the left side.
3,Disappointed,"I received this unit this past Christmas as a gift. I've owned a previous model of the Black and Decker single cup coffee maker, and never had any problems. This unit, as some other users have noted, turns on and off periodically AFTER the brewing cycle is complete. I don't know if this is B&D's effort to keep the ""plumbing"" dry after a cycle, but the other unit I owned never did this, and it lasted for 6 years. This new unit, now 5 months old, has now died. I put water/coffee into it, turned it on, and the power intermittently goes on and off - it takes probably 15 minutes to brew coffee, which is obviously not the way it's supposed to work. I'm checking with B&D to get their input."
5,Great Item - Cleans Easily,Cleaning a container like this is very important to me. It is very well put together and easy to keep clean and fresh for future use. It will make a wonderful gift for someone special or even for your own home.
1,Less than 4 months old and now broken,"I've had it less than 4 months. Very light use, now it doesn't work. I hope the company will contact me for an exchange for another one. If not, I would not recommend to purchase this item unless you want a throwaway item."
4,coffee in a flash,"After getting tired of the ""pod' system for a quick cup of cofee for one, I am delighted that I can use this product with whatever coffee I have on hand. The built in filter is a time saver. Love the product!!"
4,Liked it so bought another one!,"My sister gave me one of these as a gift a few years ago. I am the sole coffee-drinker in my house so it is a perfect size for me. I use it every morning. I use filtered water, grind whole coffee beans, and mix them with something called Teechino from the natural foods store. (I like the almond amaretto flavor best.) That way, I can brew the full, large mug and not get too much caffeine. Works for me. I use paper #2 Melitta filters, rather than the permanent filter, to eliminate the bitter oils, which are also supposedly bad for you.Anyway, I love this appliance, sometimes I even pack it in my suitcase on trips, and I just bought a new one because the old one is starting to sputter a bit after 1000 uses!Just a warning - ALL the tall drink mugs in this world, especially those with handles, are very ""tippy"" so don't have them where a spill would be a disaster (near paperwork, homework, computer, small kids, silk dress,etc!)"
1,Disappointed,"I was looking for a small coffee maker that would be easy to use and quick to clean. Thought this was it, but have to say I am disappointed. For starters, the coffee grounds splash up onto the underside of the lid, so the it's necessary to unplug the maker and take it to the sink to rinse off. I've tried several brands of coffee and none of them come out tasting very good.Also, the mug fell apart, with the outer sleeve separating from the inner cup."
4,Personal Brew and Go,"It is a little bigger than I was expecting, but a good value for the coffeemaker and travel mug. Brews quickly, and looks like it will travel well."
1,dont buy it.,"the grounds from the coffee spill over into the rest of the unit from the filter. its a design flaw. plus i had the cup getting water into it and its hard to take it out.(its getting water between the steel and the plastic area. should have been securely insulated)long story short, dont buy it. I am not going to believe the overall review ranking on amazon from now on because i dont think any rational person who actually used this product would give it a 5 star review."
1,Cheap Junk!,It never worked right.Always left 10%-25% of water in the tank without brewing it into the cup.Small opening to pour water into always leaves a spill on the counter top.Stopped working after 1 1/2 months of twice daily usage.Save your money and buy a different brand.Sold by Westview Traders Inc.
1,If you like the taste of plastic....,"I got this a short time ago and ran water through it once to clean it. Then I used it to make tea:1) filling it was difficult. The angle was bad to get the water in the retention container. It splashed everywhere and made a mess to be cleaned up2) the tea tasted STRONGLY of plastic. Had to toss the tea. GROSS3) I like to make big cups of tea, about 15 oz mug. I used my mug, which was fine, but the holding tank for the water won't hold that much water. I had to refill it with more splashing.I'll try it again and update if things change. VERY disappointed."
1,Stopped working after 2 months.,"I have been using this only once or twice a week, and now the coffee maker shuts off after spewing a few drops of water. The return window expired - so I will see how the warranty works out, but I don't advice this for anyone."
2,Died after 2 months!,"I purchased this product towards the end of December. I absolutely loved the coffee maker. I used it probably 4 times a week until the end of February it just died. It will not turn on. Very disappointed, but I guess that is what I get for getting a cheap coffee maker."
2,made cheap not so good design,"Don't expect surprise - you get what you paid for. I can't find any good on this. It's worth as a mug - maybe 5 dollars?Will spend more bucks to get 'real coffee maker'. The quality is same as free machine - e.g., Gevalier's."
5,great coffee,"This is an excellent one cup coffeemaker. One key to good coffee is heat and this product brews hot. The mug (included) keeps it hot for a long time. You can't beat this price, especially when compared to the other one-cup coffee makers out there which are over $100!! Others noted problems with spillover and this is not an issue if you use the mug itself to fill."
2,Looking for the right Mr Coffee,"I loved this little coffee maker. It fit perfectly on my counter top and produced a great cup of coffee with minimal fuss. It was so disappointing one morning to push the button and see nothing happen. I must say that the return process was outstanding though. Print up a label, adhere it to a package and set it out with the rest of the mail. I have since found the right Mr. Coffee, a 4-cup maker, and we are very happy together."
3,Would not spend the money again,This coffee maker does not get the coffee hot enough. The filter allows the fine grounds through. It is fast and the cup is really nice but I wouldn't buy it again.
3,Doesn't quite deliver.,"I love the IDEA of this product as I'm the only one in the house that drinks coffee and only usually have one cup at a time. The unit is small and the mug attractive. However, I've used this three times now, and ALL three times, the grounds from the coffee spill over into the rest of the unit from the filter. I'm using the recommended amount and yet the filter seems to be too small or not working properly.It also doesn't work as fast as I would think for a product called ""Brew N Go"". It seems like it is done, but then if you take the travel mug away, it keeps dripping ... all over your counter.. for a few minutes.The hassle of cleaning up grounds from everywhere is starting to outweight the benefit of having fresh coffee at home."
3,"Great coffee maker, horrible travel mug","The coffee maker works great, makes a great cup of coffee. Unfortunately, if you use the included mug, your coffee will taste like plastic and be full of BPA."
2,Great....for a little while!,"Loved this idea of a small, one cupper into a travel mug. You can make a cup right into any mug, actually. However, after only a few months of use it has started to leak quite a bit. I now have to set the coffee maker on a kitchen towel to sop up all the water that drains out of the base of the unit. It's still working otherwise, but what a mess!"
3,Brew and go,"The concept is great. This product makes good coffee and automatically turns off, which makes it safer. The main problem is that the supplied coffee filter needs a top to prevent the expanded, water soaked, coffee grinds from flowing over the filter basket into the brewed coffee itself. I solved this problem by spooning the coffee into a ""fold over"" paper filter. This works and saves a big mess. Now the coffee is grind-free and the pot is easy to clean."
4,Just what I wanted,"This coffee maker is perfect as brew and drink. The element isn't heated so it does not keep. I would recommend it for that. Great price, good coffee."
3,I could take it or leave it,"The travel mug is a piece of junk, but the cup at a time design of the base is great. You can use any cup you want, up to 16 oz. Worth it for the price."
2,plastic taste,"I thought I would like this coffee maker for just one cup in the morning, but the mug give the coffee a plastic taste. Now I use it to brew and transfer the coffee into a glass mug. I am going to go back to my glass carafe 12-cup coffee maker even though it takes up more space on the counter."
2,barely worth $15,"I thought this would be a simple way to make one cup of coffee but I'm back to my old 5yr old maker. This is extremely messy and with no shut off, you can get coffee all over. I like strong coffee and when you put alot of coffee in the filter, it clogs up. Cleaning the reusable filter is very messy as I guess all these are. I would send this back but I'll save it for emergency use. Really, the only good thing about this product is the thermal mug."
2,Adequate but unimpressive,"I got this for my office to replace an old, small Melitta I had for a long time. This unit just doesn't compare. Everything about it feels cheap. It's made out of lots of thin, cheap plastic. Closing the lid, you never know if it's quite shut because the whole thing is flexible, not sturdy. It uses a non-standard filter to hold the coffee, so disposable filters are not an option. The area for the cup is about 1/4 inch too short for my favorite mug, so I have to use the one that came with the unit, which has -- you guessed it -- a cheap, flimsy feel to it.It brews fine coffee, so I'm not going to return it. But when this one breaks, if not sooner, I'll look for something nicer."
5,Perfect for a single,"This is the perfect coffee maker for a single person. It brews 15 ounces in less than 2 minutes and comes with a nifty thermos-type cup with a sip lid. I put the plastic filter aside and use No. 1 Melita filters which fit like a glove, so there are no messy wet grounds to deal with. It makes a cup of coffee just about as quickly as the $100 single cup makers and I am saving money by buying ground coffee in a bag rather than those expensive single cup packages."
4,Works well,"This coffee maker makes good coffee, and it's nice to be able to still buy one that isn't a Keurig or other kind of single serve coffeemaker - I just wanted a simple, travel mug coffeemaker. It has a built in filter, which is nice so I don't have to buy filters anymore.One thing - the only travel mug of mine that will fit is the one that came with it. It's shorter than most, so just be aware that you will always have to use this travel mug - no biggie, but I would like to be able to use another, if this one is in the wash, etc.Also, the coffee grounds have a tendency to get stuck to the top of the brewing compartment, instead of all staying in the filter, which just requires some extra cleanup, but it's sort of annoying from time to time.Can't beat the price for this simple coffeemaker that just does what it's supposed to!j"
3,Black & Decker Brew 'n Go,"The Brew 'n Go has a compact footprint and brews quickly. However, I found the unit a bit cumbersome to clean. The mesh filter, its housing and the water holes all get coffee particles in them. If you are patient and don't mind the tedious cleaning, it is not a bad coffee maker."
5,one cup at a time,This is awesome. I can have a cup anytime without making a full pot. Highly recommended for anyone. And the price was right.
2,"Great Idea, utter disappointment","I really wanted this to be a good coffee maker. Ive used it for 2 months now but i cannot solve any of the problems with it.1. the coffee takes pretty bad. its got a rubbery tangy taste. i figured it was plastic oils post manufacturing but it isnt. ive cleaned it countless times. ran soap water, vinegar, used paper filters, different mugs, tried using too much coffee but nothing would get the taste out.2. its terribly loud. try using this in a dorm room and youll wake up your roommate with all the unnecessary noise this thing makes.i liked the idea of it and maybe mine was just a lemon but i tossed this in the garbage it was a terrible disappointment."
1,Do Not Buy,"My old Starbucks coffeemaker, which I had for 5 years, stopped working last week. I always thought it was too much for what I needed (it was a gift) so I made the conscious decision to go downmarket when I bought a new one. Big mistake. I saw the negative reviews on this coffemaker, but figured if it made a cup of coffee, I'd be happy. Well, it couldn't even do that and I'm not happy. When I cleaned out the coffemaker with vinegar and water it worked fine. But, when I added coffee grinds, the thing backed up and got water all over my counter. I'm being 100% honest when I say there was more water on my counter than in the mug. Plus, the coffee grinds ended up in the water reservoir and all over my counter, to boot. I tried using this a few times, figuring maybe the mess was a one time thing. WRONG. The coffeemaker was delivered yesterday, and I already have it packaged for a return today. Honestly, don't waste your money or time. Spend a little more money for something that works."
4,Personal Coffeemaker,"This coffeemaker works great, and I highly recommend this item for the person on the go. It truly makes only one cup, so don't expect too much coffee in the morning."
5,Brew 'n Go,"This is my 3rd Brew 'n Go in 9 years. I use it every day, sometimes 2-3 times a day. I always have fresh coffee this way. I love the Brew 'n Go."
4,Does its job. Cost-effective,"After my workplace installed a horrible-tasting state-of-the-art coffee maker to replace a so-so old machine, I decided to brew for myself.This product is perfect for me to brew 2 full cups a day during my work hours. The included cup keeps coffee warm long enough and with good taste.The only caveats are that the internal lid is a bit difficult to clean and that the water tank collects condensate water at the end of a day so that I have to dump it. Otherwise, it's excellent with the reasonable price."
3,"Pretty Good, But Flawed","If you like strong coffee, this product probably will disappoint. If you try to put more than 2 1/2 TBSP of coffee in the basket, it will overflow into the cup and the rest of the coffee maker making a mess for cleanup. Also, it brews quick, but the last ounce or so drips for a few minutes after it shuts off. Good, but not great."
1,Stopped working after 2 uses,"This would have been a great product, but it stopped working after only 2 uses."
4,Black & Decker DCM18S Brew 'n Go,This coffeemaker works best with a #1 filter placed inside the original filter to minimize spattering of the grounds. This makes a very good cup of coffee.
2,Not very good,"I thought this was a good idea since it sounded convenient with a travel mug included and no filters to add. But I realized I would much rather have a paper filter instead of the basket/filter that comes in this product. My coffee mug always has sediment on the bottom when I finish the coffee. I also hate to hand wash dishes so I hate to hand wash the filter too. I would love to just take out the paper filter and put in a new one. I also realized that this coffee maker does not make hot coffee if I put cold water in it. I have to put luke warm water in it and then the coffee will be hot. It's just a cheap product, I'm going to buy the coffee maker that has paper filters and a 4 cup pot."
1,Black & Decker DCM18S Brew 'n Go Personal,"complete piece of garbage. i read reviews before i purchased and after i did. wish i had seen the negatives first. if it wasnt so ""cheap"" id do what id need for a refund. its a waste of time....ill toss it in the garbage. after about 2 weeks the brew cycle is incomplete. i had to turn it on about 4 times to complete it..by then your coffee is no longer hot! the cup is another piece of ****. the plastic rim that enables the top to fit in place...after you wash it water remains under lid...so when you drink (when there is little left)...you get water pouring down your chin. this thing is junk..maybe ill call black and decker. ill tell 'em what i think of their junk and get my moneyin short..dont buy this piece of **** item....."
2,Skip this coffee maker,Coffee grounds get into the coffee every time. It is hard to clean as the grounds get stuck to the top of the filter.
2,small white bumps,"I started using this product for about a month now. My skin feels very soft, but small white bumps started to appear since I used this product. I've never had this problem before. A few other people I know have the same problem...so becareful not to use it too long."
4,Great product in small container,"I have been using the Olay Regenerist Serum for years and LOVE it. While I always purchased the bigger containers (3.5oz) in the past, I now switched to the smaller ones (1.7oz). I will go back though because the pump works much better on the tall bottles and releases more creme. However, the product is the same."
5,Pleased Buyer,"I purchased this product because I was tired of my face feeling dry and wanted to touch up areas on my face My girlfriend and I both use this product together.The bottle lets out only a little bit of the serum at a time. This is great because the product spreads very well. A small bottle can actually last you quite a while if you do not go crazy with it.The serum has a very comforting scent and is very relaxing to put on your face. The liquid feels cool to the touch, and is not greasy. My face definitely feels more moisturized when I use this product over the Aveeno Lotion I used on it before."
4,most peptite rate in it,"I just bought it. I am using it nearly 1 week, I dont feel any dryness on my face. I had a search about it and there is a lot of peptite in it. &#305;ts price is very logical."
1,Good idea but piece of junk.,"This thing work great a few times, then I experienced that same problems that others have writen about. The blade attachment would come off, the battery would die to quickly, etc. It just stopped working after a very short time. Do not buy this product."
2,What a Pain!,"Okay, I have to first defend B&D; products by saying that this is the first one I've ever actually had trouble with, but boy when they flop, they flop!The charge life is good, but the charger itself is a pain to get the can opener in and out of. The blade assembly comes off, which was a good thought for cleaning but terrible when it flies off the can opener while you're using it. The magnet isn't strong enough to grab the lid, so you're fishing it out of the soup when it falls in. Mine finally just stopped completely opening cans after 7 months and I threw it in the trash. I think they had a good idea with the ""walking around the can"" thing- that does come in handy when opening extra large cans- however, the design needs some work."
2,Needs a new design!,"I've owned a B&D cordless can opener for years, and use my opener all the time. So when it came time for a new one I got B&D. What a mistake. . .I'm sure that B&D designed it without a handle to avoid it from knocking things off the counter. However, for me It's hard to get out of the charger, is not easy to put back in the charger, which means it often is not charging when it should be. It's too big to work with one hand, and too compact for two. I appreciate a company that continues to try and improve their product. But B&D needs to send this one back to the drawing board."
2,black and decker must be associated with GE...!,"I have had no luck with black and decker or GE..I think the ones who make these products could care less how they turn out, just as long as they get there pay checks..that is why these things that are created are not worth the price or headache...."
5,Amazing Gizmo Opener,"I have had this product for 2 years now. My sister had hers for 4 years. When my last can opener went, she recommended this to me. I would now recommend it to anyone. I even went out and got one for my aunt. I have read reviews about this product that say it is very hard to get onto the can. Once you use it a few times and realize how you should put the opener on the can, you no longer feel like there was ever a problem. I LOVE IT and recommend it to anyone"
1,Plastic parts don't hold up/no replacements,"My Gizmo was a gift to replace a 10 year old B&D under-the-counter model I couldn't get a part for. It looks neat and goes around a can quickly, but has lots of problems in design. It was difficult to detach or attach to the base without both hands and would tip over small cans when it was used off the base. Within 4 months, the black plastic bracket that holds the blade assembly in place cracked when I took the assemble off to clean it. Super-glue repaired it, but then the thin plastic strip holding the magnetic lid holder in place (on the blade assembly) broke when the arm swung too far while taking a can off. The lid hadn't completely cut and stayed on the can. The plastic parts are too fragile for a family's use and replacement parts aren't available. After just 9 months use, the unit is crap. B&D is taking too many short cuts with products now."
2,Replacement Batteries not Available,"This was a great can opener when new, but it has a short service life since the batteries are not available when it comes time to replace them. Ours lasted less that two years."
1,Back to the Crank,"This can opener lost its charge after the first few uses, and now it won't recharge at all. No matter how long it's in the charger. I went back to my hand-crank model and the Gizmo went into the trash."
3,Interesting beta device,"Interesting device but it falls short of its claims. First off, the cradle charging unit is poorly designed to accomodate the can opener itself. This makes it a real pain to attach the can opener to the charger -- and you will need to do so! Battery life is rather poor. My unit totally discharges after just 5-7 cans over a period of 3 weeks. That's just unacceptable in my opinion, but if we're forced to live with this, then they could have made the charging cradle better! To top it off, this unit uses a sealed non replaceable battery, so after a few years you'll have to junk it! Finally, the can opener itself is tricky to use. It's unlike a traditional opener, so it takes some getting used to. Overall, this sucker needs some serious new R&D invested into it. B&D should be ashamed of itself for letting out a design that is clearly still in beta stages!"
1,Disappointed Consumer,"The Gizmo can opener is handy to use when working in different areas of the kitchen. However, it difficult and fustrating to use because it comes apart too easily. Also, it is next to impossible to use if the person has problems with their hands. The life of the can opener is short lived. I have owned my opener for just over a year and I now have to replace it. I do not recommend."
1,To good to be true!,"I saw this gadget can openner and thought wow that is realy neat. That would make opening big and small cans easy. It was great at first then I started to have problems with it. It was not holding a great charch or the cans opener was to dull. Also, on smaller cans I needed to be careful to watch that it does not fall over because of the can not being so heavy and the gadget being a little weighty. Maybe they will make some improvements. I hope it was a great idea."
5,I loveeeee it,I have been using Gizmo for two months and didn't see anything wrong. I really don't understand why people have such a bad experience with this simple wonderful opener. It is easy to use and it's cute. Just charge and fully recharge everytime do nothing after that. Even watching that small thing while it is working is fun. Don't listen other people complain just go with it.5 out of 5.
3,A fool proof can opener,Other than the clumsy way it is packed in its stand this opener performs its assigned task well. Too bad the designing engineers just didn't make a stand that was part of the overall machine.
1,Worst $25 I ever spent,"It took me three weeks to figure out that the can opener has to be positioned just right to get it to cut into the can lid. It worked for about three cans and then it started to give me problems again. It runs out of steam half way around the can. When I take it off and press the arm down it whirs away happily, but put it on a can and it sounds like its going to sleep. I can't figure out way it won't work for me. I'm sorry I thought it was such a nifty looking opener and spent my money on it."
4,Gizmo use,Works well but recommendation to run it dead before charging makes the last opening of tuna fish cans very slow.
1,gizmos don't last long,I was very fortunate to be able to return my first Gizmo because the battery would not hold a charge. THe store very nicely gave me another and after a few months it too will not hold a charge. Went back to the store but without the box (they kept the first one to return it in) they told me I was out of luck. I think I will return to using the old fashioned hand held holder as long as I can.
1,Lasted Only 1 Year,Got this coffee maker as a gift. After about 6 months the burner became corroded and impossible to clean. Then it completely stopped working after 12 months. I know these don't last forever but I expected a lot longer that 1 year. I'm not happy with the quality and would not buy this coffee maker for myself.
4,a good deal,Whats to say the price was right amazons service was excelent and my grand kids play with it. I would buy another one.
1,getting stuck with wrong parts,you use there parts checker to see if its right and then they say its your problem when its wrong
4,Different and really funny.,"We don't see many animes with a perverted female main character. Yamada is starting high school with a lofty goal. She's gonna bang 100 dudes before she graduates. She finds her first target at a bookstore when she's goofing off. She decides that Kosuda is gonna be her 1st on the long journey to 100. When she makes her move she botches it and makes a fool of herself. From then on it becomes harder and harder for her to get close enough to Kosuda to seal the deal. After numerous attempts and failures Yamada and Kosuda develop feelings for each other. So much for banging 100 dudes. There's only 1 for her.This anime is really funny. Yamada is a hilarious character, and Kosuda is a genuine nice guy that you just have to root for.There are tons of laughs and a lot of nearly romantic moments. The end of this anime is very good too. All the hoping and wanting you had is satisfied. All in all this is a fun and light hearted show worth watching."
3,Decent product but disappointing,"The device is easy to hook up but I was disappointed in its limitations. I bought 2 of these devices to get an extra receiver for the purpose of transmitting the signal from my laptop to 2 different stereos(pricewise, it was cheaper to buy 2 sets rather than just buying a receiver by itself $49 vs $79). From the way the paperwork reads, it states that you can add several different receivers, up to 16 receivers. However, you can only send the signal to one receiver at time. My hope was to be able to wirelessly send the same music throughout my entire home and play it through 2 stereos at the same time. As long as you only want to play your music through one stereo, this is great product. But if you want to wirelessly play your music on two or more receivers at the same time, you're out of luck with this device. Without this limitation, I would give it 5 stars."
2,Great till it quit working,"Logitech's Wireless Music System was easy to set up (granted you've used your USB port on your computer before, and plugged inputs into the back of your receiver/stereo before).Bought it for my parents, because my mom is always frustrated with the interference she gets with her favorite classical radio stations.Their PC, running XP, had no hesitation accepting the little device, I just plugged it in and after a restart, it was broadcasting their computer's sounds. The receiver device was easy as well.Took me a moment to coordinate the volume control on the computer with the volume control on the Logitech receiver and the volume control on their stereo -- so there wouldn't be a dramatic volume change switching from the Logitech input to others.Mom was thrilled.Then it just quit. The little USB device just didn't power up. No issue with the computer.Drag.Buy something that perhaps costs more but sold by a company with a better reliability track record than Logitech."
3,Not very good,"I am not a big fan. The spray is not very even, with a few that shoot out a good 6 inches further than the rest. I am still currently using it but will change it out as soon as I find something I know will work as advertised. I guess for the price it isn't half bad, I just wouldn't recommend it based off of my experience."
2,Seems a little disjointed,"I purchased this book because it received so many positive reviews, and appeared to cross the bridge between a novice user and a power user. I clearly am a novice user in Access, although I am a power user in Excel. However, Excel won't work for the application I want to develop.This book seems a little disjointed, in that it touches on things at the beginning and tells you that it will cover them in detail much later in the book. However, the items that it pushes towards the back of the book appear to me to be core skills and knowledge. I am beginning to feel that I need to read the entire book before I start working on building my database rather than building it in stages while reading the book.I am also finding that key functions are missing completely from the index (and I cannot find them by looking through the book).I'm a little disappointed in this book."
1,Does not work!,The unit I bought does not cut. It just slides around on the pipe and leaves a faint metal mark. There is no abrasive as I would expect.
1,Highly dissatisfied!!!,I am very disappointed with this product. The wire cuts all around and the cup is made cheaply.This undergarment does not fit well at all and the quality is very poor.
5,front close wonderwire,Wife loves it. Fit is great and comfortable wearing all day long. I can say she really looks good in it.
2,Scratchy and stiff,"The bra was slightly too big which would have been ok, but it was also very scratchy and stiff. Much too uncomfortable to wear. I returned it."
2,uncomfortable and expensive bra,This is a very uncomfortable bra. As the rest of the reviews indicate (those I did not trust when I decided to buy them anyway). If you are big do not buy these bras
1,Disappointed...,I was really disappointed in this bra. It had such great reviews that I was compelled to purchase. I am always looking for front clasp bras- hard to find in larger sizes. Here in lies the issue. The clasp is positioned very low on the cup - so there is a good two plus inches of underwire above it. So when you slouch or sit - it pops forward. This totally shows through your shirt! If the clasp were positioned more in the middle between the cups I dont think this would happen. Bummer...
5,Easy Comfort,"Ever since Warners stopped making their front closure bra I had been looking for a replacement. I am happy with the Glamorise Women's Front Closure Bra#9245. It fits well and for me was true to size. While other makers offer something similar I did not want a razor back strap. For women my age this is an easy bra to put on, wear and comfortable. I would recommend it to those women who like front closure bras."
3,As advertised but must have been a hard ride,Product as advertised and works well in DeWalt nailer. Must have been a rough ride as almost every clip of nails had a number of nails broken off the clip. Not worth returning but will likely look locally in the future.
1,And Then Came Lola,"I must say, this is one of the worst films I have ever seen.The worst part about it, is you have to watch the same boring plot line over and over again.And Then Came LolaI rate this - Do Not Watch"
1,Poor Plot.,The plot was stupid for me. It was similar to Ground Hog Day. It repeated itself over and over. It was boring
1,tedious and stupid,"This is probably the most boring, stupid film that I can remember seeing. It is repetitive, MTV-style, disjointed and a complete waste of time and money. The trailer tries to imply that it is sexy (not) and insightful (not). What more can I say?"
4,A fun lighthearted lesbian remake of Run Lola Run focused on relationships rather than crime,"I am biased in favor of this movie to begin with because (being from San Francisco originally) I really loved the San Francisco setting for the movie and the feel of the movie. The shot in one of the scenes of Lola in Delores Park on 16th and Delores, one of my favorite places in the world, being an example of that.Personally while I enjoyed the pulsing soundtrack of the German film Run Lola Run I found this relationship and social circle centric remake more than the crime and violence centric Run Lola Run. I also like the open homage this film paid to Run Lola Run in ways such as using comic character sequences illustrating the running scenes.I'd put in the fun light hearted romantic comedy genre of appeal to those in the artistic, LGBT, or 20's 30's dating scene rather than bridge and tunnel set or less urban viewers."
1,It's really bad,I'm glad I was at work when I watched this movie. It's absolutely terrible. The acting is bad and the story line generally sucks. Glad it was free and I had nothing better to do. Don't waste your time on this one.
5,Great Bino's!!!!,These are a great value! Excellent optics and great in low light. As a hunter I use them a lot in low light situations. Would highly recommend
3,This is loud,"This fan moves air very well. This unit is also very loud. It was louder than tri-cool 120mm and 92mm blue fans. I ended up removing power from the unit because it was louder than the other 5 fans in my case combined. If you NEED cooling then this will help to get front to rear airflow added to your case. If you have other case options then I suggest using them first.For graphic card overheating issues you should add internal fans in the case to move the hot air away from the graphic card.This can be done by adding a fan to push extra air across the cooling fans of the graphic card. Using the ""pull"" system of this rear exhaust fan to take away hot air from the card is very inefficient. First task is to cool the card then the second task is to remove the hot air. This fan will remove the hot air from the case. Try using a dual 70mm card slot fan or a fan pointed at the graphics card to push air into your graphic card. I used the vantec card for that purpose."
5,Black & DEcker Cordless Can Opener,"This is my second can opener of this type ~ which I'd had for a long time. When I went to buy another can opener I wanted it to be the very same one. It works so well and is so handy. As far as I'm concerned, no can opener is better"
4,Black & Decker KEC600 Cordless Can Opener,"The can opener is a designed well, as I still have my original one. I did have to re-solder the battery wires after a few years as the opener slowed down & it worked just fine afterwards. These were purchased for our Family as they are so useful."
1,Forget this one,"If I could color the star black I would. I have to agree with John Row who wrote a review on this thing. I wish I had read it before purchasing it. It is VERY hard to get the blade to line up with the can lid. When you finally get it going it moves so slowly and laborously that there is doubt that it will finish the job. Totally forget using it on a coffee can, or any can lager than the standard 14oz can, because it won't even begin to open it. Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage. I can't say one good this about it."
1,Useless ...,"If I hadn't thrown the box away I would have returned this ... It has never opened one can. Of any size. It gets stuck and whines and burns up the batteries. It won't open ANY can not even ""regular"" ones. I don't know why every one else is so thrilled with it. NOT EVEN ONE STAR!!"
1,Would not recommend,"I wasn't happy with this can opener. It worked fairly well for the first month I had it, then it wouldn't hold a charge and took too long to open a can because it was so weak. The rest of my review is basically a ditto of K. tate's."
1,Didn't Last Very Long,"We bought one a few months ago and it seems to be slowly dying already and won't hold a charge. I already have to replace it. Most of the other can openers we have bought in the past lasted for years, not just a few months."
5,Best Can Opener,"I had bought one for myself a few years back and have loved it and still do. My mother was having a hard time using can openers so i figured i would buy her one for her birthday. Well I think everyone else was buying them at the same time, it took me three months for me to find one. She loves it and can't believe how easy it is to use, and loves that it goes around the can by itself. I highly recommend this item. Great buy."
4,So far so good,"We bought this to replace our ""Gizmo"" can opener when the battery finally stopped accepting charges (After 4 years).We didn't want an under-the-counter unit, so we decided to give this one a try. So far it is at least as good as the Gizmo was, but even seems easier to get lined up on the can.We can only hope for the money that it lasts 4+ years as well."
5,A GREAT addition to any kitchen?,"My wife liked this so well that I got her a second one as a backup.This is a no-hands version and is much quicker to use, and quicker to clean up."
2,Liked it but it broke,"I liked the can opener, even though a charge wouldn't open more than a couple of cans in a row. But the other day, it fell apart. I didn't use it that often, so I was pretty disappointed that it broke after lightweight usage. Also, the cutting head fell off quite a bit and that was aggrevating. I did like it, just wish it hadn't fallen apart so easily."
2,"Looks good, but...","Ok,Maybe I'm just unlucky, But after 8 months, mine died. I don't have access the unit's failure rate, so perhaps this is just an anomaly, but I'm skeptical. I really didn't work it too much, in fact, due to an illness, it probably hasn't been fired up more than about 30 times.If I hadn't paid a grand for it, I could just shrug it off, but in fact, for around the same money, one can purchase an upscale Kitchen Aid mixer, and a professional (built for bars and clubs) blender, and still walk away ahead. In fact, I own a 18 year old K5 Kitchen Aid...that still makes bread and whips better egg-whites than this unit ever did. My 5 year old industrial blender BTW, still makes morning smoothies with out breaking a sweat.Sure, the best thing about this unit is it's looks, but for actual cooking, save your money and get some real tools, now...to find the box and receipt, and hold my breath...."
5,My first nail gun.,"Saw this on a lighting deal for 20.00. I didnt even need a nail gun at the time, but bought it just cause it seemed like a good deal and I didnt own any nail guns at the time. I'm always buying tools when I see them for a good deal, cause I know someday I'll need them. Needless to say I had to do some trim work on two doors and a closet. For the price I am very happy with it. It shoots even the two inch brads into wood with no problem. Very handy for even bigger jobs. I have used to to just ""tack"" the lumber together then I come back with screw gun. For the ocassional use home owner its great, would buy one again. Now if I can just find a finish nailer for 20.00."
4,No directions for Wen,I like the tool but was disappointed that there were no insructions or parts list with this tool.I would expect some instructions and adress to contact if tool fails.
2,Prone to jamming,Used it a couple of days after receipt and it just jammed so many times. I was attracted to it by the low cost but I guess you get what you pay for. Not liking it at this point.
2,"OK introduction, but not much content","I found this book too introductory and lacking in useful content. If you have not read very much about ADHD, it might be an eye-opening read and you might find comfort in the ""Wow, my partner does exactly that!"" moments reading about the author's experiences. But for more in-depth and much more detailed content, I would recommend A. D. D. and Romance: : Finding Fulfillment in Love, Sex, & Relationships. It had more solid information based on clinical experiences with many patients rather than just an anecdotal description from one person's perspective."
4,Bathtime fun,"My son is almost 2 1/2 and has had this toy for 6 months. He doesn't quite understand how to work it, but he thinks it's hilarious when mom and dad make the pitch go up and down. He does enjoy filling it up with water and pouring it out. I am hoping he will understand it better and enjoy it more when he is a little older."
3,Messy and noisy................but it definately works,"Just like other reviews had point out, this burr mill works pretty good but it's EXXTREMELY messy and loud. It crushes the beans and grinds into pretty even granules. However the sqare hole where the grinded coffee comes out is very short and does not seal tightly. Together with the static, some coffee powder will be flying everywhere after you grind it. If you try to open the cover, more powder fly out. I found two ways to prevent the mess. 1.Make sure that the collector cup is attached as tight and position as correctly as possible. 2.Pad the cup a few times before removing the cup. I think it neutrolize some of the static and bring more powder to the bottom.Bottom line: This burr mill is cheaper than most of the others and works pretty well, if you don't mind the mess and the noise."
1,Cheaply made junk.,"This thing makes a real mess, and the plastic teeth that hold the hopper broke the first week I had it. This is poorly designed and useless. Don't waste your money. One smart thing they did was to include a long handled scoop that has two separate functions, one side to measure and one with which to clean."
3,Not for Wii,I boght this to connect my Wii to a wired internet connection. The Wii does not recognize it (I later learned from the Nintendo web site that Wii will only recognize a proprietary connector. Once I bought that from Nintendo for 3 times the price of this it worked fine.)
5,New life to an old computer,"Nowadays if a computer can't hook up to the internet then it's worthless. I abandoned my wireless network for a more secure ethernet home network. I acquired an old computer that didn't have a working ethernet port. I already have several other computers, and so I didn't want to spend a lot of money to get this hooked up to the internet.This adapter was PERFECT!!! Easy to install on an 8 year old computer, and I was on the internet like a flash.I don't think it's as fast as a dedicated ethernet connection to the motherboard, but even with USB version 1 my connection speeds are fast enough that I can watch Youtube and download small files without really noticing the difference. Unless you're seriously into downloading gigantic files, this is a good gadget to breath new life into an old computer without spending a lot.I could have just bought a new USB 2.0 pci card for faster service, but I didn't want to spend that much on this old computer."
4,TRENDnet USB to 10/100Mbps Adapter,"A wonderful product (TRENDnet USB to 10/100Mbps Adapter) which we are using daily. Had some problem receiving this product because we only have postal delivery to our PO Box. Only UPS delivers to our street address.Amazon had me re-submit this order with priority mail and then it was delivered to my PO Box.This is a constant problem with several of Amazon suppliers. If we put my street address down as 3507 Dwight Street, Penney Farms, Fl 32079, they change the address and it goes to Green Cove Springs, FL 32043. They send it back as no such address.I have discussed this numerous times with the Penney Farms Post Master who has discuss this with the Post Master at Green Cove Spring. So far no one has been able to resolve this issue.Paulpwelch109@bellsouth.net"
5,Great product and works on Linux :),"This is a great USB ethernet adapter, it installs automatically on Windows XP, needed no additional configuration, unless you use a static IP address.What made this adapter great was its Linux compatibility, I wasn't expecting much as Trendnet doesn't list linux drivers on their support site. But, it worked out of the box with Ubuntu Linux (Feisty 7.04). Again, all I needed to do was setup the static IP and restart the OS and it worked :) Couldn't ask for more."
4,Neat gadget,"I have a flat screen tv mounted on the wall, and all supporting components in a hutch on the other side of the wall. The Hidden IR takes the signal from any of my remotes and rebroadcasts the signal ""through"" the wall.I thought the cables were a little short, but I was able to extend the distance using a couple standard RCA adaptors and coaxial cable (shielded cable). This option is not listed in the manual, but it has worked well for me. Also, you have to point the remote pretty focused on the IR receiver port to get the signal through.The product comes with an LED light that confirms the signal was received, and rebroadcast. I am only using four of the eight rebroadcast emitters, and it works great."
2,Very Disappointed !,We've only used the grinder a few times. The first couple of times it smoked. I figured it was just some manufacturing oils burning off. It finally stopped smoking and also stopped working! It worked good but unfortunately that wasn't very long!
2,Like you need another irritant in the morning?,"I purchased this grinder to replace a Krups blade grinder that had finally stopped working after many years of service. Reading several other reviews that complained of the mess this thing makes should have prepared me for the daily explosion of ground coffee across my counter caused by the static buildup of the unit. Also, if you like dark oily coffee beans from Peets, Starbucks or Illy, you'll find yourself constantly patting the top of the machine to keep the beans flowing down to the grinding mechanism. I look foolish enough first thing in the morning, I certainly don't need the help of a crummy coffee grinder to make matters worse. Spend a few extra $ for a better burr grinder or stick with your old blade grinder."
4,This grinder is effective,"I bought the B&D burr grinder after reading in the ""Joy of Cooking"" all the reasons to use a burr grinder over a blade grinder. I am very pleased with this burr grinder. The coffee that results is VERY aromatic & delicious! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the messiness (it's a touch messier than the blade grinder due to the 'static' problem)...but the grinds aren't possessed (i.e. ""jumping up my arm"") as indicated by a prior reviewer -- the grinds just have a tendency to stick to the sides and lid of the cup. I have had this grinder for about 5 months and have had no problems. I am very happy with the product. For the price, you can't beat it."
2,danger,"ordered this without looking at any of the customer reviews, and what a mistake. The blender seemed to arrive alright, but I realized the product had already been recalled by the time it arrived. Why does amazon ship products that should be left for dead?why wasn't I informed? upon trying to blend some yogurt and berries it started to turn black at the bottom and smell very strange. Apparently this motor burning is a fire hazard. I hope my review will help shopper keep from wasting money on this item, and maybe Amazon will update its recall lists faster to avoid sending zombie products. Some can be dangerous!If I could give zero stars I would! No quality control anymore, none."
2,Not worth it..... Piece of junk.,"I have this blender over two years now and it won't take heavy loads. My other Hamilton B. blender is cheaper yet gets everything done in seconds. Where as I have to be extra careful while using B&D.;Recently, my blade broke and I am trying to look for a replacement. But it seems like manufacteres themself don't sell the parts, so will try to find elsewhere.Few of the reviews said, the parts are very expensive, so I guess I would just not look around instead trash this blender and buy another from different company."
4,Dorman Bush Hat,"There is a little more of a cowboy wannabee look about it than in the photo, but the band has a gold kangaroo,which must make it a bush hat. Otherwise, for the price it's an awesome hat. Glad I ordered large, though."
5,Great Movie,"I love this movie! Even being an ABC Family movie, this is great. its comical and light which I love."
1,Caveat Emptor,I previously purchased this pen from Amazon. It felt very substantial and hefty in your hand. It was a work of art. I just purchased this same pen last month and returned it. It felt cheap and light. I think it was a knock off. I returned it right away.
5,FRIGHTENING,"THE ONLY TIME THAT I COULD PUT THIS BOOK DOWN WAS WHEN I HAD TO TAKE A BREAK FROM THE HORROR OF ART PEPPER'S LIFE. WHAT WAS THE MOST AMAZING THING WAS THAT HE HAD TO TAKE DRUGS UP UNTIL HIS DEATH, EVEN AFTER ALL HE HAD BEEN THROUGH. THE HONESTY IN THE TELLING OF THIS LIFE WAS BRUTAL AND BEAUTIFUL AT THE SAME TIME. AFTER READING THIS BOOK, I THEN VIEWED THE DVD, NOTES FROM A JAZZ SURVIVOR. TO SEE HIM AND LISTEN TO HIS MUSIC AFTER READING HIS WORDS BROUGHT IT ALL TOGETHER. WAS IT ALL WORTH IT TO HIM? I THINK IT WAS,TO HIM, AND THAT HE WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING."
4,Really Good Book!,"When I opened this book, I was honestly not impressed because the essays were pulled straight from the CalBar website including the model answers which meant that the model answers were not 100% correct. However, I also noticed that BarBri added their own outline per question so you know what issues to bring up, and you can compare that to the model answer. There are about 4-5 essays per topicOf course it's not perfect as one could argue/bring up so many things, but this is the book to have during and after law school! It's cheap, convenient, and will help you during challenging times. This is the book to have!(Note: This book does not have essays regarding Agency, Partnership, & LLCs as these topics were added later on)"
3,Feels good - but the scent?,"This product does feel great on your skin. However, I really enjoy perfumed shower gels etc and didn't like the smell of this. Not pretty or perfumy at all - gave it away."
1,smoking but not in a good way...,"I've had this for a couple of years and only used it to slice turkey, chicken and roast beef. The first time I used the knife it started to smell like it was over heating. It does that every time I have used it. I've tried going very slow and applying no pressure to see if that would help - it helped a little but still seemed to be over heating. Cannot recommed it."
1,Not Relaxing,"My masseuse recently played this CD, knowing that I sometimes like things a ""little out there"". However this is way beyond a little out there and is no way relaxing. I can only imagine that this is what a bad LSD trip is like! Now I'm a big believer in ""If you don't like it, don't listen to it"", but if I had spent good money on this based on it being produced by ""The Relaxation Company"", I would be very upset."
5,Bravo!!,"I will admit when I went looking for a toaster it was dumb luck that I found this one. I had no idea what a difference it would make in my kitchen. My other toaster heated so unevenly I was just used to it. This toaster heats evenly and is sturdy enough to handle the little people in my house playing with it as I prepare breakfast. A great buy, you wont be disappointed!"
4,Great mixer!,"I've been looking for a mixer for a couple of years and found this Bosch. I've looked at [other mixers]...The Bosch is large enough for a double batch of cookies. It mixes well. It's fairly easy to add eggs, flour, etc to the bowl. It's not very heavy and has suction cups to hold it to the counter. And the price is comparable to the KitchenAid mixer.I gave it 4 stars because when I lift the head and batter is stuck to the beater, the beater comes loose. It's not really a problem, but it is an irritant.Don't be afraid to buy this mixer...it's fun to use!"
4,I loved the book because it gave a lot of deteal.,I liked the book because it let you see from the wolfs point of view. I also liked the book because it told you every little deteal there was. I liked the drawings to because the ilastrater used lots of color. The athar Dave Sargen is cool because he tells real stories.
4,Why has no one signed these guys?,"This disk has not left my CD changer since I bought it! 4 new songs, plus 3 live versions of songs from the album Do Unto Others and Split. Although lacking in new songs, the 4 that are present make up for it in pure aggression and energy. This is all about rock n' roll - no trend following, teen angst or fashion shows required!"
3,The act is old...,"Let's put it this way...""Mezmerize"" is clearly the superior Album of the two music wise. That said, this CD has it's up's, and down's, but mostly it's in the middle. It's not good, it's not bad.As for it's ""politics"" and lyrics? The problem I have with System, is that I have heard the same lyrics in half of their songs already. I know it's the ""cool thing to do"" to rip on the President and the war (no matter how much each side spins it) but the act is getting old...not only from this band, but every other one.Your entertainers...entertain me, don't lecture me. That goes for Republican entertainers, and Democratic entertainers."
5,Awesome unique sound!,"I have NEVER heard another group come close to capturing the sound that System can produce. Their songs have SO much energy, and more importantly, MEANING! I love them as much for the lyrics as the sound. I cannot stop listening! There was only one song on this album that I am not in love with (U-Fig), and I love Hypnotize and Lonely Day. All the other songs I would rate 8, 9, or 10 out of 10!"
3,Buy toxicity,"This album is not so great. there are a few songs which are great but the rest is not a good as their ather albums. i would reccamend you buy toxicity, it's a lot better all most all the songs are brilliant."
2,changing for the worse,"listen, this CD is good, music wise, but it isn't quite the classic old SOAD, that we all know is better, they have all gotten soft, no more screaming or roaring and having heavy headbanging angry riffs, no, just some form of odd, duett, slow, less metal, of wich they first came out as, the only thing that even resembles the old stuff is ATTACK, all the other songs are turn-off's for the headbanging type people, like me, good music (sometimes), but it's one of those CD's you want to get burned from your friend rather then buy, that was my mistake."
2,~The Downward Spiral~,"First off, It hurts to see SOAD slide in this direction. They are capable of creating a far better album. A lot of people are criticizing Daron's vocals(which I can completely understand). I think Daron is a great singer..in his place,which is singing harmony for Serj. Daron is not a front man, and they shouldn't let him attempt it. How did Rick Rubin,with his esteemed reputation, let some of this material out? Hopefully they can fall back to their original sound ie.SOAD or Toxicity."
1,If this was a side project maybe....,"I bought mezmerize and was somewhat dissapointed. The songs I liked I really liked but the majority of the album sucked. For some reason I thought this one might be better and I was wrong. If I didn't know better I would have thought they got a new lead singer, but of course I knew from the last album that annoying voice belongs to some other band member. Doing some back up vocals would be allrigt or maybe having one song in the spot light would be fine as well, but when I purchase music from a band I'm used to rocking out to and there is another voice ALL OVER the album I feel like I was tricked into buying someone elses CD. If you like system of a down this is not the album for you. This is SOAD's side project with Serj on backup vocals. The few songs he does sing in suck anyway. If I was SOAD I would quit before putting out any more crap like this with my name on it. If the other guy wants to sing that bad let him start his own band."
4,Pretty Good Album,"Attack-9/10 Fast paced song with great guitar beat. A great opening for the CD.Dreaming-6/10 no commentKill Rock 'N Roll-7/10 no commentHypnotize-9/10 Deserved to be on Mezmerize.Stealing Society-5.5/10 Too much Daron! and very repetetive.Tentative-7/10 Strange start but overall a good song.U-Fig-6.5/10 no commentHoly Mountains-7.5/10 Has a great beat that keeps you interested throughout the whole song, unlike Mind.Vicinity of Obscenity-7/10 A great start and a funny song, also gets stuck in your head quite easily. Beware.She's Like Heroin-7/10 A creative song, but again too much Daron!Lonely Day-6.5/10 A pretty depressing song. It sounds like Daron is descibing his life.Soldier Side-8.5/10 A good end to the disk."
1,Squidward does Klaszmer,"Yes, this is very fast and aggressive Klazsmer music sung by Squidward in his neo fascist anti Bush save the world stance. Ever thought that this would be cool? And where is SpongeBob and Patrick in all of this! Is G W Bush really like the evil Plankton or greedy like Mr. Crab? Maybe the next Squidward of a Down album will reveal all!!!"
2,"All filler, no Killer......","These guys are capable of much better. Although Darron can't sing, mesmerize was still a good album in my opinion. This album is just kind of there, it does not really grab you. I'm sure if I listened enough times there might be something that grabs me, but what a waste of time, as is with this album."
2,Stop trying to be different,"Soad over the years has been a great band...always been a bit different than others. but your already different no need to try and find something new stick with what you've built. I ONLY like 3 songs on hypnotize which is lonely day, hypnotize and soldier side. all the other song i could live without. mezmerize was an awesome album i listend to it for a month straight nothing else now im a bit tired of it but i still love it... hypnotize just falls so short of its predecessor"
5,Post War,"M.Ward and his friends have a standout record in ""Post War"". I my opinion the must own recording of the year."
3,not so useful in traveling with children.,"I had taken out the prior version of this book from the library and was pleased to see that there was a 2007 updated version to read. However, in the prior version there was much more specifically directed toward traveling with kids. In this version, most of that was eliminated, and I was bummed not to have that pointed out. While the color pictures are beautiful in the front of the book, more maps and more detail about traveling would have been more useful to me, rather than looking at fields of lavendar. I think a couple driving around for 3 weeks in Provence would have found it really useful. For our 1 week trip with three kids, I found I just didn't use the book very much.The information on internet cafes was very useful as was the entrance fee and time information to exhibits, etc."
3,Good set of speakers for the price.. but design is old,I have owned these speakers since Spring of 1998. And guess what.. the speakers died yesterday. I think that Over 10 years of reliable work speaks for itself. Although they don't deliver the best possible sound performance they were good product back in 1998 considering the fact there were not too many good quality active 2.1 speaker systems available for affordable price. Considering that the design is over 10 years old the price could be somewhat lower.
5,Medicated dog shampoo,So glad to be able to order this on line as it is so expensive at a vet's office. Great!!!
4,Best for dogs with skin issue,Works great. Got it for my Mastiff and it is the best. Keeps her skin issues completely under control. Expensive but worth it.
1,Malaseb medicated shampoo,"Had high hopes after reading reviews, but it did not work for my shih-tzu who has allergy issues. Still scratching and licking his underside after using it for a month. Disappointed...."
2,What a let down,"The talented group of musicians on the project makes me wonder what the heck happened? I'm crazy about Lande, and Magnus Karlsson is the new boy wonder in the guitar arena as far as I'm concerned. But rather than part two, I think its part re-do. The tone, and stylings of the record are so close to the first that my first impression was ""hmmm, shoot"", then the lyrics start lumbering through the melodies in and agonizing attempt to deliver relational complexities, only to anihilate any chance of a catchy hook. Take a lesson from your buddy Tony Harnell, song writer supreme. Anyway - I thought it was weak."
3,Entertaining lightweight fantasy,"centered on the fascinating, very rare and controversial condition of mulitiple indentity disorder. This condition raises questions which go to very nature of consciousness. However, the author here is more concerned with weaving a satisfying, fantasy style storyline around the basic concept, than exploring these questions in any depth."
5,"All my ""souls"" agree...","This is one of the best novels I have read this year! The cast of characters is phenominal, each soul distinct and fully realized, as well as lovable; I really cared for all the souls in each of the two main characters ""houses"".The story kept me going, with enough twists and turns to make it interesting, even exciting as I got to the last pages of the book to see how everyone made it through.The writing was wonderful, I laughed, and cried, and was completely drawn into Andrew and Penny's head, (and heart).I loved it, totally enjoyable!Enjoy, Debbi :)"
1,You Get What You Pay For,"The battery is not the same shape as the original battery and protrudes from the back of the phone causing the protective cover I had purchased for my daughter's phone to no longer fit. Also, the battery does not lock down well and wobbles a lot. The battery works but in the future I will just pay the extra for an OEM battery."
3,Enlightening and Entertaining.,"They went from fossil extraction to reconstructed dino. The episode was well put together, and you don't have to know a lot about dinosaurs to enjoy it. My seven year old really liked it."
5,Great Product,I have used this product for a couple years with my two golden retreivers. Their digestive system is balanced now. I would recommend this product to anyone who has animals that have digestion or intestinal problems.
2,Mixed Results,"I have been giving my 26# dog 250 mg twice a day,with food, for 10 days. He seems more agile but he has had diarrhea. He responded better to tablets of the same dosage crushed in his food.I called the NaturVet and will receive tablets I can crush in my dog's food. I will give it a try. The company stood by their 100% guarantee on their product.If it works out I will further edit this review."
2,Mac Problems,"Using this reader with XP worked great.Using this on my Mac was another story. I have USB 2.0 and 1.1 on my G4 (10.3.4).USB 1.1 worked as expected, slow but sure.USB 2.0 would lock-up when copying large amounts of data. Small files would copy ok.I replaced this reader with a SanDisk 8-in-1 Reader (SDDR-88-A15) and it works great with my Mac and PC.Compact Flash Cards used: SanDisk Ultra II 512MB, Kingston 128MB, Simpletech 128MB."
3,A Reasonably Good Thriller,"Physciatrist, Tess Cicotelli's patients are dying in mysterious circumstances. When detective Aidan Reagan is called in to investigate, he quickly suspects that Tess is behind the deaths. He has a dislike of Tess, due to a previous case that he worked on, where a killer escaped jail, thanks to the testimony Tess gave. However, as the body count starts to rise, he realises that Tess is innocent, and they have to work together to try and catch an evil killer, who seems to know their every move.I did not think that this book was as a good as some of the other books that I have read by this author. I felt it became a bit drawn out, and could have been trimmed down by about fifty pages.On the plus side, the characterisation is up to the Karen Rose standard, the story is suspenseful in parts, and it did have me changing my murder suspect from one person to another, as the novel progressed."
1,trash,"what was she thinking , is it intend to be a thriller , romantic or..born!!I find it really a sex book actually I threw mine into the trash can."
3,Too high a pitched sound,"From more than one of the videos I watched, there was a constant high pitched sound coming from the tweeters. Has anyone experienced that?"
2,Not reliable - buy a different brand,"Sandisk is a big name in flash memory, but I've had nothing but trouble with their products. The same goes with this SD reader. It sometimes crashes the computer when reading cards, especially Sandisk cards, and on one occassion caused the corruption of my Lexar SD card. When there are cheaper, more convenient readers available (like the SimpleTech Bonzai USB reader), why bother messing with this unreliable reader?"
4,Works with a bit of TLC,I purchased this product to convert a brother laser printer to a wireless network home printer. The set up was simple enough but with a windows XP desktop and a Vista 64bit laptop it took a little but of additional back and forth to get it fully functioning. This may be more a issue with having Vista and XP on the one network. Just the same I got it to work with the smallest amount of fuss and bother - recommend it
4,TRENDnet offers an inexpensive way to get older printers onto your network,"The TRENDnet parallel Print server solved a problem for me. The new Vista machine that we had gotten for my son had no parallel port connector. When he moved out, our network printer did not go with him, so I gave him an older personal laser printer. However, he could not connect it to his computer since he had no parallel port. The TRENDnet print server was easy to set up and now, after connecting it to his wireless router, he can print his school work from his main computer or from his laptop anywhere in his apartment. This unit is easy to set up has operated as a ""set it, forget it"" part of my son's network."
1,No good with Windows 7 of Vista,"Windows 7 and Vista are not on the list of supported operating systems for a reason. My systems engineer wasted two hours trying to make this work with a Sharp printer. The XP machine would connect, but not the Windows 7 or Vista machines. If your time, or your technician's time, is worth more than minimum wage, you cannot afford to own this device."
1,Can't get it to work,"Followed the directions exactly, have not been able to get any of my computers to print via normal means, though I can get the server to print a test page to the printer. Haven't contacted customer support yet."
1,Almost as bad as Scrappy,This is a travesty of a show. The animation is done in an odd muted pallet and the plotlines are inane.Shag + Scooby inherit a fortune only to discover that they will now have to deal with a mad.... I think he's supposed to be a scientist but he doesn't seem bright enough to earn a degree.He does have henchmen.I tried and tried to enjoy this show as I am a lifelong scooby fan but this is awful!!!!
5,Every Citizen Should Be Familiar With The Contents!,"This book has gathered together in one convenient place an impressive collection of letters, documents, speeches and essays which clearly illustrate the content of the Founders' souls. This book should be read by every American who considers him or herself a responsible adult. Notice the book is not called 'Republicans Will Eat Your Baby!', nor is it called 'Liberals Posessed By Demons, Communists'. It is aimed at AMERICANS, and that is how we'd better start seeing ourselves if we're ever going to wise up. This Red State/Blue State divisiveness will solve nothing; let's all agree to lay down our weapons and reasonably discuss ways to overcome the problems that are affecting all Americans! Let's all take a breather while refreshing our memories on what this country is really all about! I urge you as my fellow citizen to take the time to consider what this nation really means to YOU."
5,Couldn't take my eyes off it the entire time!,"This dvd is absolute magic! I, being an orchestral player by educated profession (what I went to school for), am always on the lookout for unique and original uses of the traditional classical symphony, and seeing such an awesome group paired with one of the great guitar masters was incredible!As a violinist, much of my tone is modeled off of Steve Vai. In fact, my mentor, a well-known electric violinist who has built a line of instruments with the range of a guitar, has many Vai-like qualities to his style, and likewise with Vai - in fact, they know each other and have worked together! So before I even know who SV was, I was totally into his sounds via electric violin, and when I finally saw him live for the first time, I couldn't believe he had a voice other than his guitar, because it's like an extension of his own being!Highly recommended to watch, especially on a big flatscreen tv with surround sound :)"
3,"Cute film about a young man who briefly meets the gorgeous Barbara Mori and decides to find her, plus his multiple attempts to","get a date.She's not much interested in him. Barbara's role is a rich, mature girl in a big house with a maid that screens people who come to the door."
3,For Those About To Rock,"Look, i'm not gonna lie and start gushing about what a fantastic album this is, 'cause it's not. However, that doesn't mean that ""Do Unto Others"" should be sent to the scrap pile. Speedball follows the simple formula of 'Do one thing and do it well.' In this case, it's performing loud, hard-hitting, in-your-face rock songs that get your blood pumping. ""Hog"" is probably the best example of this, however the other tracks aren't exactly lightweights. The album starts and finishes strong, and leaves you wanting to go beat the hell outta something. Considering the low prices this album is commanding, I'd say it's definitely worth owning - especially if you're a stock car driver or else about to break-up a concrete driveway."
3,not as good as his beginning,I don't think that since Ironias he has gotten a good album out. If you are like me that you kinda did not like Inconfundible well this one is like INconfundible. I did like the arrangement of Asi Fue. So i'll give him 3 stars.
3,"The t-shirt is ok, but it smells a lot","The t-shirt is a regular t-shirt, nice and fun, but it was so smelling when I received, like it was stored in a basement. After wash it everything is fine."
3,Not as water proof as expected,"This would be fine if your sole purpose was to keep ears somewhat dry. I have metal permanent tubes in my ears and cannot get water in them at all so for water aerobics I wear custom plugs as well as this to help keep the plugs in place. However, the fit just isn't right (as an adult with a lot of hair and an average head size I ordered the adult size) as it keeps slipping and I have to continually re-adjust. I would not be able to use this to swim laps."
1,Not very useful,"Unfortunately the band is not very useful because it comes off easily when you are swimming. Bought two, but the second one is going to the trash."
1,broken item,"the camera arrived broken, and according to the type of damage appears to have been released so by the supplier, so I want the prompt repayment of money paid for the cameras."
5,ridiculously funny,"Terry Eagleton is the voice of neo-Marxism. Most of his other books do not even make sense to me at all. But two of them must be read by all accounts. And I do not understand why most people did not realize this. This book is very very funny, I have given this book as a present to smart people arround me and they all liked it, so I am not a lonely psycho telling this to you. If you know a little about Wittgenstein and the history of the early 20th century, you can easly make an afternoon a reading feast. Enjoy. In ""the gatekeeper"" this time he tells about his autobiography, yet I still believe that this book is his best work (my subjective reality, read and see that it is not that subjective after all) cause it is so much fun to read it."
1,Don't buy this phone!!!,"I am on my THIRD V330 phone now, and am about to demand that T-Mobile supply me with a completely different model. The first one wouldn't charge because it wouldn't recognize that the charger cord was plugged into it, the second one had LCD screen problems and wouldn't hold a charge, and for this third one I had a new battery sent to me from Motorola and a new phone, but SURPRISE, I've had it for less than a week and already it won't hold a charge. This phone is a piece of crap, and after looking it up on the internet, I found that a lot of people are having these same problems."
4,battery not good though,"I bought this phone in July. Wait about 2 weeks to get my phone. overall is fine, but the battery seems not good. Each time it uses about 6 hours to charge the battery. Like today, it has been charging for almost 14 hours, still charging! Unbelievable."
1,Unhappy w/ T-mobile,"Not only does the address boook force you to enter multiple numbers for one person as separate entries, the coverage of T-Mobile is spotty at best. In addition, since I am unhappy with the coverage, I tried to cancel w/in my 2 week window- only to learn, that since Amazon.com activated the phone 2 weeks before I even started using the phone, that my 2 week grace periood was over before I even turned on my phone. Now I must fork up the cancellation fee as well as eat the cost of the phone. I am extremely unhappy with T-Mobile for not making an exception. [...] it is automatically activated for you."
2,Not really great quality... disappointed.,"I got it for my son, the price seemed good. He complains that the battery life is poor and it takes 6 hours to charge the phone. The phone quality is not that great either. He dropped it and had to replace it and buy a really good case. The camera is just o.k. If I had the choice again I would spend more and get something better."
4,Fairly satisfied,"Atlanta, GA here, and fairly satisified after using this phone with t-mobile for about 3 months. Calls fade or get dropped occasionally, but this could have been a problem with the person/network on the other side of the connection. Overall, call quality has been OK. Not many complaints on the interface, but sometimes it's annoying to have the ring tone selection buttons on the outside of the case (keys get pressed by other items in my pocket). I use it with a motorola bluetooth headset and works great. Highly recommended if you want to talk while driving. Love the MP3 ringtone because I can have it play whatever I want when someone calls. As for other features (camera, video, etc.), can't say much about them because I don't use them much. A solid phone, given the price."
3,Subpar,"I've had phones with three companies now, and the two phones that I've owned from Motorola (V300 & V330) have been pretty poor experiences. With the upgraded technology, I figured any bugs from the 300 would have faded away, but instead, I've found those bugs plus a couple of others.Someone mentioned charging problems. This is definitely the case. I have to sit there and fiddle with the phone for five minutes just to get it to charge. I'll get ""Unable to Charge"" over and over and finally I'll hit that sweet spot. It is at that point when I must set the phone down very softly so as not to disrupt the fragile nature of the phone.The other problem I've had has been the bars disappearing. I'll be walking to my car and all of the sudden they'll just evaporate. I won't have a clue what happened. I'm not in a dead zone because I've talked to someone in the exact same spot before.I haven't been extremely happy with the phone."
2,Mis-representaion of product,"The product is advertised as a Sony Product ""Sony projector lamp LMP-P201 when in fact it is a replacement lamp FOR a Sony Projector re manufacturedby other than Sony."
4,the best reference kit for 3dsmax,"This resource kit is a great 3D bible. It contains everything you want to know about the program, and it covers everything. It has all three volumes for a good price, but the fact that 2 of them are in Adobe Acrobat form just doesn't appeal to me. I would buy this kit only if you need reference material, or if you want in-depth knowledge of 3D theories and information."
4,"Effective, concise, but overpriced","This book would be a good choice for beginning a study of Mormonism from the Christian perspective. It covers the standard doctrines of Mormonism: the gospel, God, scriptures and authority, sin, baptism for the dead, and human pre-existence.The unique features of this book are its multiple quotations of Mormon authors and sources. Also included are testimonies of former LDS members, which help to get a grasp of how an average LDS person thinks about their faith and what attracts them to Christianity.I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 because of the high price and the general lack of new material in comparison to Christian books already out there. If you already have assembled a library on Mormonism, physically look over this book before buying it."
1,This book has many half truths I have found - misleading,"It is just like my mormon friend said ""if you want to investigate a Ford, go talk to a Ford dealer and drive one. If you go to the Chevy dealer will they tell you the WHOLE truth about Ford?"".My point is made with this example: This book sites that the ""Mormon God"" is still progressing. I spoke to my friend, who is a mormon and he laughed and told me that was ridiculous. God had progressed to the state he is at now, all knowing, perfect and our Father in Heaven, he is not still progressing or learning. I have to say this makes sense to me and I have decided to investigate the LDS faith. I think we would all do better going to the source rather than those that do not believe, to investigate other religions. I at least owe my friend that. He is an incredible example of living the teachings of Jesus Christ. This is what sparked my interest in the first place."
2,cheap and too big,"I bought this for my daughter who is 2 years old and wears a 2t/3t and this costume was still too big on her. It looked horrible when it was on, and the boot covers are very cheap. I would not recommend this."
4,Knots you never knew,"A fascinating look into the world of the knot knut. I am still not sold on the notation ""system"" but the knots introduced are elegant and strong."
4,A Wicked Awesome Comedy Combo,"There is nothing significant about the combo set other than a difference in price. If you want both movies, which I recommend both of them, then it's worth getting the combo to save a couple of bucks. The movies are identical to those sold separately."
5,Buy this!,"I have worked with people with cancer for 30 years. This is the most wonderful book I know for anyone with cancer. It offers a broad and easy to understand survey of the many physical, psychological, and spiritual issues that should be addressed, and includes pages with questions and blank lines after each chapter. I gave a copy to a doctor who had cancer, and she said she would recommend it to anyone she knew who had cancer, and only this book."
5,Works for IBM 4029 laser - set port type to Virtual print port USB,"I read prior reviews, but still had some doubts. Most items discussed HP printers, but I have a very old, but still working, IBM 4029 laser printer, whose print toner cost cannot be beat, and it is fairly fast.I did follow the instructions, as well as download a 'new' driver, since I am putting this printer on a new laptop, with XP. I might not have needed to do this.[...]It was a bit of a struggle, finding the driver, installing, and changing the port type, but it works.Be sure to follow the instruction which IS included in the installation instructions which come with the cable. They mention changing the port type to Virtual print port for USB. I can verify it will not work if you leave it LPT1."
3,A rocky start,"I got this book solely for the short story about Kang and his troops (To Convince the Righteousness of the Right). For that reason alone, this anthology was worth the price. I read that short (the last in the book) first and then went back to start from the beginning. Honestly, if Kang's story had not been so good, I would have thought this a complete wash. The first stories in this book were abysmal, and the middle ones mediocre. But just when I was thoroughly discouraged, I reached Reorx Steps Out. This story, along with Gone, are definitely high caliber. I rated this 3 stars because most of the stories are sub-par, but if you are willing to pay for just a few high quality shorts, you will not be disappointed in them."
4,Rest Well. Michelle,"For somr reason,none of the other reviews mention this.They must be olderreviews. Rest in Peace,Michelle Meldrum.Phantom Blue was the BEST all-femaleband that ever set foot on a stage!!"
2,Crooked Logo,The logo on the small towel is crooked. The logos look cheap so I am going to throw this in the wash right away to make sure they don't disintegrate. Towels are thinner than I expected.
5,"The Third Place DVD by Timothy Meyer,10","This DVD is third Best of the IGPX series.It has so much action you just can't stand it.The best race is in episode 12 (Just to mention it,episode 12 has the a word in it)because it has so much action and leaves you hanging at the end.You have to get the next volume to find out if Team Satomi wins the IG-1 championship against Team Velshtien.And the race against Sledge Mamma is pretty cool too,but when it leaves you hanging the next episode is on the same DVD.All I can tell you is that it is one of the best IGPX DVDs there is.Third best to be precise."
3,"Not 4 discs, not 4X writing speed either","Seeing the title ended saying ""4X"", and the product picture said it was 2X writing speed, I purchased this assuming it was a 4-disc pack.It is not. And the disc doesn't support 4X writing speed either, but only 2X.Don't have a clue what the 4X in the title stands for.I haven't used the disc yet, but I guess it will be OK."
2,Just didn't get it.,"Kudos to Johnny Depp for the idea, but if this album is to spark an interest in Sea Music, it has missed the boat. About 1/4 of the tracks are spectacular. That said, the remaining majority are given treatments ranging from boring to ridiculous. Most of the performers (and the producer) haven't trusted the material to carry its own weight. Too many times a gimmick or an ""innovative"" production value has been slapped on a piece instead of letting the songs (some of which have survived quite well on their own for over a century) speak for themselves. There are exceptions. Richard Thompson's track is a gem as are the tracks with Martin Carthy and Sting. In fact, all the selections done by musicians that have a connection to the world of Folk Music are terrific. When the artist is more concerned with ""Let me show what I can do"" is where this album falls apart. Too bad; great musicians and great material should combine for a spectacular product. This one barely limps into port."
2,I haven't listened to the whole thing...,"...I don't know why I'm surprised about the many occurances of the f-bomb on this CD. I expected pirate songs to be naughty and raunchy--but there's a difference between naughty and filth.I'll wade through it sometime, find the tunes I like and delete the others from iTunes."
5,If you are looking for Unique charts for your Big Band,"I've always luved Basie and as of late lamented that so few bands play his stuff. I have every chart on this CD for my big band. They are richly orchestrated, universally well received by our audiences, and fun to swap out soloists in."
4,Amazing book!,"This book offers a compelling accounts and critical analysis of natural catastrophes such as super volcanic eruptions, giant tsunamis, great earth quake as well as asteroid and comet impacts.We live in a hazardous earth. The west flank of the volcano Cumbre Vieja on La Palma will collapse and the resulting tsunamis will ravage the entire Altanic Rim. Tokyo is the city waiting to die. Seismologists predict a great quake will strike at any time directly beneath the capital; impacts on the Japanese and world economy are tremendous. It is worrying that the 320 meter near-earth-asteroid, Apophis will strike the earth and merits careful monitoring. Although counter-intuitive, some scientists suggest that ongoing global warming may speed up the onset of next Ice Age. Therefore, we must not exploit our earth!"
2,"Very short, indeed",I thought the text was too sensational and jumped around too much. I am interested in natural history but need more facts and details to feel I have learned anything or the author has defended his point.
4,Great Lamp,I bought this lamp on sale to match the brushed nickel hardware on a new bedroom set. It was extremely easy to assemble and it has a very sturdy base. I love that I can just use the reading lamp without having the other light on. It is very stylish and provides ample lighting.
1,Yipe!,"Mine died in a spectacular blaze of fire, nearly setting my curtains ablaze. So, that pretty much leaves out recommending it to anyone. Additionally, before the flaming incident that precipitated its demise, the top part flopped around because the screws wouldn't stay tight for long. On the plus side (lol) it was cheap."
4,cancr,I am always happy with a product that includes Sally FieldSad but well done very nice cast of characters
1,FILE 13,"Not even five minutes into the film and I was completely turned off! The opening conversations are uneducated trash-talk. Scenes with Sally Field showed faint glimmers of her wonderful acting prowess. Even if it were free, I would NOT recommend this flick; it is a total waste of time!"
2,The only reason why I don't like it,Total run time of these short movies are 35 minutes. It could be fun if everything was not so boring and predictable. It's just O.K. to watch.
4,Great movies,If your kid loves Cars he will enjoy these mini-movies. My son loves Mater and watch this dvd over and over again.
5,Mater's Tall Tales,MATER'S Tall Tales:A must have for any Cars fan! Mater and Lightning McQueen are at their best in this friendly fictitious folly!
1,I didnt order it in spanish,I don't know how it happened but the movie I thought I purchased was the English version in the picture and also the title was in English. Then I got the Spanish version.
5,good movie,"very very good price for this blu-ray, jeje my son love it!!best regards from chileantonio conchasaludos XD"
5,This is a Nice Little Journal,"Nice binding, wide ruled for easy writting. Seems to be a high quality product. It is just the perfect size!"
1,Extremely Lame,"This 4 page document had nothing but vague generalties: ""Employee Morale falls when many positions are unfilled"", ""Managers must reassure and motivate employees in down times.""The advice was largely vague and useless: ""Develop an open-door policy"" , ""Make the workplace as pleasant and stress-free as possible.""I'd continue giving a couple of more examples, but then I'd be giving the whole thing away.A rip-off for three dollars. But even more distressing was the time I took ordering it."
5,Awesome Book!!,"I recommend this book to anyone!! My [...] daughter loves this devotional! She does not want me to read anything else. It has a memory verse for each page, a wonderful story/lesson that goes with it, and questions that you can discuss with your child. I like how is is broken into 6 sections, each with a different focus. If you are looking for a way to get your child interested in devotions this is it. I will be purchasing the other books, like this one, as my daughter grows older."
5,Excellent training manual,My dad bought me this book when I was nine years old. That was about 35 years ago. I still remember some of the lessons it taught me and relate them to my 7 year old. This is a great book to teach your child the fundamentals of the great game of baseball.
4,Great Dungeon crawl,"I just got this last week, so I haven't been able to DM it yet, but from reading it I can see that this is a fun adventure. It just lacks an indefinable ""oomph"" that would make it 5 stars. Good interior art, surprisingly blah cover art, by Sczudlo, who normally is awesome. Interesting characters and a big dungeon equals loads of fun."
4,"Cute, comfy dance shoes","I was afraid these would be too small as I ordered just one size larger than my street shoe and so many reviews said to go 1.5 or 2 sizes larger. I normally wear a 7.5 and ordered 8.5. The 8.5 is perfect, but it would be too big if I was wearing these in a real dance class. Please note that these are *dance* shoes. I am wearing them to Zumba class. I tried several other pairs of shoes and they were all too sticky. These allow me to twist and turn easily. I'm really happy with them, but I may go down half a size next time."
5,Good reference book for signal processing,"Good book for reference on biomedical signal processing and more generally signal processing. Small and concise, excellent book for that purpose."
4,biosignal,This book provides tools of prime importance for engineers and researchers involved with biomedical engineering. One outstanding aspect of the book is the the way the the fundamentals of signal processing are presented. Special aspects such as chaotic behaviour of the signals are also presented.
2,Truly pointless,"If you're a cineaste, it can be quite enlightening and entertaining to read the original shooting script that a favorite film was based on. In addition to the screenwriter's comments and directions, you usually get several scenes that were cut from the finished movie as well as occasional odd little changes in dialogue sprinkled throughout and an overall peek at some aspects of the creative process that a film goes through from inception to completion. Unfortunately, that's not the case with this book, since the four ""screenplays"" included are merely transcriptions from the finished films. VCRs were generally available when this book was first published in '82, so even back then this book was a pointless rip-off. Watch the films, skip the book."
5,I THOUGHT I knew alot about breathing,"I've been doing zazen for a while now and I thought that I knew a lot about breathing...as I sat in the back yard reading this book two young girls were taunting me verbally with all their might...using the guilt trip, songs, name calling...among other things, I kept my cool and they knew it was the book guiding me through a breathing meditation. I haven't finished this book yet, but the simple guided meditations are great. It might be something to help you calm your nerves too. Take care."
1,Quit working after a year.,Nice to use when it worked. Doubt I'll buy another. My Intermatic has been working for years. Thought I'd try a Timex digital unit. Bad decision.
1,Boo!,Just got this timer. Pictures were totally unclear. It's not grounded! No I have the hassle of returning it! BOO!
3,Application with CFL and LED Bulbs.,These timers have a trickle voltage when in off mode which shortens the life of the CFL and LED bulbs greatly due to the electronics in the base of the bulb. Works well with a standard incandescent bulb. I called the factory and they confirmed. Not sure why the packaging doesn't make this clear.
1,defective merchandise,these timers do not work. i bought 2 only 1 works i have bought them in the past they do not work
3,it's great for 14 year olds.,"I did not buy this dvd for myself but for a 14 year old nephew. It is not my cup of tea, he however loved it."
5,anaconda,"Ordered for my husband, he loves both movies. watches them all the time. not academy award material (most of those movies are not that interesting anyway) but a good entertainment."
4,Good Historical Reference,"Very rare is it possible to find a publication which stays true to its roots, especially after it has gone mainstream. Al Jazeera Magazine remains a niche title on the edge of media circles in London.I would certainly recommend this title as a collectors reference and am for sure one reader who misses the print publications. aljazeera.com is good, but the magazine packed a bigger punch and was easier to read on the bus and train than the online version!"
4,"People going through life, not really living it.","I really enjoyed this book for what it was--a passage of time. I'll spare you the synopsis since 2 other reviewers have given you that already.What I liked about this book was at times you can actually hear yourself groaning along with the characters bad decisions, and wanting to give them the high five when they make the good/best/or right decision. The ending left me feeling a bit disconnected, but I think that was the point.It's a light easy read. No great mysteries of life solved here, you'll be disappointed if you're looking for that in this book."
5,Memorable,I read this at least 10 years ago but still can recall the vivid characters and the powerful mystery. If you can get a copy read this book
2,Disappointing,"This book is a great disappointment for those looking for photographs or artistic representations of Texas rangeland. The Texas range is art of itself, it doesn't need the embellishment of poor photography. The photographs just don't do justice to the subject matter. Mr. Pritzker's work consists of taking blurred photographs, adding some rambling nonsensical text and calling it art. It's no wonder that Mr. Pritzker has had his work welcomed in places like the San Jose California Museum of Art (per the back cover of the book)."
3,Pretty tough even when cooked medium rare,"Perhaps it is best enjoyed raw, sliced thin for Carpaccio?Or I could use it as a training aid for my plastic poodle who keeps leaving1 Dozen Fake Dog Poop in Bulkaround the house.Either way, I don't care. I finally got my pound of flesh."
5,Keeps Hair Out of Eyes With No Weight Or Pressure,"I have tried just about everything in my goal of keeping my hair out of my eyes when I swim. I don't care about keeping my hair dry. I have short hair. I have tried regular headbands but they make my head hurt. The light lycra caps do a comparable job to this band but a person looks terrible in them. This product is the only hair gear I've found that does the job while adding virtually no weight and letting you look OK to boot. It also does not make my head hurt no matter how long I wear it.I have never had problems caused by water getting into my ears. If that is your concern, you may have to be fussier about the fit than I was. I bought an Adult sized band and it did the job of keeping my hair out of my eyes. The band does slip a bit but that doesn't affect keeping the hair out of my eyes. To keep water out of the ears, I suspect you would need a much more precise fit than I sought."
4,Keep those ears dry!,"My son has had several ear surgeries, and has experienced hearing problems. His surgeon recommended the Ear Band-it. We were given the first Ear Band-It at his office, and subsequently purchased another set here at Amazon. The first set was wonderful, but after daily use at the pool needed to be replaced after about 3 weeks. The band stretched out, and would fall down frequently. The band is made of a neoprene substance and the ear plugs are made of a putty-like substance. When they are both worn together, they do a great job of keeping water out of the ears."
2,"Good, but only when it works... Service is HORRIBLE","I have owned this model for about 6 months now, and it has been nothing but problems. After about 2 months, the computer would randomly freeze and bright vertical lines would show up on the screen. It did this probably once every week. Slowly, the problem got worse, to the point where it would freeze at least once a day. (Note: I have years of experience working with computers as a hardware guy for several companies...never have I had this many problems with a computer).When I contacted the company, they said I could ship it back to them at my expense, at it would take 3 to 4 weeks to get it back. Considering companies like Dell or Toshiba can fix their computers in under a week, this is wayyyy too long.Overall, the computer feels a little flimsy. It is light, and the screen is amazing, but if it doesn't work then none of that matters."
4,"Provides 7 simple, easy to follow steps to grow spiritually","Daily Disciplines for the Christian man provides an easy to follow 7 step plan for improving your relationship with God. It will prove helpful to someone just beginning their walk with Christ, as well as those who find themselves stuck in a spiritual rut. It speaks specifically to the thinking, challenges and egos of men. Undoubtedly most men will find themselves somewhere within these pages. If consistently applied, the growth and inherent benefits will prove to be tremendous."
3,Yu-gi-oh cards,The cards can be used as a stand alone deck or it can be introduced into your current deck. This card came is good for subtraction math skills for younger children (scorekeeping).Of course the game is alot of fun.
5,Greatest parody of a western musical ever made!,"When Red Garters was released in Europe in the mid 1950s, it created a sensation amongst European and English performing artists! The stagey sets, the great singing, the acting done straight, produced a humor not seen before on the screen. It was especially notable when you consider the flood of dead-serious westerns streaming out of Hollywood at that time. ""It's the Code of the West!"" became a byword for a time. When I returned to America I couldn't believe no one had paid admission to see it and that the critics had panned it."
1,Get this DVD only if you must have all of Rosie's Movies,This is a total looser. When I first saw the title I wondered why I was not acquainted with the movie. After I saw the movie I knew why. It must have had a limited engagement and no self respecting medium would use this movie for entertainment.
3,sweet fragrance!,with marshmallow and chocolate...i guess i should have expected this perfume to be sweet...its nice but a little too sweet for me...im sure a girlfriend would love it though!
5,Another book every Oblate should have,"This is an excellent resource for Oblates new and old. I think every Oblate should own this book, along withThe Oblate Life. The only thing I do not care for as much is the translation of the Rule included with this book. I personally prefer Kardong's translation, or RB 1980."
3,Ok but not enough...,"I ordered for 3 sets of corelle. Unfortunately, after unpacked i found that the last set didnt have 1 big plate to make it 16 pieces. how this could happened?!"
2,Disappointed with shipper,"I purchased this item because I was having over a large amount of company & needed more plates quickly. My current pattern was not available as Prime, so I selected this coordinating pattern. When I received this item, the original packaging was labeled ""as-is"" and placed inside another box from Amazon. I was not surprised then, when I picked up the box to hear movement inside: one of the bowls had been broken, and by all appearances was broken long before the package was shipped. I like the plates but was very disappointed with the shipper. I HAD to use the plates because of my time constraints, or I would have returned the set."
2,Colors different for Cups,"Hi All,I liked the design and I am using for 3 months now. But something which bothers me is that Cups are of different shades. Plates are of white color with yellow design.. where as the Cups are ivory color with yellow design. There is a big color difference. I did not return this as I purchased for discounted price from Amazon in Black Friday."
5,appreciating well written math books,"I'm very happy with ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to"" books(I've just purchased ""Algebra"" and ""Geometry"") as I think they are written with a sense of humor, on an unfunny and somewhat dull subject and they let you know what's important in ""The least you need to know"" part so you don't have to fret about recalling every little thing. They are far more clear than the ""Dummy"" books in trying to devour a subject. 5 stars!"
2,Esperaba otra cosa ...,"Al haber oído trabajos producidos por Tony Valor, supuse que este ""Love has my way"" me iba a producir el mismo encanto. Pero no fue así, honestamente no considero un disco para recomendar a los que aman la música disco. Me parece que en el extenso espectro de aquella hermosa música, este album pasa muy desapercibido."
5,Great Album,Tony Valor è Tony Valor per cui non deve mancare nella vostra collezione disco degli anni 70!
2,Seemed outdated,"Didn't care for it personally, it seemed outdated and irrelevant to today's youth and their reading preferences. The basics are there, but otherwise, you could easily read any other book on writing and get the same information. It sits on my shelf collecting dust. You're better off buying ""Wild Ink, How to Write Fiction for Young Adults.""The basic issue I had with the book was how to address teens and keep their attention when today's youth want instant gratification and how to keep them reading page after page. Some Do's and Dont's would've been nice and even some feedback from teens on what they specifically like about different genres would've been helpful."
5,henry daghighian,"I have read this book and i strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to become ""familiar"" with basic technology employed in contemporary ""Gbit""/F-O devices utilized in fiber optic communications. The book is not meant to be used a text book but rather as a detailed survey of techniques and methods developed over the past ten-fifteen years.www.daghighian-henry.com"
4,Good for slower readers,"I love horror movies and thought I'd try some horror books, since I am not that good at reading and wanted to learn how to read better, these books do help you because they are interesting. I recommend them to people who have a hard time reading those big words in books like Stephen King, and hopefully I'll be able to read those later and understand them better by reading more of these kinds of books that are laymen friendly."
5,wonderful,Just how I remembered the stories from when I was a kid....great compilation!Alvin Schwartz is a great author.....and the illustrations are wonderful
2,excited but unhappy,I was very excited to see I theses books I loved them so much my grandpa read them to my sister and me when we were young. I wanted to buy them so I could read them with my daughter I was very upset to find out the the stories are the same but a condensed version so they are not the same at all and some of the best parts of the stories are now gone. still happy to have them but would have been nice to get the original set I intended for
4,brings back memories,"i remember reading these books when i was in elementary school and a few years later they are still as great as i remember. A lot of them are pretty common urban legends that a lot of people probably already know (for example: ghost in the mirror, vanishing hitchhiker) and the artwork is pretty interesting and creepy at least for a childrens book. Great book"
1,Worthless,"This reprint of what should be Schwartz's masterpieces are utterly worthless without the original artwork. The point of Schwartz's work was the true terror it inspired - if you want to emotionally coddle your children with ""less scary"" art, then why are you reading them horror stories to begin with?"
4,These are Not for the Faint of Heart,"The stories you will find in these books are the most terrifying I have ever read. As I understand it, they originate from American Folklore. This, in addition to Gammell's truly disturbing artwork, adds the minute shot of realism that transforms harmless fiction to something that reads more like a short, historical, tale of warning. They are told in a simple, blunt manner, giving the reader the impression that they are hearing a historical account. As a kid I was addicted to horror, but these were the tales that led to literally months of sleepless nights. If you are buying them for a child with a vivid imagination, prepare his or her parents' for the ensuing insomnia."
3,"""Cuban"" currents: Cuban Music from Rumba to Reggae","Oh,... I am sorry, Caribbean Currents: Caribbean Music from Rumba to Reggae.This book has some good information; especially when Manuel situates the music within a broader socio-cultural background. However, if you want to learn about Puerto Rican music, read cautiously (see Manuel's ""everything is Cuban"" stance). Much of his information on Puerto Rico's music is wrong.The fact that scholars have not produced a large, comprehensive series of studies on a culture (PR), although, this of course, is now changing, does not mean an author should blatantly speculate about many aspects of that culture. Where/what are Manuel's sources?"
4,Works Great,"I've gotten 2 of these, one I keep on central time for when I travel in the midwest. I like the fact that it has thermometer, and is otherwise simple to use and reliable. I never trust the hotel wake up calls or clock radios in the rooms. Very small & easy to pack"
4,Amazing book,"This is a great book to have on the bookcase, especially if you are into pre-renaissance art, of which there is a good amount."
1,CRUNCHIES IS DISAPPOINTING,"I've tried almost all low calorie freeze-dried pineapple snacks out there. This snack says it's made in the USA, while most others are imported. One 1.5 ounce package has 150 calories, which makes it about average on the calorie scale. ""Crunchies"" freeze-dried pineapple snacks are not chips, like other freeze-dried pineapple snacks. ""Crunchies"" are chunks of freeze-dried pineapple shaped like canned pineapple chunks you buy at the store. The consistency is very good and it is definitely crunchy. But to me, the flavor was a little bit off. I mean it didn't taste like natural pineapple. The package states that the only ingredient is ""pineapple,"" so I can't figure out why the taste is slightly off. I opened a second package and tried it, but it was the same. A third package was the same. I will not be buying this product again. If you are looking for a tasty freeze-dried pineapple snack, I recommend ""Funky Monkey"" or ""Crunchy N Yummy"" which are both sold by Amazon."
3,you're lucky if you get all the fruits mentioned,"besides purchasing this at the groceries, i ordered twice on Amazon hoping that this product would improve. there is an unequal amount of fruit distributed in each package. out of the six packages only one actually contained mangoes. also, there must literally be only 5 chips of bananas in each package and i have already gone through about 20 by now. the strawberry chips easily get pulverized so if you think you are missing them in your pack, they may already be turned into dust at the bottom.now why, oh why do i still buy them (at the grocery)? my toddler likes the banana chips and mangoes (we now buy the mangoes separately which is another hit and miss on quality). what doesn't get eaten by the little one gets thrown into my breakfast cereal or oatmeal so nothing goes to waste. so for that i'm giving it 3 stars."
3,Good taste but not crunchy,"These have good taste but are far from being ""Crunchie"". One reviewer put the nail on the head with saying they taste like strawberry flavored styrofoam. But I am giving them 3 stars because my child loves them. I don't like the texture at all but she does. I like that they are all natural with nothing added. If you don't mind the texture and can come to grips with the fact that ""Crunchies"" are anything but... then this is a great healthy snack choice."
1,Extremely bitter,"I have had the apples and they great, the berries are extremely bitter. Tough to eat at all. I would not order them again and I may end throwing them away."
5,Almost $4 a bag & messy. So why do I give it 5 stars?,"Taste. A very natural taste. A taste that only God could develop. This is a taste of the promised land (and tastes great with milk & honey). For Weight Watchers folks like me, you'll be happy to know that it's only 2 points / bag. If you're going to a festive occasion, or on a big date, or thinking of using it for your lunch break, stick with Sensible Foods Cherry Berries. But if you're at home, or somewhere where you wont mind getting a little messy, try this. The price is well worth it."
2,Crunchies? Not quite.,"I am normally a huge fan of all-natural, healthy, and organic snack foods such as this one. However, the product is not what it says it is. These strawberries are not crunchy, but rather chewy. For me, they did not have a desirable texture. It seems that one of two things may have happened here; either not all water was removed during the freeze-drying process or somehow air (and moisture) got into the package, taking away from the product's crunch. Also buyer beware, because these packages are only 1 ounce, not 1.5 as the picture and product description state."
3,Seriously biased,"Beresford tries to explain away his lack of sources by referring to this book as a work of journalism, not history. If this is the type of journalism Mr. Beresford practices, it's about high time he be employed by the Fox News channel or by Michael Moore. Very biased, writing almost entirely from the prisoners' point of view. I don't believe there is anything wrong with writing from their point of view, however, I disagree with trying to present it as ""journalism."" Nevertheless, this is a fascinating peek into the mind of the IRA and why they do things the way they do."
2,Less We Forget,A well written book but let's not forget what these people where in prison for. They where in prison for having murdered or helped to murder other people agree or disagree with what they stood for the rule of law has to be upheld no matter what. These people had a choice and they made the wrong one they where not hero's only fools to themselves and there so called cause.
3,"nice content, not the best presentation","This is not the best book I have read on this subject, though it does present original and fascinating info. It is worth a read and yet I was most disappointed in the presentation. The info. could have been presented in a more organized and interesting manner. The author tries to go in too many directions. Still, if you've read all the other books, this one is a great source of additional insight for the student of Irish history/politics."
2,"Although the song was marked as a 52-minute piece of music, it was actually a 26 minutes musice pasting together.","Basically it was a 25 minutes of music fadding out and repeat. I much rather having it as a 25 minute music than having no choice but have to press stop at 25 minutes. I use it to teach yoga and would like to not repeat the music. With the way that CD comes, can't really incorperate in my ipod playlist. The extra CD was an advertising for other musicians. They are a 2-3 minutes clips. Dispointed for the price that I have to pay for it. I wish I could return it."
3,Shipping took over two weeks,"They sent e-mails letting me know that the book had been shipped, and another email saying that my satisfaction was #1 priority. Thats good, but I received the book around 2 weeks after I had order it, it took way too long."
3,Not For Private Practitioners,"This manual is really written for hospital staff, students and practitioners who often handle medically compromised dental patients. There is plenty of details on health screening and tests to perform prior to surgery. For practitioners whose patients are mostly healthy, this book wouldn't be too helpful.However, there are some chapters on implant surgery and other surgical tips, but these are too brief and far more information can be found in more specialised titles."
4,Excellent piece of work,"I'm impressed with the functions of this Weather Station, its large display and its outdoor temp alongwith the moon phases. I like it."
4,Dependable Wall Clock,"Recommended. Good digital wall clock with indoor/outdoor temps. This is the second one of these clocks that I purchased. Only problem with this unit is with finding the right placement of outdoor temp sensor for good signal reception to the clock. Also, re-calibration after replacement of batteries can be a little temperamental. Sometimes, you may need to place outdoor sensor right next to clock to get the initial sync. Then, you can move it to an outside shaded location to give good reading. This unit I bought for my very discriminating neighbor, and he has been very pleased with it. Recommend using high quality long-life disposable batteries to avoid having to recalibrate clock frequently, as would be the case with rechargeable batteries."
2,Fails to get atomic time,"We have one of these at work in a conference room and after the daylight savings time, every meeting we were trying to get this thing to have the right time. It is in a room with a huge glass window (that I have left it in), however it never seems to get the radio update of the right time."
1,"Didn't like it, Didn't work, Sent it back.",Out of the box the unit time display was missing some segments. The clock would never connect and synchronize with the radio station and it's temperature reading appeared to be from a different time zone. Returned to the bowels of Amazon
2,"Remote had problems, but A FIX IS POSSIBLE","A lot of people had problems with the remote. Here is how I fixed it (with Tech help from the manu.).1. Remove ALL batteries.2. Push one of the buttons on the back of the main panel TWENTY TIMES.3. Replace the batteries in the main and remote.4. DO NOT set the clock. Place the remote next to the main unit.5. WAIT 12 HOURS for the system to set itself and synchronize.If the two temps are not within 0.5 degrees once the system synchronizes, you have a faulty remote sensor. The time should also be set by now. YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PUT IT NEAR A WINDOW.I did not like to have to do all this to fix the system, but it did work afterwards as advertised."
4,Does the trick,I use a (very loud and noisy)Marshall head and various effects (floor and rack) and the Hush does what it is designed to do providing you place it correctly in the fx chain and adjust the threshold settings. I play clean to full shred and it keeps my signal very clean and quiet while keeping my sustain and delays intact; again you have to place it in the chain correctly--it's worth every penny.

3,Skip this book if you are a beginner of business writing or business style talking,"I just got this book today and is very disappointed. As a beginner of writing business emails and essays, I am expecting some reference book that can help polish my writing and speaking on job. All this book says is to be concise, use simple word, avoid jargon. Maybe I am wrong, but I really don't see how these simple and straightforward words could be called 'polished'. Also, this book spent half pages comparing words... a waste of money"
5,The Service,I was very pleased with the shipping service of this item. This book was shipped before another book that I had ordered by expedited shipping. I am very pleased with the service. Thank you.
5,cool,"I did an interview with Charlotte Martin a few years ago. We had a good talk. She knows a lot about music and can play and sing really well. She had a little group of die hard fans. Back then she was doing just voice and piano. She was a little raw and a little like Tori Amos. Now she has a full band and the sound is more complex. I like songs like ""Drip"" and ""Little Universe."" This album has hope and passion all through it. It is a little more experimental too. Charlotte Martin hasn't really been conservative at all. It's almost like a real rock record. It's exciting stuff. This is a real mature record. Stromata is like a scientific term. Charlotte Martin is good looking too. Bravo."
4,works with macbook air on mac osx snow leopard 10.6.2,I have the rev. 3.0R of this adapter. At first when I plug it into my macbook air it wouldnt detect the adapter. Only after I installed the drivers from their website which is suppose to be for mac 10.4 did it detect it and started working. So far I am having no problems on my Macbook Air running Mac 10.6.2 I just installed the drivers which are on the trendnet website which is labeled for Mac 10.4 osx. Hope this helps anybody looking to get this adaptor for their macbook air.
5,Works Like a Charm,I bought two of these and now have hard wired both WII's in our house. They work perfectly with no fuss.
5,great adapter,The adapter works great. I would not give it a second thought to buying another one from your right again.
5,Great Product - Easy Install - Works Great!,"I originally ordered two of these (a long time ago) to use with my old Tivo Series 2 DVRs to network them since they didn't have a built-in ethernet port (crazy, I know).They worked GREAT for that, so recently when I needed one for a desktop computer with a fried ethernet port I came right back to the trendnet USB adapter.I hadn't used trendnet much befor these, but based on the quality and reliability of these adapters I'll definitely give them a shot in the future on other products.The adapter was easy to install with the computer -- simply put in the included driver disc and it installed the needed drivers and I was up and going within minutes!No problems, no failures so far -- it just worked!"
4,It works as advertised,I bought this to allow networking with my Hughes DirecTivo and PTVnet from [...] it works perfectly with no issues whatsoever and I would recommend it for any one wanting to do the same with their Tivo
5,Unusual Use - Worked Great,"For my needs it worked perfectly. Admittedly I needed it for an unusual situation. I have an HP MediaSmart Server, which among it's many features, it can completely restore any client computer to an earlier backup date (it's worth it for this alone).Thus was the need for my daughter's computer. She had gotten a computer virus, so I decided to just restore to an earlier date. HP provides a 'Restore Client PC' CD for this. The problem was her computer has Vista 64 OS, and the restore software could not find the built-in Ethernet port. The restore CD is 32 bit, so the 64 bit drivers didn't work. I fussed with trying to locate 32bit drivers, to no avail.So, I bought this. Installed the drivers on a USB thumb drive, plugged it in and 5 minutes later I was restoring. Worked perfect first time.Bottom line is, it cost me $18, but saved hours of headaches."
1,Died in a month.,"Sits on a desk and is used 5 days a week, but died in a month. Would not recommend to anyone."
4,small and plug and play,"Plug and play, works like a charm on my Windows 7 pc.easy to install, and can be hidden in the back"
3,A rip-off,"A good book but enormously overpriced. every year or so a new edition is put out with a few changes which are not necessary. to keep everything uniform in a course, a new edition must therefore be purchased at an inflated price. Much of the photos and material is not new but recycled from the computer program, ""Transparent Language""."
1,save your money,"I am an electrician who needs tools that will work every day, these were not it! Have had the same kit for one year, except mine came with the impact instead of the circular. The impact and flashlight are the only two I have been satisfied with. When the sawzall bogs down/jams on the material slightly, which it does often, the battery drains instantly. I made two 8""cuts on a 1/4 "" piece of plywood the other day and the battery was dead. Almost useless. The V18 hammer drill that came with the kit caught on fire after one year as well. Haven't tried to get it fixed yet..........Very disappointing. I once was a Milwaukee fan, not any more. Wanted to warn others, so they would not make the same very expensive mistake of a purchase."
3,Functions well but monitor isn't that clear,"I have now had this weather station for over a year and it functions well, but the screen isn't nearly as clear as the picture would lead you to believe."
4,weather station,"Nice weather station--gives alot of information. But I wish I could make the display a little darker. I adjusted the contrast but that made the ""background"" of the display show through more. I have this in my kitchen garden window (where there is alot of ambient light) and it's difficult to read easily. But if you are going to put this where there isn't alot of glare or background light it's wonderful. I like the barometric pressure bar graph and the atomic time worked right from the start."
2,The Manual is not very helpful... All works but the wind barameter,"My husband was so excited, when he got this station and could not wait to get it set up. He is a phone guy so he wired it all up under the house and spent many hours setting it up just right, only to have issues withthe wind barameter. We have tried to trouble shoot with the online andhandwritten manuals.Unfortunetly there is no one to contact nor is there an option to return this product once you have it out of the box.. sooooo needless to say theexcitement is gone.."
2,The title does not match the story.,I thought the book repeated itself many times with the same stories or examples. It was too much detail about things not related to the title of the book.I was going to buy copies for others to read after reading the review but would not do it now since I didn't enjoy the book very much.
3,saddam's secrets,Saddam's Secrets is one man's account of being close to the heart of Saddam's rule. An enthralling tale with plenty of excitement to keep you enthralled.
2,I wanted to believe,"I really wanted to believe the information that an insider would share that others might not know, but I'm very disappointed. While General Sada is clearly a brave man, this book was 90% Jim Nelson Black and 10% General Sada. The language attributed to General Sada includes tons and tons of American language quirks, slang and idioms that are simply not used by anyone who has spent the majority of their life in the Mideast. This won't be recognized by the vast majority of people who have never travelled, many of which don't realize that there are very definite American language traits that are not understood by non-Americans. Unfortunately, this severely hurts the credibility of an otherwise excellent book."
5,Chants from Isis,Chants from Isis is a beautiful CD. Nhanda Devi's voice is hautinging beautiful and I found the CD to be extremely relaxing and very good for that deeper meditation.
1,these are the worst speakers ever,"I bought these speakers hoping that they would produce sound better than the internal speakers on my HP laptop. It turned out that these pretty speakers were far worse, having no bass at all and lots of static. After having the speakers turned on for more than 2 hours, the battery life was nearly wasted, as was indicated by the waning clarity and volume of the music. If you want to spend $40 on a decent-sounding pair of speakers, I would recommend going for the conventional ones made by Creative or Altec-Lansing. I personally returned these, and went for some $80 speakers made by Creative, which are just phenomenal."
1,Disappointed,"I'm not a heavy rocker type but these just don't put out enough sound to enjoy the music. The sound is easily overcome by ambient noise.Too bad. It's a great concept but unless you're looking for ""music to fall asleep by"" pass these up.NOTE: Amazon will also charge you to return them. I would suggest you try a reputable stereo establishment that will stand behind their offerings."
3,Perplexing,"I don't get this book. OK, it's about cookie monster and food -- that much I understand. Beyond that, I don't know what to make of it. There's cookie monster shopping for groceries! There's cookie monster eating popcorn! And he's saying weird stuff while he does it! There's a page where he's eating something and the only words are ""Dum de Dum."" What?However, my 2 y.o. daughter loves this book. It was her top choice for a few weeks. We couldn't get to the ""Dum de dum"" page soon enough for her; it cracked her up.I can only conclude that this book is written in some primal code that only small children are capable of comprehending."
3,Decent bag,Good gig bag for the price. Offers protection for the instrument but not much storage space. Will get the job done.
1,"*** BIG SIGH *** Maturity, in ALL THE WRONG ways...","*** BIG SIGH *** Ok, how should I start this off... I absolutely love Brandtson...I have since the beginning, and have stuck with them through their ""changes""... Even with Send us a Signal, while it was a stretch, I felt was a decent album...Unfortunately, this album is WAY OUT THERE... Like the review below, I thought maybe it would grow on me...But I've tried and tried and tried to like this album and simply can't do it...I'm sorry, I really am...I love this band and they have been a fave of mine for many years, but unfortunately I feel that Brandtson have officially jumped the shark on this one.If you are into U.K. dancy goofy poppy stuff, then check this out...If you're a hardcore Brandtson fan looking for a taste of what you're used to from Brandtson, then you're not gonna find it here...Goodbye Brandtson, I'll miss you :-( (tear)"
1,Not A real tool....,"This tool is only really made to use on thin wall tubing. Lasted for about 5 cuts on 1 1/4"" pvc before it broke. I was expecting more ."
2,Does the job but not a precision tool.,"This cutter works as advertised, however as other people stated the blade has too much play. It was very difficult to make straight or precision cuts. I tried several times to make straight cuts, but could never get it quite right."
2,Does not work well with 1 inch pipe,I used this to cut 1 inch PVC pipe from Home Depot and the blade is not tight enough and would cut the pipe in an angle. I would only recommend this if you plan on cutting smaller diameter pipes.
5,Good gum,"This is an excellent sugar-free gum for those who don't want saccarine or aspertame. Many commercial gums that are advertised as containing xylitol also contain unnatural, chemical sweeteners. The flavor and soft texture lasts very well in the peppermint and fruit flavors. Another family member really enjoys the licorice one. The chocolate has a disappointing flavor, and the cinnamon, which to me tastes like almond at first, quickly gets hard and loses flavor. Haven't tried spearmint. While the serving size is listed as 2 pieces, I find 1 is exactly the right amount for my mouth."
1,Garbage,I challenge any literate person to force himself to read one page of this incomprehensible nonsense.
4,Don't fix it if it ain't broke,"Although this text is very, classically, text-ish (minimal illustrations, black and blue ink only, dry writing), it still stands out as a high quality introductory physics text. I used it in my intro level classes, at a university that emphasizes physics education theory. I figure with all the research they have done on undergraduate physics education, their choice to use HRK could not have been one made randomly. I continue to refer to it over the newer, flashier additions, because it still gets the job done, without skipping details in exchanges for full color photos."
1,Worst physics book ever,"Not helpful at all. This book dosn't take the time to explain anything, or any of its examples. Right from the start this book sets itself up to be a ""deep in the old library, only PhDs find this a helpful reference"" type book. From its strictly black and blue printing, to how it expects you to take what it says ""as is"" without a hint of explaination as to why it is."
2,Don't try THIS at home,"While the potpourri and cologne recipes may be fine, I strongly advise against using his soap recipes, as the high percentage of lye isn't safe. If you wish to make soap, please invest in another, safer book--any of the following three have wonderful recipes that don't run the risk of destroying your skin: The Natural Soap Book, The Soapmaker's Companion or The Handmade Soap Book."
3,A curious overview,"For a single CD compilation ""Greatest Hits,"" this does little to freshen the band's previous greatest hits package, 1988s ""All of this and Nothing."" The classic Furs cuts are here, but for a survey of anything after 1988, this offers a poor compilation of what's best from ""Book of Days"" and ""World Outside."" Those curious about the Furs would do better to invest in the 1997 Sony/Legacy ""Should God Forget."" As close to a box set as your going to get,this 2-CD retrospective has all the essential Furs hits of ""Greatest Hits,"" some great previously unreleased gems, and the decent cuts from the Furs most recent studio work. Rumor has it the band is in the studio recording a new album (6/01), and their recent US tour (2001) has Richard Butler in fine vocal form and appearing to enjoy being on the road again. Bandmates John Ashton and Tim Butler are a tight ensemble. Whatever CD you chose, the Furs have been an overlooked and underappreciated band of the 80s. Long live the Furs!"
3,Still Sort of Interesting,"I have moved out of a part of my life where I thought this stuff was intelligent, but it still has some interesting energy that is worth checking out. Richard Butler, in his Bowiesque way was a very unique phemonenon. ""Sister Europe"" ""Love My Way"" and ""President Gas"" are let me say, creative.Listening to the Furs is like taking a trip to the underground. It's like watching a violent Sean Penn movie and feeling glad that is not you're not immersed into that kind of world. When it comes to Richard and the gang, it's an interesting place to visit, but I don't want to live there."
5,It's the BBC...so what would you expect!?,"Two friends hooked me, and I have hooked several others into watching this...unrivaled acting, enough intrigue to please those who like a little mystery,and great panoramics (perhaps Blenheim Castle estate?).... There's more! This series captures the life struggles of a century and a half ago...with enough comedy and lightness to make watching it thoroughly enjoyable. It's a must-see for those with taste!"
5,A CHARMING SERIES,A charming series. Has been a delight to watch since the first episode. Great characters that feel like good friends. Very upset this has been cancelled.
5,wrestling a a way of life,La Lucha the Struggle is a very well made documentary. It gives you the feeling of all the training and dedication that is necessary to be a good wrestler.I find it could be a great find for even people who don't know anything about wrestling.I think a little explaination about the film would have been nice. I had no idea it would be a real life experience.
3,"Worked with my dvd recorder,sort of.","I bought this remote as a replacement for the factory remote that came with my cheap wal-mart magnavox dvd recorder. The factory remote was very poorly made and broke within a few months of using it. I tried several other universal remotes that I own and purchased a few others, none seemed to work with this dvd recorder. So I searched amazon and found this one that states it is made for dvd and it is the same brand as my player. So after I got this and tried all of the codes for magnavox dvd recorders, none of them worked. I had to use a code for a standard magnavox dvd player and am not afforded the functionality of the specific dvd recording buttons. The remote works and learns functions easily. The enter button on the dvd directional pad is hard to push as it is sunken in too far. All in all not a bad remote for the price,but better if it supported all the dvd recorder function keys!"
4,Stupdi but charming,"I once read a review that said given the choice between a stupid movie that knows it's stupid and a smart movie that knows its smart, always go with the stupide one. And this movie is definitely stupid. The killers have pretty shoddy motivations. The undertaker jokes are strained and the women show up only to get murdered.But despite that, it has its charms. The music is pure Franky and Annette at the beach and the long shots of bikes riding through the hills of California are just beautiful. And how can you really ruin a cannibalism story. The fake blood is decidedly fake and the jokes are corny. Still if you have enough booze or pot, this movie is a perfect capper to an evening."
1,Game Stinks,This Game Really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really RRRRREEEEEEAAAAAALLLLLLYYYYYYYY STINKS
2,What?,"I like the format of these books, but the problem for me is that this one does not fulfil its brief, which is presumably to be, as its title implies, an introduction to a difficult subject for those not well-versed in science.I am an interested member of the latter consituency, but I found this book presupposed far too much background knowledge - especially of terminology. Not enough is explained for those of us reformed Luddites who need to be hand-held in these matters. I shall try elsewhere. (Luckily, the field of `popular science` writing is a rich and fertile one these days.)"
5,FABULOUS!!!,"This is an exquisite tribute to a poet and song-writing genius. Love all the artists, especially the Wainrights, Antony and that phenomenal rendition of ""Anthem"" by Perla and Livingston."
4,Tribute to the maestro,"I was prepared to fly to the other side of the country when I read about the performances of Came so far for beauty at the Sydney Arts Festival in 2005. Unhappily all seats at all shows were sold out in about 45 minutes of the sales opening so I was delighted when this album was released. There are some very good tracks on it and some not so good so that I wonder why they bothered (interpretation is flat and uninspiring compared to the original - an unfair comparison, really. Nobody gets near...). I've now ordered the DVD of the film, the visual performances might make a difference. Still, the good stuff outweighs the ordinary, putting this album in the highly recommended category."
1,Leonard Cohen: I am your man,"It is bad! As much as I like ""10 new songs"", this one disappointed me a lot."
3,okay,I bought this over the Bebe Pod becuase some reviews said it was for bigger babies. I have a big baby and he out grew it by 4 months. It is supposed to be for 12 months. The tray would barely latch because of his legs. I really liked all the attachments that came with this. I had to let a friend with a smaller baby use it. She enjoys it.
3,bebePOD plus infant seat,I purchased the seat and started using it on a an almost 6 month old child while feeding infant cereal.Another model made by another company called the Bumbo baby seat was in the news this week (Oct.2007) that they are recalling their model because it caused severe head injuries to the infant. If the infant tried to reach for something it could tip over.I would suggest never putting this seat on a table top and never leave the baby unattended. I sit with the baby while he is playing with the attachable toy or eating with the cute tray covers attached. It works fine right now and is just the right size until he is ready for a high chair. I am happy with my purchase.
2,completely different looking tree,"The tree that was pictured was a nice, full, even looking tree, the one i recieved was lop sidedand missing bark in places, basically odd looking. Since this was my first purchase from Amazon.comI don't think I'll be back for another, especially if what you see isn't what you get."
1,lens for z812is,I purchased this lens and it came with camera adapter. The camera is a large zoom camera (x12). The adapter is so long that the most you see is the inside of the adaptor. Zooming out the camera did not make this a wide angle system. When I sent it back to 47th street camera they deducted the mailing costs. So far they are into me for three mailing cost and I have no product (but I am still hoping).
2,TIP OVER DANGER!!!,"Like most of the other reviewers we loved this stroller when we bought it. It was great for maneuvering around tight areas, especially small elevators! Curbs and bumpy sidewalks were no problem. My son just turned 2 and is 3 feet tall. He still fits well in the stroller but as he has grown it has become more and more unstable. With the brakes locked and the stroller sitting on a flat surface it has TIPPED OVER TWICE AND NEARLY TIPPED OVER A THIRD TIME! All while my son was strapped in!! The last time my son hit his head on the concrete!! He could have been seriously injured!! The wheel base is just too short for the height of the stroller. Add a toddler reaching out of it and you have a potentially very dangerous situation!! I gave it two stars because it worked great when he was a baby. It was just what we needed. Now, it's another piece of junk taking up space in our garage!!"
2,You Should Know,"This stroller (Jeep Liberty Urban Terrain) does not have AIR (pump included) wheels.After the stroller was delivered, I discovered that it does not have air wheels like some of the reviewers said it did. The wheels are plastic. Now I am left wondering if any of the reviews about this product are based on experiences with this stroller."
3,iPod-MP3 on the go,"This is a nice set of speakers for travel! I have an iPod and several other devices that I like to listen to. Having a small set of speakers that fold up and protected for travel are great for breafcase (backpack style). The only little complaint I have is that the cable that plugs into the player is very short. It's ok if you are going to have the speakers and player right next to each other, but if there is any room needed you have to use an extention. But overall, even the sound is great and being able to power it from a notebook PC is nice for when I'm watching programs downloaded from my TiVo."
1,echo,These speakers were not good at all- you can hear the music but not the lyrics. There is a big echo and you can not make out the words. I would not recommend this product at all.
3,"It's okay close up, but won't do anything for a room",I brought this one year for my daughter for Christmast to use with her Shuffle. It's nice because it goes by batteries and has an on/off switch so you don't waste the batteries. The only drawback is that it's not very loud. If she's sitting at her desk listening to it - okay. But if she's listening to it and trying to do something like clean her room - the noise in the room is just about as loud as the speakers.
4,Best deal for the price!,"Pro: Cheap, portable, multi use (beyond iPod/iPhone), and a good sizeCons: head phone cord should be longer.If it was 1-3$ more I would willing pay for a wall plug for the USB power cordOver all: I feel bad listing a con for the price it is offered. You won't be able to use this for a big party but this compared to your phone speakers or nothing is well worth the money!"
1,Cheap quality for the price,"It is getting harder and harder to find stainless steel bakeware, so when I found this pan I purchased it. Unfortunately it is not as heavy duty as I would like. It has the weight and feel of the cheap bakeware you would find at target or walmart but in stainless steel instead of the usual non-stick junk.Also, when I opened the box I found that the corner of the rim had been bent. That tells you right there how cheap this pan is. I recently bought a stainless steel tray for my toaster oven and there is no way I could ever bend it's rim and it was only 6.99.I sent mine back for a refund.My search continues."
3,not the same anymore,"If you're expecting the band that churned out the first three albums you will be slightly disappointed. Even though the band's playing good it just doesn't jell like it used to. It's kind of what else to do, we don't know nothing but playing but this album is not as fresh as the earlier stuff. Having read other reviews I ordered blindfold since it seemed the band were still what it was particularly on their first two albums. Too bad that they must have failed to sell sufficient amounts of those gems to have their label backing them long enough to allow the band to find their crowd or niche."
3,"Solid, but disappointing","This isn't a bad book, but I was frustrated that no topic was covered in enough depth. The broad overviews went well, but when the author got into specific design patterns or algorithms, I was reminded of the classic Monty Python ""How To Do It!"" sketch, where the lesson on How To Play The Flute consisted of ""well, you blow in this end and wiggle your fingers over the holes"".Those just looking for a survey of the field might be satisfied, but those who want to understand the technologies in detail will be left wanting, especially given the steep price of this book. I'd recommend the O'Reilly ""Peer-To-Peer"" book edited by Andy Oram instead."
2,Or Maybe I'm a Moron,"Length:: 0:08 MinsFirst of all, the ""O-Rings"" on the diagram weren't included in the box. I presume I'll need them, but I can't turn it on yet, because:How the heck do you GET the carbon in the thing? The ""Media Canister"" has a big honkin' hole in the bottom! I may be really, really stupid, but I followed the instructions and promptly poured carbon straight through the container, into my nice, tan carpet. Well played!"
2,arrived broken,"Broken magnet. I have three of these canisters, and although they are marginal as filters, they work great if you use a prefilter on the intake., this one arrived with a broken magnet. Box was intact, so it left the factory like that.I have ordered another magnet. Not worth haggling over shipping back."
5,Fantastic,Well worth the money if you grew up watching G Gundam and love it. It's been a hit with my friends at college!
1,Are you for real?,"Yeah, you know what? If you wanna rap, go do rap. This is not your genre. You look uncomfortable and I feel uncomfortable listening to you. Maybe the reason why you're not doing rap is because you're terrible at it and you knew that nobody else was doing it in country so you put on a cowboy hat and figure you're all set. Well, guess what? You have no talent and you look ridiculous."
2,blah,"MC Hammer meets Brooks and Dunn. Honestly the rap evensounds outdated! But what more what you expect from a 35year old that took 18 years to catch a break?Stay ahead of the music curve? This fad will be over bythat time. It appears that last reviewer beliefs that youare close minded if you don't listen to this. I think youjust aren't being realistic, and it's probably because ofyou're youth. You'll grow up somebody son and realize thatyou don't have to enjoy everything that is pushed off onyou.Good day kiddies"
2,Decline in music continues,"It's a REAL shame guys like this are able to get a recorddeal. Why? This simply isn't good music at all. I'd say itit ranks up there with Heavy Metal as some of the most annoying""music"" that you can hear. Why do record labels do this to us?It's offical the art of music has went to the dogs!Hick-Hop? Gee, now THAT's creative!Why does almost everything that comes out in entertainment(movies and music) suck these days?"
1,This is sad,"Man, this is sad. A rapping cowboy,are you for real? Seriously Troy, you sound like a cross between Sir Mix A-Lot and Vanilla Ice. Buddy, give it up, this album is total garbage. I listened to the first clip and could barely contain my laughter. It's sad that there are people out there who 1, actually bought this and 2, actually ENJOYED listening to it!"
4,"This is a funny cd! ""hick-hop"" is awsome!","I bought this a few days ago, and I ENJOY IT! It is alot like Big&Rich's cd. It is funny!"
5,Great start,"I am a certified system administrator and I never had the time to study SQL. Finally I decided to sit down and learn ,I ordered a few books trying to build a nice and gradual study course. The book I satrted with is the Weekend Crash Course. I am very happy to say that I found a book that explains basics with good examples thus giving me a smooth start...What I like about this book is that on one hand it doesn't intimidate you as a newbie to a system that is obviously huge and on the other hand it provides you with an adequete level of knowledge to feel that you have gained knowledge."
4,Good choice,"It is a good and cheap product. The sound clarity is excellent for chatting over Internet and hearing songs. Only disadvantage is the length, it is tooooooo lengthy but I think most people prefer this length."
3,"Works Great, but uncomfortable","i've been using this head set for about 6-8 months now and it has worked great. However, if you plan on using it for more than an hour or two it tend to get uncomfortable. The part of the headset that goes around your ears sort of has an edge on it, so it hurts my ears after awhile. But if you are only using it for short periods of time it works great!"
2,"Ok, but not great. Lasted about a year",For the price these are ok but had problems with the microphone after about 6 months and it finally went out completely after a year. The over the ear style takes a little getting used to and can be uncomfortable with glasses.The speakers still work fine and the sound is good. Easy to connect and didn't require any special drivers.
2,very uncomfortable,"I've owned this headset for about 3 years, it came free with a collectors edition of UT. It is HORRIBLY uncomfortable. The plastic piece that sits on top of your ear has a slot cut in it for the wires that run to the earpieces. The sharp edges of the slot press down on top of your ear and become very uncomfortable after a little while. I had to wrap mine in yarn to make it usable.I will say it has been pretty durable, and I don't have any issues with its functionality."
5,Can't complain,Bought this for $14.95 with prime shipping. So far it's performing better than I was expecting.
4,Great price and works well.,"I purchased this from an amazon seller and I was hesitant because the price I was so reasonable, I figured it may end up being a piece of junk. I was wrong. It works fine and for the casual user who wants something inexpensive for basic things like internet chat, etc., this works great. I purchased mine to use with Skype chat in order to answer questions I receive from my e-bay store customers. Voice chat makes it easy for e-bay shoppers to contact me and the Logitech headset has worked great since I got it a couple of months ago."
5,One of the best for newbies,"Kudos to Michael for this volume (and all his others) . . . a great intro plus lots of material to use and practice long after one becomes a star (well, not me, but the reader of this!). Clear explanations, great examples. Would have given it six stars if the CD was a tad easier to navigate, but, alas, that is really just a limitation of such technology (vs. MP3, etc.). Michael's next book should be Guide to Playing Snare . . . a close-up on the core kit element (he's already got percussion and much more covered). A+ . . ."
1,Terrible short movie,"This is one of the worst adaptations of a short story EVER. I bought it for a film class I am teaching, and it is my exemplar of how NOT to make a movie!"
3,Higland Lady,"This book has one of the strongest heroines I've come across in a long while. Elen, is as much a warrior as her hero Munro, who is also her prisoner. Her sister is kidnapped by Munro's brother and to get her back safely she takes Munro prisoner. She treats him fairly and during her visits to him to get info on why her sister has been kidnapped and if she's ok, Elen falls for Munro and he for her. He is clueless as to why his brother has done what he did but starts to actually enjoy being Elen's prisoner. After the kidnapping is resolved and he is released he tries to woo her with gifts but she is not impressed or at least she appears that way. He finally enlists the help of the scottish king, his friend, to make him marry her. The whole thing almost blows up in his face but in the end she she is as happy as he is. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it highly."
5,Best embosser ever,embosser makes everything professional. My new business is better because of the embosser. I would reccomend this embosser to my friends.
1,This headphone has low sound quality and no Noise Canceling.,"""Noise Canceling"" definition on the Web = A technology that reduces the background noises but enhances the sound.What Philips HN100 has?- reduce background noise = NO,- enhance the sound = NO,- humming noise = YES, when ""Noise Canceling"" is ON,- bass/treble = very little,- suitable for MP3 player = NO, in fact even without the ""Noise Canceling"" you have to turn volume on your MP3 player to the MAXIMUM(yes, like 25/25 on my Creative Zen Xtra)."
1,No...,"I bought this card thinking it would blow Nvidia out the doors, but I was wrong. The performance isn't bad, but it has many disappointments, such as when you set the resolution to 1600x1200, your desktop gets stretched at least 5 inches bigger than your monitor on all 4 angles, and you're stuck scrolling around to find your icons and taskbar. I've tried many times to resize, but the resize options barely work, the duel display is horrible, especially if you compare it to GeForce's nView, which rocks, and works perfectly. This card also misplaces all your games when you set the resolution too high (in game), I've never had this problem with any GeForce card. So if you're used to GeForce cards, stick with them. If you're looking for a good card, get a GeForce FX 5600 256MB DDR."
2,80 to 100 degrees??,"If your comp is getting to the point where you are getting over 100 degrees, then you should do something about it.Special graphics card coolers are out there.Althought I have not bought this card, I am sure it kicks the 5600XT that I have now, and am still in the market to wait for prices to go down a bit."
2,Seems a bit flaky,"I love the concept and simple (implied) ease of use of this item, but when I actually used it, it didn't work so well. Some days it worked fine but then other times it would turn on too early or too late (not at dusk as designed) or not at all."
2,Received broken,"I got it with both clips that attach the motor to the canister broken. Didn't even get to try it, so don't know how well the filter performs. But the broken clips is either a bad sign of the durability of this product or the attention to detail of this seller."
5,excellent filter,"Great filter for freshwater tanks. I have two, one on a 4gal and one on 10gal. The water stays clear in both tanks and I like thefact that I can use whatever filter media I like."
1,It started out strong but it didn't last to long,Stopped workin after a month. Rip off.I would not Buy again. I am hoping for a refund. Verry disappointedDon't make the same mistake.
5,Love It!,I have had several different filters that just could not do the job but this filter is great! I have a 55 gallon tank with turtles and it keeps the water clean.
5,Great Filter,"After buynig several filters over the years this is a very well made unit. The material of the lid is thin, but so what. All it does is keep dust out and help with evaporation. It works fine. Of the other reviews that is is noisy all I can say is mine is very quite and you have to look at the water to see that it is running.(I have heard noisy ones this isn't) I have a 36 gal. bow front and the fact you can tone down the flow at feeding time is a plus or if you have some delicate friends it's very usfull. If your looking for a new filter I recomend this one, also like the 3 filtering masses so you don't loose all your good bacteria when you do a cleaning. I don't write reviews but thought this one was worth it buying this was helped by other reviews which some of the bad ones could not have been more wrong! IMHO Very happy!!! Or you could buy a canister that will cost many times this price!"
5,aquaclear 110 the best filter ever,"Hello, I've kept this Jovy since I was a child, I always liked the goldfish, for I have seen them grow from toddlers to have 12 or more inches and I can assure that there is no HOB filter like these acuaclear 110, not only for water quality they offer, but for perfect motion that produce,I always have the problem of clody water after 2 days were placed in my tank.In my 75 gallon tank with 2 AquaClear 110 just do a water change every 20,15 days, or just when filters asks me to, I give my Goldfish 3 meals a day ,I have 7 goldfish 2 large (8 inches), 2 medium (6 inches) and 3 small (2 to 5 inches) water can not be cleaner, it amazes me month after month, I could never do this until I put the two AquaClear 110 filters, the ammonia level to zero,just like the nitritos.Thanks hagen for a tremendous product.[...]"
4,Good Filter,"I use this in a 10 gal tank, which some may think is over kill, I purchased this to replace a smaller filter. My only draw back its not as quite as other Aquaclear filters I have had."
5,"Great filter, no issues","I have 2 of these filters. Both on 46 gallon bow-front tanks. One tank is set up for African Ciclids, the other freshwater schooling fish. Both of these NEW filters have had no issues.You will need to pull apart the filter media and wash it out once every other month or more, depending on how messy your fish are, and take a old toothbrush to the inside of the filter to clean it out.This newest order was to replace one that burned out. Same make and model, just older. It came with the tank, and the motor on the pump had probably been running for 6-7 years straight without much of a break. Pretty good for such an inexpensive item.You can only expect so much from an electrical device, and this device gets my nod of approval.I will buy again!"
1,Leaky Filter,"The filter looked fine, and the it arrived in a timely fashion and well packed. Unfortunately, there was a leak somewhere -- either in the seal or other part, and we came home to a wet carpet. Have since returned it. I'm sure that's just one of those things that happens occasionally. So it's hard to review this particular product. The AquaClear Filter has a good reputation, and we may get another one anyway."
5,Great HOB Filter.,I prefer canister filters but this is a great HOB filter if you don't like canisters. I use this on my 30 gallon half moon tank and it keep it clean.
1,Buyer Beware,"I've been using Aquaclear filters for over 20 years, so I'm very familiar with them. First thing I noticed when I unpacked this filter was that the filter case was dirty, scratched and had water spots!?!? Uh..oh! Then I noticed there was no lid with it. Fine...I'll use the lid off my old Aquaclear filter I thought. Then I unpacked the motor and noticed how used it looked. Checked the impeller...broken. Next I unpacked the filter media, only to find them in a ziplock bag and wet! They freakin' sent me used media!?!? And the Biomax media bag was missing! I wouldn't accept free items from this vendor, let alone buy anything from them again.Oh...in addition, as I was packing this back up to return it, I found a small crack where the spout meets the main body of the filter. I doubt the filter would have worked without leaking."
1,Worst fish tank filter.,This is the worst fish tank filter I have ever had. The first one I purchased from a pet store. It worked O.K. for a couple of months and then began to make noise. I returned this filter and ordered another one through Amazon. This one did not work at all. I returned it and ordered another just to have a different problem - it did not work either. I returned yet again and ordered another. This one did not even turn on. I am returning this one and going to an entirely different type/manufacturer.
4,good waterfall filter,"This is a great filter for what it is: a small waterfall filter for limited fish. I am presently using it on a 30 gallon tank holding my Koi that are being overwintered in the basement. Since they aren't very active at 50 degrees, this is working well. I understand this is a waterfall filter, but I wish the uptake tube had a bit more versatility to it. While it has an additional tube to stick on the end for deeper tanks and a multi-layered filter, I'm not sure I would be confident using this on much more than a 40 gallon tank. In fact, I'm kind of nervous using it on a 30 gallon tank: I just don't think it turns the water over enough for what it is ""rated"" for. So my rating is based on what I am using it for, not the 70 gallons they claim it is rated for. Is that clear or more confusing?"
5,Great Filter,"Hi..if you are reading this and looking for a new or replacement filter, AquaClears are great. My 70 (300) is extremely quiet and my aquarium is crystal clear. Even though the filter comes with sponge, carbon and BioMax, you can set it up which ever way you want. The sponges can be washed in aquarium water to save a few dollars and maintain your biological filter. Cleans easily. The old number represented the gallons per hour. The new number represents the maximum size aquarium. Good luck."
1,Terrible writing by non-DBAs,"This book reads like it's written by a couple of high schoolers who didn't have their grammar teacher look over their work before it got into print. It reads a lot like the incomprehensible nonsense on Hotek's Web site. It also reads like the people who wrote it aren't actually SQL Server admins. It reads like they're consultants. I don't think these guys would know the daily life of a DBA if it jumped up and bit them on the a$$. Hotek in particular is a singularly bad writer. One sentence fragment after another litters his work. After seeing this, I will never trust another thing Hotek says."
2,Flat and impoverished,"People I respect like this poet, but I find her work self-satisfied, uninteresting, flat and impoverished."
2,Never gets going.....,"Shadow Chaser tries to be a mysterious thriller...building tension around the hero's secret abilities. He doesn't know what he can do, he just knows everyone wants a piece of him.Ultimately, the story falls short of accomplishing anything. The big reveal is anti-climatic. By the time answers to all the questions come, it doesn't matter because the story has dragged out so long. A case of too little too late."
5,This is the best polished ever for silver and brass.,"Maas polish is easy to use and the results are fantastic. The shine lasts longer too. My only complaint with the order was that the can was shipped in just a large, unpadded envelope and the top rim was badly dented, making it difficult to open and close."
5,Another Great Product,I have used Maas products before but I really like the 1# can. It makes it so easy to use.
3,Solid card with quirky install...,"SMC's low-end EZConnect 10 (1208) is a Combo card with an RJ-45, ThinNet, and ThickNet connectors. The chipset is made by RealTek, which speaks for this SMC's low price. PnP Installation into Windows reads as a RealTek, yet SMC instructions say to add specific SMC driver on top of existing Realtek(?)drivers. Subsequent install is painless and configuration is set default to ""Autosense"" for simple Point-and-Shoot networking.SMC gives you a free 6 ft. CAT5 Cable and a TurboLinux CD-ROM with each EZConnect 10. Lifetime garantee. Not a bad deal for the asking price. Good performer for small home networks."
1,Was I missing something here?,"Um, it's not by choice that this has 1 star. I had no choice. I tried giving it a zero but that wasn't an option.Okay, so a deer spoke to this man. Maybe it was some type of allegory. Who knows? I wanted to put it down. Believe me, I did. However, I didn't want to miss the symbolism, if perhaps there was one. All I can say is ""I didn't get it - the story that is."" I wish I could say I didn't get the book either. Do yourself a favor, don't you get it."
4,Letters from Abigail,"Upon hearing of a romance written by a male, I was intrigued. As a librarian, I'm always interested in local writers. Reading the ""blurb"" about a World War II encounter then an attempt to find the lost love further attracted me to the book. The element of a surprise packet of letters from a former romance was an additional draw to the book. Learning of Jack's ""heartache and disappointment"" yet his reluctant determination to find answers to old questions proved to me this title was going to be worth my time and concentration to read. Darrell Rachel did not disappoint me as a reader. Reading it during the Christmas holidays turned out to be just a great experience and I have found another book I can recommend to my students."
2,Not a movie,"Buyers should be aware that this is not actually a ""movie"", but a narrated reenactment. It made me feel I was back in grade school. Still, evenso, it retained much of the wonderment that I felt with the school movies and the action and pretty guns going off. If you watched Last of the Mohicans, or Drums along the Mohawk, you will be disappointed when you come to this. It is nicely done, but not tops."
3,Not quite what you might expect...,"I bought this CD expecting to get a good representation of a famous artist, but also to find some good recordings of the individual tracks that I can listen to for fun. I'll say that Mr. Arrau's artistry is in no way different from what I thought it to be, but the recording quality ranges from questionable to dismal. The recording of the Islamey is almost impossible to hear over white noise. The Islamey is the worst recorded, but the others sound like a scratchy radio broadcast.On the other hand, most of these recordings are very good just to hear what is (or was) considered good technique and phrasing. My only complaint here is Faschingsschwank aus Wien. It sounds like Mr. Arrau was under the impression at the time of recording that the set was written by Chopin, not Schumann. I would recomend Murray Perahia's recording of these pieces."
2,Didn't much care for it.,"Bored. As a med student, ... I like to make allowances for film, but this pretense had me yawning to tears. Goodnight and good luck."
5,"Sleep Tight, Little Bear","Author Martin Waddell and illustrator Barbara Firth have gotten it right again with this, their 7th, Little Bear book. In each book they capture a universal aspect of the parent-child relationship and this one is no exception. It is a timeless and touching tale of love and trust. The illustrations extend the text and add great details for the child to look at while being read to. The DVD interview with Martin Waddell which is included also increased my appreciation for these wonderful tales."
4,VERY GOOD,Actually my rating would be a 4 and a half stars -- the story was really good but I find the premarital sex puts me off and causes disappointment in the characters --Good story for all who like this type -- wouldn't pass it up but don't know about keeping it.Read and enjoy!
4,Slipcover,This item came quickly and was exactly what it was advertised. It's difficult to put on if you don't all ready know how. Very cute print and simple.
3,Wish they weren't quiet,"These are cloth, and so when they fall over, they are quiet. My son would be a lot more excited about this, I think, if you could hear them as they were getting knocked to the floor."
1,Not what you expect!!!,"I bought this set for my nephew. When I received it, I was surprised to find how SMALL the item was. It might as well be a table-top bowling set! Each ""bowling pin"" is only 1-2 inches taller than a soda can and about the same diameter as a soda can. Not worth the money at all!"
4,Adorable inviting monsters,The monsters are attractive rather than frightening. And the soft-construction cuts down on possible destruction. All in all a great success!
4,"very cute monsters, slight balancing act to put them upright","my one year old loved pulling these guys out when we gave them to him. he likes how they look. probably will take a while to get the hang of how to throw the ball at them to knock them over, but i think they're great. it takes a little balancing act to get them upright side by side, but they knock over well with the ball."
5,Cute gift. My grandson loves it.,"Soft, colorful and enviormental friendly for indoor use. Kids love the color nthe monsters come in. Easy for baby's to use."
4,2-Year Old Gift,"We bought this for our nephew, and so far he likes it! The monsters are really cute, and soft. They would be great for little ones to carry around when they're out and about, but can also be used as the full set for bowling :) It shipped on time, and the price was about half of what I found elsewhere."
3,cute but doesn't work well for bowling,The monsters are cute and good size for game of bowling for toddler. Unfortunately it requires too much more power than my daughter has to knock them all down in formation...with the ball. They are just a bit to heavy by themselves to fall down easily.Luckily she is also too young to care about playing them like real bowling so she still very happy with the monsters as her new friends.
2,Not what I expected,"I was told that A Rose for Emily was one of Faulkner's best work in a gothic story. Unfortunately, it didn't do that much for me. I didn't hate it but I didn't like it either. It just fell flat and I was bored all the way through. In an article I read they compared his work to Edgar Allen Poe how dear they). If you are looking for a quick read in the gothic area A rose for Emily is definitely not it. Check out Edagar Allen Poe's ""A tell-tale heart"" or "" The cask of amontillado"""
4,"not perfect, but it's the best for the price","If you're good at learning languages and you already have some knowledge of one of the romance languages, this book is for you. If not, don't buy it.Actually, when I bought it, I thought the CDs came with it, but they don't! So I returned it and got the package set with the book, CDs, and dictionary.It's the easiest to use for the price. All the other language systems are way more money. I would suggest getting some supplimental materials too, like 501 Portuguese Verbs, and Essential Portuguese Grammar to really flesh it out."
1,Very Thin and easily torn,I have used a few different types of Radiant Barrier and this is definitely the most fragile. You have to be very careful with it to prevent it from tearing. It is just slightly stronger than normal aluminum foil.My favorite so far out of what I have used is RA-Flect Radiant Barrier. It is far stronger.
4,nice router to have,make sense to buy this router considering it's price..but at times the connection gets lost...otherwise it's pretty good
1,Had to replug it every time I used it,"My wife, my 10 year old, and my 6 year old, ALL know how to reset a wireless router because we had to do it 3-4 times a day with this one. Our Netflix shows would stop playing because of this router. My company webinars would get interrupted. Finally recycled it and bought a better one.Save your time and money and buy a better quality product."
1,Tenuous Connection,"Right out of the box this router had trouble establishing a consistent connection at any range. Every 5 minutes or so I have to repair the connection, which thankfully can be done laptop-side, but these outages make streaming and chatting impossible.I did turn off Protection (from Auto to ""Off"") as was suggested in another review (just navigate to 192.168.2.1 and go to the SSID page), but unfortunately that didn't work for me. I understand that the way the router deals with encryption is potentially the source of the issue, but I am not going to remove security from my network.Bottom line, pay $30 for a Belkin router and you are playing router roulette. Sadly, I bet on Black and it came up Red this time. I'm here on Amazon right now to buy a different router, and probably spend a bit more money on a Netgear or Linksys this time."
2,Drops connection,"This thing drops connections a little too frequently to be of much use. Sometimes it drops the connections 3-4 times in a day. Earlier it was dropping connections and hanging a bit more frequently. Then I read somewhere that the base of the router gets very hot, which makes it drop connections and become useless. So I now keep it tilted to increase air-flow. That has helped a bit.Because of this router, I think I am using my neighbors network more often than mine. I think I should ask her what router she has :-)"
4,"Quick, easy, reliable","The router was extremely easy to setup, just like any other wired router, truly plug and play. The range is exceptionally good, with little sound interference and a constant broadcast of the full 54Mbps speed. The wired and wireless compatibility of this router makes it very versatile and convenient. The affordable price makes this router an excellent value. The only downside to the unit is the size, it seems unnecessarily bulky."
2,this thing will ruin your weekend,Buy this router if:a. You are a network engineerb. You wrote the setup softwarec. You plan on being luckyd. Your life is so dismal that a weekend spent chatting with the nice ladies in Hyderabad is the best you can hope for!
2,Not getting Belkin the next time.,"It's not exactly the cheapest out there but the router failed on me a couple of times. It has intermittent signal issues. At first I thought maybe it's the location so I moved it around.Then one day, I couldn't find it on the wireless network. Spoke to tech support and after 2 hrs, they decided to send a new one.Here's the thing. YOU, as the consumer, have to pay shipping cost for shipping back the defective unit. Tech support never mentioned a word about it. I got mad about it. Why am I responsible for paying to ship a defective product?After wasting much time with the customer service, they finally sent me a shipping label.Besides that this Belkin router lacks an information manual. It has a quick-start leaflet and that's about it. There are no information on how to change the internal settings using hard wiring and an IP address.Not buying Belkin ever again."
1,Big Disappointment,"This thing was a huge disappointment. It worked for about 15 minutes, then conked out. Waste of money, don't buy."
5,very pleased,this router works perfectly sending & receiving signals from it's downstairs locations to upstairs where i typically use my laptop....quick & easy setup
2,Typical low cost junk,"Firstly, while my model number is the same, I don't have the 2nd antenna. It works, but decently at best. Frequently drops the conenction while I'm in the middle of something. I also now need to reboot my cable modem every few days. Range is laughably bad. Move 10 feet, it drops in half. I can work in the bedroom, about 25 feet away, at the lowest connection speed. Back yard, ferget it. I am using the Belkin wireless adapter that supposedly goes with it, either both or one is garbage. Configuration interface is fine, nothing great, not really geared for computer-phobes, but nothing terrible. I would say spend the extra bucks and get something better, this is a pretty frustrating piece of junk."
1,Really unstable and full o features that won't work,"I had this router working mediocre for like a year, it sometimes stops working but you just need to restart it, I had to do this twice a week.It suddenly stopped working for some devices including my mother's Nokia N8 which will refuse a connection but it worked for my iPhone so I went and I decided to bypass all its features and use it as an access point, it worked fine for a while.Finally it got worst two weeks ago, I tried everything but nothing works, next time I will go with an more expensive router and save myself some pain."
1,Worthless,"This router NEVER works and is always slow. I've had it for several months, and I am constantly starting and restarting it. A complete waste of money."
3,"belkin wireless G, some issues.",I have this installed and often I have to reboot the thing to get it to work. A tech frind of mine says I should have went with a LINKSYS. I just may do that.
1,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible!!","Don't plan on being able to do much of anything online with this wireless router. It jumps on and off the internet, the signal is constantly coming and going, and no, it was not the cable modem, it was this router. It stinks, what a waste of money!"
2,misleading label,"This is nothing more than an old-fashioned router, fairly slow and hyped in a way implying it is a cable (gateway) modem - it may do what a router is supposed to do, but JR/Amazon is not quite honest in how it is presented."
2,Good for DSL Bad for Cable,When I got this router I initially had a dsl connection and it worked great with 5 computers using it at the same time. When I switched to a cable connection it seemed to drop signal every few minutes. I am a gamer and it is so frustrating to get disconnected so often from losing your connection. Just to check the router itself I took it to a friend's home who had dsl and again it works great...go figure. So I am back to using my extremely long ethernet cord to connect my laptop.....sigh.
2,Lonely Planet Hawaii,This book has a pretty cover but I found I had to squint to much to read it in places. I was looking for newer information.
3,Time for an update,"At this point, this edition is 3 years old, and some of the listings in it are outdated. The combination of recession (and drought) and rapid change, together with the influx of new residents moving in from the mainland, have made the Big Island change quite a bit. Some of the businesses listed in the book no longer exist, and some newer ones do.I'll be happy to remove this review when a new edition comes out. A recent review says it's due in October -- can someone alert me when it's available? Thanks."
3,Not going to be a favorite,"We are planning our second trip to Hawaii, first time to The Big Island. I found this book poorly organized for someone who had NO clue about this particular island.I was suprised to find the ""Planning Your Trip"" section located in the back of the book, versus first thing. The maps seemed small and hard to navigate for someone unfamiliar with the island. I also would've liked to have seen more options for accomodations listed with more detailed descriptions.I did appreciate that the book is color coded based on the area of the island. I just was looking for more of a clear idea of what made each area unique and worth visiting, especially since they mention that The Big Island is too big to conquer all of it. They DO offer island itineraries, as in ""in 3 days"", ""in 5 days"", etc.My search continues for guides on The Big Island!"
2,All stop!,"Didn't do a thing for me. Not enough variety, and not enough about the Columbia/Snake River boats and their jobs. Here's a concept...why not have somebody who KNOWS what they're talking about, write about tugs. Hmmmmmmmmm, I'd buy that one too!"
4,A Good Year,"Loved the movie and the music. Sadly, some of the best music from the movie was not included in the soundtrack but it's still excellent. I play it all the time. Just a fun CD that puts me in great mood.Love it!"
3,GLARING OMISSION,"There Are Some Nice tunes on here , but leaving off a show stopper like BOUM was a CRIME!!There are at least three cuts on this soundtrack that could of easily been cut out to make room for more relevant and much better songs. What were they thinking ? Me thinks what songs someone had a piece of."
3,"Agreed, it lacked a few",I have the soundtrack and downloaded the extra music that wasn't on it and combined it all on a burned cd.
4,fun mix of French music,My husband lived in France for a year and speaks it well. We both loved this soundtrack because it's got a great mix of different kinds of French songs. Really sets a mood and background.
4,Required Reading,"This book marks significant breakthrough in the research and treatment of distortions and addictions related to sex, romance, fantasy, relationships, and culture. Schaef offers clear structures for identifying relational dysfunction, patterns, and the addictive cycle - from ""anorexic"" behavior to a variety of forms of acting-out. Written in frank, laymen's terms, this is a must-read for anyone in the helping profession, in recovery, or seeking to address questions about intimacy. The author does not just present much-needed distinctions between relationship and pseudo-relationship, but she offers keys for real intimacy in the battle against addictive cycles. This is now required reading for my clients and recovery groups."
1,Would lnot buy again,I would not buy this hose again. I bought 2 and both of them leaked the very first time I used them.
1,Leaks,"I bought this to water my plants on the patio of my small apt. I bought an adapter and hooked it up to my faucet and ran it though the apt to the patio. Turned on the water, all was fine, watered the plants. Upon entering the apt to shut off the water I discovered two leaks spraying water all over the walls, pictures, etc. and puddling on the carpet. I am not happy! http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KL5A72/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
5,Fabulous!,Very fast service. Exactly what I wanted and it was delivered extremely fast. I'm HAPPY and so is the grandma I ordered it for.
1,what a joke,"Reel in handle broke. Please do not buy this product. Used two times.made off plastic,should off known better.what a joke."
5,Every child in school should have one.,"Great book, Gives lots of interesting facts. Book came in record time... No complaints. This should be given to every child in school when they start American history."
1,PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU BUY,"The item listed is not you'll receive, I tried 2 different sellers and recieved different item than described. Ultimate Self Pleasure or something to effect is more than likely what you'll get. If you really want Erotic Centerfolds my recommendation is to go to TLA.com. I don't know if it is Amazon error or sellers error on this."
2,They use GMO...too bad,I love this product hoever I contacted the company and they told me that they use GMO ingredients. I think specifically the oil they use.Tnat 's it I have stopped using it!
2,We don't like them....,"I ordered these based on the reviews on this site, and recommendations by other parents of GFCF childen. I really wanted to like them, but my son will not eat them. I was going for a somewhat healthy, yet tasty snack, and these are not working. They are far too greasy, not tasty enough for us, and not healthy."
2,"These are not ""veggies.""","There's a slightly odd taste about this product that I can't figure out from the ingredients. These are not a substitute for veggies as some people reviewing seem to think. They're basically a potato chip replacement and just as unhealthy but slightly lower in fat. These are definitely ""junk food"" and should be eaten with that in mind in terms of frequency and quantity. The fact that they're called peas is only because they're molded to look like peas. Read the label!I won't order them again mainly because of the weird off-putting taste."
5,I like 'em,They are salty (but not too much so) and crunchy and have a sufficient amount of nutrition. I don't waste them on salads--just eat them right out of the bag. They shipped quickly and had a good expiration date from Amazon.
5,Best ever yummy,"I enjoy these tremendously--they are a reasonably healthy snack compared with most. How can you go wrong with a veggie? Remember your mother's admonition to eat your peas :) They are truly very tasty, in spite of being peas..."
5,Too delicious! Too much sodium!,I LOVED these delicious little crunchy treats until I checked the sodium content!I still loved snacking on them BUT I can't for my health's sake. I gave most of the little delicious treats away away to friends without the sodium caution I have to watch.Oh my....they are good!
3,I prefer Original,"I love Snapea Crisps original but only 'like' the Caesar flavored variety, which taste tangy to me (compared to original)."
1,individual packages were not sealed,Several of the bags were not sealed and had to be thrown away. Poor quality packaging. Won't buy again.
4,a lot of work,This takes quit a long time and lots of little nuts and bolts to assemble. But you do have a minor sense of accomplishment when it is finally done.
5,John Kay: aka Steppenwolf,"After Steppenwolf, lead singer John Kay embarked on a solo career thattook him into blues, country and folk. Having some of his former bandmatesbacking him up didn't hurt. I had the original album. Had to get the cd!"
3,Versatile but made of cheaper materials,"This bassinet appears to be made of quality materials from the photo and description, but the bassinet section actually is made of cardboard, despite a review to the contrary. However, the cardboard is relatively sturdy and adequate for the purpose - holding your baby for the early weeks/months. The toybox base is made of lower-quality particle board that is painted and the paint job on ours was not very good -- there are lumps of paint, streaks, and other imperfections. The versatility of this unit makes it worthwhile compared to other bassinets, but it is slightly overpriced for the quality of the workmanship. It is not something that will last very long."
1,unable to assemble,"I purchased this bassinet for my daughter (who has not been born yet) and I still am unable to get past step one. I am usually very good about assembling items and am stumped on this. When I go to put the screws in, they stick out and will not screw all the way in. I contacted the manufacturing and they were extremely unhelpful. I am returning this for a different model. I would have given this item no stars if that was an option. Save your money and sanity and don't purchase this bassinet"
4,Worth the money,"This bassinet , is worth every penny. Your baby will fall asleep in this adorable and sturdy bassine."
1,It fell apart with my daughter in it,"This bassinet was a waste of money. After tax and shipping it cost over $100. I registered online and did not see it in person. From the moment I put it together it did not live up to my expectations. It does NOT have lights, sound, or vibrations. But the worst part was that it was falling apart from the beginning. It started with one wheel that always fell apart when it was moved, then another wheel. Then, a little while later it became very whobbly. Then, one night, with my 2 month old daughter inside, the frame completly fell to pieces. Thankfully, the top part where my daughter was sleeping is seperate and just fell flat on the ground. If you are looking for a crade or bassinet, I would not choose this one. I have seen countless other cradles that are cuter, and of better quality, and even cheaper, that I wish I could have gotten, but I've already wasted my money on this one."
5,EXIT COUNSELING,This book underscores some of the therapeutic methods of exit counseling. I like the way the author breaks down the way cults work. However he should spend less time speaking about his own experiences and channel on the experiences of others within the field.
3,Review on Fortune,"Fortune captured my attention from the beginning, however if you are an avid reader and devour books the way I do, you begin to see a pattern. Story lines begin to waver and take on similar plots to other novels or start with a bang and end with a whimper. I feel the author of Fortune could have added more twists and turns when the main character unknowingly returned to her family, elaborated and used the main characters mother more in the story line and added more action when ending the novel."
4,"Multitalented Bakula ""Quantum Leaps""over other ""stars""","Although I get quite a few disbeliving looks at the presence of this CD in my collection, the versatility of Scott Bakula far outweighs other considerations. The tunes compiled from the series show the extreme range of styles this talented performer is capable of. Just as he was able to believably play so many characters on the series, his ability to embrace a variety of musical styles brings to mind the stars of Hollywood's heyday who did it all. Too bad this is the only disc available to enjoy by this multitalented entertainer."
4,A good book,I bought this book for a collage class and I found it very easy to read and self explanitory. If you need a book for Turbo then this book would be a good one.
1,I read this book for English class...,"When my English teacher went to assign us our new book, we all knew which book it was going to be since other classes had had them.Now everyone hears of this book saying how it helped them to become someone, or rather, find out who they were. I read this book for one reason-to get a good grade in English.Jerry Spinelli has written good books, don't get me wrong, but Stargirl was basically taking the stereotypical idea of ""the new kid in school"" and twisting it in a way to which the girl was this odd person out of the blue.Never mind the fact that Leo, the narrator, and his best friend (whom I have forgotten the name of), sound very immature. They're supposed to be well into high school, but they sound like 7th graders.I was very disappointed when I read this book as I expected something more out of it than what I got."
1,Boring Star Girl,"Teen's that are out there and wont's to read a good book,wellthis book is not meent for you,let ne tell you why.well inthe book there is a part where star girl comes popular but sherun's away .i thought that part was boring cause almost every on wonts to be popular ""but that's my opinon.""also in the middle there is a part where there in the lunch roomwith a hot seat "" It means a t.v show at there school."" It makesit boring cause who would watch t.v in the lunch room.Star girl is a book i just dis liked on .she really did not have a memory,and she did not flash back at all ,also shereally didnt talk about her parent's. I would change itto make it more fun and really not that boring. I wouldrecommend this book to any one who likes character'sthat mostley talk about them selfs."
3,What emotions does Stargirl feel?,"There's no doubt that I would have desired to have a friend in Stargirl, to have her sing to me on my birthday as she strummed her ukele. We never really meet her though. We never directly know her joys, her disappointments. We are only allowed to assume what she feels when she leads the bunny hop, when she is slapped afterwards. And Leo is so unsatisfying because he doesn't really do anything. He merely allows Stargirl to flirt with him while he is embarrased about it."
1,Stargirl Review,"The book Stargirl is a book that I would recommend if you like books that are about people that don't fit in. I thought that if the author had added more things to explain what was going on I would have been more interesting. All throughout the book, I thought that if he added more details, the book might have caught me more. I think that it was a good book but not a book I would purchase and read over again."
3,Stargirl,StargirlStar girl a book by Jerry Spinelli is a pretty good book and it's about a girl who comes to Arizona and meets all these people she is made fun of because she's different then all the other people. On valentines day she gives this kid Leo Borlock a valentines card and she walks up to him and he gets so embarrassed because the weirdo (stargirl) walks up to him and says thank you for the card. Leo and star girl later on go out with each other and everybody hates Leo and Stargirl. I'll leave the rest for you to figure out!I liked the book star girl because it was a good book. It left me full of guesses that I wanted to figure out. If you like books that make you guess than I would highly suggest for you to get this book. Some of the parts were funny actually.
4,Good book!!!,"We are in a book club at a school in New York. We read Stargirl and this is our personal opinion:We liked Stargirl because she is creative and extraordinary.Some of us liked the ending because the school changed for the better because of her. Others didn't like it because she moved away.We would recommend this book to kids from the age of 9-14,5."
5,An Enchanting Book,"Stargirl was so real it hurts. If you want to read a book that is about life and living and being exactly who you are no matter what, then this is the book. Stargirl seemed to be unreal at first because you can not understand how it is possible that she acts like she does, giving no thought to herself or her own needs. She seems like some sort of martyr or saint. However, as the book progresses, you learn that not only is she human, but she also has the same feelings as humans. She hurts, she's selfish, and she wants to be loved. The thing that makes her different is her ability to overcome these human emotions and love the way humans are really meant to, uncondionally and without selfishness. This story teaches you to not be afraid of who you are on the inside. It teaches you to love and live and appreciate everything for what it really is."
4,"*~An ""a little better than fairly reasonable"" book!~*","I was suprised to see that ""Stargirl"" was told by a boy and the way it started out I wasn't quite sure I like it. But it really was quite a good read.I felt like I could easily relate to the actions of the student body to the every day life at school that I experience. (Popularity and all) It wasn't the BEST book I have ever read but it is, however, close to the top of the list. You should read it because it is well worth your time."
3,Stargirl,The book I read was called Stargirl. I thought that it was a good book. It was about this new girl at school named Stargirl who everyone thinks is really weird. She plays her ukelele at lunch every day and sings people happy birthday. That is one of the reasons they think she is weird. Another reason is because she always dresses in these weird clothes. She also starts to have a crush on the main charactor named Leo. I would reccomend this book to teenagers. I would because anybody younger then that wouldn't understand the book. Then anybody older then that probably wouldn't like the book. I enjoyed this book and I know you would too. So I recommend that you read this book.
3,It's crazy like a monkey!,"I thought this was onew crazy book-I started to like it at the first chapter then I didn't really like it at the end! Stargirl was at the boys basketball game and the other team made a point and Stargirl cheered for the other team! Why would someone cheer for the other team? that Stargirl wrote on a sign Stargirl loves Leo and I wouldn't write that on a sign that I love someone. That Cinnimnion is a rat and he likes to talk to Stargirl and all of her friends. My favorite character is Stargirl and I dislike her because she is crazy. she likes Leo,but doesn't want him to know she wrote it on a sign. Stargirl was really weird because she did weird things and had no reasons to be weird. I would change that Stargirl isn't that crazy because I don't like the crazy girl. I would recommend this book to age's 9-12 years old because this is the crazy age and this book is crazy."
3,Its iffy.,"Well although I did enjoy reading the book stargirl I find that this book is way to ""made-up"" I don't believe people really act or do the things that StarGirl did. Not only would she never have made it in the real world doing the things she did. People would give her a hardtime through out the way. On the other hand I did enjoy reading the book. I thought she was a great character and this really made me think about the ""clique's"" in school and how people really did act like these people sometimes. I just didn't think it was very realistic."
4,stargirl,"Stargirl is a ""different"" type of book. Jerry Spinelli wrote this book to make it so that stargirl, as she calls herself, seems to be a different person, but in a unique way. She comes to Mica High where she grasps everyone's attention by being a ""cool"" girl. She caught Leo Borlock's eye with just one smile. He and everyone else in the crowd really liked her, everything about her. At the beginning. Then everyone's opinion was changed when a few incidents occurred. Leo didn't know what to do, go with the crowd or go with his crush. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys really good books. From when you pick up the book and look at the cover until when you finish the book you will enjoy. I think Spinelli wrote the book because she wants to tell people it is okay to be different. People will think it is ""cool"" to be different. So be the person that you are inside and don't change your self for anyone!"
4,stargirl,"Stargirl is a ""differant"" type of book. Jerry Spinelli wrote this book to make it so that stargirl, as she calls herself, seems to be a different person, but in a unique way. She come to Mica High where she grasps everyones attention by being a ""cool"" girl. She caught Leo Borlock's eye with just one smile. He and everyone else in the crowd really liked her, everything about her. At the beginning. Then everyones opinion was changed when a few incidents occured. Leo didnt know what to do, go with the crowd or go with his crush. Stargirl is a ""awesome"" book. It grabs your attention. Just looking at the cover makes you interested as to what is going ot happen"
2,This book stinks,It's a fantasy in disguise. I am homeschooled and I disagree completely and a lot of people who had to read this for school now treat me differently because of the stereotype Stargirl creates for homeschoolers.
4,stargirl sumare,"Stargirl by: Jerry Spinelli is an adventure in a book. This Acton / adventure will leap out of the pages and in to your imagination.In this story Stargirl Caraway moves to Arizona and in to mica high school and fastly becomes the most popular student in mica high school. While meeting new friends during her journey including her pet rat cinnamon, Leo, Kevin and many more characters that you have to read the book to find out about.Personally I would give this book out of five stars I would give it a four stars because of the halerius seince in this great store that would make a great gift."
3,Section 3,"Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli is a book about a girl named Suzan Caraway who later gets the name Stargirl who is new at Mica High, in Arizona, and doesn't seem to fit in. Everyone in school thinks she is weird. On the first day of school she brings her ukulele and starts to play on top of a table in the cafeteria. When she goes to sporting events she cheers for both Mica High and the opposing team. One time the cheerleaders from Mica High played a trick on Stargirl and told her that they forgot something in the gym and asked her if she could go get it. They told the bus driver that everyone was on board, so they took off. Lucky for Stargirl the janitor said he would drive her home.I recommend this book for anyone who likes to read comical/amusing books. If I would rate this book I would rate it a two out of five. I don't care for this book much though because I like action, adventure, and mystery books better."
1,this is some krap,this book is a peaces of do do i dont even think you should get this freak people book. who ever read this book is a freak them selves.dont get this book. its a wast of your precouise money
4,"What it's like to be that ""weird"" girl","Well, that was unexpected.I found myself dealing with my own discomfort and prejudices as I read this novel: like the ""normal"" kids in the story, I wanted Stargirl to be less...weird.(And can't you just picture someone like Luna Lovegood as the quirky girl who does her own thing and doesn't care about what others think? Oh, wait...)Even though I wanted her to be normal, I was really sad when Stargirl changed who she was, just so she could fit in. I wanted to tell her to be herself! That it wasn't worth it and that she was wonderful just as she was!Spinelli did a great job portraying what it's like to be an outsider during those sometimes-awful teenage years.I highly recommend this book for young teens who are dealing with peer pressure and popularity issues."
5,Awesome Book!,"It's an awesome book about this girl who has her own identity and isn't afraid of being different. She questions things which society percieves as normal, which isn't!"
4,Jerry Spinelli is a great author and this book is a great one too,"I like this book because anyone or any school could relate to this, every class or grade has that weird person or outgoing one. In my grade, their are a lot of those kind if people. I would have gave this book a rating of 5 stars but in parts it just dragged on."
2,stargirl review,Star girl reviewStar girl was a great book. It was about a girl who moved and went to a different school. Most of the kids didn't like her and some didn't believe she was real. She plays the ukulele in the cafeteria. Star girl is a nice girl and funny. She got lots of friends and got popular because she went to football games and she joined clubs.I thought star girl wasn't that great of a book because I don't like to read. But I liked how the author gave star girl friends and stuff. It tells you what it feels like to be left out
3,Stargirl,"Stargirl is about a girl who goes to a public school for the first time and sticks out like a sore thumb. In the book she becomes very popular, but things go wrong and she is hated by everyone. Meantime she falls in love with Leo Borlock, but Leo tries to make her change which she does. Later on in the book She changes back to who she was. There is a lot more that happens, but you'll have to fnd out. My favorite part in the book is when she no longer tries to be someone else. This happen shortly after the compition she went back to her old clothes.From the books I've read in the past I would have to say this wasn't my favorite, but I don't hate it. One reason I don't like this book is because it never leaves you hanging you can always figure out what is going to happen. One thing I do like about this book is that it point out that you should always be yourself. This is only my opinion so you'll have to find out for yourself."
4,"Pocket mouse, Stargirl, Susan..........","Pocket mouse no, Stargirl is a very werid girl, she sings songs in the lunchroom and do all kinds of werid things. People in this high school don't like her. But when she and Leo starts liking each other, Leo tried to make her change into a NORMAL girl, she did. But peoples still hates her, so at last after the school dance no one had ever seen her anymore."
4,Thrilling,The Book Star Girl by Jerry Spinelli us a great book it is thrilling and shows you cruel and mean ways of high school students just because they see a new type of person who dresses different and basically doesnt go with the flow... This is a great book on how one girl can change people and i reccomend it to anyone.
5,Stargirl,"The characters in this wonderful story jump out of the book, bypass your brain and go straight to your heart. Leo, the narrator feels very much like every high school student must feel, and it is portrayed perfectly in the text. Every single experience he has rings true, from his good moments to the ones where, if he were standing before me I would have punched him square in the mouth.The title character Stargirl Caraway is an amazing bouncing creative individual in a mass of conforming teenagers. She wears outrageous outfits but not because they are revealing or shocking, because they hold more personality than all of the clothing in the school could dream of. She takes the school by storm, but after the storm passes there is trouble.http://dailylitmajor.blogspot.com/2008/08/stargirl-by-jerry-spinelli.html"
4,Good coming-of-age novel,"A very good coming-of-age novel written entirely from a kid's point of view. We rarely even hear about adults - except of course for Archie, the leader of the Loyal Order of the Stone Bone - and he's certainly not portrayed as a ""typical"" adult. I think that's what I liked best about this book... never once was it condescending - as books with adult characters often are. It was a bit unrealistic, but enjoyable with good characters. You can see bits and pieces of yourself reflected in all of the characters. And most importantly it made me think...."
4,What a Great Book!!!!,"I rated this book 4 stars becuase this book is a great learning Experiance. It tought me that i need to treat people with respect because even if they are the person that you hate the most they still have feelings. The Author ""Jerry Spinelli"" was trying to make a point, well he made it. This book had me wanting more when i was finished i wanted to read it again thats how involed i got into this book! I recommed this book to anyone who wants a good book to read while waiting because whatever your waiting for couldn't be more interesting than this book. Read it!!!"
2,Here's what I think.,"""Stargirl"" by Jerry Spinelli was a very typical book. If I were to rate it on a scale from one to ten, I would have to give it a five for effort. While the moral of this story is a good one, I think that it is over used. Yes, unconditional love and acceptance are important, but this moral is played out in too many plots in books today. I also felt that Stargirl's character was a bit extreme. Her character did not seem realistic to me. She is overly individualistic, and in comparison to the people in the world today, I had a hard time taking her seriously.I felt like the characters were rapidly developed and more time could have been spent developing their personalities. I don't know that I would reccomend this book to a friend for any special reason. The book is not exactly unique in any particular way. The story is cute, but I think that this author would have much better success with a story line that is not so cliche."
5,Authentic story for middle school/high school boys & girls,"I teach 8th English. I had heard that this book was good, but frankly, I had heard that about other so-called ""young adult"" books before and had been disappointed by the amount of vulgar scenes and sexual themes. This one is different. The story is told from a high school boy's point of view, which is refreshing. The book was a fast read for me, not only because of its length and easy readability, but also because of my fascination with Stargirl's character and the boy's reaction to her. It clearly addresses peer pressure, a topic that every teenager deals with on a daily basis. I live in a small rural town, and this book aptly describes the benefits and disadvantages of living in a goldfish bowl. I also love how the author deals with the idea of ""acts of random kindness."" This is a book that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to the pickiest of any parents for their middle school son or daughter."
1,Disappointed...,"I have the expanded version of Jessica's ""In This Skin"" album. The reason I bought this single was for the unreleased track ""Fly"". In my opinion, it wasn't really worth it. ""Fly"" sounds sort of like a cross between the song ""Everyday See You"" (from ""In This Skin"") and early Mandy Moore songs from her ""So Real"" album. So, if you like that particular song or album, you'll love ""Fly"". But if you don't like your pop music to sound overly cheesy, pass on this single!"
2,This song was...,"Berlin was a cool band in the eighties. ""The Metro"" is still one of my favorite songs. ""Take my breath away"" finished them off as a group and was an overbearing, schmaltzy mess back ""in the day"". A remake by one of the cynical ""buff gold"" blonde pop queens of modern times is fitting. I don't have anything against pop music, but some songs are just too much. One aspect I did like was the warbley fretless [synth?] bass. The songs only redeeming feature."
1,Sounds Cheaply Done,"The original Berlin version sounds actually more modern than this version, with newer and more hi end instruments."
3,Praxis I Review,"I like the writing assessments they have....however, the book doesn't have enough sample tests! I still had to go via other sources to get more practice! Naviagation of the book is diffcult with respect to self-assessment and if you can determine the proability of how well you will perform on the Praxis Level One Exam. I would have liked an additional software program or CD-ROM with multiple tests. Like Stanely Kaplan...where it actually tells you your weakness and what you concentration of study should be!"
4,Variety Lights,"Ambitious dancer uses the horny goat leader of a 4th-rate vaudeville troupe to further her career, but ends up a small fish in a bigger pond. Fellini's 1st movie (in tandem w/ more experienced director Lattuada) is Fellini-esque from the very 1st scene: dutch angles, grotesque close-ups, etc. Giulietta Masina plays trademark doormat w/ a heart o' gold right off the bat as well. No masterpiece, but breezy fun. 7/10"
2,"Typical Timex: keeps ticking, but cheap.","Timer does turn lamp on/off when supposed to. But when you try to remove from tight outlet, it feels like the timer is about to pull apart in two pieces in your hand. Next time I am going for an Intermatic or something more solid."
3,Meh,"It arrived kind of warn. If I could find the programming connector in my car, it'd be great...but no such luck as of yet. I'm sure it will work fine once I find what I need to find."
5,Remote,"Worked like the original once programmed,and the directions to do this were easy to find and perform,bottom line is i,m happy with purchase."
4,"Warm air, works well",I'm now using this humidifier for a 2nd winter and it has worked well for me. I have a bigger humidifier that puts out cold air and is not nearly as comfortable. This humidifier is pretty easy to maintain with no filters to keep buying.
4,"So far, so good","We've had this up and running for a week and we just checked the liquid catch and there are tons of insects in it. It's hard to see how many of them are mosquitos as a large number of them are moths and other flying insects. The device advertises only attracting biting insects, but they advise turning of the LED feature if you find too many non-biting insects in it- which we may end up doing.There does seem to be less mosquitoes assaulting us every time we step outside so far, but I think we'll see the true effectiveness in the next month or so.I was under the impression that this came with the CO2 attractant feature, but that is purchased separately. Our mistake, just be aware!So far, so good though. I think I will be very happy with our purchase ultimately!"
2,not very comfortable,i bought these headphones thinking they would be more comfortable because of what other people told me. But since i have cartilidge piercings they were not comfortable at all!
3,It's a tongue twister of incredible size,"I enjoyed trying to read these selections...it made me laugh and those trying to understand me laugh also. I gave the book to a 10 year old, who memorized one story and plans to present it at a speech contest. It makes interesting entertainment for those who master the spoolerisms and lots of fun for those who listen...."
1,"Trash, Hank Crawford ""Help me Make it Through the Night""","With the backup ofsome of the best sidemen in the business, whoever produced this album has produced one of the worst soul jazz albums I've come across. I gave it two complete listens and it now sits promenently on my pile of give-aways.It didn't even make it to my pile of traders. String sections can sometimes add to the quality of music, but on this album they don't belong. A terrible album by a good player.Stay away from it."
5,Pure genius!,"This song is pure genius, like all the music made by Mike Score. He could have been a great classical music composer but he decided to rock our world instead. He the king of new wave with Bowie and the Thompson Twins!"
3,"Outdated, but okay for Sandra","Definitely an outdated book culture-wise (some parts really bothered me). But, if you can get past that, it's a good, easy read. Victim falls in love with kidnapper. Nice scenes, and I liked both of the characters. Very unbelievable by today's standards, but, it's fiction so what-the-heck."
3,Quality just ok,I expected a little better quality for the money I paid. My son liked it so that is really what matters!
3,Fun to dip into.,"Trivia and quiz buffs will find much to satisfy them here. You can discover which was the first car to have airconditioning or how many rooms there are at Buckingham palace. There's a good deal of original material, too, which has not found its way into the general literature. But buyers need to be aware there is a strong US bias in many of the sections. Last reprinted in 1998, there is not much material specifically relevant to the last ten years or so. This gives some of the chapers a dated look, for example on the cinema or TV. Inevitably there are some moot points. The original sources, for instance, are not unanimous that Attila the Hun died of a nose bleed (he may have been murdered). But if you like quick fire question and answer sessions, you will certainly get hooked on this book."
5,The World's Gardens On Your Coffee Table,"What an excellent publication! This compilation of exquisite garden photos is a must have for any home owner or gardening enthusiast. Gardens Around the World: 365 Days is worth every penny of its full retail price, Amazon's deeply discounted price makes it a steal. Don't pass this one by! Your guests will quickly grab hold of this well bound book to see which gardens are featured on thier birthday, anniversaries, etc."
2,A Missed Opportunity,"How could a documentary about the beautiful Pere Lachaise cemetery ever go wrong? This filmmaker manages to make a botch of something that could have been quite stunning. She inexplicably spends most of the film on Marcel Proust and Frederic Chopin, and mostly ignores the other famous residents of this cemetery. There are some fine moments with everyday people as they tend the graves of their beloved family members--I wish the filmmaker had done more of this. I was really looking forward to this movie, but was extremely disappointed. Perhaps Ms.Honigmann should have entitled her film ""Marcel Proust's Grave."""
1,Don't buy kindle version!,"The guide itself is a typical lonely planet, my only word of advice, DON""T BUY IT FOR KINDLE. Normally I would buy the paperback for a guide, but I live in Japan and its too expensive, so I chose Kindle. The formatting is horrible, you can't read any of the maps, none of the pictures display properly, and so on.On Lonely Planet's website they sell pdfs that are about the same price (or half the price if you catch them on sale) and the formatting and display is world's better.I really wish I could get money back on this and buy the Lonely Planet electronic version."
1,Worst Book I Have Ever Tried to Read,"I have read about 50 books on money management, trading, and investing. Every book up until this one provided little gold nuggets of information to help my investing. This book was so difficult to read it was like from another world. Here is an example of what you will find in the book:Data envelopment analysis, a mathematical programming approach, was first developed by Charnes, to measure the efficiency or performance of individual decision-making units (DMU's) in producing multiple outputs from multiple inputs. Unlike a parametric approach, which requires the researcher to make sometimes arbitrary assumptions about the functional... You get the drift.Anyway this book was a complete waste of money. I kick myself for not doing proper research before spending my $55. The book is not helpful in selecting a CTA. The only thing this book is good for is starting a fire. I will put it with my camping stuff and use it for that purpose."
5,Dreams the language of the soul.,"I have long wondered what some of my dreams meant at times they are silly, frightening, and mysterious at other times profound. I had not been taught how to interpret their meaning. Dr. Estes has again deciphered the magic that lies within. Our dreams guides to where we are in soul development, she explains the method to unraveling the messages we receive nightly. I have read so many books on dreams and did not feel much enlightened at the end. So many books just give standard meaning descriptions some from so long ago they did not have the same meaning to me. In these two tapes so much is explained in a way so easy to understand that the work she did in this area is brilliant. I recommended them to anyone who desires to know thyself better."
4,Great David Sanbord CD,"If you are looking for a driving guitar and awesome saxaphone, this terrific jazz album is for you. This one of the first albums by then jazz session artist David Sanborn.I give this a solid 4 stars."
3,The star Wars Music was horrible!!,"I only prewiewed the star wars music sample, but it sounded nothing like the real star wars music. Too fast and high pitched. But the tune was right."
3,Same as Swim Cap,"I got this for my 18mo who had tubes put in for ear infections and takes swim class. It works well with putty first in the ears, but I ended up putting a swim cap over both as well. Now we just end up putting the swim cap on and not even using the band-it. Gave it 3 stars because it is ok and works but a swim cap works better for my purpose."
3,Ear Band,I didn't realize when I purchased this that ear plugs were also supposed to be worn with this product. I bought the product so my son didn't have to wear earplugs. I use it without earplugs and it works pretty good for the most part.
2,Great product but child can easily remove hence it doesn't work for babies,My son won't let me put this on him and he can easily take it off the rare times I succeed in getting it in him....he had tube surgery and the doc recommended these....they are really well built and I will purchase when he's old enough to know not to take them off (he is a year now)
2,"Addled, confusing, no point","The author may have an interesting message somewhere, but who could find it? The writing is convoluted, the author is wallowing in his self-loathing, and with no apparent goal in mind. I don't care if the author hates the fact that he's a man. I want to read about genetics, dang it!I find the topic fascinating, but I couldn't get through more than the first two or three chapters... I don't even remember how far I got, because it all just swam together (on the page, not just in my mind).I was hoping to find another book to complement The X in Sex, but this book just makes me ask ""Y?"" -- as in ""Y should I read this rubbish?"" Thank heavens for libraries."
2,Translates Terribly to the Screen,"I'm not simply just hating on this. I am a huge fan of the stage show - and actually just wrapped a series of sold-out performance back in May. I was ecstatic this was finally coming out and preordered it day one.Unfortunately, it's pretty awful. They for some reason felt like the show itself wasn't good enough so they added a bunch of terribly 1980's effects like bubbles, sparkles, and giant plungers. Quite possibly the biggest travesty is that they did not sing live, and some of the clips do not include the live audience. How can THIS show be done with LIP SYNCHING?And though it is cool that the original cast returns, a lot of them are on the tired sides of their careers, and just don't sound as good as they used to.Overall, this is an incredibly disappointing release. If they would have just set a static camera on the stage and taped the entire show it'd probably be a 10/10..."
3,"ok condition, but..","The book is in acceptable condition for having been used, though I didn't like that some of the exercises were already done (and not correctly actually).Beside this I cannot complain."
1,No Thanks,"I bought this timer for my fish tank light. For the first couple of months, i had no problems with it, but recently, i've noticed QUITE frequently that the light would not come on, or turn off. Upon closer inspection of the timer, i noticed that the time was not moving. i would go to bed at night, with it set to 1130, and in the morning, it was still 1130 pm - hadn't moved AT ALL. i would fix the time and the light would come on, and when i would get home from work, i would check it again, and guess what? it was still 8 am, sometimes it would have made it to noon, or some other afternoon hour, but it's never the right time. i realize it only costs $7, but my recommendation is to go with a different brand...preferably one that works!!"
3,"Cute, but not quiet.","This Timex Timer certainly works, and it's pretty dang cute as these things go, but it is SO not silent. This thing sounds like the ticking clock attached to the pile of dynamite in every 'Roadrunner' cartoon. The folks at Timex must WANT this timer to make noise to let you know it's working. Or perhaps it's a marketing gimmick - when guests ask ""What's that ticking behind the sofa?"", you can answer ""Why, that's my TIMEX timer, of course."" I have 3 of these and they're all loud, so it must be on-purpose."
1,Piece of garbage...don't waste your money...,"very poorly designed, stopped working within the first month. cheap plastic internal pieces that broke easily. Upon opening the device it was apparent why it broke, the pieces used to make it are fragilely thin."
3,Very easy,"If you're a fan of Thomas Middleton's challenging Acrostics, you'll find this batch very easy. The Random House ""Puzzle Meter"" on the cover rates it on the Hard side: I shudder to think of what their ""Easy"" puzzles are like! And Mr. Hook's doggerel definitions end up being more annoying than fun after a while. But this would be a good starter book for someone just beginning Acrostics."
2,Timex outdoor timer,"Timex L12/887/3999P04 Outdoor Countdown Timer with Photoeye & LEDPurchased 8 timers for my Xmas displays. Was not able to set timer so that it would go on and off daily. Instructions on back of unit small enough to require a magnifying glass to easily read. Called the 800 number and they could not help, but said they would ask someone else and call back. No call back. Called and spoke to another representative who knew even less than myself. Returned all units and bought WalMart outdoor timers for $10.23 each and they are functioning properly. Plus I didn't need a magnifying glass to read the instructions."
1,hotel style towel rack,This rack was not worth the money. That's what I don't like about ordering on line. I like to see what I'm buying.
5,beautiful,"beautiful album. The music is so soothing, from the first song . He has a beautiful soft voice that is very pleasant to listen to.this is a must buy album, I wish he would do more vocals.The album is very powerful in the way that it reaches down deep into one's soul-incredible. i love the entire album."
1,Don't Buy This Item,"I should have known better, I have never purchased a Hello Kitty electronic item that has worked correctly! I bought this camera for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas. It says that it takes regular AA batteries, but the image was very poor and the sound was inaudible. I replaced the batteries with brand new rechargeable Energizers and the video was better but the sound was still garbled. I took this back to Toys R Us and was told that they do not take returns on electronic items that have been opened, even with a receipt and even if it's defected, you can only get an exchange (not even a store credit). They didn't have any more in stock, so I was stuck with it, or so I thought. Then I took it to another Toys R Us, the Customer Service person at that store said that it seemed that everyone they sold was being returned because it didn't work. That store refunded my money with no problem."
5,Cathartic,"I read this book in 1994. It was an epiphany! I discovered I was a winter and purged my closet of all non-winter colors. I can always find something to wear and something to match. I save time and money when I shop for new items. If it's not in my pallette, I don't buy it. I would highly recommend it for someone who has lost weight and needs a new wardrobe, or just for a reference to keep with your bible and your dictionary."
3,Useful but Outdated,"Color Me Beautiful was written in the 80's, bearing that in mind, the book is decent. It offers the basic color pallettes for the Winter, Spring, Summer, and Autumn seasons and helps you determine with season is yours. It offers basic wardrobe information and ways to help you organize your closet and shop for clothes that fit your body type. However, while reading this book, one must keep in mind that the tips are from the 80's. If you want a more modern book, this isn't for you. If you know how to take this information and turn it into more modern advice, then this is a great deal. If you are going to purchase this book new, rather than used, I would say you can find better more up-to-date books for the prices. However, if you purchase it used, it is a very nifty books that you can get some basic color analysis information from and save you a bit of money."
4,"A good standard reference, helpful and meaningful advice","As a middle-aged transgendered woman, I know I do not fit the standard reader. But I found this book immensely helpful in discerning subtle color issues I had been guessing at. Ms. Jackson speaks to the reader in a quiet yet directive way, guiding the decisions to find colors best suited in clothing, hair and make-up. This book exceeded my expectations in providing nonjudgmental guidance toward understanding my own coloration and to developing a ""feel"" for my true color nature. I recommend this book to anyone who feels challenged by all the palettes and textures and cuts available in today's world. Though written years ago, her sensibility toward style seems timeless. I got lost a couple of times in her wording, but realized I was just needing to reread to get her meaning. I felt very empowered by this book and believe other inexperienced girls like myself will be as well.Best wishes,paige"
3,Need updating,"Although this book contains so many helpful informations, its illustrations seemed somewhat outdated.I find that it is very hard for me to make this book as my style guide since there have been so many changes in fashion world lately.So, although those looks could be considered to be really gorgeous at that time [80's] it would seemed weird if we practice it nowadays."
4,Timeless,"Great, timeless book with easy-to-use principles, questions, and diagrams to help you find your most flattering colors and styles for your clothing and makeup. Besides color analyzing, it also has sections on skin care, makeup application, choosing essential pieces of clothing for a basic wardrobe, and more. It's definitely a classic book that will get you off to a good start on the journey to looking your best!"
4,Pretty good,"The book talks about 4 different color types: Summer, Spring, Winter and Fall and which shades and colors should be worn by women, depending on which color type they belong to. This book can be used to help you determine which shades and colors make you look better, teach you wearing ""your"" colors. As a friend of mine once said that even if you are depressed, single, lonely and sick, if you are wearing a sweater of ""your"" color you will look decent. Perhaps not excellent but not bad either. ""Your"" colors will bring out the best in you.I found this book to be very helpful in determining the colors that are right for me, but one thing in the book I didn't like - there are a number of clothing personalities listed but it's not really easy to determine which one you belong to. I mean, there is no way to double check if you have selected your clothing personality correctly."
2,Sonoma Lavender Lilac Plush Heat Wrap,"The scent of this product is lovely and relaxing. However, the flaxseed insert is so heavy, I had a hard time lifting the wrap, much less placing it on my shoulders. This product is way too heavy and bulky for those who plan to use it for arthritis, fibromyalgia or similar pain relief. If you need a firm, heavy, bulky, weighted wrap to place on your shoulders for pain relief, this wrap is for you. If you need something light and soothing for pain, this product will disappoint. If this line offered a lightweight version, I would definitely order it."
5,Great straight ahead jazz,Barney Kessel was doing great things on this record and Monty Alexander was awesome on piano. Well worth the price of admission.
1,Look to Storyline,"I think this (the latest Culture novel) is the worst of Banks' novels. It appeared to me as if a good down payment from his publisher was his key motivation rather than literature (I saw Asimov do the same think with his later Foundation novels). The storyline was incredibly weak and finally fizzled into about 3 weaker non-endings. Characters were invisible to my mind's eye; twists generally turned into Moebius vortexes and the SF concepts were generally self-indulgent and verging on lifeless. Sorry, I was a huge fan until yesterday - hey Ian M. Banks, where's your Culture gone?"
4,"Slightly darker, not so vast","I'd really give it 3.5 stars if I could... The start is indeed slow, but what struck me more than anything about this book is how dark and almost hopeless the tone is. The narrative gets very deeply mired at points in destruction and undoing; of course, we knew that Banks could do this, but in a Culture story? It's as though the tone from _Song of Stone_ bleeds into this book. There is something deeply hopeless here, very different from the near jubilance in _Excessions_. The novel also suffers -- where its predecessors shine -- as we ""zoom out"" to the scattered locations and environments the characters inhabit. Things get a little loose, diffuse.Still, it's a Culture novel, and it's a Iain [M or no] Banks novel. Of course I read it. I'm glad I read it. I find myself wondering, though, between _Look to Windward_ and the aforementioned _Stone_; what is so bad that has recently happened to our author?"
4,Good Culture Book,"Less mind boggling than ""Use of Weapons"" and much less derivative than ""Inversions"" this Banks Culture novel is accessible. Advise starting Culture reading with ""Consider Phlebas"". Banks writing, scene and story are challenging and rewarding. Some of his books would get 3 stars for being multifarious but most are 4-5s, as is ""Look to Windward"""
5,A Library of Flash MX Information,"I cannot give less than 5 stars, Mohler did a phenom-job of writing this book. Every question that I asked myself while I was reading eventually was answered, usually within the next few pages. Also he provides information on bitmaps and audio in a detailed fashion (a chapter for each), which might[tick] you off, but there is a connection between those items and Flash, it's just harder to see when your inexperienced.Other than that it includes a CD-ROM with tutorials, which are helpful. And there is quite a bit of information on Actionscript, to get you familiar with it.It's a library of information on Flash MX, in which you can keep going back to for more books or videos, if you'd like to try your hand at some of the advanced tutorials for practice."
1,Just Awful,"If you are hoping to hear the incredible guitar playing you expect from Tommy Emmanual, this is NOT the CD to buy. There are a few good tracks like Blue Moon but most of the three discs are a waste of plastic. This is Emmanual playing with other musicians and it sounds like elevator music. This is what Emmanual must have been refering to on a PBS special when he complained about how record companies expected him to play instead of how he wanted to play."
5,Great inexpensive cable,"I bought this cable to use for connecting my Presonus Firebox recording interface to my 15"" Macbook Pro for music / home studio recording. After several months of relatively infrequent use (2-3 times per month for a few hours each), I'm very satisfied. This definitely meets my needs for a much lower cost than many other ""name"" brand cables."
5,Works Great!,Received this item quickly. It does what it's supposed to to. Was able to transfer my date from my MacBook Pro to my new iMac with no problems. I highly recommend this cable!
3,Ok if your not 90 y.o,I'm convinced there is no perfect pill box for the elderly. They all are difficult to open- this one is no different. If you find one that is easy to open they arent' large enough to handle the multitude of meds. I choose the snack baggies option
4,Excellent,definitely one of the best products I've purchased and I've spent less money. fast and on time. thanks for everythnig
1,Not sure what these headphones would be good for,"I bought 2 of these headphones for my 20 and 23 year-old sons (both musicians). They had been highly recommended by a salesman at Guitar Center, who said they were widely used in recording studios. The sound quality was ok and they fit the head very comfortably, but the game-breaker was the volume. Neither set played loud enough...we tried plugging into iPads, iPods, computer, and direct from a keyboard. With everything turned up ""to 11"", they weren't loud enough. We had thought the first set we tried was faulty, but then the second set was exactly the same. Amazon was great about the return, even though both sets had been opened."
1,not like they used to be,"the photo I saw was a item Made in Austria, the one I got was made in china and the quality is not the same.the seller said he would refund a return and that this model is not made in Austria anymore.Seller Good , product BAD."
4,Nice - I like it,"These are good, i have k271mkII and k-240 and Sennheiser 518 and many small ones, the K 240 has better bass and and 518 is much better, but little compromising on the rest. The 271 is awesome on everything except the lows, i mean if you are a rock and roll and classic guy these will be good, but if you are a sort of a person who wants a little more bass bang the 240 are good, and the Sennheiser 518 sound completely different they are good too, but i find the 271 more crisp and clear. And ya they are made in China which kind of ruins the whole wow part, they are comfortable, i like the detachable cable part."
3,A Bit Closer to 4,"The product is not bad. I got it as a gift and she loves it. It really deserve more like a 3.75, closer to 4 but not quite. I would recommend buying it. Bass is a little weak, its really a ""clear"" headphone. Really closer for what DJs want than for audiophiles. The acoustics and resonance is weak and it absolutely does not filter out any sound. I have a pair of Audio Technica A700s and I like those way more and would totally recommend them more.Audio Technica ATH-A700 Headphones"
2,Disappointed,"As a transcriber, these were recommended to me to get crisp, clear sound quality. I am disappointed that the quality is no better than the earphones I currently use for transcription."
3,Airhead Bride,"Eighty percent of this book is fabulous and romantic. Where it becomes a bore is when Claire finds out her husband is the man that killed her father. Once she finds out he's the man that killed her father, it just gets dragged out and out and out. I agree with the other reviewers that said she loves him, hates him, loves him, hates him. The heroine is an airhead that can't seem to make up her own mind. Then when the auther tries to create a way that makes it all ok in the end, the logic is just too intricate and twisted and unbelievable and I was tired of reading about it by then. She should have kept that part much simpler and not taken the last 1/3 of the book for the bride to make up her mind if she was going to stay married to him or not."
3,"Enjoyable, but not one of Jo Beverly's best.","Lord of Midnight was not the usual Jo Beverly style. Most of her books are fun and make you laugh out loud at the antics of her hero and heroine. I continued reading hoping that some of the delightful characters she had created would do something madcap. But they didn't. If you haven't read ""Something Wicked"" by Ms. Beverly, please do so. Caution-- you will laugh alot."
4,"An ""interesting"" film.","I saw this film years ago in a theater. Since then I purchased an earlier DVD version and gave it to my son. Watched it at his home last summer and decided I wanted my own copy so purchased this Hyper-Drive Edition. Haven't watched all the selections yet but did enjoy the film again. It's slow in places but I always enjoy the ""bomb"", a very dry and logical character. The alien gets the best of the crew, too. The ending, from the final conversation with the ""bomb"" to the song with the surfer heading into the planet are worth the price of the DVD. It's also fun to look at the props and set dressing. They were very creative with a limited budget!"
4,smells gooood,"now my baby smells too good. Got it in deal thought to give it a try , but it has goood smell and doesnot contain alcohol in it."
4,"Great episodes, but the edits are very disappointing",My favorite of the three SatAM VHS releases. Hooked on Sonics and especially Warped Sonic are two great episodes from the series. But the downside is that the episodes are edited from their original ABC airings. I was disappointed the Super Sonic DVD compilation doesn't include these.
4,Ebony Marshal,"A western offering something different. Tyler Musler is trying to make a place for himself and his family when an old enemy turns up. Hunted, Musler goes on the run. Lots of action and more than just another western. Recommended."
3,The Camping Cot....,"This is a well made, sturdy cot.....although it is stated for 'camping'...it is very large, and only folds in half.It would take up much room as well as weight in the vehicle forgoing camping.Actually....when I ordered this cot...I thought that I had ordered one that breaks down and folds up into a neat little bag....to gocamping in the mountains. I was very suprised when it arrived in a very large box...and soon realized that this will have to stay in the house...to use as an extra bed for company....and that I will have to order another one that folds up small for camping.It is a very well made cot....but I accidentally ordered the wrong thing.Such is life...these things happen..........Sincerely,Cindy Ferguson"
1,Anycom does NOT work.,Followed instructions and download any new software from anycom. Still does not work as a headset. Sent anycom an email and reviewed their online FAQ. They never responded. Their online system of Q & A suggest many other people have the same problems. Zero Star Rating
1,Even Would Be a Bad Short Story,"I have nothing against LDP and enjoyed many of his movies in the past, including the book series movie he starred in about a Navajo deputy, the great Adam Beach did the rest. However, this movie just drug on and on seemingly like a cartoon is made with the same scenes just altered a little bit. The dialog was like Ground Hog Day. Over and over, the same words, If it was a 1/2 hour short it might have worked but it was way too long, like this review was."
1,A poorly chosen set of words for a small dictionary,"I'm reviewing this as an English Speaker learning Icelandic, so I spend most of my lookup time looking up words in the Icelandic-English section. That section is smaller than the English-Icelandic section, so right of the bat, most of the dictionary goes unused.The spellings are archaic, with verzlun instead of verslun.The word choice is peculiar with lots of rare and uncommon words.The definitions are often too short. Icelandic abounds with words with multiple definitions that can't be guessed from the other definitions.The main advantage of this book is that it is cheap as compared to the often breathtakingly expensive dictionaries one finds when in Iceland."
2,"Handy, yet hardly","As a lover of the Icelandic Language myself, I decided to buy this book to help me understand this ancient viking language, but the truth is it doesn't. When writing text in Icelandic, as I must do for my Icelandic class it is helpful with some words. However, this book produces extremely little help with pronunciation, and no help in the grammatical aspects, it provides a jole of words, yet not enough. It's a good reference to have and exciting to skim, but when using the spoken word of this language the book produces little or no help at all. In conclusion, it is nice small book that's quite handy...yet hardly. :o|"
3,description about movie,"A group of citified farm animals used to a star existence at a petting zoo try to adjust to their new environment when they\'re relocated to a dude ranch in these episodes of the offbeat animated series from Australia. The delightfully quirky characters include a business-savvy cow, a hip-hop-loving sheep, a gourmet-snob goat, a hip techno horse, an extreme-sports fan bull, a neurotic rat and an obsessive-compulsive crow."
2,Quality of the book,"This is not a review of the HG Wells stories which are obviously 2 of the finest works of Science Fiction ever. This is a review regarding the quality of the book itself. I bought this combo-book for my son to introduce him to the works of HG Wells, however he could barely get past the first few pages because the print is so small it is impossible to read. The clarity of the printing and the sharpness of each letter of each word is horrible. The words are blurry, the letters are at times indistinguishable from each other. By all means read the Wells books, but I suggest not trying to save a couple of dollars by buying this version. Search for a better quality book."
5,They're COOL!,"They sounds Like McBride & the Ride and Deanna Jarrett. The Everly Brothers was Disgust their Song ""Bye Bye Love"" or ""(Til)i kissed You. Don's two Daughters, Dana And Mercedes smile at uncle Phil, He said ""you Like It?"""
4,Good,"The item was how it was described, and shipping was speedy. It came in way before my classes even started. Awesome"
2,An answer to the author's curiosity,"Larry Diamond wonders in one section of the book why the USA didn't stop Iraqi massacres of some of it's own population in 1991. I give him the answer. The USA was still a little paralyzed from the militarily-crippling antiwar demonstrations of the late 1960's early 70's. Those demonstrators made it hard for the USA to use the american army, navy, air force and marine corps in any kind of fight. True we used the military in Desert Storm but only till the Iraqis were out of Kuwait. Taking over Iraq in 1991 was too sure to bring heavy US civilian protesting movements. By 2003 the former 60's protester were too old or had passed away or were now too involved in their own lives to take such an active part in organizing effective demonstration movements."
1,Judge not lest ye be judged...,"I do not understand why anyone would think their faith is better than someone else's. I cannot imagine equating tolerance of evil with tolerance of a buddhist friend, or a non-christian friend, or a muslim friend etc. This book was ridiculous, but it was also scary.What would Jesus do? I try to think of that. He would invite everyone in to dine with him and love us all. After all God made all of us in his image, we are all here for a reason. Maybe that reason is to love one another and accept goodness and acts of kindness from even those who do not share our own faiths."
1,Doesn't deserve one star,"Just plain doesn't work at all. First, it seems the directions for changing the combo are wrong. The screw won't turn as indicated, so the combo can't be changed from 00000 (unless there is a hidden secret). Second, once you plug the connector into the lock (it goes together very easily), it will never unlock. Period. Now, they've had plenty of time to amend the instructions. I suspect the entire production is defective in design.Let's see. What's wrong with this picture. 1. The combo will always be 00000. (That'll stop a thief). 2. You'll never be able to unlock the lock. Talk about secure!At least I tried it before attaching it to the PC! And Amazon is good about supplying a return postage label. Why are they trying to sell this junk? I got two different no-brands that are fine, and the name brand is the bad one!"
1,can't get a prime,The directions seemed simple enough. Everything went smoothly until it was time to plug the unit in. That's when the trouble started. I've been trying to get a prime for 3 hours now. I've tried everything and nothing is working. I'm extremely frustrated and definitely regret buying this filter.
4,7th grade book review,"I thought it was a good book. It was down to earth. The book highlighted the problems of Apartheid. It wasn't the best book I've read, but it was interesting and kept me guessing the whole time. I enjoyed this book and if you're anything like me you will too."
