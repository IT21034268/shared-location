4,An excellent guide to CDs,"While I prefer the Penguin Guide if you only want one, because it is more comprehensive and has what I find to be a better rating system, the Gramophone Good CD guide is very valuable in its own right, with recommendations certainly on all major pieces of classical music and opera and on many lesser known ones as well. The reviews are very well and concisely written, indeed one can get a valuable education just reading the guide, and I have yet to go wrong with a recommendation. The best of all worlds is to have both this guide and the Penguin and to use both before selecting a CD to buy; I personally use Penguin as my main guide and then use Gramophone to see if they recommend the same recording (quite often they do) or if they have alternative recommendations."

4,VERY ENJOYABLE SNACK,"GREAT FOR A NIBBLE, NICE FLAVOR AND THEY CAME FRESH. THIS IS THE 5TH OR 6TH TIME I BOUGHT THEM"
1,Tough Little Frogs,"I have bought several haribo gummy treats thru Amazon to feed the masses at work, but unfortunately this one was not worth the $.The downfall of this candy based on feedback is that the tough and tasteless white base ruins the potentially tasty frogs. Skip tis for other better haribo gummys."
2,If you just need a little light....,"This unit is not very bright. Would not buy again. It would be ok if you just wanted to illuminate your keyboard, but not for reading (get an illuminated keyboard instead if this is what you're after)."
2,Not exactly what I was hoping for,"Just purchased a new laptop and cannot see the keys in the dark. Purchased the Kensington Notebook Light based on other reviews. However, the light is too direct. Needs to be more of a flood light to cover the key board. I don't like the fact that all the stress is on the port."
4,Extremely Durable,"I have beat the crap out of this thing for 3 years now. Almost every night I DJ with it.It's illumination range IS a bit compromised as other reviews point out, but with full intensity enabled I can still see the whole keyboard.If your vision is lacking, you may have more trouble maybe.Bottom line: if you are looking for a durable light, look no further."
1,flicka,"The light was fine for the first couple months but now it flickers annoyingly and that is why I am buying another, this one came up again and i just had to put in my review! I do like the length and flexibility, two settings are nice too, it does more of a spot light than an area light."
1,Minimum wear and tear and it was done,"Carried this in my laptop bag. I guess travel must have been too much for it, because after 2 trips the tension in the neck was gone and the lamp would no longer stand up. That's too bad, considering it was supposedly designed for travel. Piece of junk - will not buy Kensington again."
2,4 years expected life,"This will last about 4 years if you use it about every other day for smoothies. It has a 5 year warranty, so seems like the manufacturer agrees with the life that actaully seems to be. I sent the old one back (cost $20 to send the heavy base via UPS) and I'll see if they actually honor the warranty. I can't find anything better yet, so I replaced it with a new one this year (2013)."
3,Burned Out,"I bought this blender mostly for smoothies and margaritas. I thought $100 would get a good enough blender for these pretty typical uses. Well it burned out on about the 10th use and went in the trash. It was pretty good while it lasted, but I think I need to step it up to a higher quality blender that I wont have to worry about."
3,Melville's final film,"This film was the last made by John-Pierre Melville. As is typical for Melville, the most American of the French directors, it's a caper flick. Oddly, while it has one of his favorite French actors (Alain Delon) in it, he also has American actor Richard Crenna in one of the dual lead roles. Full of the usual Melville touches, particularly the long static shots and long silences, it fails to reach the heights of his finest movies. Though not a bad film, it's not a great film. If you've never seen a Melville film before, start with either Bob Le Flambeur(1955) or Le Deuxieme Souffle (Second Wind)(1966), then once you're hooked, come back to this one."
5,"A night of enchantment,","The New Year's Eve concert 2010 at the Semperoper, Dresden, was beyond my expectation. Leh√°r's ""Die lustige Witwe"" itself is a sequence of unforgetable melodies, with only the highlights of the opereta, without dialogues. The DVD was very well recorded, in both image and sound, which allowed me to see the great performances of the orchestra, the singers and the magnificent choir. As an opereta lover, I give it a maximum rate."
5,Great music from a Christian heart full of LOVE for the LORD,Love Letter is full of songs that are just that. Brian shares his heart with his listeners while singing of his LOVE for the LORD. This CD has tracks that are a little slower than some of Brian's earlier work before winning on Gospel Star. Plenty of these songs are upbeat too so there's something for everybody no matter what you're in the mood to listen to. If you like Casting Crowns and others of that style I think you'll like Brian Smith.
3,"Bad Acting, but still a good story","This is painful to watch. The acting is awful. However, it still was something that was educational. Just get past the bd acting. We really enjoy topics on the American Revolution."
5,Great Brain Exercises for kids.,These problem solving activities are a great way for your kids to exercise their brains. My 2nd grader loves them! But even my kindergartener can do them with a little help. We always make a copy of the answer chart so that we can use them again and again. I remember doing these puzzles when I was in school. A great way to spend some time without having to plug-in!
5,Exceptionally well-written and informative,"""Out of the Black Hole"" details a personal battle and success against depression. If you or someone you care about is in the grips of depression, I highly recommend this book. Prescription drugs and talk therapy alone are often inadequate for many suffering from depression. The latest treatment, Vagus Nerve Stimulation, the authors personal experience and the resulting effects are laid out in an insightful and practical manner for everything from dealing with family to insurance issues."
5,"Magnificent writing, powerful story","I don't know how many of you saw the incredible review of this novel in the NY Times last Friday, but it made me go out and buy it and read it this past weekend. It's everything the reviewer (Richard Bernstein) promised, and more. It's the sort of book best read in one or two sittings--you completely get into this world, and the writing just takes you over. Yes some of it's brutal and sad, but I sensed some light, a strong ray of hope, from the very beginning that is born out as the book proceeds. The author always manages to keep it there, and it makes you care, makes you care passionately what happens to the narrator and his sister's baby in the next room. It's a universal story, it's Calcutta but it's anywhere. I could go on and on--I can't tell you what a classy, important writer this guy is. This book is major!"
2,The stars say it all...,"After reading the book, I ended up with more questions than answers. There are so many unanswered questions that I couldn't stop thinking about the book. I wonder if this was the author's intention. At first I thought that I am too young to understand this book as I am just a teenager, but after reading the other reviews on this site, I realise that is not the case. Kamal Raj Jha kept opening new stories of the past and didn't really end it, leaving us with a blurry picture. I understand this is his debut, and wish him better luck next time."
1,Pretentious,"I found the story very pretentious and at times there seemed to be an attempt to make things seem bigger than they are. It's a pretty boring story which seems to aspire to take on epic proportions which it does not deserve. If this book was published after 'The God of Small Things' , i really can't help but think of it as a blatant imitation of sorts which lacks momentum and literary beauty of the former."
2,I have certainly read better!,"Raj Kamal Jha's debut novel has been compared to Raymond Carver's work. First of all, I happen to think that The Blue Bedspread isn't worthy of such comparison. The writing is bland, the characters are boring, the story isn't particularly shocking -- which surprises me, for the serious issues in this novel, such as abuse, betrayal and incest, could make even the most experienced reader cringe -- and the surprise ending isn't so, well, surprising. In the end, I feel as though I have wasted hours on a book that should have been kept on the store's shelf. ... Whatever you do, skip this one!"
5,An important book....and timely.,"This is one of the most engaging works of fiction I've read, quite possibly in years. It's a slight book, but slight in the way Camus' The Stranger is slight. This is very much a meditation....the narrator, though ostensibly addressing this newborn orphan, he is just as much (if not more) addressing himself...talking to himself....and remembering.....and doing this slowly, as that as how we remember such painful memories. In many ways, this reminds me of some of Paul Auster's non-fiction. Very moving, thought-provoking, at times a bit too purple, but, overall, stunning, and a much needed breath of fresh air. Loved it."
2,overrated...better ones out there,"This is not a very good recording, from a conductor who is really overrated. Bland, bland, bland. For some great recordings of these monumental pieces, go with Solti's more esteemed contemporaties - Szell and Karajan."
2,Are not as great as other Haribo products,Maybe it is because I do not particularly like marshmallows but these were a disappointment.The outside tasted a bit like fruit roll-ups but the inside was not a good kind of sweet. The two put together it is tolerable but not very tasty. Will not buy again.
3,Needs better leg holders.,I purchased this item with all expectations of helping with my recovery but I relized that if you have larger legs(below the knee)that the ratchet system doesn't work very well. I could either clamp it down so tight that I wouldn't slide out or leave it loose so that it didn't hurt both ways made it very uncomfortable. I do have to say the unit is built very well. It was very easy to put together. This was the only problem I had with the machine and I did have to return it.
5,Love it!,"This is a great Inversion Table! It is easy to use, no worry about getting stuck upside down. (Important to read the directions!) Just need to make sure you have room enough to put it. It does take up space, but is worth every penny."
5,Inversion table is great,"I couldn't ask for a better inversion table. This model suited all my needs just fine. Been using it for a few weeks now. I'm not rendering a medical opinion but this table is working good for me, not a cure but a good treatment.I payed for shipping to get here in 2 business days - it came in one day! Not hard to set up but get help cause the box is heavy."
4,Good table,"I was nervous about purchasing the table due to others saying it was so hard to assemble and or that they had problems using it. I ordered it because my pain management doctor requested me too. It was heavy, like 78 pounds I think BUT UPS brought it into my garage and 2 of us (ladies) had it assembled and were on it in under 40 minutes. We are starting out with out full inversion but it really did take the pressure and pain off my spine where my disc is bulging. Also felt it pop my back almost immediatly. Back hasn't been able to pop in over 2 yrs, that actually felt good as well. The ankle holders feel nice and stable. I like this table and hope it continues helping my pain. So far it looks to have been a wise purchase. I did not give it 5 stars because it just came today and I wanted to leave room for error since nothing is perfect :)"
4,Good tv,I have only been using the tv for about a week now and it seems great. I haven't had any problems with it. The menu is very easy to navigate but the remote is a bit harder to get used to.
5,Wonderful,I was so frustrated at the old wheelbarrow tires that I could have screamed. I was almost cheaper to buy another wheelbarrow than to try to replace the tire. These work great.
3,Worth Having,"Good book. Goes into heavy detail on how to shorten the pan. But doesnt cover every area as well. Chapter on tools could have been left out, chances are if your going to build a buggy you already have the basic tools. I already built a buggy (prior to purchasing this book) so most of the information I already knew. Good book to have just for the pan shortening info. I welcome any new books written on the dunebuggy subject. Written in UK english."
3,Cheap price - cheap sound,"Based on the reviews of these speakers on other sites (e.g., Circuitcity), they sounded promising. Unfortunately, when I hooked them up, they sounded hollow and tinny, like cheap boombox speakers. I may end up keeping them anyway because there's such a huge price jump to higher quality outdoor speakers. Sound aside, the mounting brackets are solid and the 5-way binding posts are decent as well. However, I bought them for sound, and have been disappointed."
4,LUCAS DAVENPORT # EIGHT,"This is the eighth book in the Lucas Davenport series, SUDDEN PREY. In cold Minnesota, Davenports teams stops a bank robbery that results in the death of a female robber. The family comes to town for revenge. This might be the deadliest of the series. More shoot 'em ups than I remember in the other books. Lucas Davenport is one of the best detectives in the genre. Very fast paced and violent this is s fun, quick read; the action never stops. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. On to SECRET PREY."
5,8th in the Prey Series,"'Sudden Prey' starts with a botched bank robbery, and ends with a plot for revenge.Because of the death of his family in a shoot-put with Lucas Davenport and his team of detectives, Dick LeChaise vows revenge on the cops involved, as well as their families. He even breaks out of prison to do it.As a stand-alone book, this might not be 5 stars, however, in the context of this series it is definitely deserves those 5 stars. If you would like to start reading the 'Prey' series, start with 'Rules of Prey.' Otherwise, this is just more of the same great Lucas Davenport and friends."
4,Don't blink or you will miss it,"This was a very fast paced novel. It was hard to put down after I started to read it. I explained to my wife that it wasn't exactly intellectually stimulating, but was an enjoyable read. I think the phrase my wife used was ""Bubblegum for the mind."""
5,Revenge is a B- - - - h,"In this ""Prey"" installment by Sandford, Davenport and his team are faced with a cold-blooded killer who has one thing on his mind. Revenge. After his sister and wife are killed in a foiled bank robbery attempt, an extreme right-winged government hating milita member seeks revenge on the policemen who are responsible. After he escapes from prison, he enlists a few members, including a dirty cop, seeking vengeance against those responsible for his sister and wife's deaths.A very tense thriller with non-stop action and excitement. I had a hard time putting this one down. Sudden Prey could rank as one of Sandford's best novels."
2,Too many implausible situations,I like action books that contain at least plausible scenarios. This book doesn't. You would have to believe in a whole series of highly unlikely events to enjoy this book. From incompetent cops to the luckiest criminals of all time. The story line just didn't work.
2,Brain Wilson at his strasngest!,"This album is a far cry from any of their previous work, but a definate must to own if you love the Beach Boys. Although sometimes poorly produced, this album does contain those all too firmiliar 'Can't get that tune out of my head' gems. If you are into the stranger side of 'surf' music I recommend this album and thier strangely similar album 'Smiley Smile'"
2,try something else,I have found less expensive and higher quality products at stores nearby. The birds don't seem to like it and I will be looking elsewhere for my next carton of suet.
2,Not Durable,"My spoon also developed a cracked after only having it a week and handwashing it. This crack was in the tip of the bowl of the spoon. Needless to say I was disappointed and will give the replacement another chance before giving up on the Batali line of wooden spoons. I also purchased the flat end spoon and just recently noticed a similar crack. I ,may return this one as well. I am now considering a solid maple wood spoon from CIA which costs more than twice as this one. It does come with a lifetime warranty though."
1,cracked almost immediately,"Got this here because I wanted a quality wooden spoon. I bought some super cheap ones at a local store that all splintered almost immediately.Figured this one would hold up, unfortunately it did not. After using it maybe 3 times it developed a crack in the spoon. I did not leave it soaking in anything or wash it in a dishwasher (I don't own one!) The wood is really thin right at the center of the spoon which is why I'm guessing it cracked? Anyhow obviously the name ""Mario Batali"" doesn't mean anything in regards to quality, just that he gets a few cents every time you waste your money on it. Stay away."
5,What a FIND!,"Our dog is 15 years old and the cold really affects him. We were giving him small bones like these and they seemed to help. But at $10-$12 for 8 oz. he didn't get many. With these bones they are larger and the cost is minimal, he now gets them as treats and it has helped him a lot. We all WIN."
3,Review of HIC Porcelain 10 - 1/2-inch Pie Plate,"I just received the HIC 10 1/2"" Porcelain Pie Plate. It is very pretty, but I was disappointed to see that when filled to the brim with water, its capacity is about equal to my glass Pyrex 9"" deep pie plate (about one quart plus a scant 1/2 cup). The porcelain plate is constructed so that there is a pronounced slope at the top of the plate. The diameter of the bottom of the HIC porcelain plate is roughly 7 1/16"", whereas the diameter of the bottom of the Pyrex plate is roughly 7 1/2"". I'll keep the HIC plate, but I don't expect that it will make a more capacious pie than the Pyrex."
1,Impeller on B&D cordless CS100 disintegrated,"My Blacker and Decker CS100 broom was light and easy to use. I got it because my husband has a pacemaker and so we had to stop using our gas powered blower. The battery charge lasted up to about 20 minutes. But the impeller disintegrated after about 20 months use. Can't find my receipt so can't get warrantee repair. The impeller, which is made of very flimsy plastic, isn't available. One must replace entire power unit.I definitely will not buy another one."
2,Black and Decker not made to last,"Just a little over two years with sporadic use and the impeller shattered. Scared the daylights out of me because when it shatters, it blows up into pieces and is a quite loud little explosion. It is useful for quick cleanups but you must rememember; this is Black & Decker. Use it for a while until its time to throw it away. For the most part, B &D only makes throw away tools. Battery life is about 15 minutes when new and about ten minutes after a year or so. A little after 2 years, battery does not hold full charge and lasts for about 5 minutes. B & D should have used lithium-ion batteries. I would have paid more for this feature but they dont offer it. For the impeller to shatter after two years is unacceptable. A metal impeller would have prevented this. But again, it's B & D. Fancy tools with nice colors. Poor tool function and even worse quality."
1,Impeller part is not available unless...,"You have to purchase the entire blower assembly in order to replace the impeller. It is not a question of IF the impeller will fail but WHEN it will fail. There are a large number of unhappy people, including me, that have discovered that the impller can not be purchased alone, you have to, in effect, buy another blower. The price is about $50. You can replace the entire unit for that price. I will not be purchasing B&D; products in the future.Just sign me a former B&D; customer."
4,Life stories recorded,"Mya Than Tint, a Burmese writer, traveled around Myanmar (Burma) interviewing common people about their lives. Their stories are incredible, even though they seem to represent average Burmese people. He interviews a fortune-teller, a pick-pocket, a photographer, a laundry man, an elephant trainer, a flower seller, several actors, a waitress, and many others (35 altogether). They tell about their parents, childhoods, jobs, hopes for the future, loves lost, struggles to survive. People interested in modern Myanmar can't do better than reading this book. Sometimes it can be exhausting, because the stories are so moving and thought-provoking. If it were more well-written, it would truly be great literature. As it is, it's pretty darn good. Read it, learn, laugh and nearly weep."
5,"Really cool ""How to draw book""","Wow, this was exactly what it said it was. Great Book actually 6 books in 1 and my boys love it!Couldn't be happier with this purchase. The book arrived very fast. I'd buy from this seller again."
4,Best on the market (shume mire!),"Colloquial Albanian is an easy to follow, concise introduction to shqip (Albanian). Isa Zymberi gives clear instruction on the many verb stems and tenses/moods. A fairly broad vocab is covered, although I recommend anyone learning shqip by themselves should also buy an english-albanian dictionary. The accompyaning cassette is essential to develop pronuciation and listening skills. As said by other readers, the book is poorly bound and leafs will start to fall out withing the first few weeks of use. I suggest taking the book to a book-binder who will re-enforce it with string or glue. Overall, a very good book, one of the the best on the market.(There aren't to many on the market, though). I have some Albanian friends from Pristina and they also gave praise to the book, although some phrases brought a smirk to their faces. Would I buy It? -Sigurisht!"
1,A mess of a novel,"Pest Control was a thoroughly enjoyable book. This was not.There was a fundamental problem with this book. I found it hard to care about any of the characters. I thought the evil businessman was too over the top, and the environmental activist to be a whiny and self-loathing wimp. For everyone's info, I could not finish the book.The story itself was also pretty bad. There was no sense of pacing. There would be pages upon pages in which the main character is describing the woes of his childhood, and then suddenly he goes to collect signatures for a petition. It really hurt the continuity, and as a result, the readability of this book.I cannot recommend this book. If you want to read something by Fitzhugh, go read Pest Control."
1,"Beware -- ""too good to be true"" generally isn't","Ah! Tricky!I order the battery. Time passes with no shipping notification from the vendor (BargainCell). I call Amazon helpdesk. I'm assured it's all good.Today I get the order-cancellation email, 3 days *after* the battery is supposed to arrive. Reason? ""Out of stock""Stay away from these jokers."
2,Missed Opportunity!,"Great concept for a story, however, the writers missed this one by many miles! Uma Thurmans character was a little over the top. The story missed many, many opportunities to explore the content they actually brought up. Some of the things you see in the trailer were not nearly as funny as you thought it would be. There is just so much more they could have done, yet they choose to lean on the obsurd, stupid and idiotic."
3,Not bad...but not great,"This movie is really more something that a teenager would enjoy. As an adult, I found it pretty boring. Uma Thurma really had to dumb herself down for this role, then again doesn't she always play roles like this? Luke Wilson is sooooo boring in this film. He is not an actor, and I do not understand how he even keeps employed. Just a plywood standup that moves around for two hours.Other than that, it is not bad. G-girl as she is called (Thurman) is a woman with super powers not much unlike Superman. G-girl ends up liking Matt (plywood standup) who suddenly kicks her to the curb after initially pursuing her. G-Girl decides she has not been treated right and uses her powers to get back at plywood stand-I mean-Owen Wilson's brother.Great movie for kids as per PG-13 ratings go!"
4,The other side of stalking,"Certainly not the worst Bizarro Superman type story that I've heard of.The problem is that with great powers doesn't always come a great personality. OJ Simpson and Alexander the Great are two good male examples.Peter Milk-toast is in trouble with super-woman, because he finally realizedhe loved his office best friend. ( he's very lucky in that she returns the favor). The ending is altogether strange with animated comedy credits following.It is nice that Uma Thurman doesn't slice and dice anybody in this one!But when somebody made a crack about her big feet, he regretted it!"
2,Did not work for me,"This is a comic and a romantic comedy movie mixed in together.The story is a guy gets a girlfriend who unknown to him is a superhero. Soon he finds out that she is a superhero. Then the romance turns bad and he leaves her. She gets jealous and nasty. Eventually like all romantic comedy, it has a happy ending when boys get girls and it all works out.I don't like Uma Thurman so maybe that was a problem although no one I thought acted well.Also a superhero is suppose to have respect. Uma Thurman's superhero was comical. The special effects were surprisingly quite poor. It just did not work for me."
3,More about people then what to do,"If you are looking for a book that shows that people are into BDSM and that you're not alone, then go ahead and pick up this book. It is laden with interviews but doesn't have much in way of instruction or how to keep things safe. If you looking of a ""How To"" book, I would recommend SM101 by Jay Wiseman. Differnt Loving covers some basic wintout really getting into anything. The interviews are good as they give you some insight to other's mentality. If you totally new to BDSM (which I am) and have read nothing else this might be a good place to start."
4,Excellent Introduction to the Lifestyle,"This book is a wonderful resource for those who are thinking of exploring or have just begun to explore the realm of BDSM. The authors have provided a frank, intelligent overview into a very broad and often difficult subject. I enjoyed the tone of this book...informative, but not condescending. It's an easy read, and each section stands sufficiently on its own, so if you have a specific need for information you can read only what applies at the time.The only reason this is getting 4 stars from me instead of 5 is the brevity with which sadomasochism is covered. In a sense, it is woven through as an undercurrent in many sections. However, as someone starting to explore this particular facet much more deeply, I would have expected this book to cover SM to the same degree as power plays and fetishism.Overall, I highly recommend this."
5,Beautiful music and singing!,"Of their three concerts I think this one is the best, mainly because the Tenors stuck to more opera than American songs and broadway, their English diction is dreadful. This concert showed the purity of beautiful music untarnished by the sentiments of the contemporary world. What can be more magical than having Zubin Mehta on the poteum in the Baths of Caracalla in Rome. Jose Carreras was beautiful throughout with his rendition of La lamento di Frederico, but especially in Core n'grato. Mehta is sensational. He plays with such beauty but with so much command. The strings in the orchestra were breathtaking and the solo flutist in Rondo al nido was amazing. All three of the Tenors concerts were good but their first is simply the best."
2,The Three Tenors in Concert,"I love listening to these singers, but this CD was not enjoyable to me at all. I missedd the power that I expected to hear."
4,Good reference work,"An encyclopedia-style book with brief entries on every British warship since the 15th century. Information includes ship type, tonnage/dimensions, armament, shipyard where built, years of service. It would be great to see short histories of each ship's career, but that would obviously require a much larger book."
4,Fun game for the psp,"Bought for the kiddo. He loves pac-man games. Graphic wise, story line wise and replay value-He likes this version of Pac man game more then the old school versions. Its fun for all ages. graphics are good. And well, its pac man. :) My spouse and I actually prefer the original Pac Man games though. THis one is more like a 3d adventure. You play as pacman in different worlds. you have legs and arms and collect things. THink like a mario game sorta."
4,Useful Information,The essence of this book is to educate the homeowners to thoroughly prepare for their projects BEFORE embark on their projects. The author presented in a logical way how to make the required preparations. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because I wish more resources on technical ascpects of building/renovation are provided.
1,Occidentalism - not worth reading,"The Book is full of double speak and nonsensical text. The author is trying to impress someone with the verbosity of his writing. Best summed up with:""They sat and talked of magnanimous things with the common sense of two kindly but ignorant people"""
4,What a compelling novel!,"I loved this one, and often had trouble putting it down to go to work, for instance. Yes, it's long, yes, it's complex, but what a magnificent puzzle, and what a fabulous use of real people in a fictional world."
2,Much too Long,"This is an exceptionally promising and challenging idea, but the book runs a good 200 pages longer than it needs to. Many of the scenes fail to move the plot forward or develop the characters, which is a real shame -- Powers is a master of atmospheric detail, and he has a talent for making the bizarre seem routine. Powers appears to have done so much research that he felt he had to include every detail he'd unearthed -- I am reluctant to say he's showing off, but there's simply too much here that doesn't advance the story or the ideas."
4,Another fine effort,"Okay lets state up front this book is not as good as the Anubis gates but very little is.That said I found that i enjoyed this book a lot more than some of the authors later works (Expiration Date and Earthquake Weather). I found it to be a return to the earlier style of powers writing, an historical setting, with historical characters, viewed from another worldly perspective. I also feel being a fan of a good spy story helped in my enjoyment of this book.So what is it about? a retired spy is recalled to the service after many years to complete a mission which had ended in failure on the slopes of mount arrarat. What makes this different is that this mission was to prevent a rival russian organisation harnessing the powers of the Djinn's who occupies the heights. And of course the man at the centre of the russian mission; Kim Philby.In the end I came away from the book entertained and with a greater knowledge of the Djinn and Arab mythology. Recommended."
2,"Don't bother buying this CD, despite digital sound.","Even with digital recording and generally great sound quality, Dorati and the DSO produce lifeless performances of Copland's work, especially in the four suites from Rodeo. Dorati chooses a plodding tempo and the Detroit players seem to be just generally going through the motions. One can say the same about the rendition of the Dance Symphony, but better results are acheived in Appalachian Spring and Fanfare for the Common Man, where the digital sound really adds extra sparkle. However, the best version I've ever heard is still Bernstein with the NYPO, where the adrenaline really lends itself to a fantanstic performance of both Appalachian Spring and Rodeo."
5,Great Book!,"Explains everything, from every angle, on every aspect. I bought this book 2 years ago, and I still use it as a reference in TA. Recomend to anyone in Finance, just starting out, or a pro."
4,good monitor --- lousy speakers,"I've had this monitor for almost a year. The picture quality is great. However, the speakers are lousy - there's a tinny sound, with not much volume. I like that there are two cable attachments (Analog 15-pin D-sub, separate sync; digital DVI-D). Two computers can be attached to the same monitor - just switch monitor selector."
5,"A great Guide to Olive Oil: tasting, selecting, and cooking","This is an excellent book. It includes an extremely lucid discussion of what extra virgin olive oil is and how it is produced. The descriptions of almost 150 oils from around the world are extremely useful, especially since it includes oils commonly found in most supermarkets in addition to specialty oils (lots of web addresses are included). The discussion on how to classify and taste olive oil is probably the best I have ever read. Almost 2/3 of the book is devoted to wonderful recipes based on olive oil. I have not even finished reading it yet and I have already marked favorites and just took the first batch of olive and pepper knots (an easy cocktail treat) out of the oven. Finally, the book is filled with practical advice and hints on cooking, cookware, and just eating well. This book is definitely worth the purchase for anyone who wants to learn more about olive oil or to explore Mediterranean cooking."
5,My new favorite cookbook,Every recipe I've tried from this book has become a new favorite. The flavor combinations all have at least a slightly new twist. The general information and narrative is entertaining and informative. This book is a little treasure.
4,Not a bad buy...,"Ordered on 2/24/10. Came in on 2/27/10. Awesome time on shipping. Knife is sharp as heck. Sheath is ok. Theres a healthy sounding click when the knife is settled in. As with the other reviews, it wont slip out when you hold it upside down and shake it. I wish the sheath had a full loop but its only a standard clip on. Its the only reason I didnt give it a 5 star. Probably look online for a leather sheath. It'll be my fishing knife/camping knife. Real great deal on a real good knife. You wont be disappointed."
1,Horrible Corrosion,Knife started to corrode and rust a week after I received it despite proper cleaning and drying. Very sharp blade which field dressed a quail nicely but cannot recommend to others after such a lousy product life.
2,its ok,well overall i like the knife. But i haven't even gotten the knife wet and it is getting surface rust already. but good knife other wise.
5,Great book!,I've had all 3 editions and they just keep getting better and better. This is absolutely the best book around for wade and kayak fishing the Galveston area. The pictures are great and the maps are accurate. I was raised fishing in that area and this books shows places I never knew existed. The information in Ray's book is priceless.
2,Too Little Content,I have tried The Times for two weeks and was hoping I wouldn't miss what was left out of the Kindle edition. I love having reading the paper on the Kindle but the content is just too light. I am a huge supporter of independent media and was excited to support a delivery mechansim that has the potential to increase access. I wish The Times would make the Kindle content more closely match the print version as promised in the description. I will not be continuing my Kindle subscription.
4,Nice but too expensive,I just did the 2 week trial on my new K3. Enjoyed the content but the price needs to be closer to $5 a month before I'll come back. The Times and Amazon are competing with public domain e-book management programs that can provide the same service for free. I'd prefer to support the paper and pay but the price needs to come down to something more reasonable.
4,Works for Me,"Paper is ready for me in the morning. I like the way it's boiled down to the articles and I don't have to cart papers to the trash.Articles are well organized and the Kindle is great as a reader.Simply amazing. As for the weather it's on the TV, my computer, and out my window."
1,"Way to much, price gouging","Tried the kindle version, was alright. It was a pain navigating around and also isn't as complete as the print edition. For $120 a year it's just not worth the cost. I'd buy it if it was around $1-$2 a month, but for $10 a month??????? Give me a break"
2,Less than a Newspaper,"I just received a Kindle 3 and the first thing I did was look for the local papers. I found the Seattle Times and instantly began my free trial.At first it seemed like an awesome way to get the paper in a convenient and more eco-friendly way. For ten bucks a month you get the newspaper delivered to your Kindle every day.What you do not know is you get The Seattle Times lite. You get a handful of stories only. Almost no photos or captions. Only major catagories. How useful would the job section be right now?This paper would be great if it was only three bucks. Right now, it is a rip off."
1,Terrible excuse for an e-edition,Anyone have PressReader for iPad ? They know how to do E editions that look like the ACTUAL newspaper. This is missing so many sections-big shame.
3,It is better once to try...,"Beautiful Asian folks kicked and punch each other mercilessly for reasons completely misiunderstandable too frequently while trying to get plates (counterfeited?) of the US hundred dollar note in right hands.It is something like an Asian version of ""Charlie's Angels"" much lacking of sexism, regrettably."
3,Entertaining film,"It's a Chinese action film that of course seems as a fantasy. However, it's entertaining and girls are pretty good looking to watch."
4,Great Advanced Soldiering book!,"This book is excellent information for any soldier. Although the title is misleading. The book talks about special forces around the world and their fighting skills. I found some good information even though I am a fully qualified soldier. I saw a few reviews that said it was a bad book if you were looking for ""fighting skills"" as in street fighting. The fact of the matter is the whole book is on fighting. Fighting wars and Battle skills that is. If a person is looking for a unarmed combat system I suggest Systema. For more info. go to www.russianmartialart.com"
3,Things not seen,(...)I am in 8th grade.I just read Things Not Seen by Andrew Clements.My opinion of this books that its full of surprizes and twsts.Like when Bobby's parents get into a car crach and the police try to find Bobby.I thought th best part of the book was when Bobby was sneaking around the Sears tower.I felt the ending was unexcpting and exciting.When the cops barged in the house and fund him naked.I recommend this.You will be excited and stunned with all the challenges Bobby has to go through.
4,Invisible,Looking for a great book then read about a boy who mysteriously becomes invisible one morning. Then he meets a blind girl and together they find a way to help him.
3,Things Not Seen by Andrew Clements,"Things Not Seen was a pretty good book. It was a little weird. The title also sounds weird. But if you want to read it, then go ahead. I am not going to stop you."
4,FABULOUS BOOK! READ THIS REVIEW!,"I recommend this book to anyone who likes to sit back, relax, and read for fun. In this book, Bobby Phillips (the main character) turns invisible but we all know that really couldn't happen. This book is thrilling and makes you want to keep reading and never stop. Each chapter gets one step closer to figuring out how Bobby suddenly turned invisible. If I had a choice to read just one book again, I would choose to read this one. Things Not Seen is an adventurous, heartwarming story that will be loved by readers everywhere. You have to read this book!"
1,Things Not Seen,"This book was fairly good.It was very good at the beginning and had an awesome plot, but I dont think the author pulled through in the middle.It seemed to move very slow.I did like how creative the author was by how he made Bobby the main character get around town, being invisible in all.I would not recommend this book to anyone. I give this book one star."
5,Things not seen,This is my rewveiw of things not seen. I liked this book because it was funny and a mystery. It is about a boy who wakes up one morning and finds that he cant see him self. What he try's to do is shocking at the end. I recommend this book to any one. I did not like this book because I don't like mystery books. I hope you like it.
3,Growing less interested in Precious Ramotswe's tale...,"While McCall's sixth in the Ladies Detective Agency series has all the traits of the first; relaxing simplicity, rich descriptions, delightfully gentle prose and bush tea, I find myself enjoying each work less and less.Though it is still exceptionally reader, the characters have steadily become less appealing. Perhaps it is because the novelty of their simplified responses has worn off. I think moreover, I enjoyed the focus on the detective stories, and this element of McCall's work has taken a backseat for character tribulations.Still, a Sunday afternoon and four cups of tea can melt away happily with this simple and gentle little narrative. As long as the book is borrowed and one doesn't expect some dramatic life change or to remember the work in a week."
3,cheapest out there but still way to expensive,"After shopping around on the web and med. supply stores in the area, we found this model to be the least expensive and the best functioning. Very pricy for just a piece of thick latex though"
1,Seriously? How did this book get such good reviews?,"I used to be such a fan of Diana Palmer, although she has more misses than hits for me..certain books I just absolutely love and make up for the bad ones, but MY GOODNESS! This book was HORRIBLE and incredibly BORING. The way she writes is just so mundane and many parts of the dialogue were completely unnecessary. I have no idea when this was written, but having just bought this book (the reprint), it's like reading about something way out of my time without any of the charm of old school romance or likeable characters. I never connected with the book nor did I sympathize with these ""situations"" that the main characters went through. JUST AWFUL!"
5,This is a must have!!,Very pleased with my new hedgetrimmer! Have used it twice and was soo much fun and easy. Going to order another one for my step-dad for Christmas. It also comes into a case for the blades to slide into. The trimmer is very light and cuts very easy. Not one thing I would change about this product. Thanks!!
5,Great Product,This is a wonderful product. I have the other Black and Decker 18 volt cordless pieces also. I have already used it and it worked great. I cut down the dried tall papas gras without any problem at all and being a woman this really did help. I look forward to using it all summer.
4,B&D hedge trimmer,"Very well designed product. Light, well balanced, easy to use.We had an earlier model that was 14.4 volts but this 18 volt unit is far superior.As usual, buying the new unit was cheaper than replacing the batteries on the old one.This unit handled all of our shrubs with no problem and is lightweight enough for my wife to use."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"Excellent songs - bad sound. Some songs are very soft and some are just soft. When listening, I have to contantly turn the volume up and down. I would not recommend this."
1,Batteries die after one season,"Conceptually this is a good product. No gas, no extension cord. The first season I used it it was fine. After the first winter the batteries ran down and had noticeably less capacity. By the middle of season two, the two batteries wouldn't make it through my relatively small yard. The charger went up in a puff of smoke and that was it. I now have a powered weed eater(NOT Black and Decker) that cost $40 plus the extension cord. It takes me half the time to do the same yard because the rpm of this unit is way faster than the B&D cordless and it keeps the rpm the entire time. It is also weigh about half as much."
4,A powerful edger,This the second one of this type I have bought. The last won lasted 6 years. This is better than the last one. More power and lighter too.
1,Junk,I bought this B&D; trimmer last summer (2006) and it's been a great disappointment. It came with 2 batteries but even with them both fully charged I can't get my whole normal sized yard done. This is the second cordless B&D; trimmer I've owned. The first I bought at Home Depot or Lowes in the spring of 2002. It was phenonemal. I could trim my nearly 1.5 acre yard (old house) on one battery. That's no exageration. It did such a fine job that when that when it kicked the bucket I replaced it with the current model.It's possible I got a bad unit. But if I had it to do over again I wouldn't buy this trimmer.
1,Worthless & Cheaply Made,I returned this after the first use. No power at all & long charge time with a very short battery life. Not good for anything but very fine grass in a very small area. I bought an American Gardener YS24 YardStick 10-Inch 24-V for the same price & am extremely happy with that trimmer. Don't waste your time & money on this Black & Decker. I expected a lot more out of Black & Decker.
5,Great Product,"I got this trimmer a few days ago. Love it. I put it together in 5 minutes and have it used it a couple times already. It is light weight, but really does a great job. I love that it is so portable, no cords, no gas! I brought this to the cemetary and it did a fantastic job edging and cleaning up around the family headstones.The battery seemed to have no problem working for a good 1/2 hour and appeared to have plenty of charge left. I really like that this came with 2 batteries. Definitely recommend it!"
4,"Cordless 12 in. , 18 volt Black & Decker String trimmer","Trimmer so convenient. Just take it out of the shed, hit the switch and you are trimming. I like the choice of trimmer or edger.However the diameter of the nylon line is too light. It can only handle grass and light weeds. It would be more verstile if it could also handle coarser weeds.The 12 in. wide protective cover over the trimmer is too cumbersome and blocks yur view a lot of the time. I cannot work the trimmer with that protective cover on. It should be half that size or smaller.Have been using weed eaters for many years so have past experience to compare this line trimmer to."
4,Not Heavy Duty- But Does the job,"Works well, not a weed wacker per se, but good for trimming grass in areas the mower won't reach. The batttery life is pretty good for a cordless tool, I use both to get my large yard done and keep them charging on a timer during the week. No major complaints"
3,"Good, but still has problems!","The one I bought was a reconditioned one, from a link from this site, returnable only if not used, So I used it and the auto feed worked ok the 1st time the second, it went crazy to the point that I could not use it, So my fix was to take the line and unwind it to be able to loop throu the hole they use for packaging and then out the exit hole, so no auto feed, I carry clippers and then just cut back to were it needs to be, generally it works good for one charge. When the battery gets lower it is hard for it to cut through tough weeds and harder grasses, like bermuda. I have fescue and it works really good for all the trimming that I do with it. I have the 18v trimmer so between the 2 I have 3 batteries to use."
3,Get what you pay for,"Ordered this based on other reviews. I currently have a Gas Power Ryobi trimmer and was just getting to be a hassle(Not starting quickly, the line feed problems, etc.). So decided to try this one out. The first charge took over 8 hours (each battery). The charging light does not turn off after the charge is complete so no indication at all. The full charge lasted me approx 15 minutes (there was still charge left but totally useless becuase it was not trimming the grass). So far the price I paid it wasn't too bad. I didn't realize this only had a single string. I would have paid more for a better one."
4,review black & decker,The Black & decker Cordless Trimmer is great to have. I used theproduct 6 times since I got and did better than one I have before.Now I go places where I did go before when I electric cord trimmer.I would rcommend this product everyone even people who have gas trimmer.Less depend on gasoline and more electric.
5,Weeds beware,I love this product. It came with 2 batteries. Battery works for 2 hours before needing to be recharged. It's lighter than gas powered and more convenient than electric.
4,Good for small jobs,I purchased the Grasshog 12 inch 18V cordless trimmer mainly for the ease of use and the fact that I have 5 other tools using the same 18V batteries. The trimmer is pretty good when you just begin with a new battery. However 10 minutes later after cutting some medium heiht grass the battery starts to wear down quickly and cannot cut anything at that point. You must keep switching batteries to complete the trimming. I use approximately 2 to 3 full charges of batteries each time I trim. It is good for small areas or very light work but does not have the continuous muscle to do heavy weeded areas or large lots.
4,"decent product, unsupported by B&D",Battery life and product power are 100% of what I need for my suburban lot. Plastics feel a bit cheap so will see how this holds up. Product documentation is abysmal. Technical drawings for set up are incomplete and leave you guessing. Documentation on the batteries is incomplete. Charger has no informative indicators. Documentation does not specify as to how long batteries need to charge nor as to whether batteries left in charger go on standby and can be left indefinitely. It is unclear what other battery products from B&D can be used interchangeably. The B&D website offers zero customer support either from faq or from email.
2,Battery life,"The battery life is extremly small. It says that the fully charged battery is good for 7-8 hours, but it lasted only 20-30 min."
2,Not enough charge for even a moderately-sized lawn.,"As with other products I have used with Black & Decker's proprietary batteries, this weed whacker just doesn't hold its charge long enough to be useful. I have two batteries: the one that came with the unit and a spare. One battery is defective and only holds a charge for about 2 minutes tops. The other batter holds a charge for roughly ten minutes, which is just not long enough to get all of my weekly weed whacking done. I like the idea of a cordless, electric weed whacker. Gas-powered units are a real pain to use, and my lawn is too big to reach everywhere with an extension cord. Still, this particular unit just doesn't get the job done."
4,Cordless weed whacker,"I really like the trimmer, and I got it because of the size and the two batteries. I still must have too much to trim, because one battery is not enough, and I have to wait until the next day for the other battery to be fully charged. I will just have to buy another charger, or another product with batteries and charger included."
1,I'll never own another Black and Decker!,"In the last few years, every single Black and Decker product I've purchased has broken, burnt out, or flat fell apart in just one season! Bought this weed eater last season and the string feeder constantly falls apart and winds up wasting half a dang roll of string. It's the most ill conceived piece of junk I've ever seen. After going through 6 rolls and 2 replacement heads, it's in the garbage it goes! Please note that this is used around the house only. Do yourself a favor and try another brand!"
3,black and decker 18 volt string trimmer,battery doesn't last very log and recharge takes to long even with 2 battries The power is ok and works ok otherwise.
3,Good trimmer...short battery,"I just recently purchased this trimmer and its batteries. While the cordless feature is very handy for getting my fence and trees trimmed away from the house, the batteries didn't last very long after their initial charge. I will keep the trimmer for the outlying areas, but I have purchased another ""electric"" trimmer to get the job done around the house. Probably an exceptional product for very small yards, but not what I envisioned for mine."
1,Not worth it,"I have this product for the last six years. The is is a very basic low power trimmer. The spools are way more expensive than other brands. Considering I use up 2+ spools each time trimming my lawn, the cost comes very close to the cost of getting the lawn mowed by professionals.Avoid this product."
2,Battery life stinks,"The edger is lightweight and very easy to use. However, I had both batteries charged and still only got the back side of the house and about 40 ft further. They need to make better batteries!!!!"
4,NO MORE EXTESION CORD,I love this product it works great for my needs [single family home] no more extension cord.Price was fair it got here the next day I am very satisfied.
4,Light and efficient trimmer,"Only used it twice, but it works effortlessly and is unexpectedly light weight. Does a very good job trimming and is easy to use with the auto string feed with no-more tapping!"
4,Still using it after almost 3 years.,"I bought this to trim my decent sized front yard and my fairly large backyard. It just barely survives doing both on a single battery. If my yard was just a little smaller it would be perfect. I still get the lion's share of the trimming done before the battery dies. I usually switch to the new battery right before I use it and then place the other one on the charger. That keeps one fully charge and ready to go when I need it. It's a lot lighter and quieter than a gas powered trimmer and I appreciate not having one more thing to keep full of gas.It's not for large yards and heavy duty trimming, but if you just need something that does good enough and lasts then this is the trimmer for you."
3,Works fine but batteries don't last,"I have had this item for about 6 years and it still works! The weak link is the battery. When the trimmer was new, I could barely finish my 1/4 acre lot trimming on a battery charge, which was tolerable. However, after the second season, the batteries that came with the trimmer are nearly worthless. They just don't hold a charge. If you buy a replacement, the cost is 2/3 of the cost of a new weed eater."
2,Awful battery run time,"This cordless trimmer will suffice for extremely small yards (think townhomes) without thick growth needing to be trimmed. This unit comes with two batteries, but both batteries need to be FULLY charged before starting a project. If you start a project, and place a charged battery in the trimmer, and a discharged battery in the charger, you will have about 20 minutes of runtime on the first battery, and will have at least another 45 minutes to wait before the second battery is ready for use."
3,moderately effective trimmer,"To highlight the pluses and minuses of this trimmer:Pluses include that it's cordless, lightweight, and has a auto feed mechanism on the trimming line.Minuses include no telescoping shaft in contradiction to what is listed on the features here; poor assembly instructions - had to go to the local Home Depot to see how the handle was screwed on; and weak ability to cut through thick weeds and grass as mentioned in the previous review.Would recommend mostly for light use in a relatively small yard."
4,The best I've tried,"I have purchased 3 other electric trimmers over the years, and this one is by far the best. It takes me so much less time to trim my yard because I do not have to turn the unit upside down constantly and pull the string out so that it will work. I never thought that I would enjoy weed-eating, but this trimmer makes it so easy that it is a pleasure!The only reason I took off one star is that the trimmer is a little heavy for me. I weigh 100 pounds, so for someone who is bigger it would probably not be a problem. My yard is small, but my arms were dead after trimming it. However, I am more than willing to accept this since the trimmer does such a great job overall."
5,Black&Decker cordless string trimmer/edger,"Excellent product. Have used it several times and am totally pleased. Battery lasts long enough to do my large yard without having to use second one. Also, same battery can be used on my B&D hedge trimmer so I always have enough power in reserve."
4,Grasshog cordless review,"Overall it is a nice piece of equipment; easy to handle both as a trimmer and edger. It does a nice job. The only complaint is that the battery doesn't last a long time. I have a fairly small yard, but the battery does not last long enough to edge and trim both the front and back yard. Thank goodness they provide two batteries!"
3,Cordless grasshog,"This product works quite well but as the other reviews I read the batteries don't last very long but my biggest issue is with the string feed, I was using it last night and the string flew off the 3 seperate peices one hit by my eye and 3 on my legs, my face was bleeding and I have cuts on my legs from the other 3 pieces and I was wearing long pants and boots."
5,It Works Great!,"I have used a noisy gas powered edger for years, until someone showed me the Grasshog. It's quiet, has 2 batteries so you can do even a fairly large lawn without having to stop and recharge. It does a great job trimming along fence lines and around trees, etc. It does a good job edgeing as long as you aren't trying to cut through dirt that has built up. What it is not is a trimmer for heavy duty brush or lot's of edging. For a normal homeowner, it's great!!"
4,A Good String Trimmer,"Purchased as a refurbished product, the trimmer's performance is adequate for my needs--I trim roughly 350 feet of grass edges. The two batteries it came with was more than sufficient(one battery charge or less for the edge trimming I do). Surprisingly though the trimmer arrived like it was new--don't know what they had to refurbish with this one.Having an extra battery affords me to do some hedge trimming, yes hedges too because of the lightweight feature of the trimmer. I'm happy with the purchase."
5,"Handy, convenient, and works nice too!","I like this trimmer best of any I've owned. No chord to mess with is GREAT, cuts nice, the auto line feed works well (I do find it hard to remember not to tap to feed the line, old habits die hard!)"
2,Weak,"I got the trimmer along with the blower and hedge trimmer. If you are looking to trim anything thicker than a blade of grass, this isn't for you. It struggled with trimming my driveway and children's playset. I stopped using after a few triesOn the positive side, the battery seemed to last long and the blower and hedge trimmer work great."
1,Zero Stars For Dull,"Do not listen to the film buffs who call this ""art"" and a series of vignettes that defy any meaning, its worthless and boring. The whole film has no interest to offer, what it tends to portray is stuffy French poseurs who smoke and talk about nothing in particular, that isn't very entertaining. I was dragged to the ending finally and was exhausted by the absolute uselessness of this picture and of Godard himself who isn't a very capable film director."
1,total rip-off; misleading title,"This album is a total rip-off. I am a great fan of Enrico, and grew up with his music. I was excited to see this CD with remixes of old time favorites, and I immediately purchased it. I was extremely disappointed to find out that the CD is nothing more than an bunch of annoying, undescribable beats with occasional synthesized melodies of Enrico in the background. I returned the CD for a refund. Don't buy it!"
5,More than five stars...,"I wish there was some way to rate this above five stars because this book is definitely worthy of more. This book is about Lara Stone who decides to go along with her husband's request to have a baby and ends up pregnant. The only thing is; she really doesn't like kids since she works with them on a daily basis at a prep school. As the book goes on, she discovers that she really has a ""motherly"" instinct in her. This book made me laugh many different times which is really hard to do since I don't laugh while reading books. I found that I related to her well. I have an 18 month old daughter, but am really not a kid person; except of course with her, and a lot of the things she said reminded me of things I've said. It's a really fun read and I highly recommend it."
5,The author rules.,"If you think for any reason that this book is for you, then you won't be disappointed. Authoritatively written, well illustrated, and outright fascinating."
2,Needs To Be Updated,"To be fair, this book is over 3 years old. Of course it will have outdated information. At the time this was written the W3C wasn't sure which direction to go. That alone leaves lots of issues up in the air. I got this book 2 years ago and it was helpful then but I came back here looking for an updated version and did not see one. If you are new to DHTML this book will be less helpful than more recent ones."
1,Poor. Companion website misleading.,Don't buy this book!!!! Says it comes with a companion website which appears to be nothing more than an advertisement for other books!! In order to use the online versions of Teach yourself Javascript and VBscrpt That are on the companion web site you have to buy the books.
1,Only for Explorer,"The nicely laid out examples work only in Internet Explorer. The authors have no clue. This is book is a waste of time, as it doesn't address cross browser functionality of DHTML. If you're a professional stay away from this book. The irresponsible publisher should be held accountable."
3,"Oops, I destroyed it on the first use.","I like every other Zyliss utensil that I own, and this spatula seemed like a nice product. However, the first time I used it I propped it on the rim of my frying pan and it promptly melted."
2,"Different sort of album, different sort of response","I was very excited for this album as ""Scorpio Rising"" and ""Ambassadors of Style"" are two exceptional works. Hearing ""Road To Benares"" off of Thievery's AOL Music DJ Sessions got me even more excited. But, when it actually arrived I was quite disappointed. It is very much a departure from their usual style. It still has a very 70's movie feel but almost every track has vocals. I found most tracks uninspired, or at least not what you'd come to expect. The two exceptions are ""Road To Benares"" and ""Lost Vagueness"" which are both excellent songs. So for right now I'll hold on dearly to their first two albums and hope for another strong effort next time."
5,"Outstanding, Blistering, Relentless, With Driving, Oddly Timed Beats","I LOVE this disc. Its completely abrasive and LOUD, blistering walls of analog noise with oddly times beats; a riot of noise which, though seemingly chaotic, almost freejazz-y, is actually carefully composed (though Akita is also a master improviser).That being said, this is literally noise; manipulated rhythm loops, analog synth blasts, feedback, whitenoise, and distortion. It's not electronica (though I reckon you could dance to it in some kindof contorted apocalyptic spasmatic way with lots of thrashing, screaming, and fist pounding), so if thats what you're looking for, look elsewhere.Definitely an acquired taste, and not for everybody. But, as a friend once said, ""if this is the kind of stuff you're into, you'll be REALLY into this."""
2,Not what I expected,"This item seemed like a great idea, but it was not what I had expected. I have a 2 and 4 year old and I was hoping to have something that I could press a button if I didn't see them and the watch would beep. However, the kids would have to press 2 buttons on either side of the watch when they realize that they are missing. This is not easy for kids that age to accomplish, plus, it is basically useless if someone grabs them. This might be a great tool for older children if they get lost somewhere, but it is not effective at all for young children. There is a product called, Mommy, I'm Here, that seems to look like what I need. It attaches to the child's clothing and comes with a keychain for Moms to press and emits a loud beep when activated. We'll see!"
1,More than one edition of this book,Note that there are at least 3 editions of this book. Check for the latest edition if you want the latest.
4,Great CSS Book for everyone,"I'd certainly recommend this book to any web designer, from beginner to advanced. It contains plenty of examples to help you through the tricky parts, but is also great as a reference book. My wife originally bought this book for herself, but I opened the parcel and read it for her. I just consider myself very considerate."
3,Love this freaking thing but batteries don't last,"I bought this just under 2 years ago. It came with charger and 2 batteries.. It usually takes both batteries power to finish up whatever i'm doing.. I use this literally every day in my house! I have all tile floors and 5 cats. Cats tails are like dust mops, they bring in every small stick, leaf and every thing else and deposit it across the floor. One fo the first things I do everyday is open the front door and blow out every damn thing they dragged in.Sadly with time the batteries were lasting less and less time. I charge them every day then store them in a drawer (not the hot garage) butthey've totaly quit charging now. So I'll try to replace the batteries.. I'm not even sure if I need a new charger too... I'm disappointed these batteries wore out so quickly. 'that's too big an expense to replace so often.As for the blower itself it is very light weight and easy to use."
2,Hope you like sweeping,"This device is perfect for people who love charging batteries and love manually sweeping stuff with an old-fashioned, human-powered broom. Because you'll end up doing both quite a bit if you buy this device.I wanted to love this device and have lots of other decent black and decker 18v stuff (I like their weed-whacker). But this thing is so frustrating because the blower is not strong enough and only lasts 2.5 minutes.Mine came with two batteries. Each battery, fully charged, lasts about 2-3 minutes. It's kind of surreal. Even if the batteries kept up, this broom is not strong enough to blow piles of leaves off my driveway and deck. I still have to break out the regular broom and sweep.I have a small deck (<75square feet) and can't even use this to blow off a few leaves.That being said, my kids love blowing it at each other and since the blowing power is so weak I don't have to worry about them harming each other."
2,It's OK,"It's OK. It does a good job for small areas. The air stream is not as strong as my electric cord blower, but is OK for porches and decks. Fortunately, there are two battery packs, so one is being charged while using the other. This is important as one charge doesn't last long. All in all, the convenience of no cords to mess with makes this a good buy."
4,Handy for small jobs,"I like this item for small jobs since the battery life is not long, I probably get 10-12 minutes out of a charge. Extra battery come in handy so I can finish any small job I started. It is nice and light so it is easy to work with."
2,Doesnt last long,"B&D should really be honest about the charge times. As many have said, the plug free is convenient. But I just picked up a gas powered one for an extra 50 bucks, and its like a new lease on life. This machine has about 10-15 of really strong blowing. After that, it wanes down to a soft blow in about 5 minutes. With all the hassle of having to remember to plug in the batteries (which die out over time), I am glad I picked up the gas one. I guess for a sidewalk cleaning or walkway it would be nice instead of having to do the daily sweep. But instead, go and try a gas powered one and you will be shocked at the difference. This one is pretty light, another pro."
2,only 15-20 minutes running time,"I have a fairly long driveway and using electrical extension cords are always a pain. I though a cordless blower would be a good option to clear our driveway of debris. The battery died after 15 minutes and I had only finished clearing half my driveway. I called B&D because the manual says to call the company before returning the product. ""Mam the blower only has 15 minutes of running time on that battery."" Had I known in advance I might not have purchased it. If you have a small yard, deck, driveway this might work for you. Didn't work for me. Another option is to have a backup battery so you can replace it as soon as the first one drains out of power."
4,need a relacement cherging cord,"I love my cordless broom,so handy for sweeping sidewalks.BUT the cord broke away from the charging unit.Can I purchase another cord?"
4,Lightweight and does the job,I've had this electric broom for about a year. It lacks the power of a corded blower but nonetheless it does the job for me. I use it to clean up the sidewalk and driveway after mowing the lawn or after a windy period leaves a mess. It works great and I can do my front yard and back yard areas on a single battery charge.I wouldn't recommend this for blowing leaves off a lawn as it may not have enough force to make that job easy. I don't own another blower and don't expect to because I don't feel I need to. In the fall when our trees drop their leaves we rake them.We now have four B&D; tools that use the same type of 18V battery. All four batteries are constantly in their charging stations so are always ready for use in any of the four tools. This is a successful design that is flexible for our use.
4,Long Battery Life,"This blower delivers exactly what I expected, only the battery life is surprisingly long- much longer than the old battery operated blower it replaced. Perhaps after a year or so of use the battery will not last as long, but so far I'm very pleased.OK folks- going on 2 years now and the battery is going strong!"
3,"cordless, but weak.","I bought this to replace my existing corded blower. It works great for light jobs like driveways, sidewalks, and patios. But this is certainly not strong enough to do your yard."
2,Black and Decker needs to offer a model with way more power,"I have a Black and Decker cordless mower and trimmer and I am extremely happy with both. They both have plenty of power and battery life is good.I wanted to be totally cordless so I get this blower. It is a joke.I won't return it because I only have a small front porch, driveway and patio to blow and it is OK, but I am extremely disappointed in the power and blowing capacity. It isn't even close to my old corded model. There is no excuse for this.It is adequacy only for small jobs blowing grass clippings on hard surfaces when there isn't much wind. It is good for my wife to use because it is so light.Black and Decker, please give us a model that is similar in blowing power/speed to a corded model."
1,Do not have product,"I ordered this product on May 4th, but I have not yet received it and this is June 6th, so I can't review the product."
3,So-so,"I ordered this product to clean bird seed off my back porch. It works if held close to the seed but I don't recommend it. It takes a l o n g time to charge the battery and it does not hold the charge as long as I expected. It is too big for a ""sweeper"". I usually like B&D products but this one, not so much."
3,B:& D a little short on power,"Good concept, great weight, easy to use, not enough consistent power. Need to improve to become consistently useful."
1,Awful battery life,"Manufacturer claims a 15 minute battery life. I bought a NEW Red battery but it worked for about 5 minutes, and less than 10 minutes after a 24-hour recharge cyle. I bought because of the B&D reputation, and my good experience with other products, but this is a real dud."
2,The Battery is Worthless!,"The blower seems decent, however what kills this product is the battery. I only used the blower four times, and then after that the battery could not hold a charge. Unfortunately I'm past the return policy date or else I would return it. I'm so dissapointed in this product."
1,two down,"my first lasted 4 yrs, addmittedly was happy but it finally died. bought new one 38 days agao from amazon. it is now howling as if fan is out of balance. only matter of time before it dies and anyways, too annoying to use. only used it a couple times. cannot return due to 30 day only time windowexpiring few days ago. fairly infuriating. i hate to give bad review on this blower - i thought it was actually pretty good and was looking forward to another 4 years with the new one i got. total bummer."
2,Save your Money,"Doesn't hold a charge very long at all, weak, noisy, bottom-heavy, and too wheezy to blow anything away except a pile of dead ants, and dry ones at that."
3,Bad Run Time,"I did a lot of research on cordless leaf blowers, and decided that theB&D; NS118 would be the best. One of the most important factors that I did not see on the specs nor did I inquire about was the total run time on the blower before the battery ran down. I went ahead and purchased it. The first time I used it I was disappointed by the short run time. Turns out when I called the company I was told that it was about 12 minutes. If I had known this in the first place, I probably would not have purchased it."
2,Blower does nt have enough wind,"I have owned both gas and corded electric blowers over the years and I thought a cordless model would be a good idea. Unfortunately, this blower does not have enough wind power to blow the leaves and pine needles off my driveway. I would guess it has half the power of the corded Toro blower that it replaced."
1,Now comes with ONLY ONE BATTERY!,"Buyers beware! I have purchased two of these units previously and they came with two batteries. Black & Decker recently decided to delete one of the batteries from the unit and raise the price by about 5 bucks. It now comes with ONLY ONE BATTERY and it really needs two. Quite sneaky if you ask me. Some of the reviews here indicate the unit comes with two batteries. They are old reviews so buyers beware. The replacement batteries are quite expensive, do not last very long, and cost more than half the price of the unit. That's just silly. I would not buy this unit again."
4,good beginnersbook,This is an excellent book for the beginner knitter or crocheter with excellent descriptive pictures and reasons for recommendations. The importance of knitting a 4 inch gauge before starting the project. The size needles for the type of yarn.
5,Great Resource for Creative Yarnlovers,"I am an old crocheter and a new knitter, and this book is a great reference while creating my own little projects."
3,Check with local police before buying,"The light is very good and works fine as described. The package had the note 'Warning:May not be legal for street use. Check with local city/state ordinance'. Checked with local police and got the confirmation that it is not legal in VA. So, returned it for a full refund. Online product description should include this information. Product doesn't have DOT/SAT approval engraved."
4,It works,"Had one for several years and dropped a tool box on it. This is the same unit except the cord/plug assembly is 6 inches shorter than the first and does not reach the light connector on the bumper. Had to buy a cord extension to get it connected. For the price, the cord could have been left longer. Otherwise product is as advertised."
1,A superb work of romance...watch out Di Blasio & Tesh!!,"Voila! Romance at its maximum expression. This masterpiece is better than a roller-coaster ride! It's more like a rocket trip! When you think you're as ""high"" as you will get, you go even ""higher"". Oh what a feeling! I invite you to experience the most refreshing musical production I have heard in a very long time! Enjoy! Gracias Rick!! Es magnifico!!!!"
5,It soothes to the soul!,"The very first time I listened to it, I felt like I was being taken away to a mystical land of dreams and fantasies. My personal favorite is the song "" More than Words."" It fits the piece of music perfectly! Rick Silanskas, You have touched my life and the lives of many others."
1,the horrible pinball game,THis game is terrible- its graphics are horrible and it is defiantly to bad of a game
4,good watch/heart rate monitor and cal counter,"I have had my watch for almost a year now and it still works really well. It needs new batteries here and there. I check that first when it starts acting up. That has always helped any problems I had. I would have given it 5 stars, but it is really hard to change the battery on the wrist watch. My husband has to help me with it every time. We have only changed that part twice in the year I have had it. I use it alot. I go to the gym at least 5 times a week and work out anywhere from an hour to 2 hours. I would recommend this watch to anyone who wants calorie/heart rate information during their workout. It also tells you your highs and lows of your heart rate during the workout. I think a great price for all that information."
2,Didn't work well for me.,"Timex T5G971 heart monitor (1) Wouldn't read my heart rate reliably even when watch portion very close to chest. My old Polar watch portion read the Timex chest transmitter just fine. (2) When I got it to respond (wet the band more), the Timex read low rates compared to my old Polar, both reading same chest transmitter. 3) The Timex was much slower to respond to exercise heart-rate increases - up to a minute - than to my old Polar."
1,Annoying Beep,The chest strap emits an annoying beep every time my heart beats. This feature is fine except that you can't turn it off..WTF!?!? I don't want people thinking that I am a walking bomb while I am out exercising. I'm probably going to return this for that reason alone.
5,Smartest purchases I have ever made,For the price this product holds it s value for me. I verified the accuracy of this HRM compared to Garmin HRM products and was pleasantly surprised that the Timex was very similar in the HRM and Calories burned calculation. I understand that this can never be 100% accurate but it is very close for less $50 bucks. I highly recommend this for beginners or people who are just looking fo rcheap but accurate solution for HRM and calories burned.
4,love the watch,"Like the watch alot, very easy to work and set up.Only bad thing is if you're female the watch band is big andyou may have to put it in the smallest hole to fit your wrist.Love that it counts calories."
5,Great Heart Rate Monitor,This is my first heart rate monitor and I love it. It's easy to use and works great so far. Really glad I bought this to help track my workouts with more detail. Thanks
2,"Worked well for 8 months, but now very hard to get a signal.","The watch still works, but the sensor belt is pretty much dead, even with a brand new battery and electrode gel. I guess 8 months is good for these things? I don't know whether to buy another one (dif maker definitely) or what...I just want something that last for 2 years at least and tell me heart rate and time."
2,Not impressed,"If there's anyone within four or five feet of me in a gym that is also wearing a heart monitor, mine becomes messed up. So the only time this monitor can work is if I am biking or running by myself. I bought this for the price, but the old saying, ""you get what you pay for"" is never more true in this instance. I've always enjoyed my Timex triathlon stop watch, but they have a ways to go with their heart monitors."
2,Seldom worked!,"Despite following the directions to carefully wed the transmitter/chest strap, the ""watch' seldom established contact with the transmitter. I even tried conducting ""gel"" to no avail. I gave up and returned the monitor."
4,Timex low-end heart monitor watch,Works okay. All I wanted was a heart rate monitor. No other bells or whistles. So far it's doing what I wanted. (I've had it for only a few weeks.)
2,Not For Women,"This a good heart rate monitor. However, it assumes that you are a man and burn calories just like a man. Women do not burn them as efficiently. That being the case, please reconsider if you are a woman looking for a heart rate monitor to help you keep track of calories burned."
1,PRODUCT DAMAGED,I DOES NOT REGISTER THE HEART RATE. IT IS DAMAGED. I HAVE GOT THREE OF THESE WATCHES AND TWO WERE DAMAGED. YOU MUST NOT SALE THIS KIND OF JUNK GOODS. IT IS VERY DISTRESFUL.
1,This item sucks. Don't buy it,I should have gone on line before I bought this. It is really hard to set and the manual is no help. Don't waste your money.
2,Heart Monitor Review,It is just okay. I believe it was previously used. The box had been opened. I should have returned it. I really needed to use it for a class I had enrolled in. Would not order again.
1,"Worked Well for a While, Then Failed","The Timex heart rate monitor worked well for about a year, then failed. I put in a new battery, but the monitor still would not work."
2,Fell for it twice,"I first purchased one of these HRM's because it got decent reviews and it had a calorie counter. The first one lasted about a year before the strap stopped sending my heart rate to the watch (I changed the batteries and everything). I figured that I would buy another one because the first one lasted a year, and hopefully the second would be better...I was wrong. I've had this second one since May and it now only accurately keeps my HR for about a half hour, then it goes to about 30-50bpm and nothing else until I use it a couple days later."
5,"Easy to use, works great!","For the price compared to other units, this one works fine and was fairly simple to use. Has lasted and still going strong."
3,Good entry monitor,It works as described. Numbers are easy to see. Button is easy to use. As has been stated in other reviews it arrived with a dead battery in the sensor. I spent a couple hours reading and trying the monitor before realizing that mine had had arrived with a dead battery as well. It is very irritating to need to drive around looking for a battery to try the new monitor after trying to use the convenience of Amazon to make the purchase. Timex could remove include the battery separately or include a second battery. But it is working well now and I am happy with the functionality.
4,My first pulse sensor,"This being my first pulse sensor I'd say it works great. The chest band is a little uncomfortable, but I imagine all the pulse sensors are like this. I did have to wet the sensors to get it to work, but that is what the directions say you have to do. It's a Timex, so I know I have a product that will last a long time. The strap for the sensor should be able to be detached so it can be washed and I do not like the idea of having to step into the sensor or put it over my head. It should have a latch. Good product."
1,I would not buy this product again!,"I paid $45.00 from Amazon.com, I think the list price was $60.00. The heart monitor was 20 points off! That's unacceptical if you're using it to check your pulse rate. The watch part worked fine! I had it in my possesion for about 2 days when one of the push buttons poped off during a walk! I tried to return it to Amazon.com but I was one day late. I called Timex and they were very helpful. I sent it back to them for repair or replacement (I had to pay shipping) they actually sent me a better one (T5H911) This one lists at $100.00 and is available on line for about $69.00. The heart monitor is right on. So far this one works fine after 2 weeks. Timex sent me my old manual back so I had to down load the correct manual for this watch. Personally, I will never buy another thing from Amazon.com. Never had any problems with anyone else on the internet as far as products or returns."
4,Heart Rate Monitor,I am very pleased with this product. The results of the usage as indicated is accurate. Very comfortable to wear and at times I forget I even have it on. I would reccommend this product to family and friends.
2,Said i burned way too many calories. Not true information. Heart rate works great.,"Wore this to a 90 minute spin class and it said I burned 1800 calories. I work hard, but that is pretty impossible. Returning this."
3,ok product,"This is a good monitor for the price . There is one downside on this, and that is that it does not have a stopwatch ."
1,Watch failure,"I read all the reviews before ordering this watch. The good vs bad reviews were almost 50/50 so I thought I would give this watch a try. Wrong! It worked for just 6 months and then went crazy. I thought it just needed a new battery and had that changed. It still didn't work so I just assume it is broken. I read the reviewer who said Timex wanted shipping plus a fee to repair and return. I can probably get a new watch for the same amount plus hassle factor. I will just buy another watch but you can bet it WON'T be Timex. To end on a semi-positive note, the unit did function perfectly until it quit! I love the aspect of the monitor to rate my workouts and track them. I will buy another monitor, just not Timex."
1,You get what you pay for,"My wife bought this for me as a gift. It worked great for about 6 months, then stopped working. It has worked only intermittently since then. I've replaced the battery in the chest strap and the wrist monitor. I was about to buy a new one last week, tried this out one last time, and it worked, but only while I was sitting at the computer. I tried it again tonight for my workout and it would not sync up. I popped the battery out of the chest strap and re-adjusted the battery, but it did not work.Also, one strap of the wrist band popped off. We took it to a watch repair shop and they were unable to get the wrist band back on. This is due to the poor design of the pin holes for the watch strap.So, I have a monitor that I can't wear on my wrist and the chest band won't sync back to the monitor. It was great for 6 months, but was made to break too soon. I'm going to buy another heart monitor, but not this brand. You may have better luck."
3,Just okay.,"While it works okay once you get it on and programmed. It is the programming that is quite difficult to set and use. Cumbersome hard to follow directions on setting this item up. Can't say, because Amazon wants a review rather quickly, how it will hold up over time."
4,Timex Heart Monitor - Easy to use,I'm loving it!Easy to use.The band is okay. I worried that it would bug me but it's not bad and I forget I'm wearing it.
1,The devil's in the details,"I was about to purchase this heart rate monitor simply because of the ""365 day no hassle return"". That would nullify any of the reviews that stated it stopped working after a month or so. However, I took the time to read the return policy because ""restrictions apply"". The restrictions? You can return it IF it's in the original box, and.... IT HASN'T BEEN USED OR WORN. I decided not to purchase it because the seller obviously thinks no one will read the details. I guess if you don't use it or wear it, it will keep right on ticking. The policy is laughable, so the product is highly suspect."
1,Worked for only 5 minutes :(,"I already have a Garmin 305 that I LOVE and never had a problem with. I bought this after reading consumer review as a best buy and just wanted a HRM for when I am in the gym to see how many calories I am burning (which the Garmin cannot do indoors) I took it out of the box and wet the sensors and heard a strange beeping from the chest strap that was loud. I noticed the watch was only picking up my BPM sporadically so I thought it was the battery. Off to radio shack where they tested the battery and said it was a good battery so that wasn't the problem. Put the battery back in the sensor and now it won't work at all. Very disappointed! I was wondering why it was so cheap compared to the other watches and now I know. You get what you pay for! I will call Timex and try to get this returned. After seeing mostly good results on Amazon, I looked at the bad and seems a lot of people have the same issue I do so obviously a defective product."
2,Watch didn't hold up outdoors.,"Took it on a week long rafting trip through the Grand Canyon, and upon returning home, I realized that three of the four plastic buttons on the sides, had fallen apart and only the metal under them was OK. The watch still works, but it looks like h***, and it is now no longer usable for personal applications. I am very disappointed in this Timex product. It was supposed to be waterproof etc."
3,Monitor stopped working after 5 months,"The monitor worked well in the first few months of use, but stopped working after 5 months. I replaced the battery but it still did not work; so I'll have to send it out for repair."
5,Works like a charm!,"What can I say? It's made by Timex, so it's super accurate and easy to use. The heart strap fits comfortably around your chest, and secures easily. The watch size isn't to large or to small, it fits and looks just right. The numbers on the screen are large and easy to read. You can set the watch to beep if your heart rate setting falls to low or high out of your specs, or you can set it to silent mode. It's been working great for me!Timex T5G971 Unisex Sports Personal Heart Rate Monitor Watch"
5,A BETTER CHOICE,"I had used a POLAR monitor for years and was happy with everything but having to send it back to them for battery replacement. The TIMEX can be serviced by watch repair shops locally. It is simple to program, easy to start and read, and comfortable to wear. Got this one for a good price and am very happy with my choice."
1,Do Not BUy,This is the second Timex TSG971 I tried. The first one did not work at all. The second one only works periodically. I even tried electrode gel without success.
4,Works Great,I purchased 2 of these about 6 months ago and so far I've had no problems. It is very easy to set up and works great. I do wonder about the calorie count though. When I use it the calorie count shows different then the treadmill shows. I'm not sure what one is more accurate. The heart rate seems very close to my blood pressure/heart rate monitor. For the price it is well worth it.
3,"Good for the price, but Calorie count way to high!","This is a good watch for the price and the overall functionality work great. I haven't had any problems with the watch connecting, and i haven't had to wet the sensor. With that said, i am a pretty sweaty person. But my wife is not and it worked well for her as well. The only problem that I had is that the calorie count is extremely high, but i have found calculators online that use the average heart rate."
1,Broke after 6 months of light use,I do not use this HRM often but that didn't stop this one from breaking pretty quickly. I also find the instructions pretty poorly written and not very helpful.The real kicker is that Timex charges you $8 to repair their own faulty product while under warranty.
2,"Watch works fine, but monitor stopped after a few months","When I first received the product it worked right out of the box and is very user friendly. However, after about 2 or 3 months the monitor stopped working. I changed the battery out with no luck. Hopefully it is covered under some type of warranty. I am very dissatisfied with this product."
1,Poor Quality,"This monitor worked well for the first three months. It became erratic so I changed the battery, it woked perfectly for two days, then stopped woking again. Not worth the money."
2,Awesome - when it works,This had more than what I thought I was buying. I loved the features of entering your target heart rate and then it can beep if you are over or under. It tells you your average heart rate and peak heart rate. It only worked a couple of times. It wouldn't pick up the heart rate after that. I returned it.
5,Great monitor that has everything you need!,I was looking for a heart rate monitor that wasn't too cheap or too spendy that had everything I needed and this is it!! I started Insanity December 3rd and was counting my calories but it was hard to calculate how much I was burning and how much I needed to eat. This monitor works the best for me and its easy to figure out. I definitely recommend this product!
2,HRM strap stopped working,"The HRM strap worked for the first few times. After about 4-5 uses, the HR started fluctuating like crazy (60-170 bpm) and then stopped transmitting completely. I presumed that it was a bad/old battery and ordered a CR2032 (Energizer) and replaced the battery. The HRM started working again and I thought I had the issue resolved. The HRM worked for about two more workouts and now has stopped working again.The actual watch works great, but the whole purpose of the watch was for the HRM. Needless to say I am not pleased at all with the product."
4,"Keeps HR accurately, and helps in bike training","I have used this product over the last 2 months, as a training tool for mountain biking. It has been keeping my HR without any issues, allowing me to use HR zones as a motivating tool. Pretty cool watch - also water-proof. My wife also uses it while walking, to check calories burned. Good buy."
4,A Good Book,"Hot Blooded is a good book by Lisa Jackson, although the plot was a little slow in getting into the investigation. However, the book still kept my interests because I wanted to find out if the killer was someone who the main character knows or just a random person. It wasn't a disappointment. The ending was the best, up to the very last page. Also the love scenes in this book are amazing! You go Lisa!"
1,Awful,"The awful cover of this book should be an indication to you of the story quality as well. The plot of this book sounded interesting, but when I started reading, I realized quickly that it was a jumbled mess of unconnected events thrown together to try to make for a story. I got about 2/3 of the way through it before throwing it away. The book is riddled with spelling errors, which I believe is because it was self-published. No one edited this book unfortunately, or read over it to tell ms. St. Amour that ""publishing"" it was a bad idea. The other two reviews are most likely from friends of hers."
2,A bit pricy and handle is too long!,"I agree with the rest of the reviews...this is pretty expensive for a tiny little filter, and providing an additional handle/holder for it is unnecessary...In fact, I have the new BrewMaster Deluxe model and the replacement handle is too long...I only discovered this after I threw out the other one, and had to go back and dig through the garbage to retrieve it. I'm going to end up with a kitchen drawer full of them!"
4,water filter replacement pods,"I've only used the Hammilton Beach Brew Station for a couple of weeks, it does a good joob using the watere filters."
1,Hamilton Beach Water Filter,"I've taken my water filter out of my coffee maker and it tastes the same to me. Sometimes I put it in, and sometimes I leave it out. And, today, I left it out.I don't think the plastic filter holder sets low enough in the reservoir anyway. Has anyone tried cutting off the legs? There are gaps in the plastic holder that allows water to seep down into the machine, without being filtered. Personally, I don't think this filter is worth the price."
2,Short handle is too long - required cutting,"I have theHamilton Beach 48465 Brewstation Summit Ultra 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemakerand this filter set does not fit properly. The set comes with 2 handles and an extender handle, however even the shorter handle is too long - not allowing for the large coffee urn to settle properly into the base. I had to cut the smaller handle to make it work.The coffee does have a better taste when using this filter but the cost for each of these is a bit high.Know upon buying this for theHamilton Beach 48465 Brewstation Summit Ultra 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemakerthat a bit of modification is necessary.Added on 3/11/10 - I have stopped using this due to the difficult nature of fitting it in the coffee maker. I do not recommend using it with the Brewstation."
3,extremely obsolete software,"It is a good introduction. However, what makes me *MAD* is that the software accompanied can not run on Excel 97! It seems that it is developed on Windows 3.1! Is there anyone in this world still using Window 3.1?"
2,NO DUB!?!,Nothing on amazon instant video (PS3) said this was only subtitled I love the english dub to this show on the dvd release. I feel like I made a mistake purchasing season 1. 2 stars just because Kenshiro is in it.
2,Out of Place,"I find it hard to believe that Big Bird would find himself miles away from Sesame Street and that he'd forget how to get back home. In all my years of watching Sesame Street, I can't recall Big Bird ever leaving. Big Bird is a city bird. The book would have been better if it had just focused on the farmer rather than having Big Bird dumbly stumbling around looking at various animals while trying to find his way home."
4,GREAT!,"I occasionally buy these at the counter and recently am hooked. Its so flavorful and share them with your friends, you will receive complements. The candy coated with a sour white powder and activates all of your tastes buds, makes your mouth water like crazy! Then followed with a mild sweet tangy taste to to finish. They are truly one of a kind. A little on the expensive side, I must say, but Amazon has a deal here... it comes to about to a buck and a half when you buy the 16 pack. Great Deal!"
5,Best in class,Simply put this is one of the best books on prayer and especially warfare that I have read. Pastor Jack knows this subject well. It is exciting to read how God has given us all a position in Him that can affect real change using the weapons we have been given and learning to stand in faith in our Lord. I recommend this to every Christian who is serious about their prayer life and their relationship with The Savior. In fact the copy I am reviewing is one I bought to give to a friend.
1,No equal to the real deal,"Eventhough this holster does hold the phone, I've found it very difficult to get the phone in and out of the holster. The top of the clip also digs into my side. Cingular doesn't sell the ""real deal"" anymore (it was comfortable and very easy to get the phone in and out of) so I'm going to keep looking."
4,Staying power!,"I read this a while back and realized I never reviewed it. I don't always go back to fill in missing reviews, but I felt compelled to do so here because this book has stuck with me. That must say something about it.The writing wasn't the smoothest, but the romance and plot development was well done. The pacing was consistent and I couldn't put it down until I was finished. It was gritty and sexy at the same time with a decent mystery to keep you engaged.Honestly, while I forget some books as soon as I put them aside, I have often thought of this one and have continued to hope the second book in the series would become available for Kindle. I finally gave in and ordered a paperback!So- bottom line. This is worth the time since I have been looking forward to getting back into the ""Nightcreature"" series!"
3,Quite enjoyable but a few holes,"What I liked:the dialogue, the fact that the heroine wasn't a virgin and wasn't a nitwitSPOILERS!!What didn't sit right:-he fell madly in love with her nearly immediately? there was no explanation for that one.-(as said by another reviewer) what was so bad about the werewolves?-the werewolf hunter blamed it all on the nazis and his failed attempts to kill all of the experimental creatures however his organisation had plenty of evidence of werewolves all throughout history.-how many people walk 5 miles through the forest in the nude? Didn't seem all that realistic that he was nude so often.BUT overall I like this book and will read the next one."
3,Helpfull Book,"The book outlines the F.D. oral interview process, which helped me get organized for my interview. The questions and ""Suggested-Responses"" prompted me to think of my appropriate responses. The book was very helpfull."
4,Not a very good toy,"I bought this item for my 6-month baby. I was dissapointed since the Radio has very few functions and songs. I thought at first it would be a good purchase, however from now on, I'll rather see the item physically in a store and not just virtually over the net."
3,"A Curiosity, But Not Horrible.","This recording made either during or after a string of live performances in Italy was a showcase for Luciano Pavarotti. And he does a pretty good job as Manrico. He was certainly not a young man anymore, but his voice still had the same distinctive beauty and ring. But he sounds like he just barely made it through the sustained high note at the end of ""Di quella pira."" I give Pavarotti 4 out of 5 stars. I had not heard of Antonella Banaudi (the Leonora) before this recording, and I haven't heard of her since. While her voice is attractive enough it sounds as though this role is just too much for her. Not to mention she can't handle the coloratura. I give a lot of credit to Leo Nucci's Count di Luna. He deserves more credit than he usually recieves. His voice is attractive and he sings this role with passion. Shirley Verrett does a great job as Azucena."
5,"Semper fi, Miss Stillman!","Semper fi, Miss Stillman! I'm an ex-Marine and I want to thank you for filling me in on the tragic lives of some of the kids who live outside the base at Twentynine Palms. I was stationed there for awhile and to tell you the truth, I hated the desert so I didn't explore the area except for when I had to, out on the rifle range, etc. Now I'm sorry I didn't because you have given me a new appreciation for the desert. Some day, I hope I can return and see it with your eyes. At the time I was just not interested - chalk it off to age I guess! Moreover, your insight into the world of this base community - and all the people who depend on the Marine Corps for a living - is invaluable. Please keep writing. I'm recommending this to all my friends and I look forward to your next book."
2,overwritten underacheiver,"I'm a true crime fan. I've also spent time in Twenty-Nine Palms. So I thought this one would be a sure winner. Wrong! The author obviously feels she's ""too good"" to tell the story in a straightforward manner. So we get page after page of how the Mojave Desert is laced with earthquake faultlines, the high desert is where Americans come to recreate themselves and other claptrap meant to lend ""deeper meaning"" to the events. But what has greater gravity--the author's awkward literary pretensions, or the fact that two young people were horribly murdered? In a sense, the author does the two girls a disservice by placing her own ambitions over their fate. Look to Ann Rule, Jack Olsen, etc. , for good, solid writing that allows the crime to tell the tale."
3,likable,The multi tap works but seems to make the PS2 run louder at times due to the fan cooling it down.
1,"duh, Amazon's on crack...","Silly Amazon, why did you ask me to review this?? I never purchased this item, never would have any use for a bear trap! Mouse traps, mebbe, but never a bear trap - wait - I have cats for the mice..."
5,The Title Says It All....,"Ray Charles was ahead of his time in a number of ways...this is most evident in this wonderful collection of his best works...Why some may argue that his early ABC-Dunhill recordings showed his versatility....these Atlantic recordings showcase an artist who was not afraid to experiment with what he was feeling inside...Though Ray's vocals are strong and vibrant, these Atlantic recordings also showcase that Ray was first and foremost a musician...the fact that he could utilize his vocals as an instrument only strengthens his title of genius..This is a must own collection...regardless of the price!!!"
4,great helmet,I bought this helmet for my 5 yr old son and he loves it. Especially loves the fact that he could put his own stickers on it. Very comfortable!
5,"Great helmet, comfortable and easy to adjust","Can't say enough about how easy it is to adjust. Using the dial to change the size of the interior head strap made it so comfortable for my son, he never minds wearing his helmet."
5,best tube bait,have used these tubes for a couple of years and they are very durable and the price is great. the solid head on this bait really helps with durability.
2,Thumbs down for Dismas this time around...,"&quotThe Mercy Rule"". Although I am an avid fan ofLescroart novels and especially so of the Dismas Hardy character, Ifelt this book let me down somewhat. Slow courtroom drama, and a lot of surrounding ""fluff"" for a lack of a better word. Still not a bad read (since I just finished reading one of the worst books ever prior to this one), but still not the exciting page turner that I was expecting from this author. Hope the next one doesn't disappoint."
5,OPENING A LESCROAT BOOK IS LIKE MEETING OLD FRIENDS,"Lescroat has that ability to make his primary characters believeable and earthy. In the ""Dismas"" books one feels like they are returning to old friends who have encountered some problems along the way. The only problem is that Dismas always seems to get involved in MURDER! And when that happens you can rest assured that Dismas looks under every stone until he finds the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.""The Mercy Rule"" was a great 'who dunnit' with quite a few possibilities on the list of suspects but the author holds us in suspense until the enth degree - as we rule out each suspect and turn the pages faster and faster to learn the identity of the true killer.Even with murder, mystery and mayhem, Lescroat instills a sense of duty, family loyalty and love in his novels and he shows no exception with The Mercy Rule. A great read."
2,Tough going,"This is my first(and possibly last) Lescroart book and though some of the characters are potentially interesting,I found it terribly hard going and started hurrying through it just to get finished.I don't buy the romance between the cop and the suspect anyway-she'd be bounced off any police force!"
5,Ten Times Better Than Any Grisham,"This book is ten times better than any recent John Grisham book. And twenty times better than any David Baldacci. For one thing, it has a well-thought-out plot. It has some characters with some depth. The relationship between Dismas Hardy and his wife still lacks any depth, however; she ends up being mainly an irritant as opposed to a positive element in the narrative. Still, I would recommend this book to anyone as a superior effort."
3,"Interesting characters, but a bit too long","I've read all of Lescroart's books, and was glad to get my hands on another. However, I was a bit disappointed in the general lethargy of the plot, as well as the overboard dose of assisted-suicide leanings. I'm a law student, and as such I was also a bit disappointed by the lack of courtroom drama. However, all that said, the main character is incredibly interesting, as are others characters I would've liked to known better. Alas, my last novel before law school starts again..."
4,The Mercy Rule,I have just started reading this Author and am loving it. The caratures are interesting.
5,Thanks,What more can I say - both movies are exceptional. Thanks for delivering on time and once again . Who can say anything bad about Denzel - EXCEPTIONAL!!!! Both movies are jam packed with things that are needed to compose an exceptional watch! Over and Over again!!!!
4,Does the Job,"after sorting through all the available skins,cases, & covers for my 4th gen 20GB IPod I decided to go woth this one.And it does the job as expected.It is very form fitting, and offers protection for the ipod & Ipod screen.he only drawback it the screen cover is hard to clean when it gest dusty or dirty.Other than that small thing I am very pleased with this item."
2,recorded with a pocket tape recorder,"The sound quality of the first 4 songs or so is tolerable, after that the sound quality goes right down the tubes, it should be a crime for someone to release a product of this quality."
3,Asia's Last Stand,"Planet Asia's last solo album ""Last Stand"" (before signing with Interscope) is a mediocre-produced album. I love Asia's flow, but his lyrics and beats are plain. If you have heard his EP, this album is very similar, also having only 8 tracks to cop. I feel Asia is better on collaborations [20000 Leagues under the Street, Sway & Tech, Cali Agents, to name just a few] than his solo effort. I am a huge Asia fan, but not much on this album. Maybe Interscope will notice how much talent Asia has, and get him a fresh producer like Premier, Pete Rock, or Hi-Tek."
3,"Some are great, some definitely 3 star versions","The 4th is quite good.With the 5th, I think Maazel missed the mark. I don't like the wind players on that one and even the strings are too screechy.The 3rd good to very good. Timings in the 3rd: 9:17,8:11, 8:42. I don't have a problem with the clarinetist here. Oboist and clarinetist play OK together, plus flute.The 6th is better than the 5th, but I still don't like the clarinetist all that much. He/she plays these odd clipped off notes. And the tempi are quite variable within the movements. This really sticks out compared to all other recordings I have of this. The oboist is good, last movement of the 6th is quite normal.No great problems with 1st and 7th.Maazel fans: what's with the not helpful votes? You know in your hearts Maazel was never even as good as Barbirolli. The helpful vote is when it's helpful, the NOT helpful when you did not get anything out of the review. If you do not agree, that is where the COMMENT section is to be used."
2,wonderful version bad reproduction,"The 4th symphony by Maazel and the VPO has always been one of my favorites. The CD reproduction proposed here is particularely bad, overworked by computarized ""enhancements"". Th wonderful sound of the original has become thick, heavy, with no space. What a pitty. Compare with the BELART CD to undersd what I mean, which is not yet perfect, but already much better if I tack the vynil as a reference."
4,Excellent work... but far too short!,"I would give this 5 stars in a heartbeat were the album a bit longer... and normally I'm all fine and good with the artists' work even when it's short, but unfortunately the tracks on this album are so fine that you're left wanting MUCH more... especially the closing track, which doesn't even reach 3 minutes. I'd gladly pay triple for a remix version of this album that simply stretched some of the tracks out!"
3,Missing something,"While I like the soundtrack, the most interesting peice of music in the film was the gospel rendition of Ayn Kelohenu, which was left off the soundtrack. What a pity!"
3,Thrown together,"I loved the music in the film and was somewhat disappointed with the soundtrack. The best songs are thrown together at the beginning of the soundtrack and then followed by score music with two disco tunes wrapping up the cd. The score music could have been placed between songs, but perhaps that would have been too much effort for the cd-makers? The Santana song was not included. I had to remix the tunes on another recording for myself. I am glad to have the first four songs but think the soundtrack cd could have been organized more thoughtfully."
4,The DaVinci Code,"The DaVinci Code was genius. You can tell that it took a lot of thought and research to write it. The book is full of fictional characters intertwined in a real life setting, describing actual places in detail. I know the book was controversial, but if you think about the geniusness that went into the book, you can just enjoy it and it doesn't matter whether you believe in its content or not. It _is_ a fictional book. I think The DaVinci code proves the brilliance of Dan Brown."
4,great Advent Bible study,"This study really helps prepare you for the upcoming Advent season. It ties together prophecy and the intricacy of all the details that occurred leading up to Jesus' birth. It takes a familiar story that most of us can quote from watching Charlie Brown, and it brings out things you have never considered or noticed before. The most intensive study happens before Advent, before the rush of December begins. Then in December, you have daily devotionals that remind you of what you have studied. A fantastic study that I highly recommend. My Bible study class met and discussed it each week of November."
3,It's okay....,"The story was done well, photography good, was just a little slow....interesting and informative but not exciting. Not one of those stories you would watch over and over again."
3,"A little slow moving, with an anti-European bias","Pluses: The computer generated imagery is interesting, and cinematography is excellent.Minuses: Rather slow moving, and as other reviewers have said, geared to a jr high level. And, I'm afraid, rather patently anti-European. Columbus' crew are ""desperados"". And we're told about how smallpox is passed to the Indians via infected objects, while a European man gives a little Indian girl... a crucifix. (Yep, those devious Europeans wiped out the gentle natives with smallpox-infested crucifixes.) Of course, this sort of spin is de rigueur for Columbian Exchange history these days, but one could at least do it a little more subtly."
3,"America is a Continent, Not a Country.","While I agree with the many reviews posted, the documentary is most disappointing in its concentration on the part of North America that would become the United States. I expected more from National Geographic. The Inca, Maya and Aztec were barely mentioned in comparison to the Mound civilizations where perhaps thousands of people lived before its collapse. Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital, enjoyed high civilization with a population close to 200,000 when Cortes entered the city in 1519, larger than any city in Europe."
1,No Secrets,"If all you are looking for is a very high-level view of Windows 2000 then this book may be OK. But if you want a detailed look at the system, there are much better books available at comparable prices.The title is a misnomer -- there are no secrets to be found here!"
2,More a How To Book,"This is a Windows 2000 ""How To"" book. If you are looking for a book about Windows 2000 ""Secrets"" then don't waste your money. This book does a mediocre job of walking you through using Windows 2000, and the ""Secrets"" are few and far between... and some are not even secrets at all.If you are looking for a how to book, buy one of Microsoft's books, they're much better at this.Very disappointed. Kind of feel like I got hit with a bait and switch."
1,Beware,"There are two versions of this chair. This mesh version is a knock off from the real one. I once owned the real one with a cloth cover and it was great. This product offered, is the same price with an almost dollar store quality. Cheap frame... after only about ten uses the slide adjustment loosened so it can only be used in two positions, up or down. The mesh is weak... if you weigh over about 98 pounds be prepared for your butt to sink into a hole that grows with continued use. It is auckward in not folding completely. I had saved the chair as a present for myself to use on vacation. I opened it a week after the return policy date. I contacted the company as soon as I realized this was not the item I had expected. With four attempts the company was not interested in my being satisfied by taking it back or giving any kind of exchange or refund... even in having the box and all the packaging."
4,CONFUSING!!!,"Good continuation of the Dragon Prince Trilogy. However there are too many characters with similar sounding names, therefore it is difficult to figure out who's child is who's; and which characters are brothers and sisters. However, this was an enjoyable read, and I would recommend it to anyone, as long as you have read the books in the previous series, you shouldn't get too confused."
1,"Dry, must read previous series first?","This books discription on the back cover and the artwork on the cover made me expect a 5 star book. Yet after a very exhausting effort of reading this book, that is more than just cunfusion. Well it is one of the worst books I have ever read, out of thousands of books I have previously read. I have read many of the other reviews listed here. Most of these reviews have one thing in common, one must read the previous Dragon Prince books first. STRONGHOLD IS CONFUSION BECAUSE IT SHOULD NOT BE BOOK ONE, BUT THE BOOK NUMBER AFTER THE LAST DRAGON PRINCE BOOKS. Who ever heard of taking a book in the middle of a series and calling it book one. This author could learn a lot from Robert Jordan!"
1,Hard to clean,"I picked this up recently and tried several varieties of loose tea in it. The bottom line is that tea does get stuck in the one that I own. I have tried a couple of methods to get the tea out to no avail. It might be hard to see from the picture, but the ""holes"" for the water are actually slits in the bottom around the bottom rim of the infuser. The slits are actually sickle shaped and the tea gets caught in the narrow areas. I imaging that differences in the cuts would either make or break this product. In my case they make me want to break it."
3,Good for daughters who are younger siblings,"This delightful story is a complete ego trip for little girls who find themselves the youngest in a family of several siblings. It features many adventures, adoring older children, adoring parents, and a little girl who is the apple of everyone's eye. It also -- a bit subtly -- features beloved family friends who are a same-sex couple. This goes over the heads of the little ones."
1,Dangerous!,"I used to work for the company which created this software. It locks the user's computer into a database that no longer exists. It's basically ""unhappy customer in a box"", waiting to be opened. If you're looking for a reason to reinstall your operating system, this would do it for you. The company is no longer in business, so please take this hint.Amazon forced me to give it one star. It's negative fifteen stars, folks."
5,"Incredible; ""Changed my Life""","I am fortunate to live in Santa Fe where I have been in one of Gary and Jim's Men's groups. I have been in this group for close to four years, but until I read this book many of their insights I had heard over and over had never really sunk in.""Gay Warrior"" has become a roadmap on my personal journey on what it means to be a powerful gay man; moving closer and closer to living up to my full potential and being free to live a vibrant and joyous life.I have told many friends across the country about ""Gay Warrior"" and they all have thanked me profusely and had their own version of how this book is changing their lives.In fact, one friend in Canada gave the book to his gay therapist who uses it as a reference text in working with not only gay men but all of his male clients.I am forever in gratitude to these two warriors for writing this book."
3,kinda boring but OK i guess,to say the truth the book was a little boring. i bought it for my summer reading project in high school and ugh it seruiosly bored me. and books dont bore me to often.
5,Haunted by the living.,"All of Sarah Dessen's books have a haunting quality; the people she writes about are living half-lives because of some incident. And, all of the books are unique. Just Listen has been compared to Speak, but I found it quite different-better. It's a good, fast read. But, I'd never label it light reading."
5,best book ever!,i have to say that this book is probaly one of the best books ive ever read. it is beautyfully written and it can be related to. kudos to sarah dessen foe writing such a good book!
3,"Good, But Annoying...","I thought this was going to be a love story and have a traumatic event in it like the summary suggests. Unfortunately, that's not what this is. Owen and Annabel's relationship is covered in the form of one kiss and we are supposed to guess that the future holds a relationship for the two of them. That could have gone into more depth. But, if your looking for a romance this is not one. Owen the boy of the book, isn't exactly what I excpected either. He's sort of annoying. It seems like what he and Annabel have together is strictly limited to music. That's just about the ONLY thing they talk about. I'm not even kidding either. But the other parts of the book are great. I would have liked more closure with her and Sophie but the ending was still okay. Overall if you want to read another version of speak but with good side stories, then read this."
1,Let Old Boys Sleep,"I have read all of Mr. McCarry's other books with Paul Christopher as the central character, and they are all top drawer. This work, unfortunately, has little plot - and what there is of it is uninteresting - little about Christopher, and at the end, the reader does not really care. His mother is the most interesting though confused person in the book, and at the end, we learn little about her motives. All in all, this book does not measure up, sorry to say."
5,Great deal!,We received two great movies at an incredibly low price. Both movies were in good condition and will be enjoyed.
2,The adapter was not what you think it was,the company shipped the wrong product so terminated my payment. In all and got the adapter free still rather a lil useless
1,WORSE EVER!!,"I would never buy anything from this seller. Item I received is not what was advertized and shown here. I email him for exponation but he likes to lecture that is what I ordered. I returned the same way he sent to me to get refund, he said he never received it and ignores me now. Come on... He took my money and I got nothing."
2,Great Seller,"I ordered this thinking it would be a good travel item but after I took it out of the packaging and opened it, one part fell off and would not stay in place after...the plastic housing is rather fragile. As soon as the seller saw my review, they sent a replacement which worked perfectly. I'm a very happy customer and willing to do business with this seller again!"
2,Stinks...,I bought this because i had extra $$ to spend... the movie was good but this soundtrack sucks... 'all my fault' by riverfenix is good and so is the blink song... the rest are crappy...
1,Broke Again,"Do not waste your time and money.My unit will not even turn on.It is 14 months old and has been nothing but trouble,"
3,Suma correccion....,"...Pero nada mas. Muy bien cantada, con un reparto donde destacan los seguros agudos de la Reina de la Noche de SUMI JO. UWE HEILMANN hace un Tamino notable, aunque no nos hara olvidar a Fritz Wunderlich, mientras que MICHAEL KRAUS es un mas que correcto Papageno, que explota su vena comica, pero vocalmente no es Fischer Dieskau, claro esta... KURT MOLL es un Sarastro realmente autoritario, y RUTH ZIESAK una dulce Pamina. Los secundarios cumplen bien en sus respectivos roles. Los efectos sonoros (truenos, pajaros etc) se hacen por momentos excesivos, que es otra de las cosas que perjudica a esta version, que dirige un inspirado GEORG SOLTI."
4,A really great recording...,"I am preparing the role of Pamina and got my hands on pretty much every recording I could find. This isn't my favorite, but it's very close.When listening to the plethora of recordings, you find out very quickly that tempos in this opera are all over the place. However, this is the one recording where I feel the tempos are spot on (which doesn't surprise me with Solti directing traffic). Some may say the directing isn't ""fresh"", but I personally don't like too many surprises in terms of interpretation.Solti, the orchestra and the singers are all in great form, however I like my Queens a little less screechy. Sumi Jo just doesn't scare the bejeezus out of me like June Anderson does. And although Ziesak is a wonderful Pamina, there are a couple of times she pushes her voice slightly beyond beautiful. (But in my opinion, everyone plays second ""flute"" to Barbara Bonney's Pamina.)Overall, a very good recording with fresh singers and a great conductor."
1,worse than useless,"This book is meant to teach you how to use IIS 5. It says on the back ""Everything you need to know to maximise IIS 5.0.."". This is completely untrue. This book teaches you nothing about the latest features of IIS, for example, it have virtually nothing on ASP. It is not comprehensive enough to be a reference manual, nor is it written in a format that would make it easy to read from start to finish like a study guide. It is not one of those books where you can read a single chapter and get an understanding of that subject. It is like written like a Microsoft study guide (contradiction in terms) but without any detail, so I can't really see who would benefit from this book at all. I would say wholly useless and award it 0 stars if that was possible."
4,Hunter's Moon,"Impelled by a tragic past, Leigh Tyler has become one of the finest Juger - Suchers on the planet, and due to this capability, when Jessie (Blue Moon) needs training, Edward summons Leigh to be her guide. The teacher may have a bit to learn from her student though. After all, Jessie and her lover, Will, just killed the wolf god. Now these three, and the enigmatic Damien must join together to stop the Wendigo, the ultimate lycanthrope. Making it all the more dangerous is this villain's unholy desire for Leigh herself, a passion that will force her to go to confront the deepest darkness; either to be consumed or triumph.**** This book and its predecessor have all the hallmarks of an upcoming classic series; focus is sharpley maintained, the heroes are flawed and compelling, the tension level taut, yet lightened with wit. Be sure and add both Hunter's Moon and Blue Moon to your keeper shelf- and make room for Dark Moon, the third book coming soon. ****"
4,Satisfies all those howling cravings,"This is a good, solid book. Fulfills my need for a bit of mystery and violence, friendship and passion.Characters from the first book, Blue Moon, return to support the story which allows you to keep in touch with old favorites. The new couple are just as complex as far as character development and their passion simmers throughout. The four of them make an oddly charming dynamic of gritty women and gorgeous men.As far as paranormal romance series go, this one is turning out to be darker, especially considering the focus has been on the women. Lara Adrian's Midnight Breed series is pretty dark, but the men are the central characters. This series isn't as sexually charged, though the passion and romance is still engaging.Enjoy!"
5,From One Extreme to Another,"This is a wonderful compilation of Pumpkins material: it's an absolute must for the die-hard fan. It includes the Pumpkins' singles from Mellon Collie... with numerous b-sides such as Rotten Apples (a lovely mellow tune) to a cover song of My Blue Heaven (written in the 20's). It's creative and bounces from one extreme to another. Tonight, Tonight has very light and mellow songs on it,Thirty-Three which is a bit heavier, 1979 is heavier still, Bullet...is a slap in the face with its techno, 80's cover songs and finally the Zero single which is border-line Metal. I encourage anyone who is even the slightest bit interested in the Pumpkins to buy this box set-you won't be sorry!"
2,ok........,"Dont buy this unless you are a really big fan of the band and has lots of money. Instead of releasing a 5 disc box-set they could have released a double album, and still fitted all the songs minus the ones that are already on Mellon Collie.There are some good songs here, mostly on the ""Zero"" disc, but overall the songs are just mediocre, just like b-sides most often are. I see that this box-set recieves a lot of 5 star reviews, and it feels like its just a hype. Is it the songs they like so much, or the package, or do they just feel they have to give this a 5 star review because they spent so much money on it (combined with their unconditional love for the band).I was myself a big fan of the band at the time when I bough this and I still didnt like it. So dont expect to like it just because you liked ""Mellon Collie"", ""Gish"" or ""Pisces Iscariot"". There just arent any great musical moments or surprises on this box-set. In my opinion it wasnt worth the money."
1,Worst pencil sharpener I have ever used!!!!!!!!!!,"Giving this pencil sharpener a one-out-of-five-star rating is very generous. It is the worst pencil sharpener I have ever used! If you have 10-15 MINUTES to waste, you can partially sharpen a new pencil with this pencil sharpener. It takes at least that long. On previously sharpened pencils, I can never get a good point with it. I regret buying it and should have returned it to the store from which I bought it (not Amazon). I want to replace it with a pencil sharpener that works from amazon.com."
1,Unacceptable!,"This poor excuse for a sharpener doesn't center pencils well at all, so wood frequently intrudes upon the point. The motor is exceptionally noisy and quite weak -- it stalls easily. The single cutter is small and the waste recepticle requires frequent emptying or else it spills shavings. I'll never buy another X-acto sharpener."
2,The Loons are interesting,"Lily, who sings and plays piano in a club at night and teaches music in school by day, lives in Boston. She has a friend who is a cardinal in the church. A reporter tells the world, Lily is having an affair with the cardinal, which is untrue, causes her to lose her jobs and move back home to the lake. She proceeds to correct the slander by making friends with John, another reporter that lives on the lake. Very easy reading, and a little Ho Hum."
2,C by Example,"If you are a novice this will be a good book for you. This book is steered toward beginner programmers and should not be purchased by anyone that has an understanding of C. I bought this book because I was very happy with the ""Perl by Example"" I recently purchased. I was very disapointed. I have tryed to use this book over the past 6 months. Whenever I tried to look something up they don't cover it.So if you want to learn how to program in C its great. If you are like me and enjoy seeing an example of a function, look elsewhere. This will NOT help you.Brian (still searching for a good C reference book)"
4,"Outdated, full of typos, but good for ""intro to C"" students","Did you ever want a sourcebook with very basic code that clearly illustrate points in a non-technical manner (without having to fumble through several different websites or having to write it yourself)? This is it.Other reviewers have noted the typos and outdated nature of the text. They're right on both counts, as this is not a C++ text and it does have a number of typos. Then again, OOP isn't generally dealt with in intro courses. The typos, well, there goes a star.A good sourcebook for intro level examples along withHow Not to Program in C++: 111 Broken Programs and 3 Working Ones, or Why Does 2+2=5986which is, as far as I know, the only book on debugging written at a very basic, introductory level. I've heardC++ Gotchas: Avoiding Common Problems in Coding and Designis good, too but it seems slighly higher level and geared towards people with some programming background."
1,JUNK,"Not enough clear examples. Too chatty for me. Just tell me how to program. Would much prefer a cookbook-style book. Had I known it was this bad and wasn't required for class, I *never* would have bought it! He does things like not clearly indentifying code that doesn't work. The book is rife with typos and plain old inaccuracies. How anyone is supposed to learn from that, I don't know. I was really disappointed because the Que series is generally very good. This was a notable exception."
5,Best Mozart Requiem recording available,"What an event this is. Solti is in top form here conducting the Vienna Philharmonic in a very powerful and fiery performance of this most famous of requiems. While some conductors take the Kyrie pretty slow, Solti kicks it in high gear and keeps it moving. The soloists are all magnificent especially Cole and Pape. The Dies Irae and the Confutatis are more powerful here than I have ever heard them before. The chorus is very fine and sings with power and a lovely round sound. The Lacrymosa and Domine Jesu are incredibly beautiful. This is probably the 2nd best Mass recording ever, right behind Barenboim's Verdi Requiem recording. Get them both and be prepared to be moved in a way you never thought possible."
1,Vocab Workshop: Level E,"I am thoroughly irritated about this book, in that, it came from an outside seller, and never was it mentioned that the entire workbook had already been written in. It was billed as used in very good condition. It is totally unusable, and, if I had the time I would have contacted the seller and asked for a refund, etc."
1,Boring,This book is way to boring for the average child. Even though it may be a good source of new vocab it is the most boring and waste of time thing to do.
4,Very good book.,I am almost half way through the book and it is very good with a lot of unknown information about World War II>
1,Don't buy it,"It fits in my hand ok and would probably help wrist pain as advertised, it could be a little bigger even. Too bad it's not a corded mouse - I might actually use it if it were.The reception is so bad that it will only work when the receiver so close that I bump into it with normal mouse movements. I tried repositioning the receiver, raising it off the desk, ... one suggestion is to turn it over (like I want that on my desk!) and that even seemed to work a little better.I gave it a one star rating. If it even worked a little, I'd give it 2 because it's comfortable. Since it's totally useless, it gets 1 star only because there is no 0."
3,not for small hands,"I have a lot of pain in my hands/wrists that is especially exacerbated by computer use. This mouse does help somewhat, but it's not built for small hands (female size X-Small/Small hands). After using it for a few days I felt a strain in my index finger because I constantly had to reach over the big mouse to click. I wish the mouse was a little smaller all around / less bulky.But, the overall positioning of the hand on this mouse helps A LOT with wrist pain. You can feel it right away. If you have Medium-Large hands you will probably love it.The mouse software installation took maybe 2 minutes, and was very easy."
4,"After a short adjustment period, excellent!","I'm on a PC several hours a day and have been for more than 20 years. While carpal-tunnel had not become an issue it was a concern so I decided to try a mouse with an alternative hand position.My wife bought another brand ""potato"" mouse a while back that I personally found awkward. CT had become a serious issue for her and she found the grip style mouse alleviated her discomfort.I gave the MS Natural 6000 a test run run and after about a day or so, found it comfortable and easy to use. A ""normal"" mouse now takes a few moments of adjustment.Try it!"
3,Microsoft Natural Wireless Laser Mouse 6000,"I purchased the mouse because I thought it would reduce the strain (carpal tunnel?)on my wrist. It did not, however help me with that problem. I returned the unit and have been told that a credit is in the process. The mouse worked well, but did not do what I bought it for."
5,Excellent product,This mouse is one of the best mice I have ever used! It has a wonderful easy-of-use and fits perfectly for the countless hours that I spend on the computer. Love it!
2,Good Idea but USB Dongle is HUGE.,I bought this thinking it would be a more ergonomic mouse to use with my laptop and carry around (I didn't care about the large size). I didn't even use it because it comes with a huge corded USB dongle for communication - not a tiny one like most wireless mice these days. This is intended for a permanent desktop install where people don't mind an extra mouse-size corded dongle sitting on the desktop.
1,Not robust,After six months the side panel covering blistered and began to come off. Not a direct show stopper but enough to make the mouse uncomfortable to use and so had to buy another (choose a Logitech model). Worked well while it lasted but this critical failure made it a very bad buy.
4,"Comfortable, but the rubber grip sucks","I've gone through 2 of these mice in the last year, and while the overall design is great, the rubber grip material is garbage.On the plus side:* The batteries last about 6 months with heavy 9-5 use* The ergonomic design is easy to get used to.* The response is very smooth on just about any surface.On the down side:* The rubber grip material quickly wears out and leaves a sticky/scummy residue on your fingers no matter how often you clean it.* The default mappings for the two right index buttons (Back and Zoom) are problematic if you do a lot of work in web-based applications."
2,CAD users beware,"If you use the middle mouse button a lot you will find this mouse discouraging. The middle mouse button is significantly harder to push and spin than my Logitech. If this is not an issue for you then this mouse is nice.Cheers,Vin"
3,"ergonomically works well, doesn't wear well","positives:For someone with fairly large hands, fits hand fine, less wrist strain than other mice I've used due to not having to twist arm inward as most mice require.I have three of these, one is actually the 7000 that came with the wireless desktop, physically the same mouse, so I love the ergonomics.but...On the two older mice, (I've had one for about a year, and another for 1 1/2 years) the rubbery plastic on thumb rest wears and breaks down, gets nasty, material breaks down, bubbles up, gets greasy oozey and just looks awful, starts to feel like thumb is resting in slime.the darker, harder, rubbery plastic that wraps around the sides is also starting to break down, it is not as nasty as the thumb rest, but it is showing it's age before its time.for this kind of money, materials should last longer, wear better than this."
4,"Good, basic ergonomic mouse","I don't have carpal tunnel syndrome yet, and I am doing my best to stave it off. At the office, I use the best ergonomic mouse ever made, the ""Zero Tension Mouse"" (available atUltraLite Zero Tension Mouse Eases Carpal Tunnel - Size LARGE, but cheaper on other websites). If you have, or are seriously concerned about, carpal tunnel syndrome, this is the mouse for you.So why, you ask, am I reviewing the Microsoft 69K-00001 Natural Wireless Laser Mouse, and giving it four stars? Because you can't beat the price, it's wireless, and it is small enough to carry around and use with my laptop. Yes, it's bigger than a wrist-wrecker standard mouse, but it's still a lot smaller than a true ergo-mouse.If you are in a lot of pain, get the Zero Tension Mouse and you'll be amazed. If you want something more like a regular mouse, the Microsoft 69k-00001 is a rockin' deal.NOTE: It was selling for about $20 when I wrote this. If the price is up around $60, spend more to get the ZTM."
2,Left-click failing,"This was a great mouse when it worked, but now after a couple of years the left click is starting to fail. Have to really press hard or hold it for too long. That's pretty disappointing for a mouse this expensive."
3,Not for a laptop!,I bought this mouse to replace a Logitech mouse I use with my laptop. Big mistake! The mouse works really well but!! it has this transmitter/receiver (it is almost as large as the mouse) on the end of a cord. Portabilty zero. I have bought a new Logitech mouse for use with the laptop (Small USB transmitter/receiver). The microsoft mouse will be used on my desktop. Don't buy this if you want portability!!
1,Sent it back,I was under the impression this had a small USB input. It has a large sized mouse reciever that is obstrusive. I have small hands and found the size of this very hard to use. It was not comfortable at all.
2,Not what I expected,"I love ergonomic keyboards and I'm using the natural keyboard for years. I thought I'd buy an ergonomic mouse for completeness.After months of use I feel very disappointed with this mouse. Why? Because,1.) It is too heavy! If you lift it up it's like a stone. This means that it requires significantly more effort to move the mouse and this adds up during the day.2.) I can't use it without a mouse pad with a wrist rest because all the weight of my hand falls on the left edge of my wrist which is the only part touching the desk surface. This adds a lot of pressure during the day and at the end you give up! You have to use a mouse pad with a wrist rest.I'm planning to stop using this mouse and get another one with simpler design."
3,"good, but...","Plain and simple, a solid set, but I personally feel that Thibaudet is no master interpreter of Ravel. He seems a bit ""willful"" at times, seeming to go for something different rather than appropriate. His staccato in the first bars of the Pavane is shocking to my ears, and makes this stately piece sound rather clumsy and ambling. The same thing happens in the minuet of the Sonatina and also in Le Tombeau's minuet. Other parts are solid and extremely well-played, but I hate his habit of rushing the time on fast phrases and then slowing down again, as if he is impatient. My pick for the best Ravel set would have to be the underrated Anne Queffelec, available on Virgin Classics for a lesser price."
2,Junior Sizing-Not Women's-about 4 sizes off-fabric flimsy,"Junior Sizing-Not Women's-about 4 sizes off-fabric flimsy. Style and color were nice, but since it isn't even close to a Women's size, can't bother with it anyway. Purchased two for friends and they were disgusted about the sizing."
1,Low quality,"My wife and I looked through all the possibilities for find a dress for the end of the summer and we liked this one. We ordered it and it fit perfectly, however after the first wash the seams at the bust line came apart while we were washing it (hand wash only, according to the tag). But the bits of stress that swooshing it around in the sink gave it were too much."
3,it cute,"this company if you look on there website, only makes clothes for Juniors, so yes you have to buy 2sizes up if you are a woman. This dress however is cute, but it was not for me, i did return it, I need something for a wedding and this just screamed, Rainbow shop, or walmart. But it is a cute dress to have say on a date, or going out with girls wit some cute sandals. Side note, it does show any extra rolls you maybe carrying. lol"
2,too clingy,"i love this dress, however, it was entirely too clingy. the sizing is not accurate. i have recently lost quite a bit of weight and felt like such a lard ass because i had to have a larger size shipped, which was too big in the bust and still clingy in the mid section. the material is very thin and not very well sewn. it's coming apart at the bottom of the bust. i wore this dress in a wedding and received many compliments, but i didn't feel as though i looked all that great in it."
1,"So far, only one customer review, so I am reluctant to buy","The price and speed of this card are appealing, but I am reluctant to take a chance and buy based on only one customer review, since some cards do have problems."
5,"Nice variety of tracks, very good musicianship","March 19, 1999 - I like it! Nice variety of tracks, very good musicianship. Our station is a non-commercial station run by the Univ. of Notre Dame."
4,Bright and Lilting,"I would give the CD a 4, a wonderful job...The music and accompaniment are bright, lilting and a lovely representation of O'Carolan's tunes. Yes to positive feedback from listeners. Leslie Hildreth, The Mist Covered Mountain KLCC-FM, Eugene, Oregon"
3,"OK, though not great.","Solti/CSO recordings are usually pretty great, but this one is a little disappointing. Not only does the orchestra sound a little ragged at times, but Solti's tempo choices also could have been better. The finale, for example, is taken at such a break-neck speed that it flies by without a lot of the subleties noticed. The recorded sound itself is nothing special, either. I think the newer (and live) Barenboim/Chicago recording is better: richer recorded sound, fantastic playing, and smarter phrasing/tempo decisions."
1,To be returned,"I recently got this product, and it will soon be returned. It smashed all of my hats (and thats with the door kept opened). I am a guy who hates dented and smashed hats. If you are too, do not buy this product. It will not keep their shape in any way. You would be better off getting a cardboard box in which to set your hats in, and carefully stacking them on top of each other, and then placing that box in a closet somewhere. If all you want is storage, great. If you want something that will help to protect the shape of your hats and provide storage, then this is not the product for you. In fairness to the manufacturer, my hats looked exactly like the hats in the photo - smashed. Obviously, I should have looked closer at the photos provided. Lesson learned, and this junk will soon be making its way back."
5,Provides safe place to store collection of hats,This cap rack works just as promised. It provides great storage for my collection of caps. Sure beats just stacking them in the closet!
5,No Doubt Comes Back With a Better CD,The first song I heard of this CD was Ex-girlfriend which is a very good song. When I bought the CD then main reason I bought it was because of the of the song. But after I listened to it a lot I found that the CD has many other good songs other than their single. I would highly recomend this Return of Saturn
1,No matter how hard I try...,"No matter how hard I try, I can't seem to enjoy ""Return of Saturn"". This cd just isn't in the same class as ""Tragic Kingdom"", which still remains one of my favourite cd's. RoS just seems to drone on, and every second track seems to be a slow, serious ballad. I initially thought (hoped) it'd grow on me, but now I've just resorted to skipping the depressing tracks (strangely most of the odd-numbered ones) so that I can play a sequence of music that half-resembles the same up-beat, fun vibe of TK.I guess it was inevitable that No Doubt's music style would change so many years after TK was written, but by this much? ""Return of Saturn""s sombre music is, for me at least, a major let-down. Be warned... or you may just end up as disappointed as I am."
4,More like 4.5,"This CD is great. The best tracks are ""Ex-girlfriend,"" ""Simple Kind of Life,"" and ""bathwater"" which I think is the best song on this CD. Even though it is a little differnt from Tragic it is still a must buy for any No Doubt fan."
5,I never get tired of listening to it,"Like I said, I never get tired of listening to it. I listen to at least 2 of the songs usually every other day if not every day. The same goes for Tragic Kingdom. On Return Of Saturn, there is only one song I don't like, which is ""Staring Problem"". Although I think even that song may be growing on me. I love the rest of the songs, but I tend to listen to ""Bathwater"", ""Suspension Without Suspense"", ""Too Late"", ""New"", and ""Dark Blue"". I'm actually listening to ""Artificial Sweetener"" as I'm typing this. Although I love Tragic Kingdom, I think Return Of Saturn is even better. You HAVE to buy this CD. You'll wonder how you survived without it lol."
4,Absolutely Amazing,"This album was long awaited by many people. And I must say, the wait was worth it. The lyrics have improved over the original two (Yup, two.) albums, and the sound has gained that lived-in edge to it. There is disappointment to the redction of the horn section from me, but I will say that Gwen can write songs as well as belt out the awesome tunes she has been doing for years."
4,An interesting balance between new wave/ska/and alternative,"Return to Saturn is a great achievement by No Doubt. Although at first I was dissapointed to hear less up beat Tragic Kingdomesque tracks, I soon began to enjoy the subtle differences on this CD. No Doubt has definately matured in their music over the past few years, and have maintained the ability to produce excellent music. Some of the best tracks on this CD are Bathwater, Home Now, and Simple Kind of Life."
5,the best new wave album ever made,"after listening to this album multiple times every day for about 6 months straight, i think i qualify as an expert, and in my expert opinion, this album ROCKS. it had the power to turn me, who previously just thought No Doubt was sort of ""ok"" into a die-hard fan. building on the foundation of new wave ska/punk that shone on Tragic Kingdom, on this album No Doubt takes the next step by incorporating more complex melodies and instrumentation into each well-crafted song. in Return of Saturn, we get to hear a No Doubt that is more mature, both lyrically and musically. they have managed to ""cross over"" more or less into mainstream pop without losing a sense of who they are or where they are going. kudos to Gwen and the rest of the band for this masterpiece. the only downside is i'm wondering how they're possibly going to improve on this."
4,cool album .. but dont expect another Tragic Kingdom,"great i liked all of the tracks if you loiked Tragic Kingdom then you'll like this one too its has a lot of great tracks ,but dont expect another Tragic Kingdom"
3,Gwens growing up...,"Whats all this business about getting married and having kids and getting divorced? With that aside, I think this album is pretty good, and the artwork is great. Am I the only one who thinks there are a couple of songs reminiscent of the Lunachicks?"
1,not good,there debut cd is soooooooo much better than this cd. tragic kindom is a flop. don't get this cd.
3,A bit dull. Punk rock - best left in the 80s.,"Sadly, tracks smacks of late 1980s punk rock which had some great grooves but this CD feels out of date (just listen to ""Staring Problem""!). RoS does not compare with Tragic Kingdom (which remains my favourite band CD); the CD lacks continuity and the songs are a bit bland. ""Comforting Lie"" is my favourite tune. Overall, little replay value."
4,A good follow... but just that!,"No Doubt had a lot to prove after the smashing success of their previous record, which propelled them from being a successful regional band to a world topping act. So does ""Return to Saturn"" do the trick?Hmmm... ok just about! Nothing fantastic here, but a solid offering all the same with some great moments. ""New"", ""Ex-Girlfriend"" and ""Bathwater"" are the standout tracks. The rest are all just so-so, including ""Too Late"", a cheesy attempt to replicate the success of ""Don't Speak"".Of course it must be said that Gwen sounds excellent and does a great job, but ""Return..."" is only an above average effort from the band."
4,not as good as Tragic Kingdom,"Well I've been waiting for this CD to come out for a while now, and it's not as good as i anticipated. There are some good songs like Bathwater, Ex-Girlfriend, and New (from the movie GO) and other upbeat songs. There are some songs that are slow and drag on, but I still recommend getting it though."
4,Style Switching,"Really No Doubt has always had the 'ska' sound from the roots of their first 2 albums. But on Return of Saturn, Stefani and crew have come back (excluding Gwen's brother who quit the band a while back.) to present quite an album. While Return of Saturn may not be what the majority of people were expecting, it turned out more of a good surprise.Hardcore fans of the band should love this album, that is if you are hardcore. Some people can say one person is hardcore for a band - but when a band switches their tempo a little bit. Some of the 'hard core' fans maybe not be so driven as one would think.Overall, the album rocks! The sounds range from a very soft almost melancholy feeling to a fast tempo."
2,SO SAD YOU'RE HAPPY NOW,"Some bands seem to thrive and create their best music out of turbulent romance and internal intrigue. Cases in point; Fleetwood Mac created Rumors, Oasis created Whats the Story..., No Doubt created Tragic Kingdom. With the Return of Saturn, Gwen Stefani is waxing poetic (and not very well) on marriage, motherhood and the joys of love. Given the sassy, take that attitude of Tragic Kingdom, Return of Saturn sounds warmed over, listless and uninspired. 5 years in the making, it seems like too little too late. From a personal standpoint I'm glad and hope Gwen and Gavin are very happy; from a musical one, I can't wait until that relationship burns in flames...there's the next great No Doubt Album."
4,There's NO DOUBT it's a hit!,"While it didn't grab my attention as fast as their last album, RETURN OF SATURN is definitely the return of a great band! Two outstanding tracks-""Ex Girlfriend"" and Bathwater"" really make this a good album choice for your collection. The band really shines throughout and prove that they have staying power. Of course the added bonus of Gwen's beauty and voice gives them an edge among female fronted bands."
2,Doesnt last long,Ive gone through 4 of these in the last 2 years with the first one lasting a good year. The problem Ive been running into is that the tips tend to fall out. On my first one this didnt start happening until after I had it for a while. With the last 2 it was almost from day one so I dont know if they changed how they are made or I just got unlucky. It really ruins your day when the bit stays in the screw and then falls and rolls under what you are working on.When the tips arent falling out this is a really handy tool to have. I never really found a use for the torx or square bits but it was nice not have to carry around different sized screwdrivers everywhere you go.I used this tool daily but sadly I had to move on to another multitool because the lose bits are a real pain.
3,Good solid mousse,"I am a pro hair stylist who has been working in high end hair salon in Manhattan for over 27 years. I honestly do not believe in name brand and quite frankly, a lot of them are just plain garbages.Got2B mousse is a decent solid mousse which give you reliable lift for volume. Price is great and it does not make hair dirty nor it is too sticky. My only complain is it could turn watery a bit too soon when there are only 30% below left in the bottle. I would have give it a 4 stars otherwise.It is sad to see a decent product discontinued."
3,Could Be Better,"Got 2B 2 Sexy Mousse (Voluptuous) is a fairly good product. I don't think I will buy it again though. As for volume, I would rate it a 2 on a scale of 1-5, 1 being no volume at all and 5 being the best volume product I've ever used. As for hold, 2 again."
5,Schecter Stiletto Custom 4 Bass,"I'm a pretty new bassist (drums and keys, primarily), and had been borrowing a bass from a friend who no longer plays. It's taken me a while to decide what make/model instrument to buy for myself. I held this baby in the store and knew I'd found it! The balance, thin neck, weight, and easy playability work perfectly for my smaller build and playing style. I think it sounds amazing - much better than my borrowed instrument! This is also my first experience with active EQ, which sounds great.As of now, I'm running this through a Roland KC-550 keyboard combo amp (180W, 15"" w/ horn). It actually sounds fuller and warmer than most low end bass amps I've tried out! I just don't have any drive options. So now I have a great instrument that will be with me for many years to come. Time to start saving for a nice amp stack!! I'm aiming for an Ampeg SVT-3PRO head and SVT-410HLF 4x10 cab."
5,virtuoso,"I loved the Red Violin; the film and the score. Joshua Bell played the solo pieces on the score. Truly extraordinary. And that is all I knew of Joshua Bell.Fast Forward.I had heard the Massenet piece on ARTS (classical MTV). Didn't know the title, but did catch the composer's name. Went online, searched the composer, then started streaming available pieces until I heard the one that I wanted. As luck would have it, this CD had the piece I wanted. I ordered it, and was stunned by the tour de force playing by Joshua Bell. There is nothing, NOTHING, in the liner notes that tells me anything about Joshua Bell. But now I know why he was chosen to play on The Red Violin. This guy plays one mean violin.The pieces on this CD (with the possible exception of the Massenet piece) are all virtuoso pieces, requiring, in my estimation, complete mastery of the violin while willing to take it right to edge.What a CD!!"
2,Low quality,"After only having the cable for a week under very light usage, the cable stopped working intermittently. It makes crackling noises when the cable is moved. I am not talking about whipping or quick movement, just gentle movement of the cable causes crackling and loss of signal. I was about to scrap the cable altogether but I decided to resolder the connector to see if that would help. I cut off about half a foot of the cable and resoldered it, only to find that the same problem persisted. I got a bad cable, obviously..."
1,Stay away from Staywell,"If you try to install this piece of junk, all you will end up with is an ugly hole in your door, hours wasted, and your extreme anger. It is simply impossible to cut a hole to the exact tolerances required to make this work properly. It doesn't even come with the proper screws to hold it in place properly. I bought one for my cat and one for my dog. I have high-quality wood working equipment and I still couldn't make it work properly. This company is a bunch of swindlers - any one who tried to install this would immediately realize it is an unworkable design."
1,Karaoke Kravitz,"It's not that this is a bad song, it's that Lenny simply mimics the original and leaves me wondering, ""Why is this version necessary?"" I've always been of the opinion that a cover song should cast a new light on a song. It should reveal a different artist's interpretation by playing the song in their style. But Kravitz gives us what we've already heard. I think, perhaps, that he doesn't have a real style to bring to the song. He simply goes through the motions."
3,Pay Careful attention to the dimensions,Product Dimensions: 16.4 x 10.8 x 3.6 inches ; 5.5 pounds Actual baking dimensions - 12x7....this is a TINY tiny pan. If you want to make lasagna for 4 people this is your pan - otherwise ...this is not a lasagna pan for a group. It's TINY!! I'm giving it 3 stars based on the confusing dimensions. I didn't see the second set of dimensions in the product description...I'm sure it's a lovely pan - but I wanted something closer to the 16 by 10.8...the depth is nice.AFTER USEThis is a great pan for roasting veggies. I used it for brussel sprouts and it did a great job. Still didn't meet my needs for a good sized lazagna pan - but it's still a nifty dish. I'd change my stars to 4 if I could.
4,Complete's my set.,I love this dish for making the lasagna my family likes. It complete's my dish set. Not easy to find in the stores.
3,"Convenient, but not good for belly!","I purchased these for our newborn since she was using the soothie pacifier. These were the first bottles she used, and I loved how convenient they were. We took a long road trip and the little canister that attaches to the bottom and holds the formula made bottle making so easy! Unfortunately, these gave our baby bad tummy aches. She had extremely frequent gas as well. We decided to try a different bottle, and within one day her issues were gone and she was the happiest baby. She still is! Also, the nipples are so large, they rub on the babies nose while feeding. So, for convenience, they are wonderful, but for the little bellies, not so great. I would not recommend them."
4,Life is never as perfect as it appears,"A writer/editor comes to terms with her family history and the fallibility of memory. Alice Brill awakens one morning believing something is wrong; it's an intangible, yet strong feeling. In her voyage to discover the cause of her feeling, she questions her writing/career, her marriage, her family, her friendships, and eventually accepts that life is never as perfect as it appears. Very well-written. I enjoyed the interplay between memory and perception, on the one hand, and literal reality, on the other."
1,haven't got it.,I never revived it. it's been over a month since I have bought it and I never got my flag yet. so right now I am very upset. I'm not happy with your company.
1,Amateur effort - not recommended,"Wouldn't recommend it except to fill out your background reading of a fairly obsessive couple preparing to and then climbing. Much better books available such as ""Kilimanjaro: A Guide to Climbing Africa's Highest Mountain, Includes City Guides to Arusha, Moshi, Marangu, Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam"" by Henry Stedman."
3,Good but not memorable for me,"I purchased this cycle with eager anticipation but was frankly disappointed when I opened up the set and popped it in my stereo. I love the CSO/Solti sound (esp the brass section) as much as anybody but I am disappointed with the energy, balance, and precision of entrances and note lengths. If you want a great set, buy the HSO/Eschenbach!"
1,sloppy,"It's sloppy. Interpretation not well thought through. Solti is a well known name, but I wasn't impressed. It sounds uninspired. Check out a different set of the Brahms' symphonies."
4,OOPS! I'm Sorry,"In this otherwise fine set of Brahms symphonies, bottom heavy as I believe Brahms is supposed to be, I think Solti wimps out in the closing measures of the first movement of the Fourth Symphony. This is supposed to be a rare instance of Brahms peeling paint off the walls, and the final cadence and preceding tympani roll should be cataclysmic in its intensity. It's as if the tympani and the rest of the orchestra follows suit and apologizes for being written too loud and then just back off. Kind of spoils the effect with all the noise and busyness going on in that movement. Otherwise, this is a great set. The best overall Brahms I think I've heard so far."
3,"Origins doesn't live up to ""When Genius Failed""","Loved when Genius Failed -- this felt like a grasp at that genius, but a disappointing one. Some is just factually wrong (i.e. portfolios are too risky -- need to factor in bonds and risk-deferral products) and some is just uninteresting. A ""fine"" overview of the stock market run-up to 2001, but there are better treatments of the subject"
5,A must have for P90X Enthusiasts,"I bought this heart rate monitor watch for my P90X workouts and it works great. I read reviews before purchasing the watch that the battery didn't last long, but my initial battery lasted over 3 months. It's very easy to use despite the intimidating manual that came with the watch. The chest strap for the heart monitor is stretched to the max and I'm a medium build guy with a chest of 44"". Anyone bigger than me, the heart rate monitor will either not fit at all or be very tight. I have put the watch and heart rate monitor to good use with the P90X workouts and I like monitoring my heart rate because I am 47 years old and don't want to exceed my maximum heart rate. I recommend it."
2,"Worked great, then...","When this was working, it was 5 stars. Worked great. But after about 12 months the strap on the watch just broke. And they don't make it easy to get a replacement, either, from what I can find"
1,Timex warranty is worthess,"Watch functions fine, looks nice, heart monitor works. But the moment I had it out in light rain, the inside of the face started to fog up, and within a few minutes the display was dead. It was not submerged, or even wet for more than 10 minutes -- evidently it soaks in water like a sponge. This is a ""waterproof"" watch. Before you buy, consider that the 1-year Timex warranty includes an $8 charge for return shipping and handling of the watch (the grossly defective watch that broke under warranty). Not worth it -- no more Timex for me."
1,Bought in Apr10. Stopped working in Oct10,"I bought this watch in April 2010. I was every happy with this product. It helped me train for the 2010 Chicago Triathlon. But it intermittently stopped reading my heart rate in Oct 2010. I changed the battery and it work for a little while and now it stops reading my heart rate in the middle of training. That is extremely frustrate, since I'm doing zone training and using the avg. HR, Total calorie burn and recovery time to track my performance. Before October I would have given it 5 star but it did not even outlive it's warranty. I'm sending it back to Timex (that will cost me another $8 check to Timex plus postage to ship it to them). If I can I will provide an update to this review in 2-4week."
2,"Beauty on the outside, blah on the inside","Appearance: Better looking than many heart rate monitors. Slimmer, not so bulky and a nice color. Could be worn as a regular watch.Heart rate: Seems accurate enough though it often lost track of the signalCalories burned: Completely inaccurate. I was concerned when the user information was limited to a few factors and didn't ask about height etc. The resulting calories were ridiculous: for instance, I doubt I burned 500 calories walking 3 miles."
1,Warning.,"There was nothing wrong with the functions; however, the wrist band that i received was gray. One of the reasons why I got it was because people said it looked aesthetically pleasing and it was okay to wear it when you are not working out. The images on the site show that the wrist band is black which looks nice, but the gray wrist band makes the watch looks really ugly. Decided to send it back, which was the first time i ever had to do that when i bought something online. They weren't able to replace it, only able to refund me."
4,Timex T5,"This Is my second HM and this one is great for the price. My old monitor had the battery in the watch, you could change it but it lost its water proof ability. little long on the learning curve but got it working great."
3,What Am I doing Wrong?,"I was excited to get my 1st HRM and see more accurately how many calories I burn during my aerobics classes & compare it to what the machines & websites say I've burned during my workouts. I've read through the manual numerous times and cannot figure out why my new HRM tells me I've only burned ~110 calories during my hour long Zumba class that leaves me drenched with sweat every time? I've been successful so far in my weight loss/toning & bought this to help me through the last leg to my goal. I really want this to work! I've seen wonderful reviews...couldn't find a review that had this issue. I've entered in my info, changed zone settings to see if that made a difference...nope. I've tested it out numerous times... Sources tell me I burn appx 400 calories in a specific workout...but how can the HRM read 300 calories below? Just looking for a fair reading, in the ballpark... Am I wearing the chest strap wrong? What could it be??"
2,Disappointed - might have been good but not water resistant,"I was looking forward to using this for running. I liked the combination of features, the style, ease of use. I jumped in the pool after my second run with it. When I got out there was water in the crystal. I hadn't pushed any buttons while in the pool and was never more than a couple feet under. My previous Timex's never had this problem."
1,Poor performer,"This product does not allow you to add real information about yourself (i.e., age, weight, height, etc.). The result, calorie burn count comes out about half of what you really burn. Absolutely no accuracy. I sent it back quick."
2,worked great for three months,"Ordered this HRM to maintain target heart rate during workouts. Liked all the features that the watch provides. But like the title, it worked great for three months. Now it is not receiving data from the chest strap. Would wipe down the transmitter after every work and it still crapped out on me. New batteries with a reset did nothing. Well on to search for a new HRM that will last more than a couple months."
4,FIrst HRM watch,I wanted to get a read on my heart rate during my runs and when I was at rest. My rest rate is very low. The watch is easy to use and set up. The actual Monitor fits around your chest and requires a little moisture in order to pick up the Electrical Signal that makes your heart beat. If it is on snug and moistened I believe the rate to be 99% accurate. I read a lot of reviews before pciking this one the one that caught my attention was how easy it was to start using it.
4,My first HRM,"I have run used this HRM for several weeks now and am pretty happy with it. It is my first one, so I have nothing to compare it to. I have found it to be quite easy to use and very helpful in making my runs meaningful. I have used it at the Y a few times and it doesn't work with their machines. I ran a 5k with it and for some reason it didn't start sending a good signal until half way through. I like the cal. function and I like that I can see the heart rate, the zone I am in, and the time all at once.As far as keeping it simple and stupid, this watch is it. Nothing too fancy, just another extremely reliable Timex product."
5,Great HRM watch,"I bought this about 6 months ago, and I love it. It works great, easy to read display with lots of display options to based on what you want to see at the time by simply clicking the Heart Monitor button.The monitor itself is comfortable and provides easy access to change the battery, though mine is still running so I haven't had to change the battery yet.My girlfriend has one as well and we work out together at home in close proximity and have not had any problems with crossed signals or anything like that.The steps in entering your stats (age, weight, etc...) are simple to follow.Bottom line is that it's got lots of features for the price. And I've been using it between 3-6 days a week for nearly 6 months with no issues, and my girlfriend has been doing the same for 3 months and no issues with hers either. There's nothing that screams ""Wow!"" about this watch, it just does what it's supposed to do.I'm glad I didn't waste my money on a Polar."
1,Timex T5J031 Digital Heart Rate Monitor Watch w/Chest Strap,"It worked fine at home; however, when I went to the fitness center and worked up a little sweat, it quit working."
4,worth the money!,I bought this Timex Heart Rate Monitor watch after some research. I stayed away from Polar as the low priced models doesn't allow user to change battery.I used this watch for last 2 weeks in gym. I love it - It looks smart. The price is cheaper than many Polar / Garmin models. It displayes shows HR and Calories burnt plus host other things. Heart Rate and Calories shown are very close to that shown by Life Fitness equipment I used at gym.This is a digital transmission and hence I didn't face in interference from other equipments. It has indiglo for low light viewing.
4,Reliable after 2 years of use,Remains in daily use with only a chest strap battery change (by owner).No frills heart rate monitor. Size of watch is bulky for small wrist (I use next to the tightest strap loop.)
3,beauty vs practicality,"I just got this teapot for christmas. It has great aesthetics and does a great job of brewing tea, but there is one major design flaw. i can't add hot water from my tea kettle because the handle gets in the way. I have to put it in another container, then add it to the teapot. I'm not sure if i can put it directly on a burner on my stove. it is stainless steel, but the shape of the pot makes me think this is not a good idea. so overall, it's disappointing."
3,"Has some good tips, but not the best","This book lacks some serious items, such as maps! The Lonely Planet guide is far superior."
2,Disappointed,"I received this version of the 9 Symphonies for xmas and was very disappointed in the sound quality of the recording. The numbered movements in the 9th are not as listed, and one must change discs to hear the 9th in entirety. I don't know what the big deal is about Solti's jerky interpretations, and the quality of the orchestra's performance is mediocre. Poor intonation permeates their renditions and gives one the feeling this is a special edition of bad takes. There's nothing wrong with Beethoven, and the poor recording may not be doing justice to Solti and his orchestra, but be forewarned that this is a poor set of recordings. PolyGram should apologize. If I could get my money back, I would purchase Szell's recordings. Szell is still the man in my opinion."
4,A quickie TV and TV inspired Science fiction overview,"Narrated by William Shatner, we get a whirlwind overview of TV guides of memorable moments of sci-fi through the decades. Too bad this is a 1997 overview which means we are missing a decade or so of more recent TV programs and inspired movies. I could think of a few missed programs but I also found some old ones that I forgot about.Now with the DVR craze all of them are coming back or back for the first time for many people. I think it is time for a new TV Guide look at Science fiction.Speaking about all the old stuff you need to look for ""The Bamboo Saucer"" (1968) with Lois Nettleton who was in Twilight Zone (1 episode, 1961) The Midnight Sun as Norma."
4,"Star Wars Then and...well, just back then, really","In its time, this was a great resource for any true Star Wars geek. The entries are very thorough and reach into the most remote of minutiae within the Star Wars universe. Entries include characters, planets, events, and things that are uniquely of the Star Wars galaxy.However, be aware that if you want a complete and up to date encyclopedia, this is no longer the source to rely on, as there is nothing from the prequels or anything since 1998 in here."
4,Suzanne who? Yes THE SUZANNE GORMAN,"All of a sudden fully by surprise this record came to my view. I listen to it and i only thought. I MUST HAVE IT.Great songs, great singer. We can think Range Records for believing in her and Joe Mattis for a great production. Listen to it folks and you will agree."
3,eh,"Its ok for the price, but there are much much better knives (Bessey) for a few bucks more.cons- Very bulky and thick. Takes up a bunch of room and gets in the way when you try to use it- You need a screwdriver to change blades, you need to take the knife apart for this.- The blade retracts when you apply pressure to it - major conpros- Price- Can store a few extra blades inside"
5,Love this purchase!,"With a doubt, the best purchase I made this year.. It was a small gift for myself and am enjoying it daily. Thanks for the expedited delivery of my wish item."
3,flashlight,"It look better than it apeare.I really have a problem to slide battery in, outlet for battery is in poor condition (is moving and shaking lake gelly !!!)very very easly to breake!!"
2,From Back Cover,"ONE MAN, ONE WOMAN... ONE VERY TINY CABINBecause of the terms of a will, Garrett Holden had to share his stepfather's tiny cabin in Maine with Ana Birch for one month. A hardened businessman, Garrett was lost moments after meeting the beautiful stranger, and he knew spending thirty days together would be pure torture on his libidoBut as hard as he tried to resist Ana's charms, the die-hard bachelor was quickly captivated by her compassionate nature, her zest for life... and her tempting curves. Still, Ana's true identity remained a mystery - who exactly was the lovely Ana Burch, why was she named in the will... and how could he walk away from her once the thirty days were up?3rd in the Billionaire Bachelors series"
2,*** MDX Solution didn't have the solutions ***,My company is a retail chain of 320 stores. I have been in and out of this book for more than two months. I have yet to find any solutions to my company's interest. Not one MDX example has paralleled a design that I am doing for my company. I recommend another MDX book.
4,Nice,"Susan O'Brien has had an interest in natural foods and nutrition. She has used this interest to aid her in her own dietary needs. She had worked as a gourmet cook, cooking instructor, baker and as a consultant for food management, as well as medical education.Each recipe is labelled as to what the recipe is free of, such as no dairy, no eggs, and no nuts, as well as being sugar-free and gluten-free. The recipes are easy-to-follow and are delicious.This cookbook, also, does not have photographs or illustrations. There is a chapter on how to substitute sugar and wheat flour for other products, in an effort to increase creativity and independence. There is, also, a resource guide to help you find those hard-to-find ingredients.Some of the delicious recipes you can find in this book are: Potato Scones, Blackberry Cobbler, Prosciutto and Veggies, Quinoa and Tofu, Chai Tea and Meatballs."
4,A Family and Consumer Science Teacher's Point of View,"I was immediately attracted to this book just because of the title. I obviously can't have flour and sugar. I actually haven't cooked anything from the book, but will this Thanksgiving. The hardest part I know about not being able to eat flour and white sugar for health reasons is feeling deprived of desserts and baked goods. When you love to bake this is torture! I seem some very edible and tasty recipes for baking. I am however, not so impressed with the main course. The author assumes you will eat some strange things that many people do not like or may find hard to get. If you live in a rural area, you are going to struggle getting some of these ingredients for all the recipes in the book. However, I'm sure you can shop online for them. Buy it just for the baked goods, but don't expect to change your dinner menu all that much."
3,"Gluten Free, Sugar Free Cooking",This book is giving me uncentive to continue with my health improvements. It lets me know I can cook/bake alternatives.
4,Infinite possibilities and long term toy,"My 5 yo son's teachers said this was his favorite toy at school so Santa gave it to him for Christmas 2010. An instant hit with him, my husband & even me! He's got a good imagination any way but this toy enhances it - he builds spaceships, pirate swords, a sledding tobagan, the helicopter (w/Daddy) - you name it, he'll build it out of No Ends. Only downside for us is that most things he wants to build are large & take up room and we're low on space. I would get these for as young as 4 (could be too much a hitting tool for younger ones) and our 9 yo friends loved them too."
2,Ehhhh,"I wasn't that impressed with this book. I love the flowy, relaxed cottage style, but this just wasn't for me. I found a few pages that I liked, but for the most part I could have done without it. The pictures weren't that crisp and it seemed a little too dated for me. Don't let that get in the way of your decision though, if you think it's what you want then by all means honey don't let me stop you! I'll just stick to my magazines if I'm looking for cottage inspiration and decorating tips."
5,If Hell had a soundtrack...,"This would be it! I frequently listen to dark ambient music to set a nice mood when I'm writing. There is lots of good stuff out there, but The Sowing is the best collection I've ever heard. Some of this music is actually scary - no joke. I have yet to listen to the entire album straight through because after one or two songs I need to stop to collect my thoughts. This isn't easy listening background music, nor is it one of those collections that could be used for your fun little haunted house on Halloween - unless it's like the most demented Halloween haunted house in history!Seriously, whatever your reasons for listening to ambient music like this, you will be hard pressed to find a better collection than this one. Buy it - you'll be glad you did. Just don't listen with the lights off. Trust me!"
4,chicken fryer,"I love my chicken fryer it is so versitile, it is the most used pan in my cupboard. The only problem I had was that the cover exploded, thank goodness the top crumbles like auto glass and no one got hurt. This is the first problem I have ever had. Is there a way to obtain a new lid and how."
4,pretty good,If you are a history buff or always wanted to know what has happened in New York City-you need to check out this easy to read book. It talks about the history of 42nd Street from the theaters to politics. Very enjoyable read.
5,GOOD MUSIC,"Man this album was really good. a collection of all of there hit songs.Forget Glee,S Club 7 needs to come back together and put out an album.I used to watch their show all the time and ever since I bought this CD,I can now reminisce on the good days when we had good music with meaning and substance.there songs are positive unlike most of today's music.I would recommend this CD to anyone who is an S Club 7 fan.Standout tracks: ""Bring It All Back"",""S Club Party"",""Two In A Million"",""Never Had A Dream Come True"",""Natural"",""You're My Number One""."
1,Item not received!,I was rather confused to be asked to review an item that I have never received! I hope I haven't been charged.
1,Pitiful,"This was among the least romantic books I have ever read. The heroine - Samone never really told the hero, Jon that she loved him. Samone treated Jon as someone to spend time with until a black man comes along. It is just as well there was no mention of marriage, because one got the sense that this relationship will not last. There was no real love or passion. If like me you like your love scenes to be passionate if not steamy, this book is a complete let down - the love scenes are treated as an afterthought. For example, this is a bulid up to a love scene, "" Jon turned off the lights and turned up the music."" The next paragraph begins with ""Morning. Samone woke in a panic."" If I could have given less than one star I would. Do not waste your money!"
5,Duran Duran at their Best!,"Duran Duran's Debut album is without a doubt my favorite! This Album is raw and undoubtly the best Duran Duran music you'll ever hear! This album isn't full of catchy hits like on Rio, instead it has FANTASTIC obscure songs that everyone loves! My favorites are, 'Night Boat', 'Careless Memories' and 'Planet Earth'! This Album is much darker and indepth than Duran Duran's other albums. (not saying that's a bad thing though)This is the best possible Duran Duran album DD could have made to introduce themselves to the world! This is a MUST for any Duranie, Garenteed!"
5,Brought My DAW Studio To Life!,"Great converters as stated! No hiss or humm as otheres have said, and works flawless on XP(SP3). I am running Cubase 5 and no major issiues. ASIO 2.0 is very stable which is the reason I decided on this unit. I no longer have to rely on 3rd party software, because of the ultral low latency, which I might add is almost invisable! I have not used for a mic yet but am looking forward to it! The Echo Gina 3G is for me!"
3,The Days of the Dinosaur Coloring Book,"Upon review of this coloring book, I found it to be a bit older in the storyline and images than I expected. I purchased it for my 5-1/2 year old grandson. While I know he'll enjoy it, it's more appropriate for older children."
5,Zen Blues(!),"I heard the greatest bluegrass singer who ever lived, John Duffey, remark once how he judged other singers mainly on the one thing you can't teach--either the've got it or they don't. Soul, that is. Kelley Joe Phelps has got it. No one's ever played blues just like this. It's Zen Blues, I guess, songs new and familiar (Irene Good Night(!)), yet like you've never heard them before."
1,lightweight cheap junk,i have watched MARIO BATALI for years he taught me a lotabout cooking and travel. i bought this spoon because he has his name on it.i oiled it twice before using with commercial butcherblock productit chipped anyway i take care of my kitchen tools his cast iron is finea little heavy but OK .if you need a wooden spoon opt for olive woodi have never written a bad review for a good productallways wondered if the competition or just idiots wrote themi was really dissapointed come on mario.
3,Would have rated these 5 stars,"I've had a set of these spatulas for about two years. I use them every day. The wood has not held up at all. If the handles were metal, they would be perfect. Black mold has formed around where the handle connects to the silicone and up inside where the handle fits into the silicone. The silicone not only slips off the handle, but the wood in that area has started to turn whitish and peel. On the other hand I guess two years of constant usage is bound to have an effect on wood. I have put them in the dishwasher, and I'm sure that's not good.I'm shopping on Amazon today for heat proof silicone spatulas with stainless steel handles."
3,Depends on What You Want,"OSS is just what it claims to be--a history of the OSS. And somewhat tedious and dry for just that reason.Unfortunately, that isn't exactly what I wanted, which was tales of OSS activities and shenanigans all over the world. I'll have to try elsewhere. You can find my copy of OSS on the Goodwill shelf for cheap."
1,wrong cd inside,"all is fine but the cd inside for practice de songs is wrong and is a guitar collection not violin, amazon you must send me de ok version of this cd."
3,I have the 4gb version of this drive,"I've had the 4gb version of this drive for about 3 years. I picked it up for about $35 at Panthip in Bangkok. It was by far the cheapest 4gb flash drive there. Prices have come down since then. The drive still works just fine. I never lost any data. I've reformatted it a bunch of times and it still works great. My only complaint that it's slow. This is the slowest of all my flash drives. Reading data isn't bad, but the write time is very slow. That's why I only give it 3 stars. Maybe my 4gb is an older model than this 2gb model? I've never tried any of A-Data's other products, but mine in particular is not a High Speed flash drive."
5,Understanding Northwest Culture,"This classic work by Bill Holm is not only a thorough account of Northwest Coast Art, culture by culture, through discussion of particular artifacts, one by one, but a window into the cultures for whom those artifacts were life itself. I read every word of it. I have lived in the region for many years and value the deeper understanding of the history that came before."
3,And you wondered who ruled the world,"Sometimes you wonder , how on earth could the world be left to be managed by the free hand or whatever economic theories you believe in . Although i would not like to give away the whole idea behind the book ,i found it full of interesting historical stories on how a secret sosciety evolved through the ages till today, and how a great bunch of politicians , scientists , artists and others adhered to it's concepts. The world is ruled by theese people . It is a fascinating book although the link at the end with the third building of the temple in Jerusalem , make you think that it was added by somebody else for whatever unknown secret reason . I recomend this book because it gave me a new perspective on who was really governing the earth ."
5,"Second Edition is thicker, better ... great book!",I just bought the second edition of this book. I loved the first and learned a lot. This book has a lot of practical information. The second edition covers Solaris 8 and Solaris 9 along with updates on the chapters from the first edition. This is one of my favorite Unix books.
2,Beware! Tracks Are From Analog Tape And Vinyl!,"The disc I received is nothing more than a bootleg of tracks transfered from tape and vinyl sources. The disc is a CD-R and the inserts are laser printed.As bootlegs go, it's nicely done. But, it's still a bootleg and until a legitimate source for the tracks becomes available, this is probably the best you can get.So... Buyer Beware!"
3,"Good, but not her best work","I liked the stories and I thought the plots were fairly original and as usual the twist ending but I got bored. I think that they both should have been shorter. If you haven't read any Tanith Lee, I wouldn't start here, instead read The Flat Earth novels 1st they are absolutely fabulous!"
1,Unusable on my XP,"I am completely disappointed in this product. It appears that the games require the CD in the drive to play, but I wouldn't really know because I couldn't get most of them to play, and I had to reboot my computer to get out of some of them. When I tried to register online (8 or 10 times on different days) I got an error that their web page couldn't be found. I would love to get my money back for this worthless pack."
4,Everyone should read this book,"This is really just one of those books everyone should read. It's highly relevant because Ford didn't have an axe to grind with anyone. He was an entreprenuer/auto magnate. Moreover, it was written by an American before Hitler and Mein Kampf, shattering the popular myth that ""anti-semitism"" had only existed since World War 2. The book more importantly speaks very candidily about jewish question and about it's influence in sports, theatre and press among other important topics. Its certainly worth everyone's time to read it."
1,Frightening what people will believe...,"I have nothing against conspiracies, but logic would dictate that people look at the world around them before believing this type of garbage. I'm shocked to find Americans reading a book that basically says that the Nazis are right. Remember, Germany during World War II was the enemy.I also find it amusing that [anyone would] state that this is not anti-semitic, while also saying that it reveals the ""evil Jew."" Anti-semitism means ""prejudiced against or hostile toward Jews"" per Webster's Dictionary. This book is clearly hostile toward Jews. Thus, it is by definition anti-Semitic.Think for yourself! Don't believe garbage! And don't buy this book. You don't want to support people who put out this type of vile stuff."
2,Different,This one is not the same as the original Jewel Quest. It is not the original one we first bought in the store that we miss placed
4,"Tight book, G. Just like a movie.","This guy is obsessed with graphic sex scenes. It's a good plot, though. It's interesting to think about man's origins, and how man would interact with his supposed ancestors. Mr. P writes well, although not very deeply."
1,Too annoying to be entertaining,"I don't understand the many 5-star ratings for this book. The cover gives away that this is a story about hominids having survived into 21st century Africa (not only one, but two species, as we learn later). Next, the author tells us within the first five pages what this story is about: hominids mating. Then there are the dumb dialect of some of the African characters - ""After we kill dem, do we pull out deir teeth and put dem on da imami tree for luck?"" (p. 494) - and the repeated descriptions of hominid reproductive organs.I could forgive the cliche characters, predictable story, and hominid (and human) sexual activities if the book were at least well written, but the narrative is a disaster. It hops haphazardly from one character to the next from a poorly executed 3rd person omniscient point of view, and the author has apparently never heard of the writing maxime ""show, don't tell""."
3,A good start,"This is a promising work from someone new to the Anglo-Saxon literature. Petru Popescu is Romanian, and therefore his style and language are not as polished as expected from your average American author. His Latin lyricism translates oddly at times, and his descriptions are long and detailed. Character developing is uneven, but this is a minor sin compared to other aspects you will find worthwile.Overall, it's a good book, and shows an great interest in social studies. This twist brings new life to an idea as old as Arthur Conan Doyle's ""Lost World"". Give it a chance - if you want more than other (similarly-priced) brainless slam-bang, you might like it."
3,Disappointing,"You can read about the plot in the synopses. I thought this book would be really exciting, but it wasn't. The author just didn't make the plot sizzle. I did enjoy the anthropological/social dissertations comparing proto-humans with modern homo sapiens, and how we may have developed.Your time would be better spent reading something else. Sorry."
2,Almost Adam is almost good,"I had high expectations for this book when I read the premise: An American scientist caught in a wild section of Africa with an ancient race. But Popescu drags this out a little longer than needed by spending too many pages on the young Long Toes and his business and with several extremely boring chapters with the corporate psychos trying to take credit for the ancient discovery. Their importance is insignificant in the grand scheme of things.The most interesting parts are when Lauder is interacting with the humans, which unfortunately, are only at the very beginning and the very end. He still feels like somewhat of an outsider being a white man in an African world which leads to tension between himself and the ones closest to him.This book could have been several hundred pages shorter and would have made more of a suspenseful tale."
3,Good Sears primer,If you are new to Dr Sears and sleep is your only issue this would be a nice choice. I found lots of the sleep ideas in The Baby Book which also has everything else you need about raising your baby. The Baby Book would be my first choice from Sears.
3,"A good read, but no real answers","I got this with the 'No-Cry Sleep Solution' and would recommend it as an acessory read for that book. It is educational, but it didn't really help me get a baby that would sleep through the night."
3,wanted more english hyms,"I think the problem for me is that it is hard to make the words in each song. It sounds foreign to me, but I think is that I can hear clear enough. The one that arraingned this cd writes that we need to concentrate..however, I think that the truth is that no matter how hard you concentrate, you cannot make out 80% of what it is been said...."
5,excellent,this company is excellent to deal with i got my series in great time and in excellent condition it was a great series we had a great time watching it there is nothing better to watch than the old western series we love them thank youcatherine fletcher
5,MATO IS A GREAT GUITARIST,"I have seen Indigenous and Mato w/o Indigenous. He is one of the BEST Guitarist today. I have seen him at least six (6) times. I agree with the other Reviewer that Mato has been understated. Because he is not MainStream he has not gotten the attention he deserves. I have seen some great guitarists in my time including Jimi Hendrix who will always be my favorite.Jimi was the ORIGINAL Blues Innovator,and Mato follows in that vein. When he does Red House you would surely agree.A friend gave me an audio copy of this DVD and I just love it. Somehow Mato is not playing much these days and I crave to hear and see him play once again. I wanted to order this DVD and now it is not available. I just hope that soon it will be. If you want to get introduce to Mato's music or have seen hin live(which is the BEST) I recommend getting this DVD if they get it back in stock."
1,Wireless range for this is weak.,Wireless range on this is weak. I have an intel card that reads 4/5 bars when this adapter reads 2/5 bars. I like netgear equipment but can't recommend this adapter.
2,Weak collection,"I love anthologies because usually I'm sure to love one or two stories and like most of the rest. However only one story, ""A Watery Silence"" from editor Mosiman, stood out for me. ""The Last Battle"" had potential but didn't have a resolution and ""Mrs. Lurie and the Rapture"" contained a lot of unnecessary stuff. The surprise ending for ""With the Sword He Must Be Slain"" was nice but frankly the story didn't grab me, maybe I'm not cut out for military fiction. For a book of stories about the end of the world I expected to be thrilled and maybe scared; I didn't feel either of those."
4,Hauntingly unusual,"This intriguing, relaxing album showcases female Scandinavian musicians. It gently reminds us that many different musical traditions exist in the Nordic lands, and that these roots have value and beauty both in their own right, and as seeds of inspiration for modern interpretation. The artists featured are Susanne Rosenberg, Tone Hulbaekmo, Tallari, Susanne Lundeng, Hege Rimestad, Tellu, Mari Eggen and Helene Hoye, Aurora Borealis, Asne Sunniva Soreide, Helen Hoye, Annbjorg Lien, Sinikka Langeland, Kirsten Braten Berg, and Pernille Anker. They combine the soothing and mysterious sounds of traditional singing with instruments old and new. Other samplers of neo-traditional Scandinavian music include NorthSide's ""Nordic Roots"" series, and the World Music Network's ""Rough Guide to the Music of Scandinavia""."
5,Absolutely Lovely,"This album is over an hour long - a great value. So many different artists, and the variety of styles is a nice surprise."
1,Does not fit the CGP-D28.,I picked up this piece for my son's camcorder. It DOES NOT fit the CGP-D28 type battery.
5,works like it should,this product can be plug and play if you just need a ethernet bridge in another part of your home that is not wired or out of wireless range. if you use slingbox you may need to refer to their online help to reconfigure your router. not that hard to do and i am not a computer wizard. the Sling telephone support is EXCELLENT. i went and purchased another set for just the bridging capability in other rooms. they are priced cheaper than most other ethernet bridges.
5,Super easy setup and works like a charm,I purchased this to use with my newly acquired Slingbox Pro. All I had to do was plug these into wall outlets and connect the Lan wires. Worked like a charm...couldn't believe it was that easy. Great performance and good price from Amazon.
5,Cheikh Meftah Algerian Trab Music,"This music is so authentic and so real; no wonder it is called Trab (earth) Music. This is the kind of music my mother listened to when I was a child. It brought back memories, sentiments, and tastes from a while back. I am going to take it home when I go visit this summer and listen to it with my mom. I loved it so much it almost made me cry. It's been playing nonstop in my car."
4,Buy it!,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, it seemed clear to me that the ""introduction,"" ""postscript"" and footnotes that others assumed where ""true"" are part of the text and are also fiction. Gaarder did not find these letters; his story of finding them is part of the story (here he is honoring Jorge Luis Borges). It is a short, but deeply intriguing story. The book does raise serious concerns about elements of Augustine's theology (especially the doctrine of creation; is creation good?). At the same time, it tells a painfully truthful story of lost love."
4,an alternative view,"""vita brevis"" holds controversial issues concerning one of the most renowned saints in the catholic church. gaarder puts forward an alternative view to salvation and its hold on st augustine.the book is structured based on the views of the catholic faith from an athiest perpective with the loss of a woman's man to his faith. clearly documented with footnotes to hold its authenticity, leaving the reader (especially catholic readers) to question whether the letters are true or not.gaarder beautifully pieces the letters, intertwining faith and worldly philosophy and questions its opposing relationship formed within humans.if you're up for serious reading and religious insight, don't let this book pass you by!"
4,"Moving, unexpected book","I devoured this strangely moving book in about two hours, stranded inside a car during one of my former boyfriend's windsurfing forays - and closed it with a curious mixture of lingering anguish and that joy that sometimes comes with absolute recognition. The love story depicted here is very touching and anything but predictable. Some deep truths concerning love, endurance and the making of choices, are conveyed here through Floria's long-vanished voice."
4,World War I,"Something happened to George Enescu, who had composed some pretty good music prior to WWI. Romanian Rhapsody No. 1 is fine fiddling, but some like Symphony 2 were so disorganized that it only had one performance during his lifetime and someone who didn't have to pay royalties brought it out after his death.The Symphony N. 2 does force me to concentrate, and to my amazement my blood sugar went down to 111 at 5PM. I was trying to make some sense out of it.As near as I can figure, Enescu tried to form a society that encouaged composition. Bucharest Philharmonic George Enescu Orchestra was named after him when he died in Paris in 1955. He has performed and recorded the violin reperatory after leaving Romania because of Soviet Realism's deadening effects. This 4 CD set has much of his published works."
4,Useful and entertaining,"Through short and useful conversations that will be surely necessary for everyone that travels in Netherlands, you can learn dutch using three cds and a 40-page booklet.The only disadvantage is that the numbers are not written as words with letters so it's difficult to learn them."
2,"Helpful, but a little cynical","Small book that is easy to read, but somewhat out of date (as another reviewer noted, no info about some of the newer options like hip resurfacing). Read the excerpts here; e.g., first few pages are a little bit cynical, but guess that goes with the title."
4,good book,"very good advice , highly recommend, somewhat skeptical of medical field with good suggestions of how to avoid problems by asking the right questions(I'm in the medical field and agree with his views) john"
5,How Prayers of a stranger changed Her Life,"Carol's life was all about money, and then someone prayed for her. She had even had an abortion herself. The man who prayed for her really had no way of knowing that his prayer would change the course of her life. This former abortion seller, money maker, began to talk girls out of having abortions. This is a very interesting book. It was quite life changing for Carol. It really spoke to my heart, and I think it would speak to yours as well. Give it a chance. Once you start, it is hard to put it down! Be sure you keep the tissues handy! A really good read and a true life story!"
5,"Beautiful, timeless, & melancholy","MC&V;'s second album doesn't disappoint. From the graceful sad notes of 'Valentine Song' & 'Always Something New' to the jaunty beat of 'Mama, I Don't Want To Go Insane' & 'Land Beyond The Sea', these guys have tremendous range, musical dexterity, and intelligent lyrics that suggest a life lived, a soul travelled, a heart broken.Some of my favorite lyrics from this album include:""I've been looking for an answer / in every drop of wine / and the whiskey shines like gold / but there's no way / it could ever keep my heart from feeling lonely all the time / oh mama I don't want to go insane""""When I was younger / I was such a sight to see / when I believed that I could win""I've introduced these guys to men and women, from their twenties to their fifties, and they've all been moved by the great lyrics and Matty's voice, which is like pure warm honey. This album is a treasured part of my collection, and its tracks are played all the time on my iPod."
5,"November 22, 1963 Re-lived","I was a few months shy of age 10 then JFK was assassination, but it remember that day (and weekend) vividly. The DVD has a lot of footage that I have never seen and some that is all-too-familiar. This is a must-have for history buffs."
4,SIN WAS A GOOD MOVIE!,"A RETIRED DETECTIVE [VING RHAMES] GOES BACK TO UNDERCOVER TO CATCH A SADISTIC CRIMINAL [GARY OLDMAN]. THINK OF IT AS A DEATH WISH-TYPE MOVIE. THE MOVIE HAS GOOD ACTING, GOOD ACTION, AND A THRILLING STORY. I THINK EVERYBODY DID A GOOD JOB IN THIS MOVIE. SURE, IT'S NOT ALWAYS ON THE MONEY, BUT, IT IS AN ENTERTAINING MOVIE. AS ALWAYS, VING RHAMES PLAYS THE TOUGH GUY AND HE DOES A GOOD JOB AT IT TOO. AND GARY OLDMAN ALSO DOES A VERY GOOD JOB AT PLAYING THE VILLAIN. THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE WHOLE MOVIE IS THE QUICKSAND SEQUENCE. THAT SCENE WAS SERIOUSLY THRILLING. I ADVISE EVERYONE TO GET DOWN TO YOUR LOCAL VIDEOSTORE AND RENT THIS NOW!"
4,I love the book -but THIS EDITION HAS SERIOUS ISSUES,"Not only does this edition contain many typos, the green background does not help with reading it... specially under circumstances when light isn't optimal. Since you're supposed to read each scroll for 30 days, 3 times per day, you might frequently find yourself needing to read under dim, low, or simply suboptimal lighting. The conventional white background over white letters would work much more efficiently.Also, to the editorial, please get better translations and check for typos...."
4,Pastor Spann,"I purchased the DC DXG-301V Digital Video Recorder for my son who will be graduating this year from high school and he thought it would be fun to record his last few months with his friends. It's easy to use and very compact and if you're like me, if your child is happy then you're happy."
2,Works better for stills than for video.,"As a video camera, the DC DXG-301v leaves a lot to be desired. Mine records sound terribly, and the video comes out ""pixelly"" if I'm moving around. I find the stills, however, to be of great detail (I can see the wrinkles around my eyes...wait a minute...is this a good thing?). That being the one good feature isn't enough to make up for the other problem: the software. This camera comes with some cheesy brand of software that caused my computer to malfunction, then the problems ceased when I uninstalled the software. A friend who had the same software installed for a different camera said their computer was malfunctioning before I advised them to uninstall that particular software. Personally, I think you can do better for the money."
3,Not bad but not great,"It does hold gift bags. But if the gift bags are really long or tall then they flop over. If you have tissue paper or small gift bags then this great. But supplement this with another gift wrapping holder. It accommodates flat items that are small to medium, not large!P"
4,Good Cd,"I have never been a Norman Hutchins fan. However, this was a really good CD. There are only a few songs that I fast forward. The background vocals were great and so was the overall production of the CD. I enjoy this CD and listen to it often. I really like track 2 and I play track 6 at least 5 times before I can go to the next song. I really recommend buying this CD. You'll find that you'll like more tracks than you dislike. That's always important. This is not a CD with 1-3 good tracks."
1,Travelling music if you travel in elevators.,"Or you love moving through aisles in supermarkets. Muzak,not music.A bland blend of ambient, new age, and country cliches.For crisp, cinematic, guitar- driven travel music that breathes wide open spaces, get any of the 2 Pell Mell cd's.Or if reading Euphoria's reviews, the thought of a mix of techno and country-gospel interested you, go for A3's Exile on Coldharbour Lane."
3,Let the Music Take the Wheel,"Looking for the perfect CD to listen to while taking a short road trip? Well, this album comes close to being ""THE ONE"". I purchased this CD out of mere curiosity and I was delightfully surprised. The album is fulled with organic-like electronica and humbled by random guitar appearances. The song ""Delerium"" is the album's leadoff tune which is worthy of setting the tone for a relaxing drive. ""Heaven"" follows up by continuing the dizzying appeal of the album. Just when you think it's time to change the CD, ""Wait for You"" rushes in like a radiant woman who knows her worth. Wide open spaces and percussion combinations carry the weight of the album. I reccomend this album to anyone who likes to listen to electronic music but isn't in the mood for an ambush of sound. Listening to this disc will cleanse your ears as you ride off into the sunset..."
2,Delirium is the exception,"I bought this CD because I enjoyed listening to Delirium on WXPN in Philadelphia. That tune sounds to me like a combination of Moby and Afro Celt Sound System. But the rest is completely different and a far weaker match to my taste. The only other track I like is the last one, The Road. Maybe it's the vocals in the other tracks that turn me off."
4,Great box...a tad expensive,"I love this litter box. I have tried MANY automatic boxes, and this is by far the best. I have to agree with the others who say it is expensive to maintain. Once you figure out how to put the waste bag in, it is VERY easy and CLEAN! The liners run $5+ dollars, but you only have to replace the liner about once a month. I recommend using it on a hard floor surface, as I had a little trouble when I moved it to a carpeted floor."
1,"Don't buy this book! It is not the ""real"" Nancy Drew!","I bought this for my 8-year-old daughter, expecting another winner in the great Nancy Drew series. Be warned that this ain't one of them. This book is a modernized version of Nancy, and not a very nice modernization. If you're wondering how the same author, Carolyn Keene, can keep cranking out new novels after 70 years, she can't; it's a committee of authors. This one is so ""modern"" that it's really a turn-off. It's not the Nancy we all know and love and grew up with."
4,Good Holiday Mystery,"This is one of the early Susan Henshaw mysteries. Susan is getting prepared for the usual Christmas fesitivies when her mother in law cuts a vacation short, arrives a week early, and is on a new diet. She criticizes everything they eat and seems to survive on microvaved meals found in a plastic bag. She seems to be in love with the inventor of her meals, an abrasive podiatrist who considers himself a nutrition expert. A neighbor seems to be going off the deep end. She is recently divorced and he and his new wife have built a house directly behind hers. The husband turns up dead during a Christmas party at the new house, only he is dead in his old house. The police are called, but the body disappears.This is an exceptionally good holiday mystery. The suburban wives and former wives are pretty strange in Hancock as usual. Kathleen and Susan have a more difficult time than usual solving the crime and entertaining relatives at the same time."
5,I totally agree with reviewer Gay Ashley,"Yes, I agree with Gay Ashley, this book is great. Harban's rich and varied colour photographs of wooden bobbins bring this facinating subject to life. I recently purchased a 3 spindle, 4 ply oak/pine hybrid bobbin, and was amazed to learn it was worth four dollars more than the fifty three dollars I paid for it. Of course, this marvellous wooden world would not be complete without the commentary of Graham Fellowes, and let's face it, he's at his best when he's talking bobbins."
1,old news,"Cartoons of O.J. Simpson, Tonya Harding, Santa Claus and John Lennon appear on the cover of Loudon Wainwright III's Social Studies, and that should give you some idea of the scattershot material preserved inside. Culled mostly from tunes he wrote over a ten-year period as drop-ins for National Public Radio, the disc shows Wainwright at his least insightful, his least imaginative and his least interesting. The kind of tossed-off style that can be charming in his more personal material is annoying when applied to topical matters - especially when those same subjects are joked on radio, television and comedy club stages. I suspect that Wainwright doesn't think he's saying anything profound when he offers lines like ""Ice used to be a nice thing/When you laced up figure skates/Now it's a thing to win a medal on/For the United States."" But he's not saying anything particularly funny either. Or very musically interesting."
4,my portable air purifier,"The first time I purchased this machine two years ago it was great! because it came with a 110v/220v dual transformer, so I could use it overseas. The machine is great, but this time it came with only a 110v transformer."
5,you get what you give,"This ia an excellent book for young children. It has bright and active pictures to keep them captivated, and has a charming and meaningful story. Each pig gets what they deserve, the selfish pig learns her lesson, and all live cooperatively ever after."
3,An overrated record.,"When this record came out, _Rolling Stone_ gave it five stars and compared it to Lennon's _John Lennon_. Listening to simply embarrassing songs like ""Ebony and Ivory,"" one wonders how the response could have been so strong; then again, McCartney has a large reservoir of good feeling among '60s-generation critics. This isn't even one of his own three best solo albums. It has some good songs and some junk, plus two lousy bits with Wonder."
3,Good,"This is not the essential McCartney. In fact, I like ""Back To The Egg"" much better, because it's less produced.Ebony and Ivory is a horrible song. The other Stevie Wonder collaboration, ""What's That You're Doing,"" is a great, funky exchange that features Wonder's signature keyboards and Paul's outstanding bass.Some filler here, ""Wonderlust,"" ""Ballroom Dancing,"" etc,. but good tracks surround them."
3,OK,"Yeah, this album has some good songs, but it is a typical McCartney solo album -- a lot of filler (Get It, What's That You're Doing, etc.) mixed in."
5,Fear not the No Fear!,"As one reviewer noted this 'translation' is suspect in some placesThough I might almost agree with that assessment (doesn't any translation have it's detractors?), at the same time the original text is right there for you to examine on your own, and these 'No Fear' editions simply are the BEST way to make Shakespeare accessible! I LOVED this book and can't recommend it enough - I went back and bought 'Midsummer Night's Dream' and can't wait to read it!"
3,"Great songs, but poor MP3 quality for about half","After downloading the whole album and listening to MP3s, a number of songs seemed to ""overload"" my headphones (distortion, like it was at high volume... even though it wasn't).So, I thought my speakers would sound better... but they indicated same problem. Notably, tracks 2, 5, 6, 8, 11, 15, 16 & 18. Others had only slight issues but OK.I have plenty of other MP3s, WMAs which do not have this much distortion at the same volume. Makes me wish I bought the CD (even though it was twice the price of MP3s)... actually, I will buy the CD, cuz I like these toonz. :-)"
3,Not adjustable-but good quality,"The item description leads one to believe it is adjustable, but it is not. Essentially, it is stretchy in the back and your infant's head must be at least 48cm to fit. It is WAY too big for my 3-month-old son, who has a rather large noggin. :) Anyway, the quality of the hat is quite good and I kept it to use when he gets older. I'm still looking for a smaller NC State infant hat that will fit my 3-month-old son."
2,Just a dumb movie,"It's dumb. Its supposed to be dumb. It's supposed to be acted dumb. It was written dumb. So if you're expecting something other than dumb, you're dumb lol.Just go with it and don't expect a masterpiece."
1,STUPID,This movie is not worth the money...it's less then a B movie....I would like a refund. Do not buy a waste of money
3,The Ghost B.C.,"Another good job by movie makers with no money but have a little sense of film making. interseting characters, good build up good effects job. Good story, rounds itself out nicely. worth a rental for low budget Zombie fans."
2,''A let down....'',"I've never read this author before, but she needs to learn about proper grammer, tenses, & spelling ! Yes, the book sort of holds your interest, but it was advertised as having alot of violent sex.....WHERE? She just sort of has her characters jump around & though her story line was good, she needs MUCH improvement. I was very angry that I spent alot on this book & the author's not ready to be published."
5,Great book,"This book was beautifully written, and is a rare jewel for Christian fiction. None of the ""Jesus talk"" felt forced, and I was encouraged to live like Miss Abigail and Ella Mae, serving as the hands and feet of Jesus to a broken world."
5,I think Mr. Walsh must have gotten a defective pan,"I have this pan and love it. In fact, I only found the above review because I'm buying another one so I'm not limited to sauteing one thing at a time.This pan is the best I've used, and the nonstick works great. Either Mr. Walsh got a defective pan or he misused it. One thing I discovered (to my regret on my 10 inch pan) was that you can't cook with them over extremely high heat or it ruins the non-stick coating. However, for all other applications (I usually saute chicken breasts or cook eggs in mine), it works fine and is easy to clean."
2,Find some tools and a real small plastic tool box instead,"I picked this up for my son's 4th birthday as a spur of the moment gift. It turned out that it was his favorite toy. He loves it! Unfortunately, the latch on the tool box kept popping off and broke within a week. So, I went to Sear's and bought him a real small black craftsman plastic toolbox. Now he can close it himself and it really closes. I'd suggest getting a fun set of kids tools instead and a real tool box instead of this set."
5,Great gift,"We bought this as a Christmas present for my boyfriends nephew. He loved it and started playing immediately. It has a great variety, which allowed him to build using several different tools. Would recommend!"
4,Fun toy for little carpenters,Fun toy. I bought this toy for my 5 year old son. He had seen it at a friend's house and enjoyed playing with it. He can screw pegs into a piece with holes and enjoys pretending to fix things.
5,My son is a big boy now,"Whenever there is anything that needs fixing, 3-year-old Aaron runs and gets his toolbox. He loves it! He loves the little fake piece of wood that comes in it, and he practices screwing and nailing into it. A cool toy that they will not get tired of once it is not a new toy. When Daddy is working in the garage, Aaron gets his tool box so that he can ""help"". SO CUTE! Learning to be a little man. People commented that the box is flimsy. Well, it's not Rubbermaid or anything, but it's fine. It's held up for us for 2 months so far..."
3,Mr Darcy drives a COBRA!!!!,"This was really a terrible, but entertaining version of my favorite Jane Austen book. I watch all of the versions that come out through the years and this one was by far the worst. It still however, was quite entertaining if you just did not take it seriously. Mr. Darcy's initial behavior was not pulled off to the point that it would be forgivable and he just came off looking like a jerk, unlike Colin Firth's ability to pull off anything!!! His only redeeming quality was that he drove a gorgeous black Cobra, but you only get to see it for a short time.I love the fact that the spin on Wickham was a problem with multiple wives - perfect considering the title: Pride and Prejudice - A LATTER DAY ......Entertaining, but could never replace Colin Firth's version... rent it for a sick day and you are sure to be entertained."
4,Cute movie...,"I liked this movie pretty much-it's a pretty faithful take on the actual novel. I do think a Mormon cultural setting is actually an excellent way to spring P&P into a modern context, because really, Mormon young adults tend to think about marrying alot earlier than most other folks for moral and religious reasons. The main problem I had with the movie was that it had a tendency to swipe some key scenes from other Jane Austen flicks-ie, P&Pw/Colin Firth, Mansfield Park, Bridget Jones Diary. Other than that, it's a nice, clean cut movie that your kids can watch with you without having to tell them to turn around or cover their ears every moment like most other romantic comedies. My boys actually really liked this when they watched it."
2,GARBAGE,absolute and utter rubbish. ABSOLUTE AND UTTER RUBBISH!!!!!Content of story = terribleActing = Joke!!Waste of life = completely
1,A Really Bad Movie!!!,This is a horrible movie! One of the worst films I have ever seen. The cover art is the only quality thing about this product.
3,Low-key but nice,"When I checked this one out from my local library I wasn't expecting much. It looks like something that was either broadcast on TV or just went straight to video. But I was surprised at its light-hearted take on the Austen novel. This version certainly isn't a classic, but it made for a fun chick-flick-movie-night for me. I appreciated the film makers' choice to not inject alot of unnecessary sex or bad language into the movie. It's a good story as it is. The acting isn't Oscar-worthy, but the script is elevated by its principal actors, Kam Heskin (Elizabeth)and Orlando Seale (Darcy). Orlando's a highly trained actor, and it really shines through in his performance.There are lots of extras on the DVD. I especially like the pop-up track that pays lots of tribute to Jane Austen's novel, comparing certain details (both obvious and somewhat hidden details) to the original tale.So even though I give this only 3 stars, I still recommend it and hope others discover this movie, too."
2,Bad variation on P&P; skip it!,"One of the worst variations on Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The main problem is that Darcy is so unlikable, rude, arrogant and even mean in the first part, that he is completely unredeemable. A hero who suggests to the owner of the bookshop where Elizabeth works that she is useless and he should fire her? And for no serious reason? Pray, what kind of hero is that? I'm sorry, I just don't find the notion of causing someone to lose his job for no serious offense as light or funny.Also, Colins was a sweet but half-witted man, nothing in comparison with Austen's Collins. The pace was slow, the heroes either uninteresting or bad (see above), so what is there to see? A complete waste of time."
2,disappointing,"While the rubber design fit my 4G 20GB very well, the screen was horrible. It is a thin plastic sheet which came scratched and fuzzy. When pressed against the iPod screen, air bubbles are trapped and the view of the display is very distorted. I would strongly recommend a case with a hard plastic screen over one like this."
1,The Lowest of the Low !,"Yes, this is it! About as low as one can possibly sink... An album of Pat Boone 'RE-Records'! I bought this CD for Pat's (uniquely caucasian) versions of 'Tutti Frutti', 'Ain't That A Shame' and 'Jambalaya'. Imagine my amazement when I slid the CD in and heard that they had actually gone to the expense and trouble of RE-RECORDING THEM ! UNBELIEVABLE! I can't imagine anyone who would want to buy this on purpose (unless you're running some type of detention center where they play absolutely horrible music to punish teen offenders--(for which this CD is ideally suited.. ). Stay away from this one..."
2,Beaker breaks too easily under normal use,"Love the product, but I have now broken two beakers by simply pouring hot water into the beaker. In both cases, they cracked (and then exploded) leaving a most interesting mess to clean up.Upon closer inspection of the beaker, it is clear that it is made with ZERO extra material and heft. This makes sense for the manufacturer from a materials and shipping standpoint, but it will certainly affect durability and value for the consumer.Now that I'm considering a THIRD replacement, I'm wondering what other options are available."
2,New glass for clumsy guy,"I love the coffee that the Bodum Coffee Press makes, but unfortunatley, I must be a little clumsy in the kitchen, 'cause I dropped mine in the sink and it broke. The replacement from Amazon is authentic Bodum, not a knock-off, and works perfectly."
3,It's fragile,"OK, you sneeze and they break. Only reason I bought another was because they keep breaking. Wanting French Press coffee this creates something of a deal with the devil. I suggest buying a press AND a replacement right away.Now, if Bodum wanted to do something NICE, they could create a plexiglass beaker that fits the rest of the parts. Of course, then they couldn't keep selling replacements."
3,Cheaper in town and can't use Prime,"I was about to order this item when I thought to call our local coffee store and low and behold the thing is three dollars cheaper. Beyond that I can't use Prime for shipping.I have only been able to use Prime for about a third of my purchases on Amazon.com, what a waste of money. I would encourage others to not pay for Prime because so few items seem to end up being eligible.The Bodum products are all great, I only gave this 3 stars due to the above."
2,Kali,"This is a harsh dye, it left the sick pink. I have used other Kali dye with no problems. I had to stop using it."
4,You may as well get the Dolphy Prestige box =),"I'll start by saying that this is not the issue of Straight Ahead that I own. I have this as part of the Eric Dolphy Complete Prestige box-set that I reviewed here however many years ago, which was remastered more recently than this issue. So, my review is just on the performance and the quality of the album, not the sound.I love this album! It will always stand in the shadow of Blues & the Abstract Truth because unlike Abstract, this album isn't packed full of as many of the big names in jazz, but don't let that fool you. This is also a classic album.There are times here where Dolphy swings like a demented circus performer, and Nelson is (as usual), dripping with blues and soul. The tunes are great and the performances milk every last drop of loveliness out of them. This is one of those albums where I tend to think that no jazz collection could be considered complete without it."
1,Boring... Don't waste your money or your time,"I purchased this cd inspired by the song 'Breathe', hoping that the rest of the titles would follow suit. Not.... At.... All! They are boring, droning, tired, unoriginal, and annoying. And I am usually not this critical of music. I am puzzled how such a nice song as 'Breathe' can end up on such a dead end album. If you are interested in buying this because of that song, save your money and buy the single/maxi-single. I've learned my lesson, the next time I am influenced by a commercial to buy a cd, I will listen to a few more songs before I do so."
1,"Very, very bad","This is, without a doubt, the worst CD I have purchased in the last 5 years. Like many others, I bought the CD after hearing ""Breathe"", which ended up being the only decent song on the entire CD. The sampling here is ridiculous and makes no sense whatsoever. On most of the songs, it seems as if they are sampling just for the sake of sampling, and most of it just seems forced, out of place, etc. There is really nothing original on this CD either. Everything on here has been done before, only 10 times better. This CD also has the distinction of containing the two worst songs i've ever heard, da hoola and let's go again. I honestly have no idea how an artist could put these songs on a CD and actually think anyone would enjoy them. It is disappointing that the CD is so bad considering ""Breathe"" is such a great single. You would think there would be at least one other good song on it."
2,Inconsistent quality.,"The Kraftwerk-style tracks are great. But the rap track is just awful. Why put such a different genre in with such wonderful electronic music? It just doesn't work together, and it's a bad track."
2,This CD is nothing special,"Sure, this CD has a cool looking jacket, but that's about it. Like many folks, my main interest in buying this CD was for ""Breathe"". Of course though, the souped-up version of the song from the TV commercial is much better. Not only that, but this CD has two different versions of ""Breathe"", which IMHO was done purely to fill up space on this CD. And unless there was something wrong with my particular CD, Track 10 appears to have 2-3 minutes of completely dead air at the end of it. What's THAT all about? Other than the pretty good ""Breathe"" track on this CD, the rest of the songs are just ""OK"". I'm sorry I bought into this... I much prefer one of my other recent purchases, LoveBox by Groove Armada. That CD rocks!"
3,"Fun, decorative, entertaining.","The album's first single (and track) hooked me and thrilled me from the moment I heard it on the radio but after listening to the whole album, I was rather disappointed. Nothing on it equals the single even though it features quite a few nice moments. The band goes from one style to another so it's very hard to really get hooked throughout the album, from one end to the other. Listening to 'Genetic World' reminded me of Bran Van 3000's work. For fans of funky, varied and decorative alternative music."
1,Bad product; Non existing customer service,"I bought this product from Amazon in February 2007, and have since regretted my purchase. To begin with, I could not get the product to work. I could see that packets were being sent and received but I could not get to the internet. Over a period of 3 days, I called up customer service around 12 times. Every time, I had to wait 10 minutes and then had to leave a message. However, I never got a call back. I finally called up AT&T; and the technician there helped me navigate the product even though this is not one of the products they support.I finally did get the modem working, but once every few days, it stopped working and I had to reboot the modem everytime. After 6 weeks of suffering through the product, I have decided to return the product for a refund. Based upon my experience, I would not advise anyone to buy this product."
2,Not for a home bartender...,"I downloaded this quick and dirty guide hoping to find simple recipes I could make with the 15 or so bottles of liquor we inherited when my fiance's parents moved across the country. There are very few recipes that call for simple liquors such as rum, vodka, whiskey, etc. They use name brands instead of naming the type of liquor as well. I would not recommend this as your quick, go-to guide unless you have literally a full bar with full array of garnishes, bitters, etc. to work from.Then again, I guess you get what you pay for at less than $1."
3,Heart Pendant Watch,"The only problem i had with this watch was that the door wouldn't stay shut. I fixed it by bending it slightly so the latch would be tighter rather than send it back, and that seems to be working..."
3,"pretty and worth the price, but...","It's pretty, but the face is a bit small. Even with a 24"" chain, it's a struggle to see the time without glasses (and I only use 1.0 power). I'm trying to decide whether I buy a longer chain or a different pendant altogether. I also find the watch a bit hard to open since it's so small. And the chain on the pendant is really pretty, but it grabs the fine hairs on the back of my neck--really quite the deal breaker for me since it makes it uncomfortable to wear plus difficult to view. But it really does look nice."
2,"Pretty, but not well made","I got this watch as a gift for my mother. It is very attractive, and the chain was just the right length for her to be able to check the time while wearing the watch.Unfortunately after only a week of wear parts began falling off. She was able to replace them the first several times it happened, but eventually one was dropped and lost and the watch was no longer wearable.We were disappointed since it really was quite pretty and very functional. I suppose it wasn't very expensive to begin with, but she had hoped to have it more than a week before it broke!"
2,Its Aight...................,"I wouldnt exactly call this classic Rza. And I would have given it 2 1/2 stars but I gave it 2 so I could knock down the high rating it has. Dont get me wrong, some of the tracks are real good but about 1/4 are so-so and another 1/4 are kinda whack but not totally whack. If your die hard wu tang then check it out cuz there are definatly some good tracks. But it dosent deserve 4-5 stars in my book when it compared to other albums"
4,Wall Bar,I purchased only 1 of the wall bar to see what it will look like. I was pleased with the construction & looks that I'm going to order 3 more when I get my tax returns for next year.
5,She is unbelievable,"Neko Case is one of the greatest sounding singers I've ever heard. I was a little disappointed that this DVD was recorded before Fox Confessor Brings the Flood because I was looking forward to hearing a bunch of those tracks, but Outro With Bees on this recording more than makes up for any disappointment. She is totally unreal!"
3,Died after 4 months,Seemed to be a good battery but last Monday would not work after charging...will by a more expensive brand next time.
5,Soldier Love Story,Absolutely love it and Johnny Messner is adorable. It is such a perfect love story showing how two people can make it work.
4,cute movie,"Cute movie, makes me wonder what happens next to them. Maybe time to think of a follow on (sequel) to it. thanks for asking. bac 8-11-10"
5,academicboundmom,"I love romance whether in a book or a movie and this movie is exellent. The plot is excellent, the characters are real, and the story is clean. I could see this story happening in real life. This is also an excellent family movie. Hallmark did an excellent job promoting this movie on the Hallmark movie channel. I watched this on this channel and immediatly went on amazon after to purchase this movie. Everyone enjoy!"
4,I think we can all relate to this stuff,"I love Nora Roberts!!!!!! and this book was a triple treat. Anyone who has family that has set them up on dates, will relate to this. Only these stories have all the ingredients--energy, attraction, intelligence and love.--Hope there is more cousin out there ."
2,A little corny...,"This was the first Nora Roberts novel I've read and most likely the last. It started off strong and interesting. However, I found the characters to be non-believable. They were portrayed as too perfect and ideal for real life. The author doesn't give each character time to develop. Therefore, in each of the trilogies, there is an abrupt transition from when the couples first meet each other to when they end up together. The simple plots and unrealistic characters insult the readers intelligence. Also, I don't think there was enough variety in the vocabulary. Certain words such as ""tug"" and ""good stock"" were used over and over, to the reader's annoyance. A good editor might have picked up on these."
4,Charming--er--that all,"""The MacGregor Brides"" is a charming ""story"" of love and happily-ever-after ending. I like the MacGregor character. The rest of them are right-down too flat. The only MacGregor cousin that is a better devolped and real is Julia. Only her relationship seem to be natural. It's OK if you like people falling in love after they have intercourse. Is that real love?"
5,Can't miss with this family.,"I have read all of her MacGregor books more than once. They are stories that you can't help but enjoy. Even though these girls came from big money, they all got an education and went out to work like ""ordinary"" people. Have to respect them for that. All have a happy ending, but isn't that what we all want out of life."
4,Nice,"If you are a fan of drum 'n' bass, this is a must have! I must warn you though. It is more in the soft genre of drum 'n' bass. I would call it a mixture of soulful beats with a nice blend of drum 'n' bass. It could also be categorized as a kind of acid jazz meets Vikter Duplaix meets drum 'n' bass. A modern blend of ol' time acid jazz with an input of the sound of Vikter Duplaix and the drum 'n' bass rhytms. I would recommend this to anyone. Real nice release!"
1,Pale imitation of the previous Body for Life,"She tries to cover so many topics that at the end her book is nothing more than a big collection of well-known advice. The major withdrawal is the cold and not motivating tone of the provided information. There isn't a clear, step-by-step program for weight loss. Instead you can find some many rules and general advice. The photos in the book are taken from the previous Body for Life and this is enough to show that Dr. Peeke practically does NOT HAVE photos with successful before and after transformations due to only her version of Body for Life. This is too much boosted book in the media, which obviously fails to deliver up to the expectations of its readers."
2,Too many excuses not to do it!,"I ordered both the original Body for Life (which I love) and this other ""for Women"" version when I was deciding to make a change in my life. While the original is short, succinct and very well organized, the ""for women"" version is too long, too involved and seems to list tons of reasons why women won't be able to succeed at this plan! This is one time when simple is best - man or woman, go with the original Body for Life instead of this knockoff that tells us we'll never really look that good and probably won't get through the program because we're too emotional, but all that's ok because WE ARE WOMEN. It's poopy!"
3,Good Positive Book,"I bought this book for my sister, she read it in just a couple days. She said it was good, but not life altering as the reviews made it sound! My sister is 22, the book seemed to be geared more towards mid-life adults, so some of the lessons didn't really apply to her, and some did."
4,Body for Life for Women: A Woman's Plan for Physical and Mental Transformation,"Finally, a plan designed for the needs of women. I have only been on the plan for 3 weeks (of 12) and I can already attest to the fact that this is a plan I can stick to. Whether you want to lose weight, or maintain a healthy weight/lifestyle, this plan offers a realistic approach to the needs of women (including ""chill outs"" that leave wiggle room for chocolate). You get what you put in - no whining allowed. Realistic without deprevation. Includes ""real"" food and portion guidelines."
3,Too strict for me...,"This plan is just too restrictive for me personally, other wise I think the plan is a great idea!"
2,Too general and holistic,"General, holistic yes, but not and specific and practical for the busy and obese women nowadays. I found that the ""program"" from the book is too demanding and requires A LOT of efforts. With all the extra weight I have on me it is quite difficult and even dangerous to make all these cardio and fitness exercises. It is obvious that the book is written from a Doctor. The style is quite high and often difficult to understand. I expected more different approach and content, which is really reader friendly. Unfortunately, I have to keep searching for better book."
2,"I'll stick to the ""Body for Life"" Program","When I bought this book, I was expecting the Body for Life program with some added information for women and more photos of transformations to inspire me. The transformations in the book appear to be women who actually did the original ""Body for Life"" program -- not this one. The diet plan lacked the simplicity of the original Body for Life plan. The book overall was also less inspiring than the original. If you're looking for a diet program that really works (I've lost 25 lbs and am still losing) I would recommend sticking with the original Body for Life book written by Bill Phillips. If you want more information, there is also Eating for Life and the Body for Life Success Journal which are much better sources for continued reading."
1,What a disappointment!,"I got this book expecting updated information, women specific, for the same great program that was in the original book. What I ended up with was a bunch of advice that basically allows women to continue to take it slow, make excuses and put off getting their butts up off of the couch. None of the women featured in the pictures followed this watered-down approach. They ALL got those fabulous results with the original Body for LIFE program by Bill Phillips. Save the money you'd spend on this, quit making excuses and jump in with both feet on the original program. Skip this hooey altogether, if you truly want that awe-inspiring body you've been dreaming of!"
5,Perfect,"This is by far one of Bobby's loveliest efforts.It would be a nice soundtrack for life, I think."
3,?,"I would love to review this book but I ordered it, paid for it and never received it. Please contact me. Thank you! Cara Fareri"
3,Most UnBelievable Voice - But Stretched too Thin,"First of all, I think Dax is the best new thing out. His lyrics wipe out everyone else on the planet out of the water and his new album is great. Some songs sound forced and I can hear the influences of the songs more than the originality. The drums sound way too much like Agents of the Oblivion. Just riding the floor tom and bass is just not going to cut it. Deadboy drumming was simple and time-keeping but it forced out the voice and guitar and melody and made it special. True fans will love the new album but your not gonna reach anyone new with a dated band sound."
4,JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED!,"This mount is very simple to install. The instructions were a little off as to which letter equaled what part but I used common sense and everything worked out fine. The mount is very sturdy and fit my 50"" Philips plasma perfectly. The price,($158.95),including shipping was a great deal compared to $249.99 that Circuit city was charging for this same exact mount. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the screw up with the instructions, as per quality it ROCKS!"
5,Fits like a 'T',"I bought this mount for my Philips 37"" (37PF7320A/37) LCD TV. I think it is an overkill for my TV, since it weighs about 70 lbs. Also, the VESA mount is 400x800. This mount is about the only one that fits my TV. Quite easy to install as well."
1,this phone is junque,"My mother-in-law owns one of these phones. As she said, ""fix my phone. The phone went out and now its just a machine. I want you to fix it.""The same problem that everyone else has been having on this list -- with the answering machine going dead and the voice saying ""memory is full -- we've got that problem, too.The way to fix it is to unplug the phone for a few minutes. Then the phone's original message will be restored.Do that and your mother-in-law will really like you."
3,"Good, but lacking","The HD941 has a brilliant picture when upconverting, but has a problem with HDMI audio. I've got it hooked up to a Samsung DLP (HL-R4557W) HDTV and although the picture is about as good as you can possibly get, audio through the HDMI cable is nonexistant. ""HDMI audio not supported"" flashes on the screen when trying to play a DVD using digital audio. PCM audio works fine, but that's a waste since 5.1 is the only way to listen to audio. The firmware upgrade didn't work for me and Samsung support was a joke. After contacting them four times and getting four answers with no fixes, I gave up. I run the optical output on the DVD player into my amplifier and that works fine. I shouldn't have to, but that's just the way it is."
4,good at everything=master of nothing,"If you have a HDTV Monitor then an upconvert DVD player is a good idea.But if you have Hdtv with an internal scaler for say a LCD rear projector/Dlp i dont know if youll see a big difference.Also i read a test report on this player that the SACD outputs only at 16 bit not 24bit.Which is a drag because i bought this as a back up SACD player.Oh Well, Still a nice universal player for the price."
3,SAMSUNG DVD HD-941 FACTORY DEFECT,"I PURCHASED A SAMSUNG DVD HD-941 FROM J&R MUSIC WORLD IN FEBRUARY FOR AROUND $300 AFTER HOOKING UP THE HDMI CORD (SUPPLIED) TO A SHARP AQUOS 32in LCD TV. THE PICTURE WAS GREAT BUT THE AUDIO POPPED CLICKED, AND DROPPED OUT EVERY FEW SECONDS. THE TV ONSCREEN MESSAGE SAID HDMI AUDIO NOT SUPPORTED. I RETURNED THE PLAYER TO J&R AND IN TEN DAYS RECEIVED A NEW REPLACEMENT UNIT. UNPACKED IT,SET IT UP, AND THE SAME PROBLEM OCCURED AGAIN. I CALLED SAMSUNG TECH SERVICE AND THEY ADMITTED THAT SOME UNITS HAD A PROBABLE SOFTWARE PROBLEM IN SOME UNITS AND THAT THEY WERE WORKING ON IT. I RETURNED THE PLAYER AGAIN AND WILL GET MY CARD REFUNDED. I WILL LOOK FOR A DIFFERENT PLAYER. SONY S975V MOST LIKELY."
2,Hitler Movie,It isn't really well done but does let you see what a monster he was. I would recomend this film to you if you want to see the monster do his thing and her his voice.
5,Aries Spears Look Hollywood I'm Smiling,"I love this man. Hands down, this is one of the funniest stand up routines I have ever seen. I can hardly wait to see what he does next."
4,Useful for the amateur to intermediate,"Although not quite a good reference work for the true professional, The Encyclopedia of Snakes covers a wide array of topics and goes through the classification of the snakes in a comprehensible family by family format. The quality of the photographs is quite excellent, and, coupled with the extensive tidbits on habits, anatomy, classification, and range makes a wonderful and compelling read."
5,"Oh, my .. I really forgot to review this great item?","Yep, I mean it (the title :) I have an oval shaped slow cooker, and it was impossible, or nearly, to find a grate/grill for it .. you know, so the meat you're so carefully slow-cooking doesn't re-suck-up the very fat, grease and gook you're trying to keep away from it <smile>.I've had it a couple of months now, and well, the non-stick surface is great, the handles are in the very spot they should be, that is under the glass lid (not too high), and easy to grab .. but they will be hot! so be careful.Other grill/grates I've seen were double the price or more. And, there were no handles.Me? I'm just a Sunday slow-cooker, with a hate-washing-dishes side that makes this a great .. grate :)"
5,Suave Skin Wash,I could not find this product any where. I find it on Amazon. It cost a to much but I got it anyway. It had be discountiuned but Amazon had it.
4,not too bad,This body wash has a pleasant scent. The problem is that it doesn't feel nice on the skin. The body wash feels like mucus.
4,"Love Body washes, gels, etc","Well i ordered a few items including this 1 body wash fragrance.was very nice...........gave some to grt nieces for Xmas gifts!Those that got at least 1 body splash, wash were very happyto get them.....use their mom's alot @ home!! She was delighted too. nice for yourself also......lovely fragrances, get someand feel refreshed!!"
2,not an inspirational work,"There are some ideas that might be useful to a new parent who has had no exposure to children. The ""insights"" provided by the author are more or less rehashed parenting stuff. The author writes at a high school level of prose. very much self-indulging. he talks alot about himself. It appears to be a vanity book - meant to promote his position amongst psychologists. You could learn more from ""Parenting isn't for Cowards"" by Dobson. And you might also be inspired by Dobson's view of life."
3,Stays new for a couple of hours,"We purchased this for my son's 3rd birthday. My son eat, sleeps, and breaths space ships he was so happy to open this gift. He played with it non stop for about 2 hours at which point the front door broke off. He still plays with it, but it now it the appearance of a dollar store toy."
2,cheap toy!,This toy is not made well. The plastic is cheap and falls apart easily. The little rubber space men are the best part of this package.
4,"""Spaceflight for dummies"" (not an insult!)","Tribble parlays his name into an entertaining, lightweight overview of the history of space exploration and the basics of spaceflight science and engineering. I didn't find it too enlightening, but someone with limited prior knowledge about the subject would likely find it helpful.I have my usual quibbles: Apollo 17 wasn't the first mission to depict the liftoff of the lunar module, just the most successful. And Tribble reports two ""urban legends"" as fact, one being the story that HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey was a deliberate one-upmanship on IBM (go back one letter in the alphabet for ""IBM"" to see what I mean), something Arthur C. Clarke denies. But as usual those are trivial. Overall, Tribble provides a clear, if basic, explanation of the key issues of space flight, and I didn't detect any errors in the core of his presentation.Recommended for those looking for a basic introduction to space flight."
2,Only good for vacations,"This thing worked fine but it runs through a whole battery in two days. Only use it if you plan to use it for a vacation. Also, I recommend testing it before you use it to make sure it opens. It worked for us but the mechanism is poor."
5,Great Dish,"This is the only piece of Sango Splash stoneware I own. I bought to try out the pattern before I bought the entire set and it is one of my favorite dishes. I love the shape and it is sturdy. My kids clean the kitchen and are always chipping a dish, but this one has held up beautifully. I always serve asparagus or a zuchinni salad in it. I am planning on purchasing the entire set soon."
1,Not serious but not funny. Flat characters.,"I've liked a couple short stories by this author quite a bit but I couldn't finish this book (I did get more than halfway through by forcing myself).Most stories are either serious or funny and this story was neither. I found the characters very uninteresting, especially the main character who seems to have some sense of honor but could just be called ""Generic Witless Good Guy With Special Powers He Has No Idea How To Use"".The final thing that stopped me reading the book was the bad pun on the family names of :Locke, Bolte, Seale, and Keye.I would say if you're looking for a serious ghost story or story about the supernatural, DO NOT read this book. If you're looking for a funny ghost story DO NOT read this book. Actually I'm not sure why anyone would want to read this tepid, urban fantasy."
2,Shallow and sometimes has poor understanding of scripture,"After previewing several of the devotions, I decided that I would not use this devotional with my family (sophomore and senior). In my opinion, the writing style and applications would be appropriate for pre-teen up to junior high.Worse yet, I thought the understanding/interpretation of scripture in some of the devotions was weak or just simply incorrect. The author seemed to have a point that she wanted to make, and tried to force the scripture to match her desired point."
1,Buy a Litter Champ instead,"I've had two of these--each time hoping for better luck in using it. The plastic cylinderwraps around a plastic circle and if the plastic isn't put in just exactly right, thebag twists, gets stuck, and worse breaks. Never in using the two items did I have anexperience removing the plastic cylinder that it didn't break apart when replacing the unitWhat a revolting mess. The unit itself is flimsy. The Litter Champ is much more direct--no twising of the plastic, so no breaking and the plastic is much sturdier--cleaner, moreefficient, no odor due to breakage--an all-around better product."
1,Poorly made and designed,"I bought this to replace the litter locker II I was using. Nothing wrong with the previous version, just thought the new one would be an improvement on the older one. Wow, was I wrong. This version is made of very cheap and flimsy materials. I could barely get it to stay together when I first assembled it. The spindle idea is moronic. It's hard to turn and wastes a lot of the bag. Plus I noticed the company has gone back to the older version with their newest offering, the litter genie. Unbelievable. Luckily I kept the litter locker II and will go back to using that."
1,Total junk!,"I picked up one of these at Petco. when I pulled it out of the box, the tumbler was already off the track, and once I secured it, it popped off again WITHOUT any littler in it! I tried using it and it came off the track again, with the handles popping inside the container all the time. I took it back for a replacement, but after looking at the other litter mate, I decided to just get a refund. The other was the same way. Absolute junk!"
4,No more plastic megalo-mart bags!,"I bought the LitterLocker Plus last month as a trial-run because if it didn't work, I was going to send it back. The refill already came with so I didn't buy anything extra. The refill (with 2 cats) lasted about 3 weeks. I decided that I couldn't shell out that kind of money for a refill, so I took the empty refill to Wal-Mart and matched it up with a Diaper Genie refill from the kid's section and they are ALMOST a perfect match AND they are under $5.00. I use the white ones.So, I think it's a good buy if you are tired of using plastic bags to scoop you kitty's litter and it really helps that you can use Diaper Genie refills."
4,Color? They'll send what ever they want!,"Requested blue, they sent a ""new color-dirty gold/metallic."" Sent email after email no response. So if you don't mind them picking the color for youthen go for it. X-Mass present for someone else, hope they don't mind gold! Product not in use yet, I hope it holds up like everyonesays.12.11.10I just heard back from Pet Co.! I received an email explaining they were having system issues and thus the lack of response. A very nice and sincere apology for my inconvenience. The company has made a quick and timely effort to correct the issue. We can all appreciate a quick resolution to an issue. Thank-you Manette!1.20.11This product is excellent! Keeps odors locked in. Easy to operate, no problems with installing or removing the bag."
3,Good except the turning mechanism is a hassle and sometimes the bags break,"We have two of these units and two Litter Champs (purchased the Litter Champs May 2009)Litter Locker was a god send when it came out. Now we love the Litter Champ because it solves two major issues the Litter Locker had -- the turning mechanism was awkward, heavy and secondly the bags occasionally get torn when removing from the wheel -- resulting in a spill inside the unit or on the floor. Big HASSLE to clean. My husband even has a challenge with the turning handle -- we're both young and strong so it has nothing to do with age -- just with design.Controls odors great. 99% control and the Litter Champ is about 95%.Ease of use = 70% Litter Champ 100%Bags lasting long = 80% Litter Champ seems to be twice as long as the Litter Locker!(no turning required of the bags therefore more use of the bags in the Litter Champ)If you can only afford one -- get the Litter Champ. The bags last longer and it's 100 times easier to operate."
4,Makes clean up so much easier,I purchased this from a pet store and couldn't get the handle to turn. In frustration I returned it for a refund. Then I decided to foster 3 kittens which are pooping machines and found I had to clean the litterbox 3-4 times a day. So I decided to try this again and I'm very happy. It makes the the clean up so much easier.
3,LitterLocker,"All-in-all, it's a great concept especially for apartment dwelling; however, it doesn't totally lock in the odor. I find that I need to also use doggie bags (& I don't even have a dog), & as another LitterLocker user suggested, drop in disinfectant wipes or spray for the clean up to be bearable. Altho every 2-week disposal is the ""required"" according to the box, I do week cleaning. I don't regret getting this product, yet I do think it can be improved to put truth to the ""Absolutely no more odor"" description. Are these bags biodegradable? Hmmmm....is it possible to do that with biodegradable products? Thank you for this opportunity."
5,Classic Belew,"Yes, I must agree this is a high point in Belew's long career. This is classic Belew in every sense of the word. Belew's guitar work is masterful and creative. He is in a league of his own and way ahead of his time.I like every track from beginning to end on this album. My favorite tracks, though, are ""Walk Around The World"" and ""Under The Radar"", Belew provides an excellent lead vocal on these two songs. I also like ""Elephants"", which makes me think back to his work with Tom Tom Club, primarily the song ""L'Elephant"".The album in it's entirety is a work of art and a great listen all the way through.Thank you Adrian Belew for another wonderful work."
2,disappointed,"Disappointed.What else do you need to know?What else can I say?One song on the whole record grabbed me.One other song grabbed me for a moment or two, and then lost me.The rest was musical & sonic self-abuse.Adrian, I love you, and I always have.I probably always will.But I don't get this.Did you feel some need to out-do Robert Fripp in the 'irritate everyone in the name of elitist guitar snobbery' department?Maybe after the 23rd or 24th listen it'll hit me, and I'll declare this your latest act of musical genius.But I doubt it.Side Two did absolutely nothing for me either.I am totally stymied, sir."
5,Good step-by-step recipe book for lean implementation,This book provides a practical approach for implementing lean manufacturing and what pit-falls should be avoided during the lean journey. Recommended for organizations that are beginning lean manaufacturing implementation.
1,elrucco,"i was taken. the packaging had printed on it ""not for sale"". the freight charges should be investigated."
1,Is anything considered sacred anymore??,"From the opening paragraph throughtout this entire book, basicpremises of the Bible and the sacred beliefs of millions of Christians are assaulted. Omnipotent God is portrayed as forgetful, purposeless, inept and clueless about managing what he has created. Indeed, God attempts suicide only to rise out of the muck(promoting evolution rather than Creationism). Ferrucci's God decides not to hang around at the Nativity because he isn't sure he's the father. Further idiocy has Jesus getting drunk before the Crucifixion and flinging the cup at God. Most reviews have found this book entertaining. My Bible says, ""How can men be wise? The only way to begin is by reverence for God. For growth and wisdom comes from obeying his laws"".Psalms 111:10. This work is totally irreverant, blasphemous and discounts the power and wrath of Holy GOD."
1,Was that really necessary???,"To quote Chandler from a ""Friends"" episode: ""That was one of the worst things ever..."". I have to admit that this CD reminded me quite a little bit of William Shatner's musical outings. Shatner also can't sing but at least he is funny. Majandra's CD just comes of as boring and pretentious. I think she tries to emulate the likes of Alanis Morrisette, Bjork or Tori Amos. Sadly, she fails. I hope she sticks to acting. She is cute as ""Roswell's"" Maria deLuca."
4,just great background music,"Outstanding, up-to-date background music, with just a touch of lesbian chick. A great collection, and it furthers the cause!"
4,Its great if you like this style of music,I liked this album alot because sometimes I like music thats a bit softer and melodic like Coldplay. Truthfully you shouldn't really consider this traditional rock at all. If you judge it by that standard you'll probably hate it. This album isn't about that in the least. The songs are catchy and enjoyable to listen to. It's music I listen to when I want to chill just as I did with Coldplay. Sorry if it disapoints the hardcore rock crowd but this isn't hard rock in any sense of the term. So please judge it accordingly. If you don't like it thats fine theres plenty of music to choose from that you may like. As always try to listen to more then one track before you buy. Enjoy music.Cheers
2,"umm, no.","Gary, Gary Gary...where did you go wrong? What happened to the days when you used to write good songs? I bought this CD before hearing it, having been a fan of past Snow Patrol and the Reindeer Section (Gary's other band). The song titles snapped me up right away - though these really great song titles give no indication of poignant or thoughful lyrics in the songs. This CD might contain worse lyrics than a Hillary Duff CD. I kid you not, and I quote ""Maybe I can do it if I put my back into it""...why would anyone want to rip off Ice Cube of all people? I admit the songs on this CD are well crafted catchy pop tunes, but it severely lacks substance. The song structure is the same of every song, and it took me about five seconds to lift ""Run"". It's uninteresting, unexciting. They were horrendous live - backup vocals incredibly off key, and for the most part it was as if someone had just cranked the CD over the Opera House's PA...Now go buy some Wilco."
3,Pete Yorn?,"I think there are plenty people out here that listen to this CD that are going to hate me for saying this but I will say it anyway... Pete Yorn does it better. Sure the lyrics are good but honestly the music is not interesting. As I have said before, I listen to all my music the whole way through first, then I get into the song Individually. This albumn was boring at parts, and unimaginative in others. However it is worth buying. Most consumers now are buying Britany, and Ludacris, this album is definitely worth the cash."
4,Terrific Band,"I recently saw Snow patrol open for Coldplay in nashville, then I purchased tickets for their show @ the legendary Ryman Auditorioum in Oct.I will match Lightbody's vocal abilities with any rock singer. Snow patrol is a mature creative band that is terrific live."
2,Not impressed!,"Im sorry for all fans but I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried but the songs wouldnt just stick to me, escept for 'Run' which is definitely one of the best songs of the year, and their first track whatchamacallit. They're missing something, and I cant seem to know what it is.Still, I will be following up on their next album in case that hits."
3,Sebadoh pt. II - the meek shall inherit the airplay,"An excellent reinterpretation of ""Bakesale"" - era Sebadoh (esp. their singles ""Spitting Games"" and ""Chocolate"" and ""Wow""). I give three stars for general competence. A record titled ""Baksale pt. II"" would be cool, but this entry lacks the passion that leant that 1994 record its conviction. If these guys are Irish, why do they get their inspiration from California? Only if they are too meek to invent a distinctive sound."
3,bi-polar,"This album is almost bi-polar. There are a few amazing songs that have flown to the top of my ""favorites"" playlist, and several mediocre ones that I generally skip. I'd give it a 3 1/2 if I could, because the good ones are GREAt, and the rest are not at the same caliber. Listen to How to be Dead, Chocolate, and Run, but the rest are fairly skippable. Still is a good buy. It's worth it for 10 dollars."
4,Snappy tune--really cool,"This song is wacky, funny, and most of all cool. Abercrombie and Fitch--ROCK ON!"
1,AWFUL!!!,"This song is one of the worst I have ever heard. I wish there was a no-star rating...that is what this really bad song deserves. The lyrics don't even make sense! One part of the chorus is ""New Kids on the Block had a bunch of hits/Chinese food makes me sick""...what is that? The words are just thrown together for the purpose of rhyming, with no regard to their meaning at all. The tune isn't even good. It's just plain STUPID!"
1,Piece of Garbage!,"This failed attempt of a song plays like a commercial for Abercombie&Fitch. Where should I start. The awful singing, the repetitive lyrics, the weak rap, and lame rhymes (fitch and Rich). How long did it take him to figure that one out. Even Hanson have richer voices then these guys. Is the singer 10 or something. Anyway, just plain bad. AVOID PLAYING THE SONG TO SUMMER GIRLS. Youll get a slap in the face."
1,"Well, this song sure is... uh... Something?","Honestly, it's not that bad of a song, unless you're actually listening to it. It's got a catchy beat, and lyrics that catch your attention... but once you've heard it twice, you've really laughed enough for one song... Anyone else wondering what the next one hit something or other will be? Seriously..."
5,I love the song summer girls,Hey what's up this is Tweety here I am 13 and I love the song summer girls by lfo it is so good I can never get tired of that song it is so good if you have never heard it you sure are missing out cause it is a great song will I am interested in different grops like N sync Backstreet boys and many more...Of course summer girls well if you are interested in writing me to be like a penpal then feel free to write me if you are aboy or a girl I'm not picky but I would like you to be the ages of 12-17.
1,listening to this will lower your IQ,what the hell kind of song is this? it makes no sense. a&f? new kids? chinese food? ok...whatever... someone needs to drag whoever wrote this song in the middle of the street and put him out of his misery.plus those 3 freaks...who are they? lfo?

4,"Love the blades, hate the dispenser","I've been using these blades for several months now, and have come to love the blades for their sharpness and durability. They really need to work on that dispenser, though. Every time I need a new blade, it takes a good 5 minutes and a lot of naughty language to get the new blade out of the dispenser. Still, it's the only blade I use."
4,Good Starter Bow for Adults,"This one was for me 'cause I'm a lefty.Just like the right-hand model it comes pre-nocked with arrow rest and standard mounts for sights & other accessories. It is ready for the archery range out of the box. The draw weight is strong enough to go 20 yards with aluminum arrows. However, I would not push it out beyond that distance, especially with heavier carbon fiber arrows.The only drawback is that I wish it had a little more draw weight. Maybe 25 to 30 LBS so that it can go a little further. Overall it is an excellent bow for the beginner."
4,Charming Christmastime Movie,I really enjoyed this movie. I first watched it in the 80's and then in 1995 I saw it in my local public library. Every year for the next seven years at Christmas time I took it home to view again. Shirley Jones does an excellent job. The New England countryside is beautiful and the lodge where the story takes place is charming.
5,The clinical and scientific basis of Myalgic Encephalitis,Unbelievably insightfull to those who have or are sufferingfrom this devestating disease process .Every treating physicianshould have this in there office.In my personal observationswith some people I have met and also myself and my wife it isdefinetly and as a matter of medical fact a potential lifesaver.The fact that this author Dr. Byron Hyde has went to extremelenghts to study research and organise the world symposiumon this to gather varied medical research and facts from allthese brilliant minds tells me that this man deserves at thevery least a medal of Honour but rather the Nobel Peace Prizefor devoting at least 25 years of his life to studying andcaring enough to try and find the cause and cure of so muchhuman suffering that exists in our world. My sincerest regards...P.S. I passed on the book to another fellow sufferer and neverreally got the chance to read very much but my doctor has one now.
4,I found good informations on it.,"For all Mustang lovers.At this manual I founded informations about my Mustang II, Guia 1974, that with then I`m starting one deep restoration process at Electrical system.Weak point:No information about the original collors.Thanks.Serrano-Brazil+5504188006474"
1,"you mean to tell me, that i have to buy the book first?","how the hell do i know if the information this book is what i want? what if this book only gives me the information i already know? meaning, it will only give half of the information, but not enough to finish the job."
5,Horton Crossbow Rail Lube,Horton Crossbow Rail Lube is a great lubricant for the rails of your crossbow to extend the life of your bow string. It is simple to put on and lasts a pretty long time.
4,Good Learning Guide,"If you are totally lost and do not know where to start when studying for 229, this book is a good place to start. However, there are many holes in the book that you need to be aware of. Supplement this with reading of BOL or taking the Transcenders. If you rely totally on this book, you would be in for a shock in the exam. It covers at best 80% of the material."
4,Better then my dell,"I was having trouble deciding between this and my IBM thinkpad. Both were about the same height and weight but the Averatec has more bells and whistles and is about $1200 cheaper.I am VERY HAPPY with the system so far. Works great out of the box and battery lasts for a little over 2 hours when I am working on it. It lasts longer if you are just watching a DVD.Small, Light, Quiet, and packed with features. Its worth it for this price."
4,GF Pleased,"For being small.. it does the job quite well. Vibrations are good on the darker side. Kinda hard to open (bend it in the middle), but after a while you get the hang of it. Wish it had multiple speeds.. but still is a good purchase. Recommended."
5,Couldn't wait to fight!,"If you like personal narratives of life in front line combat, you should read ""The Fool Lieutenant,"" the story of Bob Edlin vs the Germany Army. I have read a dozen or more, but this one is something special. In the first place, this guy really had some adventures - some funny some hair-raising. One reason it's special to me is that I served with Bob for 18 months in the 112th Regiment. But he was in a hurry to get into combat and so he volunteered for the Rangers - and became a legend. I hope you read this excellent account of Bob's story, told in his special straight-talking style, and I hope he sells a million copies. Anybody who would turn down the Medal of Honor (because if he accepted it, he would have to leave his Ranger comrades and return to the States) deserves to have his story known after all these years.He also tells of his life before and after the war, which adds interest to his combat story."
1,Paranoid blood libel - Constitutionally protected hate speech,"I found this book in Malaysia, a Muslim country where moderate Muslims are trying to reconcile their beliefs with the actions of Islamic fascists. The author is a suck-up and cipher to former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir. Chock full of inflammatory libels and lies, this book, a latter-day Protocols of the Elders of Zion, only serves to show how the United States Constitution's First Amendment protects hate speech. If you want to see how low an author can go, buy this book."
4,Can't complain,"It's my first flash drive, so I've no basis to compare it to others. But as a means to escape burning countless cd's in order to transport information between work and home, it's been a godsend. The thing seems bullet proof. My only complaints really aren't complaints about the drive itself. 1. It's almost too small; I'm constantly losing it among the pens in my bag. 2. I was a little surprised to find that some system administrators block the use of memory devices like this drive, where they don't block burned cd's."
4,Works great!,This thing is very fast and works exactly as advertised. I'd buy it again. The only minor issue I have with it is that the cap should be easier to take off.
3,Shoe horn fell out immediately,I bought this for the dressing hooks and wide round foam handle. Which has been wonderful. I did not need the shoe horn. But when I went to use it the shoe horn fell out every time. Instead of gluing it in I tossed it. But the dressing hooks are the best!! The rubber tipped one does not slide off of clothing and that is a significant plus.
5,Quick and to the point,"This book isn't very long, but it offers some interesting counterpoints to traditional theology. It exposes readers to a subject that's not spoken of in our culture. A great read if your looking for something new to think about. I also recommend Terence McKenna's ""Food of the Gods""."
1,Big brother censorship,I have written critically of this book two times before and both have been erased from Amazons website. So much for freedom of expression. This book is not worth the paper its printed on and it is dangerous because the author indirectly promotes the use of a mushroom that can cause toxic liver failure. Otherwise its poorly written garbage for the national enquirer crowd.
1,Too dim,"I bought these candles to decorate my house for the Holidays. I was extremely disappointed. The light is sooo dim you can barely see them from the outside of the house. Unfortunately since I bought 22, it would have cost me too much to send them back."
2,bright orange light,"These candles are fine except they are not white or soft yellow light, they are bright orange, yuk, not right for Holiday decorating. These candles made me think of halloween, not Christmas."
5,It explains nearly everything,"This book is brilliant. Its perspective on time, matter, the universe, our lives, and aliens is all interesting and clear. What's funny about Francis Crick is that he's insanely clear while insanely deep and intelligent. He comes up with great metaphors for complex and abstract thoughts that make them simple and fun to read. This book will blow your mind and make you think. I am not totally sold on this book's wisdom, but it sure beats the religious takes on how we got here. ""And god said, 'Let there be Crick!'"""
3,"Good, but not up to Gonick's usual art standards","The Cartoon History of the United States is well written and interesting. However, it was a decided disappointment in comparison to his Cartoon History of the Universe comics or his strips in Discover magazine. If all you're looking for is a populist slanted history of the United States, read Zinn's or some other more comprehensive work. If your looking for lots of high quality cartooning, go for a different Gonick book. The art here is less detailed and doesn't carry a substory as much as other works. However, if you're just looking for easy to swallow history, by all means get this book--it's only bad by contrast."
2,A People's Cartoon History of the United States,"This book should have been titled ""A People's Cartoon History of the United States"". Very similar in view and distortion to Zinn's people's history, but much more enjoyable because of Gonick's art and humor. I've never seen anything else that makes history so accessible. Too bad he had to present such a one-sided view. I can't in good conscience recommend this book to impressionable youngsters who haven't been exposed to more balanced materials."
5,Perfect Copy!,Product was exactly as described and delivered promptly! Couldn't ask for a better seller!
5,adjustable V-Rack,"I couldn't find a product locally for use on the grill, so I checked on Amazon and found exactly what I needed. Thanks!"
3,"Works great for hair, but experienced adverse effects","I used this product for about 2 months, and wow what a roller coaster ride. Immediately my hair thickened up and felt healthier, but I started to shed much more than usual. The amount I shed in the shower doubled for about a month and a half, and then finally it slowed down. Once that was resolved, I started developing ringing in the ears, which led to hearing loss. I emailed the company asking about this, and they said they never heard of that happening. I am still worried about my hearing, and I regret using for so long because it did help with hair health and itch. I read about another reviewer who got headaches, and I may have experienced a similar allergic reaction."
2,Too much,"280 pages, chock full of average photographs. Thirty pages cover history and influences; 40 pages of introduction to Glaswegians, their pubs, football, arts, and music; 130 pages go into way more detail about Glasgow than you want to know. Too much information for a local or a visitor. This book should have been cut in half and shared with Edinburgh."
4,An excellent rendering of Bach!,"The playing of Hewitt is very lively and highly expressive. The way she handles the counterpoint is quite fluent and subtle,with the essence of Bach's music well preserved. Though I wouldn't suggest this CD to a novice in Bach's music,I feel that many who are already familiar with and fond of Bach will come upon something new in Hewitt's performance as in some other excellent interpretaions of Bach's piano music."
3,"Her best yet, combined with great piano sound.","Angela is getting her Bach keyboard act more together with his record. Her previous tries with the Partitas and WTC I have been so-so, with a wonderful Chromatic Fantasia as the top performance. Now, she comes up with a very nice WTC II, much in the elastic style of Andras Schiff, although not as exhilarating as Glenn Gould. If something can be criticized, it is her way of playing it safe. Very even rhythms and few surprises - which in turn can make her record a bit boring at times. Perhaps not a success with GG hard core fans, for that she plays to carefully and slowly, but a good introduction to those that want to take a first plunge into the wonderful preludes & fugues. Great sound!"
1,Definately do your homework on this one,"I bought the bean just before I had my first baby thinking it would be great to have in the hospital. Boy was I wrong. I brought it home and tried to install the software onto my computer. The program kept canceling the installation process and when I went online to get the so called patch it did nothing to help me. NONE of the music that I had PAID for and downloaded onto my computer were compatable with the SonicStage. I became very frustrated and deleted the whole thing off my computer and returned it. When I went to return it the lady told me that it sounded like I got a corrupt disc, which I bought her story and exchanged it for a new bean. Same thing happened, I couldn't get the program to complete the installation process and took the whole thing back AGAIN to Target. Definately a waste of my time. The player looks cute and is nice in your hand but definately not worth the hassle it has with it. Don't waste your time in my opinion."
2,WAV recording and high battery consumption,"This was not exactly what I was looking for the following reasons:1. Only records in WAV format. I don't know if this is an exclusively IPOD OS feature but two hours of recording uses 1.5GB (Too much in my concern)2. It consumes the full IPOD battery in less than 2.5 hours and the worst part is that this device has not choice to plug any charger the IPOD simultaneously.3. It has to be very (when I say very is very very) close to the source in order to capture a good record.4. When the device is attached to the IPOD you have to be very careful because is too easy to disconnect.In other words need a better design to fix the power consumption problem, the recording sensibility/format and the ""attachability"" to the IPOD"
1,"Not so much the Steamvac problem, but UPS","I received this item in poor condition. I was hesitant to buying online, but threw caution to the wind and tried it anyway. When it arrived, the box was opened on the top and a massive hole on the side. It was missing two bottles of fluid, and two parts to the Steamvac itself.I must say though, I did my research and will be buying this item in Charlotte, NC if I can find it in a store. I vow to never buy online again."
4,A WORK FIT FOR THE LARGE OR SMALL SCREEN,"I MUST ADMIT, I ENJOYED THIS BOOK. IT HAD ME GUESSING ALL THE WAY TO THE END. THE DESCRIPTION WAS JUST A LITTLE, TEENY, TINY, BIT WORDY, BUT IT WAS VERY NECESSARY TO THE STORY TO PICTURE NEW YORK AND HARLEM DURING THAT TIME OF THE CENTURY. IT SHOWS DETERRENCE AND HARDSHIPS THAT DIVIDED A PEOPLE BASED ON SOMETHING SIMPLE AS THE SHADE OF SKIN COLOR. DETAIL WAS IMPECCCABLE, AND THE STORYLINE WONDERFUL. I CAN EASILY SEE THIS STORY AS A FULL-FEATURE MOVIE, OR AN HBO OR SHOWTIME ORIGINAL. MISS WALKER, MY HAT OFF TO YOU, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO MORE, AND EVEN MORE IN THE FUTURE. DEFINITELY AN EYE-OPENER IN MORE WAYS THAN JUST A WHODUNIT."
4,UNCUT IS CUT,"You may want to get the 2 fullscreen dvd volumes as this set is unfortunately given the fake widescreen treatment. This means that it's the fullscreen version with the top and bottom blacked out to appear as if this was given a widescreen release. It never was. It's pretty obvious at parts that the tops of people's heads are cut off as well as at the bottom. Sad sad sad.Defintely a good series, though there is no ending. Still worth watching. If you like Astro Boy, you'll enjoy this. What a great idea to take an old manga and give it modern animation."
5,Should be renamed: Web Designer's Handbook,"This is honestly a book that I take with me everywhere with design in mind. I have about 5 or 6 CSS/XHTML books and honestly this is still the first one I reach for. The author's a well-edited (no errors), his examples are carbon-copy from his site, and he covers all the basics in this book in English. If you want to finally quit reinventing the wheel and learn how to apply standards that are re-shaping the web, this is the book. Nuff said, thanks Craig."
4,"For the apprentice, not the beginner","This books, in my opinion, is definitely not for the newcomer. If you've never done web design, this book is going to be overwhelming for you. It touches on a lot of topics.If you're a web designer or many years or even a relatively new one with a few simple web sites and a good beginner's book, this is a very good book. It's like learning from a master but as an apprentice. The master doesn't exactly spoonfeed you with information but lays it out on the table and expects you to pick up the spoon and scoop away the knowledge.I'd say you definitely should read this book if you're aiming to be a proper, high-class, professional web designer/developer. However, if you're brand new, then this book deserves to wait a bit."
2,Fooled Again!!,"Once again, it's a REPRINT of Nora's books.......only these are from 1982, 1987 and 1992. Come on, 20 years??? Nowhere in any of the editorial reviews is that little fact mentioned. I love ya, Amazon, but from now on, if there's a doubt about the publication date, I'm going to buy my books at the bookstore, where I can hold them in my hand, open the front cover and check the original publication date. I've been fooled too many times! Oh--if you care, these stories are just that--silly formula stories that Nora should have kept on the shelf."
3,Interesting set of stories.,"Well actually I would give it 3 1/2 stars only because of one of the stories I could not warm up to. The first story was excellent,Vaness and Brady Tucker were easy to like characters I gave it 4 stars. The second one with Lainie and Dillon only 2,why, because they were not easy to like characters. I had a difficult time warming up to them, and also a complete reversal to the first story. The final story Mind over Matter was to me the best of the three I can see an early begining to her witch series and the Donavon Series. All an all a better group of stories than her last Dangerous series. I still think that she is great and you should give this book a try."
4,Pleasing!,"My boyfriend was very pleased with this for Christmas. It arrived within 4 days of me placing the order, which was remarkable for the holiday season. The only complaint I do have is that the cutter is one piece of steel simple curved at the handle. A hollow handle would have been more ideal and what I would have loved to give. For the price and delivery speed, this is a wonderful bargain and item."
3,CUTTER FOR MEDIUM-SIZED PIZZAS,"WELL DESIGNED, STAINLESS STEEL, ""ROCKER"" CUTTER.NICE SHARP CONVEX EDGE. GOOD FEEL ON THE ROLLED HANDLE.EXPECT THIS KNIFE TO LAST QUITE AWHILE.A BETTER DESIGN WOULD HAVE BEEN TO HAVE A LONGER BLADE AND/OR HANDLES ON EACH END;FOR BETTER PRESSURE CONTROL AND GREATER CUTTING LENGTH.HAVE SEEN THE ABOVE SUGGESTIONS INCORPORATED IN MORE PRICEY MODELS."
2,Looks better than it works ...,"This is a decent sized pizza cutter, and I liked the all stainless design. Unfortunately it is very thin, and the curve is a bit too flat making a rocking cut more difficult. We have had a much better experience with another rocking pizza cutter also sold by Amazon. I found the handle less comfortable to apply force on than expected. While thin, this cutter seems durable, just it didn't cut as well as another cutter we tried. If you are on a budget and need to cut costs, this is an improvement over the round cutters many use for pizza's."
4,Cuts like a champ,Great clean cutter and simple design. We were surprised at how large it was in real life and how much room it takes up in the dishwasher... but you can argue with the results!
4,Good value for the money,"If you have limited funds, this is a good vacuum for the money. I bought this vacuum recently and have used it on hardwood floors and short pile rugs with no problems. It easily suctions up dirt. It only has a 12-inch width....but that works better for me than the wider 15-inch ones since it gets between chair legs and into tight spaces. My complaints? It's a bit heavy...and NOISY! (the loudest vacuum I've ever used). And the quality of the parts isn't as good as vacuums that cost two or three times more, but since I only paid 89.95 for it, I feel I got more than my money's worth. And at that price I'm more than willing to overlook the noise and weight."
3,TOO HEAVY,"The vacuum itself does a good job, but being a woman with a small frame, I found it too heavy to push back and forth. I suggest you only purchase this item if you are REALLY STRONG!!"
2,Disappointed,It doesn't get cold enough to keep food fresh for very long. I am now looking for a better brand of mini frig. I gave it two stars only because it's very lightweight and maintenance free.
1,Not inexpensive when all is considered,""" was designes to operate at approximately 20-25 {degrees} below room (ambient) temperature when set at maximum settings."" Quote owners manual page 6. {yes its mis-spelled there }Bought unit 11/12/07 it stopped cooling May 08. Its warmer inside then room temperature.Attempted to contact company. No response to email after 10 days, called the company. After 10:48 minutes on hold my call was answered. After I ship them `certified mail' a bunch of items costing me $5.00-7.00 and send them a check for $15.00 shipping charge, they will send me a replacement unit.I did ask the rep to wave the shipping cost, since the company is replacing the unit after they found out model #. No further questions were asked. They said no and I posted this review.SO for the cost of a larger refrigerator and not counting all of the hassle I have been through. I now have a working cooler and luke-warm soda. This 'replacement unit' will be on craig's list as soon as it gets to my home."
3,"nice, but take care","I order from Amazon all the time. I needed these chairs for extra seating in my kitchen. Saw these, price was great and they are similar to what I already had. They came with good packing and in a timely manner, but one chair must have been defective because the first time an adult (under 200 lbs) sat on it, she crashed to the floor. One of the legs had split near the seat. Other chair is fine. So, test carefully before you use!!Winsome Wood Windsor Chair, Natural, Set of 2"
4,As Advertised - and Free Shipping!,"I ordered two pairs of these chairs to replace similar ones bought years ago from IKEA. These are sturdier and look really nice. Arrive promptly and completely undamaged - one pair came by FedEx, arrived a day earlier than the other by UPS. Am thinking of buying a few more to replace chairs in the dining room, now.Four stars because I haven't had them long enough to be sure they'll last forever...."
3,Nice solid chairs,I ordered 4 (2 sets of 2) chairs that arrived quickly. The wood has minor flaws but finish is smooth. The workmanship is excellent and the chairs are nice and sturdy. The overall quality is much better than I expected for the price.
4,No assembly required !,"These are nice chairs. I needed chairs quickly, but as it was not a planned purchase,my budget limited. Not fine dining but attractive and sturdy for my needs. Middle of the road in comfort but I think chair pads will remedy. They arrived promptly, well packaged and put together. It seems as if writing coherent assembly instructions is a dying art. A big plus was being able to unpack and good to go.Good value for the price."
1,product displayed is different from the one received,"The chairs I received are very different from the ones displayed in the product picture.The product picture shows the chair has a darker color and the wooden rods on the back are round. The chair sent has flat rods on the back and the wood is much lighter. Also the seat shown is round/oval, the one I received has a accented design on the sides.The product picture is a misrepresentation, I am not satisfied.All attempts to contact the seller after receiving the product have received no response.Additionally the packaging for the screws that came along with the chairs was torn and tape sealed. It seems like this seller is selling refurbished items, stay away."
5,Sturdy kitchen chairs with stress-free shipping,"We ordered this product, because it matched our 4 dining room chairs and we recently purchased a larger table that sat 6. The chairs matched in color and quality. We especially enjoyed the price of the product and the free shipping. The chairs arrived promptly and were packed extremely carefully to avoid damage during transport. I was concerned about shipping furniture, but found that the completely assembled product arrived without any incident directly to my door. Now we have a complete set to our table and you would never know we didn't purchase all 6 together or from different stores in different years."
1,Not Worth Your Money - Pass on This,"This humidifier was a great disappointment. It would not work right out of the box. By not work, I mean it would not power on. I took it back to the store and got another one from a different store. This time, the unit powered on but the humistat did not work after three days - it showed the humidity in my house was 90%!!!! An absolutely worthless product. I only gave it one star because I couldn't rate it lower than that!"
1,"Worked for a while, then broke","I bought 2 of these at the same time. They worked well for a few years, then the electronic system suddenly broke. Both of them. Unfixable, and ultimately a waste of money."
4,Hard to find but worth the search,"I wanted to buy the HWM-260 that was highly rated by CONSUMER REPORTS but couldn't find that model anywhere. This model lacks the unnecessary remote but otherwise is the same design. The user manual covers both models. Unit was $40 at HOME DEPOT. Simple to use, easy to clean and reassemble; no filters to worry about! Also, very quiet even on higher setting. So far, so good..."
1,A wonderful piece of broken junk,"We loved our humidifier for the first 2 months, in spite of its flawed humidity sensor and slightly confusing operation. We took great care to maintain and clean the unit EXACTLY as directed, and one day, upon starting the machine, grey, acrid smoke started coming from the vent, and the electronic display went blank. It shorted out with no warning and no abuse on our part. The failure of the electronic component meant the machine was inoperable. It won't turn on at all. We attempted to return it, but were informed that WE had broken the unit. Flawed machine. Great if you like throwing money away."
1,don't bother,The humidistat didn't work at all. Seems like other folks have had the same problem. I would pass on this model.
3,May be a great unit if you wnat to run only for a few hours.,The whole tank gets emptied in 6-7 hours in a low setting. This is a very big drawback.
1,Waste of money,"The first one I received stopped working after 5 days. I tried cleaning the heating element, etc but the machine would not produce warm mist. The replacement I received from Amazon would not even turn on!!! No lights lit up or anything. Needless to say, I am seeking a refund!"
2,Hard Water? Run Away!,"I used this model for two winters. While it does the job it's supposed to do pretty well, it is IMPOSSIBLE to get the hard water scale off the heating element, despite regular cleanings. I've tried chipping it away with a screwdriver, and soaking it in vinegar for a couple of days. Truly, impossible.I must have gotten a little too vigorous in my attempts, because the unit doesn't work anymore. I'm shopping for a new one that has replaceable filters to collect the hard water deposits.Pros: Not too loud, hygrometer works, adjustable settings are nice.Cons: Mineral buildup, hard to clean, small tank."
1,Stop working after one winter,"Worked for one winter. And this year after using it twice it stopped working. Right now it can't be turned on and once it's plugged in the digital display just blinks. Called www.kaz.com and I have to pay $30 to cover the cost for shipping to have it fixed.By the way, my friend got the same unit a week after I got mine.Her unit is acting the same way now....Does that mean they have really good 'Quality Control' ??"
2,Great until it stopped working,"I've had two of these units now, and both of them quit after about 4 months for no reason I can figure out. You should use distilled water, or you'll find yourself taking the thing apart and cleaning the mineral build-up off every couple of weeks or so. While it was working though, it was pretty good. I'd recommend a humidifier with manual controls instead of digital, as that was what first stopped working."
2,Poor Quality,"Just purchased unit 2 days ago, right out of the box the humidistat started at 30% which was correct but once I set it to high it jumped to a reading of 60% in about 2 minutes does not work properly when set on high level it seems to pickup the humidity from the unit instead of ambient humidity, on low level it works well but not enough output for larger rooms.If I use it without the humidistat on high it increased the humidity too much and I have to remember to shut it off manually or I get condensation everywhere from too much humidity. Called support and they said to return it.. unit is defective.As others have said, these units work well.. when they are working but be prepared for poor quality issues if you get one."
2,It won't work after one/two weeks,"I saw other reviews that this unit has problem after few weeks.It won't power on later, I thought it won't happen to me.I took the chance, but bought it from a local store.If it had problem, I could exchange it.And it happened! It won't power on after I just used two weeks.This is a great unit if it works. If I were you, I would buy it from a local store :-)"
2,Lacks Longevity,"I bought this vacuum cleaner 3 years ago to the month and unfortunately, now I have to purchase another one. I should have gotten the extended warranty offered at time of sale but I expected it to last at least 5 years. The on and off power switch was giving some problems, until about 4 months ago it finally stopped working. Once its on it stays on despite sliding switch to the off position. I tried to repair it myself from an online help instruction, but that failed. It worked once but then the problem resumed. Also,the bag indicator still remains a mystery to me. I am a hoover fan as it cleans well,but very disappointed on this ones longevity."
1,Hoover WinTunnel Supreme - not so supreme,"This vacuum is absolutely junk. It won't pick up anything, not even a small piece of paper. If it's something small and solid, it just beats it around and never sucks it up. I have a Rainbow that I had planned to use occasionally and use the Hoover as my regular vacuum, but it looks like I'll be dragging the Rainbow out and hauling the Hoover to the garbage."
4,Great for flash cards!,"I'm a preschool teacher, and am actually cutting up this book (I bought two of them because the pages are obviously two-sided!) to use as flash cards. The one thing I really dislike, however, is the use of English along with the French. I really don't think that's the best way to learn a foreign language, but the pictures are great!"
2,nice idea but the advice is not good and is repetitive,"This was fun to read for a while and it is often interesting when she gives developmental information. Where this breaks down is when she starts giving parenting advice. A lot of it's pretty outdated and frankly bad. Not that I was using this for parenting guidance or anything, but I found myself skipping over lots of sections. It also gets very repetetive after a while - the same things are repeated over and over in slightly different ways.You'd be much better off with either a real journal if you want to take lots of notes (this has very little writing space and is really just a book) or get a good baby book for recording milestones and memories. You can get better developmental info on the web anyway - sites like babycenter.com send you weekly newsletters the first year that are better than what you find in this book."
4,Toothbrush Sanitizer does the job,ensures using a clean toothbrush when travelling and at home. This is the second one I have purchased since the light went out on the first one. The only thing that would have made it better would be if you could replace the ultraviolet light.
2,lost,"I haven't recieved this product, and checked with my leasing office stuff, no one see it, it might be lost, I wonder if you can resend it, thanks"
2,OK let's believe in the tooth fairy,"I purchased two of these tooth sanitizers. One worked, the other never turned off after 7 minutes, 20 minutes, 12 hours. I could only assume whatever sanitizing needed to be done, was done in 7 minutes on my toothbrush, but my wife's toothbrush needed some serious sanitizing, because hers never turned off. Made me wonder where her mouth has been that this unit never stopped sanitizing.I did believe this sanitizing crap was doing its thing. But I can't help but believe in fairies and Santa Claus.Basically on review of the two products I purcased, one works I suppose, the other is defective! I didn't get any flu or viruses but can we assume it was a disinfective tooth brush that saved me or was it the zinc tablets, airborne tablets, sauerkraut, garlic, vitamin c or the zillion times I washed my hands."
4,WHO'S AFRAID AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF meets FOREST GUMP,"Adapting from his play, Charles Evered wrote and directed this sometimes-whimsical, mostly intense drama about a sophisticated, artsy, argumentative NY couple (Bebe Neuwirth, Peter Coyote) who invite a lonely sailor (Ethan Peck) for dinner. This film, a festival favorite, is the best of old school filmmaking in which the spoken words really matter.Much of the production, though set in NY, was shot in Palm Springs.Young Peck is astonishing in his sweet-natured optimism and his confident stillness. Dressed in crisp whites, it's easy to see him as an angel. In fact, some viewers are certain this was intended, but Evered is evasive.Evered is a significant new writer/director to watch. Look for his latest film, A THOUSAND CUTS."
5,Excellent book! My son (13) recommended it to me.,"My son read it in a few hours and said I had to read it. I did and found that I not only enjoyed it, but learned a great deal. I just read another person's review here on Amazon.com and she stated that it was a predictable junior romance. She missed the whole point of the book! This book has a very loose premise of a romantic story (perfectly okay for kids), but is really about a game teaching them about the different classes in society. I highly recommend the book, as does my son. He intends to recommend it to his English teacher this fall for a possible class assignment. Read it! You will definitely enjoy it and it'll make you think twice."
4,A good value and great cleaner,"Just bought this vacuum and proceeded to clean my whole house. I can't believe how much it picked up - especially dog fur. It's easy to empty the bagless chamber, and the vacuum cleans up to the edge of the vacuum on baseboards. Really works well.The only downside is that the onboard tools don't extend very far from the vacuum - I would like an add-on hose to allow you to clean more than 4 feet from the vacuum. Otherwise, it's great!I was concerned about the pushing weight since it's not self-propelled, but it wasn't a problem for me at all.If you want a good, basic vacuum that's easy to put together and use, but has the bagless feature, I recommend this unit.NOTE: added 1 year later - we go through a belt about every 6 months or so. If you start to smell burning and it's not picking up well, it's time for a new belt. Fortunately, they're inexpensive and easy to replace."
2,Save Yourself!!!,"Today the vacuum cleaner started smelling of burnt rubber. I discovered the belt was broken. After reading the reviews below I guess this will be a common problem. The bagless design is a terrible mess when it comes to emptying the chamber. My wife makes me put on a dust mask prior to emptying it and then I have to shower to remove the dust residue.In summary I would not buy this vacuum cleaner, stick to bagged models and SAVE YOURSELF!!!!"
3,Not so bad and not so good....,"I have been using this vacuum for about 4 years. Not much trouble with it. I replaced the belt once. Prabably I was lucky reviewing others complaints about the flimsy belt. Here are some good things and bad things about this vacuum based on my experience.Pros: Powerful suction. Washable filter. Durable.Cons: Heavy. Messy when emptying the dust chamber.So, I think it is a right one for you if you don't want to spend money on dust bags or filters and don't care about the weight."
4,Bagless Wonder,"I recently received one of these vacumes and having used bagless vacumes before, I was quite pleased with the ease in which this vacume can be cleaned. I agree with some of the reviews on the belt issue. I have had to change this one already. The belts seem to break easily if you go over objects as big as crayon pieces or coins but then it is not a shop vac! As for the amount of dirt that it picks up it is great! It really cleans down deep as evidenced by the amount of dirt in the container. Yes it is dusty but removing the container and taking it to the garage is a minor inconvienance when you figure you're not having to buy bags all the time. I would suggest having a few extra belts on hand though. As for the price, it is not the most expensive and well worth the money. Shop for the vacume that best fits your need. This is a good floor model and it's weight makes it hard to do stairs and carry around."
2,Content too old and incorrect,"I bought this book hoping to learn about basic principles of genetics in an easy-to-understand format. What I found was that the material was written many years ago. All you need to do is to check the copyright year. I knew that the one glaring error was the belief that there are 200,000 genes. We now know there are about 30,000. But it left me wondering what other information was outdated. Not wanting to learn incorrect information, I sent it back. If the authors update the content, then buy it because it's an enjoyable book."
1,Disappointed,When I purchased these CD's I didn't realize that the songs were not performed by the orginal artists. Both my husband and I were greatly disappointed in the CD's. The music and lyrics were just off. I don't recommend this at all.
5,The way complex subjects should be treated!,"Knowledgeable and complete explanation of importance and use of NT services. Every ""How"" has concise and understandable ""Why"". Chapter about NT security, general tips for multithreaded design, MSMQ, ..., a lot of extra staff. Elegant C++ classes for every aspect of NT service development - immediately reusable. Worth every penny you'll pay for this book."
3,"Pierrot /Castellani, a very short review","Concering the above review, ""this is the best Pierrot"" I disagree with. Its good, but not as good as the definitive, Jan Degaetani/still in print, recorded 1970.Another i prefer over this Sinopoli is the OOP, Pousseur/Herreweghe. That one has 1 listing at $50.Only worth it for collectors of great Pierrot's. Still I prefer the De Gaetani vs the Pousseur.Hope that helps.The Erwartung/with Alessandra Marc is ""less successful.3 Stars for this cd only."
2,Weak,"I remember being a kid and seeing this record in Sears and wanting it so much--the cover looked really neat, and I did like the Beatles and all the solo projects. Now, as an adult, I can say, whatta letdown from ""Band on the Run"". I would say there's only one keeper, ""Listen to What the Man Said"" (which is gorgeous and I think one of Paul's absolute best), and ""Letting Go"" is not bad. Sure, the album rocks, but original melodies are in short supply, and the lyrics are even less inspired than usual (and they took the trouble of printing them on the back sleeve!). There's the usual novelty stuff, with ""You Gave Me the Answer"" more music hall stuff, like ""When I'm Sixty-Four, and the ""Crossroads"" theme from a British soap opera...Beating a dead horse here, but one expects a certain amount of unevenness in Paul's albums; this one is more so than usual."
3,THE COMMERCIAL EFFICIENCY,"At that time, The ""Wings"" had a lot of success. ""Venus and Mars"" is not a great performance for the ex-beatle, who trust in the others members of the band. However, some songs are quite efficient, like ""Venus and Mars"" and ""Rock Show"", which were always sung in concerts, during the American Tour of 1976. Paul Mac Cartney seems to have sold his soul to the Devil. His next LP ""Wings at the speed of sound"" wasn't neither a great record. A little bit disappointing..."
4,Nearly Perfect,"I've always loved this CD, it catches Paul and company when they were in their prime, I give it only 4 stars because they proved on Band on the Run that they could do better."
4,"Good, but not Classic","After Paul's return to form on 1973's Band on the Run, Wings released this solid album...but it tends to sound like they were using too much of a formula. I like albums to have themes thoughout, but this seems a little forced. There are some great tunes here, but when I hear 'Call Me Back Again' I think it sounds like they were trying to re-create 'Let Me Roll It'. Then, the whole flow of the album is screwed up by the three mediocre bonus tracks that don't fit with the made up theme. Anyway, I hate to complain about good work, but it gets 5 stars for quality, but only 3 for originality."
2,Starts Off Great Then Goes....downhill,"Venus and Mars/Rock Show is a great way to start a record. Unfortunately, the balance of the recording does little to improve on the fast start. In fact, this record digresses from the intitial two songs.Venus and Mars began the three year slide into mediocrity for McCartney. He didn't get back to form until ""Back To The Egg."""
3,Some good and some bad.,"I'm a massive Beatles/Wings/McCartney fan, but for some reason this is an album that I'm not keen on. Don't ask me why, and I'll still give it 3 stars because it's got some good tracks. I like ""Venus & Mars"" (both versions), ""Rock Show"", ""Medicine Jar"" and ""Spirits of Ancient Egypt""; they're are all good. However I hate ""Love in song"" cause it's boring and ""Magneto and Titanium man"" is just annoying here! ""You gave me the answer"" sounds like an early Queen song and ""Call me back again"" is simply pointless! The rest; ""Letting Go"", ""Listen to what the man said"" and ""Lonely old people"" are ok, but just not very striking. It's not bad, however I hardly ever play it..."
3,"Light reading, some gaps in the story","I like James Hogan's work, but I don't think this book is one of his better efforts.The story has a good initial premise, providing the baseline of intelligent machines on a starship creating Taya from old (DNA) codes. Taya is a nine year old girl at the beginning of the story. I think it left out some obligatory developmental filler between the first section of the story when Taya is in self-discovery, and the next sub-story of planetfall with her younger cohorts. The way the mean and nasty king would revert to sugar and spice was too much of a reach for me.Another large gap in development to the next section which tied up the loose ends of the starship origins and meaning of life (for Taya). Throwing in a little mystical mumbo jumbo at the end along with a post-life meta-space just didn't flow well for me."
5,Beautiful,These earrings were very cheaply priced and I wasn't sure about the quality. When I recieved them I was surprised at how well they are made. Great for the price.
3,OVERALL FUNNY MOVIE,"For the most part, it's a funny movie. Yes, as usual, Eddie Murphy is all over the movie, but the scenes as Rasputia are the funniest. You really have to suspend reality when you think about a woman as beautiful as Thandie Newton finding Norbit even remotely attractive and interesting. But it's a movie! Some suggestiive stuff with Marlon Wayans character, but mostly kid-friendly. And some of the fat jokes and humor are excessive and probably unnecessary."
4,So funny,"I am an overweight person, and I laughed my butt off (I wish LOL)....I Had to to watch it over and over, because I missed lines.I was not offened like some others on here were."
1,Abuse is never funny,"This is a really poor attempt at trying to make a very hurtful and painful subject matter funny. It doesn't matter who is being abused and subjegated, male or female, there is nothing funny about this. Shame on you Eddie for being insensitive enough to even think something like this would be humorous."
1,TOTAL WASTE OF TIME,"By far the worse movie by Eddy Murphy I have watched. And I have seen many and always liked all of them.Ok, it's a different movie compared to the earlier ones he played in. But, that's not an excuse to make it a lousy one.The plot is OK. It's just the way each character is played that gives me doubts about what was Murphy thinking!?!?There were so many ways to play a ""dumb"" main role and they chose the most annoying one.It's difficult to follow the dialogs. It's hard to understand a single word pronounced by Rasputia (or whatever the name is) that is, the second main character played by Murphy.Don't waste your time and money!If you do still decide to buy this movie, be prepared for regretting your choice!!!"
3,Some Funny Moments,"This movie, with an all-star cast was fairly well-acted and has some genuinely funny moments. Norbit, played by Eddie Murphy, is a mild-mannered, kind of nerdy guy, who has been given some bad breaks in life.His wife, Rasputia, (also played by Murphy), is an enormous, vain, and extremely annoying diva wanna-be, who tries to control him. The plot is not as strong, nor the movie as funny as some of Murphy's other movies, but if you want some unsophisticated laughs and simple humor, it is worth it."
4,very funny movie,rented this movie very funny with eddie murphy one of his best roles ever plays multi. characters in this very good
3,Very Funny Movie,"Another funny movie from Eddie Murphy. It was dumb in parts, but overall it was good for some laughs. If you can get it on sale, great."
1,"""How you doing?"" Not good at all!","I was anticipating this movie. I had seen ""Dreamgirls"" and was thrilled with Eddie Murphy's performance. I had been hoping for an Eddie Murphy revival for sometime and thought ""Norbit"" would be the second installment.Well, this movie did not install correctly. The friend I went with was offended by many of the things this movie had to offer. The main thing to offend me was the ENTIRE thing because it was AWFUL.What made it A-W-F-U-L? It tried to hard. It included every comedy ingredient and multiplied it by 35. It was too much.I will add that it had some ""sneak me"" funny moments, but the film as a whole was not worth the paper my money was printed on."
4,Eddie Murphy is Hysterical,"Eddie Murphy playing his huge wife is hysterical. Especially, a scene at the water park. Buy it, kick back and enjoy a laugh."
1,Absolutely Horrible!!! Times 10x,"I went to see this movie on opening week and i was highly disappointed. How could u go from an outstanding Dreamgirls performance to this disaster? There were less than a handful of laughs and nearly demanded a refund. Eddie & Charlie Murphy should be ashame of themselves because this movie was a waste of film, time, production and everything else that goes into making a movie. Please spare the public a part 2. Good Riddens"
1,Wrong type of DVD ordered.,I didn't realize I ordered an HD DVD. I have to send it back to the seller.
3,Eddie is pretty good at multiple roles...,"Hey, you have to give Eddie Murphy some credit to be able to bring to lifeall these characters. Especially the patience to be hours after hours in the chair for the adding /removing of the makeup and fat suits. I enjoyed the movie, did laugh here and there and like most people i thaughtRasputia was a very mean selfish person, which made me root for Norbit.This is not one of Eddie's best movies, but it sure is not one of hisworse. This man has quite a talent for doing multiple characters..."
1,"Some moments, but mostly BAD!","I am a huge Eddie Murphy fan. For some reason, they are trying to turn him into Jerry Lewis. All he does these days is play all the roles now in his comedy movies. YAWN!!! Some of the characters he did well, but many were over the top and many you have seen before. Example - the typical old Jewish guy. Seen him in 3 other Eddie Murphy movies already!!! Can't the writers come up with new material???The emphasis and where they went wrong with this movie is simple - it all comes down to makeup and fat suits. No substance, all makeup.The script is lame, the jokes can be seen coming a mile away. It just doesn't work. The commercials/trailers show the best scenes and make it seem like it is hilarious. It isn't.It has some funny moments. Not enough to justify buying this. Maybe when it ends up in the $5 discount bin."
3,Some what funny,"Eddie Murphy can be funny at times, though I wonder about his habit of poking fun at characters that are in Norbit. Eddie try acting serious once in a while."
3,Norbit,"It was a cute movie, but I expect more from Eddie Murphy. He's a talented actor and can be a brilliant comedian! But he disappointed me with this poor black orphan, with a Jewish lisp(?) The story line was very cute, but Murphy could have done a much better job. I've seen what he is capable of and it is a lot better than what he did on this movie."
2,Blown Surprise,"I can't rate this product's performance as of yet...but a word of warning. If you plan on surprising someone with this product you better be waiting at the door for the UPS driver because they ship it in its original box. A nice big steam vac on the front.I ordered this for my wife as a surprise for Christmas. Well, when the doorbell rang the other evening and she raced to the door ahead of me low and behold there was the UPS driver standing next to her surprise. ""Merry Christmas honey,"" I said.At least I didn't have to wrap that big box. Thanks Target!"
4,Works well,"I got this after all of the awesome reviews. It does work very well. I don't think my carpets look brand new after using this cleaner, but they certainly look a heck of a lot better. The only thing that will make my carpets look new is, well, new carpets. With 2 dogs and a kid tracking mud and dirt into the house, this cleaner gets a good bit of use. I still hire a professional to come in once or twice a year to clean though. Amazon was wonderful, as always. Shipment was prompt."
1,shame shame shame,When I first used this machine I could not believe how well it worked. It took out stains that had been in my rug for a while! After using it a few times it stopped distributing water. Still under waranty we took it back to the store. We waited about 2 weeks to get it back and used it again. It seemed to work well again. After a few more times of using it I noticed that it is not sucking the water out of the carpet anymore. When I empty the tank it is still full of clean water and hardly any dirty water is around the bladder. Of course several of the plastic handles broke off just as stated in the other reviews. I am so furious at Bissel for ripping off its customers like that. This is NOT a cheap machine and there are obviously too many problems with the engineering of this product. This should almost be treated like factory defects with cars where they pay for all the costs associated with repairs because these are not isolated incidents!
4,Yea.. Clean Carpet,Easy to assemble. Easy to use. and best of all this cleaner got pet stains out of the carpets that the professional carpet cleaner did not.
4,A year old and still cleaning,"I purchased the Bissell 7920 over a year ago and I have no major complaints - it consistently performs well. It really cleans and restores my carpet; you can see this in the look of a refreshed carpet and in the dirty water in the tank. It saved my carpets while housetraing my puppy!The only thing that broke was the gauge that monitors your cleaning speed for optimal carpet cleaning performance. It was a nice feature, but really not necessary - the concept is the slower you move it the better it cleans.It is simple to use: you fill one tank with warm tap water and you fill the other with the cleaner.Hope this helps prospective buyers."
1,Bissell 7920 Proheat Sucks - and I don't mean Dirt!!!,"I purchased this machine beliveing that it would be the best carpet steam cleaner I could purchase. But I was dead WRONG! When I first used it, it worked like a dream and did a great job for the first 4 uses, after that all hell broke lose to include nuts and bolts. The machine has stopped working completely. Does not spray water, does not heat and handle lock has broken off. I wasted over $200.00 on this machine and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Bissell needs to recall this machine and take responsibility for their mistake. IF YOU ARE IN THE MARKET TO PURCHASE A CARPET CLEANER, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ONE!!! I was told by a vacume repairman of over 48 years that had seen his share of Bissells come through his shop - go with HOOVER instead, because (1) they have a much better track record and (2) they are much easier to find parts for."
2,"Works Great, until it broke","We read and followed all the instructions. It really does clean well, and leaves the carpets dry in about an hour. Everything is quite convenient. Considering we had just vacuumed with our super-duper vacuum cleaner, I was very surprised by how much ""stuff"" it seemed to leave on the floor. (The instructions said that might happen, and it did.) Our problem occurred within 15 minutes of use. The spinning brush broke away from its support and the pin and brush support bracket self destructed. The brush stopped spinning. And we returned the cleaner."
1,"LEMON, DONT BUY","Works great until it breaks and it will in short order. I have had it replaced 3 times and its in the shop now.If you just have to buy this product get the warantee. Treat it very gently, use Bissell's cleaners (other brands seem to disolve the glue used on seals), clean it meticulously after every use."
4,Good Product,"I have only had a chance to use this product a few times, but it does a very good job. I have berber carpet, two dogs, two cats, and an eight month old, this thing really get the dirt out of the carpet. The best part is that it doesnt leak and is very straightforward to use.The speed meter is more fluf than anything, you really dont need it. The seperate container for the water and cleaning solution is really nice. The bladder system for keeping the clean and dirty water seperate but in the same container is really quite novel, it looks odd but works well.If your in the market for one of these, it is definitely worth picking one up."
1,Worked Great until it broke!,"First a belt broke after about a dozen uses, which was only the beginning of troubles to come. Next, a little plastic piece that holds the roller on broke (I've replaced it several times). Finally the pump stopped working and it won't spay any cleaning solution. It's JUNK!!! Beware and stay far away from this product and this company. I've spent enough to have bought a high end cleaner."
1,"Short Life, Bad Purchase",Do your homework before you purchase a Bissell.I purchased this about 18 months ago. I owned it for about 6 months before I used it. I worked great and I loved it on the one room I cleaned. Now 12 months later I went to use it again to clean another room. Well no water would come out of the floor or the hose attachment. It is now in the shop getting an estimate to fix. The guy told me I should have purchased a Royal it is a much better machine. I have not purchased it yet because I'm still doing my homework. I can't find much on Royal either. But the design did look much better than the Bissell.
2,"Expensive, poorly engineered self destructing dissapointmnt","Read all the positive reveiws, they are correct. Works very well the first few times than self destructs. Roller brush bushings melt, attachment hose quits squirting detergent, soap dispenser stops dispensing, can't set soap mixture anymore, leaks all over the floor. I have repaired it numerous times and once it's apart you can see true Bissell engineering. What a plastic toy. I will not buy Bissell products after seeing the construction of this machine. A true lightweight with heavyweight price. Hey Bissell want your machine back? Come get it, It's out on the curb."
2,Cleans great IF you can get it to work,"I bought the Bissell 7920 ProHeat ProTech Carpet Cleaner two weeks ago, got a very quick delivery from Amazon.com, used the thing in one room and it quit working. No water is being pumped out of the ""tank-in-tank"" bladder. I was desperate to clean my carpets (5 animals) so I sprinkled water and solution from a bottle and used the machine for suction. Two hundred bucks toclean one room in my house. Does a great job when it works."
5,Great machine,"I've worked for a national carpet cleaning company, so I'm pretty knowledgeable about cleaning carpets. When you clean carpets you need heat to loosen the dirt and suction to get the dirt and water out of your carpet and pad. This machine uses the same concept that professionals use. We recently purchased a 10 year old home with filthy carpets, never been cleaned. We were going to have the carpets done professionally, but scheduling was difficult. We purchased this machine and it has already paid for itself. Easy to assemble, easy to use and our carpets were beautiful. I would suggest cleaning the carpets and then going over them again just to get any excess water out, no need to spray any solution on the carpet. We were very surprised at how well this machine cleaned the carpets and would recommend it to anyone."
2,Worked great until the parts started breaking,I agree with so many of these reviews. Works great WHEN it is working. First the lock that holds the head upright for easy carrying broke. Then the plastic bit that holds the brush in while you clean. And now finally a tiny piece of plastic inside the finger trigger which needs to be pressed to make it work. Really poor quality workmanship...which is a shame since I was hoping to have it and use it for many years.
5,Bohemain Rhapsody is the BEST song ever!,"I sent a list around to all of my friends and relatives. I had hundreds of votes for the song that everybody liked the best. Bohemian Rhapsody had about twenty more votes than any other song plus NOBODY checked the ""i don't like this song"" column. I was pleased with the results of my survey, seeing as how I love that song. It is really long, but it's awesome. From the slow, tearful ""mama *ooooooh* i don't wanna die, but if i'm not back before this time tomororow, carry on..."" to the upbeat ""valamoosh"" (i have no idea how to spell the sounds they make!) It's hard to pinpoint the power behind this song, but it is an incredibly wonderful song and this is a wonderful cd, and you HAVE to have this in your collection."
5,It expands the story BUT...,"Question Quest still gets five stars but if you are reading the Xanth books back-to-back this one is a bit repetitive. In all fairness to His Grace (Piers Anthony), fourteen years separate this book from the first in the series so he probably felt the need, at the time(1990), to refresh his audience with details from the earlier books. This book is kind of like a hamburger in that the bun represents the new story while the meat is a massive rehash of the first thirteen books. I love the new plot but it was burdensome reading a rehash of what I've been reading for the past few months. Of course, he wasn't writing this for folks like me who treat the story like one big book. He was helping people catch up with this mammoth world and its fascinating characters. I read a lot of good books in college and graduate school but NOTHING as fascinating or rewarding as the Xanth series (hence the five star review)."
4,Blackberry For Dummies,I am a newbee to Blackberrys. I found this book most helpful to learn many aspects of the operating system and to help installing programs. These were straight forward expanations.
1,expectations not met,virtually a total waste of time. Hard to source problem solving. Not easily executed for actions. The Index does not have enough subjects for the user. Not real simple and clear for actions. Would not recommend this product!
4,Recomended for those contemplating insemination,"I found the book fascinating, informative and cleverly written. I learned a lot from it and found that I wasn't alone in some of my pre-insemination craziness. There were even times when the book made me laugh out loud. While I found the book hard to put down, 3/4 of the way through it I got really tired of the author questioning the wisdon of lesbians getting pregnant. I felt like there was way too much internalized homophobia and I was just tired of it and wonder what the child will think when reading mom's book in the future. I also wish it didn't end so abruptly and spent more time on what would seemingly be the culmination of the book .. childbirth ... as well as the events with her mother surrounding the time of childbirth. Despite these two areas, I loved the book and highly recomend it."
2,Snarky Funny,"My partner and I bought this when we were starting to look at selecting a sperm donor, and were very disappointed in this book.We thought the author came across as neurotic and with a lot of internalized homophobia. And not in a way where you thought, ""Yes, but she's struggling to deal with it and there's some hope!"""
1,Seller is a liar and a cheat that wont take returns,I did not recieve the item pictured! seller would not refund me. seller was agressive and nasty. Instead i got a cheap chinese knock off
3,Powerfully pleasant,"Fans of upbeat jazz guitar would be well advised to check out this respected player, who offers a slippery technique on most takes but does not push past intense entertainment."
1,Intentionally depressing and unoriginal,"One year after graduating high school, a group of slackers hang out by a convenience store awaiting their ""rock star"" friend to return for a concert and a visit.This film makes the unoriginal argument that suburban life is sterile and its people live empty lives. To make sure you ""get it,"" the film opens and closes with tracking shots of strip malls and empty lots. Then, to make really sure that you ""get it,"" the film is underscored with angry, ominous music throughout.This film is intentionally depressing as we watch these ""no life"" characters arguing, destroying themselves with alchohol, and fuming with jealousy over their rock star friend.Why would anyone what to spend time with these characters, even for a visit?"
2,Expected more from Linklater...,"Definitely a disappointment. The story is just boring, and the charcters are based on stereotypes and are not likable. What happened to the visionary that created ""Slacker"" or the great storyteller who brought us the hillarious ""Dazed and Confused""? If you haven't seen those movies -- you should! This one you can pass by, unless you're really bored and want to see Parker posey and some very mediocre acting."
4,Made me laugh hard,"I watched this movie with my girlfriend and we had major laughing sessions. I recommend anyone who liked Clerks or Chasing Amy to rent this one. It is just as good as both of those. Be ""prepared"" for this one."
1,The Worst to come From AW,This is the poorest book to come out of Addison-Wesley Pub Co. It is simply not usable and a waste.
2,"Good Cleaner, Poor Customer service","With a young child and 2 indoor/outdoor dogs, I was really looking forward to clean carpets - 3 weeks later, I finally had them. The dirty water suction kept shutting off; the first time I didn't notice until the whole living room was wet. Tried to call customer service - the toll free number only provides recordings. To get a human required a toll call. Took 3 phone calls and a total of 35 minutes on hold to get through to an operator. At one point I left my pager number and was paged back to the hold queue. When I finally got through, the problem was a known issue and the fix was simple. I was then able to clean my carpets. The cleaner worked well, but the experience with customer service really soured my view."
5,Obscure Dexter,"Go figure: my local library has a copy of this, so I burned it. It's one of Dexter's least known efforts, but that doesn't make it less than stellar. I have never heard a bad Dexter album. This 1972 session came long before his celebrated New York ""comeback"" when he had a CBS recording contract for awhile and way before he earned a little fame with his role in the film ""Round Midnight."" If you are a Dexter man or woman, you will want this."
5,Easy assembly an is very sturdy.,"Wie loves t and it serves her well in use as a releif of carryng heavy items {mixer's, crock pot's, etc.from the pantry to theork area."
4,Useful little book,"Focused mainly on English table-top mills, and their use in making model engines, this book is a tad parochial. However, it will help the novice machinist learn about milling procedures and how to set up jobs. Particularly useful is a table of RPM recommended for different cutters on different materials. I think author's coments about milling machines willhelp the novice with the selection of a machine - what to look for. I personally found it very helpful - I am just learning how to use my Clausing mill and this book will help."
3,Good Cleaner Before It Dies,"I bought this carpet cleaner 2 years ago. I used it maybe all of 5 times. It worked extremely well on my light colored carpets. However I was only half way done my living room when it just died on me. No warning that it was going to break. I am extremely dissappointed!! I thought maybe it was just my machine but when I read another review of it dying after 5 uses, I decided to try the Hoover!"
1,Pass on this one,"We have five dogs and two kids, and thought we were making a good investment when we purchased the Bissell. Unfortunately after we used it only 3 or 4 times, we started to have trouble with it. I could not get it to spray solution on the carpet. I opened up the machine and saw that a bunch of plastic parts inside had broken. This machine is not well engineered, or built at all. I now have to buy a new machine, but this time I will be buying a Hoover, based on the other reviews I have read on Amazon.com"
2,Bissell 1699 poor quality,"I purchased the Bissell 1699 carpet steam cleaner two weeks ago. While using the machine for the first time we cleaned our living room rug which took aprox 1/2 hour. It seems that we spent most of our time just emptying the waste water basket because it does not hold much. The next day we attempted to clean the hallway rug only to find out that the beater brush did not rotate. We took a look at the beater and the whole assembly fell apart. The side of the brush is made with a cheap plastic insert which goes into a plastic housing which melted , making the whole machine inoperative. The machine would have been great of the beater brush were made to work longer then 1 use and the water basket were larger."
2,"breaks, breaks, breaks","Dont waste your money. After 3 uses it stopped spraying the cleaning solution. I got that fixed and then the pump went out. Now i have to buy a new one or stick more money into this one, i think i will buy a Hoover!"
2,Just Does Not Hold Up,Avoid this machine. I have purchased two of them because they do a really good job of cleaning and it is much easier on the back than the wand cleaners. I was extremely disappointed with the durability of the machine. I take great care to preserve the life of my equipment. This one just does not hold up.
1,Poor peformance and frequent repairs needed,"I have owned this carpet cleaner for over a year now. I have had it professionally repaired once, and my husband has had to repair it numerous times. The soap dispenser clogs, parts break easily and the suction is not good. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Old School Girl Group Influences New Generation,"I must say after listening to this collection of songs, one sees where groups of the 80s and 90s got their major inspiration from. This Jones Girls compilation showcases their hits from ""You Gonna Make Me Love Somebody Else"" to ""Nights Over Egypt.""Listening to these recordings displays some of the most talented ladies to ever record for Philly International. It also showcases the many talented songwriters of that time. Listening to ""I Just Love The Man"" is Gamble and Huff at their very best.This CD is a must have for those who are fans of 90s groups like SWV, EnVogue, and Xscape."
2,Ditto the other reviews,"I made the mistake of not believing the reviews and ordering the book. I assumed a certain amount of MicroSoft bashing was responsible for the low ratings, but that was not the case. It appears the author took what was avaiable from the FS2002 CD Flight Book, added a little bit of real world aviaton material, and included a few tid-bits of helpful information to create a book. I have spent 15 minutes looking it over and will probably return it. There is such an incredible amount of information that can be used to optimize using the FS2002 that I expect a legitimate handbook to be produced soon. A lot of what is contained in this book is basic filler material, if you are already flying around succesfully with FS2002 I strongly suggest you look elswhere for a manual to improve your flying."
1,A big letdown and a big waste of money,"I agree with everything the other reviewers have said so far. There is absolutely NOTHING that can be gained from reading this book, except for a few web addresses which can easily be found with a search engine. Save your time. Save your money. Save your disappointment. Do not buy this book."
2,Not At all What I Expected,"Folks, I hate to say it, but don't waste your time on this one. This is not at all what I expected in a ""strategy guide"" and does not at all match up to the previous flight sim strategy guides, which were done much better. I keep checking back to see if anyone has written a helpful manual, but haven't found it yet. I certainly don't need a book that is not much more than the documentation that is on the CD!"
1,A BIG WASTE,"As anyone who has purchased Microsoft's Flight Simulator 2002 knows, the software comes with no manual...only online documentation that's not the same. When I first heard about this book I was therefore very excited to get something on paper that would help. In particular, I need to find out more info on GPS navigation and using Air Traffic Control (ATC). This book fails miserably to help in these areas. It would have been nice to just include a Gate-to-Gate tutorial flying from say Los Angeles to San Francisco on a large jet and telling you how to set the NAV radios, tell you the correct speed, etc.Nothing like that in this book! It won't even teach anything about taxiing from the Gate to the runway. I too hope someone else will have the foresight to put together a good manuel for FS2002."
5,where have all the third eye blinders gone?,"of course never let you go is not a bad song, because none of theirs are, but it is a good song to have on the radio because songs get ruined on the radio. better never let you go than red summer sun or 1,000 julys, or deep inside of you. third eye blind was an awesome band, but there maturity i must question...because why is kevin gone? and no 3eb member will talk--someone has done something devious and sooner or later the truth will come out."
2,"paying for the ""name""",Why not save a couple bucks (or $10) and get another Kingston or SanDisk 1 GB SD card?
3,Topper,"Add a star (****) for the picture; subtract a star (**) for the lousy colorization. Whatever happened to the original b&w; version?Cary Grant and Constance Bennett are two recently deceased fun-loving, rich party-goers who come back to haunt the life of straight-laced banker Cosmo Topper (played by Roland Young). Bennett turns Topper's life so upside-down that he leaves his wife to have a good time with her. Of course it's all made right again before too much damage is done. The first 1/3 and the last 1/3 are the best parts; the middle part sort of drags. The picture is lots of fun. Worth a watch."
2,MILDLY ENTERTAINING..............JUST ADD WATER!,"I caught this film on the MGM HD channel and it looked great. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough to make this a great film. This film was OK and had some unintentional funny moments to keep my interest. It's kind of a mummy variation, sort of, at least the idea.....a little. one of the funniest parts of the movie is this ""faceless man"" is slow! and couldn't catch a cold let alone get close enough to anyone to kill them! If you remember the Mummy films from Universal's 40's series you know what I mean(RIGHT CB? :-D), but at least in those films the Mummy would kind of sneak up to his victims and then grab them. In this film I laughed out loud as this creature movie at a glacier's pace across the room as a woman droped to the ground in horror waiting to be murdered. Hysterical! I don't know about the DVD, but this film is mildly entertaining at best. I wouldn't waste my money on it."
4,Truly 'leet tea,"Aside from the small problem of the plunger not staying in the ""up"" position during brewing, this is a flawless teapot. The leaves stay in the infuser, the plunger doesn't massacre the leaves, and you wind up with a perfect cup of tea without having to annoy an overburdened ship's computer. I'm impressed. The plunger problem prevented me from giving this 5 stars."
3,"Not as ""Boer""ing as you would think","Being that as far as I can tell this is one of the few books written on this subject. I found this book to be well written and very informative. It explores a part or irish history that most people know nothing about. It gives insight into revelutionary thinking prior to the build up to the rebelion of 1916. I only wish that the author would have spent more time detailing the activities of the irish brigade in the war. Although , He has written ""MacBrides Brigade"" wich I assume is a more complete study the subject."
1,Over and over and over and over,This is one of the most irritating songs I've ever had the misfortune to listen to. It was played over and over and over and over again on the radio. It got to the point where I just turned the radio off whenever the song was played. I'm so glad that they're not playing it over and over and over again anymore.
3,3 stars is generous but may be better in the future,Was this supposed to be about 2 gay guys because that what the video is like.Well they both did good vocally they both kept on saying over and over you guessed it over and over.Could be better in 5 years like Ride wit me was
2,This product literally stinks,"Picked this up from Costco, who I usually trust to have great quality products, to replace a smaller and even less effective hand-held ""little Green Machine."" The biggest and nastiest problem is that I use it to clean up urine messes made my my 12-yr. old dog and it now wreaks of dog urine. No matter how I clean it stinks so bad I have to keep it in the garage. The sprayer now just makes litle piddles on the carpet (have owned about 1 yr.) as hardly any water comes out. The suction head always got clogged with dog hair and was a pain to clean. The head would also leak out dirty water (right back on to the carpet I just cleaned) if I didn't hold the head upright before I turned off the vaccuum. And it left the carpets so wet that I got darkening from mildew a couple of times."
2,Initial quality doesn't hold up,"I've had this vacuum for over a year and used it probably 10 times. The brushes and spray system are excellent. However, the latch mechanism that holds the solution resevoir onto the unit has broken (not well-designed) and the motor sounds (and smells) as if it's about to blow up. For the money, I expected more."
1,I should have read the reviews BEFORE I purchased this.,"I guess it's good if you got a little stain on your couch and it has to be cleaned up immediately. Unfortunately, I have a couch that stains when it's wet, even just with water.Not only did this not pick up my stains, but it made new water stains. I really wanted something portable to clean my entire couch. This is definitely NOT the product to do that.I'm just going to spend the money and get it professionally cleaned and return this one."
1,Don't Even Bother!!!!,"Buy a sponge and a bottle of Resolve, it will give you better results. This machine stopped working after only one use. (It no longer sprays the cleaning fluid)"
4,"Finally, my sofa doesn't smell like a dog.","Okay, the hose needs to be longer, and who wouldn't want a little more powerful suction, but I've actually cleaned entire rooms with this thing, from furniture to carpets, and even my best oriental rugs. My only real problem with this machine is getting it back from my brother, who keeps borrowing it to clean the upholstery in his car and the carpeting on his boat."
5,Works Great!,"After receveing my Little Green, I could hardly wait to get it out of the box. I have an older couch and chair that have never been cleaned. I'm almost ashamed to tell you about how black the water was in the dirty water tank after I was done cleaning. And to think my family and I have been sitting on that grime for years. After the wonderful job it did on my furniture, I took it outside to do my minivan, and it worked just as well. It took the salt and dirt stains right out of my floor mats. I am very impressed with this prodcut!"
1,TurboBrush is anything but turbo; doesn't spray well,"I bought this thing and was excited to use it. The TurboBrush spun around so slow it was worthless. Plus, you can't use the TurboBrush with the suction at the same time so you get too much water on your upholstery. The spray also got clogged after a short period of time. Save your money and buy or rent something else."
5,An excellent look at a complex story,"I thought this movie summed up the overall concerns and issues associated with teaching evolution in public schools very well. It really gives you insights into the players and personalities on each side. It's also an excellent look into the background on the teaching of evolution, including such gems as the Scopes Monkey trial and the(now debunked) Haeckel's drawings.Highly recommended for anyone interested in this issue."
2,Mediocre ideas and execution,"Well, caveat emptor.Compared with ""Gasland"", this film has no urgency, and feels like an exercise in ""What can I do with existing tv footage?"" The rambling soundtrack is completely irrelevant, and makes me think the filmmaker was unaware of being caught up in the Yo-Yo Ma Bach Craze of 2004.Good to see that many people enjoyed it, but I did not."
2,Excellent book for people who never programmed before,"It's a great book for beginners. I don't want to repeat what all other reviewers said (none of them said anything negative).Buy this book if you don't know much about computers or never used Java IDE's like Visual Age, Jbuilder, etc.Don't buy this book if you're looking for information on advanced Eclipse programming(like web applications and J2EE).The reason I gave 2 stars is that book overpriced-... for 376 pages book where some of the processes like copying files from CD are repeated in each chapter and large portion of the book contains information about downloading and installing software like Winzip, JRE and, etc."
2,"OK, but not much from a DBA side of things","To be fair, the book title suggests that it is for the software developer, and not a database administrator. I thought that it had a good overview of agile related items. Although it was probably not as useful for software developers who might have more exposure to the agile methods. From a DBA point of view, I thought it was a nice overview because agile is not typically used in DBA teams.As far as specifics relating to databases, I thought it could have had more real-life scenarios and suggestions on how to deal with them. Some of the ideas presented were just too unrealistic for my liking.That being said, there are a few good ideas in this book. It was a quick read too. So if you are a DBA who has no idea of agile, it might be something to start with."
4,Good overview of the issues and techniques,"If you are looking for a broad overview of how to develop applications that use databases (typically relational DBs), then this is a great start. Many different topics are covered, including cultural and personal issues in teams, which are very important. The chapter on mapping objects to relational databases was probably the best, and I also found the database refactoring advice useful.If you are also looking for depth of coverage of the above topics, you will have to look elsewhere, perhaps after reading this book to get a very high-level treatment of the topics. I found myself thinking, ""This is great. I agree with this advice. Now what do I do?""The book doesn't come down to a low enough level to really put you on solid ground, but if what you want is wide coverage of all of the elements that go into developing database-based applications, this is a well-written book to begin with."
4,For my 5 year old son,This costume is great. My 5 year old loves it and actually thinks it makes him faster. It's durable and seems like it will last until he outgrows it.
4,Great for Reading and Sleeping,"This album is great for reading and sleeping. The music is quite repetitive, but when I think it's getting too repetitive it changes. I am satisfied with my purchase."
5,Action-Packed Jerry Lee Lewis Live!,"This CD is the finest Jerry Lee Lewis performance out of all of the CDs and video cassette tapes that I have of him. Most of the songs are fast-paced ""action"" type instead of his slower (country-style) music.This is a must for any fan/collector of JLL. Hopefully more CDs of this quality will be available by Jerry Lee soon."
3,Non-essential,"Fascinating Hieroglyphics is an inferior work. Despite the claims to ""teach the reader how to read hierogliphics"", the book's author merely throws more and more symbols at you, seemingly without any organization or concept, rather than through any useful system, and later refers the reader to one of the more respectable works in the field. The ""alphabet"" in the beginning barely begins to cover a small portion of the Egyptian monophonics, and the hieroglyphs that ARE shown are merely noted for one or two of their multi-faceted meanings, rather than revealing the leading concept of the symbol. If you want to gain some basic grounding in reading hieroglyphs, choose some other work. I would refer you to Rossini's Hieroglyphs, unfortunately out of print, which actually tackles the subject head on rather than weaves its way out of the obligations it puts up."
2,A Story that could have been so much more.,"I read all these glowing reviews for this book and I hate to burst everyone's bubble but this book was not that good. There are some wildly imaginative elements in this story, but the author failed to fully exploit them. Instead she focuses on the same unremarkable characters from the first book. And again we see the ""Double Barreled Pump Action Shotgun"", the thing must be heavy. There is so much more that could have been done with her idea of the ""Light Zone, Grey Zone, and Dark Zone"". Just when the story becomes highly exciting -FLASH- She switches to another tired character performing mundane activities. The ending was anti-climactic to say the least. Reading this book was more of a chore than an enjoyment. Look elsewhere for apocalyptic fiction."
1,Sees about as much UVB as a shadow...,"Well, we got this to test out on the Powersun bulbs produced by ZooMed. These are mercury vapour bulbs used to give off essential UVB that reptiles require to process Calcium & Vitamin D3. These are industry standard bulbs for San Diego Zoo, as well as many other large zoos & educational establishments.According to this little meter, none of our bulbs are giving off ANY UVB, neither are our flourescent UVB tubes. Apparently the sun's a little lacking in UVB too these days - even here in Sunny ol' Florida.For 28 bucks, with the potential savings (if it worked) for a great many people, it was worth buying just to see if it was any good. Now I've actually seen how it works, it's worth about $3 for a neat lil digital clock. That's about it though."
5,Does everything I need,"This trimmer is adequate for a small yard. I was able to do my yard on a single charge. It was not too heavy. It seems to be ergonomically designed. While some have decried it not having a rotating head, I had no trouble tilting the trimmer to cut next to sidewalks, etc. This is a solid, dependable trimmer. Assembly was very easy. Just insert part A into Part B and you are ready to go. Anyone who cannot assemble it should probably not be using power tools."
4,Everything I hoped for,"Great product! Does the job of its gas powered counterparts without the hassle of keeping a separate gas-oil mix (two-cycle) gasoline supply. Recharge time seems minimal, and there`s always plenty of power to get the job done. I`ve never owned a battery powered yard tool before, but it seems like my gas powered weed whackers have usually only been good for about one season. Yet to be seen how long this one lasts, but if it only lasts one season, I`d still buy another one to replace it. I have a feeling this one will last a little longer than that."
1,Just Returned It... worthless junk,I tried and tried to get this thing to work. It would not release additional line for some reason. I am surprised it is such poor quality. I here again searching for one that does work.
2,My experience...,I'll keep it short:PROS:LightweightCheapHolds a chargeGenerally well ratedCONS:Line won't feed properlyLacks cutting powerGuard pops off/won't cut lineNOTES:I may have had a defective model so keep that in mind. I returned it to Home Depot and bought a Worx 18v (so far so good).
3,Tiny Toy Trims Tidily,"This trimmer is not for tall people. I'm 5' 4"" and it is just about right. It runs out of power before I finish my yard, but what do I expect for such a good price? It's nice and light, so it's even a useful tool for little old ladies (I'm not THAT old, but getting there). I'm a lefty, so I can't use my thumb as recommended for the side button to keep the power on. That hasn't been a problem; I just use the side of my hand and it works fine. There is a bit of a trick to assemble the handle of the trimmer. You kinda have to bump it hard against the ground to get the snug fit, and then you are ready to go! It comes with thread to start with, which is nice. I like my new toy."
4,Not a bad unit,"This is a great product for the cost. Not only is it ""green"", but it does the job. I would not recommend this unit for cutting down small trees or anything, but it's great for weeds and plants.The Toro is lightweight so it's easy to carry around. The battery charge lasts plenty long for the bulk of my yard work. The cord radius isn't exactly huge, but I'm just using it to clean up some of the weeds around my yard. It's fairly quiet and has a good deal of torque to it.There are several reasons why it will never be a 5 star item in my book:1) It'll never replace a gas powered trimmer2) The range is small3) The bottom piece with the trimmer is too heavy and contact is lost, causing the trimmer to shut off. A simple reconnect works.Otherwise, this thing is great and DEFINITELY worth the money!"
3,Looking for another trimmer,At first we were very happy with this trimmer...However almost a year later we are looking for another trimmer.....The battery is only holding up for about 15-20 min now...It never did hold the whole 45 min run time - about 35min... Just thought we should mention this to all shoppers!
3,You always need a little ruffage in your diet,"These hard rockin' Brits were too early to benefit from the garage rock hype of 2002, but even if their timing had been better I'm not sure the forecast for their destiny would have improved. They aim for a sound that is halfway between the Ramones and Creedence Clearwater Revival - and they succeed in the same way Joan Jett succeeded in mixing the Sex Pistols with Gary Glitter. That is, with the best parts of both antecedents crushed down into a decorative powder. So while I kinda like ""Uppers and Downers"", I can't get behind it with much enthusiasm."
3,Not As Good as Lamb Chop Playhouse,"Got this movie because I couldn't find Lamb Chops Playhouse anywhere for purchase. Not really worth the trade off, it's a very different Lamb Chop then the one I watched as a kid. That being said, my son really enjoys it so it serves its purpose."
2,LSU tigers band,Needs to have more current band playings like some of the tone that they play while marching down victory lane before the games and also while the games are playing.
3,Tired of being sick and tired.,"I wanted to read this book several years ago, but I was too busy being like the people in his book to read it. It's easy to digest; I finished it in less than a day. It is a better read for some white person looking for enlightenment than for one of us enraged, discontented, over-educated folk."
4,Extremely useful across the board reference for retirees,"There are many, many bits and pieces of useful advice and direction to guide retirees or soon to be retirees floating around in the book world. This book has done a masterful job of bringing most of the key decision factors and issues together under one ""roof"". Not only are the standard factors-finance, climate, entertainment etc covered but personal emotional and physciological issues are covered. The handling of death, care giving, emotional trauma are covered. Perhaps a most useful feature are the numerous matrices and check list tables throughout the book. Example-the check list of values Vs time allocated to these values will let a lot of people decide what is really important to their retirement ""health"".This allows management of time and prevents frustration."
1,"Horrendous Synthesized ""Orchestra""","I borrowed this from the library for my 4 year old to teach her about the sounds of the orchestra, but it's a cheesy synthesizer! Ripoff."
3,Works well for specific applications,"I ordered this thing because our software product needs to support digital notepads, and we are supporting more than one type. If you want to capture handwriting and transfer it to a pc, it works very well. It is reliable, and the quality is great. I did not even install the software that came with it, because I wrote my own translator to superimpose the handwriting over pdf forms. In my experience, the software that comes with these kinds of devices is mostly junk. This thing seems to have been designed for free form writing on blank (or lines) stock. I would not recommend it for forms, because there is no clip to keep the paper in place, so registration could be a problem."
2,Good Switch - Very bad cables,"The switch has nice features. One can switch from the unit or from the keyboard. There are LEDs to indicate the status of connected systems.BUT, the included cables simply do not support high resolution. This switch is claimed to support 1920X1440 but I had lots of trouble getting 1280X1024 out of the cables. When I used my cables from an older IO Gear 4-port switch I was able to get the proper resolution."
4,nice KVM - but award keyboard hot-keys,"This is a nice inexpensive 8-port KVM. Build quality is similar to the more expensive equivalent Belkin KVM (which I also own). I bought this IOGear to replace a Belkin that now has display sync issues.However, the keyboard port switching hot-key on this IOGear KVM is not too friendly (loss 1-star rating because of it). You have to press (in sequence) SHIFT, CTRL, ALT, and then the port number (all within 1-second of each other). Not exactly the easiest to do. I wish they kept their old hot-key sequence (which was simply pressing the left or right CTRL key twice to go up or down a port).Would I buy this again? Yes I would.IOGear makes one that can be cascaded, which I may consider trying the next time around; but it is more expensive."
3,Carr Hoop Review,"Honestly, these will be fine for what I need them for. But.... If you have any one that is over 190-200 lbs getting in and out of your pickup I would not reccomend these. Even when I use them (Im 180 lbs) they flex a fair amount. They are mounted to the inside lip of the rocker and this is not a real sturdy point. They are also made a little lighter than they look. For the price Im happy with them, but for serious use I would go with some thing a little heavier duty."
1,Motorola SSN 5683A Cell Battery with little battery life span.,This phone cell battery was purchased 3/18/08. It does not recharge any more. It just lasted about a month. I have noticed that its origin is from China and finished in China. My original battery that came with the phone indicated its origin from Japan and finished in China. This leads me to believe that batteries with its origin from China are of poor quality and a waste of consumer money.
2,Dated Lithium Cells,"I ordered two of these batteries. The two I received are genuine Motorola batteries with the hologram and everything, and I was also pleased by how quickly they were shipped.The manufacturing dates of the lithium cells are printed on the front of the batteries. One reads 20041123, the other 20050327. Lithium cells lose capacity sitting on a shelf, and three years certainly cuts the useful life of these batteries.The price is a lot better than ordering fresh batteries from Motorola, but I would prefer to have read on the product information page that these cells had been sitting on a shelf for three years."
3,Does the job,"I'd read mixed reviews on these obviously older batteries and crossed my fingers and ordered one since it was really cheap and cell phone stores don't sell them anymore. It arrived quickly and I made sure to charge it fully for the whole 48 hours before using it. I was going to recharge it after it had nearly drained and THAT wasn't very long.. actually only lasted about 5-6 hours. The second charge was just overnight, and now it lasts about 2 days. Not exactly as strong as a new battery, so while I'm not thrilled, for now it does the job and it didn't cost but about $5 including shipping, so no complaints. Also, it is not an OEM, but is identical to the original battery that came with my Motorola V551 phone."
5,I'D LIKE TO START A LEGACY WITH HIM!,The cover is one of the hottest covers I've seen in quite awhile (especially if you see it fully open). The story was pretty good but the love scenes left a little to be desired. Dillon Blackhawk should have been a biker with his attitude and looks.
2,Not very buckwheat-like,"Anything made from buckwheat flour is very very dark and dense in color. Although this mix is fairly dark in color it doesn't taste as buckwheatie as when i make pancakes from buckwheat flour from scratch. Awful lot of sugar and salt added to the mix too, which i try to avoid."
3,"I expected original cars in an ""originality guide"".","I am mostly interested in the 71-73 models so I only speak here about that section of the book. I was expecting an ""originality guide"" and I feel this book could have been better. Originality begins with the cars that are being photographed. When I see cars that are poorly assembled, have after market parts, pitted chrome, rusted parts and downright incorrect striping schemes I lose confidence in the book. There are better cars out there that could have been used. I would have preferred paying more for a higher quality book. On the plus side, this book does have a good year-by-year description of options and more interior photos than is usually found in other books."
3,The key is the blues,"This CD is not for everyone, even for people who like early Tom Waits music. The key here is the blues. Waits will snarl, bark and growl his way thru a song, not to be pretty, but to convey the emotional depth of the blues the same way Howlin Wolf or Lightning Hopkins used to play their blues music. Damn straight, Waits has got the blues and may be America's number one bluesman, bar none."
2,Song Titles Don't Belong to Songs Being Sung,"I just listened to both cd's and discovered that the song titles don't belong to the songs being sung. The songs seem to be on the cd's but they're totally out of order. That means that when I move them to my mp3 player, I'll have to rename every single one of the songs -- but the original cd's will still be wrong. Do I want to do that? Have to think about it. But buyer beware!"
5,Perfect.,"These guards look great because they are white, are easily installed. They not only protect toddlers and older children from potential falls they are very easily removed in case of fire."
3,"If you live in a world of too much documentation, read this","For those few places left that steep themselves in documentation and don't have a legally-required reason to do so (do they exist?), this book should help motivate why producing too much documentation and doing too much modeling up front can hurt rather than help. Even for a company that sees itself as lightweight, he's got some rough assessments you can do to see if you're overdoing things, which were relevant even where I work.The only bad thing is that it was a very theory and ideal oriented book. It didn't contain concrete examples of what Agile Modeling would look like on a real project, how it would feel, and how what models were produced would evolve. This made it a bit difficult to verify my interpretation of the book."
1,Item is totally different from the image!,The product that arrived is totally different from the picture. I am returning the product.
3,The Worst In the Series,"Druuna has always been a record breaking series, proving that erotic fiction does not have to be plotless or just for men. With the first book, Morbus Gravis, the author presented this idea - which is why it's so beyond me that he wrote this sequel the way he did. Still, though a little light on plot and a little heavy on S&M, there are some developments, and some extremely memorable moments. If you miss this one, I wouldn't sweat it; it's not crucial to what is otherwise a fantastic and ground-breaking series. This book is good, but not great; if you're looking for great, check out the third and fourth books in this series, Creatura and Carnivora. For some ""light"" fun, get this one."
1,Not safe for a baby!!!,"I bought this unit when I was 3 months pregnant for my son. I liked that the colors were neutral and could be used for either sex. I had my son 3 weeks ago, and used the playard for te bassinet next to my bed. After one week of use the bottom center of the playard popped up and one of the sides collapsed which tipped over the playard with my on in it. Luckily he was so small he only rolled into the side of the bassinet and did not fall to the floor. This incident could have been a lot worse. I called Evenflo's Customer Care Line and they will reimburse me for the playard. I would have expected this from a cheap unit, but not for the price I paid. I now own a Graco Pack n Play, which I love and must say is better manufactured in every aspect. I feel Evenflo should recall this playard to prevent further injuries."
1,"Actually, less than 1 star - what a waste of money!",This book is a farce. Poorly written and truly a waste of time and money. I recommend - ANY other Author! I was inspired when I first saw the book and TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED when I tried to read it. No wonder so many of his books are up for re-sale!
4,Good bag,"This is a good gym bag, good size, not too big, not too small. I wish it had a water bottle holder, but other than that, it's great."
5,sturdy bag not to big not to small,"I hook it to my bike basket and go. Compact design easily holds a change of casual clothes and plenty more. Hook rings, handle and zipper are of heavy duty construction.Outside pocket is very convenient.Like all Ogio products I have owned, thoughtful Design and Quality come first, at a reasonable price."
5,gym bag,I love this gym bag. The quality is excellent and a nice pale pink color. I would highly recommend it! There is alot of room to put everything you need.
3,Darker than in picture,The shirt is larger than one would expect and much darker than the picture. Otherwise it is very pretty.
1,Enamel came off in 3rd use!,"After two previous meals we made soup last night. Funny that the soup was crunchy, and we found bits of what looked like egg shells. We cleaned it and found a 1.5"" circle of the enamel had come off! I e-mailed Lodge (with pictures) but have not heard back yet.Are they made in Tennessee, or in China?"
5,casserol,this is my best looking piece of cookware and its great for any tomato based sauces or fried chicken i use all the time and the price on amazon was better than anywhere else
5,"Great for baking, frying, simmering...what's not to love?","I've fried chicken, roasted lean meats, made paella and rice dishes -- everytime successfully. And what's more, clean up isn't a nightmare. Plus, because the casserole retains its heat, I find that the food stays delightfully warm without the stove/range needing to be on.I have other cast iron enamel cookware that I love. And this compares very well.The only caution I have is to those people who have a ceramic-topped electric range or range top. Cast iron cookware is not recommended for those. But it works great with induction or gas tops."
3,A Tad Tedious,"This guide gets a bit too wordy with anecdotal comments. I have little patience when I am trying to learn a new form of development. I would have preferred that the author got to the point with fewer words. Also, I would prefer that the samples be more practical/predictable. This way, I can focus on DCOM instead of trying to determine what else is new about a code fragment. Case in point; kidnapper/ransom transaction application versus traditional bank money transfer app."
5,The best (and only) reference for your trip,"If you are planning a trip to Phaic Tan, you won't find a better reference guide than this one. While looking for ideas for travel for our 75th wedding anniversary, we stumbled on this book full of gems. What better get away than a visit to the Pha Phlung province?Surprisingly comprehensive, we've shared the joys of Phaic Tan with many of our friends via this book.The one minor quibble I have with this book is that I would have liked to see more coverage of the northern neighbor, Phic Shun. Tour books of these countries are like the countries themselves, hard to find.Check out the publisher's website for more details..."
3,Scholarly architectural history ...,"This little book is packed with the author's detailed opinions about the history of this marvel. It's good reading to prepare one for a visit, but it left me wondering if the legends that the author debunks may not be a prophecy of what tomorrow's scholars may think of this work."
5,Gotta love that Kit Kat Bar!,This is my 2nd favorite candy bar. I like to put these in the freezer before I eat them. They are even more crisp. Dunk them in milk. What pleasure that is.
3,not the best,"Tight Grooves, and some catchy tunes. Some of the jamming goes on way too long for the amount of content that it actually consists of. The rhythm section sounds great, the keyboard solos are pretty cool, if a bit slow, but the guitar player doesn't really demonstrate any knowledge of jazz harmony, which is important in this kind of music. He plays flute and sax too, which is nice, but his flute solo on track 3 sounds like any of his guitar solos. Too bad, this could otherwise be a pretty smokin' band."
2,Save your $$,My 4 year old son received this as a Christmas gift and was thrilled to play with it. His excitement soon turned into frustration when the walls kept coming apart and the chain on the draw bridge kept breaking. I would put it back together and within 5 minutes of normal play it was all apart again. I was also concerned with all the small parts since I also have a 1 year old. All in all it's a great idea though it could be better built. I would save your money and childs frustration and look for something different.
2,Huge Disappointment,"Our sons love Playmobil toys, and we have a large collection of them, dating back to the early 80s. I can honestly say that this is the first real dud we've come across - it falls apart from regular use (just opening and closing it - not throwing around or anything), and after spending more than a year patiently putting it back together, we finally just threw it away. It's a great idea, but so poorly made that I would be hesitant to purchase another Playmobil ""Take-Along"" item again. Don't waste your money!"
1,Bad Castle,"Thought it would be fun, but not at all. Does not stay together; many small parts which end up all over the house; hidden door broke off. Not durable at all - didn't even last a week. Threw it away and ordered the castle from Imaginext."
2,Ok unit,"Gaggia used to be the cat's meow in espresso. They have lost the bubble in the last ten years. Many other machines do more, are easier to use, and produce better cups in an easier manner. i still have my old Gaggia, but now rely on a Saeko in my home. The difference is obvious."
1,Dead on Arrival,"We ordered a new Gaggia Titanium from Whole Latte Love. I got the Ventilate message three times in 24 hours. They try to tell you that this is normal, but it's an obvious defect. I had a Gaggia Syncrony Compact for 8 years before this and never once had a ventilation issue. They want you to remove the water tank and squirt water into the machine's (water) hole (like an enema) to clear it with a turkey baster they send with the machine. It's so common that there's a video on youtube on how to remedy the problem. If it's so common, they should engineer a solution. We're talking about an air bubble here, not putting a man on Mars. For the price, and given how long this product has been on the market (since 2006), it's really disappointing. Having said that, I would buy another Gaggia Syncrony Compact if they still made it. It had not digital display, but worked like a charmed without problems for 8 years. This is a classic case of making a good thing worse."
2,Look Great,"These look great but don't expect to wear them all day at the office or your feet will be KILLING you by the end of the day. Great for an evening out paired up with some nice jeans. The toe box is tight, I find that my toes get squished but the length is fine. Beautiful shoes and fine for a few hours but that is all."
2,common sense,"I had to buy this book for a class and all I can say is that this book is common sense.""Don't use demeaning language when talking to your coworkers"".It is also full of meaningless corporate buzzwords:""Don't engage in postmeeting negative criticism frenzies."""
1,THE MEXICAN TREE DUCK,"I LOVED THE TITLE AND THE BOOK COVER. IT WENT INTO THE ABYSS AFTER THAT. WRITTEN IN A SOPHOMORIC MANNER, WEAK PLOT AND BORING CHARACTERS. BUT, AGAIN, A MILLION DOLLAR TITLE."
1,Contrary to what people may say..,"The cream does reduce redness in 4 hours, but almost instantaneously brings it back after you've removed the cream - so no help there. In addition, like some have said, the cream dries up your pimples, but to an extent. Also, it soothes the pimples initial irritation but works TERRIBLY with make-up. Applying this under would create an extremely cake, uneven texture. If you remove the cream and directly add makeup (my biggest mistake), you will develop MORE pimples and the initial ones will still be there (as the same size). Would not use cream to cover a large surface, but PERHAPS once in a while for big zits. I foolishly made the mistake of giving this cream a chance over another gel I have, and I regret it. Overtime, you may have to look for another product."
3,Not strong enough for my skin,"Cons:This product wasn't tough enough to dry out most of my pimples. Too bad it wasn't strong enough for my skin. I usually have better luck with salicylic acid, but bought this on a whim and am now going back to SA. I wish it helped with hyperpigmentation.Pros:It went on smoothly and wasn't greasy. A tad shiny, however. No real smell."
1,not working at all..,"I have been using this item for one week since i got it..its not working for my acne...dont know why its reviews r so high scores...Clearasil Ultra 4 Hour Rapid Action Treatment Cream, Tinted Cream, 1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)"
3,gold diggers,"i just received this and watched it today and the first couple of scenes were skipped,and my dvd player is in a good condition, and i was disappionted about that. Other than that the movie brought back good old memories of my childhood, and i am glad i bought this but i wish it were an actual dvd, not dvd r."
4,A good clean adventure,"Having already seen the movie long ago, I saw it for sale and got it for my collection...."
4,what can i say?,"this number was not in my fav list, actually, i was expecting ""get another boyfriend"" to be released as the third single cause it was one of the best work material that they have ever did! ""more than that"" is good and easy listening type of music, it's what they r famous for, it's hard for me to review this single cause i like BSB so much, but.....ok, for BSB, always a 5 stars for them but as we r reviewing about the song, well, i'll give 4, sorry!"
3,Panavise Suction-Cup Mount,"It does stick very well to any flat surface, but mounting a point-and-shoot camera on inside of a front window of your car is problematic due to the steep slope of most windows and the shortness of the mounting arm. You end up with your camera mounted upside down ... and unless your video editing software allows you to flip the image it's pretty well pointless.There are extension arms available but the issue then becomes vibration with the extended arm."
3,Beware,"This is a quality product. However, the pictures on the product description page are misleading. The Panavise 809 I received only had the single knuckle. The pictures show a Panavise with an extension knuckle. This knuckle allows the user more options for mounting different cameras. For a good example of what I'm referring to, look at the picture of theDelkin Devices DDMOUNT-MINI Fat Gecko Double Knuckle Single Suction Cup Camera Mount. It displays the extended knuckle."
2,Came without extension,"I bought this mount for use with a camcorder on my cars windshield.It's IMPOSSIBLE! because it's not came with the extension bar, as shows in one of the descriptions picture.I'm really disappointed."
3,Good to a point,"I bought this to use for in-car videos using my small cannon camera.The pivit is not really enough to focus the camera downward when attatched to the windshield. And the extension of the arm is not really long enough to use a larger camera on.It may work mounted on the sunroof outside or on a side window, I have yet to try it.The suction cup does not adhere to my dash."
2,Needs Extension,This product will not work out of the box with the Kodak Zi8 or Flip Camcorders (possibly other pocket cams)on windshields. The Kodak Zi8 in the pictures above was photographed in a way that you do not notice the extension. The extension cant possibly cost that much more to be included with the product.
5,worked great,drove 2300 miles with my cam mounted to make a time laps on a trip from FL to CA. took the cam off at my destination and left the mount on the rear window of the truck. looked a month later and it was still holding strong.
2,It works BUT -------,"When I was searching for this product, the pictures showing up in Amazon searches were showing the items with the extender, but it never mention that this is being shipped without the extension from my purchase order. The only time it shows that it came with no extender was in the package sales statement. So you tell me, was I mislead into thinking that they come with extender or not."
4,A well made product,"Checking out this item upon receipt left a good impression on the product. It was much heavier and larger than expected and appears to be well made. Unfortunately, it doesn't work well with the intended item, a Creative Labs Vado video camera //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LK8P14/ref=ox_ya_oh_productEvery possible angle/position was tried, but the pitch of the windshields (yes, 2 separate vehicles, Ford & Subaru) did not allow this camera to set its sights straight ahead, it was angled upwards.Had it been compatible, it could have been a match made in heaven."
1,BOGUS PRODUCT,"Ordered the Panavise 809 window suction cup mount, and it came to me from VanGoddy ... I didn't get the extension arm with it, so I called Panavise and they advised me to check it for a patent number, which would be on the lip near the suction cup. I checked mine, and there was no patent number.. which indicates that it's a counterfeit product. Which was sold to me as a Panavise product. Now, I've got a product that is not supported by the company who it was supposed to have been made by, and nobody is answering the phone at VanGoddy. My reason for calling Panavise in the first place was to try to get the extension arm for the 809.. then when we determined that I had a counterfeit product, they told me that even if I bought an arm, it wouldn't work on the counterfeit product. STAY AWAY FROM VAN GODDY!!!!!"
3,Still needs another extension,I bought to use for a Sony handy cam to be mounted on the windshield to tape me car racing. It didn't fit the camera without an extension piece. I sure don't remember it saying that in the description. Other than that the quality is sturdy and the suction cup is strong. It feels well built.
5,Great Deal,This is a very well built unit and very easy to use for not much $$$. Highly recommend if this is what you are looking for.
3,It's great if it's for a 5-year-old.,"I guess I was expecting more.If you have children, they would get more out of this. It reminded be of learning how to write in grade school. That's about all there is to it."
2,Numbing.,"Often painful to listen to, Holly lacks tone, pitch, and phrasing-three essential ingredients for jazz singing. The material is good, but one can't help feel that Holly is singing in the wrong genre: Perhaps she would be better as a rock star.The bottom line is that with such spartan accompaniment, a singer has to have an inner feeling for the music-and of course the talent to match. Holly has neither."
1,Not the Person You Think,"Pay attention. Read the subtitle carefully! The subject of this biography is not the Juan Bautista de Anza who established the first land route to San Francisco Bay in 1776 and was governor of the province of New Mexico from 1777 to 1787, but his father of the same name. This book is the first volume of what the author plans to be a three-volume series about Juan Bautista de Anza and his father. Other than a mention in the preface, little said of the son, who according to the preface, is to be the subject of volumes two and three. I am waiting for volumes two and three, and maybe only three."
5,T-BOZ is truly creative,T-Boz did a great job with her first poetry and essay book. Some of the poems are simple but touching. If she keeps it up shewill become a great poet.
5,One Beautiful Blade,"I gave this to my boyfriend for his birthday and he absolutely loves it. Blazin sharp, sexy, comfortable, balanced, everything you'd want from a knife."
4,"Strong prose, good characters and tense","I had concerns in the first few pages and even before that, from reading what the book was about, since the plot seemed far fetched. But Kyle saves himself with excellent prose, intertwined and deep characters, and by keeping things tense. There are a few plot stretches but by then I was into watching the characters handle unthinkable situations. Equally impressive (and sad) is how the book delves into terrorism in the U.S. This book has actually been crafted, meaning the writer does more than imitate or write boring templated stories. He gets credit for taking on something this big."
3,Good Fun (But Don't Take It Seriously),"Lots of ""buts"" in this one. Action-packed BUT implausible, plot line interesting BUT dumb, a doctor BUT a murdere. Why could't a Nobel Prize winner create a more humane / faster method for death. But that's all beside the point since the premis is already dated! Birth rates around the world are dropping. Some European countries are actually losing population & the UN Commission on Population has revised downward world population projections just the past year. Also, it is highly implausible that ""women's education programs"" will produce the desired results. For something that massive one needs to modify the water supply in some countries. Still, suspend your imagination and read it for the sheer entertainment."
1,"Horrible, locked up my PC -- returning","When I initially installed this, I was pleased ... for all of about 10 minutes. At that time, it COMPLETELY locked up my PC to the point where it was completely unresponsive and I had to manually shut it down. I had hoped it was a fluke, but the same thing continued to happen all weekend. I just uninstalled the software and have repackaged it to return to Amazon. I'm really disappointed, as this got some of the best ratings/reviews on Amazon."
5,moe norman book,"I ordered for a friend who does not have a computer. (who would have thought that in this day and age that some one does not have a computer). The book was sent promptly. As advertised it was in excellent condition. However, no golf book is going to help this guys game!!!I informed him ....... NO REFUNDS!!"
2,Container Kept Leaking,"I don't know what it was but the container would keep leaking around the bottom. The company was nice enough to give me another one free but that one too leaked. I honestly think it a design flaw.The water seemed to be tasty enough, definitely better than Brita filters, but had to be changed too often for my taste. The best thing you could do is by a reverse osmosis filter for the home. I only have to change mine once a year and the water tastes great as I have technologically verified as more pure than the tap."
5,Comprehensive anti-patterns review,"The authors have written a well organized, thoughtful catalog of mistakes commonly made by developers new to struts, ant and junit. This book is a great reference if you find yourself on a project that requires some refactoring in these areas, and it provides some unique insight from developers who have been there and pulled themselves out of these common traps."
1,Click the back button now and buy one of the other options,"Though these are purported to be for the kitchen and to have ""airtight"" lids, only the largest of the canisters managed to fend off the tenacious little buggies that somehow got into my pantry and started feasting on all the grains. And that particular canister's lid is a pain to get off. I suppose no pantry can avoid bugs for its entire life, which is why I bought canisters. I don't know what to do with the smaller canisters--they're too useless for food, and too ugly for the bathroom sink for cotton ball or q-tip duty. I've never felt so betrayed by a purchase from amazon."
2,DON'T BUY THIS TOY! LOOK OUT FOR YOUR HARDWOOD!,"Be SURE you don't even think about buying this toy. I got ours at the toy store with the big r for ten bucks last year and I'm glad I didn't pay more. Although it is a ton of fun and the kids certainly loved it, the darned thing ATE THE FINISH OFF MY WOOD KITCHEN TABLE! Now, I have this horrific looking ring and various other designs on my table, which are permanently white, meaning it completely stripped the table's finish. Now, just think about giving THAT type of product to a three-year-old and I think you'll agree. TAKE THIS THING OFF THE MARKET! Looks like I just spilled a bottle of nail polish remover all over the table. Again, don't buy this!"
1,Terrible!,"When I bought this there were no reviews. It looked really cool and I thought my 5 year old would love it. We bought it for Christmas, he tried it once and hasn't touched it since. It does not make pictures even close to the examples on the box. My husband tried using various amounts of drops and still could not get it to look swirled. Not worth the money at all."
2,it's okay,I bought the Reader Rabbit Toddler and pre-school because it was highly recommended but I don't see what all the fuss is about. It's OKAY but nothing spectacular (in my opinion). My 3-year-old likes to use it every once in a while.
1,Does not work on MAC,"Very disappointed. Just got a Mac last year and this game cannot be installed, in addition to most children's computer games lacking compatibility."
2,False Advertisement,"Although I've always been an amazon customer, this particular partner, Galactics advertised that this CD-Rom was Mac capable and it was not. Although they credited my account, there was no human contactor phone # everything was through email and was very frustrating."
4,Good TV Wall Mount,"I bought this to get my TV off the factory pedestal mount so that I could use the top of my entertainmet center for my surround sound front L/R & center speaker. Since the page for this mount actually says that it is ""for 13"" to 37"" Displays"" and I have a 32"" Samsung LCD TV it fits perfectly.I also like the construction of the mount which allows you to easily separate the portion which attaches to the back of the TV and the wall mount protion which while in place can be locked down to prevent movement but it also rests on a simple hook system that makes it very easy to simply unlock and lift the TV off the wall and replace it when any new connections, cleaning, etc. is completed.The only drawback for me personally is the same drawback with any Wall mount in that it sits close to the wall so connections are not easy while the TV is in the mount. I would recommend this product and buy it again if this one ever fails. I have had it in place for just about a year with no problems."
1,"Not with a bang, but a whimper","I guess Somheil knew Gold Eagle had lost the contract to publish the Destroyer by the time he was writing this. He puts little effort into making this a Destroyer book. The main characters aren't there much. Most of the middle of the book is an long extended dinosaur chase.It would be a sad end if it were the end. Fortunately, along with The New Destroyer, Tor is publishing The Best of the Destroyer. Readers who only know the Somheil Destroyers will be able to enjoy some of the earlier books when Warren Murphy and Richard Sapir were still writing them."
2,For die hard fans only,I don't know who the ghost writer is but the stories are getting dumber and dumber. Only for real fans of the series
3,Not getting the full feeling,Bought this item based on Dr. OZ recommendation. Thank goodness this item was in expensive compared to whole foods. I didn't feel the full feeling. Everyone is different. Try it it may work for you.
2,I Didn't Notice a Difference,I really didn't think this was any more effective than drinking a big glass of water. I was hoping to feel more satisfied with less food. Not so much.
1,Save your money,Doesn't stick to the keg. Magnets (Aluminum) and tape don't work so your left zip tying around the whole keg or coming up with your own creative solution. Then you have to spray the stupid thing with water to make it work... save your money and buy something useful. Or just burn it for warmth.
1,keg strip,"would not waste any more money buyimng the keg thermometer smart strip , the smart strip never changed , showing the keg getting empty"
4,The Untold Story -- Told,"A guy I know brought this back from England a few years ago, and I read it while on vacation. This is a great telling of the stories of British brewing in World War II, covering the early days of the war when drys tried to use patriotic fervor to stop brewing (they were soundly shut down and roundly criticized for using the war to further their mad agenda), the effects of The Blitz on London brewers and pubs, the lasting effects of low-malt brewing on brewers and British beer in general, brewing under occupation on the Channel Isles, and beer in victory, including the famous picture of a Spitfire with a ""drop-tank"" of cask ale. I guarantee this will be beer stories you've never heard before, and almost all of it a fascinating look at how British beer went to war, and like all the other boys (and girls) who 'saw the elephant,' came back changed forever."
1,---------------------> JUNK <---------------------------,"I bought one of these at an after Christmas sale...so I've used it for almost a year and can say that it consistently UNDERPERFORMS! The temp gauge is not reliable. Sometimes 350 is 350 and sometimes 350 means TOP BROWN....and yes, there's no BELL to let you know your toast is done.I've had a pizza slice I was re-heating catch on fire!"
1,Really bad,This is the worst kitchen appliance I've ever owned. I'm shocked B & D would sell it. It regularly gets stuck in the toasting cycle and (with no monitoring) would simply just keep toasting forever. I had a fire in mine about a month after getting it because I didn't know this.
4,Great Toaster Oven,"I love my Black and Decker TRO962 Dining In 4-Slice Toaster Oven. I use it daily and it cooks well, looks great, and is easy to operate. I purchased a much more expensive DeLonghi toaster oven less than a year ago and it developed a hazardous electrical problem with its wind up timer. This cheaper toaster oven cooks just as well and does not have a wind up timer for me to worry about. I recommend this product! The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is the fact that it only has a drop down crumb tray, whereas I prefer a pull-out crumb tray."
5,"Simple, Clear, Direct, and Intuitive","To start, I will say that I have lost 19 pounds since I obtained this book. That, to me, speaks volumes.I found the principles of this book to be very intuitive and in line with what I believe to be true. I personally did not feel that my weight problem and lack of health was something that could or should be ""cured"" by pills, medical procedures, and doctors - I was looking for common-sense solutions. That is what I found in this book.Without calorie-counting, or filling out forms and journals, or buying prepackaged foods, I have used the tools in this book to make HEALTH my focus, and it is truly working for me."
2,Not the Best,"This game may look fun, but it is not as fun when you play it. There are many things that you cannot do and can. You can fish, and gather plants. But you can only have two partners. When you finally get to Oregon (which is the only place you can go) you usually end up in a Hospital. You also have to start from Independence. The hunting is good. You have lots of game and you have a wide view."
2,Not so good.,"I got this as a gift, because I loved playing Oregon Trail in grade school. This version, though having much prettier graphics, isn't nearly as fun. Half the fun of playing it was naming all the people after your family, and reading the dirty limericks people wrote on the gravestones. Save your money, don't buy this."
3,Why doesn't it stand?!?,"I got this for my son after he dressed up as Mega Man for Halloween one year. While it is cool, and he loves it and plays with it... It doesn't stand up really well. It has this backward lean to it. You can turn the feet out so it stands but then it looks funny."
2,They should have kept it short.,"This book brings across several good points about the mental aspects of golf, and how to overcome the most common issues. The problem is that the authors take too long explaining their points. If it had been a third to half as wordy it would have been much more useful and certainly an easier read. I have tried reading it 'like a book' now twice, and somewhere in the second chapter I just lose interest. Golfers wants relatively quick explanations and remedies. This isn't one of them."
4,It's no Bamboo Forest...,"Granted, Steve Reid is multi-talented and a genius with music, but I guess I was a little disappointed with Water Sign because I put Bamboo on such a high pedistal. I really enjoy Reid's work with the percussion and making you feel like you are in a jungle, but this one won't do that for you. This is good, but not what I was looking for. Water Sign is better than Mysteries though."
1,Utter garbage.,"For her bona fides, check out the fact that she is a speaker at Regent ""University,"" a dumping ground for Pat Robertson ""scholars.""I just saw her strashing Obama on a crappy Fox News ""business"" show. You want juvenile pablum? Enjoy this nitwit's writings."
5,Good quality,"Worth the extra money for the genuine leather. Had a speed grip rubber steering wheel cover almost identical to this one and it has not survived the Florida heat and humidity very well. Got less than two years out of it, now the rubber comes off on your hand as a sticky black mess. Had a real leather one identical to this on the car when I bought it 8 years ago and it lasted me almost 6 years."
4,Great rap cd,"This is TRE-8's first rap CD before he did 'ghetto stories' on No-Limit rec. I'm from New Orleans where he's from and he's been producing records way before his first cd, he produced for MIA-X, and some other tight rappers from New Orleans.this is a cd to GET...DONT SLEEP ON IT..you'll mis out!"
4,You get what you pay for,"Before you buy this product, know that you are not getting the full version of the game. The White Label European version 1.2 of the game removed some content from the original American 1.1 version. The main difference being that children are removed and therefore some parts of quests and some quests entirely. I have not played the American version so I do not know how much was removed. If you're ok with a few things being removed and some of the violence dumbed down then this is the game for you. Also, this only comes with one DVD with all three games on it and no hard-copy manual. Although game guides can easily be found on the internet. I bought this purely for nostalgic purposes and it was really cheep so I didn't mind some missing content. Hope this guide helps you make the right purchase."
5,Still Number 1,"The fallout series is still the best adult RPG out there. No other game series (that I have played) has allowed the player to emerse themselves so much and allow one complete control of their destiny. Everytime I've played it, it has been different."
1,Not for windows XP,"The fallout collection 1 and 2 did not load and run on my windows XP machine. Even with patchs, compatability, and screen resolution changes. ("
5,"Stamp It, the ultimate stamp collecting activity book",I purchased Stamp It! for my nine year old grandson. The book is spiral bound and has a sturdy hard cover. It is colorful and informative. Great for the beginner stamp collectors.
4,Great for Kids Just Starting Out,"This particular book is great for kids just starting out stamp collecting. We used an inexpensive collection of used stamps to work on it that we purchased for under $5.00 off ebay to practice putting them into the different categories. It has places for you to collect stamps to tell about yourself (i.e. what your favorate color, flower, sport, etc.) and a family tree where you attempt to collect stamps from the birth places of your relatives which seems pretty fun, but a little challenging. For the price I thought it was a great way to get my little boy (8) into stamp collecting and gain a little knowledge of it. Would recommend for any child."
4,Good solid HARD ROCK!!!,"A good CD from a good band. Any rock fan should add this CD to their arsenal. A bit repetative, but still a good sounding, rock solid album. Well done, Future Leaders of the World!"
5,Music Review - LVL IV,"FLOW's newly released LVL IV CD is a culmination of long journey of talented musicians and their quest for making a mark on the music industry. Filled with raw exciting new talent, the CD has elements of old school grunge, rage, passion, and other elements combining into a very special music creation.FLOW is the real deal and a refreshing alternative to much of the music that currently dominates the radio waves. This disk is a must have for any contemporary music collection and promises to appeal to a wide audience ranging from teens to thirty-something's. Get the CD, and get ready to enjoy a musical odyssey from some talents young musicians. This disk promises to take these guys far; it's only the beginning.I already caught two shows and they are a must see live: visit http://www.futureleadersoftheworld.com for their complete tour schedule. ENJOY!"
3,Who do they want to be???,To me it sounds like a Nirvana riff and the singer is trying to sound like Sebastian Bach of Skid Row.
5,One of a kind!,"There was only one Kenny Dorham! Overshadowed in his day by the likes of Dizzy Gillespie, Clifford Brown, Miles Davis, Lee Morgan and Freddie Hubbard, Dorham's recorded legacy demonstrates with great clarity his singular contribution to the jazz trumpet tradition- a contribution that many of today's young and not so young trumpet players are trying to come to grips with. The vocal sound quality, harmonic slyness, and puckish phrasing are the cornerstones of his distinctive style. Simply stated, Kenny Dorham was, at least to this listener, the most soulful trumpet player who ever lived.On this particular album, Dorham benefits from the all-star support of Hank Jones, Oscar Pettiford, Sonny Rollins, and Max Roach as well as some undistracting harp backing on several of the tracks. The program highlights many of Dorham's special talents including his heartfelt way with a ballad (hear My Old Flame). Highly Recommended!"
1,It did not work the way I thought it should.,It seemed difficult to get the heart rate started and then seemed to hang up on a heart rate.
2,LOUD,The watch and chest strap is very easy to use. That is the good news. The bad news is that it is REALLY LOUD. It constantly beeps as it measures your heart rate. I cannot use it in an athletic yoga class to measure my output nor in a quiet gym. It is really distracting and makes it pretty much useless to me. I would NOT recommend the watch unless you are working out in a noisy venue.
4,Good watch at good price,"So far, so good.... this watch has been excellent in keeping my heart rate up. It takes some time to configuration it and it takes a little of me sweating before a good heart rate is shown on the watch. But it keeps me in good time with my running."
4,Heart Rate Monitor,"This is a great tool for monitoring your heart rate. With it's one button function makes it an eaze to use. The only problem is the chest strap. Sometimes it slips out from under my chest and stops monitoring. Other times it would feel too tight during workout even though I loosen the tension alittle bit. I wish they would make one that don't require a chest strap, and display continuous readouts when just worn around your wrist."
1,What is it?,"I give this album one star, and that's for the cover photo. That's all I know about the album. It's listed under Billy Joel, but the cover title says ""Piano Bar Tribute to Billy Joel."" By whom? You can't play the tracks; even the mp3 version indicates tracks are not available. This is marketing?"
3,Can't stand alone,"This would have been a shorter and better book without the constant reminders that it's one in a series. The reminders were not provocative in the sense that I can't wait to read the other books, but rather I was beat about the head with patronizing incentives to find out more about the lives of ancillary characters in the books that came before Only Love in the series. Sorry, but if the next in the series that I can lay my hands on, is as condescending...I probably won't finish it OR look for any more."
3,Like it but dated,"As someone who was born in between the 80's and 90's. I never experienced underground music of the 80's, and many favorite bands are present through out, Swans, Psychic TV, Current 93, Einsturzende Neubauten, New Order, Sonic Youth, NCoil, The Fall and Boyd Rice. Other I don't particularly care for like Laibach, Test Dept, Foedus, and Cabaret Voltaire. The interviews I enjoyed the most where ones with Genesis P Orridge, Mark E Smith, Mark Almond, and David Tibet. I nocited that both David Tibet and Genesis P Orridge where very knowledgeable in comparative religion and the occult, as well as current events and politics. Lydia Lunch and Nick Cave I found to be very boring, and I do enjoy some of their stuff. However I do wish their was a reissue of this book that was a little more up to date, and since the artists interviewed have gone in different directions."
2,A little dated.,Info. is a little dated. It is retro but still you might find some entertainment from it. The writing style is a little boring and hard to keep you interested even if you really like the bands.
3,Medium,"it works half way and i had to go over every spot twice, but at the same time it only hurts about half as much."
2,Takes a lot of strips to remove hair completely,"I was excited at first because there were a lot of strips to use, so I thought I could use a lot. Turns out it takes several strips to get the hair off completely. Plus, there aren't enough pre-moistening ""de-sensitizing"" wipes, in my opinion. There's a slight burn and sting which I experienced, and my skin turned red afterwards, even after applying the post-removal pads. The redness remained for a day or so. I probably wouldn't use this product again."
1,A waste of money,"I have heard about Nad's for years and finally bought a box of these strips. After reading the instructions and following them to a T, all I got was a lot of pain (and I've been professionally waxed), a sticky mess, and pinched skin with even a few blood blisters from the pulling. The strips removed some of the hair, but so little that I had to tweeze afterward. What's the point of using these, then? I am returning them to the store in hopes of a refund or at least store credit to try another brand."
5,Awesome product must have!!!,I bought this product from Walmart because I'm tired of spending money at the nail salons and spas for waxing. I just love how it gets the hair from the route. This is awesome and a must have!!!.....
4,Works good but takes some effort,"I don't use this, its for the women in the family. These wax strip works. From my understanding, the first couple of cycles hurt but it is suppose to get easier and hair should get softer after while. They like using the product because its clean and there are no liquid wax to deal with."
1,Did Not Like This Product,"I purchased the Nad's body wax strips and was disappointed. First off the desensitizing wipes don't work, it still hurts...a lot. My biggest complaint was the wax. You cannot get it off with soap and water. In fact I couldn't get if off for a couple of showers. It gets on your clothes when you get dressed. Not happy and will not buy this product again."
2,Still playing with it,"I've been slowly trying the strips. At first I thought my hair was just too short so it wasn't ripping any out. I try every few days just hoping that it'll magically work, haa. Today I realized that my biggest mistake was getting the wax TOO warm. It stayed too soft so it left a gooey mess on my legs instead of sticking to the paper. New trick: Take a cold water bottle and use that to rub the strip down. Even though this helped a lot, it still only rips about 50% of my hair off.Save the money and trouble and go for a warm wax."
4,Awesome read!,One of my all time favorite books to read. Can read it over and over again. If you want a great read then pick up this book!
3,Dissapointing,"I read all the reviews and was expecting to read a really good book. Instead I got one of the most depressing books I have ever read. El lobo had such a horrible, tragic life and it just kept getting worse for him. I mean how much can a person go through? The heroine, Storm, had an awful life too. Towards the end of the book, I felt like I was reading a novel by VC Andrews or Rosemary Rogers."
1,Boring,It's almost all partyand very little killerso this Troma Team releasemakes for a rather boring thriller1.5/5
3,Speculation,"I vaguely remember The Road Ahead as the speculation of the days to come for our culture and our civilization. Walters thought the monetary system would collapse into a bartering or exchange system without currency. There were the admonitions to live on the land and simplfy one's lifestyle. Apparently Yogananda suggested the same things, as the earth will provide support if cooperated with on a natural level. He thought communities centered on spiritual values and goals would become the new city/states of a revised culture. I think Walters also suggested some stockpiling - like earthquake preparedness on a grander scale to tide one over. There are few communities based on these principles, but they may well be the models for a more upscaled class of consciousness that is emerging on this planet......."
3,BRATZ TWINS,"Bratz Babyz ""The Movie"" Twiins Nora & Nita (with hair)CUTE! NOT WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS ORDERING. I LOVE THE WHOLE BRATZ LINE. GREAT FOR A COLLECTION."
5,"great, so many uses","Best sugar substitute I have found. Tastes so good and can be used in anything. Plus it is healthy, no cancer in lab rats for this product. Broke my addiction to sugar and I do not crave this. Tastes great in coffee and is also good for your skin. So many uses, I can not say enough about Agave. YUM!"
5,best for sweetner,"WE WERE INTRODUCED TO AGAVE BY OUR GRANDSON WHO WATCHES OVER OUR HEALTH,SO NOW WE DON'T CARE FOR ANYTHING ELSE.WE TRIED TO GO BACK TO SOMETHING CHEAPER,BUT DIDN'T LIKE THE TASTE"
5,Good Sweetner Substitute,"After all the research I have found on raw organic agave, I am very pleased with how it tastes and makes things sweet. There are some calories with this product, but I feel better about consuming a natural alternative for white processed sugar. This is an outstanding product."
5,RAW BLUE AGAVE,"I have purchased this 23.5 oz., pack of 6, sweetner now twice and both times have received my order quickly and in very good condition. I will buy it again."
5,Great Product,"I tried an other brand of agave but found that Wholesome Sweeteners has a milder taste. It's really good. It's great in tea and coffee. I also use it to sweeten oatmeal. I even transfer it to a smaller size that I carry in my purse. It's so much better than artificial sweeteners. I have not cooked with it; however, I plan to in the future."
5,Great buy!,We are so glad someone introduced us to Agave (dark)we use it instead of sugar it is great. Amazon had the best price.
1,why does this cost 51 dollars,"The price is ridiclous. At most you should be able to find it on CD for under 8. Look, its digital, cost of replication is nil. Just listening to The Nature of the Beast and remembering Powerplay and wanted it in my collection....but no way at that price..."
4,Revlon relaxer cream,"I have been using the revlon relaxer cream for years and it works really well for my hair, just follow the directions when you apply it."
1,do not buy this is waste of money,"plants arrived with no leaves, and 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch high. It will take 5 years to even see the plant above ground, let alone flower. If I could, I would get my money back"
3,MARY I GOTTA LET YOU HAVE IT!,"Ok Mary I love ya but I got to let you have it! Now Mary her other books were off the hook, but this book you were doing too much! First off let me start off by saying if the readers did not catch your message when you said please read the previous books then their fault! Oh my goodness I felt like I was being punished because Mary wanted to catch up the other readers who did not read her previous books. Some of the things that were going on in this book were unrealistic. Who in the hell was this crazy bag lady? She gave away the entire story. No suspense I knew what was coming next. And drama. I love drama but this book was going way too far! It was getting ridiculous! Darius and his 12 baby momma's! Fancy lying and her dad was crazy! Her 90 year old mother having a baby (LOL). The ending was crazy! Mary I expect more from you. Can you please come better than this? This all my opinion that I am entitled to. Right?"
5,Nothing Has Ever Felt Like This,This is a great book that will keep you up all night trying find out what happens next. Great book you will not be disappointed.
1,More Nonsense,"As PJ O'Rourke says, Liberalism is just Marxism by the glass. It's mind-boggling to think how much of a narciscist someone has to be to imagine that they have the knowledge and wisdom to write a plan to bring to peace and happiness to an entire country. And how out of touch they need to be to imagine that anyone else outside of a small fringe is going to even pay attention."
4,Outstanding!,"Love the CD. However, you have got to see these guys perform live. They put on a great show - both for the ears and the eyes."
5,A PURE CLASSIC!,"What can I said? This is a MUST(all capital,that's right!) for all hip-hop fans. This is IAM at his best! This is the ultimate reference of french rap; in fact it's the ultimate reference of rap. It's hard to pick a song that you don't like in this album no matter what language you speak. 16 tracks, 16 jewels! Just check out: ""L'ecole du Micro d'Argent"", ""Nes sous la Meme Etoile"", ""La Saga"", ""Petit Frere"", ""Un Cri Court Dans la Nuit"", ""Demain C'est Loin"", ""Un Bon SOn brut pour les Truands"". Should I go on? Get the CD and you'll see what I mean!"
5,Very impressed with musical as well as lyrical skills.,"Definitely good stuff. First of all, the music gets made props, though at first may sound a little similar throughout the whole album, in terms of beats and so on, after listening to it a few times, it get's in your head and you just love it. Lyrically, if you can understand, you will realize the crazy talent these people have. Even artistically they made an effort in presenting their album in a very far out samurai way. Nice one, bravo Marseille..."
2,Sizeing,The size of the rack would have really helped. I had to return it for it did not fit my pan size.
3,Tray,Too big for what I wanted to use it for. I looked at the measurements and it seemed okay but way too big so I haven't used it.
3,not sturdy,This product will work but it is not as sturdy as I thought it would be. Don't think I would try it with more than a 10 lb turkey.
2,there are better choices,If this book had not been required for a class I was taking I would return it.The pictures in the book of the hand formations are often hard to figure out andthere is no written explanation of the hand position or direction of movement. There are arrows that are suppose to show direction of movement but I found many of them confusing.It might not be the worse option but I wound not recommend it.
5,This cd is not so bad after all!,"I recommend everyone out there to get this cd because it has some nice cuts on here. You have Dmx, Jay-z, Amil, Montell Jordan, R-kelly and many more artist feature on here. Plus there is even a bonus track featuring the one only LL Cool J. This track gives you a brief sample of what is going to be on his new album, the G.O.A.T coming to you on August 22. My favorites tracks on this cd are, 2,3,4,6,10,12,and 15. Don't get me wrong every song on this cd is worth listening to while you're in your car cruising down the road. It's just that those tracks are the ones that I enjoy the most. So if you're that type of person who like music that will get you going, then cd is a have. What are you waiting for? Go get it today!"
4,Who's the boss?,"Like a typical first grader, Junie B. cannot wait to eat out of her brand new mail ordered lunchbox. However, she gets into trouble for sneaking a peak when students in Room 1 do not open their lunchboxes outside of the cafeteria. Just when Junie B. begins to bring her lunch, everyone else wants to eat prepared ones like the hoagies because they are better. She then wants one of her classmate's cookies from the lunchroom but instead Junie B. finds out the snack lady from last year works in the Cafeteria. She gets to be her helper, but who is really the boss? Children can see how Junie B. writes in her journal and corrects her spelling as she goes. This would be a great book to read aloud before or after lunchtime. Junie B. you make lunch fun!"
3,People need to lay off these guys,"I got this album as soon as i could. I was expecting some more rock stuff, but when i got this album it was a lot different than I expected. It wasnt 80's rock like i expected, but a more mellow, yet fun modern rock sound. I wasnt dissapointed at all. Joel Bell's emotional vocals really got to me, along with Mark's great guitar. Its a little softer, but shows great effort and lots of great talent. they didn't sell out, and they are not pleasing as many punk fans anymore. It's not my style, but im not going to get into saying this is crap just because I have a bias. It is skillfully played with a few beautiful medleys.Overall, an average album."
1,Another piece of Kawasaki junk,"The battery that came with the drill lasted through only 3 charge cycles. I ordered a new battery and it lasted no longer. Also, the thing just suddenly starts slipping and won't drill anything. Its 19.2 volt battery will not fit a Kawasaki impact wrench I also bought before I found out what a piece of junk this is. My advice is to avoid Kawasaki unless you are buying a motorcycle or car. They can't make cordless tools."
1,a peace of junk really,"i bought this kawasaki! at first i didn't that kawasaki makes drills. well i used it maybe for 10 days and the charger died it wouldn't charge anymore, don't buy this drill you will regret it. the price is cheap so I GOT WHAT I PAID FOR! i learned my lesson no more new unknown brands. i will rate this product as the poorest product i've ever bought."
3,"Interesting conjecture at places, but a bit too dry and repeative.","Susan Ackerman's study of the book of Judges in a feminist light does offer some interesting angles on the familiar(Samson) and the not-so familiar(the shrewd wife that managed the land well). But most of this book was just dry, dense academia that did not capture me. The literary equivilent of fiber; good to read, hard to digest."
2,Poetry To Remenber,"This Translation of one of the greatest works of world literature is not as good as the Robert Fagles translation, which I ratr Five star."
3,Help,Can somebody write a review of this DVD for me? I am a Muppet fan but only like the best of the best. I have been back here many times to check for reviews but have none. It would be much appreciated.Thank You.
1,Yuck,"It's nothing great, not even good. It reeks so if you use it on laundry, you may have to wash twice to get the pungent orange stink out. Didn't work on old stains. Save your money, don't buy this. --disappointed Minnesota Mom"
5,starman,This is a wonderful video.. the quality of the video is fantastic!!this series is a good video for kids and adults........there are actually morals involved with a great sense of fun.I recommend this for anyone Enjoy
3,excellent but,"Excellent series but the disks keep freezing which takes all the joy out of watching this wonderful series. They need to use better disks when making these considering how long it takes them to make them after they are ordered. My brother gave them to me as a present and I was so very excited. The first episode was perfect and all my fond memories of this series returned. But then, beginning with episode two, at the very beginning even, it started with the trouble spots. So much sadness."
3,Bseball Cap Backing,"Good quality product, as with most Rothco products. However, the rear of this hat has the adjustable ""baseball hat"" plastic snaps. Not what I was looking for. I am returning because of this reason."
3,might have been good if I had received it,Can't say anything about it as I ordered this in April through Amazon/purpleturtle for a group study. We are now finishing up the study and still nothing received. Had to put in some stars to get this posted
4,A GREAT CD!!,OK.This Cd is great.I'm used to listening to classic rock and playing it also.What I really love about classic rock is the solos.This Cd is great.It has great tunes but what it misses is more solos.Maybe this is because crispian mills is not much of a soloist but he is a great riff writer.
3,Her books have been better,"I usually love her books, but this book was missing her magic. It was an okay read for me. I could not get into their romance. I usually can't put her book down, but I could not get engrossed into this one."
1,Longest book ever,"I bought this book because it had good reviews. This book was horrible. It took me forever to read and it rambled. I actually skipped groups of pages and didn't appear to miss anything. I only finished the book on principle- because I bought it and didn't want to waste my money. In my opinion, this is just a BAD book."
5,My Favorite Love Story,This is one of the few novels that has made me weep. Scott Spencer tells this story in such a way that I actually felt David's emotions. Achingly beautiful.
5,By far the best book on flight attendants I've ever seen.,"The first of what we can now call flight attendants were hired in 1926 by Stout Airlines for it's Detroit to Grand Rapids route. From that modest beginning, the occupation has evolved thanks to increased passenger traffic, worldwide routes, larger and more complex planes, greater services, and the influence of labor unions. This book is truly a ""Bible"" of the field, providing everything from the history of the occupation to details on hiring and employment practices. It lists contact and employment information for approximately 100 US and Canadian carriers. By far the best book on flight attendants I've ever seen."
5,A must-read for those aspiring to become flight attendants!,"The Flight Attendant Job Finder and Career Guide, by Tim Kirkwood, is by far the best source for career information on the in-flight service profession. Drawing on his 23 years as a flight attendant, Tim Kirkwood accurately describes every aspect of in-flight service, including what to expect on a typical three-day trip. The Guide also features a directory of all US and Canadian airlines, complete with job requirements and contact information for each company. A must-read for those aspiring to become flight attendants! --Helen E. McLaughlin, author of WALKING ON AIR and FOOTSTEPS IN THE SKY"
3,Not enough information,There could be a lot more information in this book for the price. It didn't really give that much advice. I was disappointed. For an excellent book on the subject try the one written by Luanna Rule.
1,Not as pictured or described.,"The product description & photo imply that it is a set of 4 pens in assorted colors. Be warned, it is only one pen and you do not get to choose the color. Pen itself is kind of flimsy. $7.99 for 4 pens would have been reasonable. $7.99 plus shipping for 1 flimsy, plastic pen is not worth it."
4,Pretty good.,"If you own Warrior is a Child and Keepin My Eyes on You, you do not need these cds. There are 24 songs of which 21 come from those 2 albums and 3 from her first release. I don't have those so for me was a good buy."
1,Possibly the worst textbook ever,The author tries to teach both Analog and Digital signal processing. He really teaches neither. I am using this book in a class where the tests are based on the homework and I can't even check my answers because none are given. The examples are difficult to understand and do not resemble the end of chapter problems. I am currently looking into some kind of reference to help through the class.
1,Waste of time and money,"As a youngster, I thought that ""if you can find it in a book,it's gotta be true.""This is probably the hope maintained by the author and others who fancy themselves as ""Holocaust Revisionists.""Their ultimate goal is to portray nazi Germany in a more positive light than the historical record establishes.To do so,they invariably resort to half truths,non-truths,and plain old ""whoppers."" There are also some people around who believe that Elvis is still alive,the astronauts never really landed on the moon, or that former president,Bill Clinton is a space alien. You can put this book in the same category.Serious readers may want to spend their hard-earned cash elsewhere."
3,Cool 3d but to short,I think the 3d is amazing and I wonder why anyone would by a 3D tv when you could get 3D dvd's and play them on any TV. My one complaint would be this is to short and should be a full length feature
4,Good Ghostbusters giftset,"The two GB movies look very good, good bonus features like extra GB cartoons,cards,slime,statue looks like it could break very easy so keep it away from the little ones and u have to keep the slime in a cool place or it will evaporate quickly.but overall good giftset."
4,A wonderful book that changes one's outlook in life,"To kill a Mocking bird is a book that should be read by everyone. This book is about humanity at its best and at its worst. I enjoyed the adventures of Scout, Jem & Dill. Alas this kind of childhood is lost for the TV viewing kids of today."
3,mom of 7,"This is cute and also funny for awhile, I would not buy again. Just for the fact that its short lived and now what to do with it."
5,Little chillers,"Great product for any liquid. Efficiently preforms as promised. Especially good for any beverage you don't want to dilute, such as wine or a mixed drink. Highly recommended."
2,"Great idea, but can cause drinks to taste bad...","I've had these for over a year and they worked great for awhile, but lately I've noticed a taste of rotten eggs when using them in certain drinks. At first it happened with Sprite, but now I can taste it in coffee as well. Not sure what's causing this, might be the plastic or the liquid within but I stopped using them after this happened more than once."
4,"Looks great, works great","This timer has an nice, effective ringer. The size is perfect for either standing out on my counter top or slipped in the cupboard. It's cute to boot."
5,Fanstastic!,This is a wonderful account from a World War II soldier of his medical experience in the war. He does a great job of relaying the conditions in which he lived and fought during that time and the lessons learned. A GREAT read!!
5,Careful By The Motels,"Why the Hell are so many great records, like this one, unavailible on CD? I bought this on vinyl when it was new. I was already a Motels fan. This album, while a little different and less avante garde than the first, totally kicks as none the less!It is a little less guitar oriented than the first album but the songs are unique, hook laden, and catchy. Of course, I don't have to tell you that Martha Davis voice is as beautiful and haunting as ever. If you are a fan of the Motels and have missed out on this gem, GET IT IF YOU CAN!! Why this great band didn't stay huge after their 3rd album is a mystery to me."
2,Great CD even when scratch to hell,"This review would be a 1 star if not for the music on the CD but the product I received was super scratched, I only paid 3 dollar for it though. If your a WU fan and don't have this. I highly recommend it."
1,Ninja folding grappling Hook,"I would like to have known more about the limitations for the use of the grappling hook. We used the hook to pull hay bales off the top of a full squeeze of hay (88 bales) to put into a storage area. It did what we wanted it to do, but it's structure wasn't strong enough to hold up to continued use, the hook bars at the center pole have a groove which I feel weakens the strength and durability of the unit. It bent and we could no longer use it, we are having it welded solid to see if we can continue to use it."
5,I'm very happy with it!!!!,"Very good item. It comes in two pieces I attached the hook to the rope using an anchor knot and it has held my weight. It's an awesome product that i strongly recommend to all that have ever wanted one or just want something in your room that starts conversations with: ""Do you know why I love you?"" (pointing to grappling hook)."
2,Rope too stiff.,"Tying the rope in knots is difficult. Grapple seems strange with the bolt too high on the hilt, maybe it changes with use."
3,Good,Its a pretty good grappling hook. I thought the hook would have been a bigger size. That's the downside here. It's just not that big. The rope is very durable and great length. Holds together fairly nice. Just wish it was bigger to hook into those items or branches.
1,Bad product-bad seller,The product broke almost immediately. Soft steel? I do not know why it broke but I am very happy I was not at any height when it did.I contacted the seller-3 times-no response.Too bad-you are on your own if you deal with these people.Stay Away!
3,"a starter book, but a bit thin","Not a bad book for a starter into the topic, but it's fairly thin on details, and some of the ideas contained within do run counter to ideas found elsewhere. If you're looking for a basic book on Mason Bees, I'd suggest the one by Brian Griffin instead, which gives a bit more detail while being eminently more readable."
3,OK COLOGNE,THIS COLOGNE IS OK BUT I SMELLED A BETTER VERSION OF IT.MAYBE I GOT A WATERED DOWN VERSION.SEEMS LIKE IT.G
2,"Rave reviews, ok product.","Bought this from amazon after seeing the rave reviews. I used to go with Armani Gio and have had positive reviews on that for long. Decided to try Cool Water from Davidoff for a change. The scent here is sublime and smooth, but it often fades away in a couple of hours. In my opinion, this is nowhere close to Gio. For cool water the best comment I got was something involving clean, new laundry!?!! ha!"
1,DAVIDOFF COOL WATER MENS COLOGNE IS WHAT I WANT TO ORDER,I have already given my review of this product and also how disappointed I am about not getting what I ordered. The labeling on the bottles must be better. I ordered cologne and got natural spray. I took the information from the current bottle of cologne I have and matched it with one of the bottles. When it arrived it was natural spray and not cologne.....I am trying to JUST GET COLOGNE ......PLEASE HELP WITH GETTING WHAT I ORDERED. IT WAS LIKE SOMEONE CHANGED MY ORDER AFTER I CLICKED ON WHAT I THOUGHT WAS COLOGNE.....Davidoff Cool Water cologne is all I want to order.I GAVE MY OPINION THE OTHER DAY TO AMAZON AND THE SELLER OF THE PRODUCT I WAS TRYING TO BUY...
2,smells like alcohol,"smells like alcohol, as a faint smell of something other than Cool water that wears of in 20mins, stick to store purchases."
5,Cool Water - Excellent price,Excellent price $32.50 and free shipping too. This product retails for $61.00......Fast (USPS priority) delivery even in Hawaii. Usually other companies offer free shipping but not to Hawaii/Alaska and offer only in the continential U.S. Love It!!!!!
3,Smells good; but doesn't last long,"I can put the stuff on before leaving in the morning, and by the time I get to work, the scent is barely detectable. I'll keep using it until it runs out though."
4,Good Deal,This product is good for the price. At stores they are at least $10 more than compared to the prices here.
3,Disappointment,I was somewhat disappointed by the size of the flask the image on the page gave me a different impression.Other wise the contents is very good as always.
2,It's not the real thing,"This is not the real product. The scent / smell lasts for an hour or less. No wonder it was so cheap. Amazon should not be selling these types of products (fake, imitations, etc)"
5,good buy,"first seen and I was unsure about buying, finally gave in an ordered, I was skeptical at first but smells exactly like dept store cool water.I would recommend and purchase again.Received item promptly, cant beat amazons price anywhere!"
5,The Ladies Love It,I have to stop giving my bottles away. Gave the first bottle to my son. the second bottle went to the step-son... Hopefully I'll get to keep this one... Smells Great...
5,Number One Gun outdid themselves,"I knew it was going to be good. As good as the debut ""Celebrate Mistakes"" was, I knew that this cd was going to be great music...I could not have imagined it would be like this though. It is very different, much more energetic and upbeat than their previous album. I say buy both, they are both great in their own ways. But if you are only going to buy one, buy this amazing new album that deserves to be at the top of the charts."
1,Difficult to remove muffin/brownie/cake from the pan,"Got this pan a few months agoand was very excited about using it.However, each time I use it to make mini-muffins,mini-brownies, or other miniature cakes,they always stick to the bottom of the panand it is extremely difficult to take them outwithout damaging the muffin, brownie, or cake.Quite of frustrating actuallyand kind of regretted getting 2 of theminstead of trying 1 out first.Would not recommend this pan...too bad I cannot get a refund for these."
5,great quality and economical,"For the amount of time these saved me, I am grateful! Wonderful quality and makes 24 perfect mini-cupcakes instantly with ease. I can't stop using these pans!"
4,Good pan,"This product came damaged with part of the non stick surface peeling off. Because of this I was severely alarmed so when I used the pan I greases it with lard and dusted with flour, it was perfect! The muffins popped out with no problems at all! I love it."
5,"BAKER""S SECRET MINI_MUFFIN PANS ARE GREAT",I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE PANS and THE SPEEDY DELIVERY TIME. BEST OF ALL I WAS ABLE TO SAVE A LOT OF MONEY; THE SAME PRODUCT IN A STORE WHERE I LIVE WOULD HAVE COST ME TWICE AS MUCH.
2,Squashed muffin papers,"These pans are decent weight and bake fine but they are deeper than other standard mini muffin pans. Because of this the bottoms are narrower and standard mini muffin papers don't go all the way in to rest on the bottoms. This causes the cakes to come out kind of squashed looking with not quite flat bottoms. If you don't use paper liners, I suppose these pans will work fine for you. If you do, I recommend trying the ""Wilton Recipe Right 24 Cup Mini Muffin Pan"" for just about a dollar more, it has the same diameter at the top of the cups but is not quite as deep."
4,FOUND PERFECT BAKING CUPS FOR THIS PAN!!!,"I noticed on the reviews that many had trouble finding baking cups that fit this pan correctly. Well I just rcv'd mine in the mail and they fit PERFECTLY! I only gave 4 starts because I haven't used it yet but will update in the next few days after using. THESE ARE THE BAKING CUPS I ORDERED: NORPRO 3590 MINI BAKING CUPSNorpro 3590 Mini Baking Cups, 100-Count, White"
5,"Easy to make, delicious to eat","I've been a fan of High Mountain's jerky seasonings for some time now. I've tried quite a few different types, and I always come back to High Mountain and the original recipe is my favorite of their line. Salty and not too sweet, I use it mainly on venison and occasionally beef. This blend has almost a bacon-like taste. Complete, easy-to-follow instructions are included."
3,SO SO,OK but does not do justice to the book. Way to much left out. Should have been a Mini Series like Shogun or Noble house.
1,Probably the worst movie I've ever seen...,"I remember seeing the 12 or so hour miniseries of ""Shogun"" many years ago. I loved it, read the book and loved it, so when I saw ""Tai Pan"", I figured it'd live up to the standard of Shogun. I could not have been more wrong. This is a meandering, confusing mess which seems to relish pointless violence against women. I have never read the book, but I plan on doing so, simply so that I can figure out what the movie was attempting to convey. There are very, very, very few movies I actually hate. This undoubtedly was one of them."
4,Another in the classic Clavell stories,"Though not at the level of Shogun or Noble House, this movie is a good telling of Taipan. Just as the book was not as easy to read, due to the heavy Scottish dialect in which it speaks, this movie seems more difficult to follow as well. There seems to be a rush to introduce the characters, who parts don't 'flesh out'. A lot of the book seems to be lost, as little explanation is given to some of the characters more bizarre behavior.I did enjoy this movie, because I read the book first and could mentally fill in the gaps in the characters' stories. However, this movie does not compare well to the other books and their movie counterparts in this oriental series by the great writer, James Clavell. Perhaps, it needed to be longer to truly tell the tale...or maybe not."
3,Better Second Time Around. Keep Trying...,"Okay, so I'm a James Clavell fan and a fan of Bryan Brown since his ""Alice Springs"" days, and granted this remake is far better a screen adaption than the typhoon with Patrick McGoohan of some years back. Production quality and finer drawn characters of Struan, and his ""Supreme Lady,"" MaiMai, and Brock do flesh out the film on the origins of Hong Kong, yet it still lacks the complexity that even the most minor characters, the intrique and convoluted plot of perhaps Clavell's best novel, the first in his series of Noble House. Try again, folks. This novel deserves the full treatment of ""Shogun"" and ""King Rat"". (Nice to see Kyra Sedgwick, even if she has too few lines.)"
4,Works Great,The expandable two line phone solved all our phone problems. It has been very reliable and I have added to the system so we now have four phones plus the base. A good buy.
5,WONDERFUL HANK PENNY RHYTHM,"I am a friend of Hank's widow through a mutual friend and have seen Hank and Shari's daughter, Syd, grow up through pictures via the family friend. Hank's music is alway brought up and I've heard clips of his music, and was attracted to this album after listening to samples. I am so pleased to have purchased this album as it brinks Hank back to life. His song, Little Red Wagon, is a classic which should be played today, and surely is a legacy for his new grandson. This is an easy listening CD and is much enjoyed. Dennis Stiffler, Bremerton, WA"
3,So Far,"When I purchased this item I was lead to believe that it would work in my 2005 Honda Civic, however it does not include the cable that connects to the factory radio. So if you are going to purchase this item make sure you order the unit designed specifically for your vehicle! I have not installed it yet to see how it works because I have to find a cable for it, so more later."
1,Great resource for starters,I found this book easy to read and understand. It patiently lays out various elements of getting published. It is very useful as a starter guide to beginning writers such as myself.
5,Very impressed.,I can't say enough great things about this book. Superior and complete. Thorough in a way no other writers are. It feels like he truly cares deeply about what goes into his works. I truly hope he continues to provide us with more works.
4,Absorbtion is amazing,I use these as overnight protection. It has a very slim design yet the quantity of absorbtion is amazing and is sufficient for overnight use.
5,Excellent concise overview of neglected topic,"This is one of the better Ospreys that I have read, and the author should be congratulated for presenting a concise and entertaining narrative on a neglected topic (30 Years War). The modern photographs and contemporary line drawings are excellent, and they blend in well with the text.Brzezinski should also be commended for presenting a more balanced view of Gustavus Adolphus, who was certainly one of history's great leaders, but he didn't do everything. Several popular myths surrounding the Swedish king are challenged in a logical and non-confrontational fashion.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and now you can too - Osprey just issued a special edition to bring this title back into print. Whether you're a novice or expert on this fascinating period of history, this is a very worthwhile purchase."
1,Poor Quality & Uncomfortable,"I bought these slippers because they looked decent online and the couple reviews listed were all positive. I will never buy slippers online again because of them. They had next to no padding so they were very uncomfortable. The sides were almost rigid instead of soft and worst of all, mine completely fell apart within a month and a half. I only use them at my carpeted office at work and never wore them outside. To me they were horrible. If you do get them, I hope you have better luck."
4,Nice slipper,took a while to get here but my husband liked them well enough thought the color was a bit bright but quality made
1,"NOT BLACK, ITS DARK BROWN!",It may go with wood color cabinets but looks horrible in black ash speakers. It is ugly. The worst part is that is sold as black!
5,Mary Lorson steps out into the light,"Fans of the group Madder Rose will be delighted with the intoxicating mood of this CD. Mary Lorson makes this album her own with her sultry vocals and delivery. The stands out tracks are ""Crash"" and ""Walk on By"". Saint Low is a pure pleasure without any thorns."
4,New interpretations on old school classics...,"When I first heard that this CD was coming out, I really didn't think that I would be too impressed. After buying this CD, I have to say that this is one of the best remake albums I have heard in years. I really have to give shouts out to Will Downing, Brian McKnight,Kenny Latimore and Joe...I can't help but putting the songs they performed on repeat. Erykah Badu and D'Angelo also do a spectacular job on this album. I didn't even know that was John B singing your precious love. This is a CD that you definitely want to have in your collection!!!"
2,only lasted for 2 days,"I thought it was nice at first, but my dog was able to remove it in only 2 days. Of course, he chewed it off and now it's gone."
5,"Sizing a problem, but a great collar","If your dog has 'stinky collar syndrome', this is the answer! Our dog, a six year old Golden, had smelled so bad for so long that we thought it was her. It turned out to be her collars after they had gotten wet from her frequent swims. This is the only collar we've ever tried that after two months and many swims later, has no smell whatsoever! The collar is holding up perfectly and the functionality of the 'Fido' tag doesn't concern me. Unfortunately, there is a definite glitch with sizing on these collars. For some reason, there are gaps between the sizes. When our dog's 16 1/2"" neck size wasn't covered in their sizing chart, Teafco's customer service suggested ordering a large and it wasn't even close to fitting. So we ordered a medium and it barely fit. Get past the sizing issue and this is a great collar!"
4,Yup,Supplement to high-end pc. Sony makes quality products. I own this and a PSP and both are high quality hardware.
3,Waiting for new games to come out. . .,"I was lucky enough to be able to get a Ps3 and a Wii. The PS3 was for my husband and the Wii was for me. I'm not going to go into a very complicated technical review of the console because you can get that from the other reviews as well as the product description. What I will say is that I don't think I have been able to fully enjoy everything that the PS3 has to offer and I can't wait for some new games to come out in march 07 - like the new Hot Shots Golf.So far, Resistance Fall of Man has been getting a lot of play. So much so that he has completed the game in all 3 levels and is playing it again in the Expert Level. I'll review that game - because it's good.Perhaps I'll come back and edit this review when some newer games come out and I spend more time playing it because right now, if I had to chose, I would definately chose the Wii over the PS3 based on cost, fun, and ease of game play."
3,Not quite there yet,"I for one was looking forward to the PS3 with the promise of many great titles from the PS2 generation makign the jump. The price is a major turn off. Not to mention, that one must purchase an HD TV to fully enjoy the visuals. That's ridiculous.The one killer-app for the system is Resistance: Fall of Man. I've played it and its just another FPS. Nothing ground-breaking. Its just a solid game. Does it justify having to take out some sort of loan to acquire the necessary equipment (PS 3 and TV)? I certainly think not.In time though I am confident the PS3 will pan out. I would recommend people give it some time. By then the price of the system and HD TV sets will drop."
4,its a really good system...so far,over all the PS3 is a wonderful unit. sony has to just fix some minor problems and fast!! let us access our PSN while playing a game damn you! also im alil mad about some PS2 games not looking up to snuff on the thing. though some look great (and i mean GRRRRREAT!) like burnout revenge others like ffxii look like trash.
1,FUN!!,"PS3 is so fun! it has the best graphics, its also a blu-ray player, and it has lot of good games! BUY THIS!!"
2,crashed after only a year,"came home one day after owning my 60 GB, crashed, no red light, nothing have since owned a 40 GB, upgraded the hard drive to 250 gb, and love it, its not worth the headache of having a PS2 inside it. From what I have read on Sony website forum and reviews this is one of the reason they stopped making the 60 GB, seems like they tried to cram to much into the 60 GB version. if you read the fine print on the warranty even on the new PS3's there is only a 1 year warranty, had mine almost two years, the only one that actually lasted the longest was the 20gb, which was my first PS3 when they first came out had over 2 years, and loved it. Had the 4 usb inputs and ps2 built inside it, seems like the newer ps3's are running much better. Which is def. a good thing."
3,Not a gaming machine,"well to start off I am really dissapointed in the PS3 as a gaming machine. I only use it for bluray and it works great for that so that's why it got three stars. But Sony will not release any games because it is more interested in the HDM format war. So here's to Sony for scrwing me the PS gamer. I only game on my 360, which at first I didn't want to buy. I only wanted the PS3. Now I am thankful MS does think about the gamer."
4,"Not bad, but room for improvement","I bought the PS3 60GB from Amazon two weeks ago. It set up really easy, and the wireless connection is great. I bought COD3 and it is a great. The graphics are nice, but I wish the frame rates were a little faster. I don't think this is a limitation of the PS3 though, probably just a game issue. I haven't had any overheating problems that some others have have reported, but I have the system in a well ventilated area. If I could I would have given it 3.5 stars. I think the system as a huge amount of potential, but doesn't have a lot of games out now. I don't regret buying it, but in all honesty if I knew then what I know now I could have waited 6months for more titles to be released, and any bugs worked out. The worst parts of the system are no included HDMI cable. I didn't realize that, and had to wait to see the HD graphics until I bought one. The price tag is steep at $600. I would probably feel better about the purchase if it was half the price."
4,Two Words: Region Free,"Rather than extol the numerous virtues (and complaints) having already been expressed by other PS3 owners, I thought I'd mention a single great fact about the PS3:It is competely region free, and there are no region restrictions on imported games. Obviously issues will still arise if you attempt to play PAL games on a NTSC system, and vice versa. But for a long time importer like myself, this is a great way to instantly expand the title library of your PS3, without ever having to bother with modding or even buying an imported system model."
4,The older PS3's are better.,The new 40GB and 80GB PS3 have removed the chips that provide backwards-compatibility with PS1 and PS2 games. They run older games using software emulation which is not the same. The new PS3's also use a proprietary disk drive - unlike the older PS3's that use a SATA disk drive. My suggestion is to buy a 20GB original PS3 and a Seagate Maximus 160GB HDD at 1 1/2 time faster speed. The total cost is about the same as the new 80GB PS3 and you have better hardware with twice the disk space
2,PS3 is now on Clearance. Get it now or wait for another price drop,"It's official, 8 months after launching the 20GB and 60GB PS3's are both discontinued. The 60GB is now on clearance while supplies last.Sony has stated that the 60GB models are no longer in production and once they run out, they will only have their more expensive $600 model (same as the current one but with an 80GB drive instead of a 60GB drive)."
2,So far not great.,"I bought the PS3 for a Blu ray player. Out of the box my PS3 makes such a bad whining noise I could not bare it. There are quite a few people on posting boards with the same issue. It is not the fan, but the actual processors. I am sending it back to Sony for repair, but they are sending me a refurbished PS3 in return. Not happy about this at all. I did not drop down $500 for a refurbished system."
4,PS3 60GB still the best today!,"If you're in the market for a playstation 3, I highly recommend looking into getting an original 60GB model, the best out there! It seems that Sony continues to remove more and more features from the newer models as where the 60GB had it all. Full hardware backwards compatibility with all your PS2 games (some of them still have active online communities) 4 usb slots (the new ""slim"" models only have two) and memory card readers. The new PS3's have removed so much since the original launch.If you find yourself running out of hard drive space, you can easily upgrade it to a 500GB (they are $54.99 on amazon brand new) to give you plenty of storage room for all your games and movies.As someone with a big collection of original playstation and playstation 2 games, buying a 60GB PS3 was one of the best purchases I've made."
1,"Won't upconvert 720p Games to 1080i - no 720p on your TV, no HD on your PS3","For those of us with an HDTV that is 3 years old or so (you know, the early adopters who paid a lot for their HDTVs). Sony's PS3 lacks a scaler to upconvert the signals. So if you buy a game like Resistance which outputs at 720p, you're stuck playing it in non HD, 480p. That's right, rather than scale the game up to 1080i, it downgrades it to no HD. This is unacceptable, the 360 has a bit in upscaler, my cablebox has a built in upscaler, it's not new or expensive technology - why did sony cheap out on this? If I want to play non HD games I would have bought a Wii. Sony cut one to many corners here - so look or an open, but otherwise perfect PS3 on ebay.Maybe the can fix this in firmware, but I don't know. For the time being I'll just cash out on eBay and buy it back when and IF they fix this glaring problem"
1,What a EXPENSIVE Piece of Garbage.,"Well the graphics are nice, I aint gonna lie. But for 600 Bucks I expect a little bang for my buck. Only thing that I found was that alot of my PS2 Games will not work with the system. This really sucks. Another thing that I noticed is that after a little while of playing, BOY doesn't this thing get hot. Seems like it is cookin itself right there on the entertainment system. I am going to see if they will let me take it back. What a piece of junk. Stay with the PS2 or the Xbox for a while and let the idiots work out the kinks."
1,Done with Sony,"Invested a lot on this generation. Was not a fan of the war with pirates with removal of features and constant upgrades. My 60gb fat yellow ringed just out of warranty and cost a fair amount to fix. Some half baked attempts (browser, home...) and little move support.This generation is over but had to put 2 cents in. PC gaming for the next bit, sony not likely first choice next go round."
1,Um...,"I was SO disappointed in this book! I never even got to read it! I downloaded it once and got a couple chapters in, when the book suddenly would not turn the page any more and had all this gibberish on my Kindle screen that did NOT look like legible letters. I called Amazon and was instructed to delete it and re-download. The same thing happened on the second trial! By that time, I was so fed up with spending money on the Kindle version of this book that I didn't even want to deal with it. To this day, I still have not gotten to read it."
5,Fires in the Bathroom,"This is a pretty insightful book. Some of the opinions of the students were a little surprising. I think it's a good book for future teachers to read, it reminds you to see things from a student's perspective."
1,Poorly written,"I was in the mood for some light romance reading, and after seeing all the great reviews for this book, though I'd buy it, especially since it's set in the general area in which I live. I was hugely disappointed.I couldn't connect with this book at all. The prose was awkward, which made it difficult to get into the story. The happy little start--widow finds handsome doctor first day back in the house--was not at all believable and story development was equally implausible. I don't get the glowing reviews--for me this one was a big bust."
5,A reader from Tennessee,"I really enjoyed The Beach House. So many novels dwell on the younger relationships. Sometimes we fail to reaze relationships can last through thick and thin just like Joe and Maggie. I thought that was wonderful how they tied the three families together. I heard a song ""Grow Old With Me"" not long ago, and that came to mind when I came to the month of July and Joe and Maggie. This is the first book I have read by Georgia Bockoven, but I plan to read more."
2,Ripples (A story of Garth Brooks),"Although I found the characters in the story of Madeline and Ryan to be very interesting, I was disappointed in the story because I did not find it believable. I am very interested in this subject and have read many many books about past live regressions. In each previous experience, it seemed like the memories were like jig saw puzzles where the party was trying to put the fragments of their past lives together and make sense out of their recalls. Never have I encountered in any of my other readings, including Edgar Cayce (who was the lst and best, in my opinion) did the subject recall entire lives from start to finish with every little innuendo in between. Ms. Smedley is asking us to believe that she recalled entire dialogue with her past love from 300 years ago over a span of many years, as well as that of other members of the family, including their thoughts and feelings at the time. I find that a stretch of imagine, to say mildly."
1,Crackpot fantasy,"Oh it's an uplifting tale, with love and magic, but the author actually believes it happened. She's insane. Go ahead and read the book, but just know your money will be going to someone who's crazy and uses her psychotic ideas to make a bundle of money. Poor Garth Brooks must be freaked out by such a weirdo."
2,Many Broken,"When my cases arrived, the parts that hold each case closed on many of the cases were broken off. The cases are not well made."
4,MODERN MIITARY AIRCRAFT,"First I am a builder of 1/144 th scale model aircraft. This book has been a great aid to that purpose. The book was printed in 2004, and a number of the aircraft reviewed have ""retired""; IE the American Tomcat and the British Jaguar. Still it was a bargain, and well worth the cost."
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad","If I could give this book no stars I would. It did neither Christianity nor Buddhism justice, as if Christ or Buddha would ever be reduced to some sort of competition to ""save"" a prostitute. I was very disappointed with this book. Although this book was written biased toward Christianity, it was obvious that Ravi Zacharias doesn't have a thorough knowledge of either Buddhism or Christianity. It was an interesting idea-horribly executed. If you are interested in knowing more about Buddhism or similarities and differences between Christianity and Buddhism read Thich nhat Hanh or books by HH the Dalai Lama."
1,One Closed Mind,"This book has nothing to do with Buddhism, it's intended as polemic against Buddhists and Buddhism. I could write a book about Christ and put words in his mouth to make him seem foolish but that would have nothing to do with what he taught!!"
1,A deeply dishonest book,"Zacharias plays the puppet-master, manipulating his Buddha and Jesus characters to reach his own predetermined conclusion. He is neither fair nor honest in his depiction of the imaginery dialogues, misrepresenting Buddhism and giving a merely conventional depiction of Christianity that omits any hint from contemporary scholarship about the questionable authorship and authenticity of many biblical passages. Buddhists who read this book will not recognize the Buddha they know, while Christians will be deceived. Zacharias should do long penance for writing this tendentious piece of propaganda."
