5,Honeywell Oscillating Fan,"This is a great fan! It's a little loud on its highest speed. But it has great airflow, and it cools down a room really fast."
3,Great Value...A Tad Loud for the Bedroom,"This is a great buy if you're using the fan for anything other than to drown out noise in the bedroom which is what I wanted to do. Turns out that, on the lowest setting, it's a tad louder than I need it to be.At the end of the day, if you're a heavy sleeper or if your buying this for another purpose, it's a great product."
4,Great fan.,"This is a very nice fan, my only problem with it is the lack of downward pivotting, so you have to have it on a comparable level to where you want the airflow (or lower than the level of course). I wanted a loud fan to help drown out annoying apartment noises and it does just that."
3,a so-so book about an extraordinary company,"This book provides some interesting and many uninteresting details about Intel's history. Though well-researched, it is of little educational value and reads more like a soap opera. Worst of all, unlike what the title would suggest, the book discusses Andy Grove very little and provides few insights into the reasons for success of Intel. In fact, much of the book is dedicated to Intel's petty & vindictive spats with former employees."
4,This book is a must for every computer user!,"This book is a relative recent release. As the title suggests it is about Andy Grove and Intel, but also about the whole computer industry. It is very well-written and as enjoyable as just a fiction could be. Intel is undoubtedly the leading microprocessor-maker and this book gives the answer why it is so. Motto : Don't let your employees do to you what you did to your former boss."
3,Yosemite,"I like it ok but it came with the case semi-broken and loose plastic pieces falling out. I bought it because of the ""Wilderness Trail"" piece but some of the others are just ok."
3,Irresistable is much better,"The second one in this series is much better. However, one should read Scandalous so they have the background information on all the characters. This was a good read, but will not leave a lasting impression."
2,Not up to par,"I am a die-hard Karen Robards fan, and that's why I was so disappointed with this latest effort from the author. Several of the romantic scenes in ""Scandalous"" were copied straight out of her earlier contemporary novels. The dialogue between key characters often seemed unnatural and forced. The heroine was refreshing in that she made up for her ordinary looks with an extrodinary strength of spirit, but the hero didn't seem worthy of her somehow, being too shallow and lacking in character overall. Ms. Robard's has a flair for writing contemporary novels with a sharp, quick dialogue in today's language. If you're looking for a fast-paced romance with a heroine and hero you can root for, I'd recommend Ms. Robards' ""Hunter's Moon""."
5,Review of Dr. Fehr's Introduction to Group Therapy Book,"I have just finished reading Dr. Fehr's wonderful book on group therapy. It is appropriate for both the beginning group therapist, the seasoned group therapist, and even for the group therapy client who wishes to know more about this effective treatment modality.Dr. Fehr has written an excellent book which enriches both one's need for intellectual stimulation and one's need for emotionality. I personally found his book to be effective on both the intellectual and the emotional levels.I highly recommend this book and plan to use it with all the practicum students and interns who train at my clinical training site."
2,"Build is OK, but finish is not","I ordered one of these for a kitchen desk. They are a relatively heavy build for a windsor bowback chair. Not like some of the very expensive ones with relatively thin elegant lines, more heavy and sturdy and looks built to be used. So what I liked is it looks like it will hold up from a structural perspective under normal kitchen use and has in our kitchen.I would have rated it 5 stars for the price and quality, except the problem I experienced is the finish is flaking off the seat after a few months out of the box. Could be unique to my chair. It looks like there were multiple coats of finish and the last coat did not adhere properly to the prior. So at least what is underneath the flakes matches in color. I thought of sending it back but unfortunately it was just not a priority since it does not show much unless you look for it. Of course I have to sweep up the occassional black paint chips off the floor."
5,Excellent!,"The price was perfect from Kenneth Cole $265.00, Amazon $85.00. You do the math! Thank You Amazon!"
5,Awesome!,This book is very insightful and uplifting! I would encourage anyone to read this book it offers a lot of valid information.
2,It has too much cholesterol.,"Tastes great, but it has ten times more cholesterol than other meal replacements. I contacted the manufacturer to find out why it has 150mg of cholesterol, but they never responded. Compare labels and buy a brand that won't clog your arteries."
5,Does the job,Enjoyed using the product easy and effective.... if reusing bottles I suggest Sam Adams and NO TWIST CAPS I spent like $7 and got caps and it all worked out awesome enjoy
5,Awesome product,"This capper is better than the first one I bought. The construction is solid and it is as easy as 1-2-3. So far I've bottled 8 cases of homebrew and no problems with this product. Good price and quality, shipping was quick. Thank you!"
3,Not great the other 2 were better...,"Like the first reviewer said this one seems alot more rushed than the other 2. The T.I. VS Lil' Flip part was probably the best one as it actually had both people's sides of the story. The ""50/ Bang Em' Smurf ; Game"" parts don't show 50's side at all also the 50 VS Game part is out-of-date since they said they had sqaushed it when they're still beefing now. And then there's Lil' Scrappy vs The Cops?!.... Come on that's not even a beef. Twista VS Bone Thugs (they had beef?) was kinda boring. Although DJ Kay Slay is a pretty good narrator I liked the other guy alot better. The extras are pretty nice especailly footage from Game's infamous performance at Summer Jam."
5,Compact fast charger.,Simple design. Fast charger. Bought as an extra charger as I have 2 drills. Works great.
4,OK,"The ball is a heavy rubber basketball. It seems to be approximately official size (I didn't actually measure it). It came fully inflated. I just opened the box and started shooting. It was easy to get out of the box.I wanted a cheap basketball because my kids usually lose a ball before it goes flat. I think this ball will last long enough to get lost. Maybe a year or two. It's clearly not the best quality, but it's better than some really cheap balls that fell like plastic."
3,Papads good; Amazon description BAD!,"7.06-Ounce Pack (Pack of 20). I didn't realize that ""Pack of 20"" meant a whole case (20) of 7.06-ounce packs! It didn't mean 20 per pack. I ended up with almost ten pounds of papadams! Unless you're an Indian restaurant, or a very large family that eats these all the time, don't order these."
2,Flash 4 for Windows -NOT VERY GOOD!,"I bought this book, with some prior knowledge of Flash. If you feel like reading the book page-by-page, then buy it! I was looking for more of a reference source that I could turn to, to get info or how to accomplish something or what certain features do. This book is based on previous chapters, meaning that if you skip a chapter you LOST! Each new chapter makes references to prior chapters, such as, ""See chapt 4."" Overall, I am disappointed with the book, although is does collect dust nicely!"
2,Too simple,"I found this book too simple. It spend too much pages to show you this window menu and that window menu. It is good for those who don't know Flash at all but also want to learn it slowly.If you already know a bit of Flash 3; or have the original version 3 or 4 manual; or know a bit about computer graphics, you probably want a more comprehensive guide other than this one."
2,RTFM - and save twelve bucks!,"If you need your info fluffy and pretty, here's your book, but it was cotton-candy to my hunger for bread and meat. I read the whole thing in the Border's parking lot, went back in and exchanged it for some remaindered cookbooks."
3,Okay,"Received item quickly-thank you. These cards are great for adults but not so much kids. There is no order to the cards by way of categories and all the cards are the same color. Also they are very thin. I am trying to review my spanish so they will work fine, but as I said I think they are too thin for kids and maybe wouldn't hold up as well."
1,didn't work,the cables I received did not work. I sent them back but after paying for returning them I had very little money left. Live and learn.
1,shoddy printing and binding,"Encourage by the previous reviewers, I was excited to purchase an entire collection of Anton Chekhov's stories. However, the printing and binding of the books were extremely poor quality. I was afraid that the books would fall apart before I finished reading them. In addition, lines of text were printed on a slope (rather than in the standard straight line!). If Dr. Sekirin is serious about publishing his works-- please get a professional printer, publisher for your books. I was so disgusted, disappointed and immediately returned the books."
5,good for a salsa dance party in your living room,"This product is sturdy and loud. I learned certain ""beats"" from youtube.com when I typed in Cabasa. I have prefected my salsa hip moves and this instrument just makes my routine perfect."
3,"The ""original,"" but not necessarily the best...","I bought it based on the brand recognition, then tried out the Rhythm Tech version - with the rubber-covered handle; I found the workmanship on the RT to equal or surpass the LP, liked the darker wood of the RT, and loved the covered handle...better grip, better feel, more comfortable. I returned the LP and ordered the Rhythm Tech for even less money."
2,Never Again Dirt Devil,"I've had my vacuum for a few years now only b/c I'm too lazy to buy another one. However, I am at the end of my rope. From Day 1 of having this vacuum the belt broke frequently -- and most of the time I was vacuuming on hardwood. If I accidentally ran over a cat toy or piece of string or anything bigger than a crumb, the belt broke. I took to buying lots of extra belts whenever I went to the store. The other day - surprise - the belt broke for no apparent reason. I promptly replaced it and it broke again the minute I turned the vacuum on. I say: NO MORE. I am now determined to buy the best vacuum EVER. I don't care how much it costs!! The only nice thing about this vacuum is the ability to use to the hose/attachments without having to flip a switch; and it is pretty powerful. But that's it. Changing the cannister can be messy and like a few other reviewers, I frequently run over the cord. Something just wasn't designed right there... You've been warned!"
1,What was I thinking?!,"I bought this vaccum a few years ago and can lie to say the first year was great. The second year I had to replace the belt twice, filter 3 times and consistanly had a problem with it getting clogged. I have a fairly clean house, no kids, no pets just me and my spouse. No excuses. This vaccum sucks, and not in a good way!!!! I should have invested in something more reliable, uieter, and a much better sucking power......"
5,Priceless,"This is a must-have book on the most important topic in the world, MONEY.All of Dowd's books are of key importance."
3,Fun & Cute,"This is a cute book to give as a bridal shower gift. I read it a few years after I was married...I thought it was fun & cute and I even picked up a few tips. It talks about many different things, like in-laws, entertaining, friends, neighbors, spats, money, vacations. The author has some great insights and delivers them in a way that keeps your interest."
1,"A Sassy Cosmo ""Helen Gurly Brown"" tone & zero content","I tried to read this after I read ""52 Fights"" and was very dissapointed. TMMG reads like a silly teenage magazine or Cosmo -- Maybe the ""Samanta Jones"" take but with juvenile lingo. It's really self-centered and offers no concrete advice or insight. It also has stupid lines in it like keeping your option open to pose for Playboy. Huh? A waste of time and money. If this is your thing, you can find it free on any number of websites and blogs. ""52 Fights"" was much better."
2,Not as good as it used to be.,I sold this ball for years and it was great. However in the recent batches customers have been complaining it doesn't bounce high enough.
4,good basketball,"I bought this basketball for my 12 year old nephew who plays in a club team but also practices a lot in outdoor courts. He really enjoys the basketball. He uses it mostly outside at the park court. He perfers to use a different one when playing inside court, but he says it's okay indoor as well. He's had it for a few months now leaving it outdoors sometimes in the Arizona heat but it's held up so far. It was a very good price and would buy again if we need to replace it."
5,best ball i ever had,"This ball is great,It has a phenonamal grip and the grip never wears down , the best ball i ever had it has lasted 2 years and i only pumped it up once since i got it i truly recemend this ball to you-Trip Bennett"
1,"On first usage, failed","This has got to be the worst basketball I have ever owned. On the very first usage, while trying to pump the ball up, the airhole plug collapsed into the ball, leaving a large gaping hole there. Naturally, the ball became instantly flat, unable to be pumped up again, and completely useless. Save your money and buy a better ball.Regardless of this horrific failure, the ball itself was of poor quality, feel and did not feel completely symmetrical (not perfectly round). Please do not buy this ball"
4,He loved it.,Need to get your kids outside to enjoy the fresh air? Some bonding time perhaps? Then I suggest you purchase this. The only down side was it didn't come pre-inflated.
4,Grandkid's Christmas present,The quality is very good for the price. I have bought many Spalding sports items and have always been pleased.
1,Not as good as I thought,I think this is not real spalding basketball.I compared it with the real one. I can very easily notice the difference.
3,Too much grips,"I don't really like this ball and here's whyI usually play basketball on the street so that's why i got this. I got the ball pre-pumped which is nice. Then I took it to a nearby school to test it. It has a weird bounce when i start dribbling it from my house to the school but i thought it was what new balls are like. I then try out for some shots, it was decent. But what i really hate about this ball is that it has too much grips. The surface isn't as smooth as my old one. It has little lumps that really tick me off when I dribble. I wouldn't recommend you buying this one unless you like have much grips on a basketball."
3,not nearly as bad as everyone says,"Well, a lot of people really hate this record, and though it may sound harsh, I blame Kenney Jones. His drumming just flat-out sucks, and is bad enough to be a distraction to fans spoiled by Keith Moon's genius. Look past it and there are some cool songs here, and the excellent ""Eminence Front"" makes it all worthwhile.Ivan Rorick"
2,Not One Of Their Better Efforts,"To me, the two albums following 1978's ""Who Are You"" are the least memorable in The Who's catalog.""Face Dances"" had a couple good songs (""You Better You Bet"" and ""Another Tricky Day"" come to mind), but the rest are hardly worth noting.I feel that the same is true for this album. ""It's Hard"" and ""Dangerous"" both rock, but the rest are almost completely forgettable. ""Eminence Front,"" with its totally uninspired lyrics and its tendency to drag, is potentially the worst Who song in existence. It sounds like a radical departure from their traditional sound, and it just doesn't work.I am glad that ""It's Hard"" was not the last studio Who album. ""Endless Wire"" takes a landslide victory over this one."
3,Supergroup swan song takes swan dive,"The Who's final studio album(until they feel the need to release any new material)finds the boys giving a lack-luster effort despite the attempts by Kenny Jones to fill in for the still missing Keith Moon.The album has a few good tracks, notably the FM radio hits 'Eminence front' and 'Athena', the latter featuring one of roger Daltrey's finest vocal performances. The rest of the album is mostly filler that was put in while the band itself was dissolving.The chorus of 'Cry If You Want'tends to get stuck in your head after a listen, so keep your afternoons free. The live bonus tracks are pretty cool, if you're a die-hard fan as they all come off this album.Still, it's great to hear them as they were during that last tour. Final verdict: Only for those with The Who brand underwear."
4,A Suprisingly Good Album!,"The Who's final album, It's Hard, is a very good album. I don't see why would criticize this album. There are a fair amount of good songs on the album. ""Athena"" starts off the album. This song is a catchy little song, with the backing vocals of ""just a girl."" ""It's Your Turn"" is a good John Entwistle written song. ""Cooks County"" is based on a hospital in Chicago called Cook County Hospital. The title track is very good. ""Dangerous"" is probably the best John Entwistle song off the album, with its good bassline and great keyboards. ""Eminence Front"" is my favorite track off the album. With the best synthesizer introduction since ""Baba O'Riley"" and ""Won't Get Fooled Again"", it is a Who classic. ""I've Known No War"" is a great protest song about war. The live tracks are excellent. This ends my review of The Who's last studio album!"
3,The Who But Different,Not as driving as some other albums different feel. 3 of songs are what I would normally expect from the Who. Still a good addition to my Who collection. Great audio!
4,One of the Last Great Rock Albums,"Rock died sometime shortly after this album was released. Perhaps around 1984. Despite the absence of Moon, this disc is sonically beautiful and lyrically complex. Townshend's songcraft is in it's finest form since ""Quadrophenia"" and Entwistle's most mature works can be found here (""It's Your Turn"" and ""Dangerous""). The bonus tracks from the no-longer-available ""Who's Last"" concert album round out this remastered and remixed version quite nicely."
4,Needs to be on DVD! Fair is fair!,"I loved this film growing up. I never actually saw the beginning -- I generally came across it on TBS or TNT during lazy weekend afternoons. Great music. Enjoyable plot. Interesting allusions to Joan of Arc (they watch Saint Joan, the female lead's effigy is burnt in the fire, etc.). This *needs* to come out on DVD."
3,Awesome 80's!,"Bit dated now, but this blew people away in it's day, so really great to have a look at this cult movie now - worth checking out!"
1,Counterfeit DVD - DO NOT BUY!,"This movie has NEVER been released on DVD as of today and the ones being sold here are counterfeit/bootlegged ones.Google this for yourself, this movie has NEVER been issued on DVD.Save yourself the money!"
5,BRING BACK THE MEMORIES,"We need this on DVD. I was a teenager when this movie was being filmed in my home-town of Corpus Christi, TX. I still live in Corpus Christi and alot of things have changed or are gone since the early 80's, but this film caught many of the places and things that I grew up seeing and doing. It would be nice to go down ""memory lane"" and show my kids how things use to be in Corpus. The movie itself is a classic 80's flick and the soundtrack is great as well. I'm not going to buy an overpriced used VHS Tape so I guess I'll just have to wait with the other thousands of people for the DVD."
3,Fair is fair -- Needs a DVD release,"Helen Slater, Pat Benatar's anthem, Christian (""no relation"") Slater in drag, one of Keith Gordon's rare acting gigs, Helen Slater. C'mon, release a DVD. Fair is fair."
1,The Legend Of Billie Jean,"The movie isn't horrible but it certainly doesn't do it for me,maybe because there is some sort of feminist fascist impulse in it and you got this pretty girl who becomes a man(looks like one) by cutting her hair and fighting back(sounds like Liberal Angst more than Teenage Angst) and the audacity of comparison to Joan Of Arc(She Wishes) just some punk kid, I do like the story where she is fighting this chump kid and his sorry excuse for a dad, But I don't care for this empowerment facade hiding behind the story."
1,The Legend Of Billie Jean,"A Reactionary Review: The movie isn't horrible but it certainly doesn't do it for me,maybe because there is some sort of feminist fascist impulse in it and you got this pretty girl who becomes a man(looks like one) by cutting her hair and fighting back(sounds like Liberal Angst more than Teenage Angst,(Helen Slater's Mom was some Hippie AntiNuclear Nut) and the audacity of comparison to Joan Of Arc(She Wishes) just some punk kid, I do like the story where she is fighting this chump kid and his sorry excuse for a dad, But I don't care for this empowerment facade hiding behind the story."
4,Whats that song????,Anybody know the song played during the dance scene? Where Leo dances with Diaz?If so pls mail me at vstephenmail@yahoo.co.in
1,Background music for TV promo,"The Gangs ""theme"" used on the TV promo sounds like the theme to Gettysburg. ???"
4,Captures the Sounds of the Movie,"I bought the album for 1 song. 'New York Girls"" by Finbar Furey. I was pleased that in addition to U2's song, ""The Hands that Built America"", the other music thouroughly captured the movie in mood and feel."
4,My Dear....?,can anyone tell me the name of the song thats playing when Leo DiCaprio meets Bill (Daniel Day-Lewis) for the first time? Its like some Irish drinking song....My dear Annie?
3,Paris by Night,"The book was very good but the condition was not. Brassai: Paris by Night was shipped in the same box along with Ansel Adams: 400 Photographs .The Ansel Adams book was completely encased in plastic wrap but the book Paris by Night was not. They were shipped together in a cardboard box and left on my front stoop in the snow. The box became saturated from sitting in the snow. Because the Ansel Adams book was completely encased in plastic, it was okay. However, the book Paris by Night was damaged from the moisture since it wasn't encased in plastic. The bottom of all the pages were saturated. I tried drying it out but the pages still showed evidence of damage. Since it was a Christmas present for my son, I had no time to return it. He noticed the damage right away..........I was totally embarrassed and angry at the lack of regard for the books and the delivery method. Both books and the box should have encased in plastic."
4,Useful and practical,"needed this for a class. It is easy to read and provides many hands-on, real life situations and examples that you will find useful."
4,Useful for master level counseling students,"I found this book very helpful. I got it for my graduate course in counseling and I was at first a little hesitant. I was looking forward to learning counseling, not helping skills. But Clara Hill makes good points concerning the skills needed to be learned in order to be effective ""helpers"" and counselors. Perhaps this would also be useful for professionals looking to brush off their repetoire, as this includes various stages that clients may be at, from simply exploring to gaining insight to how to approach possible changes and action in the client's life."
5,Excellent real world explanations and applications.,"Claire Hill is an excellent therapist and writer, she makes this book easy to read and applicable in every sense."
4,"Gabriel, Gabriel, Gabriel,","I loved reading this book, it is my first novel by Samantha James, and I must say I was not dissapointed. I am going out and buy more of her books. Cassie and Gabriel's story touched me deeply, because in some ways it reminds me of myself, I loved her fire, she stood up to Gabriel and his awful tight fisted arrogant father, and I loved her for it. WAY TO GO CASSIE!!!!! The characters were strong and sure not weepy and sleepy. Gabriel gave and Cassie definitely did not take. Way to go Samantha James, more characters like Cassie & Gabriel!!!"
3,"A pleasant read, but it could have been an excellent read...","I enjoyed this book to a point...It took me into a culture that I knew little about and the characters were for the most part likable. However I had difficulties in staying the course with Grace who seemed to want to escape the ""suffocating love"" of her family (Is this really love of religious dictatorship?) , but could not make the break needed to bloom into the real person that is there, just below the surface. Her co-dependency was a bit disappointing. Ms Rawles' definitely shows potential as a writer and only needs to get away from the Broussards for her next story."
2,Incomprehensible and Rambling,"I don't want to detract from what others got from reading this book. Judging from the other reviews, it was obviously well-received by many. However, I found this book to be almost incomprehensible and pointless. The author rambles around from meaningless subject to meaningless subject, all propped up by a cute but clever theme of blind men and an elephant. I finished the book and went off scratching my head as to what I'd learned. Perhaps I'm too left-brained. I loaned it to someone else and they brought the book back half-read and said they thought the author needed counseling."
3,India not India.Arie,"I've read some reviews and I have to say that the singer that sings ""Welcome to my empire"" (Spanish & English Versions) is INDIA (a latin star as know as The Princess of Salsa) not India.Arie. Jon Secada's song is amazing!"
1,junk,this is the worst green gas. hard to fill the clip up. does not hold that much gas in the clip.
3,Big colorful art on high quality stock.,"I was taken aback that the first story is Joseph and the coat of many colors. While worded gently in this version, it remains the story of brotherly jealousy leading to selling Joseph into slavery. We surely need to teach children stranger awareness, but the Bible abounds with loving, caring stories. I am sorry the book begins with thisRuth and Naomi make an appearance for example, as does Jesus feeding the 5 thousand. In this version of David and Goliath, it is a stone that is thrown, that takes Goliath down. Somehow that makes a difference to me. David was a skillful sling-shooter and used his training and skill to ""do the impossible!"" That's a great story. Kids going around beaning large people on the head with rocks is not the way I want to teach it......"
5,Worth the money!,"Initially I tried using a Snugli, but it was awkward and difficult to get the baby in and out of without help. The snaps and buckles were not very user friendly. So, when I got the Bjorn as a late baby gift I gave it a try. I will say that I wasn't convinced about keeping it at first b/c it's so expensive. But, I feel I've definitely made good use of it. I've been using it since my baby was 2 mo. old. and I swear I use it more than I use the stroller. Where my baby may fuss in the stroller, he never fusses when he's in the carrier. Now that he's 8 mo. he actually gets excited when he sees me put it on. It's so easy to use I can put it on and get him settled in it with no help at all. The important thing to remember when wearing it is to cinch it tight and stand up as straight as you can while you're wearing it. Otherwise, it will aggravate your back after a short time."
4,Love it but difficult to adjust,"I Love this product - but it is very difficult to adjust. My husband is much bigger than me and if he has recently used it and adjusted it for himself and if I am feeling lazy, I will just pop the baby in the stroller instead of bothering readjusting the Bjorn to fit me. When I do have it fitting properly for me (which usually requires the help of my husband) I LOVE wearing it!"
5,ice-breaker,"Well, my case is certainly the proverbial ice-breaker.I actually use it for my cell phone and everyone asks 'what IS that'.I love it because I can find it even blind as the texture is so different and because it is hard to loose, visually.It took a while to get as Debbie makes them all by hand,one at a time.I do plan to buy another one for another phone."
3,Surprisingly Mediocre,"I love some of his stuff and hate some. Overall I am deeply moved by many of his spiritual and heartsy tracks. What a great poet! But some other stuff just surprises me at times. Overall a great talent, but I honestly expected more from his ""Greatest Hits""."
3,"I like it, but...","There's no doubt that the acting is tremendous in this movie, from both Dame Judy and James Broadbent. The movie is a special achievement in this regard, and Judy Dench deserved an Oscar for her performance. However, the movie is a very incomplete picture of the life of Iris Murdoch, which in fact would be difficult to capture in a 2 hour film. It is a very small, very limited view of the woman who has contributed so much to literature, philosophy and the arts. It is unfortunate that many will only know Iris Murdoch through this movie, and may never experience the insight, wisdom and wit of this truly remarkable artist."
4,A fine piece of cinema,"The real life author Iris Murdoch - who wrote among other novels The Sea, The Sea -- is played by Judi Dench and this film depicts her slow decline from Alzheimer's. It closely examines the jolting effect it has on a strong and loving marriage. The scenes between Broadbent and Dench are powerful a piece of cinema as you could ever see.Of particualr note, Jim Broadbent won many plaudits and he deserved everyone of them for his portrayal of the sensitve caring Bayley as he despairs of taking care of his wife.The film also looks back to their romantic beginnings and the triumphs of their life. It is very hard to see how they could have impoved the linkages between the scenes when they growing up and when Murdoch had gained widespread acclaim. In particular, Kate Winslet plays a very strong younger Iris.I would have liked a little more on the books and a little less interest in Murdoch's sex life, but that seems to be focus of everything these days."
4,GR8 PRODUCT UNTIL...,"This pre-owned camera was given to me - in a barter exchange - in 2008. I used it for my eBay photos. It worked wonderfully - until the Plastic Prongs - that hold the Battery Latch-Door closed - broke off. now I have to admit that I am heavy-handed.I know that when I purchase a new Digital Camera, I will be checking the ""strength"" of the Battery Compartment Door.Other than that, if you understand the features [read the manual], the camera takes great photos - and it has some very nice features that I never really used....All I wanna do is Point and Shoot."
1,Don't bother.,"A pathetic product masquerading and a heavy duty one. The male threaded end of the handle is plastic and can't be tightened. If one tries, it just escapes the female threads in the brush and is, presto!, loose again.The junction between the brush and the handle appears reenforced and sturdy in the pics, but it is neither. I now have yet another push broom that I must baby to insure it's survival. Wobbly piece of junk. Look else where.I once owned a commercial push broom made for roofing. I still think back fondly on it."
1,I thought it would be alot better than it was.,"Fire in the Heart is the only good song all the others were really bad. I definetly do not recomend this cd,"
3,From one extreme to another,Suze wrote this follow up piece because some folks found her old advice to be impossible. Having several months of emergency money put aside etc. The notion that someone hungry for job advancement should work 12 hour days and put groceries on their credit cards may also be impossible. It could also backfire when the company you are giving all your time to fails to notice your efforts. I was actually scolded for staying around too long at work even when I wasn't trying to collect overtime. I did learn something about credit scores though.
3,Not impressed but still read it,"I'd suggest trying it out for yourself. Some parts of the story held my attention, but I thought there was way too much detail and repetitiveness that went into the descriptions of battle scenes. I hope the second book in the series is better."
5,This Book is Epic,"This is among the best books I have read. I originally heard Wrangham on an NPR show discussing some facets of this book & quickly sought it out. It provides an excellent evolutionary background and discussions of humans' closest relatives- especially our closest, the chimpanzee and bonobo, whose life patterns are distinctly different from one another and provide some insight into human behavior and possibilities. The book is very well-written and highly readable regardless of a reader's background on the topic.I had to write after reading some of the negative reviews and misinformation on the book- especially the first editorial review. The book is hardly as dark and disillusioning as it leads one to believe- quite the contrary. I finished the book a few months ago and am still pondering it. Highly recommended!"
4,African salsa,"Altho he was based in L.A. and distributed all his recordings around town, he is from Africa.His style sounds just like salsa.Understated and consistent."
5,Response to no drivers available.,"I have recently purchased this particular work center and to respond to an earlier review posted here I would like to note that drivers for Windows 2000 and Windows XP are available at the Xerox website. The earlier review advised against purchasing this wonderful workcenter if you intended to upgrade above windows 98 or windows nt 4.0. I say, buy it! It is an awesome machine!"
4,runs on window ME,"I upgraded to Windows Me and lost the scanning & faxing (printing was not affected.) Called Xerox support, very helpful person guided me through getting new drivers for the printing and twain functions. But I had to change from USB to paralell cable to get the most out of ME. It was simple to do the driver fixes and it now performs great"
1,Don't Go There,"I've had this THING for about 6 months. I have yet to get it to scan anything without crashing. Sometimes it prints, sometimes it doesn't. Mostly it crashes. When it does print, the quality is lousy. The printer drivers stink. I've got Windows 2000 and I keep getting errors. Because of these drivers and their quirks, I have lost all my printer set ups (and I generally have 4 or 5 printers set up at time) at least 3 times which has required my office's IT staff to rebuild them. I am not some casual computer user either. While I am not the biggest geek on the block, I'm a pretty sophisticated computer user who can get himself out of most trouble. This thing has completely defied all my efforts. Don't bother even considering it. Its not worth the trouble."
5,Awesome historical fiction,Great book for young and old readers. Good historical accuracy and action packed. Read it 15 years ago and have recommeneded it to others and now my 19 year old son is totally engrossed in it
4,A Close-up Look at American History,"Thom fleshes out American history with real characters, and an inside look at one of early America's most influential families. Although some of the Revolutionary War and Indian War sequences drag on a bit long, it was well worth the trip as a launching pad for the famed Lewis & Clark exploration. In fact, I hated to leave them as they reached the Pacific, and would like to see how they faced those same challenges on the journey home. It paints a less than flattering picture of our nation's early history, while at the same time celebrating the bravery of those who made it happen. Readers who enjoy historical fiction will enjoy even more this piece of history that Thom embraces like a story."
2,"Very, very tricky...","My initial excitement for this game was soon squashed by the frustration brought about by the realization that the later missions are essentially very complex puzzles that require a linear approach and split-second timing. I like the concept of team members with a different array of skills and equipment, with the spy and the sniper being personal favorites. (Although the need to limit the sniper's ammunition is understandable from a play-balancing perspective it seems very unrealistic to suggest that a soldier could only carry five bullets.) The team roles however add to the frustration, since the death of any member will cause you to fail a mission. Your team members seem to die distressingly early and often, so one may feel obligated to save accordingly. This merely compounds the difficulty and frustration of the later missions. I soon realized that this game just wasn't fun anymore."
2,"Gorgeous packaging, useless content.","What we have here is just make-up and cosmetics, and almost no value in terms of quality.The first show has the best editing and sound (and a great drummer), but there is one little problem: you can check Janick Gers in all his mediocrity, a kind of worsened Ritchie Blackmore rip-off, a guitar player with no feeling, no finesse. The solos are, ALL OF THEM, ludicrous, noisy, useless. It's a miracle this guy got the gig in Iron Maiden.The Skunkworks show is so badly edited, with MTV-style cuts from second to second, that you cannot watch it properly.The show in Brazil is a bootleg, for Heaven's sake!! Bad sound, bad edition, bad image quality, a total waste of time.The best part are the video-clips, believe it or not...All the reviews below are typical of Maiden fans, who will endorse any piece of crap this band (or his members) release."
4,went to bed reading this every night,"I really went to bed reading this book every night till the end I shared this with others in my building. I was fascinated and gained insight into the great risks taken by many people for the pleasures of so many of us experimenting or reguarly consuming drugs. It really should be legalized like pharmaceuticals and bring the bad part of the black marketing, out in the open. It could generate taxable income and hold irreputable dealers accountable, financially and socially."
1,Vacuum,Store listing was incorrect and the wrong product was sent. Had to send back and pay for return which was more than product. Very frustrating...
5,Lucky Dirt Devil,"This was a Christmas gift for my wife (aren't I romantic?), and she loved it. It's very powerful - much moreso than our old Dust Buster - and not too heavy. She wanted one that picked everything up in a small area without having to haul out the big cannister vac. She's pleased with me and her Dirt Devil."
1,Dirt Devil filters,"The Dirt Devil Extreme Power is great but the filters need to be improved. In my house, after one use, the filter is a real mess and MUST be cleaned throughly. My advice is to brush it as clean as possible(HA!) out in your yard. [I use an old toothbrush or vegetable brush.] If you try to clean it over a gargage can there will be dust everywhere. I can see that these filters will not last long. Also, they can't be washed. So I love the duster but hate the filters."
4,I enjoyed this very much,"This book was a great deal more fun than the first of Ms. Fuller's novels. Excellent character development, a much better plot and a few ice axes thrown in for fun. A good solid read for the beach."
3,Too much,"I enjoyed this book to a certain point. I loved that it was concerning a larger female heroine, that she wasn't scared of her own shadow and that she had a bunch of good friends. There were points that irritated me, the fact the author kept pushing more and more the large size of the heroine-a few mentions are enough, not the minimum of one per chapter- The stereotypical of old lady/fat lady getting used by a man because they are ""unwanted"" and the constant reminder that her husband left her for a skinnier woman. I will probably read more of these books because I enjoyed enough of the main story lines."
1,terrible waste of talent,"Soldier returns to the UK and with the help of a small group - decide to take justice into their own hands. A great cast including Sean Bean and Bob Hoskins are unable to do justice to a terrible script.Although this does show a little of the underbelly of the UK it is bleak and unpleasant and Bean's character has no redeeming features at all which makes it hard to sympathise with his views.SPOILERS...As an example of how this fails to work - within a couple of days one character (a barrister) goes from balking at executing a murderer to getting involved in a machine gun shoot out with the police! There are few characters you associate with and this tagged onto a tedious script makes for some very poor viewing.Best avoided, even if you (like me) enjoy action films"
3,Not a bad album but album #2 is better....,"I was re watching the show again recently and reminded myself about the fact I liked the songs. I ordered it and once I played the album. I have to admit there are really only about 3 songs I like. One of which is her singing Garbage's ""Stupid Girl"". I would say try to find it used if you can. Not sure if it is really worth full price."
5,BIG STAR,I bought the instant star cd and its awesome! It is only availale as an import but I hope it gets released in California soon. It is my faverite cd everJan
5,OMFG,"I love Alexz Johnson's voice. I just bought the CD off of here and even though it hasn't arrived, I've heard her voice on the-N.com.My fave song is definitely Skin which is really the whole reason I started watching Instant Star and the whole reason I bought this CD.My advice... buy it."
3,Advertisment masqurading as an article,Have to agree with the magazine being full of fluff. Only once did they cover the double wing offense in an entire year. The rest of the time it was ads left and write and articles that made you want to buy their material.
4,A decent study guide for the exam,"Provides you needed information to take the exam and pass it. Though some extra study material won't hurt. Has some pretty bad mistakes, like talking about SNMP, the protocol what they keep using on the book is SMTP. Overall good book to study for the test."
1,Can't believe book say's MCP approved study guide on it,"Microsoft must get some pretty generous royalties from Sybex. I guess Microsoft feels if you compliment them in a book, they will endorse it. This book is disorganized, redundant and must finish each paragraph with ""This topic will be covered in greater detail later in this book"". The answers in the back of the book are often wrong and the book contradicts itself. No wonder people often rely on braindumps to get through. It would be nice to just purchase one book that covered everything and would get you through. On top of this book, I now have to pay for another exam and another book. I am very dissapointed in Sybex for producing such an aweful product and Microsoft for allowing them to say that it's a Microsoft Certified Professional Approved Study guide. I will think twice before before buying something because it has that label on it."
2,Large Crew hair gel,"I received what I ordered but it was not what I wanted. I thought I was getting the Crew ""Super Glue"". I am very disappointed with the product I received."
2,good price lousy product,"This gel feels greasy after 8 hours in your hair. I think there are better products out there, it seemed like a good idea at the time"
1,Phony baloney!,"This junk is studio hacks trying to sound like the real thing. Listen to ""Stand by me"" The guy is way off key. An insult to the original artist. Need I say more?"
5,Zakk Wylde,"I saw in one review, acoustic Southern junk. just to say, PanterA, and alot of metal was influenced by rock n roll and southern rock. Acoustic guitars, if you can play them that means u can play. Youve got none of that staticy distortion to cover ur ass when u fu*k up.If you can put together songs like this and play them on an acoustic YOU CAN PLAY! Ive tried many times but coming up with 1 acoustic song is hard enough. For instance- Godsmack's Other Side- they took songs they had already done,with distortion, and proved themselves able by making them acoustic. So all in all this CD is good, and so is Zakk, but your not a fan if u cant appreciate everything they do..."
5,"exellent guitar work, truly shows versatility and roots.","Zakk Wylde has a vey SKYNARD feel to this album and shows his influence of both them and when he was with Ozzy and company. Zakk is probobly one of the the best(if not the best) studio guitarists we have today. If you thought Pride and Glory was good, you would be in for a treat with Book of Shadows."
5,Top 10 Cd List !,"This CD is a Masterful creation, In my opinion. ((THE BEST composition of ZAKK'S CAREER !!))If.. I had to make a list of 10 Recordings I could take with me to a deserted Island. This would be one.Way Beyond Empty. Is one of my favorite tunes.. IF.. you are looking for Heavy Metal Fist in your face rock.. Move on.. This isnt for you.. This has a VERY classic Southern rock feel to it.. But.. Don't get me wrong.. It still has enough overdrive to twist your nipples. To sum this release up.. I would absolutely say.. This is one of the ALL TIME ... UNDER RATED releases of all time.. It .. and ZAKK.. deserved much more recognition, than it got..This release.. is a great Mix of his Pride and Glory era, and a healthy dose of The Black Label society.. A perfect storm as i would describe it...To me.. This CD is his Apex release."
2,Didn't work for me,One of my ferrets quit using his litter box and started using a corner on a shelf of his cage instead so I bought these. I tried to use just one these springs in the corner at first and it didn't work. My ferret just backed up to it and poo'd on it. I then tried using all four in the same corner and all that made him do was poo in front of the springs. My ferret would also try pulling and chewing on the springs so I gave up and removed them. I bought a toy that fastens to the cage and put it in that corner and finally my ferret quit going there and started using his litter box.
5,I love this book. So does my 2 year old,"A great idea, beautifully produced.The left pages feature art work from modern masters. On the right pages, an element from the art (a circle, a star, etc.) is isolated. My daughter likes to read this book 5 or 6 times a sitting. I've learned a thing or two about modern art. Sweet."
2,Not what I expected,I thought this was a CD of Japanese hits but it's a collection of mostly American songs that were hits in Japan.
2,Fair artwork...but the story...eep!,This graphic novel left much to be desired in that it drifts from the original story line...buy used from comic stores.
5,The best Acid Jazz CD ever!,"I really liked Brand New Heavies anyway, however, after I got this CD, this has by far, become my most favorite CD of all time. Not to mention, that I am now a BNHeavies addict!!!"
2,Ummm...,"Go for any other RF adapter, except for this one. It distorts the picture and turns the screen dark grey (yes, I was on the right channel!) Consider another one instead."
3,Just enough is right!,"Since just about everybody in Scandinavia speaks English, even 4th grade children, this book's only utility is for reading signs, especially if you are driving, and for reading menus, especially if you are eating or want to eat. For those of you who are interested in languages, this may be helpful...or not. Worth the price if you use it.Have a great trip!"
5,for compost tea,i purchased this along with the seaweed for compost tea. people say this does not have a smell but let me tell you this stuff is sooooo stinky. when i use this in my compost tea i have to wear a mask it just makes you gag it smells so fishy. maybe it dosent stink that bad to other people but to me i can deff smell it. it does make the plants happy no bad there. but when transplanting the plants i have in pots i have to not use this in the tea for about 4 or 5 months or the soil will smell so rotten and im afraid the wild animals will try to get into it. but it does work well.
3,Adequate to the job,"This in a decent hand vac, but not a great one. Gets the job done pretty much. What I don't like is that it's not pleasant to use: screams like a banshee; is heavy in the hand; the business end is blunt and clumsy and hard to get into places where it needs to go; and the little clear plastic extension is too tiny to be very useful. Wouldn't buy another one."
2,Lilliputian NYC pad + minikin stotage + negligible budget = Bitsy Vac,"It was living in a teensy apartment that made me buy this thing in the first place. It looked great, had good reviews and a reasonable price so I went ahead and clicked 'BUY NOW'.It worked great, not too noisy, sucked up everything in sight. It wasn't something we used on a regular basis (translate: we didn't vacuum/ clean the house much) but after the 6th month though, it just stopped working.Performance was great while it lasted. Judging by it's value for money, this vac cost me +/- $3.00 per use, so I would say it was a bit unreasonable. As for endurance, well it did up in the dumpster after the 6th month.Great start. Bad ending. Wouldn't recommend it."
3,Just to point out the other reviews...,"Just to be clear, I do not own this vacuum - However, I am looking around and noticed that this same vacuum is sold by amazon (not by this outside seller) on another page for $20, and the reviews their are totally positive. Check out that page before you commit to purchase. (In case you're wondering, since I have to give a star rating, I just gave it what the average rating was already.)"
5,Beginners guide to ebay,Was very pleased with this book and how easy it is to follow. Was please how quickly the book arrived.
4,Thin,this jacket was a gift but apparently it keeps my uncle really warm in freezing temperatures. Made of cotton and some other mesh material in the inside
5,"Excellent quality and wear, repeat buyer!","Wonderfully made, warm, bought as a gift for my nephew, who will only wear Carhartt and being over 6'2"" the tall fits him perfectly!"
4,hoping for warmer,"nice roomy, love the inside pocket, would have liked the thermal lining to be a bit thicker, hence warmer which was the reason for only 4 stars"
4,Fussy Dad loved it!,"My dad never wants us to get him anything for his birthday. This year he asked for a hooded lined sweatshirt. We never buy him clothes because he's so fussy. I saw this and took a shot. He loved it! The only thing I noticed is that it would be nice if it was a bit longer. But Dad doesn't seem to care;) Also, I have to say that customer service @ Moda was wonderful to deal with! Thank you for getting it to me on time..."
2,Itchy,"I was really looking forward to receiving this sweatshirt, and when it did I was pretty disappointed. I ordered a 2x Tall and it fit me perfect, but it was the itchiest article of clothing I have ever bought. I was bummed too cause it was really nice, heavy and dutiable, but ultimately I returned it and got a refund."
3,WiNnEr TaKEs AlL,"Mary Kate wants to go out for the white Oak softball team but she was doing so badly infront of the coach because she wanted to make a good impression. So Cambell, MK's roomate, lets Mk train with her every morning.Since Marykate hasn't been training lately she was so out of shape. Can things get worse for Mary Kate?Meanwhile Ashley became gossip reporter and has been writing things about people, but she wrote something so private about MK. What is it? Read this book to find out!"
5,Inspiring for Recovery,"Though I read this book two years ago I will never forget it. Cynthia brings the reader through all her hardships. At times it seems like she will never get better and that the eating disorder will take her life. However, no matter how sick she is, there is always a hint of hope. Slowly, after years of being sick with anorexia and bulimia, you see her begin the slow, painful process of recovery. Her life, little by little, begins to piece itself somewhat into normalcy. Eventually she is fully recovered and happy about it. This book brings what most other books on eating disorders do not; a happy ending. I recommend it highly."
3,Eating Disorders Are Boring,"I agree with the reviewers who found the language juvenile. However, this is a topic widely read by a younger audience, so perhaps that was her intent. I've certainly read one or two worse books on the subject. I don't recall any horrific proofreading errors, the binding was sturdy and the paper was sturdy.However. This. Narrative. Dragged. On. Forever. I realized 2/3 of the way through that I could predict her next action, her next interaction. I truly wanted something to change, and I knew I had *years* to go yet. It was so very repetitive, so very predictable, so very. . .boring.I donated this book to a local library in 2001 and haven't seen it since. Anorexia and bulimia continue to be repetitive, predictable, and boring. If this was the author's attempt stylize the eating disorder experience in text, she succeeded. This is the biggest danger of the disease: not that you'll die from it, but that you'll live with it."
1,Be careful not to step in the hyperbole!,"I have attempted to read Ayn Rand but could not get past the obvious flaws. Perhaps you could comment. Does it not seem like an incomplete premise to state that the foundation of ethics is the survival and happiness of the individual? Since when have any primates achieved survival and happiness individually, as if the group were of no consequence? Additionally,where does the industrialist/capitalist derive his right to access natural resources and infrastructure as well as civic services if not from an implicit or explicit negotiation with society.This book seems like an over-reach, or as Christoper Hitchens said,""Arrogation""."
1,I don&#65533;t subscribe to her point of view.,"Ayn Rand delivers a boatload of B.S. If you ever wanted a list of reason's to justify selfish acts. Then this book is for you. Put yourself above your family your friends and your god (unless your god is Ayn Rand). Rand gives you plenty of reason's why you should do what's good for you, regardless of the outcome."
5,The root of ALL good.,"I have read this book; and l have come to the conclusion that if everybody understood what this book preaches, this world would be a better place. Any person searching for answers in his own personal life, will find them here. A book like this is needed by EVERYBODY in this world. People who criticize this book's ideas are afraid of the truth because it hits close to home."
2,Characteristic of Rand,As in all Rand's works there seems to be a gap between what is said and what can actually be put into practice. Good attempt but she assumes that all rational people must come to the same conclusions as her. The Cult of Rand as it is said. You may not judge by your whims but you can judge as long as they are Rand's whims.
2,From a Barry Manilow fan...,"Warning: some of the songs listed on the box are abbreviated versions and should be listed as such. They fade out half way thru the song. I was very disapointed.Would be much better in chronological order. It is in some places, but then jumps around for no apparent reason.It seems like Barry attempted to show what a talented entertainer he is, and he is very talented. It is just this box set tries to do too many things, and accomplishes nothing. It just tries too hard."
5,Truly the ultimate guide,"I would highly recommend this book - or any book by this author - to anyone who wants to crack the code and land a position in federal law enforcement. As with his ""Guide to Careers in Federal Law Enforcement,"" the author presents pertinent information in a complete, in-depth, and organized manner. You can't go wrong here."
1,50 / 50 chance it works,"I have one of these and it seems to work fine. I had to replace the other end of my system, so I bought another. Reviews had indicated probems at both the low and high ends of amplification. Mine worked OK so why not. After one week the low end went out. No channels from 5 to 2. It will go back."
5,I can smell a Jew here.,"jews you gotta love em... especially their jewish instincts. wonderful article... we always need to see both sides of the story, however biased they seem to be! if you think CNN and other jewish owned media outlets are not biased think again... the fact that 99% of the media in the US is owned by jews obliges one to question the tacit propaganda beneath the mass media's ""neutral"" face."
3,Good Earrings,"I bought this for my then 5 month old daughter when she lost her existing earrings. The earrings are of good quality. It was easy to put the earrings in her ear. It is also the correct size for her small face. It does not overextend at the back, so it does not poke her even when she lies down. The only downside is that the thread is tiny, so she may not be able to wear any other earring if the hole in her ear closes to the tiny dimensions of this thread. I would have bought the bigger size if the product information and photographs were clearer. Hence the 3 stars."
3,Just ok game,"This was just an ok game. It was not one that I think would become a favorite but more like a ""once in a while"" game. It was not really easy to play and it seemed like it dead ended. Hard to tell who was winning etc."
3,Can anyone say BRIGHT,"I don't know if it is my computer that is terrible with showing true color, or if it is the picture, but this is a brilliant orange. It really is a mini bad, as you can probably put only the bare baby essential, that is, diapers, wipes and a change of clothing, for a short outing in this bag."
4,A cool Game!,Very cool if you want to find your new style! You can try different shades on and do your hair to find a great color! A little pricey but tottally worth it!
4,More gems from Kelly,"Australian singer-songwriter Paul Kelly sets high standards for himself but lives right up to them on Comedy.He has written 15 of the 18 songs on this double album and most of them are gems. ""Don't Start Me Talking"" is as good as any other of Kelly's hits. ""Stories Of Me"", ""Wintercoat"", Brighter"", I Won't Be Your Dog Anymore"", ""I Can't Believe We Were Married"" and the inspiring ""From Little Things Big Things Grow"" are just some of the tracks that show off Kelly's lyric talent.Even Messenger Steve Connolly's ""Leaving Her For The Last Time"" stands up well in very good company.Like all good storytellers, Kelly keeps his tales relatively clear and simple.There is more than an hour of music on Comedy, but it goes very quickly."
5,Each story a treasure: A prize of a book!,"The Tropics is a great quick read. This novel is Ideal for a long plane trip. Each story stands out on its own. However each is enriched by Mary Deal's artful skill of linking them together either by location or by a continued plot.In particular Mary Deal's writing ability shines through when she sets a suspenseful stage. For example while reading ""Caught in a Rip"" I identified with Lilly to the extent of feeling myself literally clutching at powerful ocean waves in an attempt to be saved.As an added bonus, and a refreshing surprise, each story conveys at least one important lesson of life. Therefore in addition to sheer entertainment it offers opportunities for reflection of both self and our environment."
1,Don't expect Saylor or Davis here,"I could not even get through the first two chapters of this book, and I will read almost ANYTHING. It is very slow and does not drive the imagination like other works set ancient Rome. I for one will wait for Marcus' and Gordianus' next adventure!"
2,No drivers for Linux,"Its a middle of the road printer.. and I've been using without complaint for ~2 years. Does seem to chew thru the ink, but I guess that's the business model now.. cheap printers, expensive ink.Recently tried to move it to a linux server in the house so we could share it amongst several computers. Alas there are no printer drivers that I can find."
1,Gross Logistics Tail,"Not a bad printer; I like the quality of print... but as said elsewhere, very expensive to maintain... Ink cartridges don't last long and are, as far as I can tell, more expensive."
3,"Not a text printer, for sure!","I bought this printer because it was exceedingly cheap after rebate. Big mistake. It MUST be a photo printer, because it certainly doesn't deliver on text. All text seems to be in shades of sepia, even at the darkest settings.I can't tell you how it works on color photos, so I won't give it the worst rating. Neither will I give it the best, because I am presently trying to resolve a technical issue where it prints one job and then waits for a full 5 minutes before outputting the next one in the queue. So far, tweaking Printer Settings in the XP Control Panel hasn't worked.On a positive note, I think the Canon Easy WebPrint toolbar looks like an easy way to print out full web pages; I'll have to try it when I get the other problem solved."
1,look elsewhere.,"I have had this printer for a few years now and I wish I had bought something else. As a few other people have mentioned this printer is expensive to maintain. The ink costs a fortune. It printed decent photos for the first few months we had it, but now all the photos we print come out looking horribly. And I have been having the same smearing problem that another reviewer commented on. The pictures are of such bad quality that I don't bother to print photos anymore. I only use this printer to print documents now. I hope to replace it with a much better quality photo printer soon."
2,Dock Pump,"I did not receive the item shown. It also does not pump fuel, just injects air into the tank to force the fuel out. This does not work for my application, it would take all day to pump enough air into a large tank in order to force the fuel up and out of the tank. I need a pump that pumps fuel not air. This would work for smaller tanks only.Would the one shown pump fuel only?"
5,Warmth to die for !,"I discovered Mark Colby around the time of the cross-over jazz revolution in the mid-late 70's, circa Bob James etc and have always wanted to hear him leading his own group...well, I was fantastically elated at this CD; it is an awesome recording, but his tenor warmth, it's timbre and his licks are amazing and refreshing in this world of so much schlock jazz.Support this man, he's doing a great job ; keep the main stream & cross over jazz flags flying !"
1,DOES NOT WORK,"I bought this keyboard from someone who advertised it as working with a BB Bold 9700; when you go to the G-Tech website, it only lists it as working with some much older models. I could not get it to work. I sent an email to their tech support (the phone number is out of service) on Tuesday; I have yet to hear back from ANYONE. The long and short of it? Don't buy...unless.... the person selling it here on AMAZON will gaurantee it to work, i.e. you can return it if it doesn't."
2,eh could be better.,so i'm typing on it now . . .the clicking noise gets old fast and it's about as fast as a cell phone keyboard. took a while to set up but it runs fine now. i haven't been able to get it running on my Droid yet. over all it's worth it for a little less money (used a coupon). I hope it's studier than it looks. Hardcore geeks don't waste your time. Casual users better have a geek on hand for setup.
3,Make sure your player will playback DVD+R,"Hey, systems engineer, the reason you can't burn a DVD-R is because this burner only burns DVD+R/RW. You should know to read the specs on hardware you buy. The reason this product is priced $... below it's dual format brother, is because many DVD players won't play back the DVD+R format."
3,not for todays children,"they lose enthusiasms soon. with psp and ps3, they receive more real action so i just recommend it for nostalgic grown up"
5,The greatest toy I've played with since 1963,"I got my first set of Rock em Sock em Robots in 1963 and believe it or not there still in the attic in the original box...I loved this toy as a kid and I love it now that I'm a 50 year old man. My friends and I will pull them down from the attic some Sundays and play with them during half time. What GREAT fun. Get your child a set today, they last forever. Take it from me..."
1,"This is NOT the original, it is a half sized copy!!!!","This product says original all over the box, but it is a cheap, half sized copy. You'd think it would be illegal to claim something as original when it isn't even close to the same size. I would have gladly paid more to get a full sized version. I guess I'll hit ebay and see if I can find a used vintage full sized version for a reasonable price."
1,Don't waste your money,"Wish I'd had time to read reviews first, but I needed a game for a party quickly, and they didn't have what I was looking for. I was thrilled to see this game back (my brothers played forever in the 60's), but we just set it up before the party, and the heads barely pop up. I put 3-in-1 oil in the necks, which helped only a tiny bit. No one will play with this game tonight......going to write a complaint letter to Mattel tomorrow."
5,Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots review,"I am very pleased with the purchse and I was extremely pleased at the quick delivery I received. I had been looking for this product and was unable to find it in such great, actually new, condition. This product was purchased as a gift for someone who is very special to me. I enjoyed seeing their suprise when they opened it. Thank-you for your help with this purchase."
1,Utter Trash,"I've never played with the original set, so I have no basis for comparison, but the 2 sets I have bought (the first as a gift for someone else) are utter trash. The robots are difficult to manipulate, and even if you have one person hold one robot down and the other punch it repeatedly it still takes an absurdly long amount of time for the head to pop up. No play value at all."
2,Not as good as the original,"My brother and I had this game when we were little back in the late 70's / early 80's. We played it quite a bit and always had a great time. My nephew, who just turned 4, saw the game advertised on TV and wanted it for his birthday very badly. I bought it for him and was excited to watch him play it. After his party we put the game together and were quickly disappointed. Not only is the game half as big as it used to be (it's really small now), but the heads of the robots are so tight that no matter how many jabs they take, they won't pop up. We tried everything to loosen them up but nothing seemed to work. My nephew quickly grew frustrated with it and now won't play it because ""it's not any fun; nothing happens"". My brother and I have tried playing it and still it doesn't work. I guess they just don't make 'em like they used to."
1,"Bad Quality, Booring","Don't bother wasting your money on this. Someone gave my 4yr old son this game for Xmas. The title is classic and nostalgic but the modern version is a cheap showing. Small characters, flimsy controls, difficult to actually ""box"" each other, and most importantly it is not at all fun to play. Not very durable either...characters keep popping off the board.My son played with this game for 10 minutes, declared it was a bad game, and then put it away never to be seen again. They need to increase the quality and game play of this toy so the don't deceive people based on the nostalgic name.- JT Clark / San Jose, cA"
3,Not what it used to be,We got this for our boys (6 and 10). My husband and I loved it years ago. Not the same. You get two hits and the head goes up. And it seems to be the same one each time. We exchanged it and still had this problem. Very frustrating for our kids. One was always winning.
1,Junk,"It's not made nearly as well as the original. Heads pop off too easily, or not at all. Robots are difficult to maneuver. A big disappointment."
2,NOT LIKE THE ONES THEY MADE WHEN I WAS A KID,"This item is essentially a minature, cheaper quality version of the ones they made in the 70s. There's nothing in the description to let you know its so small, unless the product dimensions are shown. It's about 1/3 the size of the original, and seems to be of cheaper quality. They used to have metal parts inside - now everything's plastic. Right out of the box, one of the robots has an arm that will barely move. None of the arms move great. Its still fun for my 3-year old, but its a real shame they changed it from the original!"
4,"Fun toy, don't take it seriously","My four-year-old grandson has had a good time with this; we weren't expecting much, I bought it because we thought the Rockem-sockem robots in Toy Story II were funny, and I knew he'd laugh when he got one. He did, and has enjoyed it.This works OK, seems reasonably well-built, and has withstood some pretty serious pounding. It's not necessarily a perfect toy, but who would buy one of these for that? It's a silly little game, that's good for some lighthearted fun, and a good copy of a classic game from way back."
2,A waste of money,"It's not really a game, just cheaply-constructed plastic robots hitting each other. Ours broke after about 2 uses."
4,Rock em sock em is a classic,This toy is a toy for big guys. Buy it for adult males and watch what happens. It's very fun. Show your best fights on You Tube. I will watch.
1,Don't buy this.,"My son and I played with it for more than an hour and were never able to get the heads to pop up. Pretty pointless. In addition, the rope that goes around the ring is not long enough and won't stay put. I don't know what Mattel was thinking with this. Guessing the original was better."
3,Retro Rock em Sock Em,This was Christmas gift to my nephew. His parents and I all played with this as a child. The new version is not as durable as the original from the sixties. My nephew did enjoy playing with it.
3,The new Rockem Sockem robots...,"I was disappointed to find that the Rockem Sockem robots I remember so well as a kid had magically shrunk down to pint-sized replacements. I would have been completely satisfied if they had retained thier size, which in turn would have made them retain their original greatness. The lesson here boys...if it ain't broke, don't fix it!"
2,Blue boxer had a broken right arm,"Overall - really cheap quality, don't bother unless its to keep the kids happy for the 1 day it works."
4,great toy,this game brings back memories and years of enjoyment and I'm sure my kids will enjoy this just as much if not more than I did as a kid. Thanks for bringing them back!
5,Edge of Seat Reading !,"As always I can't resist reading Roberts the minute I buy the book but with this one I REALLY couldn't put it down ! If you have 2 days to just sit on the edge of your seat and read a truly good mystery/love story, then this is the one to buy ! THe back and forth story line was a great touch ! THere were enough details to give the reader a view of where you were at on the island as each chapter took place. Forget the housework,cooking and call off work and buy this book !The best thing though is that it is complete at the end and you aren't sitting there wishing the author had the time to finish the book's last chapter as has been the case with some authors lately !"
2,wouldn't read it again,"I felt like I was watching a poorly made horror movie that included casual sex while the killer was planning his next move. I can deal with there being a rape or murder because all suspense books are based on some type of violence, but did there have to be such graphic detail? I only finished it because I wanted to know who the psycho was. All violence put aside, it was a decent suspense story but didn't include any romance whatsoever. Casual sex does not equal romance in my book. Reader discretion advised: rape, murder, lots of casual sex, adult scenes and overall violence. Not on my bookshelf anymore."
4,Fresh musical arrangements,An ensemble of unidentified professional singers performs 30 well-known love songs in fresh musical arrangements. I found all three CDs to be easy listening and relaxing.
3,Fury 4 DVD,"Quality of shows was passable , but not great. It does remind me of the show when i was a kid."
5,Fury,"Love this DVD. I very fondly remember the ""Fury"" series. I, like many other children of the 50's so wanted a horse of my own. I finally realized my dream when I was grown and acquired my first (of several since) horse. He was black and of course, his name was ""Fury""."
4,Great fun in the afternoon,"Unfortunately there are only four episodes here , including the pilot. Here in Europe it is possible to buy through Amazon.de all 5 seasons. These dvd's are region 2 and are in German and English. They are great fun and a good picture quality."
4,Good Value,Good quality at a good price. You can use one or use all to play games. Don't over inflate or the ball will not bounce as well. I would purchase again.
1,get a plextor,"Only 4x? One of the slowest I've used even at 4x speed. Pextor's PX-712a or Nec's latest 3500a write much faster and consistent(12x for the plexy, 16 x for nec). They both support more formats(Nec=all known formats, Plextor=all except dual layer write).Plus cdr/cdrw is much much faster at 48x, about 2 min tops for any cdr. I don't know how they justify the price of this drive as you can get more than double the performance for less. Nec's can be had for under $100, do a search."
3,Good at what it does - so far,"I received this item as a gift, so I can't really complain. At the moment I am still running Windows 98SE on an HP Pavilion that meets the minimum system requirements for this drive - at least according to what's printed on the side of the box. On the + side, this drive is *so* fast at burning CD's I'm still getting used to it! On the minus... well, there must be some incompatibility either with Win98SE or with my Pavilion (Athlon III?) because no matter what I try the 'DVD Builder' program simply will not respond. Not much help on the TDK site either. So, if I'd paid money for this and was stuck with my computer I would be angry. But as I said it was a gift and I am buying a brand new Dell (never again HP!!) with a builtin DVD+RW drive so I don't care."
3,"Good workout, but no menu option!","This would have been a 5 star video if it had the menu and chapter options. I was disappointed because this video has no menu, no chapters, no other options. It instantly starts to play when you insert it (there isn't even an fbi warning!). I find this to be extremely frustrating because I often will combine a part of one dvd with another to complete or vary my work out. I so wanted to use the beautiful meditations at the end but the only way to get there would be to sit and hold the fast forward button my player. BUMMER!"
3,Sweet Story,"This is the fourth in the six-book series, and again it's a stand alone book. I've a feeling they are all stand alones...This story was a good, fast read. It's about a woman, who comes off a bit snobby in my opinion and has a really expensive house. She suddenly finds herself invaded by a man and his two sons with a flash flood wipes their little cabin away...oh, and a puppy that causes a lot of ""accidents"" along with the boys' help.There is an unresolved issue in this story. We never DO find out why the teddy bear is so important to the boys, nor is the trouble with the older boy solved. I've a feeling that Brianna is going to have her hands full with him and his attitude. His father may need to give him a whipping to show him who's boss...The rescue of Bud was the best part of the story, I think. And Bre's conversion seemed to come a bit to abruptly. But other than that, it was okay."
2,an exciting yawn--if that's possible?,"This book is all rant all the time--or maybe book as docudrama is a better description. For somebody who supposedly approaches this with the eye of an investigative reporter, Critser seems surprisingly sloppy at connecting the dots. And though he does a nice job of presenting his more credible material, that's the very stuff where you feel like saying ""I've heard it all before"". So it's not like he's breaking any news here.It's a good read if you check your brains at the door."
4,Accomplishes the task,"Such a small inexpensive thing that can dramatically change the look and mood of the area in which it is used. You can slightly rotate the light up or down, but only about 10 degrees or so, and it requires some force. The 15 watts is actually brighter than you might think. In fact I may tone it down a little since my goal was to illuminate a painting, but it brightens a whole section of room along with it."
1,"Prime Pacific Trading Flatware Set wiht Black Handles, 24 Pieces",I thought they were cheap. They are very thin and may not last long. Very disappointed in the quality and would not recommend to anyone.
2,Too simple--not much you can learn,"Instead of teaching you how to shoot a good picture using your digital camera, this book is more about introducation of digital camera and how to manipulate the picture you have taken. If you have one digital camera and play with it, I wont recommend you to buy this book, because you would not learn anything from the book. But if you have no digital camera and not much experience with computer, this book is a good start."
1,Ghastly,"The noise this alarm makes is indescribably hideous. Do NOT leave it armed while you're in the house. Live in an apartment or condo? This is not for you. I placed it on the surface I wished to protect (the stove) and ever so gently turned it on to the low-sensitivity setting. It went off. That was the longest two seconds of my life. My head still hurts. The noise is so shocking that I couldn't even react to reach for the alarm to turn it off. I'd go into cardiac arrest if it went off at night. Returned it immediately. I expect a pet alarm to make a noise which startles the cats, not causes us all to writhe in agony."
4,Camouflage Fans need it,"When did you last hear this band? What song do you remember? The Great Commandment? Love is a Shield? Well, Camouflage is back with their Best of, and you probably need to own it. Some of their newer stuff you may not have heard such as the superb but moody 'Crime'. Also, the remix by William Orbit of 'Love is a Shield' is worth the price of the cd alone. This cd would have been worth 5 stars however, if it had included an amazing song from their first album 'That Smiling Face' and some more remixes would have been nice as well."
1,A Daytime Soap Opera Novel,"You wouldn't think that an author who was a judge would write a women's story, but here it is. Yes, the heroine is a lawyer, but the rest of the story (told mostly in flashbacks and how can you NOT hate that?) is pure soap opera. If you like that kind of thing, this is your book. I don't and it's not my kind of book."
4,"Sparse, elegant music, very well played","I bought this disc after buying the Steeldrivers and reading reviews of that great, great CD. One of the reviewers mentioned a CD that the fiddle player had recorded earlier.The description is a bit misleading in that it suggests this is just a percussionist with the fiddle player/vocalist from The Steeldrivers.The fact of the matter is that they bring on guest artists (many from the Dead Reckoning crowd) and the disc is a real joy. This is perfect music to cook or read to. Tammy Rogers fiddle playing is really subtle and soulful here.If you like bluegrass or Irish music, especially with a real fine fiddle, this is a great disc to own."
2,Disappointed,"I read this book after my job was terminated albeit by a VIP who was known for playing politics in the company. I've read numerous books on bullying in the workplace, on office harassment, and on job termination but this one beyond the title and impressive reviews and index didn't provide what I expected from it."
2,"not that great, especially for mac/pc inter-operation.","i had a 64mb thumbdrive which was slow, locked up OS X with large (1mb+) file transfers, and broke within a few weeks. after tons of whining and loud complaining to memorex tech support they finally agreed to replace the device, and even sent me back a 128mb in return. in the mean time i was using a lexar jumpdrive, which i HIGHLY recommend. after getting this 128mb thumbdrive back i did a benchmark on them. to copy a 34mb file it takes 137 seconds on the memorex, and 47 seconds on the lexar, both using usb1 on my powerbook. i just hope it doesn't break like the last one, but the lexar is clearly better, though i do like the form factor of the memorex better."
1,AMAZING!,"A 500% discount on limited run clothing with a high resale value!?!?!?If you're going to try to sell knockoffs, at least use the right print. This is pathetic."
3,Mostly mediocre,"The only two songs worth purchasing are ""Telling Me"" and ""Call It Clear"". Those two songs are seriously amazing, unique, life-soundtracks.The rest of the album is just.. boring. I wish that it weren't so, and I believe these guys have tons of potential."
5,sucks is good.....,"Finally, somebody who sells replacement filters for my Dirt Devil Scorpion hand-held vacuum. I looked seemingly everywhere for replacement filters for my vacuum, and finally found it here on Amazon. Not only id it the correct replacement filter, but it's inexpensive too. I'd recommend this seller for anyone who has a hard to find filter or any other vacuum part."
4,Excellent Resource,"This is the book I would recommend to someone who wants an overview of the various topics that we (certified financial planners) deal with everyday. It does a good job of covering issues like savings, retirement and estate planning -- and everything in between. This is a good place to start if you want to take control of your financial life."
2,Hopeful help,I have only read the introduction so cannot review.I do hope that it will help me understand my daily computer needs.
4,"Yes, Blues From Nashville!","Being lucky to have seen Mike Henderson play in clubs here in Nashville for the last ten to fifteen years, I was exicited to get cd quality music from those guys. Give Me Back My Wig, When I Get Drunk, and Hip Shakin' are my favorite kickers of this cd. If you like blues, buy it, you can't go wrong. If you can get out to see them, go, they are great live!"
2,Highly overrated,I'm surprised so many people liked this book. It was okish but it certainly didn't deserve that award.
2,Overrated,"I really am puzzled by this book winning the Nebula award and the rave reviews here. I guess it is just my taste (or lack of it) but I found the book rather tedious, with all its details on the clothes everyone was wearing and the angst all the main characters exhibited. I did finish it, but I would not recommend this to anyone, unless they were fascinated by this period in history (and the clothing styles of the time....)"
1,No meaning,I didn't like this book because the story is too big and the character is too strong. I don't know how a book like this one can win an award
2,Not what I ordered.,Initially this was not the picture in place for this item and so I received this thinking it was a different model and had it returned and was refunded excluding my shipping costs. I set my hair with full rollers and a head of full rollers cannot fit under this hood and dry properly. So if you are purchasing this for setting your hair think twice. If you're purchasing for just drying your hair I guess it might work.
1,customer service is excellent,"The product is great,customer service seems to be of great value to carmens mall. We will order from them again in the future..."
3,Some Good Information But A Chore To Read,"I give credit to the author for researching many perspectives on education. The author takes the point of view of students, teachers and systems and is basically organized well.What is a little annoying is excessive technical manner of many of the passages and the varying styles. Statistics are good but at times they are overwhelming with limited suggestions on what can be done to improve the situation. Of course a school in the Inner City is going to fall short of one in an affluent suburb. The funding is not there. I would suggest to the author to offer concrete solutions rather than sing the the factors of poverty, race and prejudice.Its not right but offer answers to make it right. All this book offers is another account for someone's research paper."
5,Awesome!,"Farrell and Farrell's ""A Portrait of us all"" was my favorite when it first came out about a million years ago! We happened to be talking about it one night, and thought I'd look it up. It just so happened my wife's birthday was coming up, so I ordered this cd. So what if it was used, it sounds great, and now we can listen to the old favorites again and share them with the kids. I wish more of the old cassettes were on cd."
2,Read all the great reviews but...,"I finally got around to playing Thief and, given all its wonderful press, I ended up disappointed. Yes, I know the graphics engine is outdated now but even when it came out it must not have been that great. I found the constant stealth factor to actually not be that fun and found it very aggravating at times. Sometimes it takes ALOT of playing time to negotiate and area correctly without alerting the guards. I also found the player controls a little more stiff or crude or less responsive or something than most games of this nature. I played through alot of the first level and then gave up. Maybe it was a blast when it came out but now there are alot of other games that will give me much more fun and excitement. I will give Thief II a try (I already own it) but I feel it will be more of the same."
4,Fun then Frustrating then Boring,"Thief is a good game and it's fun...But the game gets very frustrating and tire-some... then it starts to get boring.The graphics are outdated. It isn't BAD, but they ain't great either.The gameplay is basically sneaking around, knocking out soldiers, finding stuff, etc. Most of the missions are VERY hard... and sometime a little TOO hard. You get weopons like a sword, a bow & arrow ...water arrows, etc. You'll usually have to steal something in the missions.The sound is great. You can hear peoples conversations, etc.The control takes time getting used to.Overall, I liked this game... but in the end it didn't turn out to be very replayable. It got boring and frustrating.Try the demo first, and see how you like it."
2,"Certainly ""Something Tragic""","The Brooker/Reid songwriting duo is my favorite of all time. This album, with its puerile spoken suite ""The Worm and the Tree"", marked the absolute low point in the band's history. If you're a Procol Harum completist, try to find this album CHEAP.Good songs are the title cut, Skating On Thin Ice, and Strangers in Space."
4,Good deal for $100,Good value for $100. Definitely not for $200 though (one star value at that price). Glass scratches easily. Small and light weight and not bad looking however. The band is cloth material and comfortable but not as durable and good looking as leather or leather look-alike materials.
3,Not a How-To Book,"A beautiful coffee table book, with high-quality photographs, but not very explicite. If you really want to learn more about gay sexual techniques, this book is not for you."
4,"Great Info, wish there was more","I enjoyed the pages of this book. The photographs were in good taste and it touched on topics like age, aids, sex and so much more. When I got this book I wished it was more about the ""sex"" plus information instead of just information plus sex. Honestly they only touch on ""sex"" a little bit and as for sexual positions, people can use their creativity ;)It was overall informative, but it is no karma sutra. I consider this a great coffee table book and something worth looking into. I would recommend previewing the book before committing to the purchase. Overall, it will be something I will keep and share with those curious enough to look past the cover :)"
1,It may be the only book on RADIUS ...,"...!...The RFCs tend to be full of nitty gritty legalese, by the very nature of their being formal specifications. That is the reason one would want to read a book, such as this one, in the hope of gaining implementation and deployment perspective that may be lacking in the the RFCs. This book does not measure up.It is poorly organized, is ridden with glaring errors, and does not explain key concepts well, if at all. If the author has brought any technical expertise on the subject matter to bear, it certainly does not show up. It looks and feels like a potpourri of hastily put together notes by a sysadmin technician; nothing more."
1,"Garbage, wasting time and money!","To be honest, I'm an O'reilly fans, while I've never read such a garbage book published by oreilly. It is just simply a garbage copy of rfc and spec. Wasting your money and time. From now on, I'll read comments about any Oreilly's book carefully b4 I manage to buy their books."
5,Excellent,Although I haven't cooked any of the meals from this book I can't wait to try them. They all look delicious and easy to make. Definately worth the cost plus some!!
2,Disappointed...,"We started watching the collection and midway through disc two, the sound goes out. My kids and I were very disappointed."
3,6 Previews You Must Sit Through On All 3 DVD's,"I am in my late twentiues but bought this set because I enjoyed it so much through my childhood. My biggest complaint, and reason for giving it 3 stars, is that each disc makes you sit through 6 previews for old and upcoming Disney movie. At my age I am not interested in Toy story, cinderella or any other Disney garbage. I think that perhaps advertising the release of chip and dales rescue rangers would have been good. Besides this complaint the DVD is pretty awesome. It leaves out the first 2 hour episode that introduced us to the Ducktails gang, but I guess we can dish out the money later for that set when disney decides to put it out. When that comes out I bet it will be filled with advertisements for some stupid Disney movie of the time."
3,Great news. . . at first. *sigh*,"I got this for Christmas, and was thrilled that DuckTales was being released on DVD. I eagerly opened up the package, looking forward to see how the nephews end up living with Uncle Scrooge. . . and found that the pilot was missing.Wow, I kept checking the DVDs thinking that there was a mistake. Perhaps they didn't pack the correct discs?Well, as others have mentioned, the lack of the pilot is VERY disappointing. I'm a huge DuckTales fan, but have even thought about returning it. I will keep it, because I love the show, but I hope the folks at Disney release the pilot episodes. It explains the premise of the entire series!It's terrible judgement on their part to leave these episodes out of the first collection on DVD. Still, if you enjoy the show, you should still purchase the set. My only hope is that they release the pilot in the future. I might even wait to rewatch the episodes until that time. It is really annoying to watch them out of order."
5,Awesome show ~ my kids love it!,"I grew up watching Duck Tales every day after school with my brother. We happened to rent it at the library one day for my kids (they're 3 & 5). The kids sat mesmerized by it. Since we didn't have much luck finding it again, we purchased this 3-disc set and it's given them hours of entertainment. I'm so glad they like the old cartoons since most of the new cartoons drive me nuts lol"
4,I have found my childhood,I love the duck tales team. Very disapointing to see that the first few episodes are not on this volume 1 looks like they are starting after the initial pilot. Very disapointing. What's the good in collecting the series. I have still rated it high because they are great to watch and remember the old times sitting home on a saturday morning.
2,Disney has a pattern,"Disney has done it again with thier box sets. Just like Chip and Dale, the begining episodes for this box set are on the volume 2 box set. It was very upsetting to me. In order to start from the begining of the cartoon i have to buy two volumes when all i have is money for the one. Disney you've been a very bad boy. The set, aside from that very irritating thing, is a great and a great addition for anyones Disney collection. Just remeber make sure your have the money to buy volume 1 and 2 at the same time the story loses it value if you don't. It jumps from heuy dewy and louie being there in volume one to Scrooge first getting them in volume two. Kinda confusing if your trying to share this classic with your children"
1,Not accurate.,"I received this and it doesn't even state that it is for a Mac on the package, and it certainly wouldn't work on my IMac"
3,"Great product, but vendor shipping price is enormous.","I used to buy this product here all the time, and I've had great service from the various vendors. Be sure, however, to check the shipping price before placing a final order. The current vendor (AmericaRx) charges half as much for shipping as for the product itself. I was able to get the same product through an allergy site for slightly less per bottle, and the shipping was less than half as much per bottle. I ended up buying FOUR bottles and having them shipped for only sixty cents more (total!) than the price of TWO bottles plus shipping on this site. ""Standard"" shipping on the other site is FedEx Ground, so shipping is fast, and you save $2.25 per bottle on shipping."
5,purchase of flag,"I would like to say that as of now I am satified with the purchase of the American Flag. If it last for the summer, I will be satified."
4,Good for Price,"Flag is thin, not luxurious, but I didn't expect it to be. Matches the favorable price. I prefer to pay less and change it more often. Good value for daily home display....and replacement periodically."
3,US flag,"Good quality flag. Fair enough for the price tag. However, it came with a little black dots on it (very tiny stains)."
2,Flimsy with shoddy workmanship. How much are you willing to compromise?,"This item was shipped and received within a week.It's a poorly sewn and printed flag. It's a really flimsy thin polyester material that feels almost as thin as tissue. I ironed and pressed it but couldn't get all the wrinkles out. The sewing on this flag is off; the top and bottom are sewn just a little too short for the flag to lay completely flat when placed on a flat surface. This causes the flag to pucker in many places, if you like the rippled look then this is the flag for you. The ripples make it look like it's in the wind, even though it's hanging on a wall indoors. I only paid $5 for the flag, it's true what people say, you get what you pay for."
1,I wish there was a poorer THAN POOR rating,Wrong item shipped. Took 4ever to get here. I was an idiot and did not realize this product was coming from another country.NEVER buy from these people. NEVER NEVER NEVER. Product was also of POOR quality. CHEAP. Won't even waste my time to try and exchange it
2,Cheap Quality,"The flag looks better in the picture, but when you open the box, prepare for dissapointment. I purchased 7 flags to present to my family upon my return home from Afghanistan. I refuse to give my family these flags as a gift. Now I am stuck with them because it is not worth it to send them back. The only reason they did not get 1 star is because they shipped fast."
2,U.S. Flag,The flag is a decent price and the delivery was fast. My problem is that the flag came with one of the grommets not attached to the material.
3,Very Thin Quality,"Its not thick, very thin and see through but, you get what you pay for. At least it was cheap and when you fold it you cant tell the difference."
5,Lovely story for kids of all ages,I love this story. It is great for reading out loud! I have bought it for numerous nieces and nephews. I hope you fall in love with the red ranger just like me.
3,Not a bad toy,"I bought this toy for my one and a half year old, and I found the pieces to be a little bit small, I had to watch her like a hawk so she wouldn't put them in her mouth. She liked watching me play with it, but she never really got excited about using it herself."
2,Belt Clip would be better than Arm Wrap,"I have seen this product and planned to purchase it. However I found out that only a velcro wrap is avalaible, no belt clip. Too bad it is perfectly designed to fit the waist and a belt clip would have been preferred."
5,"Wonderful, exciting glimpse into the days of Elizabeth I","The Elizabethan Age, the last of the Tudors, the first days of colonial expansion, the tension between the European powers, the birth of Protestantism, and the first stirrings of the Renaissance -- all of these come into focus and come together in this very readable, exciting tale of a remarkable woman, born in a turbulent time. This book could easily be a great read-aloud for a family of children, from pre-readers to adolescents. It begs to be shared aloud."
4,Behind the Mask: The life of Queen Elizabeth 1,I was expecting more detailed historical information...although the illustrations were beautiful. It seemed as if much of her history was not included
3,Juvenile book marketed to adults....,"This book offers alot of information on the great Virgin Queen as well as beautiful reprints of portraits of Elizabeth I. Unfortunately, this book sounds like it was written for adolescents, not for adults. The grammar in some places is awkward as well as some of the observations (i.e. pg. 156: ""The sixteenth century preceded by several hundred years the development of electricity and the telegraph, telephone, radio, and other rapid means of communication."") This is good for teenagers and for those who simply want an easy read but it's not very sophisticated for the reading level of an average adult. I'm glad I bought this used!"
1,Fun game but two times it breaks on me.,"This game is fun, but I don't know what the heck, this game faults and goes multi-colored screen on me 1/4 a way through it. It has happened to me twice now with two separate discs that have never been touched. This is the only game that does this on my 360."
1,I dont know who gave the good reveiws,"This game is terrible. True it is sort of new and inventive. But gameplay is terrible, graphics are equiv. to regular Xbox. I have purchased this game in package just to get the Xbox 360. Also stay away from ridge racer (terrible driving game, the worst i have ever played) driving physics are non existent and gameplay is designed for five year olds. Perfect Dark Zero is also terrible. All of these games have received great reviews. I dont know how? All have graphics dated back to the original Xbox!!!! Hope this helps!"
3,great game on an expensive console,"now, I've got to admit, I DID play a demo of this at K-mart. I was pleased with the great graphics, awesome combat, and whimsical story. BUT, I don't have am XBOX 360. why? the price is completely expensive. If Microsoft doesn't do anything to make money and lower the price any time soon, I'm going to be ticked. I'd hate to miss out on having a game console that has the best graphics on it. But if the company doesn't do anythingabout it, I'm going to be ticked. Microsoft, you just got SERVED!"
4,SATISFIED TRANSACTION,"Package arrived quickly and book as described. Content is helpful and has colorful pages. Wish I could have paid less, but ""oh well"". I will enjoy using it to teach other students the craft of clown makeup."
3,Kid's Shopping Cart,My son just loves pushing the kid size shopping cart in Harris Teeters so much that I had to get this for him. I do agree with others that the wheels get stuck but for my three year old it is perfect. I realize I probably would have to spend a little more to get what is actually at the grocery store.
2,Another day in the life of Gentry,"Probably a mistaken impression, but when I read book 3- I thought we were going to see some interaction with the high court seelie- the entire thing seemed to be leading to a party with Meredith going head to head with Taranus.In book4, there was nothing.... The entire book would have made a mildly boring first chapter."
1,"If you are looking for plotless erotica, this is the book fo","I have read all her books and I love her writing style, but enough is enough. In both the Anita Blake series and the Merry Gentry series each new book has more sex and less plot. Don't get me wrong. I like the sex, but plot makes it better. I have read other well-written erotic novels, but I got bored since there was no plot. Initially, the Merry Gentry novels seemed to have it all; well-written, plot and steamy sex. It's a rich world, with nice mythological tie ins, but it went nowhere in this book or the last, and it's clear that the next book can only be the 4 or 5 other guys and girls she's promised to sleep with before dawn. I am sick of it. Reading the book all I kept thinking was ""Stop screwing and do something"" Hamilton is obviously a talented writer, but she's losing some long term fans."
2,Just out to sell books,"This the 4th book in the Gentry stories is by far the worst of the lot. The entire book covers less than 24 hours in time and barely edges the plot forward. Laurell writes like she's trying to extend the series out over as many books as possible just to sell more books. The multi chapter sex scenes while steamy filled probably close to 1/2 of the entire book. Yes, I know she makes her money selling books. But I for one will glance through her next addition to this series before I buy it in hardback."
2,To much is a bad thing,"I agree with most of the reviews, this book in particular was too filled with sex. I like the mystery, I love the politics with a sprinkling of sex. I also grow weary of her repeatedly explaining the same thing over and over again. I know she was raised by her father and I know she visited the Goblin kingdom many times, I know the rules she keeps explaining over and over again. Get to the point."
1,don't buy it,"I kept my promise to myself and did NOT buy this book. I read it in the bookstore in about 30mins. No plot, nothing but sex. I was amused to see other LKH books in the romance section ... where they belong. Thanks to Amazon's ""you might also like"" I have found many other authors who exceed LKH. I am so dissapointed with both the Gentry and the Blake series. The original concepts for both were so good, what a waste."
3,Where's the Rest of My Book?,"As with most reviewers here I am a big LKH fan. I own all of her books and have her releases marked in my day planner. The Merry Gentry series is my favorite - I actually read them before I picked up Anita Blake. I was on pins an needles waiting for this book - when I finished it I was still on pins and needles - no fix...I kept searching for the rest of my book. There was no resolution and way too many unanswered questions. You are introduced to characters and then never see them again despite them becoming part of her merry band of guards. By the end of the previous installment one expected some type of journey, but this novel had none. The entire thing takes place in one day - which left me breathless trying to sort everything out. I highly recommend rereading the previous novel in the series as it is cryptically referred to several times.All in all the book is worth reading for Merry's magical development, but not for much else."
1,Continues to cater to the lowest common denominator...,"I give up -- I'll be saving my money from now on. Hamilton just can't get past her current trend of using her female characters as vehicles for her lame sex fantasies, and I'm BORED, BORED, BORED. You can't even like these people, in this series or the Anita Blake novels, both of which illustrate Hamilton's lack of scholarly versatility. Different clothes, different color hair, same slutty character. Sad to see a good writer deteriorate to this."
2,I continue to be disappointed with her latest books,"I really enjoyed LKH's books up until a year or two ago, when both series degenerated into a lot of sex scenes and much less plot. This book is sadly more of the same. I found myself getting bored an hour into it. LKH can write great books but I don't think this was one of them."
1,This is a waste,"I don't want to be harsh. really I don't. But this is too much.....What are LKH's editor(s) doing? Shouldn't somebody tell her to stop babbling and go on? Yes, this book surely has enough smart and exotic sex scenes. But I didn't buy it to see a porno with almost NO plot and too much sex!It does starts with a murder case, but they don't solve it. The murderer's out in the end but not because anybody tried.All in all, this is a waste. A waste of time, money, and LKH herself."
3,Borders on porn,"This book let me down. I think she's loosing the plot somewhat. As porn it's great, as urban fantasy about fairies, your better off reading Emma Bull (war for the oaks) or Kim Wilkins (the autumn castle). Three stars and I'll probbly still buy the next one."
2,"She's pretty, but that is about it.","PDZ has very weak gameplay. It's just not a fun game to me. The controls are rubbish and the reticle has to be so spot on, that it's just plain tedious. Maybe I am a HALO NERD, that's fine, but I will wait for the return of the MASTER CHIEF. Ms. Dark is pretty, but she lacks heart, agility, and controllability. I think we are reaching the point in game development where companies are surrendering gameplay for graphics. PDZ makes me sad."
1,This game is for Five year olds...cheezy graphics....,"This game is terrible. True it is sort of new and inventive. But gameplay is terrible, graphics are equiv. to regular Xbox. I have purchased this game in package just to get the Xbox 360. Also stay away from ridge racer (terrible driving game, the worst i have ever played) driving physics are non existent and gameplay is designed for five year olds. Perfect Dark Zero is also terrible. All of these games have received great reviews. I dont know how? All have graphics dated back to the original Xbox!!!! Hope this helps!"
4,Rea really good,"From the opening track Square Peg Round Hole, there is a scent in the air that Chris Rea still knows how to punch out a great tune. With his trademark gravelly vocals and superb slide guitar, you know that Rea can always deliver. With songs such as On The Beach and Let's Dance, Chris Rea found success, using simple melodies and riffs to create wonderful music. The Blue Cafe is no different - from the slide guitar on As Long As I Have Your Love to the upbeat rhythm of the title track, Chris Rea still performs excellently. Highlights of the album include the riffy Square Peg, the Bond-esque strings of Shadows Of The Big Man and even the solo of Thinking Of You will make the most earnest toe tap. It is true that this album, whilst being musically terrific, also has something for everyone, so it would be hard not to like this if you aren't a fan already!! Definite entertainment."
1,My fuzzies aren't interested =(,I hope other fuzzies are interested in this item because my girls could really care less. They haven't given it a second glance since I put it in their cage.
4,Saigon Is Talented,"This cd is a good listen. It sounds like an album. There is a good variety of subject matter on Warning Shots. I like the ""Favorite Thingz"". This artist made a good cd but its only a mixtape, which should have been an album....."
1,I did not like,Do not have a strong odor or smell Alvanlia appear in cakesAnd very few in number and their price is highI did not like
3,free. worth a read.,"the start of the book just killed me. the main character is so slow to react, with paragraphs of useless prose detailing his thoughts about what he saw, if it was real, then on to what people would think of him in a negative light for saving someone from drowning. The book isnt bad! just frustrating for a detail and action orriented person like me."
4,Wonderfull CD - Guitar music at its best.,"This is a good addition to the Narada's New Flamenco series a long with Gypsy Passion and Gypsy Soul. Track 8 & 11 (Abundance and Tigris Palace) are my favorites, I just can't get enough of those 2 songs, that music is always in my head, the rest of the songs are ok too. I wish that this collection could include Alex Fox, how could Narada miss him on a collection like this? The sound quality is exceptional thanks to the 24-bit mastering, this is even beter than the 20-bit recording in Gypsy Passion and Gypsy Soul and I thought that Gypsy Passion's sound was excellent already. If you like this ""Obsession"", I'm sure you will like Gypsy Passion too. Just sit back, relax and let the music take you away to an exotic destination !"
2,Unsatisfying if you're looking for flamenco,"Pleasant and mildly enjoyable but it hardly qualifies as flamenco. Excellent musicianship but the pieces lack any real fire or passion. I'll listen to it every now and then, but I'll keep looking for something closer to what I heard in Spain."
1,Pleasant ... just not on me!,"Paris Hilton is not easy to wear, imo. If you can wear this, congratulations. The apple and melon are REALLY nice, reminding me of the best quality of Coty's Exclamation & Coty's Forbidden Fruit. I like smelling this on others, even if I can't stand the egomaniacal celeb.There is something freaky about the juice that doesn't sit well. For me, there's a chemical note in Paris Hilton that when I sniff it, it's almost like it jabs my sensitive back molars. There's a metallic taste to it too. I frequently have problems with white florals, but it's not the jasmine & tuberose causing it. It's something else. If it wasn't for that freaky note, I would wear this regularly, in spite of the white florals.I so wish that this worked for me, even if the flacon is 1970s Avon tacky. Thankfully, the bottle was really cheap but I ended up giving the bottle away."
1,IMPORTANT!! DONT BUY!! FAKE!! Doesn't smell like real retail perfume!!,"This Paris Hilton perfume was bought for my fiance that has worn it for years. I gave it to her for Christmas and she swore it didn't smell like it usually does. I kept telling her she was nuts and she kept insisting it didn't smell the same so I went to a local retail store and bought a bottle today and sure enough it smells different. Amazon is ripping people off! It also makes sense now as to why the box wasn't shrink wrapped. Weird. According to Amazon it is considered ""hazardous"" to ship back and receive a refund so I am calling customer service tomorrow and insisting on one. DON'T BUY!!!"
1,Great...,"This is a great perfume... if you want to smell like skank. Why is this chick famous, anyway???"
1,rosiris -venezuela,quisiera saber cuando me van entregar mi perfume por favor no sean unos tramposo necesito respuesta al respecto por favor
2,Questioning authenticity,"I have worn this perfume before. When I received this from amazon I was very pleased with the packaging and the fact that it arrived in a prompt manner. With that being said, it does not smell the same as my previous Paris Hilton perfume. Just to let you guys know, Paris Hilton perfume does not last very long at all. But this scent from amazon is practically non existent after 5 minutes. (no exaggeration). It definitely makes me question the authenticity and my loyalty to Amazon.com."
1,NOT ORIGINAL SCENT,WOW!! THIS IS NOT A ORGINAL PARIS HILTON SCENT.. SMELLS HORRIBLE! WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAINDO NOT BUY FROM THEM THE SMELL IS NOT THE SAME!!!!!!!!!!I WILL RETURN THIS ITEM BACK
4,How to Rent Vacation Properties,Great book for beginners. Very thorough but for more detailed information about financial savings talk to your accountant. It has alot of ideas and information for setup of house design for attractiveness AND information for setup for business.
5,Album of the Year,"Listening to this disc evoked a reaction that was hinted at in their (excellent) earlier work, but never fully developed until now: I felt that the music was being drawn OUT of my consciousness rather than being forced IN. Emotional minimalism, involved detachment, serious whimsy, challenging accessibility. Brilliant!"
2,Shipped Broken,Can't say much about it other than it was shipped to me with one of the arms broken off. How do you screw that up?
1,Was supposed to be a refurbished Lexmart cartridge,"Not a lexmart refurnbished cartrige wont work with the printer, waste of money. Keep getting error messaage from the printer not recognizing the cartrige"
5,"Great Price, arrived quickley, works perfectly",Original manufacturere cartridges usualy work the best and last the longest so when you can find them at a realy good price it is a good investment. Because we all know they could give you the printer and make a great profit selling you the ink cartridges!
4,It works!,This baby is still installed on the back of my truck and I haven't had any issues towing with it. It was generally easy to install (ok I didn't personally install it...that is what my ex husband is for haha).It was delivered in good time and good shape
2,Helpless,"If somebody knows why these kind of recordes are been realesed i would like to know... first the sound is very bad designed and mixed (phill did it himself and thats the reason why) it sound like a bunch of demoes. some of the songs need more work and you can not escape of imagening what could have happen if L.A guns put their hands of these stuff with a good producer as they did on ""vicious circle"". the album is full with ballads and based on drums,bass,guitar and little keyboards and really save your cash for a better produce album from this tallented guy."
5,It's a long way to heaven~ a great cd,"I first stumbled on this cd about 5 years ago,and it has never left my changer.The cd starts of with Lillian,and never lets upfor great songs,I mean they are all great.So I would suggest that you beg, steal or borrow to get this disc, you will not be disappointed."
5,"Traumatic, funny, devastating","These are the most electric scripts to arrive in a long while. Sadly, the source was snuffed in 1999. Kane's writing is at once repellent and seductive. ""Blasted"" is exceptional, riffing on Beckett blatantly, but still signature of a visionary voice: inyerface, exuberant, filthy, poetic, profound. As a debut, it is truly remarkable. ""Phaedra's Love"" and ""Cleansed"" push the envelope past the hyper-real into lightning-bright brilliance, and with thunderous emotional depth. How does one stage this stuff? Kane's challenging work sets the imagination--and ultimately, the soul--on fire."
4,Asian lamp,"This is a great lamp because of its simple, tastful design, ease of installation, and effective lighting function.I love it and was very pleased with it when it arrive. I do wish it had been a bit larger in all dimensions, but for the price it is a welcome addition to my dining area."
3,might be time for a change,"When the chicken soup stories first started coming out, they were great. I am sure there are still good stories to be told, and while there are a few in this collection, they are few and far between even though spread out over the year. It might be spread a little bit too thin..."
2,"A fan, but I didn't like these films. Yuck!! The worst.","I am a long time Abbott and Costello fan. I grew up watching their films on sunday mornings. I've seen all their films, but this one for me, is not one of the best. In fact, I have no hesitation in saying that these two films are their worst. Africa Screams was their first film. Hence, they're not the stars of the film. Jack and the Beanstalk is just plain stupid. One thing in common with all the Abbott and Costello films is that all of them are funny; some of them are funnier than others. Some are just outright funnier; this is not one of them."
1,"Wrong, All wrong","It will not plugin and is the wrong cable for the job at all, if you wanted an old school cable link for the gameboy color, this is not it."
2,disappointed chapter,"I did a comparison on the 'JAAS' with Oreilly's Java Security (second ed.) and found the later to be better. This book has one brief example about JAAS(same as Oreilly's), however, all the author did is to explain what is needed for the next step, then goes by the sample code. One the other end, Oreilly's book give you a better understanding on how JAAS can be used and how it is pratically deployed by admin/programmer. I prefer ""Java Security"" than ""Profressional Java Security"" by how professionally author has presented the same topic."
4,"good product, poor packageing","the nupastels are a nice product but prismacolor should learn to use foam for the sticks instead of those hollow trays. when i ordered the first box quite a few were broken, i returned the box of pastels. amazon sent me another box, still with brokenpastels. i'm not going waste my time to send them back, because i would like to use them sometime this year."
4,"Avengers, Judge Dread, and the others","The main reason I tracked down a copy of this old game collection was for a working version of The Avengers pinball that included the video segments. I used to play these games all the time on my old Win98 machine, and had always remembered just how much I enjoyed a few of the layouts. Avengers Pinball is seriously one of the best pinball games of all time in my opinion, with Judge Dread coming in a strong second (especially if you like multiball play). The rest? Well, as far as I'm concerned, the rest are pretty much there to fill up space. I've had a few decent plays of World Cup, but the rest are all bad physics on bad layouts.The game runs tolerably well on Vista. At least on my single core processor machine it does. Takes forever to load, and there are a few video glitches, but nothing that can't be overcome with clever use of the esc and enter keys.All in all, if you're a fan of pinball games from the 90's. I'd recommend picking up a copy."
5,500 Million Stars for KM Grant!,"I have to begin this review explaining that I am an AVID reader.... I have been reading one book a day since second grade...I was reading His Dark Materials by fourth grade.....the point I am trying to make here is that I read ALOT....and Green Jasper, is a book that AMAZED me..I know that alot of people think that I'm crazy, but I dont understand how somene can NOT love this book.....Ellie, Will, Gavin, Kamil and Hosanna's emotions, are expressed very well, and the events that take place aren't unrealistic. The very real events that occured during the time such as the crusades, only help you immerse yourself in the story. All in all, this is an AMAZING buy....as is Blood Red Hose, the first book in the DeGranville Trilogy"
1,this product showed up in the suggestion but it is not the correct filter for my vacuum.,"The only reason i bought this is because it showed up in the suggestion, thinking that it is the right filter refill for my vacuum but it turns out, it is not."
3,Where does all the dirt go?,"This is a powerful, roaring beast. But it has the defect of all vacuum cleaners that do not have bags to capture the dirt it draws out and up. After the first swoop that draws the dirt up, the second and third discharge it on the floor/rug again. Bring back our bags. I have an ancient Hoover sweeper with bags and it is my treasure, despite its age. And it's made of steel."
2,kindle format stinks,"Regardless of the content of the book, the kindle format is the worst I have ever seen in any downloaded book.On my Galaxy S3, the page breaks drop sentences inbetween pages and I have to rescale the text size and backtrack to find out what just got dropped. Text dropping happens regardless of text size selected, so the only way to see what was dropped is to constantly toggle between different text sizes and different pages. This occurs at every single page break, so it not just an occasional annoyance.I have never seen this kind of persistent problem with any other kindle books. It renders the book virtually unreadable."
4,Wow!,I learned a whole lot about the history of the Penius that they don't tell you anywhere else! And I'm only in Chapter 2! Nicely written and easy to follow. Reads like a story rather than a weighty text book.
3,Low quality,"You get what you pay for in this case. After about 6 months, my dutch oven looks like it has been through a war (and it has only been used a couple times). I am going to have to buy another one. Just considering whether to buy a whole new set or just replace each piece one by one."
1,Blast from past,"Love this exercise video, wore my first one out. Got this one and was very happy with it the first time I used it, the second time it broke:(."
1,BAD COMPATIBILITY ISSUES,"I do audio restoration and conversion for a living, therefore, when I burn CD's they are played by my clients on MANY different brands of CD players. I have had COUNTLESS complaints that these things won't play on SO MANY CD players, that I can't use them. They play on my $3200.00 Sony ES777, and on my OPPO Universal Disc Player, but they won't play on my brand new Alpine car deck. They also won't play on COUNTLESS other CD players that my clients use, and I have had TONS of complaints and have had to do TONS of work over again for them. This NEVER happens with ALL the other brands I have used. ALSO, don't let the cool black look of these CD's fool you. They are flimsy in nature, and they peel. Can't believe Memorex would put a product like this on the market. If they work on YOUR CD player, fine, but if you plan on burning CDs to give as presents or to clients, if you are a professional, don't take the chance that these CDs will be compatible with their CD player."
2,well...not what I thought,"When I saw these I thought they were the old one's that Memmorex used to sell. Memorex used to be a really good brand for media, but their CD-Rs just keep getting flimsier and flimsier. I got these because the old black labels were really thick and lasted a long time. They also held up great to scratching. The new ones are cheap and the top often peals off which is even worse then a scratch on the bottom. These seem to be as flimsy and cheap as the regular ones except black. I would now choose a different media such as TDK, but unfortunately my old car stereo only prefers Memorex for some reason.The last 100pk spindle of Memorex CD-Rs I got werent black but seem the same. Almost everyone has the top peeling or flaking off somewhere eventhough they were kept in a case most of the time. And again, when the top peels off it seems to be much worse than a scratch (Data is completely lost). Too bad a great brand turned to crap."
1,Junk,Poor sound quality & first one wouldn't charge. Replaced by Amazon (great customer service). Second one shuts off every time handset is opened. Giving up & returning it.
2,great show but little substance,"the size is nice and the package is very attractive as are the sound options...however the ESP2 protection is still far from being reliable, this unit only has skip protection if you are walking very slowly and carrying the unit in your hand...try carrying it in your bag or walking fast with it and you get something that skips more than a delirious pre-adolescent...very unsatisfying..."
2,Frustrating!,"I swear the author of this book goes out of his way to make its readers feel incompetent. While full of useful information, this book is also just as full of typos and inconsistancies.Do you want to know how frustrating it is to try and re-create a page using the code given to you in a book, have the page come out looking nothing like the example in said book, then finding out the reason for the discrepency is because the author actually coded their example differently? Well there's plenty of opportunities in this book!I now have to learn inline CSS which I believe might have been covered to some extent in this book. I can't remember. That's how badly I want to forget this book! I'm sticking with CSS for Dummies!"
5,Get To Know Yourself!,It is a very informative book . It is accurate in its assessments using numbers as a basis. Fascinating! An excellent read!
3,"Good, but not great","Like some others, this is the first Lorenzo Carcaterra book I've read. It was a nice read, but just seemed familiar...I've read it before in other books of this genre."
1,Cardboard Godfather,"This book explains why there are so many poorly written books on the market: when you read it, you realize that even you can do better. How 'bout howlers like, ""...boiling under the surface, coiled like a..."" --ever hear of mixed metaphors? Or ""...muscle-thin, with jet dark eyes..."" Huh? ""muscle-thin""?? And what exactly are ""jet dark eyes"" other than a cliche, wrapped in a synonym. The characters are completely one-dimensional, the dialog is wooden and the story is preposterous. (Like gangsters who remain true to their wives. Didn't this guy ever watch the Sopranos? Goodfellas?) This guy doesn't have any idea about the world he's writing so badly about. Save your money."
2,Don't Bother,"I have enjoyed this authors last two novels however this is a waste of time. Cliche...Cliche....Cliche. Melodramtic writing. I suspect he really ""wrote this as a screenplay first because it is so vapid.Don't waste your time."
5,Inside the mind of a Gangster....,"Wow...i just finished this book and am so amped up right now. This was phenominal to say the least.. i wish i could give it 6 stars. I love gangster movies like The departed, Scarface, American Gangster. i decided to try out this book called Gangster since the title alone had me hooked and curious. This books takes off like a rocket but kind of piddles in the middle at a certain point and i wondered if it was worth finishing but I am SOOO glad i did. This is one of my favorite books of all time and i may go reread it again since i rechecked it out at the library. I also liked the little tidbits of information about the life of Gangsters, such as their habits and what they lie and dislike...Peace out."
4,tennis and flexibility,This is a great way to stretch for tennis. It really targets those muscles used during play.
5,Wonderful idea,This extension works wonderfully with the North States Auto Close Gate in our home. Easily slides into the gate and is very secure and stable. Great product.
3,A worthwhile subject,"This is a novel about the Union underground network of spies in the South during the Civil War. It is a story of ordinary people who took great risks to remain loyal while all those around them were rebelling. I have a great appreciation for this book because I feel loyalist in the South is a much neglected part of American history. This book uses the device of a ghost's perspective to both tell the story as a first person account and to interject present day perceptions and give hindsight explanations. Although these passages are admittedly necessary, they do cause the book to drag. The story is interesting, but there is too much lamenting about how today's world has forgotten the loyalist and unjustly idealized the South. Just tell me the story and I can figure that out myself."
5,great grill,"bought this 3 weeks ago and it works great. biggest fear was that i'd have flareups. i previously owned a holland grill that uses entirely indirect heating. but... you lose that char flavor with the holland, not to mention those eye-catching grill sear marks. tried the new weber and have had no flare-ups that have burned and wrecked the meat. there are some minor ones, but nowhere near bad enough to wreck your dinner. i now have those nice grill marks AND great char flavor in my burgers and steaks. BEST OF BOTH WORLDS!!"
5,Worth spending a lot of time with,"I had this from the library and now I want a copy, so I can go slowly through the meditative practices described. I particularly liked the ""light"" meditations.One of the book's best features is the focus on bringing back into everyday life what you have gained by stepping out of everyday life. This is an important perspective often missing from contemplative works.Khan quotes freely, and knowledgeably, from Hindu, Buddhist and Christian ideas as well as giving a good introduction to his Sufi tradition. The only flaw I noted is that his grasp of physics, even for metaphorical purposes, is extremely poor, but you can ignore that and just enjoy the spiritual wisdom."
1,Kindle Version Aweful,I downloaded this book to my Kindle. It seemed as if this was an unedited version. Place names changed back and forth. It was full of misspellings. Truly distracting. I returned it and never finished. I have read paper books by the same author and they were never like this. VERY disappointed.
2,Not one of Linda Lael Miller's best books/stories.,I find the story line a bit disjointed and impersonal....Ms. Miller's books are often centered around characters one can identify with. Megan/Gloriana seems superficial...more preoccupied with sex than with character. It is quite difficult to explain her attraction to her husband. (I read this book today and cannot recall the name of her husband).
2,Posing as SF,"This novel did not work for me. The plot was built around a silly premise, and several idiotic notions. Cornell, as a character, seemed like a two-dimensional cardboard cut-out, and gave me absolutely no sense of feeling for him. At the end, I felt like I had been stuffed full of too much Sweet 'n' Low - the book had a few good ideas and themes stuffed in behind the rest, but not nearly enough to constitute anything of any real worth. However, out of everything bad I've said about the book, it earns an extra star because of the author's writing style. While I didn't enjoy the book, I did like the style of writing the author used to elaborate on those ideas. Unfortunately, this is one of Reed's better novels. Which isn't saying much."
5,makes the reader think about his real purpose in reality,"""beyond the veil of star"" a book solely for those who haven't forgotten what dreaming was all about. The world of dreams has no defined landscape exept the mind which is limitless, robert reed takes me back to a childlike state in the nostalgia of this book."
4,Mr. Grinch outfit,"The Grinch outfit matched the description. The Grinch mask needed some way to fastenit on the head so that the mask did not move around so much. Also, the mask needed biggereye holes, and a vent in the mouth for breathing. The santa jacket was very large in size."
4,Delightful,"Lynn Flewelling's first instalment of 'Luck in the Shadows', by now become a classic of the genre, is a delightful début to what becomes a rich and compelling series. Flewelling is no Tolstoy as a writer, and the text contains not a few infelicities of style and a very many typographical errors; but these do not impede the novel's quick, snappy, and easily likable tone. On which subject: there is a lot of plot in 'Luck in the Shadows', but not a lot of direction to it. Events pile after each other with little sense of multi-layered, interconnected story elements waiting in the wings to unfold; but this loose organization works surprisingly well, for 'Luck in the Shadows' does not pretend to be anything but a prelude: an introduction to Flewelling's well-conceived and compelling fantasy world, and a rich foretaste of the characters we will grow so attached to in later instalments, with a healthy dose of ominous foreshadowing. Light, delicious, and filling fare."
5,A GREAT BOOK!,"I *love* this series, and I don't think I can stress that enough. From someone who really hates to read normally, I couldn't put it down. The characters are wonderful, and I really felt a lot for them. It's really not your typical fantasy novel. And it's just a really fun book. I loved it. You have to read it!!"
3,better then toothpicks,"I got these for my son, who lost the ones to his game. He how has a newer DS so he has plenty. Personally, other then building hand/eye co=ordination video games are psychologically addictive, contribute to pre-adualecent violence, and make gamers lazy, stupid and indolent(look it up).In my opinion it is the revenge of a certain Oriental country we fought during the last world war(I won't name names, they know who they are and they are getting the last laugh). Whatever, my Dad was in the army during that war and might have colored my opinion. I'm sure they're fine people for the most part and almost had a chance to visit there on my honeymoon, but my bride had a fear of flying.Oh, well."
2,"Not the worst film of all time, but I turned it off before the end i was so bored","A group of college kids who cant act for *bleep* are studying a recently found mummy from the Aztecs. The plot bores on to find one of the kids who really cant act is a high Aztec priest who brings the mummy back to life and it kills of the kids one by one till the usual end happens.I couldn't stand the way any of these kids talked, I think they spent more money on the effects then they did bothering to hire any one who even knew somebody who had been to acting school.About halfway through I was just bored and couldn't take anymore of the bad dialog and turned it off. How the movie ended, I don't know, I don't care.Avoid this *bleep* at all costs unless you are an inspired bad movie maker in the making."
5,"Same product, fraction of the price","When available, these are generally around $25 in Target (however they're generally sold out)Here, they're just over 6 bucks and always available. It's a no-brainer.Fits perfectly into my Dirt Devil upright."
2,Doesnt fit / Just ok,When i purchased this refill i thought it would fit to my dirt devil vacuum but i know why it doesnt fit at all.So instead of returning it i just put something to hold unto it.Now i can use.Well the price is affordable so i think its worth the price.
5,first order with amazon,Just a brief message to those who are thinking about ordering from Amazon. Everything from ordering to receiving the product went very smoothly.Will order again from them in the future.Dirt Devil Universal HEPA Filter for Bagless Uprights
5,just as described,thank you . this works greAT and alot cheaper than the ones from sears... you even beat walmart prices... i will keep buying these from you...
3,Check the seller and brand,"This filter fits the Dirt Devil vacuum I have; however I thought I was buying a Dirt Devil original filter (since the item states ""by Dirt Devil""), but the manufacturer is EnviroCare technologies and the seller is GoVacuum."
1,Does NOT fit models prior to 2003!,"This filter, apparently, fits all Dirt Devil models manufactured after 2002, and NONE made prior to 2003 regardless of model number. To get a filter for your Dirt Devil vacuum manufactured prior to 2003, you will need to call Dirt Devil directly; it can not be purchased through ANY web site nor can one find any information for the appropriate part. Why Dirt Devil changes the designs of its machines, but retains the same model number is a frustrating enigma."
5,Dirt Devil HEPA Filter,This product is much much 200% better quality than the original filter I had with Dirt Devil.
5,Works great~,"I was a little worried that at the low price this might not work/fit, but it is wonderful! It is very snug to get on the machine but I was able to accomplish it even though my arthritic hands were bothering me. GREAT buy!!"
5,Dirt Devil Filters,"I have no complaints whatsoever about these filters. The quality is good if not better than the Dirt Devil brand which is approx 2/3 higher in price. If you purchase a larger qty (4 for example), the shipping rates are very reasonable and well worth it."
3,so so,The filter arrived a few days ahead of the estimated arrival date. The filter itself is generic and unfortunately has a loose fit and moves around in the vacuum. Next time I'll spend the extra money to get a name brand filter.
4,Dirt devil F1 Hepa filter,"This is not an official Dirt Devil filter, but it works just fine. The official Dirt Devil filter is about $22 at Target. The fit on my vacuum is not as tight as the original, but it does not fall off. After replacing my old filter with this item, the suction power of my vacuum was a lot more powerful. I got worried about my allergies to dust with this new filter, but my allergies were under control. This is a great product for the price."
5,Dirt Devil 3JC0280000 Universal HEPA Filter for Bagless Uprights,"Filters arrived promptly, work well and are about half the price of purchasing in a store."
4,Good Value,Difficult to find and usually more expensive than buying or replacing the vacumn. I purchased two and I'll be in good shape for a year or more.
1,Didn't fit,"I could not find a model number for my dirt devil bagless, but I did know it was a ""vision lite"" model. I decided to order this and when I got it I realized it looked nothing like my old filter. I read the package it came in and it did say it works with ""vision models."" I took it out, tried to fit it where my old one was, and it wasn't even remotely close to fitting.Rather than return it I cut out some of the internal skeleton work, used a knife to expand the circumference about a half inch, and eventually got it to fit.I wouldn't recomend purchasing this product unless you are 100% sure it fits. I think some more description is necessary before people can make proper judgement."
2,Did not pull me into the story,The game did not pull me into the story so I only played it about 30 minutes. It is still sitting on the shelf. Maybe I will get to it and give it a chance one day.
3,what happened to Joanna Dark?,"I have to start with saying I have always been a fan of perfect dark since it first came across my hands on N64. This is a completely different game with the exception of a couple of gadgets and the presence of datadyne. I purchased this hoping to reminisce with an old standby, but I got a completely new experience. This normally would not be a big deal however, this franchise has been around for awhile. Why such drastic changes? I was also unimpressed with the graphics. The best looking items in the game were Joanna's pink fingernails. I was hardly able to keep myself engaged through the first three missions. Disappointing. :-("
2,Limited usefulness,"Disappointed in this book. Great if you know the diagnosis and want a reference for a typical appearance of an entity, but as a review book, very suboptimal. Gives a few key points about each diagnosis but DOES NOT LIST A DIFFERENTIAL. Also does not discuss treatment options. Overall, a very limited resource and not what I was hoping for."
1,NO disrespect to the first reviewer but............,"Stop living off an artist's past. I understand Canibus might be a great talent, but just accept the fact that Canibus doesn't have it in this particular album. AS an emcee he's only reached the level of mediocrity. I think this album pushed his level way down. None of his albums has ever surpassed even the slightest breakthrough status. Can-I-Bus lacked the production AND the album was monotonous throughout every single damn song. The second album was a little above descent. The lyrics were damn near incredible but lacked the variety of topics a good album needs. So let us face the fact that Canibus will probably never make a hiphop album that balances out with his potential."
1,Dissapointment!,"I can't believe this is the same guy who ripped apart LL cool j just a few years ago! His lyrics have hit a all time low and the production is even worst than any one his first two albums. I can't possible see someone tell me, that any one of these tracks off his new album is anywhere near as lyricaly equal to even some of his worst work from any other album he's put out. The beats and production is so weak it's just childish! What Can-I-bus needs to do is hook up with some real production, like DJ Premier or whoever produces MOP. He needs some beats that just bumps, so that he can than just spit his, at times, incredible lyrical assasination on whoemever he pleases."
1,What Happened?,"Canibus is amazing, this album was made by trash. In 2000 BC canibus came strong and blew everything up. In C true hollywood story. Canibus sounds like a kid with his friends recording an album in their basement.People say that this album is purposefully weak so that his spring release will be even more powerful. Well Canibus will be lucky if anyone picks up his spring album. And that is a tired excuse for a weak album, weak weak weak trash."
3,He ain't with the majors no more,"Let's give Canibus a chance, he said it himself that he ain't with the major record co. no more. This album was far short of showing the lyrical capability of 'Rip The Jacker', the man I consider to be the tightest lyricist of all time but I'll give him time to adjust. I feel that Canibus was looking for support from his true hardcore fans just to get money off this album to produce the next that he says Timberland is working on. And yes, he should go commercial if he's going to stay in the industry at all. That's what economics is making hardcore figgaz do now just to stay on the airwaves. I'll get his next album no doubt but that's as far as I'm going to wait for him to shine."
3,no book,"Iguess it would be ""OK"" however, I can't review becasue I never recieved the book from the amazon vendor."
5,Damn good hip-hop from an emcee from... Connecticut!?!?!,"Yeah. Ap holds it down with sick flow, tight wordplay, and great storytelling. Only wish I had heard his stuff on 88.9 when they were still playing good stuff over 4 years ago.Luckily for me, I stumbled upon him through 7L & Esoteric this year who I remember being mentioned all the time but never heard them on 88.9.Buy it."
1,Like Produces Like,"There is an abundance of research that shows assault on children as well as other violence in the home is what increases the risk of delinquency and learning challenges.Children who are taught that violence is wrong and are treated with love and respect do what all children do. They do what they are taught. When children are hit, they learn that it is ok to hit others to gain power. As for using religion to justify violence, slave-owers used that tactic.Does anyone now feel that slavery is biblically sanctioned? Jesus never ever used physical force on anyone.Jesus went against all of the common place violent rituals. Many people are taught to focus on Jesus's death. However there is much to learn from his life!"
2,A sheer disappointment,"It's important to say I've been a Crystal fan for many years. That said, this release falls below even her other holiday video, which I rated ""3"" stars. This video was done a decade or so ago, and seems to tout the songs from her album ""Ain't Gonna Worry"" more than anything. It was sour to me that Crystal's singing is nothing but lip syncing set against the backdrop of Finland. Yes, beautiful scenery, but this just doesn't have the feeling of a holiday video. At least her other video made in Sweden had good holiday representations. This release seems very short of holiday spirit and long on bore."
4,OK for a bound photocopy,"This Nabu press reproduction is equivalent to a bound photocopy. The text is fairly clear and easy to read. Only on a few pages is the text blurred. The figures are very poor (OK - nearly non-existent) - so if you need the figures, don't order this reproduction. But if you need the equivalent of a bound photocopy of Smith's translation of Schwann's work, this should be satisfactory. A translation of Schleiden's Contributions to Phytogenesis is also included."
2,Mainstream wannabes,"The best way I can describe these guys are 50 cent lyrics without Dre's beats. All these guys talk about is going to the club, sex, and guns. Their flow isn't anything special and the songs are extremely repetitive. The majority of their beats are low off key minor notes with some handclapping mixed in. One of their more popular songs is ""stomp and clap."" They stomp and clap 50 times and shout out to ATL, the west coast, and new york... Wow, that's a good one guys. I'm stomping this cd out of my collection and I suggest everyone avoids this cd as well."
2,Little good/no harm,Bought to use as a holistic approach to GERD/reflux relief. It tastes horrible and did very little good. Did no harm either. Best approach to a natural remedy has been dissolving baking soda in water and drinking it PRN.
1,Not a good Product,I really tried to give this product a good run before calling it what it is.. Crap..This product almost made me abandon DGL altogether. I used the whole bottle up over about 3 weeks and the product never helped me at all. The only reason I kept taking it was because the person at the health food store told me it can take a while to work.After I finished the bottle I found a new health food store that carried a different brand. Literally 15 min after trying the new brand my stomach felt better. Plus the new brand didn't taste like a licorice root exploded in my head.Stay away from this brand.
2,"Poorly written, Unrealistic, Not even a Good Ending","This book might have been the product of Elliot Roosevelt when he was seven years old. It was very non-descriptive! One did not even know where the action was taking place in many scenes. Maybe I am too critical, but I thought that the scene where Mrs. Roosevelt ventures into a strip club and makes comments amd asks questions like, ""Oh, so is that what they call a G string?"" was appealing to some sore ot lowly base instincts"
1,"Cheap, but don't expect dry salad...","I got this spinner as a gift 2 years ago and it has only really ""spun"" 3 times. As a previous reviewer wrote, the inner colander rarely lines up with the lid...it took me a year to realize that when i was spinning the handle the colander inside wasn't spinning at all! hence, soggy lettuce. i say, splurge on the zyliss or oxo."
5,Where's the Beef,I'm sure it's gonna be great and I'd love to write a review for this book if they'd ever publish it....
5,Excellent resource,Very descriptive of riding techniques backed up by good photos illustrating the finer details of the techniques.Despite being a little older (late 90's) virtually all of riding techniques are still relevant. Some of the bike information and safety gear information is now a little dated but still useful nonetheless.
5,Refreshing,"I initially heard the track ""Die Schwestern"" on YouTube and had to have the CD. It doesn't disappoint. Barbara Bonney has a remarkable ability to blend and contrast her crisp soprano with any mezzo and has clearly developed a rapport with Angelika Kirchschlager. Cudos also to the pianist Malcolm Martineau whose accompaniment is witty without being either intrusive or ostentatious. An unusual collection of lieder performed by a fine, fine ensemble."
1,iPhone file is UNREADABLE,"This is a review of the iPhone digital file only, not the content of the book. (The book, I like).The file delivered is UNREADABLE. It is a mess and there is a typo on nearly every page: inserted or deleted characters, random italics, incorrect spacing.DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE."
3,A t first brilliant but finally a bit tiresome,"Ken Bruen's novels about Jack Taylor are at first radically different. The language and the sentences seem taken straight out of an alcoholic nightmare. However, the sentences are eventually drowned in drunkenness, alcoholism, cocaine, beatings, killing your friends, killing the wrong person, and on and on, over and over. After a while you ask, ""Is this all there is?"" Making a novel out of alcoholism with such brilliant language can be arresting; making a series out of alcoholism gets tiresome all too quickly.Still, the writing kept me reading long after I should have put the books down."
1,An even greater waste of my precious time.,"Picks up where The Guards left off but adds cocaine to the list of addictive personality disorders of the hero. Same problem as the first book though, Jack stays loaded the entire time, never solves the primary case he's working on, gets an innocent man killed, and leaves the reader begging for a shot in the head to put us out of our misery for reading such a load of peat that is full of fleas and better when it is burned."
1,Unbelievable disappointment,"This book is a trainwreck. To make a long story short, I doubt anyone involved in the making tried to give it a final editing. It is littered with spelling errors, and the captions misidentify the vehicles represented in the pictures. There are several, but just to name the two most glaring: a YF-23 prototype is incorrectly identified as an SR-71, and the rather large nose-mounted reaction control system boom on a Yak-36 prototype is described as a refueling boom!The text itself doesn't add much to what you could learn reading the wikipedia page on aerial refueling.Thank God the book was relatively cheap. I am giving it away to a friend because I can't stand having it on my bookshelf."
4,good quality,My son used these as cat ears for a play he was in. They looked great although he said the headband was too tight.
2,Potential to be the best,"Well this has the potential to be the best Rear Projection on the market. However, after two TV's with both having the dreaded halo prism problem all that potential doesn't mean a thing. The purplish prism is quite noticeable once you see it and from then on it serves to only annoy you as it pops up repeatedly during various scenes. When it is not noticeable the picture quality is outstanding and comparable to even LCD's. It speaks of very shoddy quality control on Samsung's part. If you order this TV all I will say is good luck and I hope you get one that is problem free! Two was enough for me and I went with the Sony 55A3000."
4,Great TV-make sure u have a big room for it!,This is a great TV but I had to send it back. I didn't know you need 4 to 5 time the length of the tv for viewing and my living room was too small and it caused major eye fatigue. It felt like it was frying my eyes so I am getting a 40 lcd and that should work better and not kill my eyes.
5,Great Amazon Service,This TV is a great TV but what I want to let people know is that the delivery service was much better than I expected. The TV was here in about 3 or 4 days. The delivery man helped me open the box and make sure the TV was operational.No tax free shipping and a better price than most.What a deal.
5,Amazing HDTV!!!,"Got this HL-T5687s today. Everything is amazing. Worked fine out of the box. Quick setup with Playstation 3 and DirecTv. Amazing picture. I cant see any bright spot in the middle like CNet claims. Although they also claim that it has PiP, and that is certainly false. I purchased the refurbished unit to save a couple hundred bucks, and it was well worth it. Eagle and Amazon don't match up at all on the tracking though. However, the TV was delivered like 5 days earlier than expected. Awesome, awesome, awesome TV!!!!!"
2,Purple Prism/Halo Issue,"Went through two of these TVs from Amazon and both have the issue with a purple halo prism on the lower center of the screen. After researching AVS forum, this is an issue with recent builds of this TV. I was unhappy with this purchase and Amazon is taking to long to recieve the old TVs to issue a refund. I changed to the Samsung FPT5084 (plasma) because of the excellent reviews."
1,This converter does not work with Panasonic Vierra TVs,"I was greatly disappointed in that the product did not work on my Panasonic Vierra HDMI port, absolutely nothing come out of the RCA output jacks. The product was touted as converting HDMI sound to RCA stereo for inputting to the AUX port on my stereo receiver. The decoder in this product does NOT deoode the HDMI port sound from my Panosonic TC P42ST30 plasma TV. Evidently this set has the latest HDMI coding and is not compatible with this product!"
3,Different,"This book has 2 sides to it. you can love the fact that you get to know more about the backstreet boys and for the fact that there are color photos inside the book for you to enjoy. However, there is the concern that the book shouldn't be written. It is dealing with people's lives and shouldn't EVER be written about. Therefore I would like to say this book was interesting I would never buy it for a bsb fan."
2,"at three years old, it still works... but not as well","I have enjoyed this camera since my MIL got it for us in 2001. But now it's starting to show it's age, and after countless uses and trip and kids we are finally needing a new one. But I like this one for ""beat up"" purposes. It still works ok. It captures the dust in the air in pictures and light reflects on it, but if you don't use the flash, all the pics are blurry. Good now inexperienced photographers, and to post online... but not to good quality for printing out pictures."
4,First Step Into Card Secrets.,"This video by Mike Joseph was the first movie which introduced me into the wonderful world of cards tricks. Before I saw it I've read plenty of books about tricks in general and especially card tricks. But when you see a trick on TV it's something incredible. If you are intrested in card tricks I would recommend you use rather videos than books. This video is very good for the first step. The only lack of it I should tell about is taht it doesn't describe every sleight in details, so it isn't tutorial itself. Anyway, it's cool video!"
1,KidSpeak Spanish,"I had bought Jump Start Spanish and loved it for my 4, 7 and 8 year old and wanted to get another more advanced Spanish software so I bought KidSpeak Spanish. I was so disappointed with it because the narator speaks castillian spanish (the way they speak spanish in Spain). No where on the box nor in the description of the software did it say it was going to be castillian. Castillian spanish is not the common spanish that is used in USA -- buyers beware!..."
2,re-write of the user manual,"While a nobel attempt to provide add't documentation resources for us SBS users, the SBS Bible book didn't go much beyond the manual and other Microsoft-centric resources. For example, some of the RAS discussion was darn near copied from Microsoft sources...and many of us know RAS is a diaster..I'm concerned the author didn't have hard won war stories to share with us readers..."
3,Decent guide for small biz network administrator.,"Provides detailed basic information for the small organization network administrator. NOT an advanced guide, with all the ""tips & tricks"", but worthwhile for end users. (My 5 books on NT Server -average 900 pages each - still don't give me all the answers either!)"
5,Go out and buy this book!,"I love this book. I bought it on a Friday evening and literally ""devoured"" it over the weekend. I just couldn't put it down. It has a little bit of everything. Many of the stories (especially the one about the washing machine) are hilarious. I often found myself laughing out loud. There are also some stories that are very moving, and I found myself thinking about them long after I put the book down. If you're looking for a great book, this is IT!"
4,Better than the Original..............,This movie is pure greatness. Every girl has massive breasts and they ain't shy about it. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't so stupid. Still you can't deny the allure of naked breasts.I give it three thumbs up (if you know what I mean)
5,Lorissa McComas Has It All,McComas is so sexy in this movie. The shots behind her as she runs through the woods in that Indian bikini are perfect. If you like a great butt & semi-thick legs you love Lorissa in this movie. The camera bounces around a bit much and is almost irritating enough to make you not want to watch. Now if you have a thing for great bods this is definitly for you. This will be one movie you will watch again and again.
4,A short but very amusing movie,"This movie was suprisingly kind of funny and had some really hot girls. It was only about an hour and 10 minutes though, and could have used much more of a story. I wouln't waste 90 bucks on it though, just watch it on statilete."
3,"Nice, but sound quality....","The boombox is fine. Looks nice. All features are good but sound quality is awful. Sometimes even at a low volume you can hear a lot of static when using the ipod. Very dissapointed with this product, I bought it 6 months ago, and I wish I can buy another one, only these time I will make a better research."
2,Fair but remote is poor,"It works, but the remote is poor, and the docking connection is so-so. The adapters for connecting various ipods aren't really suited for the ipod nano. It works, but it doesn't really support it properly."
3,it'll do...for now,"Overall, the boombox is ok. Looks nice. Very portable. Like the remote. Haven't used the CD player yet, so can't comment on that. If you have a fine-tuned ear, I suggest you look for another product. I hear a lot of static when I listen to my iPod unless I turn up the volume. I still use it almost daily, but wished I had done a little research to find something better. But given it's low price, it's handy to have to take places and not worry about it getting damaged."
1,Beware! Non existing customer service from ilive.,"I bought the player basically to listen to the radio. The sound quality for the FM radio sucks, it has lot of static in it. The static stops when you touch the antenna but comes back as soon as you leave it. I did not check out the player as soon as I got it, my warranty period with Amazon had expired. I tried to contact ilive customer service to find out if I could get a replacement but to no avail. I tried calling their customer service no. but they never pick up, left a message four times but never got a call back. Send emails but never got a reply. They have the worst customer service, it looks like the company does not exist and does not care about its customers. I would not recommend this player if you are looking for good sound quality."
1,Piece of Junk,This is a piece of junk. Sound keeps breaking when playing CDs and Ipod. This does not retain the playing position of the CD and always comes to the begining when paused or stopped. Don't waste your money on this.
2,Intermittently Pauses,"Like many others, my iLive performed flawlessly for the first 5 or 6 uses, then came the random pausing/playing. My question to everyone is this: What model of iPod are you using? Mine is a Classic (6th Gen, 2nd Rev). I'm wondering if this issue is related to a specific iPod model or if this is just really a POS device.One reviewer (Venkat) mentioned that the pausing issue occurred while in the doc *and* while plugged into the Aux port. I don't quite see how this would happen, since the iLive has no play control over any device via the Aux port (it's essentially just a pair of external speakers at this point). Anyone else experiencing this problem?"
1,Looks good but it doesn't work,"This iPod boombox is small, lightweight and looks like a great solution for broadcasting your iPod through speakers. That's where it ends. I bought this and received it the day before a big neighborhood party at my house. I tested it out the day I received it and it worked fine. When I went to use it the next day (the day of the party), the music would keep cutting out at random times and wouldn't start up again unless I pressed Stop and then Play again.How frustrating! It would only play for 10-15 minutes at a time and then cut out completely. I even tested my iPod with my computer and a small set of portable speakers to see if my iPod was the problem - it wasn't! I'm hoping it's not too late to return this item - don't waste your money!"
5,Safest way to open cans..,"The safest way to open cans ever, no sharp edges to cut your fingers with. I bought this tool for all of our sisters."
4,A surprisingly good Independant movie!,"I thought this move might just be another cheap,boring,repetitive action move with bad acting and poor action.But,although it's not brilliant,this is a pleasing film! Michael Rooker & Robert Patrick are both very good in the lead roles and Louis Mandylor shows great potential in a fine support performance.The film was made under the supervision of real SWAT teams and therefore the film's realism content is outstanding. It has very good action blending with genuine drama. I have to say,it also features the coolest and most interesting opening credits I've probably ever seen!"
5,CounterForce,"This movie covered all the aspects of a action thriller. We had a good story line, nice action shots, and of course, a heck of a finale."
3,Little Value for Money,Expensive black ink that does not last for long. Then the color cartridge mysteriously exhausted itself eventhough I hardly used it and always print in black and white. Lexmark Customer Service experience not good. Don't buy this printer if you intend to use as workhorse.
1,Ripped off dry!,"Simialr to experience of so many others, my lexmark cartridge dried up. I replaced it and the other one dried up pretty quickly as well. Trying to un-dry it by using wet cotten may work sometimes, but usually its a writeoff."
3,lexmark ink cartridges,"i have found that when my cartrige dries i use 70% isopropyl rubbing alcohol with tissue on the head and it will work again. you must do this everytime it dries out. when it it is almost out of ink i use ims ink refill system from costco only(20$) and it will work again. i usually get 3-5 refills before it completely fails. much, much cheaper. after years i still haven't used up one of the 3 black (180ml)ink bottles! it also comes with , 60ml cyan, 60ml cyan photo, 60ml magnenta, 60ml photo mag, 60ml yellow, and 20ml head cleaner. good luck."
1,will it last a normal lifespan? toss a coin,"I have used about 5 of these 12A1970 cartridges. I don't do a lot of printing, therefore the ink tends to degrade over time somehow. I have not tried the cold water method suggested by some, but I will remember it.2 or 3 of the cartridges I bought did not not even last the normal number of sheets printed before the print started getting so bad it was unusable. I think Lexmark has designed the ink to be bad, or the printheads to be unreliable, so that customers are forced to buy new cartridges regularly, even if they don't print a lot of pages.Never again will I buy a Lexmark printer. If the cartridges were $5 or $10, you could easily put up with these problems. But at $25-30, this level of performance is inexcusably bad. Boo hiss."
2,Not very comfy,These shoes just fit a bit weird and uncomfortably. They tend to pull to one side so they aren't centered properly on my foot which is annoying and I just expected better from Bloch even though they are cheap.
2,Wasn't Helpful,"We were moving to Japan and I was looking for computer software to get my kids (age 11 and 8) started with basic words. This got high marks and included other languages so I bought it. We were very disappointed and the kids gave up on it. The problem is that it is difficult to understand the pronounciation of the words. The audio is just not clear.I later ordered Power Japanese, an adult software program, and we were much happier."
5,Marriage savers is great,this book is a real help to help save any marriage I would recommend it to anyone who is married
5,The Black attacks Satan! Can a trip away help?,"During the night, at Hopefull Farms, the Black escapes from his paddock and attacks his son, Satan. Henry knows that the stallion does not like being couped up. He sends Alec and the Black to a place where they can run free. But on the way, the plane must make an emergancy landing for the Black get colic by drinking cold water. Alec must parachute out of the plane where he forgets who he is and where he is as he is taken in by a local rancher who owns some horses who is being harrassed by some rogue stallion, who turns out to be the Black. Alec, calling himself Mac, is on patrol alone with the herd aims a rifle at the Black's head. He doesn't remember that he owns that black stallion, he climbs onto his back and rides the black stallion, believing that he is a wild, rogue stallion. The ranch owner brags that his horse(the Black) can beat the another ranch owner's horse in a match race. Can the Black win the race with Alec on his back?"
4,Excellent series on modern China. Highly Recommended,"This set is comprehensive and well done. Many engaging and heartbreaking interviews with ""insiders"". I am a high school teacher and I use this in teaching my classes about 20th century china."
2,useless,"This book has a very limited number of nicknames and misses many of the obvious from the time period. Unfortunately, the author has left no way to submit other nicknames to add to her collection (with sources) which would eventually, actually make this book useful."
1,Lame,"Very banal & overdone plot. There's an evil clown and the film's black and white and there are girls with boobs who die. Everyone dies. The end. Oh, and here's a bit of text before the credits to make it seem like it's ""based"" on a true story. You know the drill."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"OK so I'm giving you a heads up. This book is the literary equivalent of watching paint dry. Wordy, dry, and sometimes ambiguous, Robb makes India's colorful heritage a monochromatic wasteland."
1,Don't buy this Product!,"I bought it for 45 USD in Turkey. After some installation, the product did not accept authantication because of ""you aproached to the limit of your installation number"". What a silly condition! If I bought it, I want to be able to install it on the same computer, whenever I want it. I dropped it to trashcan and I have downloaded ""Avast! anti virus programme home edition"" for free! Additionnally It is better than Norton."
3,HAVE USED THIS VERSION FOR 5 MONTHS I HAVE HAD MANY PROBLEMS BUT IS MUCH BETTER THAN THEIR 2006 VERSIONS,I HAVE NORTON 2005 ON TWO COMPUTERS .I HAVE HAD ERROR MESSAGES LOAD ERRORS AND SEVERAL MACHINE CRASHES BUT THE PROGRAM WORKS GREAT.I NEVER KNOW WHEN NORTON WILL ASK TO VERIFY MY SUBCRIPTION KEYS OR YOUR FREE TRIAL IS UP. I HAVE HAD TO REINSTALL 2005 3 TIMES .YOU MUST USE THEIR REMOVAL TOOL OR YOU MAY HAVE INSTALLATION PROBLEMS WITH REINSTALLATION.I TRIED THEIR 2006 VERSION BELEIVE ME WHAT A DISASTER .ODDLY THE 2005 VERSION COSTS MORE THAN THEIR NEW VERSION.USE WITH CAUTION AND PLEASE BACK-UP YOUR PROGRAMS .
5,"Easy Install, Works Perfectly","I've used Norton Antivirus for years. I tried Macafee once in college, and although it found all the viruses on my system, it was unable to clean any of them. Norton saved me.I read a lot of reviews that made me anxious about 2005's Norton Antivirus, but I haven't had any of the installation or execution problems that people complained of. In fact, it's working better for me than last year's version. Wish I could offer an explanation as to what caused problems for those that had them, but I didn't have to do anything other than follow the standard directions to get mine to work right. I just uninstalled my previous version, and installed this one."
4,I don't understand?!?!,I used to be a McAfee fan. I had their anti-virus program and then their net security suite but the spam blocker was seriously screwing over my email so I uninstalled it. Well my regular McAfee expired and I have never tried Norton so I went ahead and got Norton 2005.I have it installed on both my new laptop (dell 6000) and on my machine that I built.It installed with *zero* issues. Has never crashed and my computer is not slow or anything.My laptop has 512mb of ram and XP sp2My desktop has 1gig of ram and XP sp2I guess I should consider myself lucky that I somehow avoided the problems everyone else is having. I didn't check these reviews or I would have just stuck with McAfee to be safe.As a side note--what happened to the good ol days when virus definitions were FREE?!?!?! Even the engine upgrades were--at least for a time being. I guess it was only logical for them to end up with subscription services...oh well
4,No problem. Good enough for me.,"I was really scared when I read some reviews but I decided to buy Norton 2005 because my notebook came with Norton 2004 60 day free update.****Installation was very easy and no problem (no need to uninstall 2004).****I can not feel any negative deference between Norton 2004 and 2005 (speed, paformance etc...).So, if you bought cheep PC (Celeron 320, 1.3GHz, 512kb, 256MB),if it came with XP Service Pack 2 and Norton antivirus 2004,this is not a bad choice.I can't rate it 5 star just because I am not the expert for internet security."
1,Don't use if you ever want to play games!,"After installing NAV 5, a whole slew of games of mine would crash by locking up computer. I had to hard boot to get things back in order. I took me serveral attempts trying different graphic drivers and hardware components to track down the cause. On a hunch, I uninstalled NAV and installed avast! 5.0. Since then, my computer has been running like a champ.NAV is expensive and it just does not work right (much in the same way as their Norton Works didn't). I recommend avast! 5.0, but there are several other highly recommnened and cheaper anti-virus solutions on site like download.com and tucows.com"
1,This program may not install if you have updated XP!,"Beware! You cannot install this if you have patch KB828741 installed on your system. If your read the instructions, it tells you to uninstall the patch before installing Norton Antivirus (the install program itself does not detect the patch or uninstall it -- it simply doesn't work after you install the product) If you cannot safely uninstall KB828741 - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, it will not work. I tried uninstalling the patch using a backdoor uninstaller and had to reinstall WinXP.That said, I cannot recommend McAfee products either -- it constantly pops up adds that warn you to buy more McAfee product. It's like installing the very same SPAM-virus-spyware-popup annoyware programs you are trying to prevent in the first place! It automatically bills you for subscription-renewal without notifying you!I recommend either PC-cillin or AGV or anything else."
1,NOT WORTH IT!,"I should have read the reviews!! My computer crashed twice before I pinpointed the problem to Norton Anti-virus. I spent a lot of time repairing the computer and also lost some valuable files. Don't buy it and if you do make sure you back up your data at least once a day. I have now switched to Grisoft AVG. As others have said, it's not even worth 1 star."
1,Still buggy,"Installed it to replace NAV 2003. After installation, NAV 2005's auto-protect feature wouldn't work. So I removed it and reinstalled NAV 2003 which works perfectly well. Another Symantec upgrade dud."
1,DON'T ENTER THE NIGHTMARE,"I have used Norton for the last couple of years and have never had a problem and have liked it a lot.BUT NOT THE 2005 VERSION!It's a nightmare. It just doesn't work. There is a glitch in the virus definitions when you run live update. It just makes it worse rather than better telling you there is an error and giving you a random number but not explaining the error at all or offering any help to fix it unless you pay by the minute and call them for a huge charge. I just shelled out a lot of money for this and even though I'm not rich, I'm dumping it and looking for a better program. Norton? NEVER AGAIN BE WARNED!!!"
1,DO NOT buy Norton Antivirus!,"Norton Antivirus ruined my PC. It corrupted my registry, interfered with dial-up internet access and Quicken, caused frequent system freezes, created failed shutdowns, and interfered with clean startups. I spent 40 - 60 hours cleaning up after this fraudulent product. Symantec tech support was useless. Buy CA EZ Antivirus...it installed cleanly, works well, and my system is functioning normally again."
2,Read the Fine Print; Poor disclosure by Amazon.,"Make sure you read the fine print of this (...)offer. Amazon does not point out that this is a competitive upgrade only, and you must provide proof of owning a prior retail version of Norton, McAfee, or Zone Alarm. This should be more prominently displayed. The type on the printed form is very small and hard to read and I didn't spot this before I ordered. Like most people, my prior Norton version was OEM from Dell. Amazon does a huge disservice to it's customers by not pointing this out more clearly."
1,A Truly Terrible Product,"I bought Internet Security 2005 because Symantec charges almost as much to upgrade my 2004 version as to buy the new 2005 product. The 2005 version is a pure nightmare! I even had to reload Windows XP along with Service 2 and all of the drivers. I've been messing with this piece of garbage for several days and still get a load-stopping message, ""Setup was unable to remove previous installed versions .....etc."" I followed every instruction on the Symantec support website with no luck. They don't even have a specific solution for the message that their installer puts on your screen! This product sucks and Symantec support designers are a couple of lines of code short of a release version. I'm a programmer and would be ashamed of this program."
1,Worst Product I have encountered both for loading &support,This is the most frustrating product I have ever encountered - if you are a casual computer user (not a geek) don't even think about it. If for some reason it doesn't load right the first time - it will take hours of your time to get it off your system just to try and reload it - if it is even possible to do so.There is NO help from Symantec (unless you pay $$$) and the FAQs while detailed don't always help - in my case after hours of following the FAQ - I still can't get enough of the system off my machine to allow it to load and use the add/remove windows feature.Just save the frustration - buy another product
5,Seemless,"I started using Norton Anti-Virus a few years ago, and it has never failed me. This version is no diffrent."
4,what a difference!,"Once a year a replace this filter. Every two years I replace the charcoal filter.I have the air purifier set to high all the time all year so you may not need to replace your filters as often. It's amazing how much dirt this filter catches in one year. The old filter is noticeably heavier. The dirt is visible on the old filter, it actually looks brow in color. When you install this filter you can tell from the start that it's working. The fan actually sounds like it is running at a higher speed since it's not working so hard to pass air through all the dirt on the old filter.I highly recommend replacing this filter as often as you can afford to do it."
5,Impresionante!!!!,"This stuff is the BOMB! Dark, Gritty, Sweet, with a bite of cinnamon! We doan need no stinking Hershey's!!! Makes great hot chocolate, great mole, or just savor it by itself as actual ""Chocolate Para Mesa.""My mole recipe: 1/2 cup flour or corn starch, 1/2 cup cooking oil, 1 Ibarra disc, 1/4 cup minced garlic, 2 Tbsp onion powder, 1 Tbsp cumin powder, 2 Tbsp Chili powder, 1 Tbsp salt, 1/4 cup tequila, 1/2 cup Amontillado (or 1/3 cup merlot and 2 Tbsp brandy). Make rue out of flour and oil, add garlic and spices, stir until blended smoothly. Separately melt/dissolve disc in tequila and wine over moderate heat (do not burn!). Combine chocolate/alcohol mix with spiced rue and allow to slowly cook down to desired consistency and thickness. Serve over meat and rice."
5,This book totally makes the cool club,I love all the stuff Mary-Kate and Ashley have out.This bbok is fun-filled!It's Definitally up to style and up to date!I can't wait to read the next one.Summary is: At white oaks academy theresa new girl at school.She's popular and has the highest teck stuff!She also has a club.She trys to get Mkanda to join by doing things to get them in trouble.But now she's gone to far?*READ THIS TODAY!
5,The coolest book!!,"This book,it is totaly cool. It's exciting,funny and you can really live with them!! This is really good!!I just love it because they sometimes do dangerous things for their own sake. I just recommend this to you.You have to read it!!!"
3,Interesting??!!,"The book is a little confusing since you don't know who is narrating. It was a little bit all over the place in regards to the characters. But once you get the hang of who is narrating, the book gets a little interesting. The ending of the book is were the book gets very interesting, other than that the book is a little slow to unfold."
1,Very bad Tutorials,"While this book does a fair job of describing how to use Poser, when it comes to showing you step by step examples of how to do a particular task it becomes incredibly bad. The author completely leaves out certain crucial steps leaving you to flounder around. At times he can't even get the steps in the right order. From what I have been able to ascertain the author does not appear to have any ability to write to a beginner audience nor does it appear like he wrote this book with Poser on his computer. If you are a beginner then this book is NOT for you at all. If you know Poser 4 well then you might be able to figure out what the author is trying to tell you."
5,"Good, practical book","Consumer advocacy is critical in this day of Big Pharma and Pharma-Driven Academics, and the author is clearly a great advocate for us. I've read several dry, theory-ridden books on these subjects, but it's amazing how much more useful this book is to me. It's the difference between being treated as a patient or a person. Very readable, filled with illustrative anecdotes from chats on the author's web sites and cutting-edge science in plain, readable (but not dumbed-down!) language. Highly recommended!Lynn McAfee"
3,Kama Sutra,"This is a great and artistic installation ... illustrating, with video, what love making means ... and how to bring love making with your love ones to the next level ... it also portrayed Kama Sutra as a lesson everyone can learn ... without having to know Yoga! Understanding the needs today, and 'modernized' the style, approach, and how a couple can emulate easily, while deriving more pleasure from their most intimate moments!"
5,NICK HARVEY'S PRACTICAL RELOADING MANUAL,I actually got the content info from another site which listed among other things a list of the cartridges. Other wise I would have been very skeptical. Your costomer reviews always help. I have been reloading for over 40 years and already have learned something new from this manual.
1,"Horrible, Simply Horrible!","I loved Laura Kinsale's ""Flowers in the Storm,"" and thought I would try another of her novels. This must be one of the worst novels I have ever read. The characters are unbelievable, and the plot stinks. I read to page 214 and couldn't take it any more. I don't understand the raves by other people at all."
2,Poor Video Quality and Editing,"First let me say I left a similar review in the wrong place. I put it in the Tales from Avonlea ""Beginnings"" review section. After I realized my error, I searched for a phone number for Amazon but could not find one. I wanted to call and ask them to remove it from there.Anyway....I absolutely love the Avonlea series that Disney Channel used to have. I was very excited to learn that Disney was releasing the series in a season format.On the plus side, this Disney release does have closed captioning even though the packaging does not indicate it. Unfortunatley, the video quality is very poor and most of the episodes are edited! Also the audio was out of sync at times. (I don't know if that was just my copy).I would consider buying the seasons from Sullivan Entertainment, but they are not closed captioned which is a must have for me.If you don't mind the video quality being poor and the editing, then I think you may like the DVDs."
2,BEWARE!!!,"First of all, I love this show, grew up watching it. I jumped at the chance to purchase it. That being said, as a true fan of Avonlea, I would like to share the following information for other fans as a warning. All the episodes on this set have been edited from their original form, They have been butchered. They have annoying and quick fades to blacks, and some scenes are cut abruptly. I love Avonlea I just don't understand why we must get a trimmed down version that is not complete. If this dvd set advertises itself as ""complete"" it should be. If Disney Plans to release the other seasons, they should include full length uncut episodes the way the show deserves to be shown."
2,not worth it,"This album contains a few ballads, a few disco-songs, a few latino-alike songs.In common, this CD isn't worth it. (Although some songs are listenable.)"
2,Not including Dieter Bohlen,"It's almost worthless collection of jazzed disco tracks, few dancable latino-like songs and.... well, that's all. If you compare that to Modern Talking works, please don't. This record is very much like previous Thomas's solo albums - pretty boring and short of real hits."
3,From the author of Tales of Ancient Xenar,"This book reminds me a lot of The Nude Figure: A Visual Reference for Artists by Mark Edwards Smith. However, unlike that book, this book doesn't use any photographs and it actually has text. But like the Nude Figure, this book explains mostly how the female body responds to certain poses and how it affects the skeletal structure. Very little is offered here in the way of drawing technique. But if you're someone who prefers to buy books which contain female nude in art. you might be disappointed to find that only 2 different models are used in this book whereas the Nude Figure has around 10 times that many including male models."
2,Baby princess bath doll,Cute doll but it takes DAYS to finish draining. This make it un-useable to go from the bath to playtime.
3,Another lame-ish movie with great previews,"Well, the preview for this looked really good, so I rented it. As it would turn out this was kind of a bad movie. I figured out what was going on very early on and there really was nothing great or new about this movie. I love Hugh Jackman and Ewan Mcgregor but this is not one of their better movies for either of them. Overall: C-"
2,DECEPTION TRIES TO BE DECEPTIVE AND FAILS!,"While this film has a good cast and some interesting ideas, it failed to keep me from figuring out the obvious ending to this overly long and sometimes boring film. It's OK for a look on cable, but I wouldn't waste a dime on this mediocre effort."
3,Deception,"I don't remember ""Deception"" very well, but if Hugh Jackman is in it,it is probably a good movie. I should probably rent it again."
3,It's not like modern devotionals,It's not like modern devotionals that have a story with a spiritual lesson. Chambers just preaches at you. Most of the content is good and makes you think. It just lacks our modern presentation. The journal aspect of this edition is very nice.
2,Wagner Pontificates,"Ralph Wagner is a decent enough writer, his problem is his inability to do more than scratch the surface. If this is your first book on investing in the stock market, then I'd completely recommend it. But although I agree wholeheartedly with Warner's Growth At a Reasonable Price (GARP) strategy, this book is nothing more than a philosophical discourse. There is no attempt to give the reader any usable strategies."
5,MC BLVD IS NOT BLACK,"I ADMIRE THE YOUNG CHICANO ARTIST, MC BLVD, FOR HES TALENTED PERFORMANCES, AND ON STAGE ENERGY....HE IS A VERY POSITIVE SINGER, HE GIVES HES HEART AND LOVE TO THOSE WHO NEED TO HAVE A CHANGE IN THEIR LIFE , THROUGH JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD...AMEN"
1,A Love To Keep,"This was a well paced read with lots of smiles. Cynthia has created realistic characters who experience life and all its problems in light of their Christian values. Lori Loveland and Drew McCashlin feel an immedite spark of attraction but resolve to keep their relationship strictly business. Lori's role as nanny to Drew's two girls makes that a struggle when they're living and facing problems like a family. I was pulled right into the story, believing in the emotional and spiritual growth of these charming characters."
4,Good quality,good quality replacement belts. Best value i've seen on the net. They are as described by the manufacturer. It is unlikely that you will go wrong with this purchase.
5,Saved my Vaccum Cleaner with this belt replacement.,"The product came on time, was good and met my goal of replacing the belt which was broken and my VC was not usable for more than six months. A small expense but it saved my VC. Thanks for the easily available product at a reasonable price. Will definitely consider the Seller for future purchase and would recommend to others.Dirt Devil Style 12 Vacuum Belt"
2,No Go!,"I bought these for my DS, and I use them once in a while. They're okay in a pinch, but I must have small ear canals cause they hurt my ears."
5,Hercules The Legendary Journeys - Season 2,"Hercules spends another season fighting monsters and Gods. With Yeolis (his trusted side-kick) taking a more active role - and even having a couple of eppisode on him alone) this season is not just a continuation of season 1. Granted, there are some familiar routines, that still make me laugh, and familiar faces with cute sittuations, but there is also enough to keep it fresh!"
5,Awesome,This book is very great. I love this book it makes me want to watch a movie of it but sadly they dont. See this is how books should be then all that other stuff. But other words this book is AMAZING I can read this book in my sleep. LOVE THIS BOOK.
1,THE WORST BOOK EVER!,"I had to read this book in school. It is by far the worst book I ever read! It is so boring! Nothing happens! Cathereine goes to OT then goes to Kristi's house then she makes cards for Jason. blah blah blah etc etc ... Its so repetitive and boring. I cant belive this book has awards! If i could i would give this book ZERO stars! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!! IT IS SO BORING!!!!! If you want a good book, get the Percy Jackson series. Its really good and wont bore you to death. If you want a good book, i recomend the Percy Jackson series. Its very good and things actually happen that are exiting! I am just saying this book is very boring."
1,Not worth your money !!,"Very deceiving!! I regret of ordering this book. Although it is hardcover, but the pocket-size 4 X 6 inch book is very thin (about 80 pages). It has just one page of Cambodia history introduction and the rest are series of photos. There are no writing or description of which monuments that the photos pertaining to. They are just series of 4 X 6 inch photograph!! --- it is unbelievable how this became a book !! If you come to Cambodia yourself and take more than 80 pictures by yourself, you can do a lot better job than this book-- Trust me, you'll regret of buying this."
2,All the famous power metal cliches in just one album.,"This ambitious project by Edguy's talented singer, Tobias Sammet, just backfired, in my opinion. It has absolutely NO inovation, and, still worst than that, it seems to put the together all the available cliches of German power / melodic metal in just one CD. It's almost unbearable at certain parts. Of course all the musicians involved are very skillfull, but that did not save the album. THe term ""metal opera"" is wasted here. Trust me, it's just another power metal record: double kick drums all along, screaming vocals, hopeful lyrics, harmonic solos. It's pleasant, but, like I said before, just a copy from another copy."
2,Not Representative,"If you're a fan of Migs' stuff on NRK, you will definitely not be so interested in this collection. Completely missing are those groovy bass lines that Migs does so well and what is left are a bunch of overly glossy diva trax that are pretty lightweight even by Naked standards. Check out his ""City Sounds"" or his own tracks on ""24th Street Sounds"" to get the essence of what Miguel Migs is all about."
3,Great Info -- Bad Form,"This book provides a wonderful summary of African-American history--it's comprehensive and full of little known historical facts. I think this book provides a very good starting point for anyone that would like to learn more about African-American history. BUT, the grammar, syntax, use of cliches and lack of organization may prove distracting for many readers. I read this book after reading a book on how to improve my own writing and many of the ""writing don'ts"" in that book find a home in this book. HOWEVER, the information was worth the frustration."
5,my favorite childhood storybook,"This is the story of Peter and Davy who set out to get their mother a birthday present. Although they have very little money, they manage to collect things that they put together to make the gift. Its a sweet story and as a 4 year old I thought it was the most hilarious story ever written! The pictures portray the main action plus the antics of mischievous little brother Davy. I loved this book as a child and so did my children."
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ!!,"Kenyatta's Escape was full of action and adventure. This books really showed what a versatile writer Donald Goines was. He wrote stories that grabbed your attention whether you could relate to them or not, but they were stories with experiences that people have probably been through. With Kenyatta's Escape, it was 100% fictional, it was a different type of story, a fantasy that made you feel like you were right there in it. As a grown woman I still love to read Donald Goines over and over. This one is definitely a must read!!"
4,good text on an obscure subject,"If, for some reason, you have a nut on to learn the body of knowledge to date on ancient Chinese pictographs this is a good overview."
3,"Wrong Picture, otherwise same items included","The box is different then the one pictured ( I hate when merchants do that, feels like they sold me the wrong product).Otherwise the box says the same thing and the marbles, wooden board, booklet are all included. BTW It was super fast shipping.How times have changed. Back in the 70's and 80's the marbles I would buy were perfect (glass marbles but no imperfections on the exterior) now a days they are expensive and cheap china made junk where the outside is not a perfect circle, with a bunch of imperfections at the ends where the glass starts and stops before being rolled into a marble and sold for top $$$, I value them at a $1.00 for every 25. I do miss the old days."
4,Simply the BEST handheld fighter... EVER.,"This game is the number one reason to own a neogeo pocket. The graphics are totally astounding, and the ""card collecting"" system adds alot to the replay value. I have had this game only one day and the ""time-played"" indicator on the options screen reads 8 and a half hours. To put it this way- I bought it expecting a good game. What I recieved was the best fighting game EVER on ANY handheld console."
5,Perfect find!,"My daughter was distraught to find out that the Digimon television show was no longer airing. It broke my heart to see the tears she shed, as she loves this show. I made it my mission to locate the movie so that she could have it to watch at her leisure. Fortunately, Amazon had it! I was elated to be able to get this as a gift for my daughter for Christmas. Tears flowed when she opened the package Christmas morning. It was the first time my daughter was speechless. A great find and a perfect gift for the avid Digimon Fans!"
5,"Very, Very Good","The Digimon movie was very good and exciting despite others opinions. I liked the music especially ""one week"".The characters were very good and they were not cookie cutter like. My favorite characters were Tai,Sora,Izzy,Wilis, and all the Digimon.There were 3 movies in one movie and that was sooooooo cool.But, before the movie started there was this silly Angela Andaconda, but when it got to the first, second, and third movie it was extremely exciting. Well, that's all for now.If you havent seen the movie you will be surprised at how good it is. Bye, Raymond"
3,Will Not Play on U.S. DVD Player,"I tried playing this on our DVD player, and it's not made for this region. It kept displaying an error code to that effect. It did play on the computer's DVD drive, but it's a no-go on the TV."
2,One movie? I thought it was three,"I was in two minds as to wheather to give this movie 2 stars or 3. It is atually pretty entertaining, with some pretty good humor and good monster animation. The character animation is a bit odd- they all look a bit wobbly round the edges- that is, the character design is not a bold and clearly defined as in the series. Overall, it was visually and narritively interesting. However, as the review title may suggest, this is not one movie. Originally in Japan, 3 films were released- a short 20 minute flashback sequence and two full length features. For that reason, I'm giving this 2 stars- I hate it when the West rewrites scripts and cuts shows or movies to RIBBONS, and although I haven't seen the originals you can bet your bottom dollar there's been alot removed."
3,No Room For Games,"Well, This offers a great protections, but it only holds up to two or three games, with another game on your DS, you can put maximum 4 games in this, I kinda liked it, but I think I'll buy another one. It's NDS 15, and they have it at www.bestbuy.com or www.ebgames.com or somewhere else. I think it is like a bag and it can hold up to 9 games plus some accesories. The Case is $17.99, the normal price."
4,NDS Case,"I read all the reviews after having bought it at GameStop. I wouldn't have bought it if I'd seen the reviews on amazon.com, but I really don't have much bad to say about it. I carry my DS around with me most places and it hasn't broken or popped open, despite being dropped a couple of times. As far as the game capacity, I only play a few games at a time, then trade 'em out for new ones. Besides, let's face it, Nintendo hasn't really done much in the way of getting very many games for the DS yet..."
1,Piece of junk,"It's an okay case - it's technical hard sided to protect your fragile Nintendo DS from the bump and grind of daily life. However, it will quickly fall apart on you, namely - the carrying strap. I dumped my DS in the snow and slush when the strap on my Safe Case failed - as the clasp mechanism literally fell apart. Luckily, water and stuff didn't get in and wreck the DS - but I still nearly had a stroke, diving for it...If you need a case to protect it - it's okay, if you need something to carry it around, then it's unacceptable. Don't buy it."
3,Somewhat intriuging,"I think Bjork's personality really came through on this cd, and I like many of the tracks, but musically I think it's a bit overrated. She can really get your imagination going, especially with the tune ""There's More To Life Than This"" or the final track ""The Anchor Song"". Neither are necessarily my favorites, though. ""Human Behavior"", ""Venus As A Boy"", and ""One Day"" are my favorites."
5,Yum!,"Straddles underground dance and mainstream dance-pop. Jazzy as well. Björk's voice is, quite literally, incredible. Not for everyone, but her most accessible work. If you're looking for an introduction, this is the disc for you."
5,Bjork is still making awesome experimental music today!,"Bjork's debut album was incrediblypoppy complex yet simple to listento. I stumble upon her debutcd again 10 years later, andstill find it fresh. That'san artist for you.Serious fans should listen tothe following albums:1/ Bjork ""Best Mixes from Debut(import)""to listen to her debut albumin a fresher interpretation2/ ""Homogenic"" as she movesinto unfamiliar, excitingterritory we call experimental3/ Also, check out her workswith the IceCubes!"
5,Amazing DTS track,"Great purchase!!The DTS track is amazing, Though I didi't like the dualdisc thing (very difficult to take out of the case)every penny on this was really worth.Buy it!"
3,believes in beauty,"I am sorry to say, I am not a believer. First, I enjoy listening to a talented vocalist regardless of the context, and for this reason, this CD is interesting to me. Regretably, the music is not my cup of tea. Even though Bjork is the greatest vocalist in popular music which I have ever heard, I don't think that I will listen to this CD, again, because the music seems a bit vapid and sacchrine. Yes, I think it is good, maybe great, popular music, regretably, I just find it uninteresting. It's me. It has nothing to do with Bjork. I'm not a good enough listener for her. She deserves better, and I know she will find a better listener real soon. Sorry. We can still be friends, though. ;D If you are interested in one of the greatest vocalists currently recording, or if you are interested in accessible music with a nice beat, this CD may interest you."
4,A split decision;,"4 stars for perfectly capturing the feel and look of all those gawdawful and wonderfully bad '50s sci-fi films (Ya gotta love the rocket and mutant). Everyone did a hell of a job, right down to the smallest detail. Watch the door on the spaceship close, for example, and let's not forget the scientific/alien instruments. Also, notice what's leaning against the wall when DR. Fleming is in the cave with his ""science stuff"" on the rock.But only 3 stars for the film as a whole. As someone else noted, it seems like once the first round of ""jokes"" was out, it got harder and harder to sustain the hilarious momentum of the first 20 minutes or so. And you got the impression that a couple of the actors didn't have to try too hard to be deliberately bad. The extras are interesting and the blooper reel is funny, too. Worth seeing, and a must if you love the genuine article it parodies."
5,Sorry about the confusion,this is the greatest movie ever. it is the b movie to end all b movies. YAY
1,I would have waited longer if it was BETTER!,"Of all six releases on DVD, this one is by far the worse. The color seemes off. The bloopers are 5 minutes long and a repeat!!I enjoy the season, but I am SO disappointed by this DVD. It even seemes as if Lucy Lawless was so disinterested in the commentaries, and just wanted it to be over with. The people putting them together must have felt that way too, because this is the worst production of the entire collection!"
4,Do you like puzzle games? :) I think I'm in heaven!,"This is a really awesome puzzle game! I LOVE it! Ever play 'Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine' for the Sega Genesis or Game Gear? This plays the same way, you match the little color blobs and they disappear (not as easy as it sounds)! Way cooler though; there's this little critter that watches you play and he dances and stuff (even cuter than Pokemon's Pikachu!), and this game has plenty of that 'Japanese game feeling' that has sort of a cult following. ;) Like when you score points or cause a chain effect (complete a set of puzzle pieces causing them to disappear, making another set fall together and disappear, etc.) a little voice (the creature's?) says things in Japanese! Cute! And the computer opponents are cute and funny :) Buy this game, you'll see what I mean, it's really cool :) If you like cute stuff and/or puzzle games, this one's a real find :)"
4,A Defenite Classic!,"This game is the most addictive game i've ever played! It's a milestone in gaming history. It's better than tetris. It almost never gets old. I think that this is one of the best games period. It's just so fun. It doesn't matter if you like puzzle games, if you don't enjoy this one, you might want to quit playing video games altogether!"
4,"Great game, but...","Others have talked about the addictive qualities of this game, and I'll concur wholeheartedly; the ""just one more game"" factor is very high. But the designers made one decision that I found very problematic: they used bubble colors that are too close together. Bubble Bobble's gameplay involves making groups of matching-colored bubbles. If you're not playing in a very well-lit area, or if you have any problems with your eyesight, it can be difficult to tell for sure whether some bubbles are actually the same color; so you may find yourself making mistakes.If your vision is good and you play outdoors in the sunshine, you can't go wrong. :)"
2,100 self help books in one,"A cute collection of sound bites from 100 self help books. Repeat of some interesting concepts, not much depth or order. The few times that the author gets you interested she doesn't follow through. The end is mildly motivating. Not ready for prime time."
5,Debbie Ford is the best!,"I love all of Debbie Ford's books. She knows how to deliver her wisdom in easy to understand ways. The work we must do is deep and sometimes hard, but oh so worth it!"
2,You need first to attend therapy,"This book, has an easy reading, some really nice quotations and nice thoughts..BUT BEWARE: The excercises she gives in her book could be really helpfull if you have already attended some tyherapy and you certainly KNOW that you have fully located your neurotic points.She has excercises like ""Tell to yourself in front of the mirror 'I am stupid and useless!!', loud and a million times!""I mean, come on! You have to be carefull and evaluate before if that specific person is emotionally strong to ACCEPT that she/he is stupid or useless!It can trully help or trully damage.And, something that caught my attention, is that Debbie Ford doenst have ANY professional trainment, she calls herself a ""healer"", yeah, but sometimes attending to the university might help, u know what I mean?If she is professionally cualified, she should mention it, otherwise she could be taken as a fraud.C.A.G.Psychologist"
1,Disappointing,"The title of this book is enticing, promising a viewpoint that embraces the dark side of human nature, rather than suppressing, ignoring, or bypassing it.But that's not quite what Ford does, here.Many of the exercises are silly and vacuous (especially the one where you have your ""sacred"" self talk to your ""shadow self"" -- oh, come on!). She talks about people ""owning"" their personality traits, yet doesn't show what this really means, or how this ""ownership"" produces any changes.She cites examples of techniques and anecdotes, from her own life and from people she has encountered, but all of these stories are greatly oversimplified, and seem rather insincere.Finally, she quotes a lot of other New Age writers, especially Deepak Chopra (for whose foundation she works -- fancy that!). In fact, much of her book is really a regurgitation of things that have been written elsewhere.Anyone looking for a truly ""new"" view of human nature, as I was, should look elsewhere. You won't find it, here."
3,middle of the road not their best,the first song is great. though it lacks good production. as does the rest of the album. there are a few other good songs on here. i deffly wouldnt get this as a starting point. i recommend picking up the no future years. its all you need other then this album. then if youre still feeming for more blitz give this a go
1,oh what happened to the boys? :(,"*sniff sniff* very dissapointed with this one.This is the worst thing Blitz ever put out, cheesy 80's synth pop in the same vein as Culture Club or Modern English. I know I sound like the typical punk screaming ""it's not punk enough"" but c'mon this is BLITZ! we're talking about here , this music is just dreadful. Stick with the real Blitz material like the Voice Of A Generation release or the demo releases Warriors and All Out Attack."
4,"good performances, tight script","Michael Ontkean and Pamela Reed give compelling performances in this tightly tailored telefilm. Centering on a released rapist (Ontkean) who resides in a rural town, the script does a good job of trying to see the situation from various points of view--that of the convicted felon, the parole officer, the neighbors. The tale holds your interest and makes you think. It's not heavy on the melodrama, but instead gives the serious nature of the story room to breathe."
4,Five Mile Creek - Good as ever!,I purchased several Beta tapes of this program in the 1990's. It was an excellent family television show from the Disney Channel. The episodes were great then and they are still great today.
2,A low-end offering not representative of Sensa's actual quality,"Don't be fooled- while this pen does have the same plasmium grip that all of Sensa's offerings feature, this is not a true Sensa pen in terms of quality. If you're looking for a good pen, skip this one. Everything in this pen is plastic, and it feels absolutely cheap. I have a more expensive one, and it is amazing; I just ended up giving this away."
2,Unexpected...,"I heard that's these pens are really nice to have, so I figured that I would buy one and try it out. The pen was everything everyone said it would be... However it came with a big fold in the plastic (like it was a manufacturer defect). Other than the looks being flawed on my pen, it works good."
3,"hercules is awesome, but","I love having hercules on my computer, but now you can watch it for free if you have netflix"
3,Hercules: legendary journeys,It did very well .I always like the series very much. I used to watch it all the time. Although one of my computer is not synk with it . It did very well.
4,Worked Easily and Well Right Out Of the Package,"I'm ordering another one right now! The instructions to set the polarity and voltage were easy enough. It took all of 2 minutes to read the instructions, pick the right adapter tip, attach it with the correct polarity and the CD player worked perfectly without batteries. I have a very old cordless phone system, and one of the power adapters failed, so now I'm ordering another of these RCA universal adapters to replace it. The only reason I did not give it 5 starts was the price. It was not totally excessive, but it would have to have cost less to get that 5th star and when I say price, I mean total price, including shipping. Never the less this was the least expensive universal adapter I found. I would definitely recommend it. Make sure you read the instructions for setting the polarity correctly."
1,Where are the specifications?,What is the input voltage and the output voltage at what current rating in mA? How can you sell one of these little power supplies without this information?
4,Speed is the key...,"And yes, it is true. This game is really good overall, although nobody uses the xbox live functions anymore, which is understandable, but really hurts the game. The achievments are really hard, too. Wait, I have to do 3 things for an achievement? What the heck is going on here. The achievments hurt the game considering how hard it is to obtain them. But still, it's a pretty good game."
5,Great Table!,"My boys are two and four years old. It has really helped to turn them into little artists. We love it. It's adorable, durable and big! We highly recommend this table.Amy and Ryan"
4,A great product!,"We bought this table for my girls aged 2 and 4. We have had it for about 6 months. It has held up very well so far to various art projects and some rough play. It was easy to assemble and although parts of it are composite material instead of hardwood, it is still durable and light enough to move around. The kids can both sit and color and reach everything. It can seat four preschoolers cozily... not great for all activities but nice for a playdate snack. We haven't really used the surface as a chalkboard but stray pen an crayon marks have come off pretty easily with a wipe. Only gripe is that the benches are a bit tippy. Also the kiddies carry the crayon cups away for other games and forget to bring them back. Not a big deal but velcro attached bags (like the coloring book bag at the other end) might have been nice too."
2,Nice organization but ugly and not colorfast,I purchased this belt and tested for color fastness when it arrived against blue jeans .... left discoloration on the jeans ... this is not a pretty pink color ... the color shown on the page is actually nicer than the color of the item.
4,Book addresses hot public personnel management topics,"The editor of this textbook (and contributor) was also the individual who taught the class for which I used this book. Some topics addressed include sexual harrassment in the workplace, changes in the union climate in the public workforce, TQM, issues of diversity,and the merit system and its impact on the quality of the workforce. This is a good introductory book which gives broad, general insight into - as the book's title suggests - ""current concerns, future challenges."""
4,Good Visor,Visor was as described. Worked as great stocking stuffer. Open back band holds securely (at least on my wife's head).
4,Brighten your room too!,Wonderful colors. Not the softest of material but the colors are great. Just what I wanted for my son's room.Only regret is I didn't buy a few of the matching throw pillows.Very nice quality & perfect fit.Would purchase again and recommend to others.
3,Beware: It's not all Hunter,"This album is okay, but be warned--despite the title, Ian did not write all of this material and only handles the lead vocals on about half the tracks. The others are sung by other members of the band. Most of the songs are pretty good, but I don't buy Ian Hunter records to listen to other people sing (particularly obscure European performers I've never heard of).Of Hunter's numbers, I really like ""Dancing on the Moon"" and ""Another Fine Mess"" is fun, but ""My Revolution"" is a little hokey. All in all, the tunes are fairly enjoyable, but not among Ian's best work. Worthwhile for fans."
2,probably just a fluke,"it went up in smoke as soon as it was plugged in ,asking for eight more words ? I was a piece of junk big time"
1,Oh my..,Please for the sake of mankind.. don't contaminate the world with this garbage.. if you ever come in contact with any cd from hilary duff be sure to destroy it as soon as it comes in contact. there should really be a law against hilary duff making music. its just so wrong.
3,Fun for Kids,"When the circus comes to town, Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen, 10 year olds who believe they are detectives, help search for a missing baby elephant. Cute. Easy read. One in a series for young readers."
5,Worth the wait,"Why is nobody reviewing this cd? Vaux is a great band and this is another great addition to the vaux tradition. I like every song on this cd, there's no filler.A word of warning though...More than half of these songs would be considered ""slow"" for fans of vaux's older stuff. That doesn't mean that you won't like it if you like the old vaux though, i've been a fan of theirs for a long time, and I love this cd. It seems to grow on you, and the music is really, really good."
1,Tried 2. Both failed to function.,"The first I received, had no button to select # of cylinders, only a hole. The replacement failed to produce any rpm reading on the tach. Returned for a full refund."
3,first coloring,A good book but had for little hands to keep on the small pages with his crayons. I wish it had been larger.
1,Microphone,"Hardly picks up the sound through the MIC input port on the laptop.Tried 2 laptops, this mic simply sucks"
3,Hightower flatware,The forks are of much lighter weight than the forks I already have. They are passable for everyday use in my home.
4,"Serviceable, you get what you pay for","Though visually these forks are exactly what they appear: Solid 3-tined forks. However in your hand, they have a cheaper feel.I purchased these forks, because I thought the 3-tined forks that I used in a restaurant were cool.These forks work perfectly well, but have a harder edge in your hand, as the metal on the handle is not as rounded as more expensive forks.Additionally I think they are lighter. Also, rather than a shiny appearance I am accustomed to, these forks have more of a brushed metal appearance.All in all these are a good product, but not as high end as I expected. But then, that is my mistake as the price is appropriate. These are a great value for the price.Note: Something I had not anticipated, is that 3-tined forks since they have greater spaces than 4-tined forks, will drop through the silverware tray on your dishwasher to at least 1/3 to 1/2 length of the tine. The dishwasher manufacturers, must have designed only for 4-tined forks."
1,Included cable won't connect to current Mac minis,"I like the MiniMax because it stacks neatly under a Mac mini, and I've bought several. It includes a convenient short FireWire 400 cable to connect to the Mac mini stacked on top, which is nice, but since 2009 Mac minis now use FireWire 800, so that cable is not very useful any more. I contacted to Iomega to ask if they'd thought about providing a short FW400-to-FW800 cable instead, and the response was: ""The answer to your question is no, the MiniMax does not and will not be packaged with a 400 to 800 FireWire cable. You will need to contact Apple to obtain the cable that you are looking for. -- Hal, Iomega Technical Support""If you have an old Mac mini then this is a great drive, otherwise budget for the cost of buying your own adapter cable, or I wait until Iomega updates the product line to FireWire 800."
3,Season Five,"I never got past this season watching Xena on television. Watching it a second time, I can now see all the work spent on making the series world real. I wouldn't say it's the best Xena season, but the quality is still pretty good.There are some nice extras on this set, but it's a little annoying when they keep showing the show instead of the person they are interviewing. Ah well."
3,title of review,"Pleasant but dull. They seem to rely entirely on chorus/phaser pedals and reverb, hardly breaking new ground for blissed out sound texturing, and the compositions are melodically, harmonically and rhythmically simple and mundane. As superior alternatives I recommend the album Four Months Of Darkness by Saxon Shore, and the self-titled albums by Serene and Rarae Avis."
4,Great reflection,The Stations for Teens was a great source for the youth group and provided an excellent way to reflect on the Passion and Death of Christ. The pictures were also awesome.
2,Wife-beating = romance? PUH-LEASE!,"I got this book as part of a lot on ebay. Believe me, I wouldn't have sought out this monstrosity for itself alone.The historical accuracy and detail are great, hence the two stars for this book. Coulter really makes Viking times come alive, but if I'd read about the heroine getting socked in the jaw by the hero one more time, I was going to scream. It wasn't romantic - it was sick! Maybe women were pretty much treated close to that back then, but that doesn't make it palatable reading for today's woman. To have a romance book that fails in its most important mission - creating a story that makes the reader wish she had a love that great - is unforgiveable. Had I been Mirana, I wouldn't want Rorik anything BUT dead, and I would have made it happen, too. The fool had to sleep sometime!..."
2,Very flimsy construction.,"I ordered this magazine rack for one of our bathrooms. When it arrived, I was disappointed as 2 of the wires were badly bent. I decided not to get a replacement because the whole construction is pretty flimsy, not worth $30 on sale (maybe $10-15 max). I just don't see how you can use this shelf on a daily basis without shaking/moving the whole rack while getting your magazines out or putting them back."
1,Read this before you buy!!!!,The third edition of this book had multiple errors. I had hoped that this would not be the case with this later edition but I was wrong. There are at least 4 errors that I could pick up in the OB/GYN chapter alone. My suggestion to them....get a new editor!!!! My suggestion to you...save your money!!!
1,Not as pictured,"I just got this in the mail today. Shipping, at the very least, was very speedy. However, when I opened my package, I noticed that not only was my hula girl wearing a yellow dress, not a green one, the dress was made of string and not any straw type substance. The hula girl looks nothing at all like the picture, even the base is different. The hand positions are flat and unnatural. Overall, the hula girl I got in the mail from this company did not resemble what I was led to believe I had ordered."
1,Loser,"Loser is supposed to be a comedy, but I didn't find it very funny. The ""humor"" offered is dark and makes you want to more feel sorry for the kid than to laugh at him. This movie isn't even funny on accident. Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari may both be talented, but no one could make a good movie out of this script. If you want to watch something funny definitely buy or rent something else!"
3,Cute remake of The Apartment,"I caught this movie by accident at a neighborhood theater, and was pleasantly surprised to discover that good old Amy Heckerling had remade one of my favorites, The Apartment, with a dash of Ridgemont High added here and there. Maybe I'm biased because I know and love both of these films, but my guess is that Loser can stand on its own. Or maybe you should do a little homework and watch the original. It can only enhance the experience."
5,This Movie Rules!!!!!!!!!!!,Loser is a funky movie it's wierd cool funny and is totally awsome I think that they made the cast perfect for the movie Jason biggs is totally perfect for the part of Paul and Mina Suveraro is a good perso for Dora Anybody who liked movies like She's all that will love this
3,Catch it on cable,Not that the movie is bad or anything. It has it's funny moments. But I wouldn't spend money on buying the DVD. It's not one of those movies that you want to or need to see a few times. Once is enough.
4,a fun little movie,"I was shocked at all the bad reviews for this film...first off, Amy Heckerling is a great director and with the exception of Look Who's Talking Too, has delivered nothing but great movies. I wasn't too fond of the previews when this film first came out, and told myself that I wouldn't bother watching it, as most of America did, evident through the film's poor box-office performance...surprising that not even the star power of Jason and Mena, fresh of the success of American Pie saved this one at the box office, although I thought that Heckerling's name might make a difference....it didnt....anyway, I finally caught this at a friends house one boring afternoon and surprise surprise, I didnt just like it, I really loved it...it was an enjoyable and fun movie...its not really funny, but it is sweet, I absolutely fell in love with Jason Bigg's character....dont we wish all guys were that great??? I will definitely recommend this film, it was great..."
4,"sweet, feel good movie","I did not expect much from this movie when I started watching it but halfway through it, I just fell in love with the characters and the story. The relationship between the two main characters was really sweet and innocent but not in a mushy kind of way. Even the ""bad guys"" weren't portrayed outlandishly bad. It was such a surprisingly delightful piece of work. Something I would watch on a Sunday evening to cap the weekend off."
5,New Girl,great DVD to have if you like this show. cool extras and behind the scenes stuff. plus it's very funny and best show on Fox
5,Hilarious!!,"I love this show. It is like a cross breed between Friends and Big Bang. Always funny, always a nice pick me up moment in each episode. If you haven't watched it yet then you are missing out!Digital download lets me take it anywhere and it's great to watch on plane (although people may stare at you when you are laughing to yourself)You won't be disappointed!I buy over 400 items a year from Amazon and always give an honest review in order to help those trying to make a purchase decision.This product rates 5 stars for use-ability, construction and price."
3,Funny but very adult,This show is sure to make you laugh but it has very adult-themed subject matter. You want to make sure all of the kids are in bed before you push play on this show.
4,After a slow start it glows,"After a slow and not funny start, the series gains momentum and becomes one of the best curreNt comedies. Indeed, after changing a roommate after the initial episode, the series had an uneasy start with its humor feeling forced. What was obvious is that they were not able to capitalize frm the start on what would become the strength of the series: the irritating cute charm of the star theyy had in deschanel. Indeed the first episodes ( and I mean all of the first DVD) are unfunny and forced and make you want to cringe. However on the second DVD suddenly everything changes, basically the writing is much improved and this becomes one of the best series around overall."
5,Loretta Lynn's Review,I think that season 2 is 5 stars.Season 1 is also 5 stars.I can not wait for season 3 on dvd.Lucy you are the best.I miss you very much & can't wait for your new show.
3,No closed captioning,"I really like this show, however, with the new remastering the music is so loud that it is very hard to hear the actors. In the comments, etc., it is hard to understand what is being said when the actors have an accent. These DVD's were released after 2000 so there should have been no reason why there was no CC or subtitles. Movies and TV shows from earlier than 2000 and when CC was not common are able to have these options and with the large fan base it's a shame that these were left out. 5 stars for shows and 0 stars for no CC."
1,A poor choice for those with little statistical experience,"Please don't waste your money on this book, especially if you have little prior knowledge regarding linear regression. It is poorly written and seldom gives proper explanations for the various aspects of regression analysis. Weisberg wrote it keeping brevity in mind, so don't expect to find many details; this book is definitely not for beginners, and even people I know with more experience have noted that it is often difficult to understand."
3,Not sure about it,"This beans are ok you can tell there not your usual beans they have sorta like a spicy sweet smell to them I'm kinda disappointed with the product for them to award wining they look exactly like what u get at the store there not plump at all they look kinda of dry but this is my experience, not sure how the next batch will be for someone else with that said I would buy again to see the difference."
3,metal slug,metal slug is a real classic and is looking very good on the neo geo pocket. The graphics are nice and so is the gameplay. The replay value can use improvement by making the story more in depth. You do get to choose new characters depending on how you pass it. The game is also a little short as you can pass it in one sitting. But it is enjoyable for the time you are playing it but after you unlock the new characters there's not much left to this game. This game would also benefit from link cable compatiblity as most metal slug games are two player games. The animations and different varieties of guns and vechiles are fun but I recomend to try before you buy.
4,A Good Hard Game,I really like the arcade Game Metal Slug (1-2). But this is a little bit harder. Which is what makes a great game great. If you like war games you'll really like this one.Jump! Fire! Evade! The Only Choice in Real Game Action Is Here!
5,GREAT VALUE,"I ONLY USE B&W; PRINTING, SO I CANNOT COMMENT ON ANY COLOR INK.SO FAR, THIS IS PERFORMING AS ADVERTISED. NO COMPLAINTS.I WOULD MENTION THAT WHEN YOU INSERT IT INTO YOUR PRINTER, THE PRINTERWILL TELL YOU THAT THE CARTRIDGE IS EMPTY, AS IT DOESNT RECOGNIZE THIS ONE.HOWEVER, IGNORE IT AND CONTINUE TO PRINT.IF IT CONTINUES TO WORK AS I EXPECT, I WOULD HIGLY RECOMMEND IT AND YOU ARE GETTINGA GOOD VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY."
2,It does not work well with my Lexmark printer,"when I try to make copies, the result is very poor, it only works when I use it for printing through my computer."
3,Good If You Like Baroque Double Violin & Virtuoso,"Sadly, there are only two voice tracks on this recording: Nos. 1 & 17 (first & final). In track 1, Early Music Soprano Maria Cristina Kiehr shines (as always) in her delivery. In track 17, Baritone Victor Torrres gives a rich and melancholy performance. However, most of the other tracks are adaptations for double violin, and while not an unfavorable fact in itself, the sound nevertheless comes across as overtly loud, emphatic, and bit monotonous, especially if you listen from start to finish. The recording would have benefited greatly from alternating voice tracks with double violin tracks. Ostensibly, the goal of this recording was to headline the double violin adaptations of Buxtehude rather than deliver a balanced presentation. Organ work by Dirk Börner is noteworthy and played on a copy of a 1610 period instrument. Recorded 2002 at l'Eglise de S.Germanus de Seewen. Note: tracks nos. 5-6 are works of Dietrich Becker (1623-1679)."
2,Disappointed !!,"Very disappointed in this video. Was expecting a full 45 minute Christmas story. Instead, you get about 20 minutes featuring the Christmas story and a ""bonus"" consisting of shows the kids have already seen many times on Nick Jr."
3,"Random anecdotes, not language lessons","Don't expect this book to be understandable by fresh-off-the-boat foreigners.Don't expect that it will be a guide to Japanese culture, or a lesson in the finer points of Japanese linguistics.This *is* a book of random language-misunderstandings. It appeals to an audience of English speakers who've lived in Japan a few years, and will make them say ""Yeah, I've had that happen to me, too. Now I can laugh about it.""It's not written as well as, say, O. Henry tales or Mark Twain travelogue stories. It does, however, offer Japanese versions of each story, so it might be a nice book to give to Japanese/Western couples to read together."
5,Xena Memories,"I spent 6 years sitting on the edge of my seat biting my nails, I shared laughter, tears, heart stopping moments with my two fav Warriors Xena and Gabrielle..when the show ended so did the adventure now with the release of these dvd sets I can relive the adventures...Season 3 is packed full of great extras more interviews, pictures, special behind the scenes extras this is by far the best dvd set ever...Lucy and Renee look great..and seeing the people behind the making of the great show was a treat..all of this packed onto 8 discs and one bonus floppy..the most surprising thing about this great dvd set no matter how many extras they include the price never goes up...This is definitely a dvd set not to be missed..Thank you to everyone involved a true masterpiece!"
2,Display hard to read,One person described the Nike Imara Soar as a funky bracelet. That's because they did not realise it was a watch - the display is very dark and can only be read with ease when the backlight is activated. Even in direct sunlight the digits are not easy to read.
2,Horrible,It is soo hard to understand the theorems in this book it's ridiculous. You will only like this book if you already know the material well...e.i. it's useless for you if you want to learn something. My whole class is having trouble with this book. I'm writing this review cuz i'm so angry at this book.
1,Plain Junk,"Do yourself a favor. Do not buy this piece of JUNK!!!I had this phone for only a year and a half and the ringer just stopped working. I called GE's customer service and you know what their advice was? ""Buy a new phone sir"". Well...i surely won't be purchasing another GE phone. Steer clear of GE Phones."
4,great,very good guitar every other store i looked at for this guitar was at least $300 but this is a great deal
1,Very little replay value,"Meh.The sound is half-decent, and the setlist does provide a few nice oddities, but.... there are DK bootlegs out there that are far superior to this cash-in.Of note, many of the songs are considerably slowed-down and lacking in passion. The feeling just isn't there."
4,CEV Learning Bible is great!,"I teach 12 and 13 year-olds and have found I have less explaining of words to do with the CEV than with my previous favorite, the NIV. The side notes are useful for them and the reference to certain maps and other mini-articles is a good learning tool. The pictures are of good quality and their captions enhance the theme. However, I miss an extensive cross-reference and concordance of the NIV study Bible when I prepare for leading an adult's Bible Study. The adult participants are very impressed with the CEV and don't notice the lack of references. And, there is no need for weight-lifting after taking this Bible out."
1,Not getting what is pictured,"Very disappointed when the product arrived. The discription says styles may very, and they were right. I received product that was about half as cute as what was pictured. Compared to what they have pictured what I received is second rate. I didn't expect much for the quality item and it still was not very good. I would not recommend buying this product and would suggest looking at other options."
3,Kind of bulky,I think this would have been better if it was slimmer for little hands to hold. The flip up is really cute and the sounds are great.
2,Boring phone,"I got this for my 18 month old son because he likes toy phones and remotes. He has another sesame street remote with opening/closing eyes that he loves so I thought this would be perfect. However, this phone barely does anything and is quite boring. I decided to leave it in the package and give it away as a gift to a younger baby. When you flip it open the eyes open and it sings Elmo's World but when you press the buttons it only says the number or object that is on that key and nothing else. It is quite boring compared to all the other phone toys he has. I should have realized that there wouldn't be much to it since it was so cheap but I thought I would give it a shot since his other sesame street toys are so nice. If your little one loves Elmo maybe they would really like this but I just wasn't impressed by it at all."
1,volume too low,"I bought this toy after playing with it in the store, got it home and the volume is barely audible. I called the manufacture and they said it is for hearing protection, I said you cant hear a thing, they refunded my money but it was a total disapointment. DONT BUY TOY!"
3,Good toy for the ELMO lover!,"My Aunt got my 1 year old this phone, and he loves it. The only thing I like about the phone he hates,the sound is very low.You actually have to put your ear up to the phone to hear it,and he doesnt quite have that mastered yet. Other than that he has no complaints."
2,Can't keep it,"The volume is just too low. I understand why it's low but it may as well be mute. I have another child in the home and even when both are playing relatively quietly, the phone is impossible to hear. Neither want to play with it because of this.We're taking it back."
3,This could have been a great toy...BUT,"...the volume is too low. It's ridiculous. When we first received this as a xmas gift and we pulled out the volume tab, we thought it was just broken. So we exchanged it for another one, and of course, it was the same.My baby still likes this phone, but I know he would like it even more if he could hear the dang thing."
3,"Silence, the Elmo's World Talking Cell Phone is saying something","Low volume when Elmo is talking.Can you hear Elmo talking? I asked my son.You'll have to rotate the phone to the back were the speaker is, to hear him talking.Otherwise it is a cute phone for infants to play with."
5,My Daughter Loves Her Phone!,"We bought this for our daughter for Christmas (she was 19 months old at the time). Needless to say, she is still playing with it on a daily basis and loves it. The volume does drop when you pull the tab out, but in our case the phone is still loud enough to be clearly heard without even having to hold it up to your ear. In fact, my daughter hardly ever holds it up to her ear, she is always holding it in her hand and looking at it while she punches the buttons and listens.It provides a great amount of entertainment for the low price, and it's great to slip into the diaper bag to have handy in the car or elsewhere when I need to keep her occupied for a few minutes. The only minor drawback on ours is that it tends to go through batteries rather quickly, so I always have to find it and make sure it's turned off at night. Other than that, it's a great toy! Any Elmo fan will love it."
2,low volume,The volume on this toy once it is out of the packaging is extremely low and difficult to hear.
1,junk,"sounds wonderful in box at store but buy it, bring it home, open it for your child and watch the disapointment on their face. maybe they will get a smile out of you wondering why all of a sudden it no longer can be heard unless pressed tightly against your head. take my advice DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. rip off. wish i would have known then what i know know."
1,Toy is deceving - Volume is way too low,"THIS TOY HAD PERFECT VOLUME IN ITS BOX, AND I LOVED THE WAY IT SOUNDED.. AS SOON AS YOU TAKE IT OUT THE BOX, EVEN MY EARS COULDN'T HEAR IT... THERE SHOULD BE A VOLUME CONTROL ON IT, SO WE AS PARENTS CAN DECIDE ON WHATS LOUD OR NOT FOR OUR CHILDREN.. BUT THIS TOY IS WAY TOO LOW AND WAS A WASTE OF MONEY"
3,"Good toy but you need to ""hack"" the volume","As many others note, the phone is great but when you remove it from the packaging, the volume drops off incredibly. This is a safety feature, but my daughter doesn't play with it when she can't hear it. One can only hear it by placing it very close to ones ear as one would with a real telephone.Most of the educational value of this toy is in hearing the names of objects or numbers as their keys are pressed, something that is not possible to do when holding it to your ear.It is probably possible to trim the plastic tab and re-insert it into the toy. I just opened it up via the back screws (don't forget the ones in the battery compartment) and placed a small piece of business card between the two parts of the switch.My daughter really loves the toy now."
3,"Post is on top, not in the center","I ordered these earrings for my sister for her birthday. I had read another review that said the posts were on the top of the earring, but I double checked the images and they clearly show the posts being in the center of the stone. This is important because if the post is at the top of the stone the earrings sit too low on your ear and they look weird. Sure enough, when I asked my sister about the location of the posts (she lives in another state, so I haven't seen them personally) she said that they were on the top of the setting. Needless to say, I'm upset. Obviously, the images are supposed to be an accurate depiction of what you are buying!!! I feel deceived. That being said, she did say that stones are very clear and pretty and that she doesn't mind the posts being on top as she has long ear lobes (she could have been saying that so she didn't hurt my feelings). Anyway, be forewarned the posts are on the top of the setting, not in the center."
1,Do not waste your money,"When I purchased this book I was hoping to receive a manual discussing ""Home Automation and Wiring"" instead I received a mish mash of very low tech information. Out of 322 pages I found only 7 items that were remotely useful. The book has no cohesive flow, the author jumps from subject to subject. I would strongly recommend purchasing ""Structured Wiring and Design Manual"" by Robert N. Bucceri."
3,Not as good as what I expect,"I had bought this item for over a month. I bought a 15"" gateway notebook for my son which is .3mhz faster than this at price $700. So I basically pay extra $300 for a smaller machine so I can use it on my commute, thinking that a .3mhz difference in cpu speed should not affect too much.However, the first few days I use it, already notice it is extremely slow to shutdown or start, it took a couple minutes(that's how I feel). I also install xp on a virtual machine, that's also slow compared to my son's laptop. I almost want to return the item claiming it is faultily slow. But I kindaof lazy.Suggestion: If you have the same budget, there must be better system out there. This machine is almost slower than my compacq 680Mhz desktop bought 5 years ago!"
5,GTA Forever,The big trio that made grand theft auto one of the best videogames to grace platforms of all types. The gta trilogy includes:Gta IIIGta Vice CityGta San Andreasworth every penny! I bought the trilogy pack to use it with my ps3 and it works beautifuly. I recommend it to any true gta fan!
3,Not as pleased,"I was disappointed in this product. Although it seemed to do well and as it was advertised on one hand, the other, which had the more thinner and brittle nails is taking much longer for improvment (much longer than 2 wks)...I definitely expected more from this product than it delivered..."
5,4 Fabulous Movies at a great price,"I love all 4 movies. Had 3 in VHS format so I was able to save some space. Was delighted to see the clearer, DVD version on the screen. You really can tell the difference in clarity and color when you compare a DVD with a VHS tape."
2,It's A Good Game But...,"Well This game has some problems. First it is always freezing up after about 4 races. Second the park editor is impossible to figure out.The game and graphics are really good don't get me wrong, but the main problem is, since it's always freezing up it's frustrating to start the computer over and over again."
1,Spoiled by lack of compatibility and by DRM,"I played this game back when it was originally released and loved it. Now, unfortunately, I cannot play it because of Starforce. I get a message saying its not compatible with Windows 7. I have gone so far as to install Windows XP to VMware BUT Starforce STILL won't let me play the game.The game should include this warning.""Warning, we enjoy victimizing our customers, and spoiling our chances for repeat business; For this reason our lousy software comes with DRM.""I gave these people my hard earned money. Because they ASSUME people will steal their product, now I am being PUNISHED. I am punished by the fact that I have given them my money, and now I have nothing to show for it but a worthless piece of plastic.Thank you for reading my review! If you enjoyed it, be sure to rate it as helpful."
2,I'll be ebaying it...hopefully,"I found this at a local Circuity City. While it technically performs as described, I have found it difficult to maintain a drive mapped to it. Once a drive unmaps itself. It's very difficult to remap. (read: impossible)The performance is a bit slow, but I have never had an issue with the physical device. The issue has always been connecting to it via the special NetGear software that you need to run from your computer."
1,Stay away from this product,"I've tried for over a year on and off to get this thing to work.Every error I've gotten is mirrored by hundreds of other owners on the support forums.Someone should initiate a class action suit against Netgear for relasing this product on an unsuspecting public.It deserves 0 stars, but that option is not provided by Amazon."
1,The SD101 is good for only holding papers in place,"Purchased this with great hopes, but after loosing data (broken mirror), access requiring a Windows PC, proprietary disk format, and a software upgraded that literally Blue Screen of Deathed my computer I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.Do not buy this product!"
1,Still not compatible with Vista...works well as a doorstop,"I just picked this device up from Staples yesterday, April 30, and thought it'd work well for sharing files over my wireless network so I won't have to keep my laptop on its docking station hooked up to the external USB drives. Well, I guess I'll nver know how great this device is because it is not compatible with Vista, that OS that a large portion of new computers have installed on them. After quickly discovering I couldn't even install the software to make the device work, I went to Netgear's website and found 12 pages worth of customer complaints about Netgear's lack of customer service in dealing with customers who have purchased this Netgear doorstop. It seems a driver for Vista is coming out ""sometime in the first half of 2007"", maybe, if we're lucky. Oh, well, this is going back to Staples tomorrow for a refund."
1,This device makes me feel dirty - I wish there was a way to rate 1/2 start,"This thing is completely useless. Aside from the lack of drivers for NON Windows Machines, the lack of Vista compatible drivers, and the need to install the software on any computer that wants to access it - the thing simply doesn't work as advertised. It is slow, it floods my network with dead packets, and drops connections constantly. I simply do not trust it to hold any valuable data. I use it as a ""live backup"" only. I have a second machine for the real backups."
1,This is the worst,"If you follow the prompts in the setup and update the software it will no longer function.Their technical support is totally incompetent and their ""2nd level"" of technical support is almost impossible to reach.Another total waste of time and money!After this bad experience (my second) with Netgear I will NEVER ever purchase a Netgear product again!"
1,Bad experience! Many Problems and now no Vista support,"I bought this device as a NAS in my network. The setup is pretty easy. Than you find out that you have a proprietary solution. It runs only with computers that have the driver installed. I would expect that you get this information before you buy. Than after installation I experienced several (allmost every day) break downs of the system. Drives where not accessible and I had to reboot. Those problems finally seemed to be solved with a new driver. Meanwhile a upgraded my laptop to Vista home premium. Guess what - the new driver. as the old one, doesn't support Vista. So, no access to my data on the SC101. I bought a Buffalo NAS and now I'm satisfied. It was a waste of money to buy the Netgear device."
1,Just Needed a NAS device,All I wanted was a NAS enclosure this was not it. This junk makes you install a client on each computer that you want to use it with. SUCKS
2,Not happy with it...,"It's difficult to find anything positive about this product. Read/write speed is low, drivers seem buggy (my computer is crashing from time to time since I installed the software) and I'm having problems when two or more computers have to share the same folders."
1,This device doesn't work with everything!,What operating systems cannot be used?Macintosh OS X or OS 9UNIX64-bit operating systems(from the Netgear support website.)
3,"As a die hard RBF fan, I can say this isn't one of their better projects.","Not many words that can describe music. All I can say to this is, it's not up to RBF's game. The songs aren't rhytmic and the lyrics seem rebelling as usual, but the music doesn't drive with it. It's good though. Just not as good as I hoped it to be."
4,A pretty good CD that's worth a listen,"I first heard of this band through my friend, who's into ska and punk. Hey, I am too! He described them to me and then he let me borrow the CD. Pretty good! If you like Less than Jake, you'll like Reel Big Fish. Be warned, this CD isn't a good as their follow up, Why do they Rock so hard. Also, if the thought of a somewhat repetitive horns section turns you off, you won't enjoy this CD to it's full potential."
4,fish for me!!!,"this is an amazing super ska album featuring the absolutely amazing and ska like horn section!! the best song on here is sell out-- it never gets old and everything sucks is good too. this cd is great for blasting in the car or anywhere for that matter and it is one of the best ska albums out there. however, she's got a girlfriend now, was good the first 3 times but it gets so annoying so fast...but in order to really feel the wrath of reel big fish, you MUST see them live because as with all (or most) ska bands, concerts are what makes ska awesome and in-your-face!!"
3,"i think that the sound clips were short, need to be longer",i think that even though the bands saongs were good i still could not get the total impression like how the song begins or ends. i think that the sound clip sould be of the whole song or moer of the song.
1,Reel Big Sellouts,"Sure when you listen to a couple of their songs, they have an okay sound, but all of their songs sound the same, even on other albums. And am I the only person who isn't completely dense? Can't you hear what they're singing about??? Sellout... well they have. Trendy... They want to be. All I want is more... and Join the club...!!! Come on!!! Hey everybody jump on the corporate bandwagon! Join the club! Listen to Reel Big Fish!!! And don't even get me started on their newly lost Ska influences. This band is starting to sound more like Blink 182 and other manufactured pop-punk crap every day. (Come on...Where have you been...)Your time is better spent listening to Less than Jake, Streetlight Manifesto or Catch 22(I'm assuming you like Ska). So don't waste your money!Well all I can say is, if you LIKE listening to music that sounds like everything else and is completely hackneyed and unorigional...then this is the album for you!"
1,no melt yet,I thought these would help melt the ice buildup on my roof. I got out a ladder and put a few up on the ice on the roof. After almost three days now there has been no melting.
1,Thin and poor in spectroscopic work book.,I'm new into this field and I found this book too thin without enough general knowledge introduction to the subject. I didn't find enough spectroscopic work results in this book. Not recommended.
2,Plot is OK but author is not. Interesting female character,"I think the plot of this crime mystery was ok. It's not stupid. But I think the author lacks writing skills, at least then his writing failed to engage me. The most interesting thing about this novel is the female character Thalia Drummond, she is actually very modern and seems to me like a prerunner to some of the female heroins we have come to know later, for example Lisbeth Salander. As far as I know this novel is written in the 20's. But the general feel of the novel is much earlier, I would have thought the 1880's. I don't know why, but the plot of this novel makes me think about modern art... So if you are an artist into modern art, you might actually be able to conjure something interesting up, by integrating the plot. Hm... I really don't know why I said this? Strange review, huh?"
5,Just Like It Looks,"Handsome ornament. Well packaged. Just what I was looking for. A treat for ""My Marine."""
4,Very Durable,I bought this toy for my 4 year old brother! Its a great plastic that is really durable! It is hard plastic but pliable. I can't wait for him to get it on Christmas!!! My brother is autistic so I was glad to see the quality of this so I know it will hold up to the test of this 4 year old!!
3,much smaller than I expected,"This little octopus is cool. but much smaller than I expected, even though I knew the dimensions. The 7.5 inch dimension is from the very tips of the tentacles, not the diameter of the body. It is a rubbery, flexible plastic. The quality is very good overall."
4,An adequate product for the price.,"I found this product to be along the lines of what I was looking for. The film captured my kids attention and held it very well. I was surprised to find that the film contained other machines besides rockets like heavy machinery and submarines. So if the child you are buying this for is somewhat interested in rockets, I recommend it. My only caution is that it may seem a bit 'cheesy' and dated."
4,"Great Fun, Poor Handle Bars","My 20m old son is a stunt man by nature and upon receiving this bike for his first birthday he was instantly compelled to stand on the seat with both feet! He loves this bike but the problem is after only 3 months one of the handle bars broke off due to all of his stunts. Aside from that he thought it was great fun to switch on the ""motor"" (confetti) and take off all over the house. Also wonderful that there's only one wheel in the back so as not to catch his shoes or feet on the wheel wells. Probably a great bike for the average child!"
2,Is my son just unbelievably short or what?!!,"OK, we got this for our son when he was 18 months old and it was way too high for him to ride (even on the lowest setting). He's now 2 and his feet still aren't reaching the floor. How annoying. And friends of mine have this and have the same problem. So, it just sits there most of the time."
2,DO NOT PURCHASE,"My daughter is 18 months and wanted to be like her big brother and have a trike, but she couldn't reach the pedals. We thought this would be a wonderful alternative. She hates it!!! It is hard to make it go anywhere, and she gets frustrated and gets off within a couple of minutes. Hoping to find a trike that has pedals and where she can reach them."
1,Handle bars break off,I have had two of these because I thought they were so cute. The handle bars broke off of the first one after about a year. I thought it was defective or maybe my daughter put too much weight on it. I bought another one and the same thing happened right away. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this product.
4,Watch out there they go,"I purchased this rider for my nephew for Christmas 2003, at which time he was 18 months old. I recently visited him and at 20 months he knows how to turn on the little glitter dome by himself which makes his eyes sparkle. I really like that he can enjoy riding this in the privacy of his home. I observed kids around his age when I was thinking of purchasing his first ride on toy. I was originally thinking of buying him a tricycle. It seems at this age they are not coordinated enough to ride a toy with pedals. I am pleased with my purchase and look forward to him enjoying it for many days to come."
2,Not very sturdy,"We bought this for our 14 mo. old for Christmas 2003. He is a very active little boy, and it took only a couple of months for him to break the handle bars off. Remember - this is an average sized 16 mo. old boy, not a sumo wrestler. I wouldn't recommend this toy to anyone. It was a waste of our money."
4,Older model much sturdier,"I had the older model with two wheels in the back that I bought used at a garage sale. After five years, the handle bars finally broke off at the hands of my five year old. My two year old also loved it and never had problems getting her feet cut. (I try not to let my children ride without shoes, so I don't know if they would have cut their feet.) I would love to replace it, but after these reviews I think I'll look for something else. My thanks to everyone."
1,DON'T BOTHER!,WE BOUGHT THIS FOR OUR 18 MONTH OLD GRANDCHILD AND SHE HAS NOT ENJOYED IT AT ALL. THE CUTEST THING ABOUT IS THE WHIRLY THINGS IN THE DOME BUT IT IS HARD TO MANUEVER SO SHE BASICALLY JUST LEAVES IT ALONE. WASTED MONEY! WISH WE HAD GOTTEN HER SOMETHING ELSE!
1,A surprising disappointment,"We purchased this for our daughter when she was about 18 mos old. Though excited at first, she quickly became frustrated as it was hard to steer and tipped over easily. The spinning thing in the center would quit working with new batteries (changing them can be a hassle because of the design) and the only way we could get it going again was to shake the bike. It wasn't long until she just quit playing with altogether and we eventually gave it away. For a toy by Little Tykes this was a disappointment as we've never had a problem with any of the other toys we've gotten from this brand. The only reason it gets 2 stars for durability is because the handles never popped off on ours as it has done with other reviewers. QA must've been on vacation when this was rolled out."
2,"Lots of fun, handle broke and cannot be repaired","My son is in love with this bike. He wants to take it everywhere he goes. I like that it is made of plastic because it does not damage things around the house. But after less than a year, the handle broke off and nothing (glue and other) could repair it. I also agree about the heels getting caught under a sharp edge. Also not stable if the child is backing up."
1,Doesn't worth the money,"The book as no CD or a pointer to a web location where you can download the images to practice. There is no point to explain the techniques if you don't have the images.There are a lot of other books on Photoshop, that are no so beatifull illustrated, but that you can learn a lot more by following the step by step instructions."
1,DISAPPOINTING!,"I really enjoyed the first book, but I found this one, Brotherhood of the Wolf, terribly difficult to get through because it was so boring, and repetetive. What was a great concept in the first books, is just a tired, worn out concept in the 2nd book. It dwelt too much on the endowments... Mr. Farland needs to bring in new ideas."
2,"Didn't enjoy it, couldn't finish it","I tried, but didn't make it past page 100. Same old stuff, a generic fantasy novel full of all the usual cookie-cutter castles, villains & heroes. If you liked the first one you get the same thing with the second."
2,CONCEPT TOO DISTURBING,"I was put off by the concept of Nobles taking enhancements from other people, leaving them living vegtables. And the Reavers, insect like things that surge from the bowls of the Earth- Yech- too scary. Not an alternative world I enjoyed visiting."
4,Great addition to the series,"This book continues the Runelords series and compared to the first one there is more action and magnificient battle scenes. Once I picked up this book, I could not put it down. My only complaint is that certain parts are a little too redundant, repeating parts that we read earlier in the book or even encountered in the first of the series. This may be the author's way of keeping us abreast of the situation but at times it can be annoying to read something that I already know.All in all, a valiant effort.On to the 3rd of the series..."
4,Great supporting cast,"I really enjoyed this book. I thought the magic system andit's ethical questions were interesting. I somewhat agree with the reviewer that felt the women were stereotypical, but Myrrima turned out to be one of my favorite characters in a long time. My only problem with the book was Gaborn, who I just could not bring myself to care about. It seems as though much more effort was put into the creation of the supporting cast, whom I found fascinating and unconventional, with several twists on standard characterizations."
3,XBOX 360 20GB HARD DRIVE REVIEW,"I like the product, but it only came with 13 gigs of free space on it. Nowhere in the description did it say that it only had 13 gigs of available space on it. Therefor, its not a 20 gig hard drive."
3,not compatible with slim,"I am sure this a great product for older models of xbox 360, but in the description it doesn't say what model of system it works on other than a model number. It probably works on all older systems, but I had no way of knowing it wouldn't work on the 360 slim."
4,Fits the bill but fills quickly,"A hard drive for the 360 is a necessity. Sure you can get by with multiple game save cards at 64MB or the new larger ones. But that gets cumbersome and expensive. If you use Xbox Live, you need local storage for demos, movies, game saves, and so on.The 20GB is OK as it fits the bill and allows local storage. But if you are serious about gaming and hording downloaded content you will definitely want to look into the larger sized hard drive for the 360."
2,Rip Off From Microsoft,"Having a hard drive on your xbox 360 is very convenient to save your gamer profiles, music, games, etc. However, this hard drive is advertised at 20 GB when in reality it is 13.7 GB. It is not uncommon for a drive to be falsely advertised by a a small amount of space. However 2/3 of what of what is advertised is unacceptable. It would be the equivalent of getting a 640 GB hard drive when it was advertised as being 1tb. Also this is a huge rip off considering you could buy a 250 GB external hard drive for the same price. In my opinion you would be better off buying a 16 GB flash drive for under $20 because there is more storage, it is half the cost, and its portable so you can put your gamer profile on it and game at your friends house using your profile."
5,Excellent Historical Review of End-Times Movements,"This book is a very important read for those who may be tempted to believe many of the highly speculative views which are passing today for legitimate biblical scholarship. It shows how many people throughout history have followed both Christian, and non-Christian movements that were tragically flawed in their thinking regarding the end of the world. Overall, the book offers an excellent survey on the history of end-times movements. In addition, you will also find the book provides a thorough bibliography which is useful for further research on the topic."
2,Watch out! DVD has errors!,"Truly classic 1950's science fiction, but this double-sided DVD is defective. Only one side plays through correctly.The TCM Classics version is probably a better bet; 4 movies, including ""Them!"" and ""Beast From 20,000 Fathoms,"" for just a little more $.2 stars anyway, because I think ""Them!"" is a great flick -a definite precursor to ""Aliens."""
2,Only one movie plays,"I purchased this double-sided DVD and it arrived just fine. ""Them"" played just fine. Unfortunately, when I turned it over and tried to play ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"", it would not play. I assumed that there was something wrong with that particular DVD. So I returned it. Amazon was great about the return and sent me another DVD. Unfortuntely that one too would only work on one side. So I can only assume that there is an innate flaw in the pressing of the DVD. Since one side works I won't pursue it any further but be aware that this problem exists before you buy it."
1,only one side,"i got these videos because i love the monster flicks, but only one side of the disc works. couldnt watch the beast from 20000... very sad..."
2,note this is a review of this book with Jurgen Miller as Ed,This huge colour encyclopedia is a look at some of the more popular movies of the 80's. Note it is not a comprehensive listing and a substantial number of great movies are not contained within. This book seems to concentrate on movies which have won Oscars as each has an Oscar rating. It's a good book for the movies contained within but for a book of its huge size a lot more could have been included. I would recommend Film Posters of the 80's - the Essential Movies of the Decade instead of this book.
2,This thing is ssssslllllooooooow,"I am not a happy camper. Half the software I want won't run on this thing, and the rest runs like cold ketchup: slow, slow, slow! Skip, don't pass go, and don't waste your money. Think you better buy something different."
3,Is it the best?,"Since I am new to wedding photography, I was looking for a how to, trick of the trades, how to enhance my shooting skill kind of book. I did not find much of info in this book that I need. There are many very nice photographs in the book but little of explanation on how the the photographs were taken, etc.I guess I need to look for another wedding photography book."
5,A great gift.,"I gave these to my mother as a mother's day gift, and she loved them. They're really pretty and the color is subtle and elegant, suitable to my 63-year-old mom. I'm happy with the purchase."
3,Ok but expected a bit more,"I purchased these as a gift for my boyfriends mom. I am really disappointed in the packaging. They came in a small box with some filler and the earrings themselves are in a very cheap little bag. I was expecting something I could just wrap up. Now I need to search out something to make it a presentable gift. The earrings themselves are nice enough, seem a little on the cheap side for the posts. I guess you get what you pay for, $40 worth anyway. The color of the stones is very nice. I wouldn't recommend this item to a friend. I am keeping them because they do match a necklace I got her for Christmas last year."
3,Okay,"The earrings are as pictured. However, the size is 7 x 5mm which are small. The picture gives you an impression that the earrings are larger and flat.Not what I thought I was ordering. The setting is nice."
4,Couldn't put it down,"Great book. A little hard in the beginning since it jumps back and forth, but starts to make sense as you get deeper. Non law enforcement people might have a slight problem understanding some of the lingo. Overall a great book."
1,Such a light blue that it's colorless,"After reading the reviews on this item which stated that the stone color ranged from a nice blue to colorless. I decided that for the low price tag ($20) it was worth the risk of getting colorless stones. Unfortunately, luck was not on my side and my stones were colorless. The earrings are still nice, but I would have preferred them to be at least somewhat blue."
5,Great Movie! Where's the DVD?,"I saw this movie years ago, and would definitely buy it for my home collection... if I could only find it in DVD format."
2,vampire`s kiss sucks,I turned it off after 38 minutes. Too slow and boring. I had to watch with subtitles because much of the dialogue was low and hard to understand.
2,Schank meets Dickens,"This is a wonderful failure of a book. It is a heroic and searing assault on our decrepit educational system that we should all heed. However, the Dickensonian language and plot don't quite work. Schank is a fine writer (see his ""Coloring Outside the Lines"") but he is no novelist. The book is crammed with interesting stories and facts about the evolution of the modern curriculum which alone is worth the read. Schank's vision of education without standardized tests is a welcomed alternative to today's depraved political debate on educational standards. Recommend for educators and parents."
5,"Fun, quick read, butterflies included!","Hey, if you're looking for rocket science between the covers of a romance novel, um... might want to look elsewhere! :) While this story isn't a Tom Clancy novel, it is a fun read, and on the ""Butterflies-in-the-tummy Meter,"" it rated a good solid three butterflies (on the standard of four!). Heck, the cover alone would have sold me the book. Take one hunky guy, muscles PLUS... tell me he's in the military, get him half dressed... sheesh! Then the contrast there with the baby... awww! But cover photo aside, this was a very cute story with a satisfying ending. Good job, Ms. Child! Exactly what I've come to expect from your writing."
5,I am really into Prophecy,This Prophecy study Bible really helps me study about the coming of Jesus. Only God the Father knows when Jesus is coming for the church.
2,"so, so","The printed index on the outside of the tube is so faint, that it will probably wear off in a month, making the tool useless. Other than that, very nice."
3,Slow and mediocre but recorded well,"I have heard a lot of praise for Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy. I heard that this was one of his finest albums. It was recorded and arranged amazingly well, but it drags. Not so much that's slow, it's supposed to be that, it's just that nothing especially jumps out and says, ""I'm a great song.""The female singer that backs him is inconsistent. Sometimes she sounds like an angel sometimes so grating and you'll wish she wasn't there. She sounds like a classically trained singer that has no idea what to do with music from the heart. I can hear the yearning to make heart felt music, but it just doesn't quite hit the mark.I imagine him thinking, ""Man, I wrote this awesome song, but I'm really tired and worn out. I can barely keep my eyes open. Let's record it anyway.""The album doesn't suck, it's just nothing special."
3,Not the Masterpiece It So Wants to Be,"All the stars seem to perfectly align on ""Cursed Sleep"" and unfortunately nothing else on The Letting Go comes close to matching the lush, epic, crescendo arrangement and complementary, ""just so"" harmony of Dawn McCarthy on that single. The song is flawlessly mixed and balanced; in most of the other tracks, McCarthy is more pronounced and the result is more of a distraction, akin to dumping a boulder, from space, in a glassy, rural lake: it breaks you out of your spell. Overall, producer Valgeir Sigurosson did an impressive job to combine the rustic with symphonic, but perhaps Bonnie `Prince' Billie might want to consider the more consistent, and ethereal, Nigel Godrich (Blur, Beck, Elbow) for his next album."
2,"Underpowered, over-rated","I bought this while trying to ""switch"" from my Dell laptop. I was woefully disappointed. The machine is painfully slow...slow...slow. Moreover, the construction is rather flimsy. I'm hoping the Powerbook will be a better fit. On the other hand, it is super-light, but at tremendous cost!"
5,Best poker game out there,"There are a lot of really bad texas hold 'em games out there (I've played a bunch of 'em), and this one seems to go against and the trend and actually is very well done.It follows the Poker Superstars TV show. You get to play against some well known poker players - like Doyle Brunson. It looks pretty nice and follows the show's graphics, music too. I really liked the crowd aplauding my good hands.The AI is pretty good, much better than average, and a lot better than some of the really bad ones I've played against. It definitely took me a while to win a couple of rounds, and still working on winning the tournament.All in all, a pretty great game, glad to finally have a poker game that I like to play - perfect for laptop play on my business trips."
2,Good Bio,"Orgiinally bought this because of the claim it teaches tricks, however the tricks are outdated and mostly bar room oriented. It's plus side is it reveals alot about the magician Alan Wakeling's life and magic inspiration."
5,The Best Summer Movie....and Beyond!,"I have to admit...I'm anticipating that Return of the King will be the best movie of the year....BUT Pirates just rocked my world all summer long! I've seen it...ok, 12 times...because I know that even when it's on DVD, it won't look or feel or sound the same as when it's still in the theaters. I won't say much more because 5 Stars says it all. Just a word of advice for anyone who hasn't seen it...leave your logic at the door and enjoy this film! I am so tired of seeing car chases and trucks blowing up on LA freeways (T3, S.W.A.T., Matrix Reloaded and even The Italian Job). I want more period films if they are as well done as Pirates was!"
5,Swashbuckling good time!,"What fun and delight was the new movie ""Pirates of the Carribean""! Many of the familiar scenes in the ride are played out in the movie which is so fun to see, and it gives the movie a real Disney 1950-1960's feel to it.Johnny Depp looks like everything a suave, swashbuckling, dark, handsome pirate should be. How refreshing it is to see him use his rare comedic talent and he does it in a perfectly amusing waySword fights, double crossing, walking the plank and lots of cannons! Even the movie theatre was dank and moist much like the ride, and I wondered how they sell tickets on a hot sunny day.Just like the ride, I loved the skeletons in the movie. I was so happy to see them come to life and live and fight in all my beloved scenes.The only two draw backs; the movie was about 15 minutes too long, and there was no blue bayou lagoon."
5,"Give me popcorn, get out from in front of the TV.",I am such a big fan. This is one of my all time favorites( Next to CASABLANCA on HD). The next 2 movies didn't do much for me. But the original curse of the black pearl on BLU-RAY. It don't get better than this.
5,Caribbeanicious!,"Every decade, movie producers come out with a newer version of every genre to suit the evolving audience. Unfortunately, there has never been a REALLY GOOD pirate movie until now. Pirates of the Caribbean is one of the best Pirate movies you will see probably for the next two decades. It's got everything, the old movies of the the 50's and 60's has, (love story, suspense , not-so-smart pirates) combined with todays humor and actors. It's no wonder this 'neo-classic' has done so well in the box office."
3,WHAT WAS ALL THE HYPE ABOUT???,"When this movie came out I was not to interested in it. Not thatI am not a fan of this type of movie or of Johnny Deep He has become a really good leading man and does not try to fit into a Hollywood mold, He is willing to take a chance and for that I do respect him. My favorite movie with him in it is DONNIE BRISCO I think that was what it was called. Anyway getting to this movieI had heard that this was a great movie and so I rented it. Well, tell me was he DRUNK in this movie or playing a GAY Pirate I can't tell??? Whatever the case, I am glad I rented this movie instead of going to see it. The best thing about it was the special effects and that is about IT. For that alone I give it 3 STARS."
4,good stuff from disney? oxymoron? not this time.,"a movie based on a tired disneyworld ride? please.i starting watching this dvd with quiet indignation. i like quirky, arty FILMS. this was a popcorn flick of the first order.but i had forgotten about johnny depp. you must have faith in depp. this guy MAKES every movie that he's in. name a bad johnny depp movie...quick...can't do it, can you. well, if you think long enough you can, but he's good enough to add at least some interest to anything he's in. so there we go, a quirky movie it is.you forget it has anything to do with the Evil Empire (disney, that is) when depp is on screen with his keith richards slurring, eye makeup and gold teeth. i read somewhere that depp's daughter thinks her dad's a real pirate. hell, so do i.so if you're against summer blockbusters on principle, like i am, bend the rule a bit and see this one. it's pretty good."
5,my favorite all-time movie,"This is the greatest movie to hit theaters yet. The characters in this movie are amazing! My favorite part of the movie was when Will Turner and Jack Sparrow sword fight in the blacksmith shop and when Will imitated what Jack does. In the movie theaters I was so, so scared when Elizabeth backed out of the room where Babossa and her were dining when you saw the skeletons for the first time. Once the movie was over I couldn't wait until it came out on DVD!!! Once my dad got it for his birthday I at least watched it 20 times in the first week. My brother and I now even know how to sword fight a little. Anybody who is 12 and over should deffidently watch this movie!!!!"
1,"From a swashbucking fan - this one is dumb, dumb, dumb","I enjoy pirate flicks/books, and most any swashbukler, but I do not agree with the majority here at all. Johnney Depp was milding amusing, but the living dead pirate crew were just too dumb. I almost fell asleep a couple of times, and couldn't wait for it to end."
3,Was that Johnny Depp or Keith Richards,"Depp must have used Keith Richards as his role model for his character. Depp looks like walking death through most of the movie, he tries to act like a 'wise old' english puff with rough edges.While the movie is part Pirate Story and Fantasy, the effort by Depp while interesting isn't what it should have been for a character seen by millions over the years at Disney.Depp was hardly the 'Pirate"" I envisoned all those years ago when the water sprayed my young face as I rode the ride ""Pirates of the Caribbean"".Interesting but also disappointing."
5,Excellent movie,"Johnny Depp brings another quirky character to life. In contrast to reviews I read other places, I believe the rest of the movie stands well by itself (however the performance of Johnny Depp definitely makes it a 5 star instead of a 3)"
3,The Curse of Too Much of a Good Thing,"Although Johnny Dep can be hilarious, he falls a bit short as Captain Jack Sparrow. He is funny, just relies on the same slap-stick over & over. I like a good slap-stick, but I'm frustrated because I know Johny Dep has so much more...depth in his comedy acting.As for special effects; this movie's sure got 'em! Too many of them & they're too similar. Is he batttling the Flying Dutchman or the royal Navy? Except for the wigs & tentacles, who could tell?This show was very entertaining & I enjoyed it. It's appropriate for Tweens & teens, some language, no nudity, lots of violence full of action, &, oh yeah, some comedy thrown in!A good, light summer movie."
5,2 words: Johnny Depp,"This movie is by far the best I have ever seen. Not only are the graphics fantastic, but Johnny Depp brings to life a brilliant character that should no doubt be the one he's known for. With a wonderful mix of humor, romance, and action, this movie is sure to keep you on the edge of your seats. The music and scenes were just made for each other. In my opinion, the movie was not long enough."
5,Pirate Attack for Top DVD,"Since this movie hit theaters in July it is a absolute loved action/adventure movie. With the stars Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom this movie has hit the top in all dvds and movies. I agree that this movie should make it to movie of the year. Even if you are afraid of pirates, dark moments, and scary scenes. You should still at least try to see this movie. It will absolutly give you a pirates life. A total 4 star."
5,Splendid,"Honestly, could not be better. Great film. GREAT actors, especially Johnny Depp, who's very entertaining and comedic. The script is wonderful, and adlibs make it all the better. Good story. Keira Knightley, although deprived of swordwork, is astonishing. Not a deep story, but entertaining. Besides humor, there is suspense and action and romance. Worth seeing again and again. Great features that are worth buying the DVD for. Chemistry is great between the actors. A great, fun, humorous film!"
3,You might watch this twice...,"If you buy DVD's instead of renting...rent this first then decide. I am a Depp fan and he IS great and the co-starz are wonderfull in this one but the plot is a bit of fluff and won't stand the test of time. It's not a ""classic""."
3,WDWCP alumni will enjoy scenes recreating the POTC ride.,In 30 words or less...Great movie for the whole family. Length is too long. Depp's approach to pirating is refreshing/funny. Walt Disney World College Program alumni will enjoy scenes recreating the POTC ride.
5,The Best Movie!!!,"I loved this movie! It has everything! It is exciting, funny, suspenseful, and terribly romantic. This movie seriously kept me giggling and sighing for days! It is one of the best movie I have ever seen!"
3,Action? Adventure? or Comedy?,"Johnny Depp provided a great performance that often provided comic relief. But after having seen ""Master and Commander; The Far Side of the World"" before and ""The Return of the King"" after, we were confused about under which heading we might find ""Pirates""..."
3,Johnny Depp doesn't make up for a movie that's too long,"Not a bad film, but a rewrite that cut out 50 minutes or so would have made this a 5-star movie. Instead, it was oddly redundant in its machinations (how many times are we going to revisit the pirates' cave?) and overdeveloped in its characterizations (Jack and Elizabeth are stranded on the desert island for nearly 20 minutes). Shorter would have been *much* better."
4,Pirate entertainment for a new generation,"When I was a kid, we had the daring, charming, gymnastic duo of Burt Lancaster and Nick Cravat in The Crimson Pirate. Today's generation can fully enjoy Pirates of the Caribbean and the off-balanced fun provided by Masters Depp, Rush and Bloom.This movie is exciting, entertaining, campy fun for all ages, a new high water mark for a genre as old as the movies themselves!"
5,Best Summer Movie!!!,"This was a great movie! I'd been waiting months to see PoTC and when it came out I was not dissapointed! Johnny Depp was amazing. He IS Captain Jack Sparrow! Love the pirate makeup! Of course Orlando Bloom was just as awesome as Will. And he's hot! The special effects are great, especailly when the pirates turn from human into skeleton, and vice versa. The movie has many memorable lines that I'll probably be quoting for the next 6 months, along with singing the yo-ho song. Another great thing about Pirates is that it kept true to the ride, from the prisoners trying call the dog holding the keys to the man sleeping with the pigs to the different lines every now and then, such as captain Barbossa yelling ""Ya bloomin' cockroach!"" I definitely give this movie 5 stars and reccomend it to anyone who's prepared to be ""Blown out of the water."""
5,Not a Tipical Disney Movie,"Whoa. This is one really good movie. Based on the Disneyland ride, Pirates of the Carribean delivers. This isn't a nice kid's movie. It's pretty intense - not really normal Disney.Johnny Depp makes the movie. He plays Jack Sparrow, a strange pirate who is hillarious. He makes the movie funny, while the rest of the action has you wanting more. This movie also has Orlando Bloom, for all you Orlando Bloom fans.The plot is well written. The special effects are spectacular. It looks scary real when the cursed pirates turn into the living dead. Great movie, so buy it."
5,Best Pirate Movie EVER!,"I went to see this movie yesterday, n i was blown away! Johnny Depp is HILARIOUS!! He was this roguish, always drunken type of pirate.. funny jokes, witty lines.. jonny depp was fantastic! Orlando Bloom was this soft spoken, sensitive, blacksmith apprentice, and cared deeply for elizabeth swann (keira knightley) basically the epitome of your white knight to save you.. He was brave, courageous, and very very skilled with a blade!! the sword fights and special effects in this movie are flawless! Keira Knightley was absolutely wonderful in the movie. she was outspoken, very strong character.. and Geoffrey Rush, was arrRrr a damn good evil, skeleton pirate! I highly recommend this movie to everyone, and GO SEE IT!!"
5,POTC Rocks,I loved this movie! It was two hours long but it didn't feel like it at all. It never slowed down and it was entertaining and funny at the same time. Johnny Depp is such a good actor with his slurry accent and his little quips and Orlando Bloom is so cute. I expected this movie to be a summer box office cliche with no plot and so many colors and explosions you would start foaming at the mouth and start seizuring(like charlies angels 2).
3,Kinda stunk,"When I went to see this movie (It was a double feature, I really went to see Nemo) I was literally falling asleep during the show. Not only do I hate pirate stuff in the first place, but this movie bored me to tears. However, there were some nice action scenes. If you like Pirate movies, however, go see this."
2,pirates of disneyland,"this movie is for kids, people with kids & people with kiddy minds. I heard it was good, but i almost throw up at shallowness of the film. It is true to alot of disney stuff that we all somehow have imprinted on all our minds. But that is what disney rides on, it's too much fluff for me. johnny depp has a drunk accent threw the whole movie. that's good acting? anyway don't mean to be so negative in a sea of smiles, but I just watched Hulk, & Matrix reloaded & those got mediocre revies & I thought they had alot better graphics & there was better storyline. this is fluff. if that's what you want then it's good."
2,horrible!!!,this was the worst 3 HOURS of my life.i was so bored and wished i didnt see it.the reason it is not one star is because it had good acting.
5,Movie for entire family,I loved this movie I can't even tell you how many times that we went and saw this. I hope they make a sequel!
5,Shivver me timbers,"This movie was the bomb! I came into the movie not expecting much, I mean it was a disney backed movie based on a ride that really has no stor to begin with. But WOW! Right from the opening bell the movie catches you and doesn't let go for the entire 2.5 Hours! The did a great job in exp;aining the story and I loved it! The PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN just pulled disney out of their grave after their release of the country bears movie. Watch it you won't regret it! ARRH!"
4,Pirates of the Caribbean... What a Fun Movie!,"My family and I spent a Saturday afternoon thoroughly entertained by Pirates of the Caribbean. Johnny Depp does a great job as ""CAPTAIN"" Jack Sparrow. The movie was surprisingly funny in all the right spots. It was not contrived or over done in any way! This movie had everything you could possibly want in a great escapist movie! Plenty of Swash Buckling Heroes, Snobby Imperialistic Britts and Vile Villains will keep you rooting for the anti hero. Yes, there was the obligatory love sub plot -- but hey it makes the movie worth while for the fairer sex. (No disrespect intended -- they didn?t have those annoying PC classes when I went to College)We purchased this movie when it came out... a definite stay at home on a rainy Friday night video!"
5,a 17 year old reviewer,This movie is the best movie I have seen this year. The music is great. It left me humming it for hours after the movie. I have seen it 3 times. The characters are great too. Jack Sparrow was so funny and Orlando Bloom's character Will Turner was sweet and funny. This is a must see movie.
5,"An Over the Top, Swashbuckling Delight","The whole film is a bit tongue-in-cheek, but it is endlessly charming and a great way to escape back to those childhood days of pirates and treasure and daring-do. When you feel the need to escape to the land of your youth, this a good choice and one that is a pleasure to see more than once. Johnny Depp is his usual charismatic self and Keira Knightley is anything but difficult to look at--and a charming character she plays as well. It's lots of fun for its inherent silliness. I haven't even seen the second film in this series yet, but I would bet this first one will prove the best of the lot. Enjoy!"
4,"""A"" for Effort","This movie was a decent viewing experience, even the third time (don't ask). The special features on disc two of the DVD prove that this was a huge production, so a four star rating is only fair, as you can't conciously give this movie a low rating. They did try. To watch or not to watch? Why not?"
5,Johnny Depp does it again,"There are only two words i have for this picture: Johnny Depp. He steals the movie from the moment he comes on to the screen. His performance was based on Keith Richards, a member of the rock band Rolling Stones. I was a little unsure of what to make of this movie when I heard it was being made. I mean really, a movie based on a ride at Disney World? But, I was pleasantly surprised. There is plenty of action for the guys, and a little romance for the ladies, and comedy (though some tongue in cheek) for all. This movie has everything. If you are a fan of this genre, or just a Johnny Depp fan, you will enjoy this movie."
3,Digital issues,"I love the movie, but the DVD had some digital issues at the beginning. Distortion, breaking up for the first 5 minutes or so. After that, the movie played fine. Disappointing about the problem with the quality but......still love the movie."
3,Great fun,"""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is an action-packed, laugh-a-minute movie. You definitely won't be bored in the theater.Johnny Depp is vivacious and captivating as Captain Jack Sparrow. Every single line is delivered with bold wit and enthusiasm. He truly made this movie.Orlando Bloom is subtle but effective as William Turner. Keira Knightley plays his love interest, Elizabeth Swann, and fits perfectly in the role.Be forewarned, young children probably won't want to see skeletons leaping about, impalement, and occasional spurts of blood. It is a Disney movie, but it is also rated PG-13.This is a fun movie with standout acting. Enjoy!"
4,The reluctant viewer becomes a convert,"I have to say, when I heard that Disney was making a film called ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" I thought ""what a cheezy self-promotion"" (because of Disney's ride by the same name). Then I saw actual previews and I thought, ""OH NO! The action looks good! But I don't want to see this movie!"" Well, I saw it. And greatly to my surprise, enjoyed it!As a matter of context, let me say that there are a few things I like in a movie: (1) something fun, (2) preferrably funny, and (3) a bonus if it has action. This movie has all of these--and a little romantic interest to boot. If you like these things in a movie---buy it or rent it!!The DVD has lots of little extras to interest fans of the film."
2,pirates = overrated hype,My only praise for this film comes in the form of johnny depp other than that it is a subpar film that is one of those movies that just tends to drag on forever and goes absolutely nowhere .I found myself looking at my watch on several occasions and on the brink of dozing.I would not recommend seeing this at night especially if you want to doze for a couple hours because this film is the common cure for that.I believe this is the most overrated film in fact i have ever seen .The princess bride is by far superior to this megabudgeted crud and was much more memorable! Stay away from this overlong stinker!
4,Not bad for a Bruckheimer Movie,Johnny Depp is excellent in this popcorn action movie and Keira Knightley is good in it too. I was a fan of the Disneyworld ride as a kid so I was close to giving this 5 stars. Also the dvd is packed full of extras on 2 dvd's it's really worth it as far as action movie dvd's worth buying this past year since there weren't many.
5,Makes me want to become a pirate,"Pirates of the Caribbean is an outstanding movie. The trailers shown for this movie were very misleading, making it seem to be a ""scary"" movie of some sort. However, this movie has got action, romance, comedy, and a little bit of the fear factor running with the plot. Johnny Depp is amazing in this movie and really makes the movie great. His portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow is perfect and could not have been done any better. Orlando Bloom is also wonderful...not to mention very nice to look at, and perfects the character. Kiera Knightley makes a great heroine and turns her character into a bad a-- who can take care of herself. The plot is great and and I recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies because you will like this no matter what."
5,A Classic,"If you haven't seen this movie yet, get off your butt and march straight to Blockbuster. It's sheer brilliance.Orlando Bloom is hot, Johnny Depp is hot..you just can't go wrong, but that's even besides the point.The acting is really great, the special effects are really great, I could go on like this all day, but it would be much more productive to simply tell you that it's the best movie I have EVER saw. Everyone I know has seen it and loved it just as much. You will too. I don't care how you get your hands on it, rent it, buy it, rip it out of someone's hands, just watch it!"
4,Quite the jaunty voyage!,"Given the ""success"" of the Country Bears, I was not too optimistic of another Disney theme park ride becoming a movie. By that same token, I wasn't too sure how vivid an exciting Disney could make a haunted pirate movie. I was very pleasantly surprised.After seeing interviews with Johnny Depp in which he mentioned his role model for Captain Jack Sparrow was Keith Richards, I watched raptly as he sauntered and slurred his way through each escapade. You cannot help but watch his every move, wondering what he would do next.Orlando Bloom plays the idealistic blacksmith as Geoffrey Rush plays the evil pirate in control of the Black Pearl. Both work well with Depp, which helps the movie move along.Plenty of action and humor await the viewer. I highly recommend watching this."
5,yum yum love that Johnny,"I thought this was one of the best movies I've seen this year. It was loaded with action and laughs, and of course Johnny Depp just stole the show (as usual). The scenery was beautiful, and it was just an all around good-feel movie. I want to see it again, and of course I can't wait until it comes out on DVD so I can watch it as much as I want! Disney does it again...."
5,Jolly Rodger.,"The best movie this summer. A grand, fun adventure flick just when you thought grand, fun adventure flicks ceased being made. DEPP is simply the most enjoyable actor to watch bring eccentric characters to life, and JACK SPARROW is no exception. A great plot that incorporates all pirate lore and then some accompanies professional direction by my new favorite director GORE VERBINSKI, who's films thusfar (MOUSE HUNT, THE MEXICAN, and THE RING) have all been excellent. A swashbuckling good time of a movie with all the head, heart, and action of a true summer blockbuster."
5,A review from a movie freak... and it's great!!!,"I've seen like, a 1000 pirate movies, but not one of them entertained me like this one. I think Johnny Depp did a great performance and everything he says or does in the movie is really humorous. Of course with all the technology of the modern time, people find it nothing special when they flick from being a half rotten zombie to a human being and back to a zombie again, or the various sea scenes. But I think it was really nicely done and I would recomment ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" to anyone who like comedy and adventure. If you have never liked pirate movies, you should see this one for sure."
4,"DRINK UP! ME HEARTIES, YO HO!","Sure, let's base a movie on an amusement park ride! At first I thought, ""Right. Disney has reached the bottom of its scripting barrel. But Pirates of the Caribbean is a wonderful spin on the immensely likeable Disney ride. Not worth five stars but close.If for nothing else you should watch the movie for Johnny Depp's wonderful performance as Captain Jack Sparrow--a persona that he claims to have modeled after Rolling Stoner Keith Richards. Orlando Bloom proved that he is a one-dimensional actor. All he was was Legolas with dark hair and far less interesting. Geoffrey Rush is outstanding as the eloquent pirate Captain Barbossa.Are we talking about an Academy Award caliber flick here? Not nearly but it's far better than I could have possibly imagined. And it's got the Haunted Mansion beat dead to rights! Let's hope that a movie based on the Tea Cup ride is not forthcoming.Douglas McAllister"
5,"I would have given it 10 stars, if possible!","Prepare to set sail on a wonderful sea-faring adventure helmed by the one and only, never topped Captain Jack Sparrow played magnificently by Johnny Depp. His show stealing performance *made* this movie. Now one of my all-time favorites I can't wait for it to be released on DVD. This is simply a MUST SEE!"
1,Blah,"One question...how could so many of you liked this movie? The acting was horrible, story was boring, pacing was too slow, and the action was bland. This movie put me to sleep. Not even worth a rental."
1,What a Stinker,"I had high hopes with this one, but true to form, Disney let me down AGAIN. What a stinker! The plot, if there was one must have been concocted during a drunken spree. And speaking of drunk, Depp acted like he WAS drunk during this whole mess. Depp does NOT belong in a period film. Maybe a mental ward, but that's another story. Granted, the special effects were outstanding, but face it, this movie was sinking from the start. I love pirate flicks, but this one really deserves to be buried. And can we please get away from everyone doing impersonations of ""Robert Newton"" from Treasure Island ?!!! The two British soldiers acting like Laurel & Hardy was bad enough! My advice ? The entire cast, directors and crew should be ""Morris dancing"" for this dribble. (If you don't know what ""Morris Dancing"" is, it's an 18th Century term which means to swing from the gallows!)"
1,"Wow, this movie is a real stinker!","I am writing this review to prevent others from wasting their precious time and money. Take it from a guy who appreciates good films and understands value, Pirates of the Caribbean is greatly over-hyped and overrated. I am not going to go into a detailed scene-by-scene breakdown or critique any of the actors because it is simply not worth my time to point out the faults.If you are reading these reviews for advice, then I hope that my words will be helpful to you: Beware of this disappointing movie!"
5,One of the best movies made!!!,This move is absolutely fantastic! I don't know what else to say. I can't wait for the DVD to come out because Johnny Depp portrayed Jack Sparrow so damn well that I am absolutely amazed. I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a great amount of laughter and humor. This will definitely brighten your day!!
2,"Bad Story, Bad Adventure, Blockbuster Extravoganza",This movie has the most basic plot and dialog of any movie that I have ever seen. It is quite possible that a second-grader wrote the script. It is hard to look at a crappy epic blockbuster like this seriously. I would show this to my 10 year old boy and no one else. Don't even waste your time.
4,Errol Flynn never was this much fun.,"An entertaining, funny, special effects packed swashbuckler. Lots of sword-fighting. What I saw really motivates me to get the dvd. I saw this on USA & they seem compelled to show advertisements every 12-15 minutes, mostly promoting their own shows, over & over & over. This is a rather long movie at 143 minutes. You cannot fit that into a three hour time slot with all those STUPID ADS. Anyway, I never paid much attention to Johnny Depp before. He is delightful as Capt. Jack Sparrow flitting from scene to scene. There's a slight love story. He doesn't get the girl, but really doesn't care. His ship, the Black Pearl is haunted & he wants it back. Elizabeth is Keira Knight the eye candy & only female in the cast. She of course gets kidnapped. She is quite a good comedic actress. Very promising. I can't wait to see the other half of this movie with the sequel coming in dvd very soon I'd imagine. It's a clean movie, fantasy scenes & very kid friendly from what I saw."
3,Silly swashbuckler,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie; it provides the kind of swashbuckling entertainment I haven't experienced in a movie theatre in a long time (despite being about 45 minutes too long). The fight scenes are well-choreographed, and elaborate without being silly (though sometimes just barely). Sillier still is the script, which allows Orlando Bloom to do things like swim a mile in 45 seconds. Poor Orlando also comes across as a bit bland next to seasoned hams like Geoffrey Rush. However, he's acted off the screen by Johnny Depp, looking like the ... child of Dr. Frank-N-Furter and a Rastafarian with a bad hangover. Depp manages to be immensely entertaining despite giving a highly mannered performance (which is even parodied by Bloom's character). Almost as suprising as Depp are the special effects, which are used judiciously and are creepily effective. So even though the movie doesn't quite gel, it's got enough solid elements to make for a decent night's entertainment."
3,"""..just a lot of violence and action..""","I was expecting a lot more out of this movie - this being, because EVERYONE was raving about it. But please tell me, how is it so great? Sure, the acting is good, and the plot is decent.. but to me.. its just a lot of violence and action.. and thats it. All the girls are raving about it only because of Johnny Depp. But everyone else.. i'm not sure. It's probably just me.. because everyone else seems to like this movie so much. But I wouldn't reccomend it."
5,Excellent film and DVD,"This film has all the elements to be a fun couple of hours; great script, great acting, great music, etc. The two disc DVD is well put together. The film looks great, and the bonus features are entertaining. My highest recommendation."
5,The best art and craft book so far I found,I have owned many craft books and this is the best that I found. My children love all the projects inside. All chapters are very comprehensive with colorful pictures and those model (kids) inside the books are very adorable. I love the feature of this books describe the projects of each by indicating Age group suitable for this art project. That make easy for me to search projects that suit my children.
1,Not represented correctly,"The dinner knives represented in the photo are not the same that I received. What I received are FLAT handled knives. There was no dimendion to the knives I received, they had a curved handle, thats where the similarity ended. I did call customer service and explain, and after returning the incorrect knives back to Next Day Gourmet, they sent me replacement knives, which were EXACTLY like the first ones. I called again, and was told that AMAZON had the wrong photo representing the knoves, and if I wanted the ones that were in the photo that I already ordered twice, the price would be an additional 15.00....No thanks.I opted for a refund. Sad to say, this was my very first order with AMAZON."
2,A characteristically mediocre New Adventure,"In Orman's first Doctor Who novel, the Seventh Doctor, Ace, and Benny fight an entity from Aztec times that is a sort of Blishian Jack-the-Ripper character, surviving on death and destruction. I'm afraid that this book did nothing to change my lack of enthusiasm for Doctor Who novels: if I want good science fiction, I'll read good science fiction. If I want good character pieces, I'll read fanfic. This mishmash succeeds at neither, and I'm not singling out Orman - that's my capsule opinion of all of the Doctor Who New Adventures, with rare exceptions."
4,A pleasant new series!,"This is a fascinating novel about a part of American history that I don't know very well. Shaker society was never really covered in class, and so I read this with fascination. Besides the well done parts about Shaker society, the mystery itself is also fun to read about. Sister Callahan seems to be the only sane person sometimes there as the other Shakers are portrayed as religious fanatics to the point of being violently fanatical. I'm hoping that the people we meet in the next book will be a tad calmer. Besides that one problem I was still enchanted by this book and look forward to the next one."
4,Exactly as Pictured,"These earrings are exactly the color as pictured, a little lighter blue then the earrings I lost that these are replacing, but true to the image on Amazon. They are 6mmx4mm, so before ordering check out a ruler and see if that size works for you. For me it was just right.My only criticism is that I wish the prongs had a little more bend around the stones. It seems as if the prongs are straight and I'm wondering if one day I might find a stone missing...but so far so good."
4,Much better than most powdered milk,"I had this stuff almost every day while living in Chile for 2 years. Let me tell you, there is almost no comparison with the non-fat milk we drink here in the states. This stuff is way better. Don't quote me on this, but I heard that Nido isn't 100% non-fat. That being the case, it doesn't keep as long as non-fat powdered milk. But I might be wrong. At any rate, it's worth it. If you really want to make it taste good just add a little bit of sugar to sweeten it up."
4,Kids are drawn to this toy,"This toy was purchased four years ago for my niece who is now five and it has lasted at grandma's house through three more little girls (who are not always gentle with toys). They all have enjoyed playing with it. It plays some cute songs, the keys light up, and even small fingers can turn the pages on the ""music book."""
5,american hero?,"While I didn't find the actual writing style to be as exciting and wonderful as anticipated (considering his friends were always so wowed and impressed with his letters), you get an idea of how Neal talked through his writing. This is an incredibly important book as far as trying to figure out who Neal was. It is hard to wade through the idealised american holy hero angel kerouac identified him as, as well as the viewpoint of those such as carolyn and allen and figure out who he is. for the first time we get his words about what happened to him in the earlier years of his life. the only bad thing about this book is that he didn't get farther before he died."
4,A great introduction of the beat movement,The autobiographical part of the book was quite interesting but I found it hard to read considering that almost the entire text was run-on sentences that would take up half the page.By the the time you got done with the sentence you had to read it over to get the idea. Now I find myself writing much longer sentences.
2,Just Average,"""Life Goes On"" was not Donell's best work. I know you other reviewers are diehard fan's, but lets keep it real, it wasn't nearly as good as his first album and definitely not close to his second. This album is Just Average!"
2,alright set!,"while I can hear the Stevie Wonder&Michael Jackson Influence on Donell's Voice&Sound He still can't come up with a full Sound.I dig the Lead off track""You Know that I Love you"" but His Albums are too Predictable for there own Good.a big Problem is that Him&Usher are on the same Label&they kinda cross each other out in style.Jones to me is better suited with Up-Tempo Material to me.this set falls into the Cliche Label of most of today's R&B."
2,It's Alright,I prefer His Up-tempo Songs where His Michael Jackson&Stevie Wonder Vibe is there.but overall like His Past Albums He follows a tight Musical Script&never allows Himself from that box.if He did more Up-Tempo Jams you'd hear something non-stop on His albums that you couldn't ignore.but for now He is a Safe Product Artist.
3,Expensive for the size,"A small peice of very roughly finished metal wall art. Be careful with it, as you can easily cut yourself. Overpriced."
1,Might have been funny decades ago... Not anymore.,"The sad thing about so-called ""classics"" of comedy, such as Monty Python or Robin Williams or this pathetic one-dimensional clown called Steve Martin is that people tend to love them for their own sweet memories of youth, associated with when they first heard and saw the act, not with objective qualities of the stand-up.This is a poor comedy; lack of talent and lack of timing skills causes Steve Martin to yell loud and ""sizzle with energy"". This is the hallmark of a talentless comedian (same goes for Robin Williams - watch out for mindless shrieks of this saliva garden-sprinkler). Real comedian (someone who has good text) does not need to jump around for an hour as if he just spilt some acid on his lap."
3,The concept is cute but.....,"The first time, I sprayed the pan with cooking spray as the directions recommend. The cake wouldn't even come out of the pan.The second time I buttered and floured the inside and the cake still didn't want to just pop out. I've tried with the cake cool and warm and both ways the cake still wants to stick. Also, some of the pieces are really tiny as compared to other pieces which wouldn't be nice when kids are involved, unless you let someone have two pieces to make up for it. This idea is excellent but not if the cake won't come out of the pan!"
5,Kerry,"I can't remember who gave me the book, but I really wasn't into Ghengis Khan at all. Read the book, and found myself immersed in it more than I can ever say of most fiction, let alone non-fiction. Quality writing, vivid details, un-biased style. Amazing."
4,Translations,"I'm a Mongolian studies major who lives in Mongolia and speaks modern Mongolian and studies traditional Mongolian script. Because of this I might be more anal than others about translations, but maybe some other readers who speak Mongolian have had some of the same thoughts that I have.The history is good, it's written well, etc. But ""Genghis"" kills me every time. I know in the back of the book Prof. Weatherford talks about why he chose to translate many words in many different styles. For the most part he uses modern Mongolian translations, however he does quite a big use traditional Mongolian spellings which I think might confuse a lot of people. Then to use Genghis, which isn't connected to anything besides a poor ancient translation.In my opinion you should stick to translations from Mongolian. I hope some people have also noticed these things when they read the book. It is just frustrating to me for someone in his position and of his scholarly standing to use ""Genghis"""
3,A good introduction,"An enjoyable read of Genghis Khan and the empire he created. I was surprised to read how small his army was. It was also stunning to read how much affected was the empire by Black Death.However there are sections of the book that I find wrong, but minor. For example, the Germans tank Generals did not look to the Mongols for strategical insights possibly as an archer on a horse is closer to a fighter bomber than a tank. Another example is that the international post existed long before the Mongols as did paper money.Other more serious problems like his explanation of the battle at Kalka, is different to anything I have read. I searched vain for his sources. It needs some sources to back it up. Another the writer has no idea that many Mongols used lancers not bows. It was these lancers, not the bows that won this battle.Overall I think the book is a great read, a good introduction to the Mongol empire but not a serious historical book on the subject."
5,not the guy you thought he was!,"Before I read this book I always thought of Ghengis Khan as the ultimate bad guy--him and Attila the Hun! This book claims quite the contrary to be the actual story, and it is a great one.The author is quite obviously very enthusiastic about his subject- and portrays the man of Ghengis Khan as a great leader and a founder of civilization. The book is an extraordinary history of a man,and an era and you will learn that both had amazing impact on the world they left behind. I wish this book were required reading for high school students--it is vastly educational and is a compelling, fun read. This is the type of book that could make a life-long learner out of almost anyone."
2,Ghengis Khan and the Making of the Modern World,Ghengis Khan and the Making of the Modern WorldI intended this book for a juvinile reader and it was far beyond that.
2,A poor effort....,"I read this as a thirteen year old boy and enjoyed it. A re-read twenty years later gave me a different perspective. MacLeans dialogue between his characters is comic book variety at best. There are also a few glaring errors that I am surprised that his editor did not pick up on, two of note: Shaffer (supposedly from Montana) is credited with a Mid-West accent?? Montana is far west not 'mid' west. Secondly, Nazi helicopters? This is just plain sloppy. MacLean should have known much better.This one belongs on the bookshelf of a teenage boy. For a better read of MacLeans better works I reccomend; HMS Ulysess and Bear Island. The characters are far more credible and provide a better story by far. A poor effort by Mr MacLean."
5,All I can say is WOW,If you like any song by the Cult buy this album. You will not be disappointed at all. I great piece Rock and Roll. Every single song on here I have listened to hundreds of times and I am still not tired of them. Lil Devil and Aphrodisiac jacket are tremendous standouts.Even Born to Wild is not that badI suggest even getting the Vinyl.
5,Another 5 start rating !?!?,"Yeap! 5 star is the rating of this album, that reminds me of great moments of school time. This is the greatest of all The Cult albums and one of the best hard-rock albums ever made. It smashes you with such a powerfull rhythm, with great guitars and potent drums. ""Electric"" has these great songs like ""Wild Flower"", ""Lil' devil"", ""Peace Dog"", ""Electric Ocean"" or the SteppenWolf's ""Born to be wild"" cover. It is a MUST !"
4,"the cult,s electric rocks!!!","the cult,s 1987 release[electric]was the follow up to their 1985 release called [love].with electric the cult decided to go with a more straight ahead harder rocking sound and with rick rubin producing they did this with flying colors!!the album cover is also another one of the coolest in rock.in my opinion the great cuts are;wild flower,lil devil,electric ocean,love removal machine,outlaw,bad fun,born to be wild and king contrary man.as a cult fan i would definately get this!!!i hope they eventually release the extended version of love removal machine which was a 12 inch single release in 1987 and the extended version is great!!"
4,A little drama and some bath house goodness,In this vol. Ren continues her torment of Takeya. There's some history and drama to do with both Miu and Neneko in this vol. Finally it rounds out with a fun bath house episode. There are series with better story line but very few that pack in this much fun and comedy. If you like the first two vols you'll love the rest!
2,Will someone write a better post-86 fiesta book for us???,"This is the second book I've invested in for my post-86 fiesta collection. Again, I am disappointed. The photos do not reflect true fiesta colors. There is the history behind the company and design...blahblahblah. If you are looking for a guide to what pieces are available and what prices you should be paying, don't look here. The price guide is only for lilac and sapphire pieces and is conservative in pricing even in those areas. I have no interest in painted pieces myself, yet a big portion of the book is taken up with looney toons fiesta (who cares?) and other painted ware. I guess I just want a book that shows what pieces are available to collectors, in what colors, and what is a fair price. Great color photos of collections would be nice as well. While I appreciate the effort it takes to put a book together, this just wasn't what I was looking for and is overpriced in my opinion."
2,What color?,"Periwinkle that looks like green, persimmon that looks like red, lilac that looks like blue, I can't tell if the printer couldn't get the colors correct or the photos were mislabeled. Only 50 of the 158 pages had information of interest to the new fiesta collector. Overall, a very disappointing buy."
2,Photo is wrong!!!,"If you're going to have gender confusion with cables, at least have a photo of the product you are actually selling. These are pointless anyways, as 20 pin fits in 24 pin without the adapter. If you have a good power supply, it's not an issue."
2,is it the real thing?,"I used to love Trussardi when I was first introduced to it many years ago in Europe. Then we couldn't find it anymore over there, and I started finding ""Trussardi"" here from various vendors on the Net. But it seems more and more not to have the potency and perhaps not even the the same scent which I used to love. So. I am wondering if the original recipe got lost??? Perhaps I have to find some new scent to love. What a pity!"
2,Too small,Didn't work on my speakers as no way to extend for outdoor speakers .. possible good for very small speakers
1,They really missed it on this one!!,"Very dissapointing set. Definitely NOT the kind of tunes you hear in Pacha. The album is a bit ""corny"" except for a few tunes. A stretch from what we are used to from Pete Tong. What happened big guy??"
3,Um...ok.,"I liked the book well enough, it wasn't as bad as it could have been. But I didn't think it was anything to rave about. I wanted to try a new writer, but i'm not positive this was the greatest choice."
3,Good but not great,Bought it for the 40 run time. Turns out the instruction manual states 40 hours but the package says 4.75. Called pelican they confirm 4.75 hours. This is probably wherever these are sold. Nice light but dont buy it thinking you'll get a long run out of it. Saw someone say $16 for CR 123 lithium batteries Thats maybe for 12 so it isn't super expensive. This is the best price I've seen.
2,"Good product, oppressive DRM","This is a very useful organizational tool. I found it excellent for managing projects and when keeping notes for my fiction writing. However, you should be aware. . . This program will only run on one computer at a time. When you start the program it automatically searches your local network -- without warning or permission -- to see if any other copy is already running. If it finds one, it will abort with a message telling you to buy another license key. If you use multiple computers around your home or office you could find yourself having to buy this program again and again, at $50 a pop."
5,Very Very Funny,This Cd is a very funny collection of funny events that are unbelieveable but are indeed true. I love this CD and I highly recommend that you check it out.
5,Tasteful and Beautiful Choral Music,"I've been listening to this CD for a number of days now, and I have to say that I think it is one of my favorite CD's in my collection. The pieces are very tastefully written, kind of reminds me of Christmas Chorals. Frankly, I can't understand how anyone could complain about it. For the money it is a great value."
4,My boys can't get enough of this,"I bought this toy 3 months ago on the recommendation of my 11 month old twin sons' occupational therapist to help with their fine motor skills. I could not believe how much they love it. Now that they can stand and pull toys from the toy box they always grab this one. I agree that it can be a little dangerous, as one boy fell forward and got a nasty scratch. Although they like playing with the wheels, the cart is not necessary, and I am thinking of ditching it since the corners are sharp."
4,Such a cute idea,"My kids love wagons and they love blocks, so I thought this would be the perfect toy for them. Ideally I should have bought them separately. The blocks are a lot of fun, but the wagon is a little awkward. The cord is very short (to keep kids from strangulation I'm guessing) so it's hard to pull. With the wheels it's also hard to store this on the shelf with their other toys, so if I were to do it again I would go with a wooden block set and then buy a better-designed wagon separately. Overall it's great for the price, just frustrating at times for my kids. I have noticed the paint flecking off on a few of the corners, so not a good idea to let little ones put them in their mouths."
3,Good but Dangerous,"I bought this after reading some reviews on Amazon. The product itself is good but playing with it might be a little dangerous. My 2 year old got a couple of cuts from the very sharp edges of the blocks, so I put them away for a while. If the manufacturer can round off the edges a bit, then this can be a very useful product.Another bad thing is the paint that comes off very easily even with little wetness. So, make sure your little one doesn't put these in their mouth."
3,Paint comes off.,"Blocks in general are great and the little tray these come in is great.The paint comes off these and that is a big problem if your child is under 5. Even if they are older and dont put things in their mouth anymore,any water will start the paint coming off. So if there is any possibility of these getting wet i would recomend not buying them."
3,Okay but I wouldn't buy again,"I bought this for my daycare because I thought it would be something the kids could play with in many different ways and the blocks would be educational. I only let them have it a couple of times because unless someone is sitting with them pointing out everything on the blocks, they don't even look at them, they just dump them all over the floor. When I did sit with them, their attention was not kept more than a couple of minutes. The blocks are very tiny, so not good for stacking/building. They are just something else to pick up off the floor. Cute, but I wouldn't purchase them again."
3,small,I did not look at the dimensions but was surprised when I got this how small it actually is compared to others.
2,too tiny even for small hands,"This product is much smaller than I expected. I have purchased other Melissa and Doug products and have been very happy with their products but not this time. I was very disappointed, I'm not giving the gift as intended. Amazon was very accomodating regarding the return but I'm still out a toy..."
4,Smaller than i expected...,"I didnt pay much attention to the dimensions of this product before buying. I assumed the blocks would be the typical size of a wooden ABC block set. Theyre not. This is a very small product, barely the size of an 8x11 piece of printer paper. That was a little disappointing for me but it will still work fine."
5,Great Book,Searching for the Perfect Beat is an awesome book. It's everything I expected and more. Great designs to enjoy forever. Ahead of its time as well.
2,Not very comfortable,"I bought this watch for everyday use. Unfortunately, the band is quite stiff and thick, making it very uncomfortable for me as I work on a computer almost all day. I also found the strap to be very difficult to latch/unlatch because it's so stiff. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,"Pretty, but band broke twice in one year","I love the look of this watch, as it's small and interesting looking and attracts compliments. I also love that it's a digital watch but not clunky or with a large interface. However, the band broke four months into wearing it. I sent it back since there is a year warranty and it's not the kind of band you can replace. Now I am at my year mark of owning it, and the band is ready to go again. Don't count on this watch for everyday wear"
4,Tub Shower Splash Guard,"This is a really helpful little gadget. It does not get in the way, but manages to keep out a great deal of water that otherwise would seep out around the shower curtain. The sticky tape makes for easy install. The only problem we encountered was with the tub, not the product. If your tub does not have a perfect 90 degree angle where it meets the wall you will have to add caulk under or to the side of the sticky tape to make full contact. I don't see how the product could be changed to prevent this extra step, so I feel good about recommending it to others."
3,tub splash guard,"I was amazed to receive this item and find that lower part of the guard was much narrower than a similar item, that I had boughten a few years ago at a bed-n-bath type store. This makes it less effective as a tub/shower water spill guard."
2,This Bratz is not great,Normally we love Bratz. This however was awful. First her leg broke getting it out of the NASA style packaging. So OK fine we'll get another doll and use the accessories. Not. The mic is attached so no trading out her clothes. The platform shes supposed to spin on doesn't work. She falls off. And the best feature? The FM transmitter sounds like its two stations off. It sounds horrible. This Bratz doll was a complete flop.
4,The first Vicky Bliss mystery,"This is a reprint of a novel copyrighted in 1973. While it may not be the bestbook of the series, it should be read first as it establishes the characters.The story finds university historical researcher Vicky Bliss in competitionwith fellow faculty member, Tony Whats-his-name, to find a lostcarving. The novel is written in a semi-narrative fashion, and ittakes a while for the narrator to be introduced by name.The novel becomes a whodunit as the various characters searchSchloss Drachenstein seeking the lost carving. Various secrets becomerevealed as the plot moves towards a climax. Different people have theirown agendas, and a little detective work reveals both the location of thecarving and the real story of its disappearance. Justice had its own wayof prevailing both in the past and the present.The novel is worth reading, although it seemed to drag a bit at some pointswith excessive descriptions of the passing scenery."
5,Heroines don't have to be petite or helpless.,"And Vicky Bliss isn't either. This was my first Elizabeth Peters book, and I've read it over and over. It's set in Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Germany, and centers on a lost altar carved by Tilman Riemenschneider, one of Germany's greatest sculptors. Having been to Rothenburg and seen a couple of Riemenschneider's altars, I knew Peters had her facts down, something that's important to me. This novel has interesting, quirky characters, it's fast-paced, and has humor. I've recommended to friends, but I never loan out my copy, which I picked up as a library discard back in the 70s. It's priceless!"
3,Dissapointing,"I was surprised that this book got such good reviews. It pales in comparison to Peters' Amelia Peabody series. The heroine is irritating and far more of a treasure hunter than a historian. The male characters all leave something to be desired, and you get the distinct impression that Peters cared very little for her characters and therefore spent as little time as possible on character development. I don't think I will be reading any further into this series."
1,"Not a ""silent"" muffler","This is more of a BMX style noisy racing muffler. If you want ""silent"" as the title implies, don't purchase this noise maker."
3,Super Reader,"One of the elite Dorsai mercenary officers, after a lot of successful military campaigns, and plenty of showing up both on the battlefield and in the political arena, of his opponents realises that he is definitely more than human, and growing beyond his colleagues.He is an 'intuitive superman', with his mind working in ways that are beyond normal humans."
1,REALLY BAD,This camera is horabile you have to be in bright areas it takes like five minutes to take the pictureBUYER'S SHOULDN'T BUY
3,Fun with four players-while drunk,"I don't know... This game is fun when playing with a group of friends for competition sake, but not a game anyone should rush out and buy-and if you do...do it for the mini-games that are featured in this game.It's like a board game, if you don't already know- it's a race to see who will get the most stars and coins... My a.d.d. *ha* kicks in when i'm waiting for the computer to complete there roll... it takes the computer forever- PLUS you always have to play with the computer unless you have three other people come over and play- *there always has to be four players* when it would just be fun to play with your room-mate...Good to own if you don't pay anymore than [$$$] for it...anymore and i'd say you were suckered.but it's kinda fun...i'd buy mario sunshine instead if you need a touch of classic nintendo."
5,THE BEST GAME AROUND,"Mario Party 4 is the 4th in the series of Mario Party.Makes sense, doesn't it? But here's the lowdown on what you'll get if you buy it:EXCELLENT GRAPHICS-they are so good you could just try and jump into the screen at first glance.SUPERB MINI GAMES-Teamwork,concentration,and a sense of humor are required to play these games, which are focused on different themes (e.g.skiing,swimming,and even paragliding)ACTION-if you are the fighting type, you probably won't like this game as it's focused on people who are the more action type. But it's still worth it with a quest for every prize in 1 player mode.There's something that I know that happens if you manage to complete the game...WITH EVERY CHARACTER!! Overall, this game deserves a 9.95/10."
5,MarioParty,"I purchased this as a family game, for game night. My kids and better half loved this game making it a weekly contest."
5,Mario Shines in this great party of a game.,"I reccomend this game for those who like to parr-tay! This is a wonderful mix of colorful characters, unique gameboards, different(but good of course) gameplay, and best of all it has everyones favorite plumber taking the spotlight. Of course Bowser is up to no good, and takes on his usual delightful role of a tantrum throwing, mario hating, princess stealing, dragon. This time he's back with lots of rage, i mean a therepist would have a fieldday with this guy. He of course had his own gameboard which is hillarios, it's owned by he and his equally funny and menacing son, baby bowser (or sometimes called Koopa Kid). I loved this game though it is aimed at a younger audience, but the multiplayer mode will bring delight to anyone regardless of age. This game is a gem in a pool of second-rate gamecube games, a must have for any real gamer. 5 out of 5 stars, most definatly."
3,ARGHHH!!!,"I like the game and the concept however, I found the controller sooooo frustrating!! You are unable to aim at what you would like in order to hose it down. I kept playin thinking in time I would get the hang of it not so. Is there any way to change the aim setting? Great game but that feature took away alot of enjoyment."
4,Mario Party 4 is a great game.,This game has really fun mini games. The older Mario Party versions have the best mini games. The single player mini games are so fun you can't stop playing.
4,A nice game to play with family.,"This game is another sequal to the other Mario Party Games.If you have played the other games on 64, it's pretty much like them. Only this game has a story mode if you are going to play by your self. But don't get to excited about that, it is just you and the computers playing against each other, and if you win the bord match you get a little present. This game as usual you still can play up to 4 players,that is if you have 4 controllers.Ok now I will get on to why I rated it 4 stars rather thatn 5.#1.The game is only fun when you have other people to play with.#2.The game bords aren't as cool as the other ones on 64I recomend that if you buy this game that you should have at least 1 other person to play.Oh, I just came up with a 3rd reason#3. Each bord match always takes over a half an hour usually over an hour and if you play a game it takes up to 2 hours and sometimes more and that is a long time.Over all this game is ok."
4,"In a word, Garbage.","$49.99 is how much this ridiculous game cost me, only for me to chuck it into a drawer in hopes of forgetting the mistake made when I purchased it.The graphics were okay, but the game boards bit the big one. I didn't understand the purpose of the Mega Mushroom unless it was to cause players to loose 10 coins, that might I add, you don't get to keep. There were way to many usless items that could be bought and that pickle-smoocher Daisy seemed to always win the game (talk about your cheese-whiz). But what really annoyed me is that only a mere 3 months after purchasing it, THEY COME OUT WITH Mario Party 5?!!? I've been played. That's it, I'm off to burn that dang thing."
4,Love it!,I may have only played this game twice at my house but it is great! And that was my first time playing a Mario Party game. I'll tell you what My favorute mini game game is and about.It is calleed Book squirm. You are in a book and there is holes in the book so go in the holes or uou will get squirmed. I mean squshed So if you have game cube buy this game!
3,Whiskers and Smoke - A Good Story,"Whiskers and Smoke that was originally published as ""A Trail of Ashes"" was renamed and added cover art to take advantage of the popularity of feline sleuths. To be sure, there is a cat, Errol, in the story, but he does not have a major part in moving the plot along like KoKo (The Cat Who... seriers) or Joe Gray and Dulcie (Shirley Rousseau Murphy). Once the reader overcomes his expectations concerning the role of the cat, the story becomes an interesting character study of an English family visiting New Hampshire. The companion book, Paws for Alarm, should be read second. Taken together they are an enjoyable study of an English family visiting America and an American family visiting England."
2,Fuzzy!,The fuzz is too much it doesn't work if you you want quality audio. Also distorts bass & treble.
4,PC Headset Speaker Switch,This is an excellent investment if you have a headphones/speaker setup and don't like having to crawl under your desk to change them out. Simple to use and with a small footprint.Highly recommended.
1,"My order was canceled, what should I review, bad service?","My order was cancelled after I was told it was shipped. I received a full refund, but I needed the switch not the money. I am still looking for another provider.However this is a great product, I use one at my office."
2,This book was okay.,"This book begins when Say, a Union Soldier in the Civil War, got shot in the leg with a lead ball and is saved by Pink, who used to be a slave. He fights for the Union too. Pink takes Say home with him and they face a terrible thing when someone in Pink's family is killed. But they become friends and Pink tells Say all about the ""sickness"", which is his name for slavery. The end of this book was when they caught Pink and Say. I think that this story is ok, but there is too much blood in it."
5,"If you teach the Civil War, you must read this book!","This book is Polacco at her best. This is the story of two union soldiers, one black and one white, who accidentally find each other after a battle. The two boys quickly become friends as they sort through their feelings about the war. After some time spent healing injuries from the battle, they both must make a dangerous journey across Confederate lines to rejoin the Union troops. They are caught and sent to Andersonville where they are separated. The ending is so moving that you will have to try hard to fight back the tears that will want to force themselves out. At the very end of the book Polacco tells the readers that this is based upon a true story that has been passed down through generations in her family, and there is a refrain that she has the reader say aloud to remember Pinkus Aylee (the black soldier) who died shortly after arriving at the Confederate prison."
5,A Great Reality Story - of two different types of cultures,"The book Pink and Say I have to applaud Patricia Polacco for putting such reality to what we have already known. Its a great story for one. A great story to tell a young child, of what it is to be of one race and then to be exposed to another race besides your own. A great example in showing that we all have someone who loves and protects us no matter what race we are from. Again great example that we are all from the same race the human race. So I have to disagree with a comment that it should not be told to children. If you keep children in the dark how to you expect them to see the light.Miriany German"
5,WOW for years,"I have used Cassini Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4oz for years. I have a problem with perfume changing from a pleasant scent to obnoxious within 10 minutes. This one is the exception...I have used it for years. I have people ask me all the time what fragrance I am wearing...they love it. I tell them what it is, and that it is hard to find in stores...I use to buy it at Younkers, and other high end stores...they no longer carry it. My biggest fear is that Oleg will quit making it...I love it that much. This is an excellent price for this item. I have paid more online at discount perfume sites. Please keep selling it. It is great to find it at a great price on a reliable site."
2,The wife says it doesn't smell the same...,"I got this as a gift for my wife. I have purchased this over the years from other sources and she has always enjoyed it. The last two purchases, each a from a separate source during 2011, she has noticed it smells different. She is using it but it's likely she'll be looking for another favorite for the future."
5,Maybelline Expert Twin Brow Eye Pencils - Charcoal Grey,"While this product was very, very expensive, it appears to have been the only source. I received this product in the same order as advertised. The vendor shipped the item promptly - and it arrived in a very short time in very good order. This was a good transaction."
4,Gram's favorite eye brow pencil!,"My grandma has used this color eye brow pencil for years, but recently the color ""charcoal grey"" was not in stores anymore. My Gram had everyone looking for this color at stores for her...we found out that the color charcoal grey was discontinued.:-(But then I decided to check Amazon for the pencils and I found them here. She was very happy to hear that. :-)I have to say that I was a little shocked at the price of this particular color...it was the highest by far compared to the other colors still available. I think that is unfair when the other colors are like 2.99-3.99 for 2 eye brow pencils...and the charcoal grey is 19.99. That is quite a difference...so I may be happy that I found it for my Grandma...I am upset that she had to pay that much more for her favorite color eye brow pencil."
4,"helpful read, recommend skimming","I thought this book was very helpful. While some of the information seems like common sense, there are some valuable lessons to be learned. It really helps you understand other people and the way they both express and need love. It has allowed me to see certain things people do as expressions of love, rather than hum-drum everyday deeds or comments. I have a new perspective on how to express love to my friends and family in a way that they will see it as love. You may only find certain chapters or stories applicable, but either way, this book is worth skimming and it is an enjoyable easy read!"
2,More of the same.,"I have been collecting the Wolf's Rain DVDs, so naturally when this volume came out I rushed and bought it on the day of its release. However, this all ended in disappointment when I found that I... basically already own this disc. My previous discs essentially contain the same episodes that are recapped on this disc. If you have been a Wolf's Rain collector up to this point... be forewarned that you already own these episodes. I would only suggest buying this DVD for the collector's value, but be forewarned that the storyline does not progress at all here."
4,"works as intended, a time and effort saver","the tool worked as intended without any problems on both the tie rods and ball joints of my 2002 Elantra. thisis not a pro-grade tool by any stretch, but quite adequate for the DIY. the portion of the separator that fitsagainst the nut is very thick and some cars may not have the needed clearance for it. but in my case,no problems,saves quite a bit of time, and no damage to the boots. it more than pays for itself by allowing you to easilychange the CV joint/axle."
3,It worked but barely,Used this on my 2003 Boxster S. It worked but required major grinding to get it to fit and then still required a bit of work. I expected it to break and it didnt so that was nice. : )Its so cheap try it first and if it doesnt work then pay the extra $$ and get a good one.
1,useless as a reference,This book is useless as a reference. It has no footnotes or indexes. It is also missing the preface to the sixth edition. If you want to use this as a reference tool beware!
3,...are they reliable....the publisher is not !,"I just got this book, as well as ""The Canon of Scripture"" by the same author, and so far I am dissapointed with the many typesetting errors. This book was first published in 1959 and you would think that by now this first version would be free of these kind of mistakes. Sloppy workmanship. I like F.F. Bruce's works, this is not a rant on his authorship but instead a slap to the publisher who also included a paragraph warning the reader that the work was outdated and not politically correct. It is really hard to make sense of what the author is trying to convey when you read ""his (Tiberius) fifteenth year commenced in September or October, AD a7.1 The fourth Gospel...."" page 10. I'm still wondering what AD a7.1 is ??!!?? Well the New Testament documents ARE reliable ....if only F.F.Bruce's publisher was....I just want to add that this review is for the - Wilder Publications - version. very poor workmanship!"
1,The New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable?,"Although this book is a classic of Christian Apologetics and receives appropriately high reviews, I must give the product being shipped by Amazon an extremely low rating due to the extremely poor editing job done by whoever produced this book. There are numerous typos throughout the book, as many as a half dozen or more per page. Oddly enough, the version shipped to me doesn't include a copyright page, which I find highly unusual. These things makes this particular version of Bruce's book highly suspect. After speaking with the true publisher of this book, Eerdmans, it is clear that this version being sold by Amazon is in violation of copyright laws. That explains the poor editing done in this book. If you wish to purchase this book, choose a vendor or dealer other than Amazon!!!"
3,Poor craftmanship,"I received item it looked just fine until I installed, Light went up in ceiling fine but when you installed the eye part in would not stay in place due to the poor design of the tab that are suppose to hold it up.. get what you pay for sometimes, in this case cheap is cheap"
2,Flimsy,Not necessarily bad quality depending on what you need it for but very flimsy. If you want to cut straight or just don't want it flopping around look at something else.
4,Excellent First Digital Camera,"I purchased my DX-10 in May 99. While it was inexpensive, there have been the usual extra costs: case, extra SmartMedia card etc. For an intro into digital photography, it has been an excellent purchase. The camera is more than just a point and shoot, allowing reasonable control over picture-taking in the manual mode - probably just enough for a beginner photographer to begin to master without being overwhelming."
1,"Unpleasant, Overpriced",This stuff is terrible. High priced and it is sticky and horrible feeling. It has an unpleasant odor that you want to get rid of. You will put it on and then want to wash it off immediately. Get a clue Jason. Horrible product.
5,"Inspiration for all women, especially mothers","Before reading this book, I had the impression (without even realizing it) that all saints were people who lived secluded lives hundreds of years ago and spent 90% of their time in prayer. This book illustrates the life a ""normal"" woman who lived a devout life in the modern world. She was an intelligent woman who was a highly educated doctor, and also a wife and a mother. Her life shows how devotion to God does not have to mean the exclusion of all else.Read it near tissues though. If you have children, you will almost certainly cry when you read how she refused to sacrifice the life of her child to save her own."
5,Great video of Glen Fry.,This is a great concert by Glen Fry in earlier years. You can easily see why he's been so popular for so long.
5,A really good buy,"Had this CD maker added a short piece, you would have a complete concert program here. Don't let the very low price fool you. These are both exciting and passionate performances. At only 4 bucks, you cannot lose."
2,Not Putumayo,"I was looking for Putumayo music, so when I searched Amazon, it took me to this CD. I ordered it, and it is NOT by Putumayo; there is nothing on the case that even says 'Putumayo'! This is made by Advanced Brain Technologies, and this music is nothing like Putumayo music. I have no idea why this item is listed as 'by Putumayo'. This Playful Baby CD is not BAD, but it's certainly not something I would have purchased."
2,It'll drive you crazy,"This Motorola phone is light weight and nice to grip, but the ""mute"" button is in the WRONG place. If you have any hint of cheek bones, you will constantly be pressing against the ""mute"" button and sending your talker into the land of aloneness. You then have to take the phone away from your ear to see where to press it, this time with your finger, to get your talker back who has been oblivious the whole time and talking away. A terrible design. The range doesn't seem that great either, basically the same as my 900 hz (or whatever) phone from before. Probably worth it to invest more $ for a better phone."
4,"puts the ""metal"" emphasis on prog metal","I'm guessing that from all the negative reviews TOT has been given, some people just didn't want DT to show a more aggressive side. Admittedly Petrucci's solos are for the most part obnoxious (although they work well on some tracks, like This Dying Soul), but DT really serves up some excellent music on this record, a vast improvement over the very inconsistent Six Degrees.DT, who have yet to put out two records that sound the same, show some musical growth by adding a new heaviness to their songs without sacrificing their trademark oh-my-god-how-did-he-play-that-many-notes sound. James Labrie does some new Mustaine-ish like vocals at some points, and some catchy riffs (what?) are evident on the record (Endless Sacrifice). Aside from the lack of melody in Petrucci's leads, these new changes make for a strong, consistent album. I doubt DT will ever top Metropolis pt. 2, but Train of Thought is worthy of competing with Awake for a 2nd or 3rd best album."
2,Amazing!!!,"Amazing that anyone could possibly think that this is their best work yet. DT spent very little time on this and it shows. Many of DT's efforts are hard to describe because they were so original and well refined. How many people here have said 'it sounds like Metallica' or 'it sounds like early....'. That's the point. There's nothing new or creative with this effort. I agree with a couple of the comments about 'Honor Thy Father'. Might as well listen to some mindless, boring, monotonous rap. 2 stars for their talent, 0 for creativity."
2,Progressive Nu-Metal,"I have listened to the entire disc many times and concluded that it's progressive Nu-Metal. ToT is nothing more than spruced up Nu-Metal (Nu-Metal with progressive elements). ""Progressive Nu-Metal this is"" (Yoda). I don't know how else to say it. Honestly, I think many of you who are praising this album actually don't like it. I think you are making excuses for ToT out of principle and are deathly afraid to criticize your gods. I think it's pathetic."
2,I don't have much to say for Dream Theater's latest...,"Dream Theater really lost it on this release. After owning ""Images and Words"" for some time now, I must say that ""Train of Thought"" really loses it's spectacle and Dream Theater's respect. I honestly feel Dream Theater sold out to the sameness of todays music. Yes they show the same wacky guitar riffs and heavy laden verses which I have always enjoyed about their albums but ""Train of Thought"" really loses this. James Labrie's vocals are awful and show no sign of the same man we knew before. Labrie even raps on one of the songs on this album. It is simply awful and I find myself comparing this to Nu Metal. I'm sad to say that I wouldn't recommend this album to find Dream Theater's as always has been ""amazing talent."" Instead this is a repeat of the past and of the present. This was a horrible way to spend $15 of my money, don't waist yours."
2,Dream Theater's St. Anger,"Buy Awake or Images & Words... hell... even Six Degrees(never thought I'd say that). Why this album bothers me: (1)AS I AM is a great song, it sets you up for the inevitable let down. (2)Actual Metallica riffs are used... and often(listen for One and Blackened. Upon closer inspection apparent lifts from Sanitarium, Orion, and other classic metal standards will appear)! (3) The Vocals (4) The lyrics (5) They are capable of so much more!!"
2,Agree- some,"I agree with some of these ""negative"" reviews- but to give it one star is a bit harsh- It sucks, but not 1 star sucky."
3,Tribute to Metallica,"This is a DT album or the Metallica's new album? Does ""Vacant"" should be call FADE TO ONE?"
2,Not for Prog Fans,"I amazed at some reviews referring to this as DT's best ever and how creative it is. It isn't their best by a long shot, and how much creativity gets translated to a solid musical effort in only 3 weeks? Should you buy this CD? If you're a true fan of progressive rock you will be disapppointed. If you like heavier, distorted metal that is not much different than many of the other metal bands out there, it's for you. 'Honor Thy Father' may be their worst song to date.I'm still a dedicated fan of DT, will probably see them yet again in concert, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed for the next effort."
1,Train Wreck,"Dream Theater offers their latest release of first draft songs in full cd packaging. There is definitely some decent material on here, it just gets lost in all the noise. None of these songs needed to be this long; most of them wander aimlessly. The lyrics are definitely weak, with no contributions from the master John Myung (WHY NOT?!). All in all, DT continues to diverge from their former greatness. It truly is a shame. Check out works from Jim Matheos, Kevin Moore or Steven Wilson for some truly great music."
2,"""Two weeks to record"" shows!","The guys brag on the ""making of Train of Thought"" video that comes with the CD, that it only took 2 weeks to record the album ""but don't tell the fans!""Well you don't have to tell the fans. It shows in one of their worst albums in years.I guess I've really been spoiled by Awake, Metropolis 2, and S.D.I.T. I suppose they can't all be great albums."
3,"Metallica...Megadeth, yet little Dream Theater","I read the reviews for this album and found one person bashing reviewers who related this album to Metallica. He claimed that if one compares T.O.T to Metallica they ""dont get music."" Honestly, this album sounds so much like Metallica and Megadeth Dream Theater should get sued. I love Dream Theater, and I think this album is the way metal should sound. I love all the bridges and harmonies that James Labrie elequently executes with his vast vocal prowess. But...come on, Yes I Am is so close to Enter Sandman. Stream Of Consciousness is Orion. Labrie replicates Hetfield (at the end of Yes I Am) and Dave Mustaine's weird talking/singing techniques in another song. Did Dream Theater dump Petrucci for Marty Friedman? This album clearly is Dream Theater going back to their Metal roots but...come on, it's a little too close for comfort."
2,Meh-,Id really like to give it 1 star- but that looks really bad- BAD DT album- (This is my fav band) if they do this again Rush if my favorite band- or Symphony X
4,Give it a chance,"Bottom line: You don't buy Dream Theater CDs for a three-minute pop tune that you'll hear every hour on the radio. You want to hear their exceptional talents. You get that on this CD. I'm baffled by some of the previous reviews: How can you listen to anything one time and know instantly if you like it or not? You can't. Give it a few listens. There's a lot going on in the songs. I hear some ""Awake"" in some of the songs. I hear some ""6DOIT"" in some songs. I hear stuff I haven't heard before. I had to laugh when I read they sold out on this, as if corporate radio is demanding 10 minute long songs. Dream Theater is putting out music they want to create; they're not trying to go commercial. If they wanted to, I'm sure they could. I just think they'd be incredibly bored. It's not SFAM (at least, not yet). And, the preponderance of the 7-string power chords gets tiresome. Other than that, I'm enjoying it the more I listen to it."
3,A good Metal release...,"If you're looking for ACoS II, you won't find it here, this is nothing like any of their other albums, and if you're looking for the classic D.T sound, as said before, this ain't it.That being said, anyone who likes Metal, a bit more technical than Metallica, this is a great album. I think people only disliked this album because, it doesn't sound like their favourite D.T, really Progressive Metal albums.But seriously, if you want a good Metal album, this is it, as many people other metioned, I just wanted a classic Prog Metal D.T album, not a Metal one..."
3,Expected better...,"This disc disappointed me. There is nothing new here. It's not that it's too heavy for my tastes, it's just that I was expecting better after 6 degrees. There is none of the strong melodic themes that made DT almost unique in the metal world, none of the complex song structures that made DT different. Anyone looking at DT from a prog angle is well advised to stay clear of this one. Yes the technical ability of the musicians is awe inspiring (particularily the very talented Mike Portnoy), but their songwriting skills abandoned them this time. If I wanted Metallica, I would buy Metallica. And don't get me wrong, I do own and listen to Metallica from time to time, but when I slip a DT disc in the player, I am expecting more, and Train of Thought didn't give it to me."
3,"After further review, this album rocks!","I have listened to this album at least 100 times now, and it is better than most of the rock bands out there today. They are into new styles, and that is a good thing! At first, you really don't like it, as a Dreat Theater fan. However, once you get past your visions of what you believe Dream Theater should be, you really start to hear that the musical talent is still alive and well, but they have just taken that in a new direction.What really struck me was that it is a very angry sounding album. If you like older Metallica and some of the newer bands like Disturbed and Godsmack, this album would be a great choice for you. However, if you are a long time Dream Theater fan, you will be left wondering who you just listened to, but give it a chance, it will really grow on you. Some tracks sound like continuations of previous songs, and others are somewhat mainstream."
3,What?!!,"This can't be a five star album, because SCENES FROM A MEMORY is clearly better, what would make necesssary to give SFAM a rating of SIX stars, a thing that's not allowed here!"
4,Dissapointing,"I give this albumn a 4 simply because DT are amazing musicians. Unfortunately after anticipating this release for months I was extremely dissapointed. The songs all blend into eachother and the listener easily gets lost in them. The only song I really liked was the last one, the only one that actually sounds like classic Dream Theater."
5,"Finally DT releases their first ""Blistering"" Metal Album !!","Heavy Metal at it's finest boys and girls, listen and learn..... It does'nt get much better than this.... A Masterpiece !!!"
1,WORST DT,"YES, THIS WAS WRITTEN IN 3 WEEKS- WHAT A JOKE- STREAM OF CON IS ONLY DECENT SONG HERE- THE VOCALS ARE HORRID- JORDAN IS BARELY HEARD- PORTNOY IS A MORON, AND PETRUCCI PLAYS TOO FAST- WITH NO SOUL. JOKE PROG"
2,Eh...,"It's a boring mush. What ever happened to the cohesive tight little songs they used to write? Why does everything have to segue into a Spinal Tap-Esque Metaljazz Odyssey a la LTE? Under A Glass Moon wipes the earth with everything on ToT. Come to think of it, so too does Hell's Kitchen, and another ToT: Trial of Tears, from the very overly maligned and underly rated Falling Into Infinity. There's more passion and artistry in the guitar solo from Lines in the Sand than in the whole of Train of Thought.Nice cover, though."
3,a step backwards,"This is the latest in a long line of quality records from DT, but there seems to be something missing this time around...the songs just aren't quite there, there's nothing that really reaches out and grabs you. The brilliance of records like SFAM and 6DOIT is that they feature lots of over-the-top technical playing without sacrificing memorable songs...this album has the technical prowess, but the engaging songs, the solos that are burned in your brain note-for-note after just a few listens, are sadly missing. A good album, but a definite step down from the brilliant records they've made in the past...DT have set very high standards for themselves, and they don't quite live up to them this time."
2,Train Wreck,"TO BE HONEST, I NEVER MUCH CARED FOR THIS BAND UNTIL I HEARD AWAKE. AWAKE IS A GREAT ALBUM AND I LIKED PARTS OF ALL THE REST OF THEIR ALBUMS. BUT THEIR ANNOYING CHARACTERISTICS HAVE CAUGHT UP TO THEM: ""HEY LET'S SEE HOW FAST WE CAN PLAY FOR NO APPARENT REASON"" ""HEY LET'S PLAY LONG ENDLESS SOLO JAM WANKARAMA RAMALAMDINGDONG"" ""HEY LET'S MAKE THE KEYBOARD SOUND LIKE A GUITAR AND JAM ALONG WITH THE GUITAR AND SEE HOW MANY NOTES WE CAN FILL A MEASURE WITH"" please a little restraint guysThis album is forgettable and annoying. You are smarter to check out symphony x or awake"
5,"A beautiful, touching tale","This story of a well meaning bonsai artist who wants to keep an orphan bear small using bonsai techniques is very well written and moving. The conflict between wanting to control, but recognizing that it's necessary to allow growth and development is central to the story. It is beautifully done, and the illustrations are perfect for the story."
3,Apathetic,"I'm sorry but they really could have chosen better songs for this. I mainly bought it for the DVD (which is the reason 3 stars instead of 1.) This has to be the record label looking for a little extra money off of the greatest metal band ever. You have all the songs you might expect off of a greatest hits album from Pantera (Cemetary Gates, Walk, 5 Minutes Alone, Revolution is my Name etc. etc.)but they should have picked some better deep cuts. Every real Pantera fan already has most of their albums, and know there are better songs on them than the singles. Mainly I'm trying to sum up two points here. First this album should have the following songs: Domination, Hollow, Floods and Shedding Skin and second There is no greatest hits when it comes to Pantera because every song is great. Every one of their albums blow this out of the water.Piracy is killing metal, please purchase the music you love to ensure the world will actually hear the next Pantera."
1,St. Peter: So this is your best? Pantera: Ummm...,"Of the 1,000+ metal CD I own, this is in the bottom five. This band is just a bunch of uneducated hicks with jingoistic, fourth-grader lyrics. The riffs are decent, but this is totally moronic truck music for rednecks. Could we release this like the Dr. Dre Chronic 2000 CD (with an alternate version sans lyrics?)Count me out, Pantera. Poison could kick your a$$. Give me some Slayer."
2,JEZEBEL DISAPPOINTS,"It looks like I'm in the minority here. What sounded like an exciting book - exotic location, original plot, romance, adventure - quickly disappoints. I'm not sure I can explain why. One of the reasons books seldom translate well into movies is because the movie cannot show what the character's are thinking. In the case of this book, however, I would have relished less lengthy ""conversations"" in their heads and more interaction between the characters. Also, Jezebel's constant flight from Rafe gets old real fast. This book does not make me want to seek out other books by Ms. Fields, but if the other reviews are any indication of her fan loyalty, I doubt my review will prevent anyone from purchasing her book(s)."
1,Awful!!!,"I really hated the Jezebel of it. Hated her personality and story was shallow. If you like intense, skip this one."
4,Excellent recipes for well textured breads.,"Many bread machine recipes produce very light, too fluffy (Wonder Bread like) breads. This book tells you how to make really interesting, well textured breads easily in your machine. Even my son (who is very committed to white bread) likes the semolina sesame & whole wheat granola varieties.While the book contains some recipes that seem too complicated (you need to scald milk first) or too sweet (lemonade bread), there are many easy & tasty varieties."
1,This book has been a real disappointment.,"When I bought this book, I was so excited to try all the yummy-sounding recipes. Hah! Most of the breads from this book have failed miserably. Sometimes the dough is too wet, sometimes it doesn't rise, sometimes it rises too much... I have several other bread machine cookbooks which work consistently, so I know it is the recipes and not my machine or my technique. Its a pity - some of the recipes sound wonderful, if only they would work. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,GreatRoyal Opera Gala,This was origonally known as the Gold and Silver Gala celebrating Domingo's 25th anniversary with the Royal Opera and the 50th anniv. of something at the Royal Opera. The selection of arias and songs is very good and the singing is excellent.
3,Flashes of darkness in the daylight...,"""N.P."" is the second book written by Banana Yoshimoto. I was very much intrigued by her style. Her style for ""N.P. was very light, although I cannot say that my heart wasn't heavy a lot of times when reading it. That is mainly because the book is about multiple incest. It lightly views the darkness each individual bears as a consequence to the incest, leaving the reader to feel heavy, realizing this is not a light subject.Personally, I think some effect was lost through the translation. I think that the darkness didn't come through enough. I oftentimes wished she'd describe more of the darkness. Having said that though, it was a captivating read."
3,"Good, but not as strong as Kitchen","I found NP somewhat too vague. The simplicity that was found in Kitchen is too overworked in NP. This is still a better than average book, but does not have the emotional impact that her other writings have. The plot is just a bit too contrived..."
1,not purposeful,"NP, unlike Kitchen, is an awful mass of banal dialogue centered around a bewitched story by a fallen author. The four lives, really six, have nothing better to do than pity their own sorry selves. NP goes nowhere."
3,Not sure what all the hype is about,"This is the 3rd book that I've read by this author. Goodbye Tsugumi was far better than this book. Perhaps the reviewers claiming this is her best book have not read Goodbye Tsugumi (""GT"").This book superficially reminds me of Watch Your Mouth by Daniel Handler in the sense that there is a lot of incest. Because of that, it is difficult for a non-incestuous human being to apply the lessons of the book. This is unlike GT, which has many useful life lessons. It's the same with the translation element. Although I myself used to do translation and could sympathize with how you can get drawn in, I didn't find that part of the book to have any greater meaning yet it takes up so much of the book.A lot of nice imagery but I found the book to lack profundity. The plot seemed secondary (in importance to the author) to the primary focus on vivid descriptions of the beach, park, and hot weather."
4,Pretty Good,"My CD player broke, and i wanted to get a new one, so i chose this. The ESP-Extreme anti skip works very well, so i can even run with it. Battery runs out FAST when anti skip is on though. The Cd player does scratch easily though"
4,"Awesome, Bible-centered approach to all relationships!","It's about time someone wrote from this perspective. Holzmann has a unique way of viewing dating: it must be done by the Bible's standards. Holzmann repeatedly emphasises how any relationship with someone of the opposite sex should be a brother-sister relationship. To honor God in every aspect of the relationship, it is necesary to honor that person like one would a sibling. It is putting God first. A must read for anyone looking to follow God's desire for their relationship. A great follow-up to Joshua Harris' ""I Kissed Dating Goodbye"""
5,brilliant (but challenging),"if I were to live the life of a padmasambhava, I would probably start by seeing controversy with established religion as just plain ""good mojo""..."
4,Good song,Joe is a Good Vocalist&this Song truly captures His smooth presentation. Joe is a Talented Cat&this sog still holds up really well.
2,exercises do not reflect chapter material,"My problem with this book is that the review questions at the end of each chapter use terminology and concepts that are not introduced in the chapter's text. Often the concepts in the text are referred to with different terminology in the questions, making them unnecessarily confusing. For example, in 2.3 ""particle density"" is used to refer (I assume) to the concept of ""solids density"" presented in the chapter. Also in the same problem, the concept of ""air-filled porosity"" is used but is not presented anywhere else in the text. There are many such examples to be found. I found myself wondering if this were a ploy to force people to buy the solutions manual."
3,Not so bright,"This is my first book from Carla Neggers. The characters were interesting, but seemed lacking in the ""pull"". I enjoyed Carla Negger's writing style and sense of humour, but it was slightly steriotype. The main characters were good and but did not have a good chemistry. The storyline was just a little too unbelievable, but overall ok."
1,don't buy them if you want to listen to some music,"although it is not mentioned anywhere, these speakers are for gaming. if you want the speakers only for gaming then maybe they will satisfy you. if you want them for anything else, don't buy them. I did it but today I returned them back. I don't know how the alternatives are, but with these you really can't enjoy anything."
3,Underwhelming,"I love the subject matter, but was underwhelmed by most of the paintings. A lot of them had little or nothing to do with the stories, and many were very simplistic. Multiples of the same character never resembled each other, either."
4,For lovers of Sonf of Ice and Fire,Very beautiful and well-done pictures based in SoI&F;'s characters. Also include descriptions and comments.An item so necessary for G.R.R.Martin fans
3,Artwork wanting,"While some of the art was breathtaking, there existed enough cartoonish or whimsical renditions to lower the book's appeal. These bothered me. A better companion, I think, is the role playing game book based on Martin's world. There is enough artwork in it to keep my curiosity sated as well as large amounts of data on the world itself and the people it contains. The drawback here, of course, is the price of the RPG book."
3,Only OK.,"I fast became a big fan of George RR Martin's epic book series, and once i had gotten through the first few books i sought out this compendium of artwork. There are some decent renderings, such as a painting of Robert Baratheon battling Rheagar Targaryen on the Trident, but overall i found much of the art a little amatuerish - not on the level that you might find in one of the many ""art of"" book for films. Still if you are a Martin fan, you might want to check it out."
5,Zoo Tycoon 2 Amazing!,"I used to have this game when it first came out and loved it. Now I decided to buy it, and it arrived two days earlier than expected, plus it was in absolute perfect condition! the best thing I ever bought on Amazon!"
2,Ugh!,"I love Zoo Tycoon. I owned every Zoo Tycoon, but most of them were either scratched or lost, so I bought a new one. I have a dell laptop that is probably 2 years old and I installed this game in my computer. It finally worked, until it started to load my freefrom zoo. Then the game ended with a little window saying something like, ""Windows has detected an error. If we find a solution, we will notify you."" Then I tried the same thing on my 4 year old PC. I downloaded the patch and everything. The game ended again. What's with that? Aggrivated, I turned the computer off. I think I am going to return my beloved game. :("
2,Needs Help,Ok so I got this game for my b-day only to find out it wouldn'tload because of the kind of graphics card it has. So i tried it on our lap top and it worked.what it needs:Ok making the exibit fences is way to hard. I mean I like the way you place them in the first one.the animals always need more space. The biome thing is weird.And I don't think the graphics are that good either. the controls were to hard tyo figure out. this game was a big disepotment.the few good things:first person and phopto sarfi were pretty coolOver all this game is not worth your money.I hope my review was helpful
3,Windows 7 and Zoo Tycoon,"When I selected this game, I was sure to buy a version that said it was compatible with Windows 7. When the game arrived, I was bummed because it didn't state that it would work with Windows 7 on the packaging. But, I hadn't spent a lot of money on the game, and I decided to just go ahead and see if it would work, or if the problems would be small enough that some downloads would patch it all together.I haven't had any trouble at all playing this game on Windows 7, I am happy to report. It ran fine right out of the box, I haven't had to do any downloads or ""fixes"" at all. So, I would say that as long as you have all the system requirements, don't hesitate to try to play this game with Windows 7."
4,Fun but you need the expantion packs,"I enjoy this game, but zoo tycoon is kinda boring by its self, so I wouldn't recommend this game un-less you also buy the expantion packs, the expantion packs truely make this game great. If your a animal lover like me then you will really love this game, its very realistic and the graphics are pretty good. If you do not have a LOT of memory on your computer then this game won't run very well and will often crash, I have very nice work station so its not a problem with me, but if your computer has problems runing other games like sims 2, I wouldn't buy this game if I was you."
2,"Trendy looks, shorts on being sharp","I picked this up on a whim at Target. Useless. Looks cool, but not sharp at all. spend 25-40 on a good paring knife... I'd probably avoid the whole KA line of knives... especially in the price bracket."
3,It's ok...Not for my four year old.,"The movie wasn't bad, but this is not a movie for anyone under the age of 10 in my opinion it's a cartoon so the content is appropriate but not for my four year old. he wasn't that interested in it anyway. so if your are buying it for younger children you might want to think twice, if it's for older children maybe still in to cartoons a little this might be a good movie for them. I did watch the whole movie and I wouldn't play if for my son again until he is much older."
5,"My daughter bought this ring, She loves it!","My daughter is 11 she used her money to buy this ring, and she loves it! She order the wrong size, we sent it back, and payed return shipping in check form, and they sent her a newone! Great customer service, thanks!"
1,CHEAPER AT THIS STORE,"YOU CAN BUY THESE AT ANY DOLLAR STORE FOR 2.00, SO DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE, SO GET 4 FOR THE PRICE OF THIS ONE. I HAVE ONE IN THE CAR AND 2 ON THE PATIO"
2,They changed these and now they are so flimsy!,They just changed this product and now it is so much harder to use. The strips bend so do not adhere to the wooden sticks. I was pleased with the product before but now I just feel jipped.
1,Neem oil soil drench,Fungus gnats live on fungus in the soil and on rotting plant root material. Therefore plants with this insect are probably being overwatered. Ordinary neem oil can be used as a soil drench at the rate of 1 tsp. per quart; shake well. This is a lot easier and doesn't show.
3,"Review, Theory of Elastic Stability","Book is a reprint of Stephen Timoshenko's classic work on theoretical mechanics, useful to civil and mechanical egineers. Book was in new condition and very reasonably priced.Christopher Hahin, Professional Engineer"
5,Good reference book,I enjoyed reading and looking at this book. It helps me identify buttons. I enjoy collecting old buttons and have added it to my library.
2,"Bad 1970's disco...bad disco? Yes, it's true.",Some rediculously good beats and some stuff that I have to turn off. Meh. I've heard better DJ's. I won't buy another recording from him unless he leaves the 70's alone. I love some 70's disco but the mixes on this album are rough.
1,AVOID THIS PRODUCT,"While everything sounds so good, here are two big problems with this particular coffee maker:1. It will take you a week to get the ""plastic smell"" out of your coffee.2. The ""funnel"" is so flimsy that it fell apart within just a couple of months - just try to get a replacement part for this coffee maker. My three week backorder turned into 6 weeks - now I have this coffee maker as a backup - but I will never purchase this manufacturer again."
1,Worked well for 5 months,"I received this coffee maker as a gift in mid May 2012. The unit stopped brewing coffee at the end of October. I called the company and advised them of the problem. They said if I had a receipt that showed it was purchased in the last 12 months they would replace it. If I couldn't find the receipt I was SOL. I found the receipt and emailed it to them. They responded that the receipt didn't have a date on it. After I helped them by. pointing out date they agreed to replace it. They told me through unit was under warranty however I would have to send them a check for $15 to cover shipping. I also had to cut the power cord from the unit and send that to them along with the check. Their customer service was awful. Nothing compared to amazon or Nintendo. Couldn't believe that because I received a faulty unit, I would have to pay anything to get it replaced."
1,good for 6 months,This coffeemaker quit perking at almost exactly 6 months. I was so happy to find a 14 cup maker but I'll just make do with the $12.50 GE I purchased at Dollar General. I bet it lasts just as long! Yes the DeLonghi is still under limited warrenty but my time to deal with it is limited too!
1,NOT USER FRIENDLY,"I have owned several coffee makers in the past but about three months ago I purchased this DeLonghi Coffee maker. What a mistake it was. Setting the time if very time consuming. There is no separate buttons for hours or minutes. If you're setting the time around midnight, then it should only take you about ten minutes to set. Do not try to set the time or auto brew in the evening. Pull up a chair and plan to sit there for a long time. Also, you use the same button to brew or for the timer. Sometimes press it twice thinking your hitting the auto brew then when you wake up the next morning thinking you have a fresh pot of coffee, you don't. It made the coffee the night before when you are on your way to bed. Last but not least, the quality of the coffee maker was no better than the other model I had for over 10 years."
1,Coffee maker,"This item is the most reprehensible piece of equipment I've ever received from a dealer with a reputation for acceptable merchandise. It arrived dirty, albeit-filthy would be a better verb, the water filter was covered in coffee grinds and moldy, the coffee pot was covered in dirt and coffee residue, the coffee maker was covered in dirt, finger prints and scratches. The Gold Filter, was not for this coffee maker at all and didn't fit. And to complete the fiasco, the unit was programed and the time set, and that's the entirety of its ability to work - the clock only, the coffee pot was totally dead and didn't even gurgle let alone make coffee. A one-hundred and fifty percent undesirable and worthless piece of equipment - this unit was never tested, let alone returned to ""as new condition"", false advertising and a worthless piece of equipment. Total dissatisfaction with this transaction and seller. if one could give a minus star - I sincerely would. VpcDlc ..."
2,Dies after a year,"For the year that the DeLonghi DC514T 14-Cup Programmable Drip Coffeemaker worked, we loved it. It made good coffee and was a good design in terms of miscellaneous performance issues: easy to fill and to see the fill lines; did not leave a mess on the countertop; even told us when it was time to de-lime.Alas, all these good feelings disappeared when the machine died just 14 months after we got it--2 months after the warranty ran out. The pump apparently stopped working. The lights come on, but the water does not move. So, let's see. $70--the ""sale"" price at Amazon--divided by 420 (approximate days we used it) means that we are paying about 17 cents a day for the coffee maker. Cheaper than the coffee, but it seems as though a machine like this should last at least 2-3 years."
1,Carafe drips incessently,"Looks pretty and takes up little space, great cup of coffee. BUT the carafe drips where the stainless steel band is on the carafe. It drips A LOT. On every single pour. So I don't recommend this because I presume it's a design defect."
2,Average on the coffee then died.,"There are better makers out there. I was excited when I ordered the DeLonghi DC514T coffeemaker but with the first pot of coffee the quality of flavor was only average. After a lot of experimenting and brewing on the aroma mode that takes five times as long I was able to get it to a reasonable average. I had read a number of reviews that said it was fantastic and noted a few that said the coffeemaker had quality problems but typically if it died it was quick. This one lasted nearly two years before it died, the good news is I now get to get a coffeemaker that does quality beans justice."
2,not good enough for me =),"well i bought 2 similar intustrial-metal cds at around the same time - this one and Unit-187's Loaded. I like Loaded a lot better than this. Supercool Nothing has some moments of near-brilliance but they're too few and far between the psuedo-emotional, uninvolving material on this cd."
1,Boring,The product review did not live up to the hype. I kept waiting for something to happen... still waiting. The hero was too judgemental and the heroine was not convincing in her pursuit. Come on...this could have been a much better book if the plot line was flushed out properly.
4,A Must Read,This book gives a step-by-step plan on how to plan special events. It is a great reference for anyone who plans a career in this filed. I would also recommend Guerilla PR Wired by Michael Levine along with this book. These two cover the basis for PR and events planning.
5,Packed With Knowledge!,"Planning a corporate party or special event? Don't lift a finger until you've read The Business of Event Planning. In this highly practical book, author Judy Allen covers every aspect of the process in exhaustive detail. Allen, an author, writer and experienced event planner, contends that events are more than just feel-good activities. Events, she says, must be staged as strategic tools with return-on-investment potential. If you want to know how, she covers all the basics. Even though the book is geared toward large events, the principles can be applied to functions of any size. Allen includes details of proposal writing, itineraries, contract negotiations, fee setting, high tech applications and security concerns in a post-September-11 world. We recommend this logistical guide to corporate staffers or event planners who want to master the fine details."
2,Don't waste your money.,Another hope dashed. Don't do what they say they will do.Try almost everything to try to loose weight.These did not work for me.
4,It's a great soundtrack that goes with a great movie.,"My favorite song would have to be""I don't want to miss a thing"" it shows a lot of emotion."
4,Nice mid 1800s mystery,"It took a bit to get into the book, but once I did I really enjoyed it. I felt like I had been transported back in time. The one thing that was a bit tedious was all the footnotes. Most of them really didn't help the story and I stopped reading them about half way through since they just slowed me down. I loved trying to figure out what would happen to Edward next since he seems to just keep having problems and bad luck. I discussed it with another person at a book club and had fun talking about the characters using the questions in the back. Such as, was he justified to commit the murder, and were people really out to get him. I was immediately ready for the sequel, The Glass of Time, to see what happened next. It was long book at 700 pages, but the last 400 pages went by so fast."
3,Not bad ... but not great,"For historical novels withlots of twists or turns, I liked David Liss' novels much better, and others such as Misfortune by Wesley Stace, A Factory of Cunning and The Crimson Petal and the White.But this isn't bad as a first novel - he shows promise and I would pick up his next one as well."
1,Extremely disappointing,"My usually reliable book-filtration methods have failed me, and I regret to say that this lifeless, colorless, dead excuse for a Victoriana potboiler slipped through my sieve and into my library.Mr. Cox should stick with his footnoting and editing of M.R. James, and leave the novel writing business to livelier hands. Predictable, hackneyed, and, most unforgivably, dull, dull, dull."
2,Dull,I tried and tried to read this story but it's too slow. Not very gripping. And it came as a recommendation from a great reader!
5,old favorites and a new one,We've been Wallace and Gromit fans for years. Had the VHS tapes and needed to repurchase them in DVD format. Also go the bonus of a new one.
3,"Great episodes, holy ads before!","We love Wallace and Gromit, but it takes FOREVER to get to the features themselves. Also, take the time to read what is included in this set, I ended up with doubles of some movies."
4,Great Collection!,"I love the collection! I had never seen the ""A Matter of loaf and Death"" episode. I got this, yesterday, and watched it last night. Plays great. I was a bit disappointed with the format, though. There are 4 discs, each with only one episode on it. I was expecting all 4 episodes on one disc, or at least the original 3 on one, and maybe a separate disc for the ""A Matter of loaf and Death"" episode. All in all, I am happy to finally have this collection on DVD. Seller was great, no issues."
5,wonderful wallace and gromit,"never get tired of these! I'm English, so a bit biased, but my two american children adore these wonderful characters."
5,A fantastic set on blu-ray!,"I have always been a fan of the intelligent wit of Wallace and his faithful dog Gromit. I did not expect to see the series on blu-ray, but it is a joy that we now have 4 of their exploits on high definition. I had to travel over 30 miles to find a store (Best Buy) with the item in stock and was able to price match Wal-Mart, making each movie just $5.I've watched two of the films so far (A Close Shave and A Matter of Loaf and death) and Wallace and Gromit has never looked or sounded better than on blu-ray. I can give a hearty thumbs up on this collection - it is well worth owning.Some items of note: This is a 1 disc blu-ray release, not 4 discs (which would not make any sense). This collection is also not ""complete"". We are missing Curse of the Were-Rabbit. Curse of the Were Rabbit has to be their best film, so it is sad that it is not included here. The films we do get are great.Movie: 5.0/5.0Video: 4.5/5.0Audio: 4.0/5.0Extras: 3.0/5.0Overall: 4.5/5.0"
5,Ball Canning/Pickling Salt,Excellent product. Met my needs. Delivered on time. Will reorder when needed. Eli T.
4,Very good Book,"This book is a surprise; it is all double blade work. Lots of information. On the down side, sorry but the Tagalog names are distracting. The pictures are too small; it's hard to pick up at times what each blade is doing. BUT......big but..... there is more good stuff packed in this book that in a good 90% of other books on the subject. Get it and get really good reading glasses : )"
2,Not a child friendly book,"The book is innovative in the pulling of tabs. Each page as two windows, one above and the other at the bottom of the page. When you pull the tab, a picture is introduced on the top window and when you push it the tab in, another picture is introduced in the bottom window. Considering that a 4 year old would love to fiddle with the book, the innovative pull and push system got stuck when the tab was not pulled until a red dot is shown. NOT A CHILD FRIENDLY CHILDREN'S BOOK. Moreover, I find that it has too few pages and text for a 4 year old."
2,Not easy to play with!,"My daughter (age 2) and I love the Backyardigans!! She has ALL the books that have come out so far and we are waiting for the new ones this year! But... this book is NOT the best!!The tabs are very hard to work. I worked them for her, and even I was very careful, and yet the tabs would get stuck as I pulled them out and tried to slide them back in. She worked it a few times, and with my help... and yet the tabs broke!! She was very upset to see her book broke. She's very careful with all her things and takes great care of all her books.Don't buy this one... get the others which are much better stories and better pages."
5,Perfect,Purchased these stands for the speakers that come with Onkyo's ST-9100THX speakers (large speakers). Couldn't be happier. They look great and were very easy to assemble.
2,Several Mistakes,"I read this book in order to review my mathematical knowledge and discovered 16 mistakes. Some were typos ( => was used where <=> was needed.); some were factual (a kilometer ""... approximating to 1.609 miles.""); and some were mathematical (p. 47 ""countable (denumerable)"" The set of rational numbers, for example, is countable...""; p. 54 ""denumerable set"" ""The set of rational numbers, on the other hand, is not denumerable...""). I emailed the editor and got no response. I found these in the 3rd edition paperback."
3,Perfectly acceptable but very thin,"A good price for calculator paper, but it's pretty thin. It works fine, I just wish it had more substance."
1,Miller Newton is dubious at best,"www dot trebach dot com/abuse/lulu dot htmlResearch, research, research miller newton AKA father cassius newton. He is not a psychologist or a counselor."
1,Ruined before it got through one usage POS,This was a complete waste of my money. It never got me through a single windshield removal and was 20 times more difficult to use than any video I saw of this tool in action. I have been a mechanic for many years and this is NOT the tool to buy.
1,Use with Gloves,This product is not finished! The holes where the screws go in to change the blade are so sharp that it cuts small circles into your hands and it is not going to work for every window! I not only wasted my time but I am still healing from the many cuts in my hands and my back window shattered because this tool was not good for my 98 Chevy Malibu...If you use this product then make sure you wear gloves as the product does not have any warning labels or instructions! As a matter of fact I am pretty pissed off and wish I took pictures of what it did to my hands so I can sue them for pain and suffering and a broken window! This tool sucks!!!
3,I didn't realise Gaelic would be so hard !!!,The book is both informative and fun but this language is like nothing else I have ever dealt with so I am not sure that I will ever master it from a book.
1,No originality,"Yes this toy does look cool, but I have to give it a low rating because it is basically an older Spawn toy, but they added a red cape. Take a look at Spawn VI (6) from last year, its the same thing."
1,High priced recording...,"Horrid playing makes this music sound as if it was a soundtrackto an Ed Wood movie. The violin technique is at amateur level,with results that make the music ponderous, maudlin and unbearable. Frankly I am surprised that such playing was recorded.Dont be fooled by the low price,.... you'll pay a high price for your purchase."
5,Wonderfully relaxing and soothing!,Many of these pieces are very recognizable! A wonderful selection of classical pieces to sooth the soul...I love having this on while I'm studying or just unwinding after a long day..
2,Electric Cord,"The electric cord that came with the amp was cut, I had to use tape to put it back together."
3,What a headache!,"I want to start out by saying that the noise cancelling feature is very good, in my opinion anyway. I like the comfort of the earpads and the quality of the sound that comes out of them.However.....due to the hinge at the top part of the headphones that allow them to be collapsible, I get a headache within a matter of minutes and cannot wear them for very long before I need to take them off to relax my head.Someone else may like them more than me, if you have a type of head that isn't bothered by the hinge, you have a lot of hair, or you wear them over a hat/cap, they might work out for you.If I can't find anyone to give these to, I'm going to try to sell them."
3,Not for vacuuming,"I bought these partly to inspire myself to vacuum more often, thinking I could listen to podcasts while cancelling out the vacuum cleaner whine. Unfortunately, these headphones don't quite get there. The noise-cancelling works well for low-to-medium volume electric motor noises (computer, refrigerator), but not for a high-decibel machine like a vacuum cleaner. So I guess I live with the dust bunnies. :)"
2,So So - Could find better elsewhere for a little more money,"I used these headphones for sometime now. I primarily use them while traveling on airplanes. They block out a majority of background noise, but the overall sound quality is average at best. I would say I get about 15 hours out of the AAA battery needed to power them. If you forget to turn them off, which I do frequently, they will drain the battery down to nothing and time for a new battery. Auto shutoff would have been a great feature. Certainly not Bose, but they did not cost $175 either."
4,It Was Almost Good,This would have been a perfect movie except they ruined it by putting mermaids in it. I do not watch anything with mermaids.
1,Terrible video for kids,"I couldn't believe what I was allowing my 3yo to watch. Thank goodness I watch the movies with her to make sure they are okay. Well this one was not. Very poor representation for the female gender - has valley-girl -speaking fairies whose main purpose is to be google-eyed over the prince. I did not care for the ""crying babies"" that awaken the sea creature either. I thought it was a poor story and definitely not one that is for my daughter. Too bad I purchased it instead of borrowing from the library. It went into the garbage because I would feel too guilty if someone else picked it up for their kids."
4,Good for five and up?,"My five-year-old says this movie is 'a little bit more scarier than the other Barbie movies'. And she's right. She prefers to cuddle during scary scenes though, rather than to skip parts. And she was tickled at recognizing Spanish words. She did not notice that the voice for Mariposa was the same as for Nori in Mermaidia until we read it here."
3,Not Enough Elina or Barbie In It,"When I first sat down to watch Barbie Mariposa, I had missed the first 5 minutes, so I was upset that they got a new actress to play Barbie (the voice of Nori from Mermaidia). Actually Mariposa was a story being told by Elina, so it was a completely different character. That was disappointing because Elina is one of my favorite characters. But the movie is for my daughter and not ME. LOL! She loved it so that's all that matters! Just be aware that Elina is only in the very beginning and ending."
2,Beautiful animation/far- fetched and boring storyline,"I have to say I was disappointed with this movie. This ""storyline"" if you want to call it that was almost identical to that in Fairytopia. There were way too many characters for a young girl to keep track of and the story just goes on and on with some ridiculous ""plot"" of good fairy vs. evil fairy. The evil fairy who.... guess what?? put the Queen fairy to sleep with a magic flower.. isn't that what happened in Fairytopia???? Anyway in a word I rate this: BORING and really not appropriate for young children as it is scary and confusing to follow. Obviously just trying to sell more dolls."
3,Funny,Funny movie with alot of goofy characters. Scott Caan seems to pick alot of the ame type of actors and actresses for all of his films.
3,ok popcorn movie,"We all know that you don't watch these movies for the earth moving stories. You watch them to be entertained. And it does entertain. It's not as good as American pie, knocked up or super bad. And it doesn't try to be. It is a light hearted romantic comedy that delivers a few laughs, but you wont be disapointed if you miss it. Or remember it long after you've seen it. In short it's ok to kill a few hours, ok rental, don't bother buying, Oh and definately not for the little kids as there are several moments in the movie of extremly vulgar language, if your looking for nudity definately skip because there is just a quick flash of nipples and that is it."
3,me mate?,i bought this album last week and its pretty cool. it really shows us what oriental people really are all about.
3,Poor Instruction. May be better for her students.,"I would not recommend this dvd to most people. While she is entertaining to watch, the value is not really there. She does not teach. She pretty much does the movement and you are expected to copy her. I have not finished the dvd yet because I dislike it that much. There are so many videos on the market that focus on tribal that you can pretty much pick any other one and it will be at least as good, or possibly much better. I gave her 3 stars because maybe someone who has studied with her will enjoy it."
2,Lovely dancer - but no real Instruction,"I wanted to give this DVD more stars - but 2 is all I can muster for an ""instructional"" DVD which doesn't instruct. Fayzeh has lovely style, great moves, competent technique ... which makes it all the more frustrating that you don't actually LEARN any of it from this DVD!Most moves and combos are demonstrated only once or twice. No drills, no repetition. In some scenes, not only does Fayzeh only demo the move once, but the scene fades-out before she finishes!If I could learn a move from seeing it only once ... I wouldn't need INSTRUCTIONAL dvds ...If you want to buy a DVD to watch Fayzeh dance ... there is plenty of 3-4 star PERFORMANCE footage here. She is a lovely dancer. However, if you want an INSTRUCTIONAL dvd, buy Anasma Liquid Fusion or Elisheva Pop & Lock instead."
2,Maddeningly Uneven,"Whether or not you place much stock in the auteur theory popularized Stateside by Sarris and others a generation ago, he's clearly an important film critic well-versed in 30s cinema; thus I greatly looked forward to devouring this unsatisfying book. Maybe he spent TOO much time composing these essays. The tone veers from windy, knitted-brow over-intellectualizing to the gushiest fan-magazine sucrose this side of PHOTOPLAY magazine. Much of it is reasonably readable, and here and there Sarris offers little gems of observation and insight, but for the most part YOU AIN'T HEARD NOTHIN' YET! tries to steer a course between creamy nostalgia and hard-headed analysis, foundering often. Still worthwhile reading for younger cineastes just discovering the films of the 1930s, our richest-ever decade of great filmmaking."
5,Love this Back Pack!,"I searched for a mini backpack for a long time before finding this and I just love it! I have it in blue and use it for a diaper bag and purse. I have 3 small children and find I can fit so much in here while not killing my shoulder like my old diaper bag did. Mind you I have never been one to carry a huge diaper bag (always a mini one), but I can still fit my purse things in the first two pockets and then diapers, wipes (in a ziplock), changes of underwear for the older ones, snacks, little toys, my .75 L Camelbak water bottle, and a small camera in the main pocket. Then cell phone or sippy cups in the side nets. Seriously, do you really need to carry anything more than that? Plus all of the zippered pockets still keep my wallet away from my 15 mo old. It is the perfect size for me and I highly recommend this!"
5,Top Shelf Contemporary Hawaiian Music,"Living in the islands since 1978, this is by far my favorite CD. Contemporary Hawaiian Music that literally fills your heart with warmth and a genuine Aloha spirit. Beautifully done! (I loved it so much I bought two more to give as gifts.)"
2,HP 4600 toner line,My HP printer is 4 years old and only has 2 users - I read the reviews posted and was shocked to read that other folks have the identical problems that I have with my HP 4600. toner leaks and toner lines.This is an expensive printer to have problems like that.Thanks for the opportunity to post my dissatisfaction.
2,Eli Writes Review,"As terrible as I feel saying it, I must admit that I am one of the many people that ended up with this book from seeing the television show. I will however talk about the book and will try to avoid comparing the two.This book.. was slightly painful to read. I will admit I found it interesting, however there was never any information introduce to help the story along. Never any details, never any back-stories. ON ANYONE. The entire book is Chloe running around blind until she hits a wall or some other obstacle in her way.Shortest way to say it; the entire book is a build up of things to come (I'm hoping). The build up before something goes down."
3,If you like the show...,"...on ABC, don't read the books. I read them thinking that I would get insight on the show but instead it was completely different. They are well written books but if you are basing it off of the show you will be in for disappointment."
4,More to come,"Look for Volume 2 to include:A Hard Days Night, Beatles VI, Early Beatles, HelpAnd Volume 3Rubber Soul, Yesterday and Today, Revolver, and a revised Rarities,which should include stereo versions of Misery, There's a Place, From Me to You, I'm Down, plus other various mono or stereo mixes that differ from the Past Masters Cds or unreleased elsewhere."
3,Disappointing,"I was so looking forward to this release - my favorite music, many of the tracks available on CD in stereo for the first time. So why only 3 stars? They claim to have used the US master tapes. The problem is, the US master tapes stink! Although many of the songs do sound excellent, in stereo for the first time (thus 3 stars instead of 1), their biggest hits (such as I Want to Hold Your Hand, She Loves You, and I Feel Fine) sound terrible (just like they did on the my old records), like they were recorded in a box. These tracks sound much, much better on the original Apple CDs and on their ""1"" CD. They should have used the best masters available, instead of just the US masters."
4,Great sound but the packaging has a lot to be desired!!!,"I just picked up this Beatles box set and the sound is great!!! This is how I remember the songs sounding. Once again you can hear Paul McCartney's voice ""crack"" a bit on ""If I Fell"". This little nuance was hard to distinguish on the mono recording.As for the packaging...It is horrible. I am not sure what Capital was thinking. Try driving a car and changing CD's in this package. It is more dangerous than drinking and driving while talking on cell phone."
4,GREAT MUSIC,Bought this for my 14 year old nephew...a beatles fan...the whole family enjoyed listening to the music...and he felt very important for having such a nice collectors item.
1,Banking off of Fans,"How much complitations can they possibly do? Haven't we heard these songs over and over on redundant packages?Buy ""Michael Jackson THe Ultimate Collection"" instead."
5,Capitol Got It Right This Time!,"Completists rejoice! For once, Capitol did the right thing by issuing these titles in both mono and stereo without remixing, revising, or tweaking. The U.S. releases of these songs have some very interesting variants. I view this set as a companion to rather than a replacement of the UK versions. It's refreshing to hear the mixes that I remember from my childhood, especially after listening to the ""dry"" British mixes for the past 17 years. Unlike many of the other reviewers, I aboslutely LOVE the reverb drenched U.S. mix of She's a Woman! As for the packaging, sure it could have been more substantial, but most of the negative reviewers just don't get it. I believe that its ""cheeseyness"" is deliberate and captures the essence of that era. I sincerely hope that the bitching, moaning, and nitpicking of other reviewers doesn't dissuade Capitol from issuing the rest of the U.S. ""Capitolized"" albums. I am already looking forward to them."
2,Check your video card before you buy!!!,"It is very important that you go to the website to check the compatibility of your video card before you buy the game--even if it meets the minimum system requirements. My current video card is barely two weeks old (not expensive, but nice enough) and appears to meet the requirements, but it is an unsupported brand. The game looks wonderful and I wish we could play it but I can't afford a new video card when I already have a new one. I would have given the game more stars since it looks like it would be great, but now I have opened software to attempt to return and a crying daughter who was so excited about the game that we drove a long distance to buy it. You can find the list of unsupported cards at support.microsoft.com/games."
1,Microsoft Arrogance Strikes Again,"The incompatibility of this game with a long list of video cards it is outrageous. No mention until after the game is loaded. Fat chance trying to return a piece of opened software.Microsoft should be proud that they have children crying themselves to sleep on Christmas due to their inability to play with this ""gift""."
1,TOO MANY BUGS,"We highly anticipated the release of this new version of Zoo Tycoon. All I can say is SAVE YOUR MONEY. This game has so many bugs you should call the exterminator. We printed off TWELVE PAGES of fixes and I finally gave up and took it back to the store. I was running it on a brand new computer with all the bells and whistles too. Unless you want to spend needless time tweeking every little setting on your computer and then still possibly not getting it to work .... I'd stick with the original version. THIS GAME SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN RELEASED. I feel they rushed it for the holiday shopping season. Too bad.... left a sour taste in my mouth for ""NEW AND IMPROVED"" ."
5,A True Singer-Songwriter Album,"This is one those albums that reaffirms your belief in music. Every song is stunning, a true shot of reality in a glitter-filled mainstream. This music is quiet,pensive, beautiful, and ultimately, REAL. A perfect album for a quiet, dark, and rainy afternoon. My personal favorite track is ""Quiet and Still"", it has such an ethereal chorus and melody, and the way his lyrics weave with his voice: heart-breaking. A must have."
5,Just absolutely beautiful...,Really hard for me to use the term *beautiful* as a guy but this album is perfect for you and your mate to spend some quality simple time listening to. It's probably the ONLY album I've listened to where ALL the songs are quality. Just phenomenal. Would love to see him come back into the states for some appearances...Europe is beyond my reach for right now..
1,It lasted about 30 minutes past the warranty,"I had this amp set up to power a distributed stereo signal to feed the rest of the house for background music. While it worked for the warranty period reasonably well, it did shut itself off for reasons that never were readily apparent.Then one day, it tripped off never to come on again. Onkyo service is an exercise in all that is bad with customer service for electronic equipment. If it's out of warranty by even a day, the nature of the discussion with the service tech becomes akin to wading through sludge.Bottom line, it would cost more to fix it than the cost of a new one. It is a door stop and I bought two Audiosource amps and am quite happy, thank you. I am done with Onkyo."
3,It's O.K. For The Price,"I mean sound is good but there is no volume control on the front, and when it closes itself down to save power, it is forever unless you turn it off and on again.I'd say it's OK if you are looking for a simple amplifier for home use."
4,"Great controller, so-so screen","I've tryed several other approaches such as software for my Sony PDA,dedicated $$$ range universal controllers and then looked at about everything available. This unit and its PC based software are fantastically easy to use. The firmware in the unit, and the software are very user friendly.The monochrome screen is OK, but not great. I probably should have stepped up to the color version."
2,Very Small Emblem,"This Emblem is Approximately 1 1/2 X 1 1/2 inches.It Will Set you back $13.99 total. This is a flat molded Part(Looked embossed in the picture like the ones on the real truck)about1/16 inch thick.So unless your a die hard dodge fan steer clear of this overpriced plastic Sticker.Weighs about 1/10th of an ounce And costs $6.to ship(Should be $4.tops for both.)WOULD Make An expensive Stocking stuffer and would fit in easily,But may be hard to find.Very little product for the money."
2,Not an easy read,"Tried the sample, but found it to be dry, dry, dry. Not the historical story that I was looking for. Pure historical facts and possible facts. Not my cup of tea."
5,a compelling book,"short, poignant glimpses of the everyday life of Jewish people being absolutely shattered by the Nazis; unforgettable stories"
3,Disappointed,"I have loved Olga panties for years and years. Unfortunately they discontinued ""my"" style. I have tried various brands without falling in love again. Recently I decided to try the Olga Secret Hug Nylon Scoops. I find the fabric to be very light weight, not luxurious as my previous style. The top lace finish does not have enough body to stay upright. And the sizing is not true. I wear an eight, and these eights are enormous. I still like the cut at the back of the leg, but I don't know what I will buy next. I'm not sure that one feature is worth the rest of the disappointments. Please Olga, bring back style 891."
2,Almost a dollar a minute,"I purchased this video after a visit to Oahu and a talk with a practitioner of Lua I met on the Island. I was interested in getting a flavor of the art and ordered the video. One thing to know is that the video is approximately 32 minutes in length, so it is on the short side. Covered in the video are a handful of empty handed and weapon techniques. Each of the techniques are described, demonstrated step-by-step, and then done at real speed. Along with the techniques, you are given a brief narrative about the art and each of the weapons demonstrated. All of the weapons are traditional Hawaiian wooden weapons.You can see the devestating nature of the ""bone breaking"" reputation of Lua, but you are only shown what has to be a very small portion of the art. If the tape had been longer I would have been happy to give it a much higher rating, but I was slightly disappointed at the brevity. I did get a flavor for the art, but wish that I had got the full meal deal with the tape."
2,Beginners only,"This is for beginners only. There are a lot of better books than this on gin. The only redeeming value to me of this book is the description of how to play persian rummy 4 person partnership game. Also, it has a lot of dated material on the game. It scores the game 10 for knock, 20 for gin, 20 for boxes."
2,"Lots of buttons, not so much function.","I bought this remote as a replacement for my VCR remote that broke. When selecting which model to buy, I thought this one would be good because of its price, and because it seemed to have all the buttons required to replace the functions of my original remote. When I brought it home and set it up, I found that many of the buttons were not used with the VCR function, and that the ""Display"" and ""Clear"" functions of my original remote were not available. This prevents me from removing programmed shows, or using the index features of my VCR. Also, with the ""Display"" function missing, I can't recall the channel or time on my TV either. I tried all the codes for the brands of equipment I have, and none of the other codes offered the additional functionality. This remote looks good at first glance, but some additional thought should have been to implementing more of the important features people need."
1,Item returned for incomplete shipment.,I received the shipment but it was not complete. When I called customer service I was told I needed to return it as the item was no longer available. I was sent free return postage and mailed the item out today. Even though I am disappointed I did not get my order filled if my credit card gets credited the amount of the original charge I will consider this a positive experience. Karen Stone
4,Not a bad album,"When i first got this album, i put it in and listened to the hard hitting riffs of Mick's guitar, i luved it!!!. But after listening to it a lot, it starts to get old. With this album you have to be in the mood because the pace of it never changes. It stays heavey throughout and mixed with Tarrie B's good but constant shouting it may start to annoy you.All that said, it is still a good album and if its your sort of thing you will enjoy it."
3,Someone please reconsider the cover design?,"The cover of this DVD should really get a bark-up to mark director Marek Kanievska (ANOTHER COUNTRY) re-teaming with Rupert Everett, then maybe a lot of prejudice can be least expected.A film told by a true story without dramatic efforts, great scenery across Moscow and London though."
5,Good Buy,"Very nice. Works very well, nothing really to worry about. You need a 2 gig memory card? Here it is. End of story."
3,Regulation as fiction,"This book, while an excellent primer on how regulatory policy works in Washington, should not be purchased by individuals looking to gain insight into the fundamental regulations that were implemented during Hundt's term. Using children's programming as the plot, Hundt weaves an interesting tale of lobbists and foes. Unfortunately his almost singular focus on that issue keeps him from expounding on more fundamental, and in the context of the economy, important regulations that were implemented as part of the Telecom Act."
1,pick something else,"looking for a little inside info on how the FCC operates and some background on some of their more controversial decisions of the clinton era, i incorrectly assumed that the memoirs of the FCC Chair would shed some light. all i got was inside the huge, some could argue enormous, head of Reed Hundt, an egomaniac looking for someone to spin. i can't even finish the book it's so poor. all the politics aside, this book is really very poorly crafted. it's not insightful and just plain upsetting to read the machinations about how, through regulatory rules, reed hundt and al gore single handedly spurred the economic resurgence of the US economy. how absurd!"
4,Cheap Fun,"I got this bike for about $[...] + free shipping for my 4 year old. Its perfect for him and he loves it. But he doesn't know Diego so I removed the advertisment from the handle bars. The training wheels need to be screwed in really tight or they shake loose, something to watch out for. Also, if the back tire is a little deflated the bike rides on the training wheels and the bike is hard to stop with back pedal braking. The bike is also pretty heavy for a 4 year old. But it has been good cheap fun when well supervised."
3,"worked well once, not at all the next time","The first time I tried this I was desperate and it worked very well - the itching stopped and the rash began to clear up after two applications. This time - two years later, I used product from the same tube on a much smaller rash and not only did it not provide any relief, I think it caused the rash to spread - it's now popping up all over my body. I agree with an earlier reviewer that it only seems to work when it's very fresh (so don't stock up!!)."
1,Not a cream,"I thought I was buying a cream, but it is a wash. The seller emailed me that it can be used as a cream. However, that is not what the instruction says. I think it is being advertised as something it is not"
1,Terrible book,"That such a poor quality book should come from O'Reilly is baffling. The book is very poorly organized, not covering templates--the basis of XSLT--until chapter 10! The author's examples are convoluted and unrevealing, and mostly seem to prove the point that his understanding of XSLT is far greater than yours. I got through the first three chapters and then gave up for a Sams book, which is much better."
3,Not pleased,I received it with items missing and all disorganized as if someone went through it.Now I have to buy another FAK but not from this vendor. Also posting a YouTube review showing the packaging and how easy it is to open take something out and repackage.
2,"Good Kit, for about a year...","While it is stamped all over the item that ""items my be dated"", they all expire in about a year. Great, so I bought an Orange bag for 20+ items unless I can use everything in the next 365 days... I'm not thrilled since I had a couple others in mind and make me wonder if my $25 could have been better spent?"
4,Good travel kit,Was looking to get something to stick in back pack for hiking trip and this has a great base of the things I need.
3,The first aid kit has a good variety ...,"The first aid kit has a good variety of items for use in an emergency. Bandages, medicines, even an instant cold pack. The case's outer shell seems to be a made of good durable material. On the bad side, two of the three inner compartments don't completely seal. They have a single Velcro strip to hold items inside. For larger items, such as a roll of gauze, this is fine. For smaller items such as band aids, this is insufficient. I would expect to open it up and get a lapful of items."
2,Uninspired Photos,"The style of the photos are dated and not particularly inspiring. While the content and actual information is solid, I expect the photography books I purchase to have at least a passing ability to impress with photos of clarity and beauty."
5,helps me know why,"These meditations are precious. Though I've been in therapy for many years, read many books, I STILL wonder why I feel afraid, why I can't get mobilized, why I isolate, why groups frighten me, and so forth. My ""why's"" are being answered in a way that touches my very soul. It is extremely helpful. Highly recommended, very comforting."
1,Poor recording quality,"Roy Ayers is a great musician but this recording does a tremendously poor job in promoting his qualities as it's an orgy in poor sound quality, tedious songs and computerized backgrounds along with a low budget booklet. If Ayers cares just a little bit about his brand as a musican, he should get himself the budget (and the common sense) to record something decent or else, decide not to. This CD along with (sadly) several other CDs that Ayers has released over the past 10 years are simply crap. Stick to his stuff from the 70s or try to see him live, but don't buy his recent CDs!"
1,Just going to hold out...,"While I didn't buy the Ultimates because I suspected this might happen (as it did with the books a few months after the final one released), I'm not willing to shell out an extra $100 for discs I can't use in the present (if you do the math, a DVD-only set would be around $250.) So I'm just going to hold out and wait until Warner releases 7.1 and 7.2 as separate Ultimate Editions. It may take a while, but I'm sure that it will be worth the wait."
3,Why?,"Love it, however, not enough to buy it. Why can't the extended versions of all movies be done? That's what I am waiting for..."
1,greedy and cheap,"I got all 8 single editions from when each movie first came out, and i have been waiting for the extended edition box set----this certainly is not it----not to mention the price--more than a car payment----what a load of crap- i dont even need all those discs"
1,"Aggravated , very aggravated.","I just received an email telling me that this was avaliable for preorder and I thought to myself, ""Wow! Now there's something I'd love to get for my birthday!"" But then I saw the price. That's how much my rent is and I am not willing to as anybody to pay that price for this totally awesome set no matter how big of an HP fan I am. Even the Dark Lord wouldn't approve of this, Warner Bros."
2,Bought it and the blu-ray discs are empty!!,"So, I was really excited when my package arrived yesterday, apparently without damage (I live in Brazil, so it travelled a long way).Today I decided to watch the first part of the 8-part documentary.I put the disc to play on my blu-ray disc player and...""Disc Error"".I take it off, put it in again, and...""Disc Error"".Starting to get nervous, I try the blu-ray disc of the first movie, and it works just fine.Looking at the recording side of the disc, I noticed that all the documentary discs (except for the last one)and the bonus disc didn't have anything marked, while the discs of the movies (the ones that worked, I mean) showed that characteristical coloured pattern when under the light.Apparently, the documentary discs came empty.I'll try to contact Warner Bros. and ask for a replacement.I really hope they solve this problem as quickly as possible.Sicerely,A disappointed fan"
2,"Would be nice, but . . .",". . . (a) I already own all the movies on Blu-ray disc in extended versions of all but the last two, as well as digital via iTunes, (b) the set is really quite expensive, and (c) all I really want on Blu-ray now is Deathly Hallows 1 and 2 in extended versions! That would be a satisfactory way to complete my collection."
1,PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE,"I'm sorry, NO I'M NOT. If anyone would be stupid enough to pay $450.00 for a dvd set and UltraViolet even (which is pointless), you have lost your natural mind. I would love to see one person buy this. I could make all 7 movies for that price. Good nite nurse as fred mertz says."
1,31 REALLY?,"You have got to be kidding me. I don't need 31 discs. Why not just make a collection with the special packaging with Blu-ray movies, extended editions and special extras only. I don't need the DVD versions of each. I can't believe there's not an extended version of all the movies... And the price WTF? I'm a big fan but this is such a disappointment."
1,Rip off,Total rip off.Made only to squeeze money out of fans pockets. No extended versions and very expensive price for previously released discs .
1,Absurd,"I hope Warner Brothers loses their shirt over this, ridiculous and offensive. Nothing new. Just a lot of duplicative retreads. Even at 30 percent off that's 44. Per movie group.. Besides most of us have the movies in DVD. This nonsense of bundling DVDs into blu ray boxes has GOT to stop. Amazon, if I were you I sure wouldnt invest in too many of these idiocies. Most people either don't need them or won't choose to spend the money in this economy.for this overpriced Drek."
1,"""UltraViolet Digital Copy"" SUCKS","I despise this data mining, consumer use researching hoax. How about a digital copy I can use on my ""non steaming devices"" WB,that I doesn't require 4 passwords and usernames to use morons!!!"
1,Not What We Asked For,"$500 MSRP and STILL no extended cuts? Get outta' here. This isn't worth the price tag. Alright, 31 discs, awesome, but no cases for them and a cardboard box? I'll pass."
1,They need to make a better one! DVD only please!,"What I don't like about DVD, I noticed they ""forced"" us to buy dvd, copy and bluray combo set. I don't have bluray. Seriously! It is really annoying to see more and more of it in store. I don't like them to play us for profit.I am still waiting for all movies to be in one set, DVD format only and also all needed to be extended as well. I like watch extended HP movies on Family channel. Why can't they do that with dvd's??? I am not happy at all. That's why I won't buy this crap. What am I going to do with extra disc for? Bluray??? Useless!!! Yes. Nice to see them includes photo/label sheets and other memorabilia things.Sorry. Not for my cup of tea."
1,I don't need DVDs.,"I have three Blu Ray players in my house, I don't need and DVDs. This could be less expensive if you just took out the useless, to me, DVDs. You want DVD owners to buy Blu Ray so they'll be ready when they upgrade? Why should I give you more money just because you're looking to grab an audience I'm not a part of? What the heck am I going to do with a bunch of useless DVDs? Also, have you not figured out that no one wants Ultraviolet? Again, give me something I want to use, not what WB wants to control.I love Harry Potter, I even have the wand replicas, but this is crap, down right insulting to the fans. Jo I'm sure cringes every time she looks at rating results from web sites offering the sale of this box set, because I believe she cares, where WB does not.I was looking forward to a box set, sad really, I'm passing on this one."
2,Blu-ray and DVD,Perhaps I am not very technically savvy. I didn't realize that I would need a Blu-ray player to watch all 31 discs included in this collection. As it was I could view less than half of the discs. Had I been aware of this I would not have purchased the collection. Amazon is very good about returns but I decided to give the collection to friends.
5,Awesome!,"A really great collection for a true fan! I ordered this for myself about 10 minutes after I knew it existed (which happened to be the day after taking the Harry Potter Studio Tour in London!). It's a great collection, the special features are so interesting to watch, and the extra goodies are great to have! Very good quality and it was fun to hunt for all the pieces. It is expensive, but if you have the extra money to spend on this, you won't regret it.The only thing that would make it better would be to have all the books included. (and maybe a place to stash your wand) Of course that would make it bigger and more expensive, but it would have everything a die hard fan could ever want."
1,Very Disappointed!,"I am a huge fan of Harry Potter but this is a joke and an insult. I have been waiting for this box set in blue ray to come out but is not especial as its look. No extended edition for all movies plus ultraviolet digital copy come on, this format never worked properly. All I can see with this Box set is that I'm going to pay $350 for a pretty box, cuz everything else I already have.... I WILL NOT BUY THIS!!!"
1,No Real Value,"This is very disappointing. I have to agree with the other commenters that this package provides little additional value to all the discs and packages that have come before and we've purchased. I'll wait for the extended editions of all the movies to be offered. As for UV, it's a scam. If I pay for a digital copy, I want a physical disc I can use for all my devices especially since these are constantly changing."
1,Insulting for fans. DO NOT BUY!,"Let me put this in the short version.First off, i love Harry Potter, its my childhood and a treasure part of my life.But this box set is overpriced and insulting.- NOTHING new is included. Extended cuts? Nope- Its more expensive than buying seperately.- Cheaper to buy what you dont own.EVEN if you own none of the blurays, its easy to get each of the 8 films for 13 bucks each, so lets count.13X8= $104This is just insulting double dipping. Its obvious theres going to be another ultimate edition, LOTR did this too, but at least they never overpriced their sets.Harry potter deserves more than this milking. Paying 200 bucks is not worth for some cheap box and toys. Wait for another set.DO NOT BUY THIS SET for anything MORE THAN 100 bucksoh and most of the 30+ Discs are DVD's for digital copies so dont bother talking about the value of the discs."
1,HARRY POTTER WIZARD'S COLLECTION(BLU-RAY/DVD COMBO),i have all of the dvd's as most fans do. i am waiting for the release of all 8 movies in extended versions. unfortunately this set is not that. i'll have to keep waiting. this set is a big disappointment.
1,It's Just Not Worth it...,"It's releases similar to this one that do not help further Blu-ray purchases. Repackaging the same material and adding one additional disc with ""5 hours of never-before-seen- features"" is not going to get me to spend $40 per movie of movies I already own. It doesn't matter that it is one big box. What would matter to me would be if the set included the extended versions and outtakes from each movie. I don't understand why they changed the the original strategy of releasing ""Ultimate Editions"" with all the material the fans wanted. After releasing the first two movies with extended versions in the UE, subsequent movies did not include the extended feature, only the theatrical version. All this new box set contains is all of the same UE content repackaged with one additional disc. ABC Family plays the extended versions of the movies periodically during ""HP weekend"" fairly often. I just DVR it and skip the commercials and see the movies I want that way."
1,Wow WB,"Just writing this to try and bring the rating down. This is ridiculous, they didn't even include the extended cut. We dont need every disc on DVD as well as bluray their just padding the box. And ultraviolet seriously?"
5,"If you don't have this, but it NOW!",I am so happy that I bought this. It is really fun to explore the world of Harry Potter with my friends and family! All die hard HP fans should get their hands on this Collection!
2,Lets all take a deep breath,"People, people, people.....this is exactly what WB wants with this HP collection. The price will start high ( lot higher than I thought ). After a few months of fan complaints it will be lowered; as we see. Soon it will be in $200's by christmas and ppl will get the urge to splurge. By that time fans will think it is an ok-ish price and several ppl will began buying the collection. I honestly do not see myself buying it anytime soon. Love HP, but my pocket book does not"
2,Actual price - $500,hmmm...the actual price is $500 and down to $350. At $500 I could buy an Ipad 2 with accessories - at $350 i could buy a tablet with accessories too - what a value this box set is!
5,Love it!,"Omg got this as a bday present and love it so much! I grew up reading and watching Harry Potter and this movie set is just the icing on the cake! It comes with the movies in multiple versions, a cloth map of Hogwarts and the grounds, a certificate of the number box you have out of the 63,000 that have been made. I got a Slytherin locket that is made of good quality and opens up for me to put something inside like a picture or maybe a note from R.A.B lol. The code to watch the movies online is wrapped up like scroll and tied with a black ribbon. It's got secret compartments, black and white sketches, and colored pictures of important scenes from the movie. If you're a Harry Potter fan you will squeal with delight when you get the package and open it up. Get ready for a movie marathon!!!!"
1,This is wrong...,"Where is the release of HP7 Ultimate Editions on Blue Ray. This is just wrong. When they threatened to pull everything from shelves, I ordered 1-6 in ultimate edition. Now, if this is going to be the only way to get 7 in ultimate edition, I'm calling BS. I'm not spending $350 to get stuff I already spent $200 to get (+2 new movies). That's stupid. Come on WB. Give us Ultimite 7s."
1,Why does ABC Family Channel get all the extended cuts?,"I think $350 is a FAIR price. But only if you give us all the extended cuts, decent packaging, all previously released features PLUS. When I first saw this available on Amazon I preordered it. Needless to say I've long since cancelled my order for this rehashed box of previously released material. I hope they don't sell a single box."
1,350 DOLLARS FOR A FANCY BOX!!!,"I was hoping after the Blu Ray theatrical barebones editions of the Harry Potter series, that there would be an ultimate collection with TONS of unseen footage. Basically You're paying 350 dollars for a fancy box movies and movies you have already seen. And the price of 350 dollars is absolutely RIDICULOUS!!! Star Wars was only 80-90 Dollars and It was the most popular franchise ever, and had a decent amount of extra features!!!"
1,What's the Point?,No extended versions of the last 6 films? Why not? Extended versions of many of these films have been broadcast on TV. What's the problem? I think I'll pass.
2,Too high,This is way over priced. There is no way I would pay $350.00 let alone $500.00 for this. Buy them individually...make your own cardboard box.
1,Not worth the money,"I think the price for this is rather steep especially since they've already released all of the movies, and really, who doesn't have all of the movies by now? As many have already said, it would be worth it if there were actually things we have not seen, such as extended editions of the other movies, but as is such, that's not going to happen so the price should reflect what has been provided. I'm sorry, but I would not pay this kind of money to buy the movies again, and to see what I've already seen."
1,Such a disappointment for a long wait,"Like everyone else, I've been waiting for this collector's edition set. I've refrained from buying any blu rays so I could get this set. What a disappointment!!!"
5,Nostalgia,"I suppose that I'm getting nostalgic. I'm only 39 but I keep opening my reviews with I remember. So I'll do it again. I remember being at Cornerstone. It was either 90 or 91. (What's funnier? What you remember or what you don't?) I was sitting in Ramald Domkus's (of Scaterd Few) tent. And there was a couple of young Philipino kid's playing him their 8 track demo tape. It was Jerome and Gyro playing Him the sketches of the songs that would end up on this record. We were all blown away. This is a cassette 8 track? How'd you get the samples. This was a world before Logic and Pro-tools. Even Hip-hop was still young.Any Way This album has followed me around the world, albiet in cassette form. And even if it is a album that gets played once or twice a year (I am a bit older now, you can do the math if you want to know how old I was in 90,) it was time to find it on C.D. Thank God for the internet and Amazon.com."
1,NOT REGION 1,"This dvd (and others from the same manufacturer) will not play in any of my DVD players. They will play in my computer, which tells me that this is not a region 1 DVD."
1,This is easily the worst movie ever made,"Please do not get this movie, you will be so depressed. It hurt so much to watch it. I honestly thought I was gonna throw up a couple of times. By fast forwarding A LOT I made it to the final fight and it was even more dreadful than the movie itself. Gordon Liu is in this but I beg you not to watch it. I don't know if Gordon was drugged and then forced to show up for a day on the set or what. He plays an emperor or something and then he shows up in the final fight in rags??? So if you make it through this thing, you may not leave the house for a while due to internal injuries sustained from this horrid viewing. Call 911 if you are hurt badly."
3,"Good, but not the best Barney birthday video","This video was a good birthday video for different cultures and seemed very entertaining for us. However, it wasn't the best Barney birthday video in my opionion. I ended up purchasing My Party with Barney from Kideo.com. Parents, if your child doesn't like Barney's Birthday, I suggest My Party with Barney. Kideo puts your child's face on the screen and Barney says your child's name over and over again. (example: Abby, happy birthday!) Purchase My Party with Barney if your son/daughter dislikes Barney's Birthday."
2,Got for little brother with Down's Syndrome,"He likes it a lot, however I think he has realized that he can search YouTube for most of these episodes."
3,"Good sound, but too much base","These were bought for my dad's computer. He has an intergrated sound card, but the speakers sound great.The only thing i did not like is that the subwoofer is very over powering, and would sound awful from the other room. And the subwoofer does not have a way of adjusting the bass, so it was stuck like that.The only way i could componsate for this is using a program with ajustable base.After that though they sound great."
2,No bass level control!,"The speakers sound good, but there is no seperate control to turn the bass down. It is set way too high and I can't find any software controls to turn it down a bit. I have seen some pretty [inexpensive] 3-piece speakers, but they always have a control for the woofer, this set assumes that you want too much bass.I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Unreliable,"I have run this UPS for several months (4), and upon first set up I tripped my breaker to ensure that the battery fail over would work. All of the read outs on the display looked good power settings where fine and the load readout showed 1 bar (the lowest level). 1st power outage, all attached devices shut off! I have an older APC Ups attached to the same outlet, that was running 3 monitors and a rather beefy pc (no issues). All self performed tests unplugging it from the wall etc worked great, however every time we experienced an actual outage the devices attached to this UPS lost power. If you cant rely on the UPS to be UN-INTERRUPTIBLE then its worthless. I don't think I can ever trust this brand, you simply cant have devices like this fail, the products attached to them are to valuable."
4,An Electronic Equipment Saver,"It may be better than I know, if I knew what was involved in providing it with power while it shuts down appropriately when the power goes off. Regardless it prevents surges and outages from destroying my computer and printerd."
1,failed after a week then caught fire when i turned it back on,"trying to figure out how to get a refund--Amazon policy says they don't take returns on ""hazardous items"" so may take some work :-(i have a second UPS from CyberPower on the way, but am looking into cancelling before it arrives if i an. CyberPower a little cheaper than APC, but i've used APC for 19 years and never had a failure.looking like APC is worth the extra $ after all!!PS: Amazon immediately filed a refund of my costs upon email request. disposal of the unit was left to me."
4,Reliable product. A bit HEAVY for its size but does the job.,A bit HEAVY for its size but does the job! I recommend this for all your computer related sources for an emergency backup.
4,Great battery backup,This is must needed product to control battery levels.I sleep better at night.I love the LCD display.
5,Good UPS,The unit has worked well since I bought it in January of 2011.We use to suffer from brown outs and the occasional power failure.The PowerPanel software is easy to install and use.You can configure several settings like whether to preserve battery life or keep the computer running during a power outage.The software also shows you how many watts you are drawing and the voltage.You can also schedule the device to turn off and on.
1,Useless piece of junk if you have Active Power Factor Correction (Active PFC),"I had this UPC for several months and it seemed to work OK.The first time I had a power outage, I found that the PC reboots whenever the power goes out.It then fails over to battery and boots back up.I am informed by Customer Support that my PC power supply has Active Power FactorCorrection (Active PFC)which supposedly causes incompatible UPS units to make the PC reboot.When I bought the UPS here, it did not say anywhere ONLY WORKS WITH CERTAIN LIMITED PC POWER SUPPLIES, which now turns out to be the case.If you are just an average PC user that doesn't know squat about power supplies like I don't, LOOK OUT FOR THIS PRODUCT!If you expect your PC NOT to reboot when there is a blackout, STAY AWAY FROM THIS UPS or carefully check your power supply first.Also note that you cannot even return UPS to Amazon because of the battery, so expect to be STUCK WITH THIS PIECE OF JUNK."
1,Amazon confuses the Issues,"Reviews lose their worth when they are listed as applying to multiple products. It looks like Amazon groups all reviews for similar, but distinctly different, models of uninterruptible power supplies. Just because two items share a logo does not mean that they are equivalent. Having reviews for different models of power supplies from the same company is more disengenuous than it would be to combine reviews of televisions that differ only in the brand name that stamped on the outside of the case. I would like to compare UPS's by reading reviews from users but, in this case, Amazon's customer reviews are not helpful. (They have similar problems with Reviews of DVD's that are issued on different dates and by different publishers with radically different quality.)"
2,Came poorly packaged and scruff marked.,"Actually, don't know how good the product is yet. Will be installing tomorrow. But seller sent the package with as little padding as possible. I open the shipping box and product box was crushed on both ends. Remove the UPS and there are chunks missing on the outside casing. Not what I expected in a new product. The product was not taped, so I am worried it is a used product. I will update tomorrow if there is an issue with UPS outside of appearance."
5,excellent back up power supply,I purchased the CyberPower 1350 to replace an APC unit. The CyberPower installed without a hitch and is very intelligent. Programmable on and off times with extensive record keeping of events displayed both on the computer and on the display. Plenty of outlets and filtering for cable and phone lines included. Very highly recommended.
5,Perfect,I have stopped buying APC and have bought several CyberPower units of recent. I like how they show you the current usage and much cheaper than APC. Also AVR (automatic voltage regulator) is a plus.
4,Watch out for little fingers...,"This seems great, love the lcd menu. The only button to navigate through the display seems a little hairy. We are using this to keep everything up in our entertainment center running w/ clean power & to help w/ brownouts. So it works perfect for us. Only bad thing is the very attractive bright blue light on the front, its the master power switch. You don't have to hold it in to turn everything off, a simple press & release does the trick. Our little one's are attracted to its blue light & the little fingers want to press that button all the time; killing everything powered on. I have to come up w/ a way to cover that button or somehow hide the whole unit. A little disappointed in the advertised uptime & the actual uptime that the batteries will last, but maybe because I have a 40 inch lcd tv plugged into it. It matches all other black entertainment hardware fine. Overall, I do recommend this UPS."
5,Buy it.,"This is an outstanding UPS. I have had one for years and it never fails while my APS fails all the time. So, I replaced all of the APS's and now I never have an issue. I just replaced all of the APS UPS' in the server rack at work with CyberPower units. Now I sleep well at night."
5,So far so good,"This battery backup came well packaged and unlike some other brands does not require a screwdriver and child hands to hook up the battery before first use. The battery comes already plugged in! Who would of thought? I've worked in IT for years, have had all of the different brands, and the Cyberpower works just as well as all of the others. I've seen $300 APCs die within the first year as well as all of the other brands, it really is just luck of the draw these things. At the time, this model was the cheapest for the power rating, it has worked reliably thus far and I have not had the beeping issue. My house is 100 years old with very ""touchy"" wiring. So, if the power output in my lines isn't causing the beeping fault, I really don't foresee most people running into that issue. Also, as another reviewer stated, that beep can be programmed off by hooking the unit to a laptop and installing the software."
4,Great UPS for price,Need UPS's for many different IT needs. This is one I constantly buy for small servers and work stations that have critical up time.
5,Great Product.,"I have three CyberPower UPS backup devices. They have already come into action once so far, due to heavy winds that knocked out a nearby transformer."
4,It seems to work well,I've had a couple power outages and it has kept things running. I like the led on the front. It has a little hum to it.
4,"OK, trying again","Well i have quite a story of this product.I have had it for two weeks, and our power sucks, so it has gone out about8 times in that time anywhere from 2 min to 6 hours. It worked everytime and shutdown my PC and my file server. At the last power outage, we were thinking there may be a tornado. I had turned off the UPS, so i turned it back on and immediately pressed the power button on my computer. That was a mistake. The shorted, and blew.After examining it and reading the directions i feel it was kind of my fault. So if anyone gets this keep the power button on when it is working on battery. And always wait for the end of the beep the UPS gives when it turns on before powering anything on. I am going to get another one and see how it works out."
5,3 New Units,Orderd 3 New. 1st one was so dusty and used other 2 were new. They all working okay. But so disappointed paying for brand new and getting one used.
4,Does a good job,"The whole unit is really great. The software that comes with it is a little flaky (keeps telling me to enable hibernation even though it is). Only issue I really have with it so far is that the spacing of the outlets could be a bit larger to accommodate transformers (currently only one on the batter side could go in without blocking another port). Also, when plugging my coax in, I constantly had network issues. Not sure why but it really screwed with my router of all things. Not sure what the deal with that was but there you have it. Perhaps I'm just the lucky one.Otherwise, this is an excellent UPS. Appearance is nice and the display is simple and quite informative."
5,"Works Great, used for the past year","In years past, I always bought APC, but was growing tired of the cost and limited lifespan. I began trying out the CyberPower units just over a year ago. I have several of the 1500, 1350, and 1000, and so far they have kept my equipment up and protected through many thunderstorms and power outages. I wish the software and calibration were a little better, but this is probably the only area I miss the APC. I liked being able to crank in the default tolerances on the voltage, but for the price + performance, you won't really miss that, and most electronic equipment can deal with larger voltage fluctuations than this UPS will allow."
1,LCD FAILURE,"So the unit was purchased in December of 2010 and today (6-8-11) the lcd took a dump. The other electronics that protect the voltages going to my components are still working. So I'm going to go ahead and see how long the rest of the electronics last. According to some reviews, I'm not very hopeful. I could take the company up on their warranty but then I may risk damage to whats plugged into it while its out for warranty repair. Might as well take the chance. Too bad the company wouldn't send me a new unit on consignment until they get my broken one! That would be ideal. I would not buy this brand again."
5,prevents system crashes and total loss of data,"In my location out in rural area i am subjected to frequent power outages from just a blink to several min. I have experienced 3 during backup that wiped system (win 7) files and/or data or both. All required many hrs of frustrating system reinstallation. Blue screen of death, corrupted os, and black screen,(turned out to be corrupted flash bios),been there. This UPS deliveres the 700+ watts my pc needs to get to a safe shut down. I have had numerous power outages since without a single glitch getting through. I live in the lightning capital of the US,CyberPower CP1350AVRLCD Intelligent LCD Green UPS - 1350VA/810W AVR 8-Outlet RJ11/45/Coaxif not the world and it has stopped every surge. Buy it, trust it. sjhanc"
4,Excellent UPS,"I've only used it for a week now, but so far I am impressed with the quality and function. I have this at home, it's one of 8 UPS systems, all the otehrs are APC. I've been a APC fan, but comparing cost and features of APC to this unit... I have to say I'll buy more Cyberpower in the future.I have a comprehensive network, and this unit is not dedicated to a PC ... so the only reason I haven't given this a 5 was no network/ethernet interface and management (USB only). That, and I wish there were more battery ports for low-power devices (small routers, switches, cameras, etc). But it's exactly as advertised, I feel at a good price point for the features."
5,Good Product,"Works flawlesssly...set it up on your PC or not and forget it. Has some cool features. Buy it, for the money it.works as good as any comparable APC product."
4,CAUTION: HABIT FORMING !,"I have not seen this since I was a kid. You should have seen me trying to get the INNER wrapper off, which is edible. What a dope.It dawned on me the wrapper was rice paper? and I started popping them, then shared them with my grandson who adores them. They are like a rich man's Skittles. Taste better, less sticky on the teeth, a pleasant strawberry flavor.I'm hooked."
5,Yum,The first time i ate this i found it in our garage and popped it in my mouth. it is still my favorite candy and i recommend it to anybody.
5,More Than Another Christmas Story,"A small boy finds Shadow, a rocking horse, under the Christmas Tree. In his imagination, the two ride to the West, joust, race Seattle Slew in the Kentucky Derby, and go on safari. But then the inevitable happens: the boy starts to grow up, as boys always have and always will (it's at this point I have a hard time reading this to my five year old without pretending there's something in my eye). Shadow ends up in the attic. Years pass.And then the boy's own little boy finds Shadow (as I read this part to my son, there's more pretending that I have something in my eye). Shadow's spirit returns, and they ""flew through the sky all Christmas Eve and didn't come home until dawn.""The illustrations of this book are some of the best I've ever seen; the facts of growing up are utterly convincing. This book is delightful and devastating. And there's no need to wait for Christmas to read it: we're Jewish, and we read it all year round."
1,Overly academic,"I found this book through a newspaper review and eagerly bought it. I was very disappointed. It is overly academic, dull, poorly organized and excessively wordy. As a journalist, I understand the powers of brevity and clarity, but the author does not. Even the organization, by month, leaves a lot to be desired as the author still skips between months. The political background becomes so laborious that it is impossible to follow a chain of events or personalities. I would definitely skip reading this book, even though I forced my way through all of it, hoping that it would get better. It did not."
2,Too much like a textbook,"This book has lengthy sections that are very boring, about as much fun as reading a textbook. And to echo some of the other reviews, the author indulges in too many cliches, such as ""...trapped like squirrels"". What? Considering the topic, this could have been a page-turner, say like ""Young Men and Fire"". Say yourself a lot of boredom and read that instead."
4,Important work if one understands its place,"This is an important work, helping to document the validity of herbal medicine. However, it is not an all-encompassing work and obviously isn't referenced. Nevertheless, the German Commission E's method of publishing monographs based on the information gathered from companies, researchers, and practitioners (but apparently kept confidential) serves a useful purpose. It is always helpful to consult this text to get some solid conformation for common traditional uses. Every practitioner and researcher should have this book, though it certainly cannot be used in a vacuum."
1,Most standard computer speakers sound better,"These speakers don't cost much, but they are still very overpriced. For what you pay, you should at least get a small sub, and more then 5 watts rms. My friend has a pair of these speakers and they sound awful. No bass and no highs. There's a little bit of midrange sound, but that's about it. Also, these things are huge. Standard 2.0 computer speakers that you get with any computer purchase are far smaller then these, and most sound better. Save your money and spend a few dollars more on a decent 2.1 system. You'll be glad you did."
5,sharp and brilliant like a knife: her best work to date,"I have loved Lynda Barry's imaginative and yet so-true voice and vision since the 80's. This is possibly the best book I've read in a year. The story is dark and dream-like, much like a David Lynch film told from a child's perspective. In contrast, it isn't bleak, but profound and rich in narrative language with expertly woven prose. Incredibly inspiring to me as an artist to see Lynda Barry grow so dramatically as a writer and a story teller. She has come into her own. Despite its dark content, I didn't want to put this book down. A very moving book."
4,Cruddy,"This book is a great book. I dont read often but this has gotten me reading without wanting to stop. If you are looking for a book that keeps you guessing then this is the one. You will never know what to expect. Roberta, who is just a teenager, has gone through things that no one would ever expect a girl of her age to go through and witness. Overall this is a well written book and has got a great storyline."
3,treasury of Paddington Bear,"While all the Paddington stories are wonderful, an anthology of this size is too large for little ones to cuddle up with. Not enough pictures for little listeners. Single volumes would be a better bet."
4,Very nice,It's a beautiful book. I won't be using it til my Grandson is older. That's all I have to say.
3,Good but incomplete tool,"This strategy guide is helpful but it could be much better. Overall, this is worth using as a tool to help get through Syphon Filter Omega Strain. The level maps are helpful and the alternate methods which are detailed in this guide are fun to explore. There needs to be more emphasis on how to beat the par times and some of the screen pictures are too small to make sense of. I'm glad that I bought this but I wish that it was better. I used this guide and also watched tons of videos on YouTube and I've accomplished all of the single player par times and objectives. Note that there is a multiplayer server running again so you can now accomplish the multiplayer objectives."
5,puhleease,That dude below is a tool! This album rips and the vocals are way more dynamic than rehashed cookie monster growls. Killer band and an equally killer album.
4,"Buzzing, rumbling, hypnotic psychedelia","There are echoes of Pink Floyd in a few tracks' whispery vocals, but Floorian's spacey electric rock has more of a buzzsaw drone than Floyd's most popular material. If you were to reach back to Floyd's pre-""Dark Side"" releases, you'd have a better idea of the never-quite-ambient space rock offered here; there's plenty of atmospheric guitar and keyboards, punctuated by the sting of acid-rock leads, and a rhythm section that pokes and prods the music along at a zombie-like pace. Psychically, it's as if an amplifier has been left to hum underneath the players -- warm and consistent, but edgy at the same time. 3-3/4 stars if allowed fractional ratings."
1,What century is it?,"Index cards to organize household chores? You gotta be kidding! What century is this? I don't need to write down ""Change kitty litter"". I KNOW when that needs to be done!Plan 2 hours on one day a week for ""desk day"" (i.e. pay bills, clip coupons)? Please.... I have to keep on top of it everyday, or I will spend 10 hours on it one day a week!And the droning on and on of poems and family problems. I got ZERO out of this book. You will, too."
4,New & Improved SHE System,"I liked the first SHE book and even started a local support group of SHE's. I recently picked up this book and found The Slob Sisters learned some things in the 15 years of experience since they wrote ""Sidetracked Home Executives."" I found the changes they made to the system to be GOOD ONES. I especially liked how they flat out tell you what to put on the cards - I'm a SHE because I have such a hard time making decisions! The fewer decisions I have to personally make, the better. I really liked the section on getting the husband and kids more involved - this is a topic everyone in my SHE support group yearns for answers on! I agree with some of the other reviewers that some of the personal stories got a little long, but overall I think this book offers a better system than the first book. The first book offers more in-depth insight on WHY we are so disorganized, but the system improvements in this book appeal to me."
5,Better than the 1st one,"This is a wonderful film. Walt Disney would be very proud. And I say why can't they do more movies like this!!! Great, cute characters! True Disney!!!The lady below must've hit the closed caption button on her DVD player because there's nothing wrong with this movie."
4,Bambi II,I have not wtached this movie yet I basically bought it for the neices and nephews for Christmas. I am saving it to go in their stockings.
1,Why does everyone like this movie?,"Hi I'm 9 years old, and me and my friends went with my mom and rented Bambi 2 at the store. I wanted to hear about Bambi's two kids. My friends did too. But Bambi 2 is really about baby Bambi all over again. There isnt new deer or new animals anywhere. It just has the same old stuff. I was bored and asked my mom to turn it off so we could have ice cream instead. I can't wait for disney to make a movie about bambi's kids."
1,No different from The Fox and the hound 2.,"Not a sequal. Just a special. Stuff that went on between the first film. A sequel is events that happen AFTER the first film. Disney is clearly losing ideas if they are making ""sequels"" like this."
