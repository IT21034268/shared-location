3,Smaller than description,"This leather brief pack looks good and sleek. It was not the size was described on the site, we had to return it as it did not meet our needs at a smaller size."
5,more parts,"it never occurred to me the things that young children might think of some of our sayings. especially those that refer to body parts.would you really like to ""lose your head""? this book is hilarious. i enjoyed it as much as my grandkids( ages 10,6, 4&3)."
5,Great for non-literal language,I love this book for teaching. It's witty & great for discussing non-literal language. I look forward to reading the 3rd book in the series.
2,IV's and Vomit....not my idea of easing a child's fear.,"I ordered this book for my 4 year old but decided not to read it to her. I don't know why the author talks about an IV. My daughter's tubes didn't even require an IV, and if so, they place it once the child is under anesthesia, so they don't even know about it. Another part I didn't like was when they show the little boy actually throwing up when he's recovering. Again, doesn't happen most of the time, and even if it did, what child wants to look forward to that, especially with an actual picture of vomit coming out of the child's mouth? I found that very unnecessary. I chose not to read this book to my daughter before her surgery so she wouldn't get scared of those things."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,I'll keep this short and to the point. This is in the top 10 as far as worst performances I've seen. The audio quality is terrible. If I had to guess I'd say the singer is a long ways from being chemical free during this show. Save your money.
1,Nothing but zionist propaganda,"This is pure zionist propaganda; nothing more. The ""Save Dafur"" campaign is likewise a zionist ploy. Do your homework - dig deep."
1,Dressed-up isolationism,"Just another adrenalin junky with a death wish stuffed into a Christ complex. Out to save the world and soak up some highly publicized ""me"" time. And what is this about stopping genocide from ever happening again? True, we could have gotten off our backsides and actually done something to put an end to the ethnic cleansing that continues in Darfur, but stopping the possibility? Is he talking about a police state? How is living in a police state going to help the victims' frame of mind? You need to go in and kill the peeps in power, and a volunteer relief fund will get you there in about 7,000 light years. Then there's the barely mentioned fact that the United States is actually helping to fund this genocide. Think about that one, pimply, puss-filled McDonald's slaves."
5,Gruesome but amazing.,"This documentary really does a great job bringing home just how horrific the atrocities in the Sudan are. I've seen a lot of photos and videos of Darfur but the stuff in this just blew me away. I like to think I have a strong stomach (I almost never feel sick during any movies) but some of the stuff in this literally made me nauseous--however, that's a testament to how powerfully shot and made this documentary is. They weren't afraid to show the raw truth of what is occurring, and that's what made this film so moving and incredible. I definitely would recommend it to any and all, whether you believe yourself to be informed or compassionate about the genocide occurring in the Sudan or not--if you were not either or neither of those things before watching this, you will be after."
4,Good Account,"We all hear about the Sudan, but this award winning film really shows a first person experience, some very graphic, about exactly what goes on, went on, in the Sudan. It really earned those awards."
3,Audible hum from the unit,"Purchased this unit recently from another vendor. When powered on it emits a low frequency hum even when no load is connected. Hum is heard only when the room is quiet, but can be irritating for folks that like a quiet room.Otherwise, the unit looks solidly built, sleek but heavy."
1,One Of The Worst Books I've Ever Read,"I read this book three years ago. It was the first and last book I read by this author. I read many thriller books and quite honestly, I'm pretty easy to please. In fact, this is about the only Thriller book that I didn't enjoy at all in the last 5 years. This is my first review and I'm writing it because I don't want people see the 5 star reviews and waste their time with this book. It's truly awful. It started off okay and then the characters and the plot take a horrible nosedive. I've never felt so cheated out of my time."
2,I was glad this book was given to me.,"I was very disappointed with this book. I had heard of this author from friends. Someone gave me a copy of Dead Eyes, and I must say that of all the crime-type novels I have read, this was one of the worse. There was not much in the way of character development. It was boring. Yes, I was surprised at the end, but getting there was not very exciting or suspenseful. I don't think I'll be reading anymore of his books. It's back to Patricia Cornwell for me!"
1,So not worth the money!!,I bought these for use on my cake pops & just like other reviewers it doesnt work :( Really wish I'd seen the reviews before purchasing at a local store :(
1,These don't write on candy melt,"I made a batch of Lego minifigure heads for my son's birthday, made sure the candy melt was very dry (overnight), and the markers would not write on the candy melt. My son and I are very disappointed."
1,Do Not Buy,"I purchased this without reading reviews first. I wanted to use them for cake pop decorating, but they didn't work at all. I had the same problem as others reviewers. The pens didn't write and seemed dried out. So disappointing."
1,Sooooo BAD!,"My sister and I were making eye ball cake pops for her daughters Halloween party at school.She bought these edible markers from a cake decorating store, along with the other supplies.These pens are so bad.They don't write well on the candy melts.We had to try our best with them and the Betty Crocker markers,which didn't do the job right either.Talk about disappointment!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought these hoping to add an extra cute factor to my cake pops. No such luck. I could not get them to write on the candy coating enough to even tell I had worked so hard. After a couple minutes (maybe less), they would just dig into the coating and not write at all. I thought it might just be one but it was every color in the box. They were not dried out, they just really will not write on food. Use your money wisely and purchase another brand."
3,"Great instructor, author less so","Louis is probably one of the best combat shotgun instructors there is. I was fortunate enough to take one of those 3 day courses. Like others have pointed out his humor is bone dry, sort of like what you expect from Brits but Louis comes from South Africa. The book is interesting to some extent as he clears up a lot of myths and misconceptions about shooting (handguns). Do not buy this book if you want a how-to, step by step book on how to shoot or on how to shoot better. Its just not written that way. If fact those that already have a fair amount of experience will benefit the most."
1,This table is a piece of junk,"The first table delivered was missing the assembly instructions and all the bolts. After 4 phone calls with Amazon, it turned out we couldn't just get the parts, we had to send back the table and get a replacement. We just got the replacement table delivered. All the parts were there EXCEPT now the base of the table is 2.5"" narrower than the holes on the tabletop to put it into.Because it was such a hassle to return the first one, my husband, son and the local hardware people ""macgivered"" nuts and bolts to put the table together.Don't bother with this one."
5,We've been using these for a month and love them!,The pans clean amazingly well. We use the soft side of a sponge with hot soapy water to clean them. Even cooked eggs and burnt rice and it cleaned up perfectly fine. When we used the scratchy part of the sponge it scratched it a little bit and so we started using the softer side and since then they've been perfect.
2,"A year later, already flaking","For the first few months, I was really happy with this purchase. About two months ago, I started noticing that the pot we use for sauces had little flecks on the bottom. Upon closer inspection, it was actually the black non-stick coating which had flaked off-- exposing the silver of the pot below. We only have plastic stirring spoons (even though these claim the be resistant to metal utensils) and I imagine it is just use and acidity of the food (tomatoes, onions, etc) causing the erosion of the non-stick layer. I would have expected much much better from this brand and this price point, but so far my verdict is that these cant even withstand a year of medium-level use. Already looking for new ones, so I don't have to worry about the coating flaking off into my food."
1,Expected a lot more from Cuisinart,"I bought this set about 10 months ago at Bed Bath and Beyond and am regretting it.And although I am not a heavy user of my kitchen and I always use plastic, silicon or wooden utensils with this set, the 'super fancy' non-sticky surface is already coming off from the bottom of one of the pieces. The others are also showing signs of wear. I also always handwashed them as the manufacturer says, what also meant extra work for me.Based on the price, I honestly expected more quality from Cuisinart products, and reading some other reviews on Cuisinart cookware, I think quality has been an issue for them lately."
3,product support stinks.,Purchased set when it was deal of the day. The lid for the 4 quart saute pan shattered while cooking two weeks later. Sent email to customer support and they sent replacement lid but was wrong size. Sent them email informing then of their error. They called a week later even when they claim they would call back within 3 business days. They tell me that they can't replace with same lid because they have no replacement lid for that size. They will give me a stainless lid but only after I return the replacement lid they sent me. It just seems ridiculous that they can't replace item with like item.
2,Generally a waste of time,"I did manage to finish ""Among the Missing,"" but with very little excitement as I read it. The characters are uninteresting and badly developed, the plot is awkwardly laid out in many places, and there was never any real sense of menace or suspense associated with the killer until near the end, when it's way too late. This novel also reinforces something I've observed to be true in the past: that it's always a bad sign when a book has a positive blurb quote from Stephen King on the cover (as this one does). I've enjoyed many of King's own works, but have also tried several books with his quotes on them in the past - and they've all been terrible! So a King blurb will be useful for me in the future -- if I see a quote from him on another author's book, whatever his quote says, to me it will mean ""Put this book down immediately and walk away."""
3,a missing view,"i read this book in a very quick time, i thought it was enjoyable, but not as good as the other books that i have read,.It is a must read for every Richard Laymon fan."
2,No too good,"This unit is not powerful enough. It many parts that get very hot and can burn you"" dangerious"". It shoots water out for 10 or 15 second before it starts steaming."
3,"OK, but NOT custom fit","Not bad overall quality, but it's NOT a custom made-for-your-vehicle product. I had to spend considerable time custom cutting and drilling the set that was supposed to ""fit"" my truck."
5,Oooooo my gosh the best book I have EVER read!,"This book is a book of vividness; all the characters are beautiful. This story tells of Gorlois, Uther, and other not-so-important characters, but all the same, the backgrounds of each man and woman shows up in your mind while reading, and so this is not only scenery and boring rabble. Of course, the scenery is great too, but the ""rabble"" isn't boring either. I mean, it's kind of like womans' rights; that's the plot, and the main characters play a humongous part in it: the Merlin, Arthur, Gwenhwyfar, Lancelet, and most of all, Morgaine, who was in the main part of the plot. After you read this book, you'll get a lot more information on these people, in a fun fun way.Yes, to that person who wrote all those facts, those are pretty much true, I really actually did a little research on them...And I yeah, to that person you uh... failed a test? It really is sooooo captivating, I was absorbed in the book for 5 hours a day, (after school). ..."
4,Worth the 800 pages,"As a mom of young children, I don't often take on 800+ page books but I bought this one online wihout looking at the page count. I am so glad I did. While it took me almost 2 months to read, I enjoyed every page. It's a wonderful retelling of a story that I thought I knew well. I really liked that it gave it's own unqiue twist and provided a new side by telling it from the view point of the women - much more than the typical story of Guinevere, Arthur and Lancelot. It's starts before Arthur becoming King and continues past the holy grail quest - the full story told in a unique and fanscinating manner. It's wonderfully written and while not a quick page-turner, I highly recommend it."
4,A good read,"I found this to be a good, albeit a bit long and involved, read. Since Arthurian legend is not my area of expertise, I really can't say how accurate it was. However, as a pagan, I am glad to see a book that, for once, puts the pagans in a good light, and shows how most of Christianity has warped the reputation of paganism in general. Ms. Bradley went a little too fae, in my opinion, as far as the more erotic areas of this book go, but all in all it is a good book to read if you're willing to attack 800 pages. Sunwolf"
5,After reading you'll wish there was another 900 pages!,"Mists was one of the best books I've ever read! I definitly recommend it to anyone, whether or not you even care about Arthurian legend. This book is inspiring and interesting."
5,A wonderful book!,"I am quite a Camelot fanatic and loved this book. In all of the versions of the Arthurian legend that I have read, Guinevere has been portrayed as a strong, self-assured woman who is as diplomatic as Arthur; Morgaine has been portrayed as the King's harlot sister, an evil witch. The Gwenhwyfar in The Mists of Avalon, to me, seems a lot more realistic. She is pious and quiet, always wishing to do right by her God and husband. As much as I am a feminist, this was unfortunatly more typical of women in that era. As for Morgaine, I found her quite lovable and find myself understanding how some judgements about her might have been formed. This is an excellent book. It seems like a much more realistic version of the Camelot story and I find myself both loving and hating each of the characters. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves the Arthurian story. This is that and so much more."
2,Definitely overrated,"I can't understand why there are so many positive reviews of this. I began reading this book at the suggestion of a friend. I anticipated stories about the powerful women behind the men of Arthurian legend but instead found it to be more a typical story of the chauvinism of the era. I found myself constantly frustrated with Igraine as she constantly doubted her own powers of ""Sight"" and questioned her own judgement and allowed herself to be pushed in directions she was at first unwilling to go. All right already! She was so wishy-washy as was every other female character and the men were just oafs. Thumbs down."
1,DISAPPOINTMENT FROM A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BOOK,"I read this book a number of years ago based on rave reviews by a number of my friends. I was unable to finish it. I sloggedthrough 3/4ths of it before giving up. It was quite awhile ago so I can't go into too many specifics but i do remember flat,unsympathetic, un-likable characters. The women all seemed to view themselves as victims. Strong women, even if victimizedusually don't have the time to wallow in self pity as these characters seemed to. It all became too irritating & honestly too boringfor me."
4,It makes you want to BELIEVE...,"Eventhough the research behind the story is not close to actual story, I found the story very enjoyable to read for a fantasy book. The characters are very real and detailed. If you like a good fantasy this is the book for you. For all you historians who found the book lack truth, go read a text book."
1,Torture,"It pains me to say it, since I love Marion Zimmer Bradley's other works, but this book is the worst piece of drivel ever written. The plot was paper thin and mainly consisted of people wandering around angsting and rehashing the same arguments over and over. 50 pages could have been cut from this book and no one would notice a thing. This book was utter tripe.If you like Arthurian ledgends, do a search for Diana L. Paxon instead. Her Hallowed Isle series does the myths a lot more justice, and is a quicker more exciting read."
5,The best book I've read in ages,This book potrayes women as heros and like all of her books is extremly correct. READ IT! You won't be able to put it down.
5,I loved this book,"I absolutely loved this book. Although this book is very long, I found myself unable to put it down. There are certain parts where the plot seems to get tireing, but read on, it is all important for completely understanding the story.This book is even more exciting if you read all in the series: Forest house, Lady of Avalon & Priestess of Avalon. Those books actually precede this one."
5,READ THIS BOOK BEFORE YOU DIE,"I lent this book to a friend once, and he never returned it. The fact that a guy kept this book shows how good it is. Some readers may be troubled by the sheer mass of this masterpiece. Don't be - it reads incredibly fast. The characters incredibly well-written, complex, believeable, relateable, and three-dimensional. It amazes me a little that this book would be included in the young adults section, as I remember trying to read it when I was a ""young adult"" and put it down because of some of the adult situations. Nevertheless, this is a powerful story.You will hear much about the God v. Goddess/patriarchy v. matriarchy/women as chattle v. female equality themes that run through this book. In my mind, this is a story about tolerance, which is, sadly, a lesson we still need to learn in this day and age. I concur with every other review I've read so far of this novel, that being YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK."
4,"The TRUE story of Camelot (or so, one may want to believe)","While Tennyson and Malory's writing can be seen as a bit archaic and lacking in depth story telling, ""The Mists of Avalon"" is an ""easy read"" and difficult to put down. Although I must admit, it does help to know a little about Arthurian Legends to truly enjoy her ""re-telling"" of the tale. It's told only from the female characters' perspectives, hence the attention to details and feelings. Being someone who is in love with Old England and Arthurian Legends, I would say that Marion Zimmer Bradley incorporates in depth research and a touch of imagination to create (or re-create) this ""historical fantasy""."
2,Well written but upsetting,I got approx. 1/3 of the way through the book and had to put it down. The lies and incest were just a little too much for me. I was also disheartened by the story which I thought would be one of great women. These women while powerful were victims of the goddess. I did not like this book. Although it was very well written.
5,The BEST in Arthurian Legends!!,"This book was the greatest!! Don't listen to the negative reviews. They just can't appreciate a good Arthurian Legend. Bradley's interpretation was great!! For once I was not reading ""Oh Lancelot saved this maiden!"" or ""King Arthur saved that maiden"". The reader would read the story from the womens point of view (mainly Morgaines and Gwynefars). I injoyed every last bit of it and am reading the prequal to the book and the sequal. I hope this helps."
5,"fantastic, magical and spell-binding","Marion Zimmer Bradley's ""The Mists of Avalon"" is a fantastic, magical and spell-binging story about a woman named Morgaine who just happens to be the sister of King Arthur. This is one of my favorite versions of the King Arthur legend. It is full of myth and magic, spirituality and power, and struggle and triumph. This story is told from Morgaines point of view who encouraged the king's rise but also schemed for his fall. It is a breathtaking story full of love and turmoil and you'll never put it down. It is on my top ten favorite book list! I love it!"
4,A truely enlightening experience,"Needless to say, this is a solid piece of work by Bradley. However, I would like to point out the more subtle qualities of the novel. Mists of Avalon is a history lesson for Christian readers. Her presentation, through the eyes of those who worshiped the goddess in her many forms, may surprise those who thought they ""knew"" the story of Arthur. Elements of myth invariably surface throughout and can be read as a history lesson in the transition from goddes based religion which once dominated civilization through the emerging dominance of the Judeo-Christian God. Her female characters are strong and her inventiveness breathes new light into an old mythical tale. The down side of the novel is its overly verbose presentation and its unwillingness to surrender to the standard plot of a novel (i.e., it lacks a proper climax and resolution along with ""flow"" problems). However, the novel contains a wealth of information."
3,"Good, but controversial","I have to say that I did love this book. Normally 800 plus pages is too much for me, but I did nothing but read this book for about two days straight. What I didn't like about it was the way it characterized Christianity. I can't tell you about church doctrine during King Arthur's time, but I can tell you that there is a much higher respect for women now than there is in this book. Also, the epilogue was really lame, touchy feely stuff about how the goddess is inside us all. If she had ended at Arthur's death it might have felt more complete then it did. In some ways, this is a great book, but it is so obviously pushing an agenda that it is hard to just enjoy the story."
5,"Terrific with details, flows nicely together.","This book is one of the only Aurthirian books I've read, yet I loved the way it shows a transition from the Old Ways to Christianity. It shows how brutal it was, the fights, the wars. Overall an awesome book!"
5,"Loved it, so I read her precursors (written after ""Mists).","I'm like the way she weaves history into ""Mists,"" so when I found ""The Forest House,"" which talks about the pre-history of The Lady of Avalon and her priestesses, plus ""Lady of Avalon,"" which fills in the blanks in history between ""Forest House"" and ""Mists,"" I jumped on them and devoured both within a week and a half. Read them if you loved ""Mists."""
4,Basically a good book,"This book was good, but I thought her writing was a little weak. She uses the same word over and over, if you don't know what the word pious means by the end you probably didn't read the book very well. The way she said the same thing just worded different was rather annoying by the end. I thought it was good book, the perpective it was from was very interesting, but it was just way to long for what it was."
5,One of my favorite books.,"""Mists"" was a wonderfully written account of the women in King Arthur's life. I enjoyed every minute of it and would read it for a third time! Although some of the characters got on my nerves, (Gwenhwyfar and Lancelet) I think that that's because the book was so well written that Marion Zimmer Bradley WANTED you to get that from the characters. It was obvious to me that she inteded them to be so. I would recommend this book to anyone who LOVES fantasy and/or King Arthur. It is unlike any other Arthurian Fantasy book I have ever read. Five stars doesn't do it justice."
1,It read like a stagnant romance novel,"I really didn't like this book, it was a required summer reading book for my school, and I didn't think it would ever end. It is way too feminist for my taste."
5,wonderful take on old legends!,"I read this for a school assignment, and was expecting feminist drivel, but was pleasantly surprised. This book shows what is usually a man's world from the point of view of the women, yet doesn't complain. It still has everything you expect from a great fantasy novel, but shows it from a more realistic point of view than the romanticized Disneyfied novels you often find. I highly reccommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy or romance."
2,pretty one-dimensional...,"Nothing new here, Marion doesn't add much to this legend, and altogether while readable, lacked a certain je ne sais quoi. Flair perhaps. I recommend Stephen R. Lawhead's Pendragon cycle. This is the critically acclaimed Benchmark of Arthurian fantasy."
5,Best Book I've Ever Read,"I won't spoil the book for any potential readers out here, but I will say one word: masterpiece. This is the crowning glory of Marion's works, and I would go so far as to say that it is the crowning glory of Arthurian literature as well! I was so absorbed in it that I finished it in a week, and it has been my absolutely most favorite book ever since!By the way.. if you're thinking of reading any of the ""Song of Ice & Fire"" books by George R. R. Martin.. rethink yourself and read this series instead.. it is MUCH better and more worth your time!!!"
5,Wonderful and Moving - Loved every minute of it!,"This novel tops my best-loved, most read list. A deep and moving tale of Britain, in the time of King Arthur, when the old religion of the Goddess is being threatened by Christianity. The story follows all the woman in Arthur's life; mother, sister, wife. Although the length and size of the book tend to frighten, once you start, you won't be able to stop!"
5,Spellbinding!! This book was amazing!,It could not have been written any better. At first I thought that I would never finish because it's so thick but it's the fastest book i've ever read. I love the characters in it and how it's written from the womens point of view. It helped me understand these legends which are so very old. I hope to read more by Marion Zimmer Bradley.
1,Makes a nice addition to your fireplace.,"I burned it. This book took me four years to finish and after I finished it I burned it. This book alone has ruined the King Arthur story for me. The entire book is about religion, sex, babies, and menstrual cycles. If you want a deep book to discuss to make yourself sound highbrow this is the one for you. If you just want something to read and enjoy, find something else."
4,Camelot Babylon,"""Mists Of Avalon"" is fun,but I am surprised with all the fuss about it,since it does not deserve to be called ""the best book I ever read&quot...or to be taken seriously enough to discuss historical details.If you are reading it as it is - light entertainment - its hard to resist,in a manner of say,Jackie Collins in Camelot.As bombastic praises from cover declare,its written from ""woman's point of view"" and we have ""magical saga of the women behind King Arthur's trone"" - ha,after reading the book it seems that women have only sex & witchraft on their minds all the time.Its easy to see its appeal for younger readers,since its basically TV soup opera about who slept with who,but readers who expect something deeper would prefer to have their King Arthur taken more seriously.I was curious enough to finish all,but I took it as it is,without pretentions that it's ""magical saga""."
5,Mesmerizing. Women's perspective on a classic tale.,"I LOVED this book. {I hated the tv movie.} I found the book facinating, earthy, and thoroughly absorbing. Historically authentic and culturally intricate, it's a tale of substance and depth.While it's about women, for women, I think men who read it will enjoy it too.I highly recommend it.P.S.- Another book I'd recommend is 'The Glory & the Lightning"" by Taylor Caldwell."
5,This Book Changed My Life,"I first read the Mists of Avalon when I was 10, an impressionable youth. So, I read again about three times since then, and have gotten two friends to read it. I'd only heard the story of King Arthur and his knights told from purely Christian POV, so this was a breath of fresh air. At first, it did seem intimidating, it's a long book, but I went through it in about three weeks. I couldn't put it down. And my afterthoughts were that it was an amazing book, revolutionary."
2,The Mists of Avalon,"This was the worst book I've ever read! It got boring not even half way through! Everything's basically the same thing--love,betrayal, yada yada yada... get to the point! Nothing really exciting ever happens, it's just the same old thing. And when something does happen, it's not like a ""BOOM"", but more like a ""plop"". It's all just a bunch of poop. I felt that I wasted my time reading this."
1,worse than unfortunate,"As a student who had this as a textbook, I can tell you that this is the last book you want to read IF your goal is managing complex systems. In point of fact, this book is nothing less than an ""in-the-box"" approach to identifying that which is out of the box. Can you hackney the hackneyed? Eisner has proven it so...Do not buy this book, even if it is in your syllabus."
5,To all the AB whiners...,"This is an excellent product, and all the Alton Brown whiners need to not worry about the handle so much. You do not have to hold your salt server just to get a pinch of salt, and even so this can one be held/opened with one hand. Besides it is only necessary if you are filming a cooking show...BTW, AB is my man idol (if this is possible!)"
3,where's the spoon?,"Five stars if only it had the spoon! Not a bad salt cellar. The salt stays dry, seems solid enough, looks good on the counter...but where the heck is my spoon? That may seem petty, yet a salt spoon is really the right size for...well...salt. I'm actually back here just to buy a spoon. If I can find one. sigh..."
5,Excellent!,"This is a great salt container. Extremely similar to the one used on Good Eats. It comes with a little tiny spoon that does not keep the lid open if the spoon is in the container. There isn't a hole in the lid or in the glass rim either for the handle of the spoon since it fits nicely inside the glass container itself. That's a great thing, so the lid completely closes on the glass rim."
5,Love it,"I bought this for my wife after she mentioned the one Alton Brown uses on his show. It replaced a covered ceramic dish she used before. She loves it. The flip cover keeps the salt dry and clean. The cover closes completely so nothing can get in. Not much use for the spoon, though."
3,"Huge volume of songs, but CD quality is not so good","Your not going to find a bigger, more comprehensive set of The Ink Spots music out there from what I've seen and there are some great songs on this set that you can't get anywhere else. That said, the quality of these recordings is a mixed bag at best. Some heavy hiss or tiny sound on songs that sound much better on some Ella Fitzgerald CD sets or even on the MCA Ink Spots greatest hits CDs I've heard. Don't be mislead into thinking ORIGINAL RECORDINGS REMASTERED means they did a good job remastering the songs.Still, as I said before, your not likely to find a more comprehensive set of The Ink Spots music on CD anywhere and it's great to hear all these songs, just wish the quality was as good as some of the other offerings out there."
1,The Golden Age of The Ink Spots,I Have never heard so many off the wall songs in my life. It takes quite a few of them to reach 100. Many ugly recordings.
3,Really Smoking,"Really SmokingThis is everything an overblown, Hollywood disaster movie should be. More stars than a room full of generals: Supernovas Paul Newman and Steve McQueen show their grit - without really having to act too much, while white dwarves Richard Chamberlain, Robert Wagner, William Holden, Faye Dunaway and 'ole twinkletoes' Fred Astaire try to escape a fiery fate. Another enjoyable feature is the pre-CG special effects. In light of the WTC disaster, however, itfs difficult to watch this without feeling a little like a morbid voyeur. But isnft that what all disaster movies are about? They make the rest of us feel better off than the poor suckers who couldnft get into the lifeboat or chose the wrong moment to be in a high building."
5,a great time to be had by all if you like these movies,"i just love the disaster movies of the 70's and this is one i really love. sure,most disaster movies are soaps of the highest order but this one is so much fun that you can over look the holes in the plot and the cardboard people that they put in harm's way. mcqueen and newman are both on top of their games and the movie is never dull. the action is the thing here and it has enough action for two movies,so get this one turn off the brain and enjoy a night of action and thrills."
3,4 star movie - but very insufficient DVD,"As someone previously mentioned, this movie is a reminder of the days of the blockbuster shown in a large, single screen theater. It's huge in every way. The cast, most assuredly, is one of the best.Why then did Fox decide to give it such a poor DVD presentation. Outside of the fact that they at least didn't give it the pan-and-scan treatment, this is as poor as any release out there.If ever a movie screamed to be released in a version enhanced for widescreen TV's, this is it. And wouldn't it be wonderful to have some extras concerning the creation of this movie.Oh well...I guess until someone wakes up and releases a decent DVD package, this is all we have. And even it is worth it, as this is what the word ""epic"" is all about."
1,Lost in translation,"Don't waste your time trying to read this poorly translated volume. Unfortunately, the publisher did not help the author or the field of medical geology by putting forth such a poorly translated book. For THE benchmark tome on this topic, see my review of ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL GEOLOGY."
2,Disappointed,"I'm a beginner trying to learn punch needle rug hooking. This book is almost entirely about rug hooking with fabric, not yarn. I'm assuming there must be differences. At any rate, it is not at all what I am looking for, nor does it seem as comprehensive as the other reviews state. The section on hooking techniques does not show how to actually hook anything... rather it indicates how to go around corners and various shapes. I intend to return this book and try another."
5,"Definitely ""Tradition in the Making""","An excellent primitive resource. Provides tips and patterns for a variety of primitive projects. ""How to""s were helpful and straight forward. An excellent addition to any hooker's library!"
5,Helpful Know-how for Beginners,"What a great book! I'm new to rug-hooking and found this informational book extremely helpful. From the history of rug-hooking to wool dying to finishing your edges, this book covers it all and it even gives you patterns of the beautiful projects you can do! Excellent instructional book and I would highly recommend it!"
2,Not exemplary work,As a college graduate with a degree in economics i bought this book with gusto and enthusiasm. It was a sad mistake because I felt let down by the quality of the writing. Soros explains that he is an expert on the subject and able-minded to write such a book because he has sympathy for the future of the world. I believe that is his only qualification in that this book lacks any reason behind the statements. Soros makes blatant remarks about US and World institutions without ever providing an example to back it. I was mostly interested in his SDR's topic but then found that he glazed over it and never fully explained what he expects them to help. Quite disappointing. He lacks basic essay writing skills although I am sure some of his other books are up to the standard.
2,"Disappointing - Drearily boring ""inspirational"" piece","I am a fan of George Soros, who I consider one of the great original social and economic thinkers of our time. This book, however, has the appearance of having been ghost written by an academic hack who was desperate to move on to some other(in his opinion) more important project.The constant footnotes (almost every page) are irritating and should have been collected in the back -- possibly revealing just how little substance there is to the book.Supposedly this is an inspirational book. It could and should have been. The issues are important. However only the most dedicated will slog through the deadly dreary writing. And having done so they will wonder why they bothered except as an exercise in self-discipline."
2,No longer like to use Bluetooth for anything,"It does what you'd expect, I guess, but I found I don't like to use Bluetooth for anything due to glitches inherent in using Bluetooth, including but not limited to interference, not being able to connect easily, getting dropped or disconnected, etc. What I mean is, the item is not defective or problematic, Bluetooth is."
2,Not very aromatic to me,"Sorry, but first, I have to say that I bought this product by accident. I had previously bought the other patchouli soap on Amazon that comes in the brown box with a ribbon before and really, really liked it. So, when I ordered soap again, having used the old one down to a sliver, I somehow clicked the wrong product. Of course, scent is always a personal preference, but to me, this one doesn't have much scent compared to the other, and didn't fit in my loofa/washcloth holder that I use the way the other one did. Also, what scent it did have didn't smell like patchouli or even very pleasant to me,nor did it produce much lather."
4,Unker's Salve,"My cousin recommended that my mom use Unker's on her feet. I ordered it for her. After using it the first night, Mom told me that the salve was greasier than she expected it to be and she wasn't sure that it really eased her foot pain. She is still using Unker's, but I don't know if she'll reorder it."
5,It works,"I've been using Unkers for the last 10 years...It's great. I just plain works on any aches and pains. It promotes healing of wounds and works great on sunburn. I’ve recommended it to relatives, friend and anyone that’s talking about a pain. My son uses it before every soccer game, my brother in law uses’ it to relieve a constant pain in his back and my wife’s aunt uses it for leg pains she has had for years (she’s 86). People in general, laugh at how I always say “You’ve got to try Unkers”."
3,Not the miracle I hoped for after reading the reviews,"I have migraines and neck arthritis so when I read the reviews for this, I had high hopes. It's no different from Icy Hot or mentholated rubs. It feels good, yes, but pain relief does not occur."
1,Mr Brown is indeed a spammer!,"Bertrand E Brown, who can not even choose an original title for his book (Carson McCullers used this title decades ago), repeated the actions described in a previous review and joined the Yahoo Group mailing list of the London Gay Reading Group before sending spam on it to try and promote his book. I have to say that, after having read the synopsis of the book on this site, I can see very little relevance, if any, to the purposes of the group.What I can see however, is a book that seems deeply prejudiced against women and full of mysogenistic cliches...I will certainly not buy this book...."
1,Elegant and Easy: Anything But,"With the title ""Elegant and Easy,"" I figured this would be a very beneficial book to read, since I am building a new home and want a fresh, dramatic look. I was mistaken. They give color numbers, but no idea of what the color actually looks like; the designs are plain sketches without suggestions of substitution. I would have liked to have seen color photos of actual bedroom designs.I was very disappointed with this book."
2,Dead Man's Walk,"The movie was a let down after reading the book. The acting is kind of ""hokey."" In spite of that, the story does seem to hold up and, if you are a Lonesome Dove fan, then I would still recommend this movie as part of the entire series. Dead Man's Walk covers the early years of Woodrow and Gus's time spent as Texas Rangers. In case you are interested, the sequence of books are: Dead Man's Walk, Comanche Moon, Lonesome Dove, Return to Lonesome Dove, and Streets of Laredo."
1,Disaster,"I placed my order for this at the end of November. It was in stock. Found out it wouldn't be shipped when it should have been because it was ""out of stock"", called and complained and suddenly it was available to be shipped. When I got the package, there were no instructions (i had to go to the website and print out a 27 page manual) and parts were missing. It took 3 days to get this thing together. Decided to go buy the parts I needed because I didn't want to deal with the hassel of returng it. The backboard is very flimsy and is already cracked. There isn't any support. This is not worth the money at all. I am very dissapointed in this product and do not recommend purchasing it!!!"
2,"""Evidence"" that isn't","While this relatively expensive book is beautifully printed and illustrated, it presents so-called ""evidence"" for the historicity of Jesus that is very weak. Scholars who have questioned the historicity of Jesus don't usually make it to Professor status, as the book admits. So most ""scholars"" take the historicity of Jesus for granted, and then make up various versions of Jesus of their own, which seems acceptable to the western academic world. I would recommend ""The Jesus Mysteries"" by Timothy Freke to get a startling, yet true picture of the so-called ""historical"" Jesus.Raja Bhat"
4,Well-priced Edition,"I teach British Literature and find the price is right for my students, the book size is a bit too small, and the intoductory and closing notes and essay are very good."
5,"Yes , received Ok","Yes , received Ok bought it for my daughter drama club and she liked it would buy again for her"
2,Out-Dated,Many changes have been made since this map was made in 1992. Names have changed and new things built.
4,Useful Book,"The book deals with very wide aspects of ULSI technologies. It consist of three parts, hierarchically organized from device physics as the bottom level, device building blocks, and circuit building blocks as the high chip and system level. Naturally, the technical area is so wide that even the total pages of more than 700 seem too short. Among the many engineering issues, the editors selected some crucial subjects for each chapters. Although the book is designed for the readers to move from bottom level device physics to chip and system designs, chapters are rather independent. The book is useful for understanding specific technical issues as a reference material rather than a single volume textbook. Chapter 6, The Hot-Carrier Effect, belongs to Part II, Device Building Block. However, the subject is rather related to device physics than the building block. Thus, it is more suitable as the topics of Part I."
1,pitting in first year,My set is a year old and several pans already have severe pitting on the inside bottom. I never used metal utensils or put in the dishwasher. I called customer service and was told it was only a limited warranty and I had to pay to ship it to them and include $7 per pan for return shipping with no guarantee they would even replace them.I definitely would not recommend these.
1,disappointed with cuisinart,THE TEFLON/ANODIZATION PROCESS DIDN'T WORK WELL ON THESE POTS AND PANS. THE EDGES OF THIS COOKWARE IS CHIPPING. I'VE USED THIS COOKWARE VERY LITTLE AND THE EDGES SHOW A GREAT DEAL OF WARE.
1,horrible condition,"I bought these pans after reading the reviews and I am really not happy with the condition of the pans. One of the sauce pans is chipped. Yes, chipped and rusting. the smaller skillet has groves in the coating that are not supposed to be there and the larger pot and fry pan are missing pieces of coating around the edges. It is clearly a flaw in with the manf. I will be returning these for a refund and find something else. I called the Company and asked about the condition of the pans and the CSR told me that there is no way these pans could be in this condition if they were new. I have no idea what they are like to cook in."
3,it's just cheap quality,"This set looks good in the picture but in reality it's just cheap quality. They are very light and their Teflon is almost disappearing after a month of use, I would advise anybody to better spend more in a more reliable brand."
4,"Good Set, Great Pieces, Nice Price","I love all the pieces this set comes with. The non-stick coating is great. I have a large family, so I use these on a daily basis. Glass lids are a must! I only gave four stars because the handles are a little too thin and not balanced well with the weight of the pot. Most have a helper handle on the opposite side, so it's manageable. But if they were rounded, instead of scooped, it would be better. I also wish there were another size in between the 9qt and smaller pans, and that it could be shorter and wider, instead of just tall. All in all, I'm pleased with this set and the price."
5,Cuisinart 66-17 Chef's Classic Nonstick Hard-Anodized 17-Piece Cookware Set,"What can you say about an item like this Cuisinart 66-17 Chef's Classic Nonstick Hard-Anodized 17-Piece Cookware Set, it performs quite well."
4,Cook like the pros for a fraction of the price!!,"I have been using this set for almost 3 weeks now. I'm very impressed with the non-stick features of this cookware. I've made several recipes and so far, not a thing has stuck to these pans. Machine dishwashing is not recommended for this set, which isn't an issue for me, but it's something to consider if you hate washing dishes by hand. The handles of this cookware do not get hot, but I've found since they're a lighter weight aluminum compared to the pan itself, it can be somewhat of a balancing act to move a filled pot. Overall, I'd definitely purchase this set again. It's a large collection of very useful sizes and the overall quality cannot be beat for the price."
4,promising,I just opened the box of cookware today. It looks wonderful is heavy and the little skillet cooked my hamburger quickly and on a lower temperture than my old cookware. It also washed up nicely. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I haven't given it a full try yet.
5,LOVE Yogi's First Christmas!,"Trust me in that I haven't been a 'kid' for many years, but I still love ""Yogi's First Christmas""! There's nothing I'd rather have on while I'm doing holiday decorating or baking. Both copies I ordered (one for me, one for my daughter) arrived before the estimated arrival date and in PERFECT condition!"
4,Plays great-exactly what we wnated!,"Came wrapped well, have not played the move as it is a gift for someone who has been searching for it for a long time.... here is hoping it plays well, fingers crossedMOVIE PLAYED FANTASTIC -=- was a Christmas gift so didn't get the word that it played great till after Christmas ---"
1,defective,The shoe for the right foot fit fine. The left foot shoe was uncomfortable--there was something inside it (not smooth inside).
3,Don't put comforter in the dryer!,"I recommend hanging the comforter up to dry if you wash it. When I put it in the dryer, some of the stuffing inside hardened on the edge of it for some reason."
3,Sheet Set!? How about just fitted sheet. there was no flat sheet!,It says sheet set here on the site but then when you get the set it comes with everything but the flat sheet. The pkg. also has everything listed on it but the flat sheet.
5,It hates your loved one.,"And so do you so rock on! With real rockers! Who describe your every pain, loss, and false promise. This album is better than girls, so forget about them and buy it. If you hear this album a thousand times it still won't be enough. -Brokenhearted"
5,Never has one album stirred up more emotions,"It's been a few years since Dear You was released, and since the break-up of the band it's one of the most wanted punk/indie albums out there, and unfortunately out of print. I recommend buying everything this San Francisco trio has released, but if you've never heard of them, listen to the endless story of heartbreak, angst and confusion told in Dear You. You will find yourself amazed at the fact that melancholy can sound so good, and won't regret having taken the time to listen not only to the songs as a whole, but to the lyrical and musical components seperately. A MUST in every collection."
1,Does not fit less than 15mm pin watch.,"My small women's watch has 13mm pins, and this isn't even close to being narrow enough. This would fit only 15 to 16mm, not the 12-16mm range that they specify. And if you try to cut the edge off the strip to make it narrower, it instantly unravels completely, rendering it unusable (and I assume unreturnable.)To their credit, it's a nice design, with the strip that goes through the pins being nice and thin, attached to the surface of the wider thicker black webbing strap. Other brand watch straps appear to just thread the whole thick strap between the pins and the watch, which doesn't fit on a small, thin, delicate watch."
3,Very disappointing,"I give this book 5 stars for potential and 1 for execution. My wife and I both read it, both found the first book ""The Family Trade"" very intriguing, loved the main character and the ideas. But since TOR ripped Stross's book in half, the first book basically has no ending.So on to the second book. Lots of great ideas and storylines, but again, we felt the hand of TOR... there were WAY more storylines here than Stross could manage, and a lot of our favorite elements of the story got buried under unnecessary complications and characters that suddenly pop in from nowhere. I know this is probably an excuse to have another book in the series, but I felt like Stross didn't even TRY to have a satisfying ending. Doesn't make me want to read any of his other work. Too bad!"
5,Awesome Collection,"Have always been a Tim Burton fan, and this set does not disappoint. It is a great collection of films and the included booklet with information/pictures about the production of the films is nice. Enjoyed adding this to my Blu-Ray collection!"
2,Italian and English,6 DVDs but 3 film. I thought that they were 6 film and I didn't know that it was sent from Italia.
5,Tim Burton Collection,"When I first saw this was coming out I new I had to get it. I love Tim Burton movies, but I don't actually have very many of them and the movies that I do have are not in this collection. If you like Tim Burton you must own this collection."
4,Grado SR80i,"Good sound quality, especially for the price. Max volume is ok. As a person who wears glasses however, after prolonged wear of these headphones you feel a pinch behind your ears where your glasses end. A few hours into wearing these headphones and I have to take them off for a break. Other than that, good product."
4,"Great sound, comfortable on the ears","My Bose headphones were deteriorating around the ear form (common problem with the brand) so it was time to look into a new headphones. After reading extensive reviews I decided to try the Grado Series SR80i. As soon as I pluged them into my PC I knew I made the right choice. The sound is amazing, the clarity, lows, highs, bass are all top! This is my first headphone with open ear cushions, I was tired of the closed ear phones and am completely pleased with the sound. As stated in other reviews there is sound leakage but the sound you hear is full force.My only con about the Grado is the heavy than average cord. Since I use the phones exclusively for my PC, the cord is comber sum to move around. Thats my only complaint, for the rest I'm very pleased and look forward to many more hours of listening pleasure from these headphones."
3,Creature (dis)comfort defeats all comers,"Mr. Grado has the sound reproduction expertise down to a science. Puts a smile on one's face! Unfortunately, this cannot last long for one sitting because these headphones are soon ~uncomfortable~. The foam rubber padding on the earphones, which should be all but unnoticeable, is stiffly intrusive on the ears after just a few minutes. The leathery vinyl strap across the top of the head has no attempt at padding. It's downright sad that I feel ambivalent when I reach for my new headphones. Note to Grado: no level of quality elsewhere can break through the concrete ceiling set by creature comfort. How about offering a free upgrade parts kit?"
1,falls apart,"I owned a pair of sony's that i bought in 1991 and lasted a decade. A friend turned me onto these Grado Labs and within two weeks it came apart - the headphone fell apart out of the rod. I lay in bed and watch shows with the headphones. I do nothing that should warrent it falling apart like this. Say whatever you want about the sound quality - it means nothing if one of the headphones falls off the rod continuously. It's like a kid manufactured this. I want my money back. If anyone from this company is reading this, please contact me. I want a refund."
5,SR80i Review,"Very lively open sound, good bass, much pleased.AT first foam was somewhat uncomfortable with long wear, bus soon started to conformto my ears. Nice sturdy cord stands up to abuse by grandkids."
2,"Good sound, but they rattle.","My headphones have developed a rattle at 140-150hz at normal listening levels. Apparently Grado headphones are notorious for this. Before you buy these headphones, do a Google search for 'grattle'."
2,"good value, cheaply made","I bought these based on a review I read in a hi-fidelity magazine which touted their value. I would agree that they provide really good sound at a reasonable price. My reaction upon opening the box was that they felt cheaply made. I bought them for my 12 year old son and they broke within the first week - the stem that holds the earcup came apart. If you are careful, they might be fine. Given how they are made, I would not recommend them for children/young adults."
4,Excellent sound!,"This is my first set of high quality headphones and I'm very impressed with the detail that they are capable of producing. I never thought headphones could produce such involved and entrancing sound! Bright highs, powerful bass, and excellent midrange. The earpads are a little uncomfortable, but are getting better over time with break in."
2,Very Poorly Constructed,"The sound is acceptable for the price from audiophile standards. The treble is a bit tilted up and could be smoother. It is clearly not accurate sound. it's more like Hi-Fi. They are seriously uncomfortable and require a break every hour; absolutely terrible. I have had them 2 months and they are broken in. The construction is horrible. The lettering is coming off despite the fact that I handle them with extreme care. Also, unless you are very careful, the earpiece cords will twist since the earpieces stupidly rotate 360 degrees. Also, the factory has an arrogant attitude about solving problems. They say they care, but hey don't respond unless you are spending more money with them. At this price point, I would spend a little more and get a better built product. AKG is one example. More comfort and better construction in their studio monitor headphone."
4,Best cans I've ever had,"I've been eyeing these headphones for quite a while, and a new job in a noisier environment finally pushed me over the proverbial edge. So glad I got these. The sound quality is ridiculous - I'm hearing things I've never heard before in songs I've been listening to for years. They're quite pleasing aesthetically as well.My only complaint is that they can be a bit uncomfortable on the top of my head (something that may be attributed to a lack of foliage up there), but that's a fairly minor complaint and everything else is pure gravy. Would definitely suggest these to anyone looking for high-quality headphones on a budget."
5,first pair of audiophile headphones,overall very good product. love the design. cushions need some getting used to and they feel scratchy sometimes but i'm planning to try out different cushions grado offers to find the best fit. bend the head bands outward a bit if they feel too tight. bass is not that strong but everything else is great. feels very full except for bass but what do you expect for open air headphones? it's an inherent design limitation that the bass is lacking due to open air. overall great sound.
3,"Meh,sticking to earbuds.","I have used SR60i and SR80i. They both have been very fragile. For one pair,the black stubs have popped off,which makes its difficult to adjust them without falling off. Another pair,one side fell off the silver holding for it.It gets 3 stars for its bass,but no different between 60i and 80i."
2,uncomfortable and the ear pads don't last long,"I'm not even going to pretend I'm some kind of audiophile. I mainly use headphones to listen to highly compressed throwaway pop songs while I'm writing computer software at work. I've had the Grado SR80 headphones since around 2000. Since then, I've had to replace the earpads 3 times - and the earpads are not cheap at $20/pair.Additionally, they make your ears sore after wearing them for a long time. It's not like I have especially large ears. The earpads are just uncomfortable and expensive to maintain. They are made of a fairly rigid foam that starts to crumble in 2-3 years.In 2007 I have replaced my SR80 headphones with a pair of Sony MDR-V6 headphones and have not looked back since. They were about the same price, much more comfortable, and much more durable."
5,Unkers away you aches and pains.,"I have used this linament for 20 years, and it is excellent for relief of both muscle pain as well as joint pain due to arthritis. It is hard to find, and I'm glad it's now available online."
4,Good Book,It is a good read for my 3 year old. Pictures are not that great because they like to talk about the pictures
4,A masterful true crime story set in Victorian times.,"Crichton shows his highest writing skill in this story ofa robbery in Victorian times. With details of months ofplanning, carefully staged break-ins (and break-outs), fakedromances and faked deaths, climbing of buildings, and walkingon moving trains, this story would be a huge credit toCrichton's inventiveness, but it's all true. You'll beastounded at the uses made of dead cats, country rats,chimney sweeps and belled coffins, and you'll delight inthe telling of the story in full Victorian slang. By theend, you'll wish you had been there to be a part of it all."
3,The So-So Train Robbery,"Can this really even be considered a novel? It's more like a series of lectures loosely stitched around a historical heist (a great train robbery, it so happens). The plot trickles out in dribs and drabs, frequently interrupted every few paragraphs by gracelessly inserted infodumps that go on for pages. There's zero characterization unless Crichton's repeated descriptions of the protagonist's red beard count (and there follows a mini-lecture on Victorian whisker fashions). The dialogue is nearly indecipherable coz Crichton decided to use every bit of Victorian slang he came across in his research. Victorians didn't even use this much Victorian slang. Much of the book is fairly interesting (if skewed slightly rightwing), it's just not put together very solidly. It reads like something that was researched for months, then slapped together in about a week."
5,WOW!,"It doesn't get any better than this! Not only is this story true, but it has plot twists, imagery and detail that rival any suspense fiction I've ever come across. If you are into historical England and want to learn about the Victorian society while simultaneously engaged in one of the most amazing modern day heists, look no further. A MUST READ."
3,Not His Best,"I am a big fan of Michael Crichton, but this isn't his best work. Everybody has different taste so you may like it. The old English era is probably why I wasn't crazy about it."
5,Works well and is waterproof.,"Ordered this when I put my house on sale by owner. Very sturdy and definitely waterproof. Had a downpour yesterday and my fliers stay nice and dry. Tie wrap included with the box broke when I tried to use it, but that was the only negative."
4,these other reviewers must be crazy...,"This book is precise, and it's comprehensive. It may not take you by the hand and say ""step 1, draw a circle..."" but I don't think this is really a HOW-TO type of book. It's more of a WHY book. It explains to artists the fundamental reasons to use a wide range of specific lighting theories, and it describes these theories very well (Hogarth's explanations work for me, and probably for other people in the worlds of comics, animation, etc.).This book doesn't aim to be your one-and-only reference on the subject of lighting (an extremely technical subject to be sure). It's primary focus is not on color, but on form, and it may not talk about lighting the way that 3D artists do. But I've learned a ton from this book, and I refer to it often."
5,Hogarth Review,"This book is killer.... it starts by talking about silhouettes.... then adding 1 highlight... then more and more form definition...Everything from directional light, to moonlight, to sculptural light.Great for anyone looking to add detail to their line work."
3,A Good Read To Kill A Weekend,"This book is actually somewhat boring but on a cold and rainy weekend I found it a quick and easy read. Bits of humor, some insight into this person who appears to be trying to find herself as age creeps up on her. This book may inspire those who at midlife are looking for a change to go for it, take the gamble."
5,super dictionary,"This is an excellent dictionary, with an excellent cd rom, specially to whose are learning English. However, the paper used do print the text is a bad thing about this dictionary: it is too thin."
5,The best english dictionary I ever had.,This is the best dictionary I ever had. Besides the normal reference I found the usage examples great. I am a native spanish language person and I found it specially useful in my advanced english studies.
1,fake cheap copy,"I hated this product its definately not the real fragance wich I already owned in the past, do not purchase it! it smells like nothing and it goes away after a couple minutes. very dissappointed"
3,Missing parts from manufacturer.,"This service kit was missing the spring (pictured). Not a fault of amazon, as it's packaged by warn. It's the largest component in the kit, sans the pads, and was overlooked. SHAME."
2,Borrow this from a friend,"Kick Snare Hat - four well regarded drummers - should be hot - but it is not - too many interviews not enough drumming. There are a few nice secquences where each player does a Kick Snare Hat solo which I really like BUT they are not marked on the DVD menu and are difficult to find. On the end of the disc is an extended 4 drummer jam - but I didn't find this very musical and the overall effect was too cluttred. This DVD should be edited down to about 30 minutes - none of the interview are interesting, they just talk about how awesome they think each other are and how gospel, NOT HIP HOP, as been on their life"
4,Excellent buy,"This strap is a very worthy replacement for my previous Island Style Velcro strap which I could no longer source. My only caveat is that the plastic buckle is fairly large and you need to get used to it. The Island Style strap had a much smaller, thinner metal buckle which was a pleasure."
2,A bit self serving....,"I purchased this book coupled with another recommended by Amazon.com - DOWNTIME - A GUIDE TO FEDERAL INCARCERATION. Although Mr. Luongo's book had a couple of pieces of good information I found the majority of the informaiton it contained to be a bit self centered. That is not to say that Mr. Luongo's effort was not appreciated but both myself and my family found the information in DOWNTIME significantly better organized, more helpful and a bit less self serving."
4,Wity,"This story is precious and timeless. I laughed and had so much fun reading it. Amelia Bedelia is a riot of a woman. She has a wonderful sense of life. She jumps into whatever she does with a willingness to do as she is told, literally.It's not a long read. You can be done within five minutes. Hilarious to the end. I recommended reading this gem."
4,A staight forward account of a thought provoking story,"Everyone should read this book, but especially for professionals or those who work in a business environment.Barret's account of Larry Mungin's experience is fairly well written, and holds your attention well during the discrimination suit and subsequent appeal. The author is a former roommate of Mungin's, and the writing colored by his respect for him but is presented objectively enough so that this is transparent.Barrett presents very well, though (credit to Mungin's documentation) the subtleties of treatment driven by race in the story. Finally, Barret allows the reader to make his own judgments, based on the events and the clear explanations of the legal profession and the legal system."
1,Unreadable,"I could not make it past page 82 of this fantasy. I remained unmoved by the plight of the little girl in the snowstorm and uninterested in her ""animal friends"". I didn't feel the loyal swordsman's grief as he left his young friend, or his urgency in rushing back to save her life. When the evil mages plotted, all I could think of was Saturday morning cartoons.... and even the dying grampa left my heart-strings un-plucked. Alas, have I grown so heartless that genuine human emotions mean nothing? No, wait... I think it's the book."
4,Interesting and engrossing,"Furey keeps the pace and action moving along in this slightly-better-than-average book. Her writing could be better as far as drawing you into the characters, and the plot is nothing really special, but it's still a good read. I'm surprised other readers gave this such high marks -- after reading Martin's ""A Game of Thrones"", Furey's novel, while still good, pales in comparison. Not bad for a first book, though."
4,Love This Bone!,"I'm Murphy, an almost 2 year old Border Collie who just loves these bones. They last for months and entertain me for hours. They are also great for cleaning my teeth. My mom just says that I have to warn you to be around when your best friend chews these because pieces eventually break off, and if too big, could cause choking. So don't give this to your best friend while your away - it's best as a pacifier when you want to relax with a book or watch TV."
5,Great rock by one of the last heroes,"Richie Scarlet has the perfect mixture of hard rock and blues. His work with former KISS member Ace Frehley was great, and this album is much better! 11 tracks capable of bolwing out the entire NYC, with his graspy and personal voice and one of the most exciting guitar works of the year makes your mind blow away. Highly recomended for die-hard metal rock lovers."
4,Raw guitar power guaranteed to rip through your speakers!,"Great Cd by longtime Ace Frehley rhythm guitarist. Sebastian Bach from Skid Row even makes a vocal appearance on one song!Richie's great raw voice and guitar playing has been one of Rock's best kept secrets. Richie has played with some of the best guitarists of all time including Ace Frehley of Kiss, and Leslie West of Mountain. If you like rock in its rawest form, you owe it to yourself to get this Cd."
1,The usual. . .,"I'm glad I took this book out of the library before I wasted my money on it.The only reason I took this book out was to read Kyoko Mori's story which was about the only good one in the entire book next to ""Hum"" and ""Epiphany"".Most of the stories in here, first off, were structured horribly and were seemingly random, jumping from point to point making the story confusing and unreadable.As for the actual content of 80% of the book - It's all pretty much propaganda. Most of it was ""Please pity me!"" or ""How DARE you pity me!"". The usual whiny politically-correct stuff."
4,Another hot one from Coulter!,"I love Catherine Coulter, and The Sherbrooke Bride is one of her best! Alex is a loveable and believeable heroine, and Douglas is a hunk of the first order. Any fan of romance could not help but love this book."
5,A delightful and lighthearted read!,"This book is and has remained for four years, my favorite of all. The humor is laugh out loud funny and the more touching moments cause your heart to constrict in your chest! Dougless has a superior but harmless veiw of himslelf that causes him to lord his expertise in all areas of his life. You all but feel sorry for him because his monologs are so ridiculous. You can almost see Alex rolling her eyes. Alex on the other hand is quite sure of herself despite her sisters ""throat aching"" beauty. All she wants is a chance to prove she can be a good wife. What follows is undeniably the funniest words ever put on paper! I promise YOU WILL ENJOY!"
5,A favorite,I bought this book to replace the one I wore out. Good story with humour.A English romance. One of my favorite authors. Came in a timely manner.
1,One of the most distasteful romance novels I've ever read,"Don't get me wrong, usually I like Coulter novels, but I found this story to be harsh and the ""hero"" unsympathetic. I read the book once years ago and disliked it. I ran across it in the bookshelves and had forgotten the plot. I re-read it. . .and I still found myself concluding that the misogynist hero was unlikeable. I never got the feeling he deserved the heroine and was unsure as to why she ever forgave him for the way he had treated her. If I were choosing a Catherine Coulter novel that I enjoyed reading, I would avoid the entire ""Bride"" trilogy (which had a tendency to use marital rape as a plot device-- an unfortunate Coulter tendency). My favorite Coulter romance is perhaps ""The Nightengale Legacy,"" and I enjoyed her mystery ""The Maze"" as well."
5,The Sherbrooke Bride,"This is the first Coulter book I read, and I was hooked.The action is fast. The characters keep you wanting to read more.From this book I went on to read the stories of all the Sherbrooke men."
3,IT WAS A GOOD BOOK BUT..............,"I really like Coulter's FBI series better than her historical romance novels. Having bought most of them at a book store going out of business for a cheap price, I'll read them but I wish she'd concentrate on more Sherlock and Savage mysteries."
2,Coulter Historical Romantic Fiction,"After you have read a few of Coulter's romanic fiction novels, they become the very same story over and over again. However, her contemporary mystery plots remain very good."
2,Provided green wire is way too short,"I managed to make it work with my 99 Camry LE yesterday.The installation is tricky and I was lucky I found a magic place in the locking mechanism to hook the steel wire.The provided green wire is way too short. I ended up buying additional wire. The trunk release switch is crappy. It doesn't work most of the time. Fortunately, I hook it up with a relay from my bulldog ke1702 keyless entry. And that works all the time.Also, grounding is important. If the grounding on the trunk lid is not good, route another wire to a factory grounding point on the body.The most difficult part is not electrical but mechanical. There's no standard way to hook the steel wire. I took the locking mechanism out and studied a bit. I found a spot where only a little force and moving distance needed to open it. The spot is on the actual movement which locks the latch and it doesn't interface with the manual trunk release cable and the arm operated by the trunk key."
5,Everyone has neighbors!,"... So in some strange way, I think everyone can relate.Who hasn't had some oddballs live next door or down the street?A must see movie for both Belushi fans and those of us who are always spying on the neighbors..."
3,"Surreal, off-beat, farcical","If you love Belushi and Ackroyd, it's a must see movie. Otherwise, the plot is twisted and surreal, and you probably won't like it much. It truly is a strange, bizzare, play-like script, that I wouldn't think would have broad commercial appeal."
2,Bad Neighbors,"Let me say that ""1941"" is my favorite Spielberg film, so I do love Belushi and Aykryod in the right place and time. But all you need to know about this movie is that Aykroyd, Belushi, and writer Don Novello (Father Guido Sarducci) were so high on...pharmaceuticals... at the time, that Aykroyd and Belushi switched roles at the last minute. I love 'bizarre' but the acts are too random and without foundation or set-up. The dog barking in the locked bedroom? You just can't get into the characters enough to care."
3,What can I say.....,"Well I was really interested in reading some of Rollins's work so I bought Eye Scream. At first I couldn't put the book down and towards the middle I would skip around and now I just pick it up to read a few pages every once in a while. In my opinion I think that Rollins is too repititious in what he is writing and I was finding that he was pretty much saying the same things in different ways. It is an interesting book if you can get past all that. I'm sure one day I will finish it, and I do respect him for his stances on the many issues that does write about in such a raw manner. If you haven't read anything by Rollins before I suggest you do...it will definately bring things to your attention that have never been previously."
2,BEWARE!!!,"Despite the picture showing a Yoda topper on the bubble bath, mine came with R2-D2 topper, not what I wanted!!!! Bubble bath works pretty much like any of them do, but smells kind of chemical. Not at all pleased."
4,Must see for everyone,This film is hilarious. I watched it on new years eve in Denmark when I was an exchange student in 2004. I love it. Been trying to get a version of it here in the states for years.
2,"not the greatest ever, and yet...","Everything said in the other reviews are true. Strangely, however, relying on this weird book with bizarre answer keys and mysterious questions, I still managed to get from scoring 155 to breaking 170 on practice tests.To be honest, I have no idea why it was so helpful, but it was. So if you're looking to get a variety of books (which I would definitely recommend... the fact is, none of these companies really capture the essence of the true LSAT, and the LSAC official books are basically just a collection of tests), it can't hurt to make this one of them."
2,A good value but use it as a supplement,"The questions on this book hardly resemble what are tested on the LSAT. Many of them are poorly written. This book is no substitute for other excellent guides out there and certainly not for the actual PrepTests. However, this book contains so many questions compare to other test prep materials so if you need reading and game practice, you get tons. I think this book contains nearly 3 times more questions than similarly priced books. A good value."
1,"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE don't buy this book!","I bought this book because it was the only one on the shelf and I thought,what could be the difference between this and Kaplan and Prin. Review? Wow was I wrong. This is awful. I was getting nearly half of the LR, half of the AR and half of the RC sections wrong. EVERY TIME! I didn't know what I was doing wrong...Then I read the reviews.This book, in no way, indicates how well you will do on the test. If you own a copy of this, burn it, like I did. Buy anything from Powerscore instead. I burnt this book (literally) and did some practice LSATS. I scored 6 more correct on nearly every section. EVERY ONE!It's tough studying for the LSAT. It can drain your confidence. This book makes you think you're not a smart person and you'll never get into a law school. It's not true. You'll do fine, but toss this book. NOW!"
2,"Great testing strategies, disappointing sample exams","This book provides great strategies for each section of the LSAT. It is very thorough in dissecting different types of problems. However, the sample exams are a big disappointment. They each contain all five multiple-choice sections, including the experimental one, but they don't tell you which one it is. You can't score yourself! After sweating for three hours on a sample exam, it would be nice to know how you scored. The CD doesn't add anything significant either. It contains the same sample tests as the book. Sure, I guess there's the added convenience of having your computer time you, but it still won't score your exam. For some strange reason, the program wouldn't even save my exam, so I can't go back and look at my answers now. If you're going to buy this book, buy it without the CD. You'll save a few bucks."
1,This book sucks!,"This book is not only a waste of money, but more unfortunately, a waste of one's time. The questions are very poorly put together, and often make no sense. By comparison, the series by Kaplan are far better."
1,Do NOT buy this book,"I found this book more confusing than helpful. The test questions were not comparable to those actually on the LSAT. They were more vague and misleading than those questions on the actual test, particularly the logic games. Using poor study materials can really hurt you, so I would spend time working with more beneficial materials than this book. I would recommend Kaplan books instead or just getting the official tests produced by LSAC. Good luck on the test!"
4,Good Book,I bought it as a Christmas gift for my husband. He really enjoyed reading it ans learning how to play his new mah jong set. Thanks!
4,Smells great,I love the smell of this (it may be a little strong for some people) and it seems to work great. I wish the bottle came in larger sizes.
1,Careful,"My husband took the 4oz. All Terrain Herbal Armor spray on a camping trip. He sprayed his feet and legs. Within a short time he was itching and turning red. By the time he made it back home he had blisters from knee to toes and his legs were swollen. We went to the doctor who said he couldn't decide whether it was an allergic reaction or a chemical burn. He called in another doctor to consult. They decided it was both a reaction and a burn. He had to have prednisone and a burn ointment. He now has weeping, draining blisters from knee to toes. He will miss at least three days of work. The company has not responded to my calls or email. The doctor said he was not surprised. I would be very careful if you decide to use this, especially on children. Spot test if you must use the product."
5,Great Package of Films,"Picked this collection up mainly because of the packaging - most of the collections of this type are usually crammed into one of those huge flimsy multi-disc DVD cases. This package has six DVDs with each in its own thin-case. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the discs themselves were single-sided and not double like some of the other packages that I've had experience with. Now about the films themselves - I must admit that I've only watched a few of them so far, but both films were of excellent quality - leastwise given what was probably available for source material. Each disc does come with a ""bonus feature"", which range from photo galleries of movie posters, to an audio recording of a radio play - plus there are trailers and a feature short titled ""About Film Noir"". All-in-all, I'm very happy with the purchase."
2,The Ultimate Film Noir Collection (5 DVD Set),"This would be a great set if good copies of the films were used to make the DVDs, but they weren't. The movies are full of scratches and are very choppy due to missing footage. Very disappointing."
4,acustic aid,great rock by varios artist worth the trouble to find give it a go you wont be disapointed
1,the toy for the hamster,this toy i thought i was going to get the whole gym but yet i only got the one part of the gym. so i will ner buy aff of this again? :( i was very unhappy about this.
2,Not worth it.,It is not 3 inches like it said. More like 2.5 inches very cheap material. You get what you pay I guess.
4,Nice Hub,"Cool looking USB hub, worked well with my iMac. A little pricy, however, but never a problem with anything hooked up to it."
2,"This product doesn't do anything for dry, or color treated hair.","I don't understand why this product has so many good reviews? The product didn't do anything for dry, or color treated hair at all. I've used much better products which is really helps to soften a dry colored hair."
5,An epic tale of an epic body of water,"Absolutely brilliant! This book opened me up to Michener's writings and I have to say, as a lifelong Marylander, it has reinforced my desire to live on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay! Following several families throughout the generations, this book paints a massive mural of a bigger than life period in American history! If you haven't read this book, read it. But be prepared to have a nagging desire to visit this Bay and meander through the backroads of the Eastern Shore. This book draws you into the history of the Shore, without even realizing it! What a blessing it is for me to live a brief bridge crossing from this amazing region of the country...and soon, I will live right in the thick of it!"
5,A wonderful read,"This was a wonderful read from start to finish, one of the most enjoyable books I've read in a while. The scope is magnificent, and it captured me from the opening pages."
4,Book purchase- Chesapeake by Mitchner,"The book was delivered promptly. It was in good condition, as advertised, but the cover was in worse condition than I anticipated. It had beed advertised as having some wear, but I was somewhat surprised at how much. I would probably purchase books from this source again."
2,Disappointed,"I'm a little disappointed with this book. I thought it was going to be recipes for making yogurt, not recipes with yogurt in them. I guess I should have researched it a little more. Hopefully the recipes will be good ones."
3,Too varied. Didn't want cookbook,"I like the book, although it is not exactly what I expected. Would like more chapters invested for different types of nut butter. I'm aware how many things I can do with yogurt. What I wanted was making different types of yogurt, such as soy milk, because I cannot use milk products."
4,Nice Book,"Good recipes and explanations, ideas and how-to. Good companion to my new yogurt making machine."
5,A book of fact and truth,"The book gave me a sense of direction and hope in a world where so much has been lost , I would recommend this book to anyone worthy of taking the chance to find truth where their is erra."
4,an intellectual approach to the modern day indian experience,"the book marks the struggles of modern indians facing the millenium when science is considered diety. I read it with great criticism. my fears were unwarranted as i'd like to enter this entire book into the federal court record to show that science is based on theory and has no greater merit than the last theory. the title can turn some off, but its worth the read when driving through the geographical miracles cited by Deloria.Afraid some may think too boring at the the first chapter and doesn't intrige readers to continue. I 'd rearrange the chapters for the millenium. certainly frybread (food) for thought."
2,Not much more than dialog boxes and help screens,"With few exceptions, this book simply instructs the reader to accept default prompts and reiterates the choices offered by dialog boxes. I suspect the book has two target audiences: 1) small business owners who don't want to know much about SBS and just get it running, and 2) those who need to get it running but also want to learn about the program. For the first group, I suggest you save the time you would spend reading the book and do whatever it is you do to make money and use it to pay an IT professional to install and configure SBS. For the second group, I suggest you buy another book that explains SBS in greater detail."
3,There is a cure for reflux,"I'm sure books like these are helpful. But what works for one won't work for all. When I was suffering and googling everything I could find on the Internet, I was desperate for an answer. My recommendation after all the time and money I spent? See a naturopath. The answer for me didn't lie in books or western medicine. A hypo-allergenic diet, a detox program, and some supplements to rebuild the lining of my gut - and 2 months later I had zero symptoms, was off the purple crack, thin, healthy, feeling great, and able to get pregnant - something I couldn't do while on reflux meds. So I feel your pain and want you to know there's hope!"
5,Great and informative book.,"The thing that I really liked about this book is that it laid out information in compact, consice and easy to understand wording. It wasn't overwritten. The author gives you the information you are looking for. So many books on this subject, that I have been reading, are bogged down with technical medical terminology and jargon that lose the reader within minutes. This is the most interesting way to present this kind of information, in a FAQ style.The other best thing about this book is the recipes. I've tried several and they are most excellent and do not give me heartburn at all.Try as best you can, to get yourself off of caffeine, citric acid drinks, alcohol and carbonated beverages, unluss you want the issues I'm having, where you cannot swallow very well and you want to rip your esophogas apart. Don't ignore those warning signs, or it can turn into worse."
3,Tell Me What to Eat If I Have Acid Reflux,If you really love to cook and have a large food budget...you'll love this book! Not what I was looking for.
3,Has some good basics for the lifestyle,"I've managed reflux on my own for years, but our teenage son was just diagnosed with a peptic ulcer, along with a reminder of acid issues and now reflux. He has to get the whole learning curve, AND we have to make meals for the family. No more red sauce -- at least not for a while.The book is pretty good in giving simple discussions of reflux causes and management (and by extension, ulcer prevention). It's not exhaustive, but it's also not overwhelming. It's something you can browse a little here and a little there. The writer is pretty funny and realistic, I think. That dose of humour and humanity goes a long way.Some of the recipes look really good. Others are for people with their reflux more under control, and definitely not for anyone on Prevacid, for example.We made the tomato-free lasagna today. It needs some tweaking -- and the recipe did not mention anything about cooking time.So I'd say it's a decent beginner's book, but not perfect either."
1,Interesting Idea,"but not very funny. I was somewhat dissapointed with the ""book"", but nevertheless might be for some people but not for me."
3,better as a coster,"working on something similar, i found this book very helpful; for what not to do. yes the quotes are funny, but they're set in these color boxes with wacky colored text, like a failed color study. true, Judith Henry wants to keep the book interesting, and for that all she needs are good pictures. Judith Henry, should read ""Inside the White Cube"" again to remind her of the class strugle that ""high art"" perpetuates. sorry. la lucha continua."
1,Terrible Customer Service,"Terrible customer service. Received deffective jack, gears were slipping. Cequent customer service makes returns so difficult & costly they essentially guarantee no returns. Do not deal with a company that does not stand behind their product."
1,"SO BAD IT'S....WELL, BAD",Anyone who gave this piece of tripe more than one star should not be allowed to vote (or raise children).
5,Read it. Loved it.,Just wanted to say that I read it and loved it. I read the best parts to my wife and we both rolled with laughter. Tried and proven to be enjoyable.
5,An odd comparison I know...,"Like the TV show ""Andy Griffith"", ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is only fully appreciated for all it's truth and beauty, when you have been in a small, 'everybody-knows-everybody' town. An odd comparison I know, but the wonderful book ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a book that I could read many more times, and enjoy it on many different levels. The characters are intricately woven, so when reading, you feel as if you are reading a psycho-analysis of each and every person. Casually mentioned things can turn into important parts of the plot. Every person in the story teaches you something about human nature. An amazing book, that everyone in their right minds will enjoy."
5,Very Confusing and Hard to understand,Since I had to read this for school I just thought of it as just another boring book. It was boring at first but once I got into it I found it intersting. It's one of those books where u think its going to be boring but it ends up being very intersting. So if you enjoyed the book good for you. Those of you who didn't hey I understand
5,I want to see the world through a child's eyes,"An excellent story that portrays life through the eyes of a child!The story revolves around a small town and all the resident's add spice to the story. Some are mysterious,scary, bitchy while others are friendly, generous and helpful.This story is an excellent example of how children view the problems faced by adults with an innocent and non-biased perspective."
4,"Generations, races, Detroit, music","I saw this movie when it was first released. My first contact with modern pop music of the techno/hiphop (or whatever it is calld) era. Having watched the DVD about 12 years later, I was somehow disappointed. The story takes the viewpoint of teenagers and explores their relations among each other and with older generations - not unlike movies in the mold of Rebel Without a Cause. For people who do not belong to that age group this can be a bit boring. Zebrahead is definitely woth watching if you are interested in townscapes. Quite a lot of good, interesting location shooting in Detroit."
4,fantastic,This book was not as good as the first one but it definetly was fantastic.I couldn't put it down.The way she discribes the charactures makes you see how much they have grown.My faveourite characture is Shia because she is a characture made of pure fantisy and is very loveble she would also do anything for her friends.I am currently in the middle of her thired book and that too is very good so far.
4,Comfy chairs,"The chairs are beautiful, sturdy and nice and roomy. However, they are a little lower than I would have liked."
4,Great chairs and side table for the money,I have been looking for a couple of nice lounge chairs and side table for my front porch but didn't want to spend a fortune. I was very pleased with the quality and compared to the prices at Restoration Hardware they are a great value and look amazing. I am looking at ordering more pieces for my courtyard.
5,Great Purchase!!!,"I bought these chairs partially based on the good reviews on Amazon, and the reviews were not wrong. These are AWESOME chairs at a fraction of the cost of the big retailers (C&B, PB, RH, S&H. etc.). There was some uneasiness regarding the cushions(via the reviews), but when they arrived, my worries were put to rest. The chairs are deep and sturdy. The cushions are far better than the Smith and Hawken set I had been looking at at Target. I've Scotch Guarded them recently. They had gotten slightly dirty previously (unlike any off-white fabric), but easily came clean. I figure if they ever get too dirty, the color lends itself well to dying before purchasing replacement cushions. This is an AMAZING deal! Buy them!"
4,Great book,"I really like this book and I definitely recommend it to others who want to learn more about internet mail. The only thing that kept me from giving it a full 5 stars is that it does not include anything regarding Enhanced SMTP (EHLO) which allows for authentication. I had to dig on the web to find out more about how to implement this type of functionality (e.g. RFC-2554). Other than that, the book is great."
3,Great for the thomas music fans,I think this is a great movie for those that like thomas music. I let my two year old watch it and he seems to enjoy it because it still shows the trains and sodor island. It is a good movie for those kids that like music and thomas.
3,Saw them live in NYC........,I saw them live in NYC as the opening act for the Mavericks. I went right out and bought two of their CD's. I thought they were much better than the Mavericks and cannot wait until they come back this way on their next tour. I would definitly recommend these cd's and if it weren't illegal I would make copies for my freinds but I don't want to rot in jail. That's why I can't give my name.
2,This Model cannot fit GE 25825GE3 cordless phone,"I bought a ER-P240 battery for my GE 5.8GHZ cordless phone, but it can not fit in the battery compartment. The package claim that it can use with GE 25825GE3 model, but actually it is too big to fit the GE 25825GE3 handset. The battery for GE 25825GE3 is more slim and thinner, and a little longer than ER-P240.Be careful when you buy this battery for your GE cordless phone."
4,Stylish writing,"Although Terrence Rafferty is obviously indebted to Pauline Kael -- they both share, in addition to a mystifying regard for Brian De Palma, a snappy, conversational style -- his prose is a smoother, and his opinions, while always delivered forthrightly, are a little less kinky than Kael's. I think this is an excellent collection of film criticism and appreciation. The long essay on Renoir's 'Rules of the Game' is first rate, and his overviews of several prominent director's careers are right on the money. Anyone who enjoys Pauline Kael will find much to admire in the writing of Terrence Rafferty. When can we have more of his work, especially the first-rate stuff he's doing for GQ now?"
1,This Rough Magic,This was the worst book I have ever read. It was so full of blood magic that it actually bled. It was gross. I was disappointed with Lackey. Personally I would think that Amazon.com would be better served to make this an adult only book.
3,Poor Plot Great Music,"MGM had some of the most talanted musical stars of all time. This musical proves that with out a doubt. Unfortunately is loses a lot in the plot. It is hard to tell what is going on in this movie. I don't know if it is because it is confusing or boring. The music is great and Ann Sothern's voice is beautiful as always. Lena Horne also adds much to any movie. I love Virginia O'Brien's musical numbers, particularly (Did I Get Stinking At The Club Savoy). It is also humorous the way she chases Alan Mobrey around during (Let's Be Buddies)."
2,It's alright,"It seems like it serves its purpose as a quick reference, but many of the entries are openly biased (i.e., male circumcision). I think anything by the title 'encyclopedia' should be able to deliver information without an agenda."
1,"Doesn't fit 31"" All Terrain","I have normal sized 31x10.5x15 (31"", normal width) all terrain tires on my Jeep and this cover won't fit. It makes it over the front and sides, but doesn't wrap around the back at all. As such, it's too small to cinch and would likely fly off going down the road. I tried the recommended dryer trick to perhaps stretch it out but that failed to do anything. Make sure you have a narrow tire before you think of buying this. Amazon was great about the return."
2,Does what it's meant to do.,"I just needed something to cover up my ugly spare on the jeep. This seemed like a cheap and easy solution. It's fake vinyl and very thin. For the price it's not bad, but it's definitely not a high quality item. The one I got had a 1 inch tear in the fabric already in it right out of the box, so that was disappointing. I am going to return for a refund, but I am not sure it will be worth the trouble for a $15 item. Just understand that for the cheap price, you get a cheaply made item that will easily tear."
2,Good potential,We bought this to put on the infant carrier carseat. It fits Ok on the carrier but hinders you from putting the handle all the way back. I have tried to put this on our swing and the loops aren't long enough to go from one side to the other. Personally I would recommend saving your money.
2,not satisfied,I was very unsatisfied with the color of this chest. On line it looks like a honey wood and the one I received via mail is a very light wood. It does not match my other wood items as it showed it would. So I had to return it and pay for shipping both ways.
2,A little disappointed,"Toy box is too small and not as heavy made as i hoped for, but it was cheap. You get what you pay for I guess..."
1,"missing parts, poor construction","My mother purchased 2 of these toy chests for my kids for Christmas. The natural colored one was nearly impossible to put together because the holes did not line up correctly so that the screws would fit in properly. Then we opened the second (espresso colored) chest to put it together and it is missing all of the screws, hinges, and barrel nuts. Even the website that you go to to order new parts isn't set up correctly. You click the button to go to that page, and it sends you to a place to shop for new products. I had to practically jump through hoops to find the actual place to order the parts. NOt to mention that the espresso colored toy chest lid had several splits in the wood. I would NEVER suggest to ANYONE to order from this company brand."
1,Hoyle Card Games 2007,"Can't upload this game on my computer (Win XP sp2, computer less than 12 months old) and tech support is only listed for 2005 version of game - unsure what to do at this point - can't find a phone number, can't get any help. Would have given zero stars if there was a way to do so."
5,Great gaming,"Great gaming overall with lots of fun options. I didn't care as much about the voices not matching the lip-synching, but I do wish the designers had allowed more variations within the game settings. In a few games if you're used to playing it differently, you're stuck. But overall I love to play... even Go Fish!"
2,A disappointed customer,"I haven't seen this movie in years, and I still remember a great deal. I was disappointed to see some of the scenes were cut from the original movie. I hope that this is not a frequent practice of yours, for this is not a good way to do business."
3,Good and less good,"Worked well for several weeks, then snoring retuned intermittently. You might try to press the ends together so it fits tighter."
1,give this one a pass,"Purchased two books by Asa Hershoff on the recommendation of a Homeopath: Homeopathy for Musculoskeletal Healing & Homeopathic Remedies: A Quick and Easy Guide to Common Disorders and Their Homeopathic TreatmentsExcellent books. Must reads for those involved in homeopathy.Saw Jane Cicchetti's book and decided to toss it in my basket with the other two. A mistake.Jane Cicchetti has no knowledge of classical or medieval history. Her prejudices and sweeping generalities make you sit there and think, ""How did this person ever get published?"""
5,Silica The Forgotten Nutrient,"This is a MUST READ book for every one ! Taking Silica does everything that the book says it does ! Its one of those books that claim so much and you do wonder..... But I,am 60 years old and I have been faithfull taking 4 silica caps a day for 2 years. I have nails as hard as rocks for the first time in my life ! My hair is real hair for the first time in my life! My Skin looks great for my age and I believe that everything else thats mentioned in the book from bones,heart,lung,joints,brain and even cancer is helped by taking silica, the most important missing nutrient! Thank-You Klaus Kaufmann for your great reserch and for writting this great book!!!! I will continue to take silica for the rest of my life!! Sincerely, Carol Eick ... Timbo Arkansas!"
4,Frye Women's Bella-Hi Flower Pull On Boot,"I have owned Frye Boots in the past, and consistant to the Brand, these are very comfortable. I love the leather lining, and the suede outside. I did have an issue with the boot because of packaging. Some of the suede was matted down on the toe and instep of the boot because of that. I was able to brush it out to make them look good. I do enjoy wearing boots, and these are almost the most comfortable ones I own. Anne Klein and Harley Davidson have very good looking comfortable boots as well. I would definitely purchase these boots again."
1,I did not receive said item,"I missed this music so much over the decades. I'm so appreciative that I was able to get it again - this time it's now on my iPod. And bonus to the great tunes, there's even a booklet and great artwork to go with the liner notes; and bonus among the bonus is a Mpeg video of 'Wind Him Up' (recorded live at Montreal). Excellent...great album...great music."
4,"Dynamic, guitar/keyboard rock music from the early 80's",One of the best albums from this time period. Excellent guitar work with heavy guitar/keyboard with strong lead vocals. You won't want this album to end.
3,The Joy of Hungarian Kosher Cooking,"I grew up with Hungarian kosher cooking. My family comes from Kisvarda and Szeredne and Tokaj, and it's an insult to us, and to the martyrs from those places, to say that their cooking was a joke.There's nothing like the smell of a hot goulash cooking on a cold winter day to warm a person, and to lift his/her spirits.I enjoy and continue to enjoy Linda Radke's recipes. I just wish she had included more, such as fluden and g'ribener peas."
1,"Unless you are small chested, this won't work!","I bought this pump when I was pregnant with my first child. After birth, I was up to a DD in size and could NOT get my breast to work with this. I had to manually push and squeeze as much of my breast as I could into it just to get some suction. I would only get an ounce out of BOTH breasts. I ended up using formula about 3 weeks after my son was born.With my next pregnancy, I'll be sure that the part that goes over your breasts can fit large breasts. I am trying to sell this one right now. I bought it because of the great reviews it got in a magazine I was looking at, so I was bummed."
3,"Great-to-have, but wrong color.","This would have been a typical 5 star review for this item. Like most people who buy this I have more than one primary area where I use my computer. I have a Compaq Armada portable and have 2 docking stations....one at home and at work. I needed 1 cradle for each so I bought the second cradle. The 2nd cradle loses 2 stars simply because it was the wrong color. Cradle was gray, while the palm IIIxe and the cradle that came with it, are black. Why? Be advised cradle received may not match your black Palm IIIxe in color."
4,Great picture book,"""May I bring A Friend"" is a great and entertaining picture book for kids 8 and under. The story has a creative and original plot that is presented with a neat rhyme scheme. The story ahs a cheerful mood which is accented by an abundant supply of colorful, neat and creative pictures. Excellent book. I strongly recommend it."
4,The King and Queen have a Zoo over,"May I Bring a Friend by Beatrice Schenk De Regniers is a very cute book that I think would be an excellent book for any child to read or hear. The book starts out with a little boy being invited to go to the king and queens house for tea on Sunday, from the illustrations you can see the boy is very excited about his invitation, however tells the king and the queen he would like to bring a friend. The king and queen tell the little boy that any friend of his is a friend of theirs. I think that this a great lesson to be teaching children of any age. The book shows children that no matter what kind of friends your friends have you should accept them. Another great thing about this book if the use of repetition, which is always a very big plus in children's books"
3,Decent Carpenter,"""Body Bags"" was an anthology type horror film featuring three stories, 2 by John Carpenter and the third by Tobe Hooper. It originally aired on the Showtime movie channel in the early 90s.Carpenter rarely directed TV films due to creative restrictions and the fact it prevented him from using his favored 2.35:1 aspect ratio however since ""Body Bags"" was broadcast on a movie channel, he never had to worry about content (though it was unfortunately filmed with 1.33:1 in mind.)Sadly the DVD is no longer available BUT there is still hope! ""Body Bags"" is now owned by Lions Gate Entertainment and you can write to them and ask that they re-release it on DVD!Here is their address:Lions Gate Entertainment4553 Glencoe Avenue, Suite 200Marina Del Ray, California 90292"
3,Doesn't show fuse diagram,"I bought the book when i got a used Miata without owner's manual. I found it does not specify which fuse works what devices, and that's what I need. Oh well..."
3,Not very good & outdated,The transaction with the seller was excellent but the book is outdated for current sap users.
4,A good book for understanding the international environment and the rules of game in telecom industry.,"Sharn K. Black's Telecommunications Law in the Internet Age is a good book for understanding the international environment and the rules of game in telecom industry. It is also great good for the course I am taking, this book have no detail discussion about spectrum management and regulation. The data about WTO membership alos need further updated."
3,The Pug,"An o.k. book with great pictures. The majority addresses dogs in general, not Pug specific issues, which is what I was looking for...."
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed...the games glitch and have problems on my computer. I also thought these were like Jumpstart World; however, I have found out this is incorect. There's no way to track the child's progress. I used Jumpstart World PreK - Second Grade as an assessment tool for homeschooling. This is just a bunch of games and while it may be educational there's no real motivation for the child to continue like in JS World. Just wasn't what I expected. I wish they had made some note that this is not Jumpstart World...that may have made the whole ""negative"" experience less, because I would have realized that they were just games for kids to play."
2,Tank top,"I got three of these in different colors, because I just needed some basic tank tops for running. Not in love with them; the quality doesn't seem great, and the fabric is kind of stiff and scratchy. I didn't get around to returning them, so I suppose I'll wear them, but I should have just gotten some Gap body tank tops."
5,Best summer shirts ever,I have these in almost every color they make. They look and feel so comfortable and wear well. Perfect with shorts or jeans. Priced right too.Can't go wrong with these tops.
5,Covers all the basics!!!,"I recommend this book to everyone who is interested in learning more about Traditional Wicca. It does a great job of covering all the basics, in a way that is well written and easy to understand. Great for those who are newly seeking or even if you have been at it for a while and are looking for additional knowledge to add to your practice."
3,Wonderful photos but *sigh* SIZE does matter...,"If you're into this sort of erotic photography (as I am, having discovered Batters' work in LEG SHOW magazine -- BTW, God is a woman and Her name is Dian Hanson, say it with me, guys...), then getting a book of pure Batters photography is a must. But read the specs on this paperback book carefully! The book is smaller than a deck of cards. In fact, its pages are about the size of the screen of a PalmPilot.I didn't read the specs very carefully and was hoping for a full-size paperback, not the PostItNote-sized book that I was shipped.Buyer beware!That said, it's the only book I know of [other than his CARUSCA SITTINGS similar paperback] that features all Batters' leg/feet photos, and, as I said up front, if you like his work, you know you sort of need to have this. (Who knows, maybe the palm sizing is useful ;-)"
1,Be careful!,"This product does not work with my base unit at all, even though they are both the same brand. Sales rep was very courteous and stated that it was a defective unit. However, is RCA quality control bad enough to where they get units that absolutely don't work? Very inconvenient for customers. It also seems to me that they have a huge compatability issue w/ base units and extensions from the Amazon reviews I've read. Do your homework and I would advise that anyone looking for a wireless phone jack save up a little more money and buy a better brand."
2,Wireless phone jack,"This is probably a fine product, but I didn't know anything about them and found that I needed the base unit in order to use this remote. I couldn't wait another week or more, so I returned the product and purchased another brand locally. This RCA product was outdated so I couldn't find a matching base...that's the reason for purchasing another brand."
2,Buy at your own risk.,The product compatibilty is difficult to determine with existing Wireless Phone Jacks. I thought I read all the specs before I ordered it and I was still unable to use it. Buy at your own risk.
3,"All the races, no inside information...","First and foremost, I want to say that I am a huge fan of Michael Phelps. He is an amazing athlete and deserves all the credit in the world. I'm not too crazy about this DVD. This DVD basically shows all the races, which are exhilarating, but that's where it ends. The brief 2 minute interviews do not justify calling this DVD an ""Inside Story"". I would have liked to see more of a focus on Michael Phelps' technique. Nope. No close-ups, no slow-mo's, just the race. They do show some slow-motion at the very end of the race, when it was close, but that's it. I would like to see a DVD focusing on Phelps' training, his upbringing, his hometown... stuff like that would be an inside story but you won't find that here. Just the races..."
2,Not Sure about product,I gave this a two star rating because I am not for sure if it's the battery that is dysfunctional or my phone. Honestly my phone could possibly have a malfunction that is keeping it from receiving a charge properly. I am unable to determine.
5,Excellent Reading Material.,"As a lifelong fan on Al Pacino, I purchased this book and could not put it down. It gives you private insight into a very private man and details the trials that he endured to get to where he is now. A must have for any Pacino fan!"
5,Accessible even to members of the laity.,"While law students will undoubtedly get the most mileage out of this title, don't let its target audience scare you off. The text is very clear and eminently readable, making it well-suited for those of us who only need to prepare the occasional contract and small claims case, too. It answered all of my questions and then some."
2,Watered Down,"Although both games share similarities, in my opinion Vampire: The Masquerade was a better role-playig game. What do we get in Requiem? A little bit changed rules, and setting. Did that made the game better? I don't think so, just made a different feeling to it. Obviously, WW needed new products to hit the market so they could make some more $$$. Since it all depends on limits of your imagination, you can still enjoy this game, it may just need some more effort on your part."
4,love it.,i own 3 bubba kegs and love them. fill it with ice and it will stay for 24 hours. i purchased three this christmas as gifts and the recipients were thrilled to get them.only bad thing is you can't put them in the dishwasher (although i have).
1,HATE IT!!!,"This chocolate does not melt right. No matter what I did it wasn't liquified. I tried it on my chocolate fountain, crock pot & boiling water with the chocolate on a separate bowl on top of it & no the water didn't touch the bowl. I even tried adding oil & lard but it still didn't do anything it was really thick. I will never ever buy it again but the taste was good."
4,Really neat!,This toy is really cool for lego fans like me and you;ll especially like it if you're into bionical. This toy comes with 3 really cool knights kingdom cards that you can play with a friend as a card game sort thing. It's not like poke'mon where you need more and more cards to play. You can have just as much fun with just the 3. I have nine and i split them with my sister and we have just as much fun. The down side of legos is if you drop them some pieces might fall off and you need to put it back together. But overall this toy ROCKS!!
3,a Jewish teen comedy,"The writing is good in this movie: geeks and promsare always hard. He's 17 years old a probably has never been on a real date or kissed. This scene looks like a Florida retirement communitywith white cranes walking around.So the young blond who is his car pool acts interested but isn't.One Chinese girl will go but has a boy friend and doesn'twant to be seen with him. He is just clueless about his best friend.I think that maybe Danny is a bit retarded socially for this movie to be popular? He would be more at home in the 30's movie musiche plays with his high school band; they have the score down butnobody seems to really ""get the jive""when they are playing it? I suppose it would have been too much to ask to get a kid who could actually play jazz on a trumpet?Even with all the strikes against it,I liked the movie and it had some really funny moments( Danny's Dad(William H Macy) is a real party animal, ha, ha...)."
4,Excellent off the wall coming of age story,"This movie reminded me quite a lot ofJuno (Single-Disc Edition). The humor was dry and whitty, while not laugh out loud like an Apatow flick, it is funny in an understated way. I liked the lack of raunchiness also, I figured it would be a raunchy romp through prom night, but it wasn't at all. Instead, it was a refreshing look at the anxiety surrounding prom and the dreaded prom night, as well as growing up and coming into ones own.""Bart Got a Room"" also reminded me ofMy Big Fat Greek Wedding. The story lines both featured a family outcast, trying to find his niche. I love family dramas, with the element of comedy, and this did not disappoint.William H. Macy made this movie quite funny. I found myself consistently laughing at the scenes in which he was featured. Anyone who is a fan of his work aught to see this movie."
3,Amusing and quirky little film,"Bart Got a Room runs a mere 72 minutes, so it doesn't overstay it's welcome. It is a nice light and sometimes funny teen comedy about a guy trying to find a date for the prom. It's only PG-13 and doesn't really try anything new or push the envelope by any means, but I found myself enjoying it quite a bit. The acting is good across the board and some scenes were cleverly written. It's worth a rental, just don't expect the next Superbad."
3,Bart got a Room,"Bart Got a Room by William H. Macy, Cheryl Hines, was a cute film about a boy coming of age and dealing with peer pressure. I don't think this was a gut laughing film. It was an OK film that had a great cast and a story-line that got lost in possibly the edit room.I could not recommend this film to someone unless the price drops down low enough for your budget. Then buy it and laugh a little."
3,shave cream,"Shave cream is good, only recieved one can, was told 2....but it is very fragrant as well as makes skin very smooth and soft feeling after shaving legs!"
1,Didn't get what I ordered,"It doesn't do what it claims it does. The cap closes AS it touches the floor, not BEFORE in the air... It makes no sense, since it gets dirty anyways, although it closes... right after....Plus they sent me a totally different pattern than the one I ordered. NOt worth it at all."
2,Very disappointing,"My 8 week old son hates this pacifier. He is constantly spitting it out. The worst part of it is that half the time, it doesn't even close after he's spit it out. I was expecting a lot more from this pacifier."
1,NOT SAFE KEEP-IT-KLEEN,"I thought this product would be great for my 14 month old when I saw another mom had it, so I went out and bougght 5 of them with high hopes.However, within 3 hours my son got injured in his lip when he fell with the Keep-It-Kleen pacifier and began to bleed rapidly with a pool of blood beside him. It was very scary!!! I almosty went to the emergency room, but managed to get the blleding to stop after ten minutes or so...Your child will likely fall down and some point while walking, etc. and if they have the pacifier in their mouth it may cause some extensive damage to the upper, lower lip internally or externally.I contacted the company and they were suppose to send me some information in the mail and to no avail have I received anything from them.Not impressed with the level of concern and curious how many other children will be injured and tramatized from this...Regards,Concerned Mom"
4,Good product.... would be better if edges where softer,"product works most times as mentioned...closes when falls down. This saves the hassle of keeping cases or worrying about keeping it clean. the only issue that i've seen is after sucking on it for a while it forms marks around my son's face. i wish the edges were much rounded/softer so that this does not happen. also, my son has stopped taking it now...that may just my son (does not have to be for all). Over all, a good product."
1,Don't waste your money!,"We purchased a pair of these speakers, and within a month, one stopped working. By the fifth month, the other one died. We took them back and exchanged them. Amazingly, about a month after getting the new speakers, one stopped working. On the bright side, we did get seven months out of the second speaker before a pop and fizzle signaled its quick demise. Sadly, we were past our warranty and RCA has informed us there's nothing they can do. I guess that's only fair, but the poor quality and practically nonexistant duration of this product made it quite a large waste of money."
4,Enjoyable and Meaningful,"I had pretty much written off contemporary fiction, especially Christian contemporary fiction, until I read this novel. It snuck up on me and grabbed not just my mind, but my heart, in a subtle yet profound way. The storyline, the characters, and the dialogue are realistic and relatable, rather than feeling concocted/contrived. The elements of mystery and romance are intriguing but not sensational or sappy. The deeper significance of the story is spiritual, but not preachy. The heavier themes are offset by humor and warmth without being superficial. Like the setting (a small town), it has a slower pace, but it's never dull. Some books are devoured, but this one should be savored."
3,Not her best,"I am a big Robards fan but struggled to finish this one. While there is electric sexual chemisty between the couple, neither is particulary attractive as a human being. Sam is domineering to the point of cruelty, and Lisa is spoiled and much too defensive. I just couldn't make myself care about whether or not true love would conquer all this time."
1,Poor Design,"I have purchased two of these hard drives and have had the same problem with both devices. The connection to the USB port inside the device becomes unsoldered and breaks. I have contacted Archos but they refuse to fix the problem saying that it is not covered by warranty. Although this is the smallest (and nicest looking) portable hard drive I have seen, this design issue makes this item NOT worth the risk of purchasing. I have recently purchased a Firelite portable hard drive... although these are much bulkier, the durability so far has been great."
1,THIS THING SUCKS!,"dont waste your time or money! all these movies suck, boring, terrible script, just EWWW!DONT EVER WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS THING NUH UH!"
2,What's all the fuss about?,"I'm sorry to not jump on the ""Curtains"" bandwagon. Finally watched it on YouTube and it was just okay. There was a total and complete lack of character development. All of the actresses were interchangeable. And though it's usually par for the course, I found this film disturbingly misogynistic. Rape fantasies? Really? And two visits to the casting couch; one with a guy they never even identified. The ice skating scene was cool and the killer was appropriately creepy, but what was with the creepy dolls? It's never explained. Honestly, the ending felt like they ran out of film, mostly because of an endless and boring chase scene. And the mansion? More like a farmhouse, in my opinion. I do believe it deserves its due in a restored version with the original artwork intact. Maybe I will give it another look then."
4,It seems to do the job.,"I bought this to place under a BIC America F12 subwoofer. I did not buy it to improve the sound but rather because I live on the 3rd floor of a wood frame apartment building and I was worried about bothering the downstairs neighbours. I have not had any complaints yet but then I have the volume on the sub turned down well past halfway and I don't turn up the volume on the receiver very high.The Gramma is about 6"" longer than the F12 so I cut off the extra length with a circular saw as I have rather limited space and I wanted to place the F12 close to the wall. The GRAMMA is not particulary attractive and I did not want any of it poking out from underneath the sub.I placed the extra 6"" piece under the Acoustimass module of my Bose Companion 3 that I have connected to my computer and it fits perfectly.I have not listened to the subwoofer without it being on the GRAMMA so I can't say it sounds better or not but I definitely think the Bose sounds better placed on the pad."
4,Nice!,"Got a Gramma for my big outlaw sub that sits on wood floors. No doubt it tightened up the sound allowing if you wish to increase the output of ths sub with less resonate ""boom"" while doing so.Tweeks like these add up and when the bass is more accurate the music sounds better even at lower output levels.These type risers/isolaters are easy to build as a DIY project but what you get for the money is a fit and finish that is very good and the quality of the foam used will do the job and should hold up under the weight.Few things for under $100 will make a big difference and perhaps one should temper their expectations as to what this can and cannot do for you. Its not a $500 bass trap ( I have one and its a wonderful piece BTW) but for the money this is a nice addition.I have 5 subs in my house and they are all getting some kind of riser/Isolation treatment.I gave it 4 stars because few things are really deserving of 5."
3,Solid but overpriced,"I don't have any complaints about the build quality. I have a pair of these and they hold up my 80 pound subwoofers ok. Problem is the pricing. I suppose when there is no direct competition in the sub riser business, you can charge a premium?"
1,Toilet paper anyone???,"This book barely went into the stories of the St. louis gangs, composed of newspaper stories it only barely scratches the life of these people, I was highly dissapointed by the author of this book, maybe it's time the author retires!Mostly the book is just copies of newspaper clippings with no in depth telling of the stories and the pictures of the tombstones was very tacky and totally unnecesary, I can't believe I paid as much as I did for this book, I deffinatly feel cheated by the author!!!"
3,Not Bad,"Not a bad album, it still lacks the humour and creativity found in their earlier releases. ""Sitting In My Room"" and ""The KKK Took My Baby Away"" are the best tracks, while several others are also pretty good with only one or two throwaways. All the same, not their best effort."
3,Queens meets Merseyside?,"Being a long time Ramones fan, I always had a soft spot for this album. I used to call ""Pleasant Dreams"", along with ""End of the Century"" and ""Subterranean Jungle"", the ""Ramones Bubblegum Trilogy"", being the albums that tried to emulate their 60s influences more explicitly. Pleasant Dreams sounds a wee bit too ""sophisticated"" at times (some parts even sound like they had ARRANGEMENTS- Yikes!), but it reeks of british invasion, bubblegum by Buddah/Kama Sutra and the like. Which can't really be a bad thing."
4,Mountain Gentle Touch Tshirt,"The t-shirt is nice, the color was way more gold than it looked online and a bit more rustic but my granddaughter likes it so thats what counts!"
3,like tinted moisturizer but this one too light in color,I ordered a medium but it is very very light in color. The smell and texture is good quality though. Just don't know what shade would work for me. A hit or miss when doing online ordering of makeup type products.
5,It's a great book.,Planar and 3D multibody dynamics techniques are explained in great detail. The book contains all the informations for writing your own computer code.
1,A poor book on Patton,I donated this book to charity after reading only the first 15 pages. I've read several books on General George Patton but this is the only disappointing one.
1,A Dead Battery will kill this charger,"I have two of these chargers. They both worked fine until one of my batteried went bad. The battery killed one charger, and before I figured out what was going on, I tried it on the other and killed that one too."
5,Excellent!,"""Bobby Darin's premiere at the Copa went down in the Copacabana history books ad one of the standouts. Darin received to many wires of congrats that Western Union told him ""you hold the record for telegrams in one night"" - Walter Winchell, New York Mirror.This statement appears on the back of lp ""Darin At The Copa"", and it can not get any better then that. Darin sings lively versons of his hit songs : Mack The Knife, That's All and Some of these days, along with excellent versions of Clementine and Dream Lover.This CD shows the wide range of talent that Darin had extending far beyond singing. He's comedic, charming, and obviously a pleasure giver to those who attended his premeire at the Copacabana. I highly recommend this CD to anyone, Bobby Darin fan or not. Some say that this is not Darin at his best but in my opinion, it does not get much better than this."
5,Darin at the Copa,"I owned an LP ofDarin at the Copain the early sixties. I was broken and I really missed it, but found it on Amazon! You can find anything here! Who would think there'd be a market for these old recordings! I guess I'm not the only one who still likes the old music!"
5,Good basic information well presented.,The author has done a wonderful job of presenting all the basics of good wedding photography in an easy to understand format. Great practical examples and by far the most complete text I have read. Most photography books seem to be a bit light on meaningful content and just give tips this is a start to finish course on shooting a wedding.
4,Well organized guide,"I have bought several books on posing and wedding photography. This is my first covering the most important aspects of the wedding photography business. Although it admits the prevailing tendency of admitting casual, journalistic photos on a wedding album, it still thoroughly explains the conventional wedding photos. It also describes how to deal with the business side of this activity. I consider this book a good very good source for those of us who would like to enter on this field of photography."
5,Costume,Great costume for Halloween I got a lot of compliments and will wear it again with all the matching items
2,Lousy sizing fits poorly,"This is the most poorly sized costume I have ever encountered. The sizing chart is not at all a decent guide; if it were accurate this costume should have been too large for me. I went up 2 sizes so I could layer clothes underneath and it turns out this just barely fit me without the layers. The arm holes are very small in diameter and if you have any sort of muscle tone it will be too tight. The bodice is not true to size, more like 1 1/2 to 2 sizes smaller than the listed garment size. This will not fit tall women unless you are rail thin and have a small bustline. Length is great, material and design is great too. It would be a great costume too bad the sizing is inaccurate."
1,EXPIRED PERFUME*********,"I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT (5 BOTTLES), WITHOUT ORIGINALLY KNOWING THAT THIS PARTICULAR PERFUME BLUE GRASS HAS BEEN OUT OF THE MARKETPLACE SINCE 2004. I FOUND OUT THROUGH MY FRIEND WHO DISTRIBUTED THE LINE THAT THEY STOPPED MAKING THE FRAGRANCE ALL TOGETHER SINCE 2004. IF YOU PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT, YOU ARE BUYING PERFUME THAT IS OLD AND IT DOES NOT SMELL LIKE THE ORIGINAL. IT IS FRAGRANT BUT NOT LIKE THE ORIGINAL BLUE GRASS."
3,NOT BAD,"as compilations go, this one is ok, but as compliations also go, you will find that there are only two or three songs that will have made the purchase worthwhile."
3,One ornament short of a treefull,"This CD has some fun tunes (Rudolph) but most of the tunes just never catch fire. The CD does not live up to the expectations that one might have given the other ""Where Art Thou"" albums. It is not a compilation of known artists; it appears to be a few tunes developed by relatively unknown studio talent."
4,We're a renegade band,"The Ramones first album with Richie behind the drums was somewhat of a ""comeback"" for the band. After three consecutive albums where they attempted (unsuccessfully) to achieve a more ""commercial"" sound, they went to back to the ""classic"" Ramones sound. The result was an album that didn't win the Ramones many new fans, but was loved by most of their old fans. Many of the songs here went on to be considered classics, such as ""Mama's Boy"", ""Too Tough To Die"" and ""Howling at the Moon"". There are a few tracks that are somewhat weak, like ""Planet Earth 1988"" and ""Humankind"". The CD also includes a whopping 12 bonus tracks. What a great deal!"
3,Decent story,"Decent story about a teenage alley cat girl from a intersteller space station who is forced to masquerade as a ""diplo"" (sort of a far-future secret agent type), when she figures out her cohorts in crime intend to murder her and use her body in place of her virtual double, the diplo. So, using her new identity, she is able to get off the space station before she gets killed, and she is then forced to continue the masquerade on a strange planet, where she must ingage in all sorts of adventures in order to get by.Drawbacks to the book are that there is no new SciFi technology introduced, and at times the story gets a bit too corny... especially the ending, which is almost ""Disneyesque""."
5,Daisies Of the Galaxy,"The musical genius E has done it again!The mystery, the guardian angel to freaks with broken hearts. Daisies of the Galaxy is what I call a conclusion to a trilogy of what E has endured as a man in the world today. Some would have seen E as somewhat a misanthropist in Beautiful Freak and Electro-Shock Blues, but in this CD he lashes back at the slap in the face of society today with a humourous and maybe sarcastic tounge.Daisies of the Galaxy is beautiful."
5,so cute!,i got these earrings today and they're even better looking than i thought they'd be! with 3 holes in my ears i'm always looking for filler pieces for my top two holes with a stand out piece in the bottom. these are great! didn't know black could still sparkle like this!
1,Mything Robert Asprin in 1/2 the book,They are getting worse and worse. Obviously an attempt to continue to wring money out of this concept. Written by Nye and approved by Aspin. No wonder it doesn't feel like his original works.
3,Testing the waters,"This book seems to be a test of whether or not Jody Lynn Nye and Robert Asprin can work together. This collection of short stories are a fun read (just like any other ""Myth"" book), but I found that a few of them ended abruptly and seemed to lack a planned arc of how thy were going to get to that ending.My jury's still out on whether or not this Nye/Asprin pairing is a good one. But I'm thrilled to have ""Myth"" books published at a much more rapid pace than I grew up with."
1,Forget these new Myth books,These new Myth books are pure garbage. Readers are better off reading the original series and completly disregard these co-authored pap.
3,"Short, but if you're jonsing it'll cure what ails you.","It's too short to justify the price, but if you are a true myth-head you'll want it. Of course if you're a true myth-head you already have the book. Unfortunately as all of you know MYTH ALLIANCES was postponed to late July 2004. Oddly enough Amazon didn't update this book's description. What's a year I suppose... At least Robert isn't going through another multi year dry spell."
3,"Easy build, just too easy for Intermediate, Advanced or Expert modelers.","Great model!, but I was done in 20 minutes (just assembling the model, not assembling and painting). It is way too easy for an advanced modeler like me. Shipping was great, got free super saver shipping and it came on the estimated date. The Plastic used is pretty strong, considering the box full of unassembled pieces fell down a flight of stairs. Not a single piece was bent or broken. Assembling the model was easy, the only bump I had was when I was trying to piece the hull together while trying to keep the bow plane hinge, stern planes and rudder all aligned at the same time. It took some creative thinking but I managed to get past it. Some nice things about the model was that the rudder could move and that the guns could rotate. I would recommend this product beginner modelers, but not higher level modelers."
3,Expected More out this book,"Being that this is the only service/repair book out on heat pumps reasonably priced there aren't many alternatives so we're stuck. I read it in about an hour - there's not much to it and no helpful tips that made me go ""Wow - what a great idea!"" It could use a chapter on installation and some explanations of the tradeoffs that can be made to optimize heat pump efficiency or operation. I'll give you a tip and I won't charge $30 either. Delay the indoor fan for 30 seconds to give the coil time to heat up so cold air doesn't blow out the vents."
5,"excelente edicion, imperdible desde todo punto de vista!!!!!!!!!!!!","YA CONOCEMOS AL VIEJO JOHNNY... BLUES A DIEZ MIL KM POR HORA...ENARDECIDO TORBELLINO DE NOTAS... INCANDESCENCIA Y ARROGANCIA AL EXTREMO..PERO ESTA COLECCION DE TEMAS SUPERA LO CONOCIDO...MARAVILLOSA IDEA DE LEGACY DE PONER EN NUESTRAS MANOS EL RECITAL EDL ROYAL ALBERT HALL...NO SE PUEDE CREER..AUN HOY, 36 AÑOS DESPUES TE QUEMA LA CABEZA....BLUES DESCONTROLADO Y ARROLLADOR, DERRAPANDO EN UNA CARRETERA SALPICADA DE NOSTALGIA Y CERVEZA BIEN FRIA....BRINDO POR SU LEGADO, POR SU VIGENCIA YESTOS 2 DISCOS QUE TANTO ENESÑAN......."
4,one of Johnny's best,"Johnny Winter unfortunately has only recorded two *great* albums in his career, this and the previous Columbia release 'Johnny Winter'. His first, on Mercury and called 'Progressive Blues Experiment' was badly produced and his playing hadn't reached its peak yet. Everything that came after Second Winter pales by comparison to his two first Columbia albums.I'd give it 5 stars but as someone else has mentioned, some of the songs themselves are weak compositions. Four stars for incredible blues rock playing that has influenced practically every guitarist who has followed Winter.I originally bought this on vinyl when it was first released and it was notorous for being a double LP with only three sides (the 4th side was blank)."
2,It Pains Me,It pains me to give this book a two star. I really tried to like it. The story telling just did not make any sense to me. The dialogue at time did not flow. I still don't understand the nature of the violence that husband imposed. I just did not find it to be a well written book.
2,A difficult Read,This was a difficult read for me because it weaves in and out of stories and characters which I found very difficult to follow and understand. It was a slow read for me and frankly a waste of time.
1,worst book i have ever read in my life,"i had to read corregidora for my english class recently. i dont know what to say. i like books. i really do. but corregidora simply did not appeal to me. it might have been the overly explicit and disturbing sex scenes or the rough, impersonal style, or something else. perhaps i am not the audience this book is geared towards - presumably black adults, but in most circumstances when i read works by authors of different ethnicities and beliefs, it is bearable. i was so upset by corregidora that i threw it under my bed. i dont know what i will do with it. i mean, im sure it has lots to say about the black experience in america and black sexuality. but the way it was done, the style - i find horrendous.i recommend the black album by hamil kureishi for a more enlightening experience."
5,D.Holli Is Da Soul Pastor,"D. Holli's soulful voice brings the women to their knees. Dave is an accomplished artist who deserves to be reconized by many other people. His move to Mowtown Records will push him to the top. He was the great voice in Blackstreet and found himself in music at an young age. He understands the love and hate relationships and has been through some. He's the Ghetto Preacherman. And if you have ever met Mr. D. Holli. himself, he's a very respectful man and loves his fans!!!"
2,Hmmm....,"I bought this CD because I LOVE Baby Do Those Things, but nothing else stood out to me. I've loved his voice ever since 'Before I let you go',and I looked forward to hearing him solo. Now don't get me wrong, I love how he sounds on this album, but I think that if he switched up on his writing/production team he'd have a better album. I'm not saying that I want it to sound more mainstream, because I love when artists have an album that goes against the grain; but I wasn't a fan of Things in the Game..."
4,Awesome drills to develop technique and conditioning,Very applied. Very helpful in developing technique. Also very helpful in developing the strength and conditioning necessary for POSE running.
3,Shamefully skimpy,"Essential? For virtually the same price you can get Rhino's ""Very Best of"" with 16 tracks and a better presentation. Don't let some marketing whiz convince you to add this to your collection. This music is essential, this CD is not."
5,Great picture,This tv has the best picture of any we looked at. It beats Hitachi and Sony hands down.
3,"Great picture, but only for 4 years","We purchased this tv locally and have been very happy with the picture, the sound, the ease of use. Now, 4 short years later, the tv is green and turns off on its own. We had 2 previouse Toshiba's that lasted 16 and 17 years and were a quarter of the price. I would expect the tv to last longer considering what we paid for it."
1,Not happy with test mode linking,"The batteries seem to be lasting about a year. But, most of the time, when I press the test button, only 2 out of the 3 units alarm.I called the maker and was told that during test mode, the OneLink signal is only sent once.But, during an actual CO or Smoke event, the RF OneLink signal will be sent repeatedly, ensuring all other units in the house pick up & repeat the voice message.Any alarm in the basement can't be heard upstairs in the bedrooms.So I HOPE the OneLink near my bed picks up the RF signal from the basement, if something ever goes wrong with the oil burner etc.Maybe the First Alert people will reprogram the Test mode to makethe communications link more robust during testing.Might instill more confidence in alarm reliability.Edit 12/14/2010:Changed to one star today, after finding basement detector insensitive to wood smoke. See comment added today."
5,Bubba,"Excellent service, very good listening, great addition to collection of R&B; music. Delivery was recieved well within the timeline for delivery. Product arrived in great condition.CD is everything I expected and I enjoy it a lot. A must for anyone wanting to collect this genre of music."
4,Lone Wolf,After all these years this series of movies are great. This blu ray edition is not digitally remastered however there is improvement from the DVD Collection that came out in 1990's. For the asking price this is good value.
5,Your collection hasn't even begun....,"...until You have this set. A friend turned me onto this series and I thought to myself ""Lonewolf and Babycart? This is going to be cheesy"" but O'contrare! Instead this is some of the best directing I have ever seen in this genre in addition to the gore factor which should make fans likes me happy who also love horror. Althought the premises of righteous anger has been done many many times before Lonewolf does not expect you to feel bad for him. In fact he doesn't care he just wants bloody revenge on the Shogun and any ninja he meets. There are many references to these movies in pop culture. Any self respecting Kung Fu movie lover will expect you to see it. Go buy it! You'll watch it over and over again."
5,Best w.a.s.p. album to date,"This album Kicks of with a bang with the rockin title track and does not let up until the final chord of ""rosie""is played this is the most consistant W.A.S.P. has recorded even if blackie lawless is the only original member who plays on this album.There are some great covers on this album w.a.s.p.'s version of ""Tie your mother down"" is almost as good as the original queen one.And the cover of ""somebody to love"" is worth the price of the album alone.The ballad ""Breathe"" is also a standout track probably the best ballad they've ever done(excluding forever free!)all in all this is probably the best rock album to come out in the 90's."
4,"Still not black enough, w.a.s.p.","More of a Blackie Lawless solo efort but still worth getting. This can be a good to very good cd depending on which version you get, i was lucky enough to stumble on the 13 track version with ""skinwalker"" but without ""breath"" quite by accident. It is (for me) a much better version than the 10 track version i previously owned. also the bonus track ""one tribe"" is as good as many of the cds standard tracks."
2,Great Album--Sick Re-Issue,"I love this album, but what's up with this re-issue? It's missing the great extra tracks on the 1996 release. Also, this ballad ""Breathe"" replaces the kicking song ""Skinwalker."" If you are able to at all, WASP fans, don't buy this issue--try to find the original. However, it's not an entire waste of money if you cant find the original."
2,CHEESY GAY THRILLER,"This is a low buget movie, an ok storyline. Nothing to write home about. Its alright for watching one time. Wouldnt pay alot for this dvd."
3,Dried chicken WAS STALE,"My cats loved the first two packs, but this came stale. You need to ship only fresh products. The cats still finished it, but were not happy."
4,Good for the money,"Mounted very easily but the hardware is a little flimsy, lights shake on rough roads. Bad glare- should have a shield in front of the bulb since they use H3."
2,"Not quite the ""prince of darkness""","Ozzy Osbourne streamlines his approach to keep up with the emerging trend toward slick, radio-ready metal, but Ultimate Sin is largely unsuccessful, as the performances are flat and uninspired and the material lacks much variety. There are some good moments, including the single ""Shot in the Dark,"" but overall, Ultimate Sin is unable to push past the level of mediocrity."
1,HORRID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I agree with all of the other reviewers in this category, The Ultimate Sin sucked!!! The production, music, lyrics, everything just was way below what Ozzy was capable of. However, at the time, this was a very popular album. Also, the tour was huge. This was Ozzy's glam moment. Gotta remember that this is the type of music folks wanted to hear at the time, including me (sad, I know).Unfortunately, with the exception of No More Tears, all of Ozzy's stuff since Bark at the Moon has sucked!!! Whats up with that? He is still good live, but the new material really lacks."
5,ozzy rules 4 life!!!!!THE GODFATHER OF METAL!!!,metallica ain't nothin to ozzy and they will always be behind ozzy because ozzy is himself and metallica is bunch of punks who don't really like ozzy!i like the old metallica but the new blows ozzy will always rule and metallica won't!!!!!!!
5,Rocks!!,This is Ozzy Osbourne at his best!!I still listen to this album and love it like I did when it was first relesed!!It is a Ozzy Osbourne masterpiece!
3,"Not his best, but still good","This was an album that is better than most rock and roll albums, but wasn't so good for Ozzy. He has had better records than this, like Blizzard of Ozz, or Diary of a Madman. Surprisingly, my favorite track ""Lightning Strikes"" is on this album."
4,No one tackles sibling issues like Rosemary Wells,"Another classic from Rosemary Wells! Here, youngest sibling of four, Morris, is not permitted to play with his older siblings' exciting Christmas presents, and no one wants anything to do with Morris's babyish teddy bear until Morris discovers a magic disappearing bag and everyone wants to play with his toy. Any younger sibling -- or even just a young child who feels powerless sometimes -- will relate. I like how Morris gets to live the fantasy of making his siblings ""disappear"" and getting to play with all their stuff in a gentle, non-violent way. The Christmas aspect of this story makes it extra fun around the holidays, but we read it all year long."
5,Book of Poems for Children,This is a beautiful book. The illustration used with the poems were splendid. The artwork presented by the Metropolitan Museum of Art were simple breathtaking. I would love to visit that museum oneday. This book is perfect for introducing children to all types of poetry.
4,Small but Useful,"Small TV but good color and acceptional resolution. However, take note that to display local channels this will require a digital converter box. Another downside to this product is that it has no AV jack but it is included in the converter box. Overall I am satisfied with this prodct and with this price who can complain."
2,Garage Band-Says it all,"First heard the song 'Message to You' from this Album around 5 years ago on one of our community based FM stations and then forgot about it. Found i'd written the details on a piece of paper. Funny thing time. Purchased the album and to be quite honest a great disappointment. Virtually every track has that feeling of 'sameness' about it. Sounds just like typical teenagers playing their first tune together in a garage! Recording quality was poor, no defined bass lines, mindless chord plunking and the drumming appeared to lack precision. One could almost feel it was recorded on a cassette recorder.All in all a forgettable CD - As i said previously, time does funny things to memories and have no idea why i wrote the details of this album in the first place!I'll stick to Steele Dan.Cheers,Nifty"
4,Good Web Cam.,"For the price, you can't go wrong in buying this WEB CAM.Picture quality is very good. Very USER FRIENDLY, EASY SETUP.I had bought a WEB CAM that I paid twice as much as for this CAMERA, took it back, and kept this one.If you are looking for a mid priced WEB CAM that is easy to use, and set up, don't hesitate in getting this WEB CAM.You won't be disapointed at all !!!!!!"
1,This camera SUCKS,"This camera is HORRIBLE. The image quality is horrible, it's grainy, pixellated, and always blurry no matter how you adjust the circle, it has next to no options, and the color on it always looks bad, again, no matter how you adjust the settings. Overall, I would not reccommend this camera to anyone, it is a COMPLETE waste of money!"
5,Works Like A Charm,"Read many reviews--always seems someone doesn't like something about a particular webcam--so to hell with it!--I went for the cheapest! Glad I did, this one works like a charm!"
4,Logitech Quickcam Review,We are very pleased with this web cam. My husband was out of town on business and this was the perfect little camera to allow us to keep in touch with him.
2,Not Worth The Price,"I bought this cam because if its brandname.. The install is quick, but the quality is poor. I bought a Veo stingray and the quality was alot better. I'd suggest this cam to anyone who's a beginner but if youre looking for good quality pictures go with the Intel Pc Cam Deluxe or the Intel Pc Camera Pro. Or maybe the Logitech Clicksmart510!"
2,Logitech QuickCam Messenger,Poor quality image. Built-in microphone provides poor audio with background feedback noise from speakers. Set-up was not as quick and easy as I expected on my Pentium II.
4,Good value for the price!,"For the price, this is a fantastic set of DPNs. They do have some minor issues -- I think that the points could be a bit sharper, and mine do bend quite easily. However, I've completed a couple of projects on mine, and they've turned out just fine. I'd highly recommend these for the casual knitter who doesn't want to spend a ton of money on needles they're not going to use all the time.The seller also shipped the needles quickly and with good packaging. I would buy from them again."
4,Decent quality for bargain bamboo needles,"If you've tried knitting socks or small hats with steel double-pointed needles, you've probably experienced the frustration of having a needle slip out and clatter to the floor. Bamboo needles are one solution. The slight grip to the wooden surface prevents needle-slip, and the warm texture is nicer to work with than cold steel.The downside to wood needles is the cost. This entire set of bamboo DPNs for one low price seemed too good to be true. On inspection I found that while the quality of the finish isn't quite up to the silky smoothness of Takumi Clover bamboo needles, it comes pretty close. The extra grip would be a plus for slippery fibers like silk, ""soy silk,"" and linen."
2,Too Much Friction/Poor Quality,"Hmmm, One of the #8 needles in this set splintered as soon as I tried to use it! Otherwise, these needles are very poorly finished, they catch on yarns and split them, also the points are too large to be easily slipped into yarn loops. I think these needles might be helpful for beginners who are afraid of dropping stitches, the rough texture makes this almost impossible. Anyone who is accustomed to speed and fluid motions will find their arms aching from these needles. I'm returning these and investing in metal needles."
2,You get what you pay for...,"Pros:Cheap, very nice feel, smooth finish, many different sizes. Did not catch yarn.Cons:Cheap. The tip of one of the smaller ones snapped barely halfway into a project.Bottom line:You get what you pay for. I do not recommend buying this product."
3,needle sizes,"I just got these needles and am a beginning knitter. I don't know if I'll need the really small ones but I ordered them because I needed a size 6,7,and 8 for a couple of projects I'm starting. They were cheap enough to get the whole set since I've never used DPNs, I won't have a lot invested. Unfortunately, my set didn't come with a size 7. It contains a 6, 6.5, and 8. So if you REALLY need the sizes listed, don't count on getting them."
5,Ready to knit some socks???,"These double pointed needles look and feel great!! I am just beginning to learn to knit socks, both starting from the top and starting from the toe. Excitement in just the thought of the fun socks we will be wearing in our family this winter!!"
4,knitting for everyone! Keep your receipt!,"These are a great way to get a bunch of needles for your knitting needs without breaking the bank, a way to get knitting to the masses!I will say, they are not as smooth as other bamboos I've used, they have a bit more resistance. I did have a needle splinter as well, which was annoying halfway through my project, as it snagged the yarn. But I contacted the company (I tried to reach them through Amazon, they didn't get the message, I had saved the receipt and their e-mail is on that, and they responded immediately) and they priority mailed me a new set of the size right away. So make sure you save your receipt!"
5,Great teaching from a great lama,"Ponlop Rinpoche remains a rarity in the pantheon of high Tibetan lamas: one who can teach in idiomatic English. This, combined with his deep understanding of both the Mahamudra and Dzogchen paths, makes it possible for us to have the wonderful teaching he presents in this book. A commentary on a root text called ""The Aspiration of Samantabhadra,"" the book provides a good, clear overview of the complete Dzogchen path. As one who has entered that stream of teaching and practice, I found this book to be incredibly valuable, and will be re-reading it again and again."
1,Worth the buy...,"This is worth the buy, if you ever find yourself discussing worst movies ever made... This one is in my top 2..."
2,Spare Tire Cover- Universal?,"The packaging and sales info online lead me to believe that it would be a great fit for a various selection of tires. My size was right in the middle of the range. The cover is baggy and VERY hard to adjust. Plus, at regular legal driving speeds, the air current fills it up like a balloon. I will be removing it today! I should have saved the box to return it. DO NOT BUY THIS- spend the extra money and get one specifically made for your CAR!"
3,Good but Expensive,The pads work as intended. However the $35 price tag is too high in my opinion ($20 would be about right). I ended up buying a steel sub-woofer stand for $55 that is worth the added cost.
1,Adidas string backpack,"This is our second one because of bball coolness. The strings always have to be reknotted (however, my son just lets them drag) and the one zipper always breaks after a few uses. If it wasn't for cool bball fashion, we would not purchase this."
3,"Looks very nice, but not that much suitable for everyday use!","I purchased this product a few months ago and when it arrived, it looked so nice with no problem. As I started using it I felt like it it not as comfortable as I expected for my everyday use. As long as you carry a few items in it, it is fine but I figured out that I cannot put some of my heavier stuff in it. When it gets a little bit heavy, the straps start to bother my back. Anyway, I still have this and I use it occasionally when I have a few things to carry, otherwise, I use another backpack which is larger and stronger."
1,Not worth your time on Amazon,This was a disappointment. It looked more like a toy than a real kitchen appliance.Returned it.
4,"Heretic, could have been better.","Now I love MA and all but there was not enough songs to satisfy me on the main disc although I do enjoy Sandovals drum solo. The second disc however was loads of fun for me. Being able to hear Petes foot work and the guitar riffs that were drowned out by the vocals gave me a smile.Also hearing Azagthoths killer solos on the bonus disc was great. I wouldnt really suggest this cd to every MA fan, but its worth a few listens."
2,Is This A Joke ??,"This has to be a goof on their fans. I have heard the same riff now on the last three CD's. There are about five songs that are almost identical that are on the last three releases. Listen to track four on the last three releases. Same riff, same beat, same vocal pattern. It is a huge insult how they keep rehashing the same riffs over an over. Avoid this and stop giving them your money. The repeat is so obvious that it has to be a joke for them. No way do they not realize that they are writing the same 5 songs over and over. SAD"
1,Crap,"I like to think I'm one of the biggest fans of hardcore metal. I always thought: The heavier, the better. I still stand behind that. I had heard hype of morbid angel's new cd. I went out and bought it, listened to it once, and wanted to throw it out. it was the biggest waste of money I bought this year. Every song sounded like it took 5 minutes to write and really, it seems like a chore to listen to it. I hate it. I don't think anyone will be dumb enough to buy this off me. Don't waste your money"
2,Lets be honest here.,"This book might be a little better if you know something about PERL. Let me explain my situation, I've setup enough scripts to know enough about UNIX so I'm not a complete idiot. I know the insides and out of HTML, and some javascript.I think this book goes to much into useless commands for a begginer. It starts out with some commands that are utterly useless for a begginer like me. And it starts out by describing 2 scripts and ever part of it, which I don't find useful at all. I would not recommend it to a non-PERL intermediate."
3,Not as accurate as I was expecting,"I've always enjoyed books from the ""Dummies"" series because they tend to be easy to understand and do not overwhelm you with all the technical details that you usually find in the hard to read manuals.This book, however, had quite a few important pieces of information left out and some of the examples in the book did not work. That's not good if you're using this book to learn from. I ended up having to look up some of the information from the internet or other perl books that I have.It's an ok book but be sure to have other books handy, like maybe a reference book to accompany this one and you'll be ok."
5,Grand Tour of the Universe,"Want to know what a supernova, neutron star or black hole is, explained in everyday language? If so then this is the book you are looking for. Simply put, it's the perfect source for easy to understand explanations about all facets of astronomy and astrophysics. Find out how astronomers know the universe is expanding, how they determine how far away other galaxies are, or how a supernova happens. Learn about energy and particle physics, all explained in an intelligent yet easy to understand fashion. Learn about the different states of matter, about energy and Einsteins theory of relativity. Nicely formatted with stunning graphics, I highly recommend this book, especially to those with no background in the sciences who are looking for a simple, easy to understand yet intelligent explanation of science."
3,"Fun serial, but print is no surprize......","Thanks to Serial Squadron for doing what they can with this fun Universal serial. This serial is unusual because of the occasional musical numbers! This is a single flipper disc release. The format is a little strange in that you can only play one chapter at a time....there is no ""play all"" option.The print looks like it has been in a ditch for 50 years. It has a dupey quality with tons of debris and vertical lines on the image. Of course, I've never seen a better print available for this title. As with most Universal serials, this one has fallen into the public domain and I doubt that Universal even has the negative preserved.Despite the quality of the print, this is a fun little serial and I certainly recommend it. Of course, ANYTHING with Mantan Moreland in the cast is worth a look!"
1,"A disappointing followup to ""Battle Creek""","Unlike one of the other reviewers, I couldn't even make it to p. 70 before I put this Wall Street potboiler aside. I was disappointed because I had enjoyed Lasser's ""first"" novel, ""Battle Creek,"" the absorbing story of a semi-pro baseball team in Michigan. The reason I put quotation marks around the word ""first,"" above, is that I suspect this novel actually was Lasser's first and that Knopf decided to publish it in order to capitalize on the favorable buzz for ""Battle Creek."" Like many first novels this one should have stayed in the author's drawer. The characters were nothing more than stereotypes, and the plot was unengaging and virtually incomprehensible to one not familiar with the bond trading business. I'm shocked that an author of the caliber of Richard Russo actually wrote a favorable blurb for this book. Don't let it fool you.Lasser has the ability to write quality fiction. Let's hope he recovers from this debacle to do that again."
1,Not enough height,"This stand is of good quality, but it does NOT lift the front wheel of most sportbikes off the ground. Mine is a Yamaha YZF600, and the stand is useless with it."
3,Nyabinghi Specialist- Count Ossie,"Count Ossie, the first featured performer on this CD, was the principle exponent of Rastafarian drumming, also known as Nyabinghi. ""Sam's Intro"" is from ""Tales of Mozambique,"" which is as much a theater piece as a musical offering. It is a Rasta's own version of African slaves journey to Jamaica. Count Ossie does not appear on the rest of this compilation. He passed from this earth in a tragic car accident in 1976. Wadadah."
3,Relative cost basis?,"It may be early to review this product since I haven't received it yet. However, I find it difficult to accept that the item costs $3.95 but the SHIPPING COSTS is $4.98! Why should the shipping rate be higher than the item purchase? The reason I have continued with this order is to satisfy a 90 year old youngster's childhood memory for her birthday."
4,The best of the memory books that I found,"Because I wanted to give my two children a book of memories for Christmas, I looked at a number of ones found in various bookstores and online. A Mother's Memories to Her Child was the one that covered the topics that I was most interested in sharing with my children, which included my faith and my heritage from my parents. I also wanted to be able to personalize the book for each of my children, which I was able to do with this book (I actually completed two separate books -- one for each of them). My only objection to the book is that it doesn't cover a mother's college education or profession, which are important parts of my life, but I just added that part on my own. Also since I am a widow, I had to make some minor changes to the sections about their father (it would require major revisions for someone who is divorced). Overall though, it is a beautiful book that I enjoyed creating for my children."
4,Works as Advertised,"I have had sensitive teeth for about the last decade. For a long time I brushed with Sensodyne. If I brushed my teeth with anything else, within a couple of days my teeth would start to hurt again. Sensodyne is pretty expensive though and I recently decided that there must be some kind of ""generic"" available. I found this product and a couple others that have the same active ingredient as Sensodyne has, but at a cheaper price. I give this product 4/5 stars because I think Walgreens has a brand that is cheaper. Other than that, it's a great alternative to Sensodyne."
4,"Practical, but nothing great","This is a nice practical book for beginners in real estate management (like myself). There are some good ideas, but nothing that blew me away.It is worth noting that the book is oriented toward buying houses for rent (as opposed to multi-family dwellings). The author is from Oklahoma and talks about buying several houses for $30,000 a piece -- I live in Chicago and we sell parking places for that much. Still, most of the concepts carry over to any kind of property and I would recommend the book."
2,Slow going,"The concept of Carried Away was humorous, but when it came down to the delivery, it was barely amusing. The romance seem to come out of nowhere. Nothing significant bound the the hero and heroine together except a set of circumstances from a will. All of a sudden, though, the hero was fighting his attraction to the heroine. When the heroine ""thought"" (for the sake of getting back at the hero), she often thought about such things as ""skinning him alive,"" or ""turning him into dog food"" or other such physical funnies. I notice the author uses this same thought-pattern with other heroines in other of her books. It's not amusing to me. The book was a disappointment."
2,Rachel Lee undercover,"This book was really disappointing and boring, especially when I was expecting a fast-paced, enjoyable story similar to other books produced recently by Avon. It's written by the Silhouette series author, Rachel Lee. She was good in that set, but her plot, characterizations, and descriptions are just too trite to swallow in these longer novels and not up this ""big girl"" line of books. I ended up skimming the book, disappointed that i had invested the $6 in it.You might want to read books by Susan Andersen or Justine Dare (Justine Davis from the Silhouette line?) -- both write really enjoyable stories for Avon."
2,The zipper ruins it,"I bought these boots in anticipation for the big snow storm and after 1 block the zippers fall down and my feet start to walk out of the shoe. The shoe becomes pretty useless when the snow falls inside! Wish I had gotten the lace up ones, going to return these"
1,Disappointed,I bought these shoes a half size bigger than I normally wear to make sure they were roomy enough. They were still a bit small and the zipper was super flimsy and nearly impossible to zip up or down. I returned the shoes because they were just too much hassle to get on or off. I'm going to try out the laced version of the same boot...a whole size bigger than usual.
4,Full Disclosure,"While I am sure that this product will be a huge hit in our household, we have yet to assemble it. I was not aware that depending on the size of your tree, you may have to buy an additional strap extension for another $11. So, as a word of warning, you'll need to measure your tree first before you order the product. Be prepared to pay more."
2,Spring Swings would be the easiest choice but is CHEAP!!,"I installed this kit and it was fairly straightforward.PROBLEMS: the kit hardware will only allow mounting around a pole and/or a hook; no hook specifications or pole specifications are given. That's for you to experiment with and hope you don't destroy the kids in the process. PROBLEMS: kit is missing parts and I will have to go to the ACE to replace.PROBLEMS: trolley rides pretty slowly - what on earth is the break-in period here.PROBLEMS: all this zinc galvaized stuff is cheap and cheaply made - the cost of the kit is a complete ripoffSOLUTION: the Petzl Tandem Speed trolley (80.00), two wire thimbles of 3/16"" (7.00), Wire Cable Clamps (7.00) Wire cable (1.00/ft) = 140.00 buys quality materials that would make any boyscout proud and it will last."
1,Know what you're getting,"Please read everything. I should have read that the package only contained 6 COOKIES! Between product price and shipping I dished out $30.00 for 6 cookies, I wanted my 91 year old diabetic mother to enjoy some Christmas cookies. Next time I will be more careful."
1,Caused serious constipation,"This is an absolutely awful product. As a diabetic, I was advised by a prominent online Chinese herbal medicine supplier and diagnostician to use this as a supplement to help lower blood sugar. I took it for about 10 days and had problems with constipation for over a month. It did nothing to lower my blood sugar, whatsoever. This stuff is complete garbage."
1,Not worth it,"I am very frustrated by products that do not perform the function they are sold for. A candy melter should NOT overheat your candy. I purchased this to avoid the in and out of the microwave but even at the ""warm"" setting it overheats my dipping chocolate. NOT pleased and would NOT recommend."
2,"A standard, formulaic diet book","This book doesn't quite live up to its title. The skimpy info on the special problems smokers run into with regard to weight management (which most people already know if they've read anything about it in newspapers or in the smoking-related Newsgroups) is heavily padded out with pages and pages of standard fat-content charts and blank charts to fill out as part of the author's ""7+7"" weight program. This gimmicky program essentially states: Eat less fat and exercise.The information on smoking cessation programs is also very dated; Zyban/Wellbutrin are not mentioned, and the nicotine patch seems to have been almost an experimental technique when this book was written. This little book seems like it was cranked out as a quick money-maker--a standard, formulaic diet book with a few cliched statements about smoking thrown in."
2,They are ok.,The floor mats are just ok. They do look good but they are thin and you can get ones just as good and at a better price at you local walmart. I should have just gotten the rubbermaid or something at walmart instead.
3,Too small for grownups,"Nothing wrong with the sling shot, just too small for a full-size human to use comfortably.It's still usable and fun though."
4,Update on previous review,"While I did indeed receive the Monster Cable Banana Connectors in good condition, I have subsequently been contacted by Electro Galaxy regarding the previous review. Shipping fees that I grumbled about should have been taken directly to ElectroGalaxy prior to making a hasty review. Their customer service is excellent, providing personal commuication on products they sell. My complaint was the shipping and handling fees, of which they have provided a partial refund. My complaint should be with UPS, NOT ElectoGalaxy. This review is regarding the product not the vendor, Electro Galaxy. Electro Galaxy is a great company to do business with. However Monster product are a bit pricey and rely on a reputation of 'high-end' audio accessories to market their products."
4,Easy to use but may have trouble when mounting speakers to wall.,"This are easy to put together and to take apart if you need too. Fast hook up to speakers and receiver. As far as sound quality you will not not know the difference buy using these or sliding the wire through the screw down post. One flaw to these is once they are connected to the wire and you put them into the back of your surround speakers, they will not let the speaker lay flat against the wall. It may just be the brand of speakers I have (Onkyo) They do have a recessed, back but it not deep enough. I just ended up sliding the wire through the screw down posts for the speakers being mounted on the wall. Eventually I'll get Spades for the surround speakers."
3,Picture doesn't match the actual product!,"I just got the product today and i was so excited but when I opened it the plug did not look like what it shows on the main picture. The tip of the plug was like a gold mesh metal unlike what it shows. It doesn't fit the banana wall plate I bought here at amazon super tight, it comes out very easily! Overall I was ok with this product."
1,Warped after a few uses,"This griddle was not very heavy duty, and after a few uses, has developed enough of a warp that I can no longer use it on my flat top stove. Might still be OK for a coil stove or a gas stove, but it wobbles too much on a flat top stove. Other than the warping, the pan worked well and cooked relatively evenly."
2,Better griddles are out there.,I bought this to replace an old Wearever griddle that I had used for many years. When the new griddle got hot it bowed up in the middle and all the shortening ran to the edges. This made it very difficult to use without burning some items. I replaced it with a better griddle.
1,Not as advertised!,This product does not come in the original HP product box as pictured. I ordered one and received an expired printhead that is unusable in my DesignJet 130nr. They are not telling you the whole story about this product.
2,No Info,I expected a little information on at least some of the treasures at the Louvre. This was just a little picture book with no background info.
1,Alarm DSL Filter: RJ31,"I ordered one RJ31 DSCL filter. The packing list stated the filter was one RJ31. However, item sent was the more common RJ45 for regular phone lines (different size). I already had RJ45's. Needed RJ31. Needed this item fast. VERY DISAPPOINTED that wrong product was delivered."
3,Where is white?,"Good product, fast shipping, however my daughter finds that it is not convenient of missing color white becaure she need light color in her work like light green or light pink but missing white..."
2,eh......,"After hearing many times that this is Karen Robards' best contemporary, I had to read it... and was pretty disappointed. It wasn't awful, but definitely did not live up to the hype. The story was unbelievable, the suspense was stupid, in general the characters just didn't seem to pull me in... Falls short, IMO."
4,Marc Braunstein is the Nostradamus for the DOT COM BUST,I love this book. Braunstein predicts the collapse of the Dot-Com boom almost to the exact day! His writing style reminds me of Thomas Marlowe or even James Joyce. A literary masterpiece and a delightfully humorous book.
3,Good Tool but needs to be sharpened better,This is a well made tool overall. Although it does not tell you in the description - it does come with a sort of sheath/edge guard.I was disappointed that the edge was not sharpened very well when I received the tool. It had a very heavy burr on it that had to be sharpened off to make the tool usable.If you plan on buying this tool make sure you can sharpen it before taking it on a job site.
3,Its ok,"as with a few othr reviews the tool is ok at best out of the box, was very dull when it arrived and needed to be sharpened before it was usable, again it was ok, you might wnat to save yourself the money and use a utility knife"
2,Boring Enough To Be a Bad Textbook,"The author presented extensive information about the Internet. She covered many aspects of the digital world, and to do so she has displayed a thorough knowledge of the subject. She seems to be quite industrious and intelligent.The presentation, however, lacked organization and continuty. She never established a purpose for the book, perhaps because she intended it as a reference for neophytes to the computer network; that was never made quite clear. The best way to describe this volume is ""labored.""There are many other books on this subject that more clearly and succinctly identify problems with the net, cures proposed, evaluations of those cures and how the net works."
1,Very frustrating experience!,"Couldn't get caller ID to work. Had several other people go over the instruction manual and nobody could make it work. (yes, I already pay for the caller ID service.) Tried to call Uniden for customer service-- ""At Uniden, we'll take care of you!"" is their motto. HA! I got a busy signal for days, and on the 3rd day, was put on hold for 10 minutes while recordings told me I was number 5 in the queue, number 4, number 3, until number 2 at which point they told me they were too busy and I should try again later. FORGET IT. DON'T BUY this phone; don't put yourself through the frustration."
1,Not Happy!!,"I had to return the item because it was to small. So i wanted to exchange for a bigger one. I tried to get in touch with someone from Freedom Display cases for weeks. They never answered my calls nor did they call me back when i left them a message.I am still dealing with them, i finally got in touch and sent the box back. I tracked the item yesterday, and they recieved it wednesday. But i still havent got a call or email from them. If i do not hear from them by Friday afternoon 5/20/11... I will have no choich but to contact my Lawyer, and also the B.B.B. I am very upset cause this was a present for my father, i take responability for ordering wrong size. But it shouldnt be this hard to return an item, or at lleast get in touch with someone. I will neve order another item from them. All i want is my money back like the promised in the email.Thank You,Jennifer"
3,I'm not saying I'm disappointed but,"This sounds of the old style country rock blues but I've met him in person a few times and he is underrated and I was at the concert in Ft. Worth Texas when he opened for Foreigner and frankly it blew me away and I haven't heard from him in quite some time, I prefer his fast paced stuff ('Skeletons In The Closet' comes to mind) and I met him at Blue Cat Blues in Dallas a few times and showed him a picture of himself jumping off the stage while he was in the middle of one of his solos he wanted me to give it to him but I had brought it in order for him to sign it and I've since lost it and I'm ashamed that I have lost it. But he'll always be remembered by me.laughingpig1@yahoo.com"
1,Save your five dollars.,"This book serves better as a sleeping pill. Too much filler and not enough substance. The premise was good, but the story never panned out. Read BABY I'M YOURS by Susan Anderson instead."
3,"Pretty good, but...","We received our Dragon wheel cover straight from Amazon, and despite what the description says, the white parts WERE turning yellow, even though it was ""new."" The cover was easy to install, and I love that it's so thick; my fingers don't feel cramped after driving because they're in a more relaxed position with this in place! It also hasn't gotten too hot, nor too cold -- wonderful! It took us a while to adjust the placement of the Dragons, though, because they feel weird to hold onto while driving. I don't know how well this will hold up... we had it on less than a day and the padded grey part ""snagged"" on something as we got in or out of the car, so the top layer is a little ragged for 3-4""; we'll have to tear it off or glue it somehow. Overall, it looks good and feels nice... I just don't know for how long."
5,Great deal for getting your purchase over $25 for fee shippin,"I needed three cents to get free shipping on my order, I have no use for this V-belt...but it makes a cool noise when you hit pillows with it... Overall it saved me around $7...so great buy."
4,gaming,"i am very excited to see how well organized it is to order my christmas gifts on line, i give all the products i have seen a very high mark, please keep up the good work, thanks again from, debbie"
2,"Yes, but...","Though I am a great admirer of Medem's work, I found this movie very unsatisfying. Considering the movie's ending, the thick web of coincidences really lead nowhere."
5,i love this movie!,"This is a great movie. It reminds me a little bit of Abre Los Ojos, another of Fele Martinez's films, in its darkness and the melancholy feeling that both movies share of unpredictability. I had no idea what was going to happen in this movie until the very end. I really liked it and I want to see Nimri and Martinez in more films."
3,a gem in disguise,"I'm a full time freelance copwriter, and find this book very useful. This ugly little blue guide is a gem in disguise. By helping us express concepts more vividly, analogies represent ""shortcuts to power writing,"" as this author conveys. This book has special relevance for us who need to effectively communicate and persuade others. For example, look up ""cowboy"" and you'll find a list of more than 150 words, from ""rawhide"" to ""buckaroo,"" as well as cowboy-related phrases like ""mess wagon"" and ""smile when you call me that."" Love it!"
3,Do not trust BuyPlumbing,I was hosed! Do not trust BuyPlumbing I need this right away and I was told twice it was in stock. I paid extra to second day ship it then I get an e-mail saying it's on back order for at least two weeks. They did NOTHING to try and solve the problem.
3,Photo Spots in SF Ca,"This book is really ooold! It needs to be updated; is there a newer edition?Conditions at the places, e.g., entrance fees, hours of operation, etc., have changed over the years.Best to get a more current book."
2,Not What I'd Hoped For,"When I picked up this book, I expected that it would be a thorough theological elucidation of the merits and dismerits of Messianic Judaism from the perspective of Christian theology and that it would present and even-handed evaluation of that movement. Sadly, that was not what I found.On the whole, I found this volume to be highly unbalanced. Of five authors contributing to the study, four were pro-Messianic and one was anti-Messianic. Such an unbalanced number of proponents and detractors is not in the best interest of serious theological study. Secondly, for me the book was a further disappointment in that it considered only the Messianic synagogue movement, rather than the entire notion of where, how, and to what extent should Jews who convert to Christianity retain Jewish practices, regardless of the question of synagogue legitimacy. There is so much more that could have been and should have been done with this topic, but sadly was not."
1,"""little"" book is TINY!",little book of.. is an understatement. print is TINY! returned all 7 i had ordered as gifts. recomend the original size
3,Handy Bible reference,"This is a well organized easy to use book. It doesn't have everything, but it is good for basic bible study."
2,"I thought ""Ultimate"" meant complete....","I saw this book at a friend's house and made a mental note to get it when I could. But it seems this copy that I bought is incomplete. Much of the index is there, but I wrote down references for manhood from my friends book that were omitted from this version, as well as inferiority. Now I would like to know how I can get the complete version!"
3,A Very Basic Topical Concordance,"Over four million of Ken Anderson's Where to Find it in the Bible are in print. I received it as a baptism gift back in 96 when the concordance was first published by Thomas Nelson. The back cover states that key Scriptures are placed at your fingertips without a lot of fancy theological language. That kind of description helps you understand that the book is not intended for a serious student of the Bible. If you are wanting a simple reference to help you find out what the Bible says about variety of subjects such as finances, marriage and war, this bestseller might be what you are looking for. I do believe that Mr. Anderson's interpretation concerning certain topics is off at times and that the illustrations are very childlike - the type of art that my sixth graders might produce. Despite these criticisms, I think Where to Find it in the Bible could be very useful for seekers and new believers of all ages."
5,"Essential resource for Christian writers, educators","The title describes exactly what you'll find: every contemporary topic you can think of, listed alphabetically, with lists of Bible verses that relate either by word or overall meaning. Compiling a lesson or sermon about compassion? You'll find a page and a half of possible references, with short descriptions like ""lack of compassion"" (Job 12:25) or ""gently lead"" (Galatians 6:1-2 CEV). Different translations are referenced, and some of the topics are offbeat or intriguing. I use this reference so often that the paper cover is curled and several pages have come loose from the binding. I so often am studying a topic and a Bible verse will come to mind, but I can't quite remember the exact words, or where to find it. This book has never failed to solve my ""40-something"" memory lapses!"
3,The absence of a mute button is a drawback.,Phillips and Alcatel make phones with better features overall
5,Years From Now...,...this book will be used to discuss the global warming cultists. Not that you can't apply it today but in a few more years it will be all the more obvious how the Warmists compare.
2,Compared to DOMINANT WIVES not that good but worth 3 bucks.,"I ordered DOMINANT WIVES AND OTHER STORIES at the same time I ordered this little, bity book which made this much smaller collection of Stanton's pictures, stories, etc. seem poor in comparison. There are a few good things here but spend the extra money and get DOMINANT WIVES if you want to see a more impressive view of female dominance, bondage, punishment,etc. provided by the strange, but fun, world of Eric Stanton."
3,A little disappointed,"I really wanted to like this as I'm a big McEwan fan. However, if I'm totally honest, I was a little disappointed with this, especially after all the excellent reviews. I don't think it ever really reached the emotional intensity of a Child in Time. Anyway, a below average McEwan is still worth the read."
2,Hit and Miss,"I fell for the tantalizing literati buzz on this book hook, line and sinker. While the author is certainly talented in his ability to craft prose that engage your tongue and mind at times, I felt the story lacked depth. I did not ""connect"" with the plotline - in fact, I nearly gave up mid-stream. The number of run-on sentences employed in the first section seemed cloying. An English teacher would have slashed and burned an 8th grade essay with the same content.I wasn't committed until about 75% of the way through and I did feel the story picked-up at that point. It became more engaging as the writing was much more crisp and compact. However, by the time the pace picked-up, I felt the remainder was merely hurtling toward a quick conclusion.So far, other readers I know (ranging in age from 16 - 60)share my sense of disatisfaction; can't wait for my book club discussion at the end of the month.Bottom-line: fulfilled my book club obligation; would have spent my $$$ on something else"
3,Couldn't get into it,"I decided to read Atonement because I knew there was a movie, and I like reading books and watching the movie versions of them. Unfortunately, I could not get into the book for a good part of it. I thought many parts were slow and boring. It took me a while just to finish the book. I just did not feel drawn to the characters. I will say that Atonement is beautifully written. Ian McEwan no doubt knows how to write, but unfortunately the writing could not save this story for me. For most of the book, I could not stand Briony. I thought she was annoying, and I hated how she ruined her sister Cecilia and Robbie's lives.What saved this book for me was the ending, and it is not a happy one. Briony knows what she did is wrong, but sometimes you cannot take back what you said. Sometimes there is nothing you can do but live with the consequences."
3,"Atonement not ""all that""","Contrary to many of the other reviews that have been posted, I thought McEwan's writing in ""Atonement"" was very cold and detached. Back in high school English class I learned good writers should ""show"" rather than ""tell""; McEwan leans much more toward ""tell"". Particularly frustrating were the very heavy-handed phrases such as, ""In later years, Briony would come to feel..."" Any editor worth his/her salt would have stricken these sentences!! The one exception to this, and the part of the book that grabbed me most and stays with me, is the scene at the hospital when Briony is a nurse probationer and the casualties come in.In all, ""Atonement"" is a decent book by a decent writer. Not great, not terrible, just solidly mediocre."
1,pretentious and boring,"If you suffer from insomnia, this is a great drug-free way to go into snooze mode. I just cannot fathom the great reviews, the lofty place on the best-seller lists, and the swooning praise of readers. Everyone in my book club just hated it, we all gave up at at various points in the book and chose something else to read. The lies and imaginings of a spoiled brat are described as some sort of grand ""crime."" Give me a break. This was truly one of the worst books I have ever read."
3,Frustrating Reading Experience,"After all the hype about how amazing this book is supposed to be, I am disappointed. The first part was interesting; the second part was boring (I skimmed most of it); the third part was okay. I wish I had just reread ""The Life of Pi,"" which is perhaps the best novel I've ever read."
3,"excellent plot, but disappointing",This book is a good example of one where the author hits on a fabulous plot opening and then isn't sure what to do with it. The first half of the book is a page-turner; I only wish the second half lived up to the promise.
2,Overrated- too wordy,"I chose this book because it had won so many awards and was disappointed. Although cleverly written (in the different voices/writing style of characters), I had to force myself to focus to get through the first 150 pages. It was like Briony was trying so hard to show that she was intelligent, she used unbelievably big words and took forever to describe something that could have been said in a few words. Once the story started to move, I enjoyed it and have decided it was worth the effort to finish it..."
3,I'll try again,"Frankly, I'm not too sure about this one. The language is great but I found it too 'elongated'. I guess it's just me..going into details for a certain scenario for too long isn't my taste.So for readers out there who are like me (I like books like 'Gap Creek', Frank McCourt's, Drowning Ruth, Umberto Eco's 'Name Of The Rose', etc. etc.)..you might want to think again before reading this.I'll give Ian's work another chance though..I have his 'Saturday'... maybe that will change my opinion."
2,A mishmash of themes,"I read this for my book club and was looking forward to it, based on all the buzz about book and movie.It's certainly an interesting literary excercise because the way the plot twists and turns and the different points of view. I enjoy reading novels that are set in the English countryside.But for me, it wsan't a good read. I thought it might be a love story with conflict. It's wasn't much of a love story, it wasn't a coming of age story and it wasn't a war story. Yet there are elements of each in this book, but it felt disjointed. I didn't really care about Dunkirk. I was glad when the lovers re-connected -- but that was just a figment of Briony's imagination.I didn't find the ending uplifting, because it didn't happen."
3,Didn't get it,"I bought this book ages ago and it sat on my shelf for a couple of years before I read it. Its one of those big suspense novels where you're waiting for the big secret to come out, and when it does your left thinking, so?"
4,Better than Amsterdam,"I couldn't believe this book didn't win the Booker Prize while Amsterdam did!!! Atonement is a MUCH better novel and while I still think some of the hype is over-rated, it's definitely worth a read, even in spite of the lack-lustre ending."
5,Best Book I've Read in 2002,"This book was a gift, and I had no idea what it was about before I starting reading it. By the end of the book, I was blown away--I had to take a long walk and think about it all. This a beautifully written book, and the story was amazing."
4,Compelling and throught provoking,"I loved the ending of this book, it made the read completely worthwhile and gave me something to think about for days afterward. I also enjoyed the dramatic changes in setting - from a calm summer night in the British countryside to a violent war zone and back again.Briony's search for redemption and forgiveness for the crimes of her childhood is the main theme of the book as it explores the relationships of the betrayer and the betrayed and the near impossibility of forgiveness and atonement for an action yielding disastrous results. The characters are real and compelling - you can feel and relate to their inner conflicts as well as outer circumstances. The beginning is a little slow but is worth it in order to reach the surprising yet satisfying end."
2,What was all the fuss about?,"I must agree with the previous reviewer...it was pure torture. I stayed with it only because of so many glowing reviews, saying to myself, ""The good part is just around the corner."" It never came."
2,Wordiness for wordiness' sake,"So the first 70 pages took forever to get through. It started picking up, but I didn't think the wordiness was worth the effort and didn't help the plot. The writing was beautiful, but beautiful writing that doesn't help advance the plot? What's the point? McEwan describes so much, so much that doesn't matter!!!! I thought this book was mostly boring, and had a very self important feel to it."
2,somewhat disappointing,"Atonement was highly recommended from a review I saw on TV- I was surprised at how slow the story moves --- it was in slo-mo for the first half -- then the war part dragged along. The ending is Ok, but not worthy of the high praise it had received."
1,Disappointing to say the least,"I read reviews before buying this book and was excited to get reading. About halfway through the book, and many yawns later I put this book down for good.The plot was very unstimulating, I could have cared less as to what happened to any of the characters. There was way too much discription and no real substance.This book was a waste of money and a waste of time."
1,Total disappointment!!,"Suprisingly dull, completely unsatisfactory! I really wish I had saved my money and my time!"
3,Atonement,"Atonement requires great patience to read. Its author, an established and respected writer, takes great pain to write intelligently, stylishly, with an occasional abstruse reference to impress his colleagues and readers, I suppose. McEwan subject is scintillating, interesting, and would surely engage the reader were it not for the author's obvious attention to the written word, which steals the reader's attention from the issues introduced in this work. Nonetheless, McEwan is good enough at his profession that you'll want to read his latest effort, in spite of its failings."
1,Boring....too much fluff,This could have been a very good book because is it shocking what the little girl does and consequences that result from it. But there was too much boring detail to make the book longer that it needed to be.
2,a waste of paper,"this is another strange book by ian mcewan,it features the misinterpretation of a young girl named Briony and her false accusation of the man who raped her cousin.it is cleverly divided into different time periods;1935,1939 and 1999 therefore showing the events leading up to world war 2 and during and after.it includes startling and accurate viewpoints from nurses and soldiers.i think this book is only let down by ian mcewans habit of rambling on and over analysing a situation or feeling. not a bad read but uneventful and slightly dated."
5,Wonderful,"I thoroughly enjoyed Atonement. When I was required to read this book senior year of high school, I rolled my eyes and bought the book. But now, Atonement sits on my book shelf untouched by dust because I have read it several times over. McEwan's characters are well developed and I could feel for each character, whether a good or bad situation. This dramatic novel has a surprising twist at the end that I did not expect at all. When I turned the last page, I felt that bittersweet feeling of finishing a fantastic book. I suggest this book to anyone who is wanting to read a classic novel but does not know where to start. Here is a great one. Enjoy."
3,More like 2.5 stars,"What is the big fuss over this book? It was a book of prose which really failed to really capture my interest. I only read it to the end because I feel compelled to finish what a book that I have started.The writer goes into painful descriptions of everything (which really insulted my imagination) and there was barely any dialogue. The story comes through the thoughts of the characters. This would have been fine, but their thoughts strayed way off track. I found myself being confused at certain parts.Basically, the book is a book filled with fillers, which I guess is just to add the to length of the book."
2,"slow, not for everyone","Maybe some people like this type of novel but it was one where I found myself trying to read it. Finally a third of the way through I gave up. I'm not a big fan of British humor, movies, and I guess now not novels. Way too slow and boring for me"
1,I`d rather read a dictionary,"I have one word for this book...BORING!!...A dictionary is more exciting than this tripe..A weak plot, if that`s what you can call it,,descriptions of various items that border on tedious,,how much description does a bedpan need anyway??? Save your time--go buy Webster`s ........."
2,It's satire folks!,"Many reviewers don't seem to get what McEwan is doing here. The first, tightly written first section (highly praised by most reviewers) is McEwan writing. The rest (roundly criticized by many) is satire. It is Briony writing in the overblown style we are warned to expect in the first section. The trick McEwan has to pull-off is to make Briony's writing sufficiently readable to drag the reader through to the final denouement. In my view his attempt at satire fails. It is too over the top and too long!"
3,Read it,"Atonement may start off a little slow, but ends up very good. I really liked this book alot and i would suggest it to any kind of reader. McEwan is an excellent writer with an intellegent style. His diction is amazing and makes the book that much better. However, the conclusion to the book really could have been left out. I found it tedious and tiresome. Read this book though, you wont regret it!"
3,"Good, but not Great","The brilliance of this novel eludes me. Although it is very good--well worth reading--it is not the exploration of its theme that I was expecting, that it should be to draw these reviews. They say it is well-crafted, and it is that; they say it is suspenseful, and it is that, as well; but, they also say it is comparable to his Booker Prize-winning book _Amsterdam_, and it isn't even close. It's a notch below it. Everything should come together in the end to reveal its message, theme, and ideas. It doesn't. In the end, it's a good book--well-crafted, well-written, thoroughly engaging, almost perfect. I recommend it, but I don't celebrate it."
2,Too long and drawn out!,I tried for weeks to read this book and still haven't finished it. It is just so so slow! Not sure I could finish...when I inquired about the movie 'Atonement' reviews were quite similar...Definitely not my cup of tea!
5,Powerful novel,"Read this book if you enjoy literature. Mr. McEwan manages to pack maximum emotional and spiritual power into his understated narrative.The first 50 pages or so go slowly as we are introduced to the various key characters, but then as we become vested in the characters, we cannot put the book down."
1,You'll Love It or You'll Hate it,"Personally, I hated it. The writing was beautiful, the characters were alive and realistic and the story was believable yet moving; and I hated it. It was difficult for me to get into and while some moments seemed to drag on for 50 pages, others seemed to pass in a paragraph. I found myself skipping over pages and saying to myself ""Ok, I get it already, move on"". This was my primary reason for disliking the book, my other reasons are based more on personal taste so I won't bore you with them. Basically, I can put up with a lot for a good ending. Atonement's ending lacked... well, an ending."
2,"Cramped, overwritten book","I won't offer a plot summary that can be found in other book reviews. I'll offer my frank opinion that this book is over-rated and destined for the literary dustbin. ""Atonement"" is a cramped miniaturist piece that aspires to something greater, particularly in its commentary about written narrative, but ultimately, the major plot points boil down to the warped opinions of an adolescent mind. Lies, false accusations, fanciful opinions, need for drama--all products of a prepubescent's girl's mind. And unfortunately, a rather likable student is sent to war, separating him from his true love, because everyone is too willing to believe the idiotic opinions of the teenage girl Briony."
5,Jesus Christ Superstar dvd,Product was bought as a gift for my sister. She had worn out her vhs copy some time ago. It's her favorite movie. I was surprised at the speed in which the order reached me. Very pleased with the product and Amazon
1,Jesus Christ Superstar(1973),I have this DVD version of Jesus Christ Superstar because I did not like the way Norman Jewison made the songs in this version. (I did like the Overture) As far as the video goes - what was the deal with the Bus? And the Army tanks? And the Planes? The director's choices were a distraction. Back to the music - did any make the observation that the director forgot to put in the reprise of the song Everything's Alright that is in the the Andrew Lloyd Webber version of the DVD? Buy the other version(Jesus Christ Superstar-Broadway) Made by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice. Don't buy this one (Jesus Christ Superstar-1973)unless you are a collector of musicals like me!
1,About that dont blow your money on this movie.,"I didnt like the movie because it did not enternain very well and, besides my teachers makin me do this because she liked it a little to much if u get what i mean.The main reason i did not like is because it was a musical. I really do not like musicals. Way back when the movie was made no1 really liked it because it was about relegion, and offended non-christians,christians.If u like it thats fine with me but i SERIOUSLY would not buy this movie."
1,Places your Immortal Soul in jeopardy,"I have read reviews wherein friends have stated that, religious beliefs notwithstanding, it was a good film. How in the name of Hoot Gibson can a movie about Jesus be regarded as anything but religious. People are going to watch it and draw conclusions about the Life of Our Savior.""For all you care, this bread could be My Body!"" Are you kidding me? Where these the words with which He instituted the Eucharist?I had a Catholic tell me that Jesus isn't REALLY present in the Eucharist. It's just a ""symbol!"" He may have gotten this impression from watching ""Modernist"" heresey like this movie.I like to watch movies about my Faith, however, I reached a point, in my life, when I said that I would never again watch one about Our Lord."
1,"Superstar?, More like Bench Warmer","Ted Neeley should be crucified, literally, for being the worst Jesus in any film. Was Jimmy Stewart unavailable to play a worse version of Jesus? I think Ted Neeley is also the first person to play Jesus with a lazy eye. This is just the beginning of my problems with this movie.I could have sworn Yoko Ono was playing Mary Magdaline. The actress had the same vocal abilities as Yoko. In my opinion, Elton John did the best job playing King Herod. Rick James would have made a great Judas.I realize my review is just addressing the acting, what about the plot you ask? There was not one. The keep singing bad songs until they are mercifully stopped when Jesus is crucufied. The best part was making the Last Supper into a picnic. Who brought the Spam?As a Christian, I have never hated a Bible story. But what they have done to the story of Jesus life certainly has turned the greatest story into a sham. I would rather go blind than watch this again."
1,Who the Hell did they get to play Jesus?!,"The guy who plays Jesus is an awful singer. He ruined the entire movie sounding like the lead from some punk band. Also, it's clear they did not cast the actors based on their looks (or even their talent for that matter). I tried very hard to like this. I love musicals but this ranks down there with Cats, Hair, and Nine. If you want a great musical based on the scripture, check out the amazing Godspell."
5,Well Worth It,"I first saw Jesus Christ Superstar when it was released in the mid 1970's. Being a Catholic I was skeptical of the Passion being done in a Rock Musical style. However, what I found was it was a wonderful way in which to have those who are not interest in religion or the history of the Passion to become aware of what a remarkable story it truly is. Not only the scenery but the wonderful music, the closeness to the truth that is contained and even with some straying for a sign of the time, it was and is one of my very favorites to watch during the Lenten Season of Easter. I highly recommend this dvd for the entire family."
2,Missing Feature Commentary with Director ...,"""Feature Commentary with Director Norman Jewison and Actor Ted Neeley""when selected this will take you back to the main menu, making you think it doesn't work. What it does is turn on the commentary that is the two of them talking during the showing of the movie. To turn it off, just reload the DVD."
5,Rompe los esquemas religiosos,El rol de Magdalena junto a Jesus cristo rompe los patrones de comportamiento establecidos por la religiosidad
1,They spoiled the great music,"They spoiled the great music of Andrew Webber.Well... not every one of them, but mostly."
3,Another butchered classic,"While the original JCS is by far a moving and exciting experience, the ""new"" DVD widescreen format chops the heads off much of the cast - not something practiced frequently in the original I saw on television. I had purchased this hoping to be excited once again, but since you only get half the picture (the middle half), maybe consider taping it next time it's on the box."
3,Frustrating tracks/chapters,"This DVD is of course true to the original. The only disappointing and frustrating part is that the chapters are not arranged song by song, but tends to run two songs together in the same chapter.For instance, the Overture and ""Heaven on their Minds"" should be seperated, but are instead in the same track. ""Strange Thing Mystifying"" is combined with ""Then we are Decided"", but ""What's the Buzz"" is off on its own track! ""This Jesus Must Die"" is on the same track as ""Everything's Alright"". ""Poor Jerusalem"" is combined with ""Simon Zealotes"", etc.This results in a frustrating arrangement if I just want to hear a specific song, but can't get to it directly. It's also frustrating if you want to skip a song completely, but want to hear the next song.I wouldn't imagine that having a DVD with more than 24 chapters would be that difficult. If having the songs separated is important to you, then don't bother getting the DVD... :-)"
5,awesome,"OK, granted this musical was done in the early 70's and therefore has some 70's overtones, but the acting and singing are magnificent. The relationship between Judas and Jesus is powerful, and Ted Neeley stares right into your soul. I first saw this movie when I was about 7 years old and it left a lasting, positive influence on me regarding Christ."
4,Slight Misdirect. Its a TYC brand unit.,This was actually a TYC condensor shipped to me. Quality looked a little rough but it works and NO leaks so far after 2 weeks. Price was right so I can live with it.
1,The Oreo Cookie Counting Book,"Wow, this is amazing. Nothing but a marketing ploy by a large company producing worthless food. Oreo cookies for adults who can make their own decisions about eating heavily processed foods loaded with sugar and trans-fats is one thing, but for kids? There is enuf pressure in the world for kids to eat terrible things for them... the junk food industry should stay out of kids books."
4,informational,"I never got to do the extensive hike I wanted to, but I felt like this book helped me understand all the places to go. Even has off the path camping lists that I have referred to a few times."
3,Get the WB Greatest Hits/Misses If Your On a Budget,"If your a Spud down on your luck and on a budget, get the WB Greatest Hits/Misses, you'll get over 30 of their songs on 2 used CD's for about the price of this one alone. If you're not on a budget than get all their WB releases, its worth it! There are a lot of great songs that they didn't have room for."
3,Average Headset,"The headset was received in a timely manner. The headset, in my opinion, is not very sturdy, and doesn't stay in my ear very well."
3,Too liberal for me,"This book was chosen by my professor because it gives a very liberal view of social problems in the world today. Being more down the middle on most issues, this book seemed to always be whining about how the government isn't doing enough and all the people affected by poverty or racial discrimination should blame the government for their problems. Too much system-blame, no victim-blame possibilities explored even partially."
2,totally lame book...,"... that was required for a class. It was what the teacher wanted but WOW what a boring read. Like any other school book, this had some useful tools but you need several shots of espresso to read the rest. BIGGEST ISSUE was not being able to return the book after I was done with it. Now it is sitting in my closet til that fateful day I have a fireplace in my abode and need kindling."
5,William Bennett and George Malcolm in the Bach Flute Sonatas,"This evidently is a reissue.I have Jean Pierre Rampal and Robert Veyron Lacroix performing the Bach Flute Sonatas on cassette, and wanted a CD recording of these lovely pieces. William Bennett and George Malcolm fit the bill. Theirs is a fine CD on several counts: expert, highly musical playing; all 6 Bach flute sonatas on one CD; clear sound; and budget price. William Bennett has a beautiful, liquid tone, and George Malcolm is a superb harpsichordist. Both musicians are balanced well, in a clear, up front acoustic, with Bennett seeming to be slightly forward, and Malcolm in a supportive role.William Bennett plays a modern flute. The give and take between Bennett and Malcolm is superb.A most enjoyable disc, highly recommended."
2,useless laser,"The scissors work well but they are bulky. Over hyped laser is useless and time consuming as you have to draw a line, project the laser then follow it. Laser keeps my cat entertained but no much use for straight cutting. Do not buy."
1,bad batteries,I bought these for gifts-4 of them. Opened one for myself and it didn't work. Opened the battery compartment and the batteries were corroded. On 3 of the 4. Not a great gift!!!
2,Laser scissors,Purchased for a Christmas present. When the person opened it and tried to use them it would not work. Checked batteries and it was not getting a good concection. A wire was loose. Have not been able to fix it.
5,Great Video!,I have been working out pretty hard for my upcoming wedding and have over done it quite a few times. This morning I woke up and my legs hurt so bad I was limping. I did this video and it was like a miracle. The pain was gone! I had to do it again later in the day just because it made me feel so good. I plan on doing this video before working out from now on.
4,The standard American translation of canon law.,"This is the standard American translation of the 1983 Code of Canon Law. There are a few translations in it which have received criticism, but because the Latin original text is provided on facing pages (a benefit which distinguishes the American translation from the British), these flaws are not serious. There are no footnotes in this edition of the code, and no commentary on the canons. The index of terms is hardly sufficient. Still, the advantages of the book (for example, its portablity) make it very useful for Americans, second only to a major comentary on the canons."
3,Outdated translation,"I was unable to find accurate information about the edition of this book before buying it; if I had, I would have known that it was the original English translation and not the updated, more faithful one. This edition also does not include the few additions to the canons that have come out since 1983. It was a disappointing waste of money, although it may give me an incentive to work on my Latin."
2,Not the One!,"I enjoyed the first Elizabeth Bevarly mainstream novel and even those published by Silhouette. However, these last few have missed the mark. ""He Could be the One"" should not have been published as a mass market mainstream novel. The plot is flimsy and was held together by the author repeating the heroine's thoughts and speech repeatedly in order to stretch the story. While Eve and Wyatt's story could have been fantastic if given the proper depth, this rendition only left a disappointed fan. I sensed the secondary character, Eve's sister Simone, might get a story of her own. If so, lets hope the author takes the time to develop the story more fully before going to market. I would suggest buying this used or waiting for a paperback exchange at your local library. I probably won't make another purchase unless I read the reviews first."
2,tedious,"The problem with romantic comedy plots is that too many authors writing for the genre have no sense of humor. Or else their humor is so tedious it has the reader pulling her hair out. That was certainly the case with Bevarly.The thought that two grown women are so obsessed with events/people from high school twenty years earlier is really quite pathetic. An entire book around that premise is excruciating. The entire plot is one contrivance after another.This author needs to study up on writing men. Men do not talk like that!!! The two guys in the story were indistinguishable from each other when they spoke, as were all the flat cardboard characters.It's interesting to note that the only people who gave this book a good review are other writers. Certainly the readers weren't fooled in this instance."
4,Great book for a balanced Biblical Faith,"I got this book to help me as i worked through a very trying time in my walk with God. As I read, I began to realize that though outwardly I looked like a great christian, inside I was very confused about my idea of who God was and how he related to me. I belive that the health of any Christian is dependant on his/her understanding of God, and mine had a lot of holes in it. This book has been very helpful in helping me confront a lot of painful misunderstandings I have had about God, and i fully recommend it to anyone who is struggling in thier faith or just feel that their faith is bringing more opression to their lives than freedom."
2,This Book was Over Rated,The book was advertized as sounding like a documentation It is ficton book Not what I thought it would be
2,Disappointing effort by author,"Having previously read and enjoyed IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE byRobert K. Tanenbaum, I looked forward to listening to RECKLESSENDEARMENT . . . I further wanted to catch-up on what washappening with two characters i had ""met"" in the previous book,Butch Barp and Marlene Ciampi . . . they discover themselvesworking on two sides of the same case when several homicidesrock downtown manhattan . . . but was I ever disappointed! . . . itis an excessively convoluted thriller that starts well, then gets boggeddown with too many characters and subplots . . . I also didn't find itvery believable . . . I'll take a ""pass"" on other books byTannenbaum; i.e., unless somebody tells me that Ijust caught the author on a rare bad day/effort."
2,"Nothing special, poorly written","I have to wonder if he is getting revenue based on the number of commas used in the book. I actually found 1 page that only has two (very long, convoluted) sentences! Reading this is about as entertaining as wading through hip deep mud, and equally as frustrating. Much time is spent on garbage which has no direct bearing on the plot (kitchen design & cooking habits) - way beyond what is needed to develop the plot. Not enough 'meat' in this one to hold my attention."
3,"Enjoyable listening, but...","Peter Benchley makes a good, light, and accomplished reading of his own book. This is easily accessible and not bogged down with science, though depending on what you want, that could be a drawback also. There are some good personal anecdotes. I liked the story of Peter's swim (flight?) on the back of a Manta Ray, and the time he nearly got his family eaten by Hammerheads.It should be said that the book seems a little disjointed at times, and there are chapters that actually have nothing to do with sharks, but instead talk about safety in the water and other sea creatures. The author takes a strong environmental attitude throughout with regard to shark conservation, and is critical of the bad press sharks get in the media (but Peter, didn't you.. er.. have just a little to do with that?)A good book for light reading or listening, but don't expect too much in the way of serious information."
1,tiny but has problems,"this mouse is cool to look at but it has problems. the major issue i have with it is that if you scroll too fast with the scroller the pages tend to start scrolling the wrong way, for instance if you scroll down using the scroller, the pages start scrolling up. this only happens if you scroll to fast. This little gripe can make looking at web pages or searching the internet a horrible experience because the pages tend to be over scrolling. As for the software, i did not receive any. so as of now, i have given up and reverted back to using my touchpad on the laptop. there are better ones out there so don't buy it even if it costs a measly 19 dollars"
4,Playing with Fire,"The principals in this book are sound. However, top management must make the full commitment and follow the principals as defined. Trying to shortcut the process will have detrimental results if not disastrous. The concepts in this book my sound very radical but in actuality are common sense. And that is the pitfall. I have seen where a company makes a commitment toward lean manufacturing. But somewhere along the line management thinks they can modify the principals or they begin to not see immediate results and they don't follow the plan to fruition. They end up losing money or their shirt! The hard way is always the easiest way. If you own your own company or are trying to sell this concept to management in your present work environment, it is important that everyone in the organization makes a commitment to Lean thinking. Do not cut corners and stay the course. Don't play with fire."
1,"Lots of generalities & buzzwords, little usable examples","I was disappointed in this tape. (The book may be better. I have not read it) The tape is a couple of hours of generalities. More like a promo for the author's consulting business. Without business specifics, without some detail on how the results were accomplished, I did not find it useful."
3,too much fun with reverb,"I got this CD after hearing the guy DJ live. The show was amazing, smoothly mixing drum'n'bass with hip-hop beats. But the advantage Mr. Tobin had there was that he was using other people's music.On ""Out From Out Where"" one track blends into the next, not just in terms of being mixed together but also in the mental impression it leaves. Most of the tracks are spacey background noises, unmemorable reverbed melodies and unmemorable reverbed drum'n'bass or hip-hop beats. One standout is the second track, ""Verbal"", which employs cut-up rap vocals, a technique made pioneered by Prefuse 73's Scott Herren (who, I might add, was also at the show). Other than that, the sound is too sloppy dancing but too noisy for chillin."
3,Not really a mystery.,"If you are a hard core reader of who-dunnits, you may be disappointed by this book. It is not really a mystery, but more a gritty,non-stereotypical book about NY's Chinatown. An interesting read, if for no other reason than you have not read anything like this before.And if you like this one, the author's next book, Year of the Dog, is worth it as well. A bit more rambling in its plot than this one, but delves deeper into Chinatown and focuses even less on the 'mystery.'"
3,It wasn't what I have expected but ok,It wasn't what I have expected. It was an okay read. I thought there would have been more but not really at all. Would I buy it? no i would borrow it from the library. It was a freebie which was good.
3,"interesting, but with potholes","as others have mentioned, the 'pluses' of this book are that it's an interesting dive into a culture/milieu that we rarely read about, and much of it rings true. the plot is a bit scattered, but that seemed fine. However, the book also has some really stereotypical rants against african-americans, and sterotypical behavior _by_ african-americans, as the author engages in the same cliche stereotyping that he inveighs against for chinese-americans."
3,Mediocre,"I had similar thoughts to another reviewer - the story did give a good perspective on the triads and the chinese associations, but I found the storyline weak and meandering. There were some points in the book that I found hard to follow the storyline."
3,"good, but not great","I found this an interesting book about the Chinese in New York. There were lots of unique characters--so many that it was hard to find the plot. You don't really get into the mystery until half way through the book. The second half almost made up for the slow first half, but not quite."
5,Must Read,One of the best books I've read. Very practical spiritual essays that will bring hope and comfort to whomever reads it.
3,"The Bus Converter's Bible, 2nd Edition","The author states this is not a ""how to"" book at the beginning, and this is so. There are some interesting segments and information, but, if you looking for a ""how to"" then this book is not what you are looking for. No disrespect to the author."
5,Excellent for kids,"I am experienced model builder, grandson (9 years old) is not. I bought the 1:96 size for me and the 1:196 for him. There is a few less pieces but we work on the same sections at the same time. It really helps him to understand."
5,It's about engaged reading. . .,"Action Strategies for Deepening Comprehension is a wonderful resource for any educator who wants to engage students in learning and in critical thinking about text (fiction and non-fiction). The drama techniques outlined in this book are based on research and on Dr. Wilhelm's real classroom experiences. Dr. Wilhelm explains how these strategies can be used before, during, and after reading to 'help students enter the community of expert readers.' Every time I go back to this book to try another technique (and there are tons of them with many variations) I feel inspired by Dr. Wilhelm's enthusiasm so that I can't wait to try it out with my middle school students. I can say with confidence that I haven't had one fail yet. The movement, interaction, and creative outlet provided by these action strategies help my students connect with text and comprehend its meaning."
2,Not What I expected!,DVD's Are ok Im sure I could of just go them from any store But I Bought this set Expecting to get the Golden Thomas 60th Anniversary that's showing on picture...Instead I got a really small plastic Thomas!...Not Happy!!
4,Freezer Bags,"It is hard to find good, thick freezer bags. I bought these since the price worked out good for each box. I can't say that these are thick. The ones that I received are the blue bags with the wide zipper. I do like the fact that the zipper on these is wide. I am not too sure about the bag itself. It seems about as thick as a regular storage bag."
4,gotta hear this!New Artist of The Future!,this is a great cd-especially for his first.cd features keak da sneak which we all know and love.artist is and up and coming-sure to be a hit.has been compared to the style of nas and tupac based on the ability to rap and sing.
1,Invasive Without a Cause,"While I appreciate Wim Wenders' desire to fulfill Nick Ray's last wish and admire his courage to grope his way forward without a script, I question the merit of filming his friend's dying days. Though it was at Nick's behest, it seemed an indecent invasion of privacy. I would say (with Matthew Arnold), ""Spare me the whispering, crowded room, the friends who come and gape and go, the ceremonious air of gloom - all, which makes death a hideous show."""
5,THE BEST RAVE/TECHNO BAND OUT THERE!!!,"This band is one of my all time favorites! I have loved Scooter since discovering them through a friend in 1994. This CD is good....but it is missing the classic rave hits ""Hyper Hyper"" and ""Move Your Ass!"". How could you do a Scooter greatest hits compilation and not include them?! It's an absolute travesty! Besides that problem, this one is a keeper! I guarantee that if you get this, you won't be staying still for long! These guys know how to get you dancing....and that's no joke. Finally, there is H.P. Baxxter on lead vocals! What a great voice...and a hot looking guy! This one is highly recommended....but if you want to be exposed to the earlier hits...then also get OUR HAPPY HARDCORE and the first album."
2,The best of? Not really.,"This album doesn't offer ""The best of Scooter"" Only the best after 1998. All the previous singles like ""Move your Ass"" ""Back In the UK"" ""Fire"" and ""The Age of Love"" are not present here. It's a allright album for starters but personally I think that the music they made from 1994-1999 was the best and many of those songs are not here, while lots of newer one's that doesn't offer you the true sound of Scooter that are here aren't very good. I own ""Rough & Tough & Dangerous: 94-98"" that does include some of the classics and it also offers you some wonderful instrumental trance songs that really proves the genius of this band (We don't see that very often anymore though). While songs like ""How Much is the Fish"" ""I'm your Pusher"" ""Call me Manana"" and ""We are the greatest"" are all great songs you can find them on ""No time to Chill"" instead, other then that, get the album I recommended instead of this that isn't really their ""Best of"" anyway."
5,"AM I A DREAMER? MAYBE, BUT SOMEDAY",THIS BOOK WILL BE PRAISED...If all the parents in the world...If all the children on Earth ...Could set this mighty values into their hearts..THIS WORLD WOULD BECOME EDEN !Really: This is the best treasure you can inherit your children !!
4,Troubled Water,A delightful book. Full of wonderful facts. Something that a teacher could do well with in class as well as a great book for the home.
5,A collector's dream come true,"Belinda has done a fabulous job cataloging and pricing my favorite collectible, Roosters and Roses. The color photographs of the various items are beautiful and really show off the pieces wonderfully. I don't collect any other PY items but I found the rest of the book delightful with the whimsical photos and wealth of information. Hats off to Belinda! My husband and I now have new Roosters and Roses ""horizons"" to conquer thanks to her.Grateful readers,Alexis and Bob Stone,Florida"
1,da vinci sugarfree syrups,"having a lot of heath problems, included adeep diabetes , i resolved to try the Da Vinci sugarfree syrups and neverthless their claims what i ended up with was a super artificial tasting blend;no matter the flavor i choosed.This syrups are the right stuff as a present for your worst enemy"
3,UFC Is Finally Back In Brazil!,"The three matches I mostly bought this dvd for; Silva vs Okami, Nogeira vs Schaub, and Griffin vs Rua 2 were worth buying this dvd alone because they all ended with finishes. The card overall was decent. The main thing I liked about this event is that the UFC finally returned to Brazil."
1,Lame,"T-Rock's lame and soft, he got shot at by DJ Paul and ran all the way to Atlanta. T-Rock's out of the picture and nothing without HCP. CD = Trashed just like T-rock's career."
3,Can't syncronize,"It seems to be a reasonable buy but it has serious drawbacks: - hard to move from one screen to the other, - hard to search for something, - almost impossible to syncronize with the PC"
2,Far from my expectation,"I didn't like this soap. I found it didn't produce much lather, even with a washcloth, plus I found the smell off-putting - it did smell ""porky"". Both of these made me not want to continue using the soap."
1,lye soap,"this product was supposed to help acne it did not work for me, and it smells like your bathing in pork lard i would not recommend."
3,Lye Soap,I got this for mu husband who had sensitive skin as well as eczema. He was pleased with the product over all as it stopped his itching. I did not clear up his skin condition however.
4,a little gem,"No, it's not original. No, it won't change your life. But it is beautiful, and has more moments of sheer musical poetry than most groups manage in an entire back catalogue. I go for track number 5 (shine) as the loveliest."
5,"Love it, Love it",This CD is awesome. I love all the songs except the Obsession Remix. Ensename Olvidar is like the best song in the whole wide world. This CD is a must have.
2,Obsessed with seeking good music? U won't find it here.,"I have just purchased Frankie J's ""The One"" Album, with the newest cover of Obesession (No Es Amor), and i was pretty appalled by 3rd Wish's cover of the same song, so whilst browsing around Amazon, i found some positive comments made regarding the original, and some criticism of Frankie's cover.So being the positive person that i am, i decided to listen to Aventura's song, and i felt violated!, never had i ever heard anything so uncivilised! When i insulted the ""Garage"" phenomenon for its pots and pans beats, i never meant for the term to be taken literally, yet somehow Aventura took this to heart and DID use pots and frying pans to create their backing tracks!So please do refrain from purchasing this album, as you will be breaking the rules if you buy this album."
2,BAD product,"This product is great if you like ""please Wait"" because thats what you'll be seeing a lot. everytime you want to change the function, or trun it on!! it's a very slow unit, i never thought i'd have to ""boot up"" my DVD player!and . . . there is no display on the tv for the volume etc. . everything is displaied on a tackey monochrome display on the unit itself.But the Worst Part is the fact that i cannnot watch a DVD without the picture going Black&White half way through. sence my palyer in older than the whole 90 day warentee pariod. i not only would have to pay to get it fixed but it would have to shiped at my expence and the repair would take 6 MONTHS!!!!This is a truly poor product form a poor company"
3,Great book! But pages keep falling out!,"I have never written a book review before, and this one does not focus on content. From what I have read so far, I would recommend Sor Juana's writings to friends and colleagues. However, don't buy this series. I don't know if I just got a bad copy, but after only reading a few sections of the book, pages started to fall out! They don't tear, they just fall out. I'm a divinity student with LOTS of books; this has never happened before. It's very frustrating... Read Sor Juana, just consider a different series."
2,Pretty much junk,I bought this set because of many positive reviews. My experience has been less than satisfactory. Within 6 mo two of the lights stopped working and no amount of fiddling could make them work again. I believe a problem with the batteries or solar chargers. After a year they all weren't working and three of them the solar panel on top had broken away from the shade. For me they were a waste of money.
4,Dense and Delightful,"Umberto Eco enjoys telling a thick story. Baudolino is exactly that. A pseudo-historical novel, it chronicles the life of Baudolino, a master of languages and lies. Eco tells a fantastic story, taking Baudolino from a poor peasant to searching for the mythical preacher-king Prester John. What makes Baudolino so intruiging is the aspect of the unreliable narrator. Since Baudolino the compulsive liar is telling his own story, the reader can never be sure what the truth really is. This leads to some very wild tales that complicate the story to no end. Baudolino was an extremely enjoyable novel, but requires the reader to have a little patience to weed through this dense thicket of a story."
1,Patriarchal religion in a dress,"This book is all about praying to a deity to make your ""spell"" work. That is not, in fact, spellcraft. It's just prayer with some props. If you're into having a power exterior to yourself do your work for you, then you'll like this book. If you are, in my opinion, more evolved than that and you seek to strengthen and employ the power within your Self, then you'll find this book about as helpful as a Baptist hymnal."
4,Midnight Voices- Very Suspenseful,Midnight Voices by John Saul was a very good book. The beginning was a little confusing. It introduced so many characters that it was hard to keep it all straight. Once the characters started interacting it was easier to follow. From there it was really interesting. It was suspenseful and kept my interest by making me want to keep reading to see what would happen next. Saul really brings it to life with his very detailed descriptions.
5,Brilliant Competition,"The reviewer above who doesn't understand how one can love this album AND admit that they are playing against, rather than with, each other, just doesn't get it. That's what grabs me in every minute of this recording- three brilliant minds, challenging each other to break out of the square box of jazz in all its forms. It's clear that each of these men is a composer in their own right, and the competition is thick. It's like watching a boxing match between the top heavyweights- every second is fascinating. I can feel Mingus struggling to impress the Duke, and sometimes getting grumpy when he can't keep up. Then he starts plucking aggressively, daring Ellington to break out. Roach, always the gentleman, dodges and sways with each punch the two dish out, like a cool referee. I love every minute of it."
2,Forgettable and Disappointing!,"I had never read any of Jonathan Kellerman's novels but I picked up this book because I thought that it would explain violent children. Instead, I felt like I had wasted my money on this book because it didn't explain much but circumvented the issues. I think the title says a lot calling violent children as savage spawn. Is he implying that children are born evil? No, I don't think so. I think he means well but the children described and their cases have many underlying factors such as poverty, broken homes, divorce, single parents, violence, and abuse to help infuse their violent natures. No, children aren't born violent but are nurtured by these factors. Kellerman sounds like an expert without having to deal with first-hand as if it's not his neighborhood. His reflections are quite vague in thought despite his background."
1,College material,"I haven't read anything this dry or boring since psych classes in college. I am usually an avid reader on psychology, especially on children. It could have been a great book if more research and background on violent children would have been completed. Kellerman's fiction books are better."
4,More East than West,"I really enjoyed this CD. The recording was clear with good depth and dimension (even though some of the pieces were recorded live).Although some of my favorite personnel are missing from this recording, the band in gerneral did a commendable job. The sax section was very impressive, and I found the trombone solos very enjoyable. I kept wishing the trumpet section had a more powerful lead man. I really missed the power and projection of Bill Chase or Gary Grant in the ultra high register.I was also hoping that they would have selected some of the mid-sixties to early-seventies pop numbers that sounded so corny back then, but are so ""in"" now.This CD is a must for anyone who is a collector of recodings of the Herman band from this period. Buy it, but don't expect many jaw dropping double high c's from the trumpets."
5,Great product,I replaced the Toshiba modem that I was renting from Cox ($15/mo) with this Linksys cable modem. Modem prices have dropped considerably since I got cable 2-1/2 yrs ago. The setup was very easy (I get nervous around computers). I used the ethernet port to make the connection. It took a simple phone call to Cox to change their settings to match my new address and I was up and running in no time. Haven't had any problems. I use this cable modem in conjunction with the Linksys 4-port router. Another convenience is that the cable modem can be stacked with the cable router.
1,Different Image Then Shown,"I recently purchased the modem. When I got it today, I noticed that it was not the newiest cable modem v2. it was the older one, which stands up and is not stackable with other Linksys products.If you want to purchase the modem, so you can stack it with the router, watch out. The current image that is shown in the Amazon site is the newier one which they are not shipping."
1,Mystified by this bad modem,"It caused my computer to crash. The microsoft error message blamed the modem's version 3 driver. Tech support emailed me a beta version - but still no fix. Some have suggested the problem lies with the ISP, but Comcast techs weren't any help with it. (They insisted everything looked fine on their end.) Come on, guys, a modem shouldn't be tricky. I had planned to purchase a Linksys wireless router -- but not after dealing with this piece of junk."
4,Great Item!,This item is DOCSIS 1.1 but is still able to handle up to 30Mbit/s.I have been running 25Mbit down 3Mbit up with no problems.
2,Linksys modem version,The version sold me was version 1. This is an old version. Version 2 is the current version. Requests for the version before purchased received evasive replies. Version 2 has more features. So make sure you get the current version
1,Watch Out for Tech Support!,"They had free support until just very recently. My beef is with the EXTREME cost of support, 3.99 a minute. ( I don't know if that includes listening for many minutes to bad music.) You can get 3 months support for $199, 6 months for $299 or 1 year for $499!!! I can tell you I spent many hours talking to tech support before this recent change of events. I have had my Linksys router for 3 years. I also had to get a bridge to extend the range because it couldn't go through walls very well. I had to call them a lot because sometimes the bridge or router somehow lost the address.You will need tech support now and again when you change ISPs, etc.. Until they change these charges I recommend going elsewhere."
4,Linksys Cable Modem,Excellent product. I plugged it in and it worked with no modifications to my software needed. What else can you ask?
2,Version 2 is broken,"Since it was released, the BEFCMU10 has experienced technical problems that linksys has attempted to fix by comming out with new versions of the same modem. These technical issues cannot be resolved by the end user. Updates to the modem software must be sent ""down the line"" from the cable end of the modem. The firmware that is shipped with version 2 of this modem is very unstable. If your ISP is not making the update availible to the modem, dont buy it."
3,works great,Will not work on Windows XP...Drivers are not available yet.but it worked on my other computer which had Windows ME.Like the slim design.
2,Hangs every once in a whule,I have 3-4 computers connect to this modem at any given time.If there is a lot of traffic the modem just hangs !I need to restart it (a 30sec process) and everything is back to normal ... but it's really annoying that I have to restart it ..the freq is about 2 times a week and if I create a lot of traffic even every 20 min !!
2,NOTE TO TEACHERS,"While this book is beautiful, it's one to read yourself BEFORE reading to a class. The first few pages of the book include pipes, cigarettes and ""making love."" Again, the story is beautiful, but not so great for a bilingual classroom of 6-year-olds, especially in conservative areas."
1,It didn't work,I wanted to get this to use with our computer modem to keep from paying the phone company $90 to install a phone jack. Well it didn't work. I'm hoping it will at least work for our DirecTV box.
1,too much interference,"I bought this item for a customer. There was so much electrical noise on the system that you couldn't hear a dial tone at all. I then took the system to my house which has a good grounding system thinking that the electrical interference would be minimized but found that although it would work, there was the electrical hum there also and very loud. I tried to use it for a fax line, but half the time the faxes wouldn't go through so I had to disconnect it and I'm probably going to throw it away since I've had it so long I don't feel right about returning it."
2,almost worthless,"Tried 2 of these things, one with an RCA label andone under the HP label (same product). They bothdid the exact same things. Bad. I was going to use2 extension units, one for a telephone, and one fora modem. When used as a basic telephone, it had abuzz in the audio. Not enough to be unusable, butannoying. When used as a modem, I could only get amax throughput of 36K. I normally get 50.6K. I havea 1-year old house with new wiring, so I'm not goingto blame the wiring. Bad product."
3,works for me with DISH Receiver,didn't have a manual. the one I found online didn't say I had to press the little button to activate the units. I hooked up a phone and the connection seemed very noisy. I connected it to my DISH Network DVR and it connected.
2,"OK for basic use, but not much else","This saw is OK for someone who needs to do nothing other than simple straight rips. The power is adequate, and the saw is stable when mounted on a stand.However, my MAJOR complaint is that the miter slots on the table are not standard. This is a big problem because it is almost impossible to find miter guides and other accessories such as sliding miter tables, etc. that will work with this saw. To make matters worse, the miter guide that comes with the saw is a joke. It is not very accurate, and it is very short. This makes it impossible to deal with anything wider than about 8"" on the table.I'm going to replace this saw on this basis alone."
5,Perfect Antidote...,"...for the holiday blahs...X-mas classics have never rocked liked this. Of particular delight is the seldom heard Christmas classic, ""Marshmallow World""...Easily my favorite Holiday collection."
2,Good product with poor shipping track record,"I ordered 3 of these, one after the other, and all came with significant chips and scratches to either the bowl or the lid. I finally called Weber and they replaced the damaged parts directly. If buying this product I would buy it in a store, not on line."
3,Not a bad kayak seat. Not great either.,"I just put this seat on as a replacement for a horrible seat that came with my ocean frenzy sit on top kayak. I have given it several tryouts this week.What I like about this seat:If you take the time and strap it down just right, it stays put where it's supposed to. I bought this kayak seat because the one I had was all over the place. Never could get it right and never could get comfortable.The Seyvlor seat is fairly stable with pretty good back support. Not as much as I hoped, but not bad.I do like the bottle holders and fanny pack pouch. I just wish they weren't behind the seat.Here's what I don't like:The Sevylor seat is not very cushiony (is that a word?) but it isn't bad. I wish it had a little bit higher back and a little more padding.Hard to get to the storage pouch and water bottle holders but I really can't complain. At least this seat has them."
1,They have been going flat in under a day,"Basically, it's like the title says. I bought two and they both go flat in under a day. So disappointed."
5,No you're not dreaming and it's rather excellent,"One of the best trance remixes of a classic song, and certainly one of the best releaseas from Lost Witness.The Minimalist remix here is my favourite on the CD.However as others have also noted, there are several producers and remixes who have put their hands on this same song with varying results, some excellent and some not up to expectations. The best version though for me remains Vengeance's which is only available on 12"". Item is now hard to find, but with some luck and ""deep Googling"" I'm sure it is obtainable."
4,"Very clear, well organized, and comprehensive","An excellent reference book for programmers who have some basic familiarity with VBA. Webb does not drown his reader in pages of useless listings or chimpanzee instructions (Go to the Menu Bar, click File, click Open, click OK, duh) that have seemed to overtake so many other training books. Instead, he provides an intelligent tour of VBA. Might be outdated, but still worth it!"
1,This isn't the book for beginners (or intermediate or ... ),"Ugh, I bought this book hoping it would explain some very simple operations for me. These are the types of operations that you would normally us SAS or Minitab or STATA for--but with the all the promise of Excel, I couldn't resist. What a mistake! Don't buy this book until you are sure it is what you want!"
4,A Must Read!,"This is a great book - I encourage all parents of teens to take a look. Not only is it filled with step by step instructions, the cute cartoon samples make it easy to follow!"
3,How to Talk So Teens will Listen & Listen So Teens will Talk,"I bought this book as it was recommended by a counselor. Some of the information was helpful and very good, but I didn't care for the author's writing style."
4,"Workable, but has a few flaws","The chess set is by and large a good one, with the pieces and board itself small but each to handle. However, there is no way to zip shut or otherwise secure the set when it is closed up--you can therefore spill your pieces everywhere. Also, surface has some creases where you fold the board, and the chess pieces don't always sit flat on the squares that are on the folds."
5,I love these guys!,"I first heard Jonasay when they opened for Live one night. Maybe it was just that they were the best of the 4 opening bands, but I was just blown away. I ordered Spare Dimes for Dust the minute I got home, and I love every minute of it. With a solid lead singer and powerful music to back him up, Jonasay has the potential to go far. Great CD...great band...try it."
3,Good if your expectations aren't too high,"I bought these speakers to allow me to listen to streaming online radio and music (including MP3) away from the computer like in the bathroom and kitchen. For music, they are not great. If I turn on the bass boost, they buzz and rattle, if I turn it off, the sound is thin. They work great for talk-type programs, though. I bought refurbished ones, so for the price, not a bad deal. I would not want to pay full price for these, however."
1,Disappointing Speakers,"Received the speakers and set them up. One speaker worked great, however, the second speaker would not work at all. Took great pains to ensure I wasn't doing anything wrong. Contacted Beach Audio, from whom the speakers shipped, and they told me to return them for credit of the speakers price, but not shipping which I can understand. BUT, I had to pay for the return shipping which was very upsetting. Beach Audio told me to reorder since they would not REPLACE them and of course the price was higher for the reordered set. NICE! Will not do business with Beach Audio again."
1,Barely receives a signal,"I tried hooking these up to both an MP3 player and a stereo receiver. I had to turn the source volume way up (which I expected) in order to get a signal but it was extremely difficult to retain that signal. Halfway through a song, the transmitter would lose the signal for whatever reason and the speakers would emit REALLY loud feedback. Definitely not what you want to hear. After fiddling with the tuning on both the transmitter and speakers and getting the same results, I am returning these."
1,DOA Two bad speakers,We live in the country so no interference excuse from neighbours.Wireless phones are in 4.7 gig band and computer wireless net in 2.4 gig band. RCA is at 900 Mhz so should work fine.First speaker out of the box has high pitched whistle but does play (not acceptable) Second speaker powers up but no reception.20ft accross open room.I was a transmission engineer in phone company so I understand these types of system.Sending it back amd will look at different system.
4,Just good common sense,"Lovely quotations regarding Love, Friendship etc. that make you feel all warm and cozy. Makes you want to pick up and read Wind, Sand, Stars and The Little Prince all over again and also look up at the stars once again with new feeling."
3,Lame,"My 4 year old newphew was into superheroes. No educational value, but not that much fun either."
4,super cool,"great attion to details, super cool story, good against evil, and alot of the choses that we make effect the life, teach love not hate!!!!"
1,I was greatly dissapointed..,"I was a fan of the original series when I was younger (and me being a dork I still am), and this series is fine for kids, but for anime lovers I would recommend saving your money. The dub sounds lazy, there's no original japanese track on it, and don't even get me started on the editing. Overall this was released and meant to pass as a children's cartoon, not an anime. If you're a fan of the original digimon series looking for a walk down memory lane look elsewhere."
4,great buy,"I bought this for my son. He was nervous that being a used item, it would have a lot of scratches and skip when played. To be truthful, I was a bit nervous too given the cheap price. The item arrived promptly and it great condition. We both were pleasantly suprised. I will deal with this seller in the future! thanks :)"
1,Pleae bon't bother me,You don't read the e-mails I have sent you regarding this purchase. All goes to prove that this is just some software sending stuff automatically. No human being to get in touch with.Thank God amazon.com is not the only one selling books on earth.
1,Searching For The Truth,"Benny Hinn Ministries (BHM) is a cultic organization. His books can be placed on a shelf next to the books of Kabbalah Centre, Scientology, est, Landmark Forum, Adidam, Ramtha, LDS, Watchtower and dozens of others. The mind is precious, don't let yours be sold or controlled."
1,Grieving the Holy Spirit,"While on the outside Benny Hinn looks quite prosperous (both healthy as well as financially), the inside of his theological system is full of dead men's bones. Just because a man is successful according to the standards of the world (i.e. the largeness of this man's ""ministry"" and even the converts who claim to be changed) does not make him a spiritual success. ""Good Morning Holy Spirit"" is so full of doctrinal errors...every true believer born of the spirit should be able to see right through it. From his corrupt view of the Trinity to the idea that God wants everyone to be prosperous, it should be made known that getting involved with Hinn's movement can be very dangerous to one's spiritual growth. For those truly interesting in having a healthy relationship with God and leaving the diet of cotton candy and Milk Duds, try something like ""Mere Christianity"" by CS Lewis. It would be so much better for your health!"
2,It's OK if you like coffee grounds in your cup,"I bought this so I wouldn't have to use paper filters. I personally do not like coffee grounds in my coffee. This filter lets some of the coffee grounds through so I get sludge at the bottom of my mug. But on a positive note, I am not wasting the rest of my #2 paper filters from the previous coffee maker I had. I now put a #2 paper filter inside of this & I have no grounds whatsoever in my coffee."
2,Content good - Presentation poor,The title gives the impression that you are going to be whisked away into that world everyone dreams about - your secret place. But in reality it doesn't quite do that. The photography is poor and the diagrams are not labeled adequately. Shame as I really wanted to enjoy this book.
2,Flights of fantasy,"1.5 Stars.I bought this book because (1) it was $2.00 and (2) I thought it would be amusing. GotG is filled with wild, unsubstantiated theories based on ""evidence"" that no one else seems to have ever seen before. Even if the book wasn't completely lacking in credability, it's not well written. I suppose that if you're already part of the ""aliens-built-they pyramids"" crowd, then this book is gospel to you and you've already slipped beyond the capacity for rational thought. For everyone else, however, this book isn't worth your time or money (unless you have a lot of both).The only reason that I didn't give it one star was that it was somewhat amusing at times.Not recommended."
5,nice putter,"For the price, this is a great putter. Long line on the back to help you line up you put. For $35 and free shipping you can go wrong."
4,Putts Great,"Great feel for the putt, easy to swing. Hits like the Odyssey 2 ball for much less money. Paint has chipped off while in the bag but hasn't affected performance and that's the only reason I don't give it 5 stars."
4,Your so right!,"Hi Hannah,You are so right! We should end the war.I'm getting tired of seeing all these reviews that don't tell anything about the doll. I mean I'd like to knowwhat the doll looks like, what the doll comes with,you know stuff like that.LENZIE:)"
1,Did not work in my Windows 7 Pro 64 bit PC,"I purchased a new PC in 12/11 with Windows 7 Pro 64 bit and realized to late that I did not order enough USB ports for all of my peripherals. I installed this card and it seemed to be okay. However, when I powered down I got a blue screen. I had to pull the plug to turn off the machine. I removed the card and restarted the PC then powered down normally and on again. My PC is healthy - just did not like this card. I have no way to tell if the card was in some way defective - but since it did see two USB devices, I believe there was no problem in that respect. Windows 7 64 bit just did like the card. I am still searching for one that will work with the installed operating system."
2,not up to snuff.,I'm a big fan of Jane Langton but found this work to be lacking in her usual Homerisms. Too much old history and not really enough up to date detecting.
3,Baking needed,"This is a nice way to taech cultural diversity , but it just isn't the same unless you bake the recipes to go with the story. It would be great for a school class lesson where different parents bring in samples of the breads. Not a good bedtime story."
3,The Anxiety Expert,"A physician who both treats and suffers from the same disorder has an interesting story to tell. Unfortunately, this story is told in a rudimentary style seemingly developed at a weekend writer's workshop. Scenes and events are recounted with little of the emotional context necessary for an enlightening read. One begins to sense that Dr Raskin's personal therapies suffered from the same limitations, depriving both her and the reader of satisfying conclusions."
5,Great insight,"Great book about a real experience with anxiety and panic. The only thing I wish is that it was longer, with more about her experience, maybe some follow up."
5,Great airplane !,This is great airplane - a lot of small details inside and outside. My 11 years old son liked it very much ! I will definitely recommend to buy it. Delivery was fast. Very satisfied !
3,"OK start, great fast-paced middle, disappointing ending","This was a very interesting novel in terms of the historical setting, and there are many colorful characters. The author is gifted at steadily building-up the story, but I found the last few chapters extremely disappointing-- not an interesting ""resolution"", and some characters, well, out of character. However, I do wish to continue reading the series."
5,Beautiful!,I bought this as a gift for a friend and it was so nice I ordered one for myself. I love this!
1,Oh boy,This really was not what I wanted. I dont think it was really explained that this was Hindu. Nice cards but cant use them . very disapointing
4,Good Read,"This book was very helpful, especially when studying women's issues around the world. I encourage any women's studies scholars to read it!"
3,Needed it for a course I was taking,"The book was purchased for a course I was taking. While some of the information seemed useful, there was a definite slant to the book that seemed to want to push the author's agenda. I don't really care much for books that make such bias seem so obvious."
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this book, which promised to be an interesting discourse on one of my favorite topics. I enjoyed parts of the book, but overall it left me disappointed. The writing was dry and tedious quite often, and I often had the impression that people who didn't already understand probability and statistics would probably not understand the brief technical explanations or equations provided. (For example, the discussion of Bayes Theorem.) But for those who do know P&S;, these explanations were not very enlightening.Still, I admire the attempt, and the authors certainly present a good deal of historical information related to P&S; in some ways."
5,Adorable - a must-have for cat-lovers,"This collection of familiar Christmas carols reworked to a feline perspective is priceless. Laurie Loughlin writes with a deft touch and a wry understanding of the feline nature, as only a cat-lover can. The illustrations are hilarious and sweet.I think my favorite is: ""Oh Come All Ye Furful"" -- it's not only very funny but perfectly captures cat-ness in lyrics such as:Oh come all ye furfulHungry and well-restedOh come ye, oh come yeTo the master bedroomandMeow, choirs of felinesMeow in expectationMeow 'til you get your momAnd dad out of bed"
4,Portrait Photography - great tips and overview,"An excellent book that covers the basics and important aspects of portrait photography. The book is broken into 5 sections; equipment, poses, studio lighting, creative lighting and shooting on location. Each sections includes topics that are covered in two to four pages - more than 45 key topics in total. The book is a broad overview with many tips and important aspects. If you are looking for detailed, technical information, or an American English grammar book, look elsewhere."
2,TOO TECHNICAL,"This book is OK, but it's not what I was looking for. It's completely techical stuff (only useful if you have your studio). Cannot be compared with general stuff such as Scott Kelby or the like."
2,Was this used by someone else?,"The model arrived today as expected but when I opened the box, the plastic packaging that kept the parts was open. There were loose bits of plastic joints and model parts all over box. It would appear as someone had taken parts out then returned the rest of the model kit. This is not good. I'm not sure if the entire model is intact or if the kit is missing parts. Feels like someone took out parts and then returned the model back to the supplier. This is not at all promising."
5,Excellent reference,"This is an excellent reference for the experienced or beginning printmaker. It would make a great textbook for an introductory course...one of those books you would have to buy, because you would use it forever!"
4,Amazing,I think it was worth for the price. The food last warm longer. The only bad part is a little heavy to care. I will buy another one soon.
5,Amazing cook book!,This book will make any man a great cook. Very unique with original recipes. It will even tell you how to make wine and distil booze.I would have come in first in a chili cook off with their recipe had I not run out of chili. I came in second because too many people came back for more.
4,Just right,"This product was better than what I expected for the price. The price is very reasonable and the product itself was nice. It's light weight but durable and it comes with the holes in back already so you can hang this on the wall too if you choose. Good size and was perfect for what you need it for and you don't have to use it just for tools and such either, it's great for most anything you want to organize. I would buy this again and again."
2,was good if it hadnt broke,i liked the product but it was broke in the back when i got it because it wasnt packaged very secruely in the box a chunk of the corner was taken out
4,Spiritual and Fun,This book is a fun way to learn about saints through the eyes of interesting people that in one way or another may relate to anyone who has ever been a part of catholisism. It is also a great guide to people interested in learning about saints in a special way. The only setback for me was that it did not include as many saints as I hoped it would.
4,review of book,"It was OK. A lot of good exercises. Except you have to haveequipment to go with a lot of the excersise, which I don't even know where to get"
3,Nice book but thought it was a DVD,"I read the ad wrong since I was expecting a dvd. Needless to say, I sent it back. Oh well."
3,An obtuse testing reference,"We've been developing a testing group and I wanted a practical reference for software testing. This is not it. The text presumes you're in an extremely mature environment (CMM 3 or higher) and have requirements, design, adequate resources, etc., etc.. I think the book needs more examples, better organization, and practical solutions to the difficulties you're likely to face in managing large-scale testing organizations to be truly effective. If you want LOTS of arcane procedures, though, and are going to work for a gov't. agency--this is your book!"
5,Helps with ADD,"My 5 year old was having trouble with ADD in preschool & we are against prescription drugs for kids so I heard about the combination of pedi activ & fish oil to help him focus. He takes 2 three times a day along with fish oil, we use Carlsons. His teachers and my husband and I are seeing big improvements! I def recommend if your child is having similar issues."
3,"Disappointing, almost cringe-making","I usually enjoy Megan Chance's stories very much, but this one just didn't do it for me. The characterizations in the beginning are just too predictable (and depressing) to get through.Check out Chance's ""A Season in Eden"" - the characters are more compelling and the situations are portrayed with more depth."
4,Leptin is the key!,"Dr. Rosedale's detailed explanation of the underlying ""hormone miscommunication"" that results in disease made complete sense. It motivated me to follow his guidance and the results are very good, even without using all the supplements he recommends. My own doctors are caring, yet they have nothing to offer but pills and more pills, all of which caused fatigue and depression. Someone recommended the website, mercola.com, and through that site I learned about Dr. Rosedale. This isn't just another diet book - it points the way to transforming how we could effectively treat and prevent disease in this country."
3,A review for Kurtag fans,"I came across this Harmonia Mundi disc as a fan of the Hungarian composer Gyorgy Kurtag, and this may rank among the most obscure recordings he has been involved in. In the main, this is a series of Gregorian chants on texts from the Old Testament ranging from Abraham to Moses performed by the Scholar Hungarian directed by Laszlo Dobszay and Janka Szendrei. Around the chants, a reader speaks a few passages. Organ preludes, interludes and postludes have been written by Gyorgy Kurtag and Csaba Kiraly.If you like Gregorian chant, you may love this. For Kurtag fans, however, I would warn that the organ interludes are not really representative of his own work. Although they use intervals from music of later times, in the main they attempt to fit the spirit of the chant rather than express Kurtag's individual style. Unless you are an obsessive completist, you needn't seek this out."
4,Overal pretty good,"Good DVD but REO aren't what they used to be Kevin Kronins voice is about done, can't carry the songs like he used to. Wish there was a DVD with the original REO members"
1,BEWARE.. DEFECTIVE RE-RELEASE...,i bought this re-release instead of the offical soundstage version and low and behold it's defective (no audio)i also bought the same copy from fryes thinking it was just a bad disc and that one was defective too. great show but buy the soundstage version
3,Too much sugar,I like REO. But there is a little too much audio sweetening going on here. Just watch the backup singers. Their vocals are piped in.
5,worth the price,This was more of a need than a want so I could back up certain things on my computer. It does the job :-) I also like the jewel cases...it keeps the disc's clean and free of dust.
1,What a piece of junk!,"I have already gone through two of these (I didn't pay for the replacement, obviously) and already need a third. They break almost instantly. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I would give it zero stars if I could."
2,Easily Breakable,I've had this headset purchased with a Uniden phone. It was fine until the cheap plastic headstrap broke. I fixed it with electrical tape but now the microphone stopped working. I can hear others but they can't hear me. There's got to be a better headset for the same or less than this cheap toy.
5,Marshmallow,This is a story about a cute little bunny that is brought to a house with a little old lady and her cat. The cat has never seen anything living other than the little old lady. At first the cat is scared of the little baby rabbit but then grows to love it. It takes a long time but eventually happens. This is a great story for rabbit lovers and cat lovers alike. You will think that the end of this story is the cutest thing ever.Josh
2,NOT the same as the original!,"This book has supposedly been reprinted from the original. I saw no indcation that this was abridged. However, I compared it to my older copy, and MANY of the wonderful descriptions have been left out. If you can find an older copyright, get it!"
5,Very nice mattress!,"After A LOT of research on crib mattresses and seeing a lot of reviews that even the ""better"" ones had issues of sagging, I *finally* found consumerreports.org crib mattress buying guide. This one met all the qualifications - inner springs had a gauge less that 15, had the border rods, multiple layers of cushioning, etc. I had previously gotten a cheaper foam one not knowing all that was involved and it was cheap for a reason - may have had good reviews but I could smash it down to nothing with one hand very easily. I wanted something that will support a baby for a long time, not sag or create dips. This one is very firm - laid on it myself. Just got it but already think it's worth the price - seems like it will give good support and last a long time."
2,Boring,"Don't even consider this film unless you're obsessed with Kim Basinger or Val Kilmer. I saw it in 1993 and again last year and I had forgotten how boring it was. Now I remember. I wondered what the heck was the purpose for making this film. Kim was on a roll that year I can remember. She'd just finished filming the remake of The Getaway with her then hubby Alec Baldwin. Now that's a good film right there. I like Kim Basinger but not in this. No one seemed to. Along with John Cusack's "" Money for Nothing "", "" The Real McCoy "" was the most overlooked film of the year. I miss 1993, but not when it comes to bad films like this. This should have never been made. Shame on them. Shame."
1,Terrible,"There is nothing to like about this wifi adapter. Installation was a headache due to issues with Windows 7, despite the assurance on the box that it works with Windows 7. I finally got it to work (it wasn't easy), but then experienced frequent drops in connection. My signal went from excellent to finding absolutely no wireless networks, and cycled continuously. ""Garbage"" is a bit too kind of a description of this product. Garbage is something you throw out and don't think about. I think about this piece of junk and get angry and feel compelled to destroy it.This stupid thing cost ~$60 at Best Buy. I went to Fry's electronics and bought a cheapo $20 card that actually works well. The ""net"" in Netgear apparently stands for ""net profit [from selling garbage at ridiculously high prices]."""
1,Broken on x64 machines,"Apparently this product has known problems with Windows 7 x64 (i.e, disconnects constantly), and Netgear just sells them anyway. I've tried both the driver fix and the power fix, and the card is still unreliable with no response forthcoming from Netgear. Avoid this unless you're running your machine in x86 mode."
2,cute...daughter loved it but it broke within the first week,"My 3 year old fell in love with it at first sight. However, it was a gift and it stopped working within a week. Since I did not have a receipt, I called the 800 number on the tag. They told me they would replace it but I had to mail it back AT MY OWN EXPENSE via a trackable method (this will cost as much as the toy) and they will send me a new one. First of all, any other company I have dealt with always sends a postage paid package to mail the product back in, secondly, my daughter is going to be hearbroken when I take her dog away. Needless to say, due to poor customer service, I will never buy nor reccomend another product from MGA Entertainment."
3,For rarities collectors only,"Viewers expecting an experience similar to the Warner Brothers release of ""How the West Was Won"" will be very disappointed by this attempt to recreate ""This Is Cinerama"".While I have no problem with the ""smilebox"" format, there is more involved in matching the three strips than was attempted here, and the optical distortion within each strip was not properly corrected, as was done on the HTWWW disc.It is commendable that an attempt was made, and it is good to have at least this version. But it is also easy to imagine a version with better optical correction.This version is good, but it could have - and should have - been better."
3,"great for carrying anything, but heavy all by itself","The vest is everything it promised to be, but it seems really heavy, without anything in it. I'm a 5'9"" female, pretty well built, and am strong enough to hold or carry whatever I want, but the vest is heavy like canvas burlap. It is vented in the back, so I don't figure it will be that hot, but it's a bit heavier than I planned on it being."
2,Big and floppy,"I thought that this bag had more substance to it, and that the material would be thicker. It feels too flimsy for its size so that it ends up not holding its shape very well and tends to sag like a hammock. It is really much longer than you would need for books and notebooks. The flap is a bit long and makes access a little difficult. I prefer a bag that you can set down, and that provides more structure. I also think the lack of support causes the bag to pull on your shoulder quite a bit. In all it was too big and floppy for me."
2,Too Big,"Be careful when buying this bag. It is much larger than it appears. I was looking for a bag to use for college for carrying around my books, and when I got this I was very disappointed. It is extremely wide, and I'm not sure what kind of textbook or laptop would be that wide. It would not be suitable for easy, on the go, carrying or biking. Be forewarned."
1,Don't buy this grill for use at home,"There is alot written about this grill's problem with regulator flow etc. I have been to Weber's site, read through the reviews of the problem, and can't get the grill above 200F because I use a regular size home propane tank. the woman on the phone from weber was nice, and walked me through the startup steps, but still a pathetic little flame was all we got. She suggested a new regulator, but since I've already replaced it once, I think I'll just junk this grill. I hear if you use the little disposables that this problem doesn't exist, but that isn't exactly sustainable, is it?there has to be a better way to engineer this grill. in the meantime, find another one if you intend to use a full size home tank."
1,Poor,"Does not light. I have followed every precautionary step, every ""turn knob slowly"" instruction, yet grill will absolutely not light. I purchased 10 pounds of carne asada for the grand voyage of this grill, only to tell my friends ""another day."" How embarrassing for both myself and Weber."
5,Simple élégance,"At first you will say O boy it is small....But once you put it in your wrist,the fit is perfect.Go to say good thing may come in small package."
3,The Harold Bloom of Cheese Writers,"Ok, I love food. I love cheese. I love books. But books about food that are based on a ""what I like is canonical"" approach are utterly unappealing. Please, humor me and make an attempt to find a theme for your book that is based on something beyond your own tastebuds, however rarefied. Tell me about the history of cheese, pick a cheese region and profile some producers, even the etymology of the word - something tangible. Simply picking some random pantheon of unassailable cheese ""gods"" doesn't help me at all. NOTE: Harold Bloom wrote the same sorts of books about capital L literature and ""which books are good"" nonsense, thus the reference for any that don't know him."
3,Cheese'n,"This is a book about cheese written like a text book from school, the kind you never really read. The knowledge is served to you as cold and tasteless like a plate of cardboard."
5,Great reference for the cheese snob in your life :),"My wife bought me this book for Christmas and I couldn't be happier. From the wonderful descriptions and histories to the expectations from each cheese, I am in 7th heaven. For anyone looking to expand their cheese knowledge, I highly recommend this book."
5,Great book for the aspiring actor,"Packed with a lot of information you can use. Unlike some books I've read, this guy actually works in the industry."
5,must read for Hitchens fans,"I don't think it is possible to understand Hitchens' writing until you understand what motivates him. He is a contrarian. So, if he is arguing a position you don't agree with as a liberal - that is the point! We don't need our views re-inforced, we need them challenged. And Hitchens does that from a Humanist perspective, which is why I value his work. I found this book to be a wonderful and enlightening read. You learn about his past, what brought him to contrarianism and why he persists as a contrarian. If you like Hitch, or just want to understand him better, read this book."
4,An excellent book to give to a young rebel in the making,"I think this is intended for people slightly younger than I am, but I still greatly appreciate Hitchens' passion and defense for being an independent thinker and for pointing out some of the pitfalls and pride that come with the territory. He had a fiercely humanistic outlook that often takes a backseat to his unreserved loathing and mockery of theism, but which is very well-represented here. This is a good book to give to a punky teenage rebel. With any luck, it will help them transition into becoming a thoughtful, sophisticated rebel down the road."
1,Lifestyle Sucks,"I bought one of these in Hawaii and it kept giving me problems..I changed the tuner twice. After I moved to Atlanta, it had to be repaired every 2 years..Often it would not play in my house but would play ok in the store..Very strange..I dont think I will buy overpriced Bose stuff again..Now I have a JBL unit which works wonderfully.."
5,Nice little knife.,"I've carried more pocket knives that I care to admit in my lifetime, but I've never carried anything from the swiss army/victorinox line since I was in high school. I figured I'd give this one a chance since it seemed to get glowing reviews everywhere I look as a nice EDC blade.It's handy, thin, lightweight, and just the right size to avoid that second look by an authority figure. If only it had a blade lock; I'd be ordering a second one."
5,classic Aretha,"one of the Greatest Artists and most versatile Musical Artists ever. Aretha Franklin truly can sing/sang and doing Gospel Music is where you truly feel her depth.the arrangements and overall stylings compliment Aretha Franklin's range and stylings. if you really want to hear Aretha uncut and in full uncut then you have to hear singing Gospel Music as the songs on here. she makes you feel ""Amazing Grace"". Incredible talent."
1,Aretha Franklin Gospel Greats,"I was disappointed with this CD because I like her music,This one did nothing for me at all.Chic Lady"
2,It Broke!!,"I have had this mouse for almost a year now, and a couple of months ago it started flaking out, not always clicking when I clicked. Then I had to start unplugging and re-plugging it to get it to turn on. Eventually it just stopped turning on all together. We tested other USB devices on my laptop, and found that it was indeed a mouse problem. We even tried the mouse on several different computers. I'm working on contacting Kensington to replace it, but so far I've only recieved an e-mail parroting back to me my original complaint."
2,spotty performance,"It works OK, except for when the pointer suddenly jumps to the other side of the screen. Why does it do this? I have no idea. It seems to happen about every 10 minutes on average. My other Kensington mouse (full size) doesn't have this problem, so I expect this is a problem with the Pocket Mouse in particular. I'm going to replace it with something more stable. (I'll just save it for use as a back-up mouse.)"
3,Just OK,The chicka chicka boom boom story is great but the rest is actually kind of boring. My 2 year old woot sit through it.
3,Good sound but not compatible with my phone,Incompatible with Cingular 2125. Couldnt get the sound in both the ears. Good sound when I tried with other mp3 players.
1,Doesn't work in stereo mode.,Bought this for my cell phone so I can have hands free and stereo mp3 access. The first one didn't work in stereo just mono. The company promptly sent me another one ( didn't want he broke one back). Got #2 and the same thing was wrong. I tried it in 3 different cell phones and even 2 different 2.5mm house phones with no luck. You get what you pay for but you should get what is advertised ( Stereo ). Company was top notch though.
1,Frightfully dull,"I was hugely disappointed in a book that made the presidency of, of all people, Teddy Roosevelt seem dull. Perhaps I've been spoiled by historical authors like Doris Kearns Goodwin, whose writing style captures the spirit of her subjects. This book was dry, dry, dry."
1,Terrible Novelization of the Classic Whoopi Goldberg Movie,I'm up to page 247 and so far there hasn't been any talking dinosaurs. Skip this book - see the movie instead!
4,Why Can't You Be More Like Your Cousin?,"Each president, no matter how strong or weak on election day, grows into office. Theodore Roosevelt is no exception. The best aspect of this book for me was Morris' ability to showcase this transition from man of action to statesman and leader.We will never again be as innocent or brash, as casually racist or inhumane, as we were when we had Teddy in the White House. But if you'd like to see that era come alive again, and see how we are now what Teddy forged for us then, read this book.All that said, I have much more admiration for his four-term cousin, and wonder why we haven't carved him on Mount Rushmore yet. In his new memorial in Washington, he looks so alone there..."
5,Fun reading,"This series on TR is fun reading. The subject is a larger than life character and Morris really brings him to life on the page.It's a shame we don't have leaders like this any longer.Sure there might be things to criticize about TR by todays standards, but by the standards of my feeble knowledge of history there's nothing to criticize about this book. It should be required reading for all American citizens."
2,The Writing Gets in the Way,"There must be better biographies of Theodore Roosevelt out there. I read this book in spite of Edmund Morris' annoying overwrought writing style. The book could have used much more aggressive editing. Unfortunately, the historic larger than life persona of Theodore Roosevelt gets buried under Morris'penchant for introducing excessive and distracting detail."
4,"Good, but not as good as ""The Rise""","I started this book right after reading ""The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt"" by Morris. While I was riveted to the first book, this one took a little while longer to read. So much detail was given to the politics of his office and the bills that were introduced, that it made for somewhat dry reading in parts. Very informative, but not as thrilling as his life prior to his presidency."
5,Must Read,"This book is a must read for Catholics and anyone who can appreciate realistic, human portrayals of these extraordinary men. Everyone should invest in a hard-cover copy to add to their collection. I highly recommend this well-researched, fascinating read."
3,Rohmer - love him or leave him,"There's no middle ground when it comes to Eric Rohmer films. You either love them or you hate them. If you hate them, there's no sense reviewing them for others. For those of us who love them, maybe we should rate the films on the Rohmer Scale of 1 to 5. ""1"" for your least favourites and ""5"" for your most favourites.Having said that, I'd say this is a mid-level Rohmer film. But, still Rohmer, still unexplicably wonderful."
3,Women in the Bible,this is a helpful tool in teaching and learning about he women mentioned in the Bible. I have used it in lesson preparation and study.
5,Great Women's Bible study book!,"I ordered this book for our Women's Bible study (we're called the Bible Babes!) and I will warn you - if you are thinking about ordering this book for the same purpose I HIGHLY recommend it but DO NOT recommend the workbook. I ordered the book and received the workbook instead by mistake and thought maybe I would keep it as a supplement to the book but after comparing the two they are identical. The only difference is that the workbook has LESS information, Bible readings & discussion questions than the book (why pay close to the same price for less?). I did like how the workbook had lines for your notes, but I am happy to keep a spiral if it means that I have more verses to read and questions to discuss. I HIGHLY recommend this book! (and do NOT recommend the workbook) Hope this avoids going through the trouble I went through. Enjoy it!! (By the way Amazon- I'm still waiting for a refund on the workbooks I returned...)"
1,A waste of money,I just threw this seat out. This seat slides back and forth on the toilet and has difficulty closing. It arrived without the deodorizer and the company was little help so I had to purchase that separately and although it lights up and makes a noise no sent is released. Don't waste your money on this
1,"A joke, signally unfair","This biography of one of America's greatest writers is a colossal joke. Atlas takes pot shots at Bellow througout the book and actually attempts to psychoanalyze him several times! Instead of focusing on the brilliant works Bellow has produced, Atlas whacks Bellow over the head time and again for being a womanizer.Fortunately, a couple of knowledgeable and appreciative authors have come forward and set the record straight concerning Bellow's unmatched contribution to American letters. Most recently, Charles Simic wrote a fabulous appreciation of Bellow in the New York Review of Books (May 31, 2001, ""The Thinking Man's Comedy""). A recent Harper's magazine piece (February or March 2001 issue, I believe) also takes Atlas to task for producing such a pile of dung.I refer Bellow fans and other interested readers to the above-mentioned articles."
3,Brilliant study of Bellow is unilluminating,"James Atlas has complained that the reviews for this biography have been heterogenous, noncommittal and inconclusive, as well as self-contradictory. For my part, I found this distinguished and important work to be mediocre and insignificant. It is prolix, intelligent, concise, superficial, obtuse and profound. But I could be wrong."
1,don't buy it,"these are good speakers for low volume, once you crank up the volume the sounds of different quality can appreciated. and i'm sure they originate from the speakers. the only good thing is that, i paid $30 for the set."
2,Moon's misinformation,"I hope Wright researched other cities better than he did mine, because he lists a restaurant that closed in 1998, an inn that closed in 1998, industry that has 'recently sprouted' (but has been here since 1966), a park at an address that does not exist, and a golf tournament at the wrong course. I'd be afraid touse this guide for other cities!!!"
2,Rather Disappointing,"This book plays out a little more like a movie of the week. It took me a long time to finish, as it really never made me want to continue reading it. I strived on, though, and finished it after a few weeks. I was expecting a little more in regards to the Mason thing. The book certainly gives that impression, but it really doesn't follow through. I didn't feel much for the main character, and the supporting characters were rather........annoying. I don't like to write long, overblown reviews where people like to set-up the plot. Read the inside cover and decide for yourself, but I would only recommend it if you have nothing else to enjoy."
3,Dissapointing & Disjointed,"I think it is best for me to preface this review by saying that I am a huge Brad Meltzer fan. Unfortunately, I was severly dissapointed by this book. The book feels fragmented and I never felt that we knew the tru motivations of the villians. All in all, this book paces well, but will leave you feeling like time could have been better spent in other ways"
2,Protagonist is weakest character,"If you like really weak, confused, stupid and again weak protagonists this book is for you. It reminded me of The Big Lebowski; the guy gets thrown into a weird set of circumstances and really doesn't do anything except go with the flow. It all pans out and, in the end, he is a hero.The Big Lebowski was funny, this book isn't.Read something else."
4,Very good and solid book,"I picked this up after starting The Terrorist, which was not so good. It was action packed, had interesting plot lines and was a fun to read."
1,Rip off of symbol,"I purchased Brad Meltzer's ""The Book of Fate"" because I was looking for something to read and the cover had the image of a square and compass. As a Freemason, I am familiar with the square and compasses and was interested in seeing his fictional interpretation of Masonic working and fate. What a rip off. Meltzer is attempting to follow the success of Dan Brown. Yes, I know that this book was published well before ""The Lost Symbol"" but after at least after one of Brown's other books.My point is that the Masonic Fraternity is mentioned only a few times and one instance is a list of men who served our country and were Masons. There is also a character who has a Masonic tattoo. Congratulations Meltzer for getting me to spend my hard earned case on a book that is written on a low reading level and to misrepresent a symbol of my Fraternity."
2,By way of John Grisham???,"I really like Brad Meltzer but I fear he's on Grisham's road - he's finding it harder and harder to find a good story to tell.I'm not quite finished with this one yet and I will finish it - it's not so bad that I don't want to find out the ending but I have to say - the characters suck. Every one of them. Wes is a buffoon. He shakes, twitters, stutters, trips and hits everything in whatever room he's in - I'll be very disappointed if he doesn't turn into a man at some point. And for Pete's sake - hasn't anyone ever heard of plastic surgery? I would think the President would have paid for it seeing as how he's the President and probably has good medical insurance. If Wes is truly the Elephant Man after the shooting - do something about it!Sorry to be picky - but I can't stand it when not one character in a book is worth rooting for."
3,"good read, but not up to his usual standards.","I have loved the other Meltzer books I have read (First Counsel, Zero Game, ect.) This one starts out on a tear like the others, but he did let it go too long. The book is over 500 pages and if he would have cut it down to 400 he would have had a FIVE STAR HIT on his hands!!! Either way it is still better than anything written by Paterson, or Dan Brown. Metlzer just gets a little bogged down in the details on this one. Definitely check out his other works."
5,best so far,"This title is the authors best (since inner circle) and calls into question those thoughts of destiny. As always, a good fast read for weekends on the road."
2,"Bad plot, bad characters","The heart of the book is the big conspiracy, which is dull as sand. Nobody cares about something that. If it were true, congress would be outraged and that's about. By the middle of the book, I can't stand the main character, who seems to missed the growth process for his back bone. He makes no decisions, whines and interacts with predictable 1 dimensional characters."
2,"Confusing, difficult to follow plot","This is one of the few books that I have read to the end and am still not sure what actually happened. The author introduces and develops a plot line about freemasons and their political impact, only to have the plot line completely disappear. The book discusses a group of conspirators called The Three and later The Four and I am still not sure what they they were conspiring to do and why it required someone to fake their own death (in the middle of an assassination attempt on the president, no less!). I agree with an earlier reviewer who said that this is an unfinished book that was somehow published."
2,"Did not need any ""non-Asia"" songs.......","Yes, we all know that members of this band were in several other bands over the years. We just didnt need 5 songs on this 2 disc set devoted to that fact.This would have been MUCH better with just Asia music."
2,Where is the piano?,"I thought I was buying just the lovely solo music of George Shearing that I listen to to put me to sleep at night. I didn't expect a hodgepodge of vibses, drums, male and female vocals and piano that was just audible every once in awhile. I turned it off and the thought still kept me awake. Next time I will read the reviews and not just depend on the title. I'm hiding this one.Dick"
3,Damaged Product,"Although outside package undamaged, the CD plastic container inside was broken in several places. CD played OK, so did not care to go thru hassle to return, and kept it, altho it's difficult to store with my others."
3,Dinosaurs on Earth and in Space!,"The first is a dull movie about an encounter with dinosaurs on Earth but the second one is rather interesting: Astronauts (or better: Cosmonauts, because the director uses a lot of space footage from a russian SF movie) lands on a planet to encounter among other things - you guessed it - Dinosaurs. Enjoyable. (And if only for the footages) But NOTE: they are recorded in the EP mode!"
3,Good sound,This machine has features and sound way above what is available at big box stores.The bad is that the CD reader did not handle shipping and I had to send it back twice. Vocopro responded but the second time I paid outbound freight.
2,Solid product hurt by WindowsCE support,"Moved up from a Palm pilot profesional to the E-105. The product was very solid, the color excellent. The size was a little large but given the features a good tradeoff. I needed to sync the E-100 with two different PCs (Windows98 & WindowsNT). The sync with NT worked flawlessly but I was never able to sync (using Active Sync 3.0) on my Compact Presario (Windows98/Outlook2000). Customer service was never able to resolve the problem as to why it would not sync on Windows98/Outlook2000. Without the sync ability the usefullness of the product was eliminated and I had to go back to the Palm. Seems to be a good product with older software/systems (WindowsNT 4.0/Outlook98) but seems to lack compatibility with Windows98/Office2000 products. Most likely a WindowsCE problem, not a E-100 problem but the two are a package deal."
4,Win 2K,"My boss and I just upgraded to Windows 2000. During install, his CE device was found and configured automatically. I had to set up my Palm from scratch, which was a pain.If you are considering going to Win2K soon, I would choose this device over a Palm."
5,Terrific Book,"This book is well written and lets you see the life through an abused woman's eyes. This is a great book for someone who would like to learn more about abusive relationships. It describes the heartache, the pain, and most imporantly the hope."
4,Helpful,"Readers who have or are experiencing domestic abuse will find this book helpful in knowing that they are not alone. The book is written as though the victim is talking directly to you, suggesting that you learn from her experience."
5,Fiestaware has brought a party to my kitchen,"I am new to the Fiestaware fan club-that said, it is beautiful, durable and ever so cheerful! The colors are spectacular and the shapes perfect....the mugs are the most comfortable I have ever used. This may have been my grandmother's Fiestaware but I have made it mine!"
3,interesting book,"Nice book, interesting to read about this project and the stories of the people portrait in it. However, the layout and design don't complement the story."
5,So sweet and Fresh!!!!!,"I am in love with this cologne, although listed as a cologne for babies, I use it as a light fragrance. I buy cotton pads used for make-up, and saturate the pad and rub all over I want fragrance. It is so fresh and clean smelling, especially on a hot summer day. I love baby powder, baby lotion smells to begin with and this is great for layering with those products. For $2-$3 you can not beat this for a great smell. I could buy this by the CASE I love it so much!!!!"
3,good,"it smell like johnson and jonhson lotion. that it. but that is the reason i bought it. eventhough its not the best baby perfume, but i will continue to but it when mines run out."
3,Great phone till it died in 3 months,Best featured phone ever owned till got up one day and it was completely dead. Just exchanged for same model and works great (so far)
4,Heart whelming story,"I got this book as a package deal with a book club. The beginning was kind of dry but I stuck with it.I really enjoyed this book, it is well written and the story is original. I wish the ending was a little bit more developed.Amy, a journalist is on a path to find her mother, reconcile with her boyfriend, help a man who never knew his father, and still write her political article on time.Although I felt the ending was a little rushed I still found this to be an enjoyable book to read and I recommend it to all those that do not get bored easily with dry beginnings."
2,"Dull, Dull, Dull","This was the first Susan Isaacs novel I've read and it will probably be the last. I felt the author was trying to be funny throughout the book--and failing miserably. The main character was boring, the ending managed to be both predictable and implausible, and the whole book was utterly forgettable. Maybe Isaacs has done better, but judging from Any Place I Hang My Hat, I don't get the hype about her."
1,Ms. Isaacs latest novel - the only one I have not liked,I have read all of Susan Isaacs' books and loved them all. This one was a great disappointment. I could not figure out why I should care about her or her unfortunate family.
4,Eager to read more,"The modern 'chick lit' genre is one I usually avoid, so while I've heard of Isaacs, I never cared to read her books. But I'd heard good things about this one, and thought I'd try it. I am very glad I did. Yes, like most 'chick lit' it is girlish, dealing with issues like dating and work and juggling it all. But its also about how a woman discoveres who she is by discovering who her family was, and who shaped her, the family who bore her, or the family who raised her. Isaacs goes through the whole process of the search in the way one would expect a journalist like the narrator to do. The scenes where she meets her grandmother and later her mother were class acts; not mauldin, certainly not overyly sentimental or sentimental at all. These scenes were written with such realism that I decided I really must read more of this author's work. Not sure where to start, but it looks like I have some enjoyable reading ahead of me."
3,She's done better,This went many places in a meandering fashion. It's entertainment value was in the trademark Susan Isaacs wry and pungent observation/verbalize that which we don't talk about style. The somewhat surprise ending was a relief.
2,Misses by a mile,"I've enjoyed other books by Susan Isaacs and, as a ex-New Yorker, continue to enjoy her accurate eye and ear for Jewish New York nuance. But ""Any Place I Hang My Hat"" was a big disappointment. Predictable plot. Too heavy (and obvious) on election politics. And way too many self-congratulatory comments from Amy, the main character. But my biggest beef with this book is that Amy is supposed to be pushing thirty, yet her professed youth doesn't come off convincingly. Throughout, I kept ""hearing"" the voice of the middle-aged writer trying to sound young. Maybe it's time for Isaacs to take a rest and contemplate a new writing direction."
1,Too mallow and boring book... You have permission to stop in the middle...,"It is my first book of the author Susan Isaacs and I got to read (actually listen to audio book) base on the recommendation of my wife. The book starts nice and interesting with the quest of Amy Lincoln to meet her mom, her relationship with her boyfriend John, her friend Teddi, and the Fiasco around Freddy Corrasco. This is how it starts, continues and ends with not much ups and down in between."
3,Buy used,"Ok, it's not the best of movies but it was ok. Very predictable at points. We had fun predicting next thing and were right most of the time...but not always.Eric Roberts was great. The girl who played his wife can't act. Dean stockwell was as expected. All in all glad I bought used and didn't pay full price....but not bad on a snowy evening with nothing else to do."
5,a songwriter dream book,"This is the fun and simple way to learn rock and roll rhythm guitar. It contains some great rhythmic patterns to inspire any guitar player/songwriter. The pattern are broken into 4-bar and 8-bar progressions. Most songs use a 8 bar progression with a 4-bar chorus followed by the same 8 bars and then a solo section and an outtro. thus, this makes a great songwriter manual, just add lyrics.Mixing and matching patterns will really get your creativity flowing. There is even a section of famous rock patterns with song examples. Chord diagrams are above the staff but bear in mind, you can always use other chords too.The beginner can benefit from this book too because of the easy to use format and the ""how to use this book"" lessons.This is a country edition available by the same author that I am quite sure is formated the same way as this one. I think I will get that book next...cheers"
4,Zu Warriors Knock Off?,"This is a fantastical, cheezy martial arts adventure featuring sped up action, lots of wire work and second rate animation. In a word: ""nutty."" Made the same year as Zu Warrior's, this looks like a fast knock-off. It's wonderful if you don't care about tracking the plot and can embrace the style. There are lots of guilty pleasures imbeded in Asian film fare, particularly around the early 80's. This film, Holy Flame of the Martial World, ranks up there with the best (whatever happened this stuff? More fun than CGI, to be sure.)"
2,"They're fine, but avoid buying them from J&R",J&R packs them so poorly that over half of them were shattered beyond repair upon arrival.
1,You get what you pay for,"I would recommend another brand, as the quality of this jewel case is very poor. Extremely flimsy (two of ten cracked in shipping), very cheesy product. I would not store valuable projects in these."
1,Not very imaginative,"I bought this book hoping to find new, fun ideas for day to day activities for my one year old. I found nothing new or imaginative at all in the book. Most of the suggestions I already knew about. There were lyrics to songs, but no music -- not very helpful if you don't know the tune. I was so disappointed I returned the book. If you have half an imagination (and I probably have less than that), you already know everything in this book...."
2,Nothing you don't already know,"Although I've pulled a handful or original ideas from this book, overall it's nothing I didn't know already. It literally lists the words to the songs ""Mary Had A Little Land"" and ""Old McDonald Had A Farm"". I have pulled some fun art projects out of this book, but I wouldn't recommend spending money on it."
2,VHS Copy,"I love the band and its music. But I'm quite unhappy with the sound and the video quality as well of most of the videos. They just make a copy of a vhs master.At least they could have remaster a little bit the sound or try to clean the images. I just can't stand looking of those videos like this. I'm a rookie in video editing but I could have done better than the producers of this compilations.Some rareties, full collection of official videos, awesome for die hard fans. But if you have invested in a high tech TV or in a nice sounding home theater, you will be dissapointed with this dvd."
4,Good for the $,"I like this little scope a lot. I have it mounted on my Ruger 10/22. The rings that came with it wouldn't stay in place , even with the light recoil of my .22. After the first outing, I went ahead and ordered some weaver rings that uses allen bolts instead of thumb screws and it held perfectly for 100 rnds yesterday at the range. It was easy to zero in-take a few shots, adjust, shoot a few more, etc. 10 rounds and it was consistant bulls at 25 yds(max at the range I was at). Overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase."
4,Good product for the price,"Pros: Inexpensive, decent quality, works wellCons: Mount was slightly twisted and difficult to get seated into the grooves on my gun.I was able to sight this in and run a couple hundred rounds through with no problems."
3,Decent cheap option.,"This scope is a good bargain, and I'm pretty accurate with it mounted on a 10/22.The parallax is a bit annoying, and eye relief isn't great.Accuracy is good, though, so it's a good bargain scope if you don't have the cash for a more expensive model."
4,Does not work,"I purchased this for my son-in-law and it does not work, I have a similar model made by Estate that works just fine. This Legacy model is junk."
5,Best for Certain Objectives,"Not a full review, but some key points: This is a terrific TV. (I own it.) Many consider it to be the best tube TV on the market. There is a new 40"" version that is out so consider the 40"" prior to buying the 36"". Each weigh over 225 lbs. If you can spend more money, want a smaller footprint and can stomach some of the other deficiencies, move up to plasma screen tvs. The 36"" wega xbr450 is regularly sold for 20% below list, so look around and bargain."
2,First responder,"For the most part the book is very educational & easy to follow. Although there are many misspelled words, wrong or conflicting answers. Also, many topic areas taught aren't the way it is in the ""real"" world. To me it didn't look like the auther did much proof reading prior to it being published. Hopefully, there'll be a better book on the market soon."
5,A book which truly allows you to master Visual Basic.,"This is an excellent tutorial and reference for the development of web applications using Visual Basic. The author must be commended on both the thoroughness and depth of the content covered, and for using an array of examples, which clarify difficult or complex topics. The companion CD is a great reference tool in that it has a majority of the source code used in the book, and also explains several topics in more detail- such as FTP sites and POP3 servers. The combination of both the book and CD will allow even a novice or beginner web developer to create professional looking and functional web sites and applications."
2,Mis-leading title,"This book is a great handgun review book and well written. However, if you are looking for information on defensive handgun use, you should look elsewhere. If you want to read about handguns from knowledgeable person buy this book. If you want a book to assist with defensive handgun use, find another title."
1,THIS IS NOT A DIARY!,"This is NOT a diary. It is a NARRATIVE of a diary. What you get is the editor's narrative of a diary kept by someone else. So you do NOT get to read the original words penned by the person who actually experienced the journey. Instead, you get someone else's narrative (their words) of the diary. So, therefore, you are not buying a DIARY but a NARRATIVE. Big difference."
3,Works alright.,"Just putting the finishing touches on a Halloween costume. Everything about this camo kit feels inexpressive, but then, so's the price, so that's fair. Gets the job done without really impressing me."
3,My mistake,I sold it. Thought it was the dog alarm. Otherwise it was really cute.My daughter had asked for one that woke her up barking so I then bought the one with the alarm.
1,AMAZON is INCORRECT IN DESCRIPTION,THESE METRX FOOD BARS HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A GOOD WHILE. THEY ARE NOT LOW CARB AND NOT SUGAR FREE!!!! THERE IS ABOUT 34 GRAMS OF CARBS IN THEM (AS MUCH AS A CANDY BAR). PLEASE CHECK THE ACCURACY OF YOUR DESCRIPTIONS!
2,So so,"Most of the book was just different spellings of the same name. It starting getting a little annoying reading page after page of the same name. To me it did not offer a wide variety of names to choose from. Mostly just had all the classic names. I was looking for something a little more than plain jane names like Sara, John, Michael,etc."
2,Standard,"If you're hoping for unique names, this is not the book for you. The book obtained mostly traditional names . Was hoping for some new ideas."
2,"OK if you need to know 22 ways to spell ""Brittany""","I found this book disappointing. The only way Lansky can claim 15,000 names is because he counts various, often silly, spellings as separate names. Is it really necessary to have ""Nattalie"" or ""Pamula""?"
3,Updates are sooooo sloooow,I wonder why this program needs to update itself every day and then takes 1/2 hour or more (on a cable internet connection no less) to download the files. I can't believe the programmers are writing that much new updated files every single day. And then after you download the updates you have to manually click through to install them. At least it could do this automatically and in the background. It's basically a pain in the a**. I also run other antivirus software and that program downloads and updates itself in 10 seconds.
4,CLOTHES DO MAKE A DIFFERENCE,"Shakespeare said that fashion wears out more apparel than the man. This may well be true and, according to author Perrot, clothing can also reflect a culture's sociology, thus revealing beliefs, values, and hopes.This delightful and engrossing peek into the closets of the bourgeoisie, those who dressed in opposition to popular clothing worn by workers or peasants, is rich in historic information and charmingly illustrated.Perrot charts the rise of the ready-made fashion industry in Paris, and traces how the worldwide passion for shopping was born.The author notes that when department stores opened in the middle of the nineteenth century in Paris, shoppers were offered much more than clothing - they were given the opportunity to adopt a lifestyle. Have we changed so very much?- Gail Cooke"
5,The Prophet speaketh!,"Having read both books, and having gone through some similar experiences, I'd have to say that Rollins is without question one of the most powerful writers of this age, and perhaps of any age.Whether you can relate to his tales or not, the way it is all laid down will make it very clear to the reader what it is like to experience mind-bending mental anguish. All of his books are excellent reads, but thus far none have been more powerful."
1,AChhh!!!,"The WORST Spanish textbook I have ever used! The layout is nice, but the exercises, in most cases, do not even relate to the material being covered in that particular tema. The accompanying workbook is even worse. I have never seen a language book offer exercises before lessons at the beginning of a chapter, and this one does it before nearly all. If you need this for a class, be ready to deal with some headaches."
4,Nice small router,"When my unit arrived I was a little concerned about cracks on some of the clear plastic accessory pieces, but these have not developed into a problem. The router seems powerful enough for the light jobs I'm using it for and it's a heck of a lot easier to manage than my big old Craftsman router.I will say it is not a ""plunge"" router as I think of it. You can leave the base adjustment loose and lower the mechanism while it's running, but there's no depth stop or spring return. You'd do better to set the router up normally and just lower the whole shebang to the work surface, which seems practical with a unit this small. (I haven't tried it like that.)I find the small size very useful and it runs smooth. I am using router bits from my full-size router without issues. The storage case is nice touch. They even include spare brushes."
2,What?!,"Donde esta ""Tu Carcel""?! That's the first song that comes to MY mind when I hear the name Los Bukis. My mother would be so dissappointed...."
5,Great Modern Rock Album,"This is the band for the new mellinum. From beginning to end, they take you on a thrill ride through all elements of Rock and Roll. It starts you on a upbeat, Pop rock note, and by the end of the album you feel the anquish and true feelings in which these guys seemed to be holding back in the beginning. The title ""Coming Down"", explains it all, and after going through the whole album once, you'll want that fresh, upbeat sound again, and throw the album on repeat. I cannot wait for there next album, I have a feeling that its going to be a Industery Moving album. These guys are off to a good start, and it will only get better in time."
1,"TITLE IS WRONG, PICTURE IS WRONG","This is not a ""Russian Infantry and Tank Set""It is a ""Russian Infantry and Tank CREW Set"". The tank you see in the picture is not included. I will be happy to alter my rating once the product listing is updated to reflect the manufacturer's actual title. I've no idea where the image came from, it is not the image used by the manufacturer."
2,For Older Kids and/or Adults,"The title of this product is ""1/48 WWII Russian Infantry & Tank Set"", however that is not correct. There is no tank included. This information (lack of tank) is provided in the description, but I missed it. The ""& Tank"" part of the title should really be deleted. Also, there is A LOT of assembly required, and the resulting figures look like they will be very small--much smaller than the standard green army figures that kids play with. I ordered this for my son's 9th birthday and he was very disappointed when he opened up the box and saw all those itsy bitsy little pieces that needed to be glued together. This is for people who are into building models, not for kids who are just wanting different types of army guys in their play collection."
5,1/48th scale = 48 times the fun!,"Purchased this item for my nephews, along with some M-80 firecrackers (I didn't get the M-80's from Amazon though). The boys (3, 7, 9) all had hours of fun placing the soldiers in compromising positions (don't ask, don't tell), and lobbing the M-80's at the tank and infantry formations.Highly recommended for any kids interested in re-enacting famous military battles.Only downside was that the toys were not very resistant to our homemade napalm solution."
3,it a nice system,"But if u are action movie fans this system is not for u it lacks the power. if u do buy it up grade the cube speaker to the book shelf speaker like the 301 V or 201 V. this system is for those who are a Romance or Love movie fan it will fit all there needs. and those who are looking for a good system with speaker that u cant see bose will fit it. but u can buy other system at better prices from sony, Kenwood, JBL and have good sound just like bose. Look this system is alright but not great for the price and people like myself who love action movies."
2,New becomes used?,"Just a bit confuse by this company product's description. Does NEW mean the package opened and have scratch on it? Although it is works, I totally lost my joy. Anyway, it maybe an ""exceptional"" case, but I won't buy from this company again."
2,Disappointment,"I found this book unreal and unromantic. This is the story of the love of two middle-aged people (the heroine was 38 years old and the hero 42), a thing that makes the plot ordinary. The descriptions were monotonous and the outcome was not really sensual. The fact that the heroine was widowed at an early age and isolated herself for 15 years after the death of her husband makes her look boring and the whole plot even more unrealistic. Reading this book you realize that there is no climax. At no point does the book take you away."
3,worked ok...but I am sure there is better stuff out there,"Ok, I have tried a lot of stuff to stop the mass exodus of my head fur...and some things have worked better than others. This product I am giving a mixed review. First, the good: The pills did stop the exodus of my remaining hair when taken regularly.Now for the bad: I did not notice any real regrowth and, like others have said, the pills can really dry you out. When I lived in Denver, I could hardly open my mouth in the morning without tearing something open. The pee color change did not bother me, though. As for the liquid...it was a waste of money. It was gooey and smelled odd, made my thin hair look even thinner by plastering it all to my head or sticking all the hair together, messed up my pillows...ick.So...my verdict...I am going to try something else...but keep the pills as a backup. At least they kept me from losing more hair."
2,Effectiveness of Procerin,I am still a little skeptical about this product. I have used it for almost 6 months regularly now and my hair still falls plenty of it. I will use it for another 6 months and then re-evaluate.
1,Completely Useless,"i took this for more than 30 days, and all I got from it is more tendency of erections. This didn't really do anything for me since I don't have sex! lol"
5,"Great cookbook and storybook, too!","This book is great - it provides interesting stories, history facts, and quips about soup. Great recipes, too!"
5,"IF THERE WAS A 10 STAR RATING, THIS IS IT!!!",wow wow wow! this cd/dvd set is a DEAL! I 'm totally engrossed with it now...this is the one to buy if you want this awesome musical experience..My mom always loved him ..and NOW I DO! Wow !bringit on
5,The Greatest Voice of a Lifetime,"You know, I never met him, I only have all of his music and wish everyone else did too. Somtimes you have to trust strangers and their opinions about certain things,for example Engebert's vocal superiority. The guy is the absolute Greatest and this DVD will prove to all that this stranger can be trusted. Buy it.Someday it will creep into your mind and then you will wish that you could sing. He makes the world want to sing. But try to sing with him and then you will know I mean. You can't because you would rather listen to that big burgundy voice.Edward J GibbonsLiyyje silver NJ 07739"
5,"A wonderful, hysterical movie!","I rank this movie in my top ten of all time! Could you go 24 hours without telling even the tiniest lie??? See how this constraint can affect someone as charismatic as Jim Carrey. I laughed so hard that I had to watch the movie again to catch the parts I had missed! The plot of this movie and Carrey's actions are a little silly at times, but the storyline is completely believable and highly entertaining with Carrey in the lead role. I wasn't a Carrey fan at all until I saw this film. It's the first movie he did that I didn't think was incredibly stupid. The Truman Show, which followed Liar Liar, was okay, but this movie was Carrey's best performance by far."
5,An Awesome Film!!!,"Jim Carrey is awesome and extremely hilarious as a lawyer named Fletcher Reede, who lies constantly to his son, his co-workers, and at court. When he doesn't show up for his son, Max's 5th birthday, Max makes a wish that for a whole day, his dad couldn't lie. Throughout the whole next day, Fletcher tries to lie, but he can't. When he tells the truth, it sometimes get him into trouble. If you love comedy, and Jim Carrey, you'll love LIAR LIAR!!!"
3,"Silly, silly fun.","Liar Liar starring Jim Carrey was another hit for the mega star. His pyshical comedy is evident in this comedy, he just knows how to work his face and body. This film isn't perfect but it's fun and harmless. Enjoy!"
4,Funny,The greatest sketch comic creates a masterpiece. For the most part family friendly. I would check it out for sure.
4,liar liar,"how can peole give a five star to a four star oh well some peole like bad food some like good food. some cant tell the difference,this is a four star comedy"
4,Every Lawyer's Nightmare,"5/10/03 Very funny video showing the ""dad"" from the personal side(extra complications for the divorced when kids are involved) and the workplace(the cynical world of lawyers)."
5,Just barely family viewing but very funny,"Great movie, Jim C seems to make very silly but entertaining movies, they are what they are people, just chill out and enjoy, he does things that we all wish we could do in public but can't, true escapism. However, his movies almost always have one scene or a couple of lines that (easily could be deleted) push the classification boundary rather than making it a truly 'family' movie experience. I personally think it is unnecessary but they are always there. Having said that though if you have tweens and teens then sitting with them through this is a fun time and I suppose the older kids don't feel like they are having to sit through a 'kids' movie. Anyway if you relax and realise its supposed to be hammy over the top silliness then you'll probably laugh out loud, and who doesn't want a bit of that!?"
5,JIMS BEST SO FAR,I THINK THIS MOVIE WAS VERY FUNNY AND THEY PICKED THE PERFECT ACTORS FOR THIS MOVIE...DO NOT EAT OR DRINK WHILE WATCHING THIS MOVIE
4,"Silly tale of telling the truth. Funny, good lessons!","I'm not particularly enamored with the Ace Ventura/Cable Guy side of Jim Carrey.In this movie, he lets a little of that silliness out, and still manages to make this comedy feature some dramatic life lessons.Honesty is the best policy. How many kids haven't wished for total honesty from their parents? This is a movie that will make you rethink the 'Santa Claus' fibs, the 'Easter Bunny' fibs, and so on. Of course, my kids bring me their teeth, and tell me how much the tooth fairy should be depositing under their pillow that night only because we giggle... they've known all along who it was.I like the truth message. I like the love lost/love regained message.I like the depth of the emotions in here, the height of hilarity, and hey, the movie was entertaining enough to see again and again.Get it. Watch it with the kids. Heck, watch it alone with yer sweetheart because it's just so touching."
1,JIM CARREY CAN'T ACT,"This is yet another Jim Carrey movie that features his terminally bad overacting. It's the same basic character he's done in all his movies, but now it's just under a different set of circumstances. Too bad a real comedic actor like Robin Williams didn't play the part. It might actually have been good."
3,"nice price, wish they were more durable","I keep buying puma since I like their design and laceless models. I only wish these shoes lasted longer. I have around 6 weeks with them and the cloth sewing that covers the plastic structure around the ankle has been disintegrating. I calculate a product life of 6 months.As always, delivery and purchase experience was excellent."
1,Too big,"You need to order 1-2 sizes smaller than your normal size, these things are massive boats. It doesn't matter if you have other Puma shoes in size X, go size X-1 here. Pretty mad that I wasted $40 on shoes I can't wear now, but that's what happens when you buy Amazon."
3,I DON'T read this for the articles,"I have several tattoos and am always looking for new ideas and inspirations. I know many people probably want the exposure that this magazine provides to their tattoo shops, but I would really appreciate more pics and less words. I am happy for anyone who can make a successful career performing body artwork, but show MORE and TALK less!!!!"
2,I didn't like this video,"I bought the whole set of the 17 dvd's and am working my way through them. This is the first one I didn't like. I thought Rob's message was kind of confusing and rambling and I thought the surprise ending was horrible. Everybody deserves a mulligan though (for you non golfers a mulligan is when you get to take a bad shot over) and as often happens the next dvd in the series, Dust, is one of the best.I don't have a lot of forgiveness issues (the topic of Luggage) so perhaps that's why it didn't resonate with me. You can see from the other reviews that it does resonate with some people."
2,Salt Collection,"This item was a nice selection, but the shipping and handling for such a small item, mad it not worth the purchase. Shipping and handling were $35.00 which I thought was ridiculous, I would not purchase from this store again."
1,Rusty Dinnerware,I wish I'd read these reviews BEFORE I bought my sister-in-law 12 sets of the Fiestaware Flatware for Christmas. She washes them in the dishwasher and in less than a month they have started rusting.Dishes are great but SKIP the flatware!!
5,WOW!!!!!,"All I have to say about this book is WOW!!! It is one Alan Dean Foster's best, second in my opinion to Midworld. Just get it read it, and enjoy."
4,"Great little player, good sound, long battery life","I got this as a spare and it works great, small, great sound, 40 hourson one AA battery and cheap, this was a great deal.Great for music but not so good for audiobooks, while has resume thefast forward/rewind is way to slow for large MP3 files, if you split thebooks into 2-3 minute tracks they don't always play in the correct order.Still a great deal though."
5,No Sophmore Jinx,"If you're looking for some bubblegum pop-punk, DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!!! If on the other hand you are looking for a no nonsense, straight to the point album, then ""Back to the World"" is for you. The Street Dogs stuck to the same formula that made their first album ""Savin Hill"" so brilliant. Their songs just get into your mind and make you think about yourself and the world around you. The first song, ""Strike a Blow"" defines who and what the Street Dogs are. ""You Alone"" focuses on taking the cards your dealt and making it work. The Street Dogs, in particular Mike McColgan, also pay homage to their hometown as evident by ""In Defense of Dorchester."" Throughout the album you will find songs of government misleadings (""Tale of Mass Deception""), the good and bad of alcohol (""Drink Tonight"" and ""Stagger""),the call to end violence against women (""Hands Down"") and of course the ever present pro-union anthem (""Unions and The Law""). This is an album I recomend."
5,"brilliant, insightful well written book","After reading this fascinating account -- I loved the interweaving of biography with general history -- I feel I now understand why the Holocaust happened in Germany. Germany looked like a modern country, but was not really part of Western European culture -- it was dominated by a militarized aristocracy, had never developed true representative democracy, and had achieved a very late unification by rallying its people around racism -- the idealization of the German race, and the denigration of the Jews in their midst. The biography of their monarchs shows a line of really sick, sadistic, militarily obsessed rulers, suitable progenitors for Hitler. A veneer of high culture and a strong econmy made them look like a modern country, but underneath was a much more backward country, morally and politcally."
2,Zipper broke off after only 2 weeks,"I was originally very happy the baby was nice and warm, but after only 2 weeks the zipper broke off and it was impossible to fix, they need to improve the quality. Also, it shrunk after the first wash and I did follow the directions."
2,Great until zipper broke,This is a great item until the zipper teeth came out of it. We live in NY and the winters get cold. I loved the bundle and would put my son in his winter outerwear and would use the bundle and it was great until it broke. My son is only 4 months old and we already have to get him another bundle.
2,"I love Irons and Cronenberg, but ooohhh...","Simply put, the overall execution was wanting.The individual elements were good: acting, production, sets, costuming, etc...but they didn't mesh well at all.This was highly disappointing to me, as I had read the play.And although I realize that it was part of the point, the actor in me really wished that a better casting choice could have been made in place of Lone. He's a superb actor but altogether too masculine to be convincing in any way to the audience. Again, I realize that it was necessary (i.e., only a person who thought of the East as ""effeminate"" could have fallen for that ""pretty face""), but perhaps a little help for the audience would have been nice. Of course, I don't know of any actors who would have fit the role better, but still...Anyway, the individual elements, plus the marvelous construction of the last scenes, save this film from falling completely flat on its face."
2,Colors Misrepresented,"While the rattle structure is as pictured, the one I received is only black and white and not full of different colors as pictured - a bit disappointing and not as fun for a baby."
4,Birds like it too,"This was tested by my pet parrots, which can dismember anything. It has survived 3 weeks and still going!! They love it. Interesting to the eye and ear, and keeps them busy! I suspect a toddler would love this (we raised 3)."
3,not what i had expected.,i thought this bucket of dominoes would be sturdy smooth and slightly weighted pieces such as real dominoes. they are actually smaller than average wooden pieces. very light in weight. it shipped from Giles Toys and they were very very helpful with their friendly customer service.
5,For the sophisticados of this photoshop world!,Exactly what the title of the book says!':every user needs to know.The charismatic S.Kelby strikes one more time.For the ones who are thirsty Kelby arrives with gallons of water.Classic Holy Water removes the pain from the traps and labyrinths of the photoshopper's chaotic mind.
3,Positives and Negatives,"My thoughts:Positive:* This went with my my theme of reading novels written in poetry.* It reminded me of how I was in high school. I was kinda lost and floating through friends. Although, I never ran away.* It's much like a movie.Negative:* It's extremely sad with no real ending.* I think that she doesn't ever realize how much she was taken advantage of and that would have been a strong lesson to learn.* It can be a little bit too like a movie and not completely believable."
2,"Amazing at first, but breaks","At first these headphones are great, but after a few weeks they stop working in 1 ear. Went through 4 pairs before switching to Koss KE29E headphones, which have not broken yet."
3,"fair sound, fair value","I have several sets of Koss earbuds. The best earbuds seem to be the ones with tips that fit in the ear. These have an O.K. fit and sound, and I suspect some users may find the fit better or worse than other earbuds. They seem to be at a lower volume than other earbuds I ownwhich leads me to believe that I'm either not getting the best fit, or they have a lower DB rating than others.,Koss KEB24 Portable Isolation Earbud (Black)"
5,Very good for the price.,"I bought these at Wal-Mart for 2 bucks less. I thought they might be cheap and not sound all that great considering my past Koss earbuds I bought, but that's totally inaccurate. These deliver very impressive bass for the size and are basically earplugs with speakers in them; they block out ambient noise very well. For 12-15 dollars, you really can't go wrong, replace almost any stock earbuds that come with an MP3 player with these, especially iPods. You for sure won't be dissatisfied.Edit:Also, watch out for some of these, as they tend to be very fragile. I replaced my first pair in a couple of days, but the others have been lasting for around a year now. If you want REALLY good bang for your buck, look up Sennheiser. You pay more... you get more. End of story."
1,great sound but.....,Everything was great until the right ear started shorting out after only a month of use at normal volume. That's all i have to tell you so you been warned!
4,A haunting story beautifully and simply told.,"This book snuck up on me. I liked the author's style and images right away -- I felt pulled into the world of Amelia Earhart. The story was so beautifully and simply written that I tumbled on page after page not wanting to stop. I continued to be haunted by the events that were happening -- were they real, is she dreaming, am I reading about an Amelia that exists on the spiritual plane now? I loved the quality of how much space Amelia needed to finally feel truly happy. I also loved that her solitude made her potential rescue seem like a capture -- how hard to return to the world of society and conventions. Very haunting read."
1,First person or third? Make up your mind.,"This book was awful. It goes back and forth between first and third person and each time it does so, the reader is disoriented. This book was also incredibly short. No offense to Amazon, but it was rather expensive considering I had in finished in 2 hours. I forced myself to read it because I paid for it."
5,THIS IS THE BEST CD IN THE WHOLE WORLD!,"I Still can't get over this CD! Every song is just great. The beats and lyrics are excellent. The BONUS DVD with the Prayer video (and behind the scenes) is excellent. I don't know why MTV rejected it. Anyway, this CD is Disturbed's finest hour yet, and David's voice keeps getting better and better!"
5,BELIEVE REVIEW,I love thi salbum! It's the best yet! Disturbed is great band and gives its fans one heck of a performance! I hope to hear more of them in the future!
2,Horrible voices,"Who told these people they could sing? Especially the male voice, he sounds a little bit like Weird Al but can't hold a note. It claims to be over an hour long and I believe it; however, I'm not sure that's a good thing. Listen to the previews, I shouldn't have wasted money on the CD."
5,Just what was needed,"Maintains the sewer hose at a proper slope; easy to use no matter the grade of the land; and, it makes my day when handling the job no one else wants to have or do. no hidden problems"
2,Sewer Hose,Just what we wanted for our travel trailer. Received promptly and was impressed with the quick delivery. Ordered from Amazon as it was much reasonable price than what we could purchase at a camping store.
5,Great little gadget,"Very easy to use, very easy to fold up and handle makes it super easy to carry and store. Works great! Beats leaving your black water hose on the ground or rot and helps the flow into the septic."
3,~Thumbs Down~,"This fiction book is about a boy named Andy,15, who tries to juggle school and chores around the house. Since his mom got a job, he and his two older sisters, Dennie and Molly, all have to take and pick up their younger, six year old twin sisters from school. When his grandmother's house catches on fire, she moves in with them, and his life gets a little more complicated. After that, she accidentally runs over a man and they fall in love! Their dating gets serious and they want to get married. However, Andy's dad doesn't like Grams's new guy. Will they ignore him, or elope to Reno?What I thought about the book:It's a good book because it hows how anyone's life can get complicated and shows that you have to be understanding of your family. Personally, I had mixed feelings about the book beacause I didn't really see anything ""sparkely"" in it. Also, the main character was a boy so it was a little hard to get into the story."
4,transparent color,"Very helpful tool for organizing. I did not want a tab to be sticking out of the binder and beeing caught on to things. These are just like regular sheet protectors but in a variety of color. The darker colors are a tinny bit too dark and may be kind of hard to read through them, the green and especially the blue one, but I still love them anyway."
3,A child's necklace,"I didn't realize at the time of purchase that the size of this necklace is so small. I ended up saving it for a present to a small child. It is pretty, just not what I had wanted.Ordering and shipping was fine."
3,The Rover,"Virginia Woolf said that all women together should let flowers fall upon the tomb of Aphra Behn - for it was she who earned them the right to speak their minds - well, within the Rover, her sexual politics are personified through the character of Angelica Bianca : and it makes for an intriguing read! Brandishing swords, embracing rape and finding their own individual identities in a society that veiwed women as second class subject, this remained the most frequently performed play right up until 1800!"
5,Everything's coming up flowers ...,"How wonderful to see this book at this phenomenally reduced price! That should open up the opportunity for many garden enthusiasts to purchase it and make it part of their (uh hum) perennial collection! It's a must-have, must-read, must-sow for every gardener or ""wannaweed"" gardener!"
4,The Devil's Door,"As a student of Medieval History and an avid reader of bothmystery novels and historical novels this book was right up my alley. Newman's characters are lively and the plot moves quickly and logically, though not necessarily predictably. I have read two books in this series and am eager to read the rest of them. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a light mystery read with an historical setting. I have read this book twice myself. END"
4,Its about the compartment !,"The Book in front is just a few (64) pages to amuse the reader, and actually quialify this item as a book. The content of the book does not matter. It's all about the secret stash place inside the book. After the brief 64 pages of entertainment, there is a 3/4 inch deep by 7 inch by 5 inch compartment to hide things. So,, the fake book is actually all about being a ""fake"" book to hide money, documents, whatever,, in. I would have given this book another star if the compartment was not cheap plastic, but it serves the purpose. Put between real books in your dorm room, study,or bedroom, and keep whatever you want private."
4,So handy!,I used this study to teach a high school and junior high Bible study. A lot of good material to pull from. the only down side is that they printed it to look hip so some of the pages are hard to read. I would continue this series.
2,Only really useful to high school student,"I wash very disappointed with the style of writing in the book - more like a text book - and the information seemed trival.If you've never been to Brasil, you ""might"" read this book; but only if you want a very superfical understanding of the people."
3,my girlfriend call that a pamphlet...,"Only one page very interesting, the rest of the book it's about exercise for the pose method, if it's that you want get it. But you will not learn pose method only with that booklet."
5,"Filled with useful, practical ideas","If you want to make your marketing efforts take off, read this book. If you want to jump start sales, read this book. If you want to increase new business opportunities, read this book.Each page contains a fresh idea, written in a way that you will enjoy, understand and remember.It's like a marketing toolbox."
2,Ugly shirt,I only buy Ekco shirts & they are high quality. This shirt is plain butt ugly. Pink & blue stripes in different directions & the size is a xxl not a large. Ekco shirts are larger than normal due to rap style size but this is crazy. No wonder on sale.
5,Learn Design Through Comics,"If you would like to learn more about conceptual, interaction, and interface design of comic books, consider spending some time with Scott McCloud's ""Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art."" It will be time well spent and you might even want to read some of his other wonderful books.For more book reviews, please visit: [...]"
5,Quite an eye-opener.,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this book, but I took a chance and bought it. This book goes beyond the average reader's understanding of comics, but presents as both clear and interesting.Frankly, ""Understanding Comics"" doesn't read like a textbook, but more like a graphic novel. By the end of the 2nd chapter, you'll be oblivious to the fact that you're actually learning something."
5,Sublime!,"I hear for first time of this book in a great art workshop with Barron Storey in my country. Ecuador. Barron recomended this book to us. He was right,it is a fabolous book.For me is the real introduction for the lovely art of making comings, I will recomend this book always!Escuché de este libro por primera vez en un gran taller de arte que hice con el ilustrador Barron Storey en mi país,Ecuador.Barron fue profesor de Scott macloud y recomendó enfáticamente este libro a todos los que que queríamos aprender un poco más del arte de hacer comics y tenía razón para mi es un libro fabuloso,es la verdadera introducción para conocer más de este arte.recomiendo mucho este libro a los hispanohablantes: A pesar de que el libro está en Inglés es en realidad muy fácil de entender y además es muy entretenido."
1,DEAD SOLID PERFECT,"WHY WAS THE KINDLE VERSION OF THIS BOOK DIFFERENT THAN THE HARD COVER? I READ THE HARD COPY SEVERAL YEARS AGO, AND THE KINDLE VERSION LEFT OUT HALF THE BOOK"
2,Not as good as it could be,"As an avid golf fan I was looking forward to reading it, but.........rambling story, I read it all, but I could hardy wait for the end of the book."
5,For a Great Trip,"If you are planning a trip to Walt Disney World this is a must have book. It tells you all about the rides, shops, and dining. Everything is broken down by park and tells you hints or helpful tips and how to spend your time wisely. I've been to Disney many times and this book, a new one every year, helps in informing me on what is new and what has changed. If you are big on food Disney has some of the best and the dining section is great. The best of is a good way to see what others have liked. Over all this is a great book with a lot of information on when to go, temp, rain, special events, everything you can think of. This book is like the Bible of Walt Disney World. Get it and enjoy a great trip!"
4,Exciting mystery with romantic hero,"Although there were a few historical inaccuracies, as well as some mistakes in French, the author brings us a dashing, somehwat mysterious hero with a romantic side. If you want to read a solidly written historical mystery for its escapist story, the adventures, and the characters, this is a fun read."
5,gods of guster,"Guster- Keep It TogetherAnother one bites the dust. the Gods of Guster complete yet another drop down and out album. there quirky upbeat yet painstaking sound drowns out any other, up against rhythmic b0ngo drums with a sent of killer texting that sits on the tip of your tongue till itll spill over into ever-loving extasy*."
2,Lost and gone emo,"Musically speaking, ""Keep it together"" could be mistaken for a different band. Guster's had an evolving sound throughout all their records, but this is less evolution and more mutation.This album would fit in well on any contemporary radio station, amidst emo, ""punk,"" and other pop-friendly genres. While Guster have always been catchy and never been too ""experimental,"" This jumps into the pool with the other sickeningly sweet pop music.Perhaps it's what they wanted, but I'm vastly disappointed in this record, longtime fan or not."
4,Wonderful Fix,"I have recently purchased ""Keep it Together""... and have found it to be great. I have been a guster fan for a couple of years and it only seems to grow as I continue to hear more of their music and attend more concerts. I am drawn to the energy they emit... lead by the marvelous percussion... but also the amazing vocal harmonies...they make me melt. ""Keep it Together"" is definitely unique in its style... they continue to show growth... I am immediately drawn into the first four songs on the disc... fabulous... a definite keeper ... that just makes me happy. I have even gotten a non-guster fan to admit that he likes Amsterdam... big steps.... buy any and all Guster discs and you will not be disappointed!!"
1,Ugly Grapics!,The book is probably quite useful. But I didn't like the graphics at all. So I couldn't get myself to start working with it. hm.
2,Less is More,"I realize that Hogarth is up there with the greats of figure drawing royalty however this book regarding the clothed figure is over exaggerated. One doesn't need that many folds, winkles, pulls, etc to say the same thing. It not only looks painful and unnatural but also often looks like the figure just came out of the rinse cycle of their washing machine. Having said that, if this is the style you are deliberately going for in your art, then this is the book for you but if not, I'd skip this one."
3,"Nice, basic case with a touch of class. Way too expensive.","It holds the Nano kind of like a wallet holds a dollar bill - snug and secure. Also, it's a very thin case. It's actually almost the exact same thickness as the Nano. But you have to take the Nano out in order to do anything with it. There's no mini-window to access the Nano's controls, and no way to sync or charge the unit unless it's completely removed. Plus, you have to insert the Nano upside down in order to access the headphone jack.On the plus side, it's built very well with a nice, soft felt interior. Obviously the Chinese took great care in putting this thing together. Probably to help with Apple's $99 price tag. Amazon's got it for $59. Best Buy has it for $39. For that, it's probably worth it."
3,Not HP,"Since my purchase order said HP 92298A toner cartridge, that is what I expected. It was a remanufactured toner cartridge. It works fine but it is not what was advertised. I knew it was a very good price for HP but I still believe it should have been advertised as a ""Premium compatible toner cartridge"" not HP."
1,"Complete FAIL - terrible item, worse customer service","IF I could give this seller ZERO stars, I would. This print cartridge made a horrible screeching noise when it was first installed, then proceeded to paper-jam every page. When I finally got it to print without jamming, it only printed about 200 pages, making a ""rubbing on paper"" sound every page and then jammed again. After I removed the paper jam this last time and resumed printing, it only printed BLANK PAGES!!! I contacted Eric Strong with Supply Link, LLC and he pushed me off onto HP for a replacement of this clearly defective print cartridge. WOW, what a disappointment."
5,new old stock HP laserjet toner,"Over the years, I have purchased dozens of second market HP Laserjet toners. This vendor promtly shipped the product which arrived in the original but resealed HP carton. The box was date stamped May,2003. The toner appeared to be brand new. The first several copies were perfect. However, after that, each copy became unusable, arriving with a grey overlay, I contacted the vendor by telephone to report the problem. At no additional cost, the vendor promptly send a replacement toner that arrived two days after the phone call. The replacement, also still in its orginal factory box was installed and has worked perfectly. So,this vendor proved to be better than the product but if you can count on quick and free replacement of a failed toner, why should that be a problem?"
5,Great reading: Great gift for that thoughtful someone,"Möller's collection of poems consists of different ""chapters"" that investigate various themes such as love, women, language, nature etc. Not a native speaker of English, she provides us with a different perspective on these topics that are presented within their socio-historical context. Literary references add to the connections she is weaving between each poem and its reader. Bold imagery, rhythmic variations, and unadulterated diction make for a moving lyrical experience in both, form and content. This collection culminates with the poem ""A Drop in the Channel,"" a conceptual tour de force during which the writer literally builds a relationship with her reader. For a mixture of humorous as well as tragic insight, I recommend the poems in the section ""Once Upon Our Time,"" reminiscent of folk songs and lore."
1,Book of Escher art,Could not understand the head or tail of the book. if only he could get rid of the gnomes. My initial impression was that the gnomes must there only in the beginning of the chapters to start out the explaination of COM and DCOM...but unfortunately it dragged on and with it my attention..Highly not recommended..
3,To many needless examples!,"This is my very first exposure to COM and DCOM. Reading this book did give me the basic knowledge of what COM and DCOM are and what are microsofts plans for the future. BUT to tell everyone the truth, why have so many examples and drag the subject to nearly 45 - 60 pages per chapter?? To make one point, one has to read a whole page!! Go on the the next point please!!! We can all read opinions about Java and Microsoft and the rest in a magazine. Dont put it in a book for goodnesssake!If I even knew a little about COM and DCOM, this book would definately not be for me! I give it 3 stars because I actually learnt something."
1,Examples use source files that are not readily available.,"Gave up on the book when I found that an include file needed for one of the early examples is not readily available. It seems like there are enough other Com books out there, I would rather spend my time with a book that has examples that can be implemented as I read the book."
3,Ups and Downs,"This DVD has its ups and downs. I really like the idea of how they incorporated footage to go along with the names and meanings of the Belle and Sebastian songs. But in a sense this looks like it was thrown together over a course of a day. It should have been much better organized... put better in sync with the music, and thought out clearly. There are points in the DVD where I found myself completely amused but points that I found myself completely oblivious to whats going on. So if you are considering buying this... sure go for it, I'm not going to bash the DVD by any means, But I warn you."
1,SIMPLY HORRID DURGE,"One star too many. I cannot believe that anyone with even moderate hearing would give this more than 1 star. KELLY's vocals are nothing short of unlistenable. Her lyrics are on par with her vocals and her guitar playing ( totaly mindless and unrelated notes ) is not even that good. If this was played by a 12 year old with 6 month tuition, one might suspect that there is some talent lurking somewhere. From a seasoned player this is unforgivable. Amongst the many many notes, there is not one interesting one. How anyone can mangle HEY JOE and CROSSROADS into the horrid tunes they become in KELLY's hands is beyond me. Not one redeeming feature. There are 1000's of better ( can't think of a lesser one as a matter of fact ) players out there. Even the fact that she is one of only a handfull of female players can't save this dreadfull effort."
4,Another Great addition to the series.,"I enjoyed this Sackett adventure almost as much as ""Sackett's Land. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to read the Sackett series."
5,louis lamour,"As expected ""To The Far Blue Mountains"" is classic Lamour storytelling.Barnabus Sackett goes where no europeans have gone before and makes the far blue mountains his home.There are no cowboys yet just explorers and Indians.Start with ""Sacketts Land"" and then move to ""The Far Blue Mountains"" and then ""The Warriors Path"" finishing up with ""Jubal"".These are the stories that come during the earliest days of what we call America.These stories will take you from old England to Carolina and the Tennessee hills.Once you are hooked you will just keep on going down the line and the next story is ""Ride The River"" which takes place just prior to the Civil war."
4,This book gives a unbiased view of the beatles history.,It presents the full Beatle history with out empasizing any one member too much. And gives a critical look into how they were a product of the time that they came to be in.
1,Deserves a 0,"Why can't we give a bad novel a 0? I never look at the reviews until I have read the book as I don't want to risk someone throwing me a spoiler but I wish I had with this one...It took me 4 full weeks to read this one, along with some which were better, and I read 6-7 hours a day in my lovely retirement. the small town cop should, I think, have interviewed all the peers of the two victims in an effort to pin down the murderer. Alec Davenport would have. I thought NRK18 hit the nail on the head when she said there were really 2 books here. I admit I enjoyed the information (if true) on the Bronte family. I doubt I will ever read BTB again. Woman of Substance was wonderful."
4,"Great Tool for Biblical, Exegetical Study",Great tool for everyday usage. Although I personally wish I'd bought the leather one only because of its flexibility. Other than that purchase this bible.
4,"Sober Reading, But Shows How To Live Out God's Sovereignty","My wife and I had the honor of hearing Gary Witherall speak at the Voice Of The Martyrs national conference in June, 2006.This easy to read book tells the story of Gary and Bonnie Witherall. I don't think I'm spoiling anything to mention that Bonnie was murdered by a terrorist in Lebanon in 2002.This book is well written, and easy to follow. It contains excerpts of Gary's and Bonnie's journals, and gives more of an insight.This book is appropriate for pre-teens to read; the violence that takes place is not graphic.For me, I didn't love this book. It is an important story, and it is insightful. On the positive side, it shows how God is active in people's lives. It does have some facts that are not positive, though, and left me a little discouraged over all. This is my personal perspective.Please don't let my review hinder you from reading this biography of a surrendered life. After all, this is what all Christians are called to."
5,Laurie Notaro ROCKS! What a GREAT book!,"I love this woman. I read the first story in this new collection, and by the end I was in danger of requiring a box of the Extra Absorbent Depends! I was laughing so hard my husband asked me if I was going to pass out. I have loved every book since her first, Idiot Girls Adventure Club. Then Autobiography of a Fat Bride came out, and I rejoiced! Now this one...it's even better than the last! Her writing is wonderful, warm and funny and monumentally truthful. I can hardly wait for the next book! Meanwhile, I will read this one till the spine cracks (like I did her others) and enjoy every word! Thanks Laurie! You Rock!"
2,Very forced.,"I purchased this book on a whim and was thoroughly disappointed (there goes my future spontaneous purchases!). Couldn't even get through it because it's attempts at humor were so flat, they were almost insulting. Thank God for target's return policy; I exchanged the book for Susan Gilman's 'Hypocrite...', which I thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend."
5,HAHAHAHAHA AND MORE...........,"I haven't laugh this hard in a long time.... I was having so much fun that I gave one to my daughter and she would called me late at night, just laughing and telling me which page to go to and it was a great bonding experience........It is awesome! thank you Laurie!"
5,Love you Laurie!!!,"Laurie is a pleasure to read time and time again. In her latest, she does once again had me laughin out loud. Her humourous recording of real life, and the fact that she talks about what no one else does, makes her a favorite! Can't wait for the next book~"
5,I like it.,"I've only had this CD player for a month, but as I hear things, it delivers an unbias sound reproduction that is crisp and clean. Haven't had the chance to explore the various settings yet. But so far, I'm pleased."
2,Nothing Special,This pack is over-priced. The design is nothing special and materials quality is poor. The zippers are particularly low grade and will be short lived. Not a good value.
5,Great Film,Brought back memories of the early sixties when I saw this movie at a reserved seating theater in Cinerama in Toronto. Still impressive.
4,Saw it in Cinemiracle years ago. Great to see it again.,Travelog a bit dated but still fun if you saw the original. Newbies might not appreciate it fully. Recommended for experience.
4,A Name is Sometimes More than a Name,"I have to admit that it was random chance that led me to this book. I have a company called Arius3D which was named after a concept. I knew that Arius was one of the first heretics rebuked by ""The Church"" and at Arius3D we seemed to be viewed as heretics in the world of 3D graphics so the name was born.It was with great delight that I cam across a book about the original heretic. From cover to cover, the book provides a fascinatring look at the early Chirch and it's gravitation towards dogma and away from the pure Christian message. I was enthralled by the telling of the tale of Arius, the man who stood against the rising tide of the newly founded 'corporate church'. Pre-dating the Cathars, Arius takes us down the road of understanding how the Church began to formulate its approach to creating and maintaining control over the 'Christian message'.Excellent work."
2,DId you ever learn how to program?,This book was a waste of time and money. The author does not know how to explain the concept well enough to use the knowledge for the web. I would rather through my money in the wather than buying this book
5,"Excellent details, a lot of fun to read, lots of pictures.","This book not only provides the nitty gritty of keeping the porch on an old house from falling apart, it gives the history of porches, details about the lifestyles lived on porches in the 19th and 20th centuries, and lots of photos of porches. Look here for the historically appropriate railings for an early Victorian porch, or the furniture to put on your turn-of the century porch. Amusing stories of the famous, views of hotels noted for their porches; serving tea on the porch - this book isn't just a how-to, it's a why-was-it and why-keep-it that will add to your knowlege of the history of houses."
2,Disappointing,"This book shows you how to add zip to someone else's work. It does not show you how to create your own from scratch. If you are a purist and wish to label your item ""handmade by ----"", this is not the book for you. Mostly cigar box purses and cheap, boring pre-purchased canvas bags are used. No creative shapes. If you sew, don't bother."
3,Not as expected,"This is a nice watch, but does not look like a two tone watch in person. The gold color is quite muted, so it is basically a stainless steel watch."
2,Hypothyroidism,This book is outdated and has no depth for todays lifestyle issues of which hypothyroidism is an underlying cause of many of our health problems.Not enough emphasis on iodine and its role in supporting thyroid and emphasises too much on the medical answer with thyroxine. I was disappointed and would not have purchased the book had I saw the date of it. Anything written before 1998 and by a doctor is limited and narrow.
2,Nothing more than a Gigolo,"What a lame excuse for a man Massimo Gargia is. He's nothing more than a male prostitute, having never had any sort of a meaningful relationship with a woman his age. He loves to sleep in, have elderly women buy him apartments in exchange for sleeping with them, never held down a real job, loves to brag about how good looking he is and how good he is in bed.The book is a revealing inside look into how superficial and pathetic the Jet Set really are. The only person that comes across as somewhat respectable is Francoise Sagan. An interesting read if for no other reason than to find out how privileged you really are by not being a part of this group that calls themselevs 'The Jet Set'"
2,Almost But Not Quite ...,"Just received mine after long backorder. One major item prevents it being really useful - with no builtin browser there is no way to authenticate and use free or fee-based public WiFi networks except in limited ways - e.g. my home.No metro based WiFi networks, no coffee shops .. few hotels. So near yet so far.Sound quality is actually superior to my PC for Skype. Size is good. Recharges off USB cable to my laptop so extra power brick not needed. Power management needs work."
3,GREAT IDEA BUT STILL WITH TOO MANY BUGS,"I bought four of these Netgear wi-fi skype phones for our office since we speak everyday with our engineers on site in Africa.The idea of having a phone always on without having to be connected with your PC is certainly great and particularly time-saving.However, even if the phone works quite well, it is full of small bugs.I had to re-enter the details of my connection 8 times until it memorized them, it lost the phonebook twice, it is not very easy to install, etc. etc.Therefore if you really need now a wi-fi skyoe phone please buy it. Otherwise wait for a more tested model to appear."
2,Great form factor. Extremely poor performance...,"I completely agree with W. Yeh's assessment of this unit but would like to add a few ""nits"" to the mix.Voice Quality: Call clarity on the SPH101 couldn't approach that of Skype on my laptop. Lots of dropouts and static occurred that would typically be associated with network problems. After doing some isolation tests, I concluded that the units CPU was likely underpowered and was the cause of many and various audio artifacts.Battery Life: Twenty (20) minutes talk time killed more than half of the available battery life. Six hours of standby completely drained the unit.I am returning the unit tomorrow."
1,bad phone,i wasted my money on this phone. paid $120.00 including shipping. it takes forever to connect with my wirless lan. then i have to charge this every 6 hrs. otherwise you don't even know that it died while waitinf for a phone call. bad phone
1,Does not work well,I had to return it just because everytime I talked it got disconnected and I had to turn it off and then on again to be able to call again.
2,Battery Life Sucks big time,The phone and the Skype application in itself is fantastic. It is what I have been waiting for a long time now.But the battery life is pathetic. The phone goes flat after having a half hour phone call. Even standby time is quite bad. The most I've seen it last on standby without making call is just under 24 hrs.Another problem which I noticed was a case of excess heat being dissipated during a call. Heat comes over from the phone around the ear piece area. It can get quite hot sometimes that it makes it difficult keep the phone against your ear.I'm quite disappointed with the product after shelling out nearly US$250 for it.
3,I need reliability and this is not it,"I thought the phone would be really cool, so I ordered it. When I received it, it did not work. Netgear let me ship it back and another arrived in the mail. It worked, but not very well. I was so disappointed. I figured that maybe my network was not very good at home, but no; it did not work consistently at Starbucks, the office (T1 lines get to the office, so wireless is pretty good), etc.Bummer. I am searching for a reasonably priced, consistent Skype phone that does not keep me tethered to a computer. I did not find it with this phone."
3,netgear skype wifi phone,"not too impressed; the battery seems to get hot and does not last for as long as they say !also you need VERY GOOS WIFI SIGNALS to make these calls; also no SMS abilities on the phone, and no silicone cover available; otherwise it is alright"
2,Cool idea but doesn't work very well,"The idea is cool to make Skype calls without being connected to a computer. When it works, it's great...getting it to work properly/dependably is the trouble. Before buying, check out the Netgear forum to see all the problems owners of this phone are having. Hopefully a new firmware will be offered to fix the issues."
4,A Solid Album from an Underrated Band,"For those of you out there excepting ""Pull II"" -- it ain't happening. That was close to 15 years ago and people and times change. LET IT GO. If you are able to put the ""old"" Winger behind you and simply expect great song-writing, vocals, and musicianship, this is a pearl of an album that's worth buying. I have listed to Winger IV probably around 35 times or so. It grows on you and doesn't get old. IMO, ""Blue Suede Shoes"" far and away is Kip Winger's best song ever; it's an anthem to our GIs written from their point of view that, had Winger had the popularity it had in the late 80s/early 90s, would have been on heavy MTV rotation and a top 20 hit. ""Four Leaf Clover"" features a great rythm guitar riff. And ""M-16"" is another cool song."
1,Weak,"Bought this hoping it would be a continuation of the ""Pull"" era. Wrong. Wasted my money on this. Don't waste yours."
4,"Decent, but don't expect any ""over the top tunes""","I own all Winger releases, and they all contain great musicianship and songwriting. This album has more of a darker feel like his solo albums, so don't expect any bombastic pop hits like ""Madelaine"" or awesomely produced ballads like ""Miles Away"". Just expect solid mid-tempo, introspective well-written tunes, and you'll enjoy this album. Hopefully they'll tour and we'll get to hear the ""classics"" again."
4,great return.,this is a great cd. the band is older and so with that you get a band that doesnt really care about the music popular today. it has a prog rock blend but it is still clearly winger. gotta say im a little displeased with the way people were bashing pull. i thought this cd picked up were pull left off. pull wasnt a grunge cd it was simply not another heart of the young cd. thanks for taking the time to read this and if you buy this cd i hope you enjoy it.
3,More theory than practice!,"As a commercial GPS user, I was looking for a book that would offer a fairly basic overview of GPS, but that would still go into significant detail. This book does exactly that, but it also covers a lot of the mathematical theory behind GPS. This book certainly isn't introductory and I think would be more suited to a surveyor with a good knowledge of surveying techniques who was interested in GPS. The mathematics gets a bit heavy for a non-mathematician but Chapter 7 (Surveying with GPS) is an excellent introduction/review of the practical uses of GPS in the field. A good intermediate-advanced level book, probably very suited to students."
1,HEAVY METAL light... Best to leave this for Jr. High boys.,"First, 'Heavy Metal' is a light weight compared to other rock films (i.e. ""PINK FLOYD - THE WALL"", ""Who's Tommy"") . But more importantly, 'Heavy Metal' is more a visual piece than anything else.I wasn't very impressed with this film. It seems to be more geared to sexually curious 13 year old boys swimming in sweaty jock straps and wet dreams than any real audience. More like an animated issue of Playboy. (Which isn't all that bad) ;-) Let's not forget to mention the varied background tracks from 80's artists like Stevie Nicks or Black Sabbath. The tracks were inserted at appropriate times of action during the film, creating no big perks. Too obvious... The aimless plot can be easily summerized, a glowing green ball. wow... Naked men and women reminescent of He-Man action figures... super..."
3,"Great film, but dated","When you watch this film, you have to place yourself in the mindset of when it came out. Its early 1980's. Disney isn't doing animation like it used to. Japanamation isn't well known outside its own world, and audiences aren't used to R rated cartoons. When we look at it now the animation seems primitive in some scenes, but in other scenes its quite beautiful. Despite its title, don't expect your eardrums to be blown out. What was heavy metal back then seems more like bluesy hard rock to our modern ears.Despite its age and minor flaws, I've chosen to add it to my movie collection. Whenever I watch it I will be reminded of a point in time of my life."
1,"Rating is for picture quality, not the movie itself.","I bought this the minute I could when it was first released and I'm sorry I did. I love everything about this movie itself, the music, the art, but the picture quality of this blu ray is hideous. Someone needs to get serious about restoring this film and stop pedaling trash. People go to blu ray to get the most out their TV's and to get the best possible quality of the film they can get. This release is a total rip off."
5,HEAVY METAL RULES!,Love this movie. Loved it when it was released at the movie theaters years ago. Great quality video and sound. Love how they really boosted the sound so it cranks up good on the surround sound system. Highly recommend getting this if anyone is into metal music and great animation.
5,Heavy Metal (Collector's Edition),"I had only seen this film on tv, but the only way to view this film is without censorship. I wanted to see the film unedited and this collector's edition DVD doesn't disappoint. I loved the extras and the documentary, which explains why this film was so groundbreaking in 1981. The film also has a great soundtrack, which I plan to purchase. If you enjoy adult animation and fantasy, then this filmHeavy Metal (Collector's Edition)is for you!"
4,Better than expected.,"Many are siting or slighting this movie for being a bit on the adolescent side. Having studied what goes into films and stories in general for many years, I can only guess that those persons either haven't really seen the film, haven't studied film, storytelling, and the like, or simply can not grasp the overall theme of this piece.The story essentially deals with a being claiming to be the personification of ""evil"" that explains it's history, and actions to a young girl through a variety of tales, emphasizing morality, tenacity, and the darker facts of life. Through this education, it strengthens equips and encourages her to take up the fight against evil, leading one to wonder if the Lok-Nar really IS evil, is deeply fighting against it, or just playing it's role in the cosmos.HEAVY METAL contains a series of stories that run the gamut from comedy to pure horror, and often a healthy mixture of the two. There are a variety of animation styles from many artists."
5,Nice Blender with a great price !,I bought this Hamilton Beach Blender 2 months aso and it works perfectly for me.The glass jar is good quality so I stopped to worry about blending hot soups that can broke the plastic jar.I'm so happy with my purchase.
2,"Leaked a lot, didn't last!","This blender worked ok. After awhile, it leaked a small amount through the seal. I tried some tricks, like putting butter, or olive oil on the seal, would work for a bit, then would start leaking again.It never made real smooth smoothies, left the ice a bit chunky. Some of the buttons stopped working, so not all speeds were available.It was very sensitive to the liquid to ice proportions or it would just spin and not blend.Recently the motor started to burn out, we ordered one that had mostly good reviews, we'll see."
5,A well-sculpted novel.,"This sculpted story positively radiates through its simple but shapely prose. A village of stoneworkers labors smugly as their way of life begins to crumble from the intrusion of the Bronze Age. One among them sees and tells the truth, a man who lacks one lower arm. Unable to work stone, he takes on the craft of storytelling and feeds it with wanderlust. His tales create laughter but also foreboding in the villagers, who, like us, are made to confront love and work and ""the slavery of skill""."
1,Just Awful!,"These folks seem to have cobbled together some VERY basic small business articles and filled in the blanks with the words ""in Hawaii"". It is telling that no one would take credit for actually authoring this poor excuse for an entrepreneurial blueprint. All of this information, especially regarding Hawaii-specific laws, organizations and local conditions can readily be found on the Net - much more current and certainly more interestingly presented. Nothing Smart about this boring brick; save your money."
1,Not a great disc,"If you want to hear George Lopez at his best, just buy America's Mexican. This disc has the same material as that one, but America's Mexican is funnier because it is in front of a bigger audience."
1,Not for Magellan GPS Companion for Palm,Be carefull not to by this as an accessory for the Magellan GPS Companion for Palm. It is not the correct part!
3,Investing Approach to Conservative,"This book should have been called ""Investing for those Afraid to take Risks"". Throughout the book Tyson pushes prospective investors to not play the stock market and only invest in mutual funds. This may be good advice for somebody who is turning 55 and is risk averse, but if you want your money to grow more aggressively than you may be more interested in ""Stock Investing for Dummies"" by the same publisher."
5,Scott Baio teenage Sith?,"I almost, almost forgot about this movie and found out by accident a month ago or so it was coming out on DVD. What a cult classic!!! We all know Scott Baio to be the nice guy. Well in ""Zapped"" he is a nice guy, but with a twist, he has telekinetic powers via an experiment done in a high school laboratory. Then he sort of takes out his frustrations out on people who annoy him or have made his life miserable. Plenty of nudity, adult language and 1980s style/fashion.Scott Baio has that semi-Sith quality about him, just watch ""Zapped"" and you will know what I mean. In conclusion, I can't wait to buy this movie, if you didn't already figure that part out. My only regret is I wish I had done cool experiments when I was in high school to give me powers. No we were too busy participating in norm reference testing.I'm just saying......"
3,"Not Oscar material, but okay.","I'm a long time fan of ""Happy Days"" and ""Charles in Charge"", and was glad to finally find a copy of this flick. I had heard many negative reviews about it, but after viewing it, didn't think it was so bad. Scott Baio stars as Barney Springboro, a shy, introverted high school chemist who develops telekenesis (ability to move things with one's mind) after an accident in his lab. There are a couple of nude scenes, but nothing to get riled about. I thought it was great to see a shy guy like Springboro make a fool out of his enemies with his new powers. Purchase it!"
3,80s Overload,"During the eventual Prom scene in nearly all high school movies, there is a song that lyrically defines the film's thrust. It's fitting that the song for this film contains the words golden memories, because that is essentially what caused me to rewatch Zapped after nearly three decades.Scott Baio and Willy Aames star in this theatrical - if it actually was shown in theaters - version of Charles in Charge. Expect tight shorts, mediocre acting, a few great boob shots (gorgeous Heather Thomas), forty-somethings playing teenagers, and completely implausible screenwriting unchallenged explicitly because it was the 80s.Watch it to reminisce, but don't expect too much."
3,Too puerile & mediocre to be truly good camp,"There is no way anyone could call this a good movie, but it is so mediocre to be more forgettable than anything else. I would imagine that most horny teens who might actually watch this movie these days (for whatever reason) will simply fast-forward through most of the boring dialogue and wooden acting to get to the more satisfying scenes featuring an assortment of low-budget models having their clothes ripped off. More puerile than amusing, these scenes amount to maybe 10-15 minutes of the entire movie and really aren't all that remarkable in and of themselves. This movie is an artifact more than anything else, showing just how pathetically desperate young males (the same demographic that made ""Porky's"" the runaway hit that it became) were in the early 1980's. It is such a hopelessly pathetic, forgettable movie that I don't have the heart to give it the one star that it probably deserves. It cannot even get its badness right."
4,biggest regret of my life,One of the biggest regrets of my life was being in a video store about 10 years ago and seeing a new copy of Zapped for 12 bucks. I had the money but decided to buy beer with it. It still stings (but not as bad since you can get anything on Amazon now) The hunter doesn't hunt for the kill he hunts for the hunt. The Baio/Ames comedy tandem rivals Akroyd/Belushi in terms of comic timing and hilarity. One of my all-time favorite scenes is in this moving with an under the influence Scattman Crothers and some sort of gun that fires hot dogs or baloney (can't remember)
4,DVD?,I know this isn't the greatest movie of all time but I would like to add it to my DVD collection.
3,FUTURE WEATHER DISASTER POSSIBILITIES,"'Terror from the Skies' is a small book, probably published by Chaston himself, and not one likely to be found in any bookstore. I got my copy through an add in a science magazine. The book's first half describes strange weather happenings such as post-thunderstorm heat blasts as high as 130 F, and instances of the jet stream hitting the earth with its destructive winds. Mixed in with such descriptions of mayhem are meteorological explanations of such phenomenah. The book's second half looks at global warming and how much worse everything would be if the ozone layer dissapeared. It is possible, he says, that in such a world hail could be truck sized and tornadoes could be ten miles wide!This is a great book for the weather freak, but is a bit too technical for some of us. Chaston was clearly unsure just how scientific his book should be."
5,Invaluable,"The best resource book I've found. Concise, excellent pictures, easy to use. Many of my fellow house plant owners wish they had this book on their shelves. Hope a reprint is coming soon."
2,Hard to find the Nuggets,I was trying to use this book to discover nuggets concerning school reform. Book was a little to specific and not helpful to me.
1,Not what Amazon advertised!,"This cable and Cig adapter was advertised as an accessory for the Magellan Explorist 210, so I bought it. It does not fit the 210! No how, no way. DO NOT BUY IT FOR ANYTHING BUT WHAT IT SAYS, NO MATTER WHERE AMAZON SAYS IT FITS!!!"
3,Review on Vocabulary Control for Information Retrieval,This book helps the computer scientists who are willing to find the way of developping Search Engines in the Web.
1,Disappointed,"This sounded like a good option for me because I travel to countries where I cannot replace a watch battery. But it is very, very hard to read the hands of the watch because of the glare from the glass and it gains about 10 minutes a week! Does NOT keep good accurate time."
5,Technical but VERY Interesting,"Though this book goes deeper into the technical aspects of the eruption, it is a fascinating read composed of many witness accounts. All areas of the event are covered in great detail, yet it is thoroughly explained so the average reader will understand. Lots of reading here, but I highly recommend it for anyone with a fascination for one of history's most notable natural disasters."
3,"Chewbacca and broken C-3PO, how does he carry 3PO?","This set was exciting to visualize in concept, but when it arrived, my 6 year old was stumped by how the carrying bag with C-3PO in pieces worked. Being a life long toy lover, and handy at figuring out puzzles and what not, I figured I would have it conquered quickly. After trying many different things, it just doesn't seem possible! Hasbro does not include any instructions on how to attach the carrying bag to Chewy, and the picture doesn't really show how it did it either.So next was enlisting the jigsaw puzzle pro, but my wife was dumbfounded as well.So if you are looking to buy this toy for its unique quality and fun of recreating the scene from the movie, good luck figuring it out. And if you do succeed in this task, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!!"
2,Poor customer service,"My dog absolutely loves this bed. Unfortunately, after about a month, the foam sides became unglued from the bottom of the bed. I have contacted the company several times to find out what I could use to glue it all back together again, but they do not respond. I'm very disappointed in this product, and even more disappointed in dogbed king's customer service practices."
2,Great until i washed it,I bought this bed and then i took the cover off to wash it and now the bed looks horrible!! the cover wont go back on the bed right!! the cover wont fit back on the bed and its sides arent standing up properly
5,A Deep and Spiritual Challenge to Any Reader,"Gary Thomas offers us a refreshing look into the lives of the historical saints. More than a biography or a book of history, Thomas takes their lives and applies them to spiritual growth in modern America. This is definitely a book you will want to purchase and read several times. Along the lines of Lewis' ""Mere Christianity"", Thomas intellectually stimulates the reader with sometimes humorous, often heartening, spiritual truths."
3,"A little tight for ""one fit""","I don't have an abnormally large head, and it fits a bit tight. Hopefully it stretches out a bit as I wear it. ""One Fit"" might not be the right term to use. Most flex-fit hats have S/M and L/XL, and I wear the L/XL. This hat fits like a S/M.Oh well. If it doesn't stretch I'll hang it on the wall or give it to a kid."
1,Disappointing,"Chinese food is my favorite, which is not featured in this book. How can anyone who writes about Far East ignore China? I wish she included a lot of Chinese food as well."
3,Urban survival? How about history of urban survival in war.,"This book is more about the history of urban survival, rather than a survival guide. The info contained within is very vauge. He uses more examples of what other people have done rather than teaching you what to do. What info there is, is quite good, but only a few pages of the book are usefull. If you can get the book used at a real good price it would be good to have just to give you a reference for what the worst case could be, but as a survival guide it fails to instruct on the techniques of urban survival in any significant manner."
3,Limited useful information,"I was a bit disappointed after I read this book. There is plenty of information and things to consider, but very little useful suggestions you could act on! The book gives you an good understanding of what it can be like living in a war zone, or an area where the government has collapsed, but if you're going to tell me not to do something in a survival situation, you need to suggest alternative courses of action. Ragnar just doesn't give you many suggestions and it make this book much less useful than it could have been."
4,Better than I expected...,"When I first saw this book I wasn't going to buy it. Too many of these survival books just rehash the same info just to sell a book. But I'm embarased to say because of the title I tried it. I was surprised it was alot better than expected. Ragnar really did focus on urban survival and used quite a few quotes, stories and examples from other real life survivors in urban invironments. This book is fresh compared to his last few books. Because of this book I'm going to buy his next book Survival Nursing. Benson was starting to get stale but he is back!"
3,Good Guide,User-friendly. If interested in the Rockies I'd suggest to go for the specific Canadian Rockies edition.
3,not as good as DE-LITE,"this cd has nice ideas and production. but i would rather listen to 70s or 80s dance music. deeelite, technotronic, and c and c music factory all kick basement jaxx arse.i mean it."
2,Don't believe the hype!!!,"I have listened to older freestyle Bassment Jaxx stuff and it was absolutely incredible. And when this album came out, I quickly snatched it up. I was dissapointed, to say the least, at the garbage that was on this CD. The R&B type beats and cheesy house style singing will almost put you to sleep. I think that they are an awesome group, but this CD doesn't do them any justice. Especially with all the hype about it..."
4,A pleasant surprise,"House usually isn't my thing, but because 'Remedy' really defies classification it's usually just lumped into this category for convenience. But there's a hell of a lot else happening on this CD. Of course, the big songs ('Red Alert', 'Rendez-Vu' and 'Jump and Shout') were what made Remedy big in the first place and will probably get you hooked initially, along with 'Always be there', which would have to be one of the most erotic songs of 1999. But it's the funky little touches (Gemilude, Sneakalude) and straight-out weirdness of some songs (Same old show) which will keep you snapping your fingers and singing along to your discman for months to come. Nice one."
4,this is fantastic!,i love basement jaxx and think that this album is a masterpiece. the outstanding track has to be bingo bango - a stunning piece of rhythmic salsa fun.
1,BASEMENT JAXX DOESN'T DESERVE ANY STARS!!,"I'm the kind of person who goes out and picks random cd's and usually I end up with a great new band for my collection but every once in awhile I pick up a bad egg and that bad egg lady's and gentlemen IS Basement Jaxx. IF this is the best of HOUSE music then count me out. Everything on this crappy cd has been done before. It's not original at all...it's generic techno at it's WORSE! Stupid lyrics, dumb vocals, and danceable beats add up to create a very UGLY sound. I realy can't understand how anyone can like music like this. So anyone looking for intelligent electronic music leave Basement Jaxx out. So in other words Basement Jaxx is a horrible HORRIBLE buy and I feel sorry for those of you that actually like this crap."
1,Absolutely unlistenable,"Knowing and kitsch and soooo achingly hip, so wink-wink more ironic than you are, an ugly and ungainly mash of diverse styles into music so deeply irritating I never want to hear it ever again. I tried my best. Gimmicks do not equal music."
4,Handy Youth Ministry Reference,"HELP! I'M A VOLUNTEER YOUTH WORKER! by Doug Fields is the book that started the complete HELP! line of youth worker books put out by Youth Specialties. The book serves as a great ""jumper cable"" to your ministry work. Fields goes through fifty different little ways to help you in ministry to jr. high and high school students. There are a few personal stories littered throughout, helping to drive home the points. Quite a handful of graphics are included - filling up a LOT of space in this 96-page book. The graphics look incredibly cheesy, and probably should have been replaced by more text. A lot of the material here is repeated in quite a few other books on high school ministry, but this is a great resource to have on the shelf - or to take along in the car to a retreat."
1,It's not elementary.It's not even entertainment!,"Based on some prior reviews I bought this. Boy, was I disappointed.Even though some of the other reviewers give away the plot and surprises, I thought I would enjoy this. All I can say is you have to be brain dead to be entertained by this. Gene Roddenberry would be very disappointed!Be warned: Data DOES NOT turn out to be Sherlock Holmes' arch enemy, Professor Moriarty.And yes, Data defeats Professor Moriarty before the professor defeats him.I think you would have to check your brain at the door to like this one. I really do not understand all the glowing reviews from the other customers."
4,thanx to the actors,"The story of this movie is rather flat but never the less the movie is very touching, if you're a teen: Drew Barrymore at her best."
4,Drew Barrymore's best movie,"...and probably chris o'donnel's best movie too. IT starts off as a very enjoyable movie at first, then it peels away it's cover to show a very sirious side. And in the process Drew Barrymore's acting is fantastic. If only she stayed that way instead of making worthless unmentionables like Charlies Angels. ANd Chris Odonnel is along for the ride. His quiet tempermental acting shouldn't work with Drew's fierce character, but somehow it does. The only complaint is that Odonnel is usually the same in all of his movies, and this one doesn't change. His just like he was in Scent of a Woman, but he's still enjoyable. A movie fan's favorite."
5,Excellent,"These pads perform as expected and seem well made. Though wrapped with a velcro strap it is not necessary to use it. They are light and take up less space than several 2x6's (product description states, 2.8 x 6.5 x 8.9 inches ; 2.4 pounds). I highly recommend them. They fit my trailers' stabilizers perfectly. Great price and value, at least for now, I will update if this changes. The waffle design can trap dirt and if that is a concern just turn them waffle-side up. The idea is that the stabilizers do not sink into the dirt, not to support the full weight of an RV. They do what they are designed to do."
5,In the mind of the drifter,One of the Uk's finest. No words can do justification for this mans talent straight out of huddersfield in Yorkshire every track is a master pieace taking you on a journey through the high plains so sit back and drift.
1,Not by Harry houdini,I was disapointed in this book because there is only a few pages written by Harry Houdini. There was also added material that had nothing to do with Houdini.Not Recomended
5,An Expanded Index,"As a research student in philosophy and a Catholic priest I have found this volume invaluable. It sits on my shelf next to my five volume 1950 Leonine edition of the Summa and acts as an expanded index. This is undoubtedly its greatest value: when seeking something in the Summa the ability to lift down this one volume, look for the appropriate text and check a summary of the Questions before turning to the real thing. I would additionally recommend it to all philosophy students and those interested in Catholic Philosophy and Theology as a text which can stand alone and whet the interest in this great thinkers magnum opus."
3,Goat Tree,"Out on the meadow the field goats like to climb up onto that bent old tree. In cyberspace the old critics like to climb up onto this bent CD. Problem being that we are measuring this CD up to Mu-ziq standards. No it does not have those lightning edged tetanic seizures. And the melodies don't have the haunting Paradinas groove. Yet throw ""Royal Astronomy"" into the electronica barnyard and it holds up as a good album. It is a thoughtful imaginative project. ""Autumn Acid & Burst your arm"" are tight and strong. But if your hungry for that vitalized futuristic semi-destructive Mu-ziq engine don't look here."
5,"For Americans, Katzner is simply the best.","This was my first dictionary, in 1987--and remains my favorite dictionary today. I have literally loved two copies of this dictionary to pieces. My current copy is the first dictionary I reach for if I need a quick translation. This was the dictionary that was always at my side when I worked as an interpreter in Moscow. Of course, it is not meant for every purpose, but I have seen nothing as good as this dictionary for its size. There is also a great quick-reference declension guide inside."
5,Great Reference/Resource!!!,"I majored in Russian in college and I used this exact English-Russian, Russian English Dictionary while I was in college. It is extremely invaluable and found it to be more useful than other dictionaries I had seen on the market at the time!!It is worth every penny and a must have reference book for anyone studying Russian!"
4,very nice up to date dictionary.,"My american friends wanted to learn the Russian language more in depth. i myself is from Ukrain so we found this dictionary and it is very helpfull. It has many words, the meanins of them and shows how to use them in a sentence."
5,Versatile AND Comprehensive,"I've not come across a more all-inclusive Russian-English/Englis-Russian dictionary since I've started studying Russian. Not only does it include a wide-variety of every day words, but it also serves as a ideal source for translating the more obscure terms. It serves its purpose without having to lug around a weighty hardcover version. In fact, I used this dictionary while taking a sociology class taught completely in Russian in St. Petersburg, and my professor was constantly asking to borrow my dictionary. She adored it so much, that I left her my copy!"
2,Daughter had no interest in these...boo!,"I was very surprised to find that my daughter wanted nothing to do with this sticker book. She loves stickers so I thought this would be a great motivational and rewarding tool, but none such luck. Epic fail. She literally could have cared less. Oh well, better luck trying something else. She literally got more excited to flush the toilet then put these stickers on the chart."
3,"Small Book, Big Surprises!","This book is small, not worth the price I paid, but overall it offers some good surprises. There are not that many recipes as compared to the other vegan cookbooks out there, but there are a few gems."
1,not what you think.,when you look at this book you see lots of veggies going in the slow cooker.what you get inside is alot of slow cooked fake meat.that is not very pleasing.
4,Refreshing citrus scent!,"I love the smell of grapefruit and found that tangerine is the perfect compliment. Soap foams nicely, rinses completely and does not dry the skin. Perhaps the most amazing thing is how long this bar lasted! Held up to a house full of kids and guests alike. A great value for the money. Treat yourself by adding this item to an order that needs that certain something to qualify you for free shipping. Enjoy!"
1,No page numbers!?!,"I just can't read any magazine that does not include page numbers! There are (SUPPOSEDLY) some interesting items I would like to know more about...but who has time to count to page 60...or 152...or whatever. Why list page numbers in the table of contents, if you don't bother actually putting numbers ON THE PAGE???! Although (thank God) the subscription was free (who would PAY for this???) I won't bother renewing, even at FREE, because it immediately goes into the recycle bin now. May as well save a tree. Ridiculous. How tough can it be to include page numbers? Frustrated, disgusted...Bloomberg...are you serious? Do you need to employ someone who can count?"
3,Bloomberg Business Week,"Content is OK, but print is too small, lots of glare from paper used.As a senior citizen I find that many publishers have sacrificed legibility in the interest of lower costs.I may have to cancel a number of magazines due to this issue. ""Time"" magazine is another whose print is far too small, so that often I need a magnifying glass!!!I sure wish Amazon would make all their magazine clients aware of this, and urge them to make changes to make the issues more reader friendly.By the way it seems far too many companies are resorting to such small print that it's hard to read many important notices etc."
1,Waste of time,Weekly magazines in the digital age really aren't all that useful--it's old news by the time it reaches your mailbox. The marriage of Bloomberg and BusinessWeek is no different. Business requires a faster turnaround time than what a weekly print publication can deliver to end users.
4,Great Submarine Story,"O.K,I admit,I'm a sub nut!!I have always enjoyed this movie.Real good story starring Charleton Heston as the skipper,Stacy Keach as his concerned commanding officer,David Carridine and Ned Beaty as the rescuers and a couple of other familiar faces I'm sure you'll reconize.A nuclear sub is out on test run and dives after a refit,gets rammed by a foriegn frieghter in a fog and the sub sinks in very deep water.A rescue is launched and it is trial upon trial to try to save the crew.For the nautical or sub nut,as I fit both catagories,I do recommend this movie.The special effects are old timie(not a typagrahical error!),but very good for the times."
2,Gray Lady Down,"I really like this movie, but could you release it in widescreen. This movie really needs to be viewed in it's originalaspect ratio, as it was quite wide."
4,Works as advertised,"I'm surprised by the poor reviews here for the DataSend CD. This product does the job Magellan advertises. If you are a pilot, the CD has airport locations you can download. If you have the GPS 315 and want to download the nautical NavAids that the GPS 320 has, you can. I use this program to download the interstate exits. Then I can see how far I am from upcoming exits when I take long trips. However, like all of the software from Garmin and Magellan, it is priced a little too high."
5,teaching math,I love love love this book.It is rhythmical and mathematical.It is also good length for my 3 year old son.I really recommend this!
4,Gen-turi for Gen & Agua-hot,"I purchased two Gen-Turi products for our motorhome, one for the diesel generator and the second for the diesel aqua-hot furnace-water heater. The product and installation instructions look great. When I use both stacks an additional section will be required for each as my coach is rather tall (12+ ft) and fumes may enter the ACs and other roof vents. I have also added heavy duty suction cups (100 lbs ea ""overkill"") for stabilization. For now I'll only use one Gen-Turi at a time with a section from the other. Nice product from Amazon with a reasonable price!"
1,i had to stop reading,"well, i just gave up for the third and last time on this aviation manual... i had to see what the reviews said to confirm my disdain for this book and author. the saying goes , ""write what you know."" and martin caidin no doubt knows all about aviation and aeronautical machines and blah, blah, blah... but why is that supposed to impress me when i'm reading about Indiana Jones? i agree with all the negative reviews. the characters are underdeveloped, even though they are introduced with three pages of descriptions. Indy is uncharacteristically callous. it's hard to imagine martin caidin has even seen the movies. maybe the whole of it would have worked if the names had been changed, and you like reading textbooks. but in my opinion caidin should not have tried his hand at indiana jones. i will not bother at all with The White Witch.i should mention.. i've enjoyed every other book from this series until martin caidin stepped in. sorry marty."
1,Worked for about 6 cleanings,"It worked great for about 6 cleanings. After about 6 cleanings over the past year the Bissell Pro cleaners water bucket no longer seated very well. The suction dropped off to about 50% and I had to put weight on the bucket in order to suck up the water. That fix worked but then the REALLY CHEAP floor attachments broke. Yes, just when I needed it most to clean my stairs, the THIN and poorly designed floor suction attachment broke and would not spray water very well and it started leaking air where it cracked. It's been too long to get a refund so I'm throwing this one away and am going to try a hoover. I'm in my 40s and can work my way around most mechanical problems but I can't thicken cheap plastic parts. Bissell, your product engineers need to be fired!"
1,I am very unhappy,"I bought this product July 30, 2004 and used it twice and it already smells like something is burning when i turn it on. I am very disappointed in the product and there is no place to call to see if there is a warrenty on the product. I would rather go to the store so I can take it back if it dont work. I know there is nothing I can do about my experiance, but maybe I can help someone else."
1,"blah, 2nd one w/ same problems!!! don't buy","Purchased one several years ago. It did as well as a Hoover steamvac yet this one leaked most of the time. The tank always leaked during use and the selector knob broke making the attachments useless.Got another one, duh!! and again similar problems.This time, upon start up the wand sprayed me in the face and stuck 'on' for several seconds. After some creative banging, it finally shut off. Then when I tried to use the floor suction, it wouldn't spray solution or water. Like the old one, it leaked some during use and the solution never really got any hotter than the tap. Lastly, when shut down, there was always water coming back out of the wand or the floor piece creating another mess.taking this one back and will look at a dirt devil or hoover."
1,I thought it was broke!,"When I saw this toy it looked like it would be so cute so I bought it for my baby. Coming from Sassy, I thought it must be good. Boy, was I disappointed. You pull the string, put in the water and, it just sits there with the string going back in. I thought we had a broken one until I read the other reviews and they all said the same thing. Sassy should be ashamed putting their good name on such a poor product. It really isn't even worth 1 star, but you can't give 0 stars. If I could I would definitely give this loser of a toy 0 stars. How disappointing coming from a company who has won toy awards on so many other toys!"
1,Bad service,"This book was ordered on Sept.4, 2008. The shipping info.indicated the latest date I would receive the book was Sept.26, 2008. It has not arrived. I cancelled my order with Amazon on Sept. 29, 2008. There were no explanations offered by the seller."
5,Outstanding camera and service,"The camera arrive as described with all the necessary accessories, including the NIKON instruction booklet. I started taking pictures immediately. This was an excellent purchase. I saved tons of money and a lot of time running around to buy accessories."
1,Did not work well with my mac,"The hard drive was not what i expected. It didn't work very well with a mac even though it claimed it was mac compatible. I did not like the product, although I do think WD makes some of the best computer components on the market. I ended up having to return the unit because it was ejecting itself for no reason and I couldn't even get any data into it. I went with the simple smartdisk firelite and found it to be perfect for a mac."
2,232 GIGS?,"You have got to be kidding me. 7% of the advertised space is missing?Where did it go?The hard drive came with some back up software, that was free to try for 30 days. After deleting that and formating the drive I was left with only 232Gigs. Why did I get charged more than 7% of space for tax?"
4,good,nice product - i like th sync in feature with windows - am disappointed that they don't have something like that for mac too.
2,Do not recieve what was ordered,"I ordered a ""black"" Passport Portable 250GB Hard Drive, but I recieved a ""white"" one instead without an explaination. Notwithstanding this the product is working fine and I have back-up information from my work and home computers all in one place"
4,Good for storing precious photos,"I take many pictures. I was worried that something might happen to them on my computer so now they are all transferred to the hard drive unit. It worked great and I had none of the problems listed in some earlier reviews. I am not a technie and I figured out how to use it. The instructions are quite limited and not very helpful, but it worked fine and made sense after I just tried a few things. With this hard drive, I feel more secure. We are going to buy a fire safe and store this hard drive in it and I will feel even safer!"
1,Nothing special,"I own iPod for 8 month and very disappointed with it. What I dislike:- sound quality is terrible, equalizer produces distortions- all accessories are very expensive- Russian font is very bad done- can't use national characters in contact- short battery life- no digital out- for line out you need a dock- remote is very basic and no LCD- no development sdk- no Ethernet- can't edit play lists without PC- can't set bookmark- last played song and position forget after sync- no support for ogg, wma, and falc"
2,"Love it, but the battery makes it unacceptable","I love my iPod. I love the way it works, and have had no problems with the iTunes software or the sync mechanism on my PC. It's great. The amount of music it holds it fantastic also.EXCEPT - the battery is unacceptable. My commute is one hour, and even after full charges (left in the cradle overnight) the power is gone by the end of the commute. ONE HOUR! No help from Apple support, either.Not worth it. As it is now, I have to figure out how to use it - it's hard to be limited to one hour worth of portable music.They really need to do something about this."
2,ipod must die,"My ipod froze several days after I got it causing me to reboot. It kept freezing every day from then on, the battery life sucked, and by the end the music playing from it sounded hollow and basically, the thing crapped out. Ipod sucks, apple sucks, and I am gettingthe Rio Carbon when it comes out.I suppose I might have just gotten a lemon, but for $300 apple should have better product control. So if you are in the market for an ipod....beware!And one more thing, everyone is getting the ipod, making me not want to be like everyone else in a sea of white cords and ear buds. Am I alone on this???"
3,PC users beware,"I recently bought a 20 gb ipod from Amazon. The Apple people seemed to clame that it connected to windows just fine...which it doesn't. First it doesn't come with a USB cord, which is the easiest way to connect the ipod to windows. Then it was close to impossible to find one of these USB cords. I ended up getting firewire for my Dell. Even that was hard, if you buy a Belkin firewire port, make sure you can connect power to it. I had to buy to different ports before it worked. Once I got past the hastle of connecting the ipod, I loved it."
3,"Big Price, Cool Case, No WMA Support","It's newer. It's cooler. It's way hip, but it still doesn't support WMA playback leaving Windows users to install new software and rip their music into yet another format. I've checked it out, and have decided that I am saying ""No"" until the iPod sincerely supports Windows."
2,beware!,"Before you shell out $400, keep in mind that the iPod's recheargable internal battery is fixed, that means that as with any other Li-ion battery, after approx 300 cycles you are left with an expensive white, apple-branded paperweight, since you CANNOT replace the battery. But of course by that time you may be already hooked to it and then you will buy another iPod and make Apple richer, thats their business strategy.If you have had a laptop for a while you know what i am talking about, after 1 year of use you usually need to replace the battery cuz it doesn't last too long."
1,Junk,"The ipod is nothing more than a glorified storage device. $400 for nothing but the ability to be tied to iTunes!I asked my friends what player to buy and they all said iTunes is ""awesome"". Well its not. If you use napster this is not the player for you. You'd be better off just buying a Gateway keyring mp3 player for $100.If you want to shell out $400 the Samsung Napster player is the far better choice with more features and the ability to tie into the Napster online music experience.Also the ipod looks cheap as its made with plastic. Some people like these things, but I for one think its all wet."
2,not too many feature for the price,"I have tried this player in personsounds is not so specialthe control is not that hard, but somehow the dial is too easy to move, that may make some mis-operationthere're 2 things I don't like1. no .ogg support, after found the high-fidelity of .ogg format, I made thousands of them to replace mp3s I made, alas, this player don't support2. no recording feature$399 is way too high with fewer features, I personally not recommend, no matter the cool look, function and support are more important for me"
2,PC users should beware,"I've revised my initial rating after a few days with my iPod. Right now, I dislike the device, but haven't given up on it yet. It worked great until I tried to install it on a second computer. The installation was torture, freezing the computer several times. When it finally looked like I was going to get it installed properly, the battery died. I'm suspicious of advertised battery life claims.Now it doesn't work with the original computer either. When I attempt to sync, it just hangs, flashing the stupid Do Not Disconnect warning for hours.Maybe it's because I'm running Windows 2000 on one machine and XP on the other. Maybe it's because I've got USB 2.0 rather than Firewire. Whatever. iPod is not as PC-friendly as it ought to be."
3,My heart goes boom,Good song for summer holidays and young kids. That's all. Won't go to the Music History books.
2,Wow - ashagre at it's best,Wonderful music- it is truly a blending of all different styles of music with a a beat that is so contagious it'll make you smile all day long. Not one track disappoints!Looking forward to their next cd.
3,Could have been much better,"Here is a novel which has a great idea and is simply poorly executed. It deals with H.P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard, who after writing to each other for a long time, finally meet in person. The reason for this is an ancient artifact, which comes into Lovecraft's possession - an artifact that holds the key in preventing the ancient god Cthulhu from entering our world and destroying it. They set out on a journey which leads them to meet with a hooker, who will play a vital role in their quest. They are followed by a black car with two mysterious men, who it seems are the servants of Cthulhu. Very boring at times with too much useless dialogue, this novel never really scares and the only interesting chapter is the next to last. I give it three stars for a great idea, which unfortunately was poorly executed."
1,Not exactly a Nobel Prize winner,"While the author does well at writing descriptive prose regarding the details of furniture and antiques, he does not fare as well with characters. Many plot points are disjointed, and some are incomplete. The reader is made to feel quite distant from the story and often wonders if there will be more to it eventually, but there never is. The writing is simple, and could benefit from a going over by a professional editor. The descriptions of people and things are vague; one wonders what makes something ""most beautiful"". Better descriptions of what the author is trying to convey would benefit the reader greatly.Great works of literature require development and refining, which this work does not seem to have. The author would do best to keep this in mind for future manuscripts."
4,Required reading,"A revealing and very well-written book on America's history of meddling in world affairs, full of historical revelation and insight. Avoid the audiobook version of this; I don't know the name of the person chosen to read the book but his absurdly strident intonation turns it into a joke."
1,Vet approved???,Onions can cause Heinz's Anemia in cats. I would not take my cat to any vet that approved feeding onions to a cat. This book has dangerous recipes. Spend your money on better book.
1,Junk Food for Cats,"I didn't buy the book and I won't. I searched inside and saw all kinds of flour and bread being used in these recipes. Good grief, why are we feeding cats things they haven't evolved to eat? No wonder so many cats are ending up as fat and diabetic as their owners."
2,Useless,There are no serving sizes per recipe of by weight of cat. Calories are missing. How can I feed my cats a healthy diet without this vital information?
3,Good introduction to VaR,This is one of the first books about VaR and so became widely used and read by everyone interested in market risk management. Good as an introduction and to have a good overview of VaR but if you need more detailed information this book will not give you the answers.
1,The DVDs appear to be defective,"I remember seeing this movie as a kid, and really enjoying it. (I'm Irish, so of course I love movies about politics.) I wanted to add it to my permanent collection. But the first DVD was defective; it stalled about an hour into the movie, and nothing I could do could get it to continue playing. I tried it in two players, and on my computer. I contacted amazon.com and they sent me a replacement. The replacement was even worse! It started stalling in the opening credits. I notified amazon.com again, and they surmised that it would be pointless to send me a third disc, because it would probably be defective too. Both discs have been returned to amazon.com. So, in short, I'm sure that the movie itself is just as great as I dimly remember it, but amazon.com's vendor has apparently supplied a defective batch of discs. Once this problem is worked out, I will gladly try to order again."
1,Great Movie- Rotten DVD,"I was one of the first to get this defective DVD back in April 2010. I hated to give a bad review, because at the time I reasoned that the problem is with the studio and not Amazon. However, here we are 10 months later and people are still posting that the DVD is defected ( the same can be said for the offered version of ""Cold Turkey"" which is also a part of this series). Please do not order this until Amazon can guarantee the quality of the DVD, otherwise your going to spend a lot of time at the Post Office sending these back!"
1,"Great looking, didn't fit",I just completed a guest bath reno using the Kohler toilet (standard with chrome handle) for which this ORB handle was designed. It was exactly what I wanted in terms of color and finish but it didn't fit properly. I returned it to Amazon requesting an exchange for a new one on 18DEC12 and am still waiting for the new one to be delivered.
5,HJ golf Glove,"The glove fit perfectly and feels extremely comfortable. In addition, it remains soft and pliable after washing. Color assortment and styling are the best in women's golf gloves and makes a nice fashion statement."
4,Missed for a long time!,"I originally ordered ""The Best of Lighthouse Sunny Days again"" because I missed the music! (Blood, Sweat & Tears & Early Chicago Sound) Unfortunatly, my two favorte all time Lighthouse songs where missing from this collection. So, when ""Sunny Days"" came out at what seemed at the time a high price, I ordered ""Sunny Days"" the CD of the original album. I did this so that I would be able to listen to ""Beneath My Women"" and ""Merlin"". These are my favorite all time Lighthouse songs. Was it worth the price? You bet!!!!! Life is too short to miss things that money can buy!"
3,better left at the arcade,"I like this game mainly because of the guncon. Other than that I would leave this game for the arcade. Unless you can beat story mode all at once, it gets annoying having to play the same levels over and over. Some of the enemies (such as the ones with flamethrowers) are annoying as you lose a life as soon as you try to shoot.The game is fun, but I would leave prefer to leave at magic mountain (where I usually play it) rather than buying it."
4,Christmas gift,I got this model for my grandson who will be putting it together with his Dad. I think he will learn about the plane and the war it was in while doing that. The past is important.
2,Not a very useful book for wildlife artists,I purchased this book based on the review above and the cover art. I was disappointed when I opened the book to find that the majority of the information in the book is presented in text format and is not very useful to me as an artist's reference. Some of the plates are interesting but I would not recommend buying this book if you are looking for an artist's animal anatomy guide.
2,never got it.,Never got product. yes i was charge back for the item but they ran out or something but did find out about this until a week or so later!
4,It's all around you,"If an Electric Sea had a soundtrack that would play every time you went swimming in it, this would be it. Tortoise taking a little more electronica dub approach with this record. Still mellow Tortoise, but not so much bass drums xylophone and guitar, this time it's mostly synths and computer samples and stuff."
2,"Great idea, doesn't hold up","I was initally impressed with this slicer. However, after one month of use, the welding in the center section has popped and the entire center slicing section has shifted. This causes incomplete slicing of the apples. The blades have dulled in the month since I received it too. It seems to me the downward pressure applied has a direct affect on how the metal slicing blade hold up. The harder the apple you slice, the less amount of time it will last. I sent mine back for a refund."
5,Good choice.,We are all Cowboy fans in our house with one exception. My youngest daughter wanted a new shirt like her sister's but in a different color. This is identical to the grey I purchased . Prefect logo and excellent quality T for the price. I would recommend and probably will purchase other items in the future.
3,Ok for the price,"This cable is kind of shorter than I thought it would be but if you only use it for charging your controller than it's a good buy, but if you want to play and keep it charging while you're playing, then you should either sit closer to your t.v. or get a USB extension cable which is what I did."
4,Good Alternative to the Name Brand,This play and charge kit for the Xbox 360 is a pretty good alternative to the more expensive Microsoft brand. It doesnt fit as snug as the name brand but works just as well. The light functions differently but works well. Definitely a suitable alternative and works great. So much better than using disposable batteries.
4,Interesting.,A friend recommended this to me because I was having problems with my new kitten chewing everything including wires..sprayed some on and she stopped...it's a true lifesaver. Thank you for carrying this.
2,Bitter Apple,Can not smell bitter apple. Pretty sure it is not working as cat still cratching on sofa. Does not seem like a smart purchase item.
1,False and biased,"This book, even though stylish and interesting, present a blatant distortion of facts. I, personally, doubt the fact that the book is truly a translation of Mirza Jamal Javanshir Qarabaghi's notes, who is claimed to be an ethnic Azeri historians. In fact, there is no person under that name seems to be known as historian, or writer in Azerbaijan or Iran.The undeniable fact, that Armenians moved into Karabakh region of Azerbaijan only about 150 years ago is hidden in this book. Instead, the author misrepresents Karabakh as ""ancient Armenian land"". The book is just another product of Armenian propaganda. Another attempt to rewrite history and justify the crimes of Armenian military against Azerbaijani population of Armenian Republic and Karabakh region of Azerbaijan."
4,"Fun game, but a little hard.","Over all, this was a fun game. But as my title says it was hard. I think that most people will get stuck on leval 2 as I did. (Hint: if you get far enough before time runs out you beat the leval.)With 14 fun levals it's a good game."
1,Repulsive,"I wish I had a ""zero stars"" option. I'm amazed at the number of readers who loved it. Perhaps they are also fans of the horror genre. The premise for the pottery glaze turning red was nothing short of nauseating. The image will linger with me forever. I wish I'd never read it. I was taken aback to find something so graphic in the Qwilleran series."
4,Feast on this one!,"The sixth ""Cat Who ..."" book, this one is the first that I found a bit creepy, but it's a still light enough mystery for those like me who don't like graphic violence or psychological chills. Jim Qwilleran goes on a diet and almost immediately gets assigned to write about food and moves into a boarding house of gourmet cooks! He manages to lose weight anyway, and of course solve some murder cases."
1,interesting concept--miserable product,What a disappointment.I reccomend that you save your hard earned money and simply buy a $0.79 cent roll of adhesive tape from the local chemist.
2,Huh?,"I really was interested in this book b/c it comes with a DVD. I don't understand moves very well just looking at pictures. Unfortunately, a lot of the moves in the book are not on the DVD included. He shows how to do a takedown from the clinch, and a few other things but I can't remember.Also be aware that there is a lot of controversy regarding the legitimacy of this guy, check any MMA or BJJ forum. Nothing personal against the guy, but I haven't read anything positive about him - but I could be wrong so glean from that what you will. You would probably be better off buying Cesar Gracie's set. It costs more but it's worth it."
3,"good, but basic","The book is ok, but there's nothing there that you wouldn't learn in the first couple months of training. So, if your just starting out it's useful."
3,Not exactly 'complete'.,"This was my first poodle book...accompanied by my first poodle. It's limited in scope and calling it 'complete' is not accurate. However, it was sufficient for starters."
2,Worth reading if you can get through the bias,"This resource should be read with a critcal mind. The maps themselves are very well done and informative but the commentary by the other is incredibly, and sometimes comically, bias. I just finished an extensive university course on the history of the Israel/Palestine conflict that used this book and our class found it to be highly misleading. It is incredibly slanted towards Israel and would be a detriment to someone who is just seeking cursory knowledge about the conflict. There are two sides to this story, but in this book it would seem that there is only one."
3,FITS ALL FULL SIZE TRUCKS,"NO, it does not fit my avalanche. the tailgate will Not close because it hits the top rear panel and will Not let the tailgate shut. Also, the screws they send with it, Really, what a joke. The screws are too short,the first time i stepped on it the screws wanted to pull out. No, i am not over the wieght limit :-) The screws head strips out Very easily too,not usa grade! I never said the step itself was no good, it seems very sturdy,just doesnt work on my truck :-)"
2,"""Turquoise"" No","The little pie plate is a good size, but the color shown is completely wrong. The two-tone color shown is not the color. The turquoise is more of a solid greenishjade like color. I was quite disappointed, but the quality is there and I did get a good price. I would send it back, but would probably get the same thing again. I have never been disappointed with anything from Amazon, so this is the first."
5,Wonderful,"Since we are 'empty nesters', I wanted a small pie plate and this one fits the bill.It arrived promptly, too."
2,"No, Pues no...","Pues la verdad, despues de haber escuchado varios covers y en especial el tributo ""100 Tears"", realmente me hacen dudar de la calidad de estos grupos. Yo se que las bandas trataron de hacer lo mejor que pudieron, pero la verdad es que no se puede comparar a las versiones originales del grupo. a las demas personas qu aqui han escrito, se emocionan porque en su vida habian escuchado algo así, por los que les recomiedo se integren al movimiento de musica en español, y asi conoceran grupos mas reconocidos y por ende con mas calidad.."
2,A book prepared in hurry and difficult to read,"The book is written by an academician, maybe with engineering background. It uses unnecessary mathematics symbol systems and cumbersome explanations to narrate simple concepts.It appears that the book was published in a hurry. It contains many typos, for example, on page 5 -figure 1.4(a) (Note the there will .....). Can not believe these types of errors were not caught in the review by AP publisher.The book was given some high ratings from some readers on Amazon. I do not believe these ratings are compatible to the ones given to similar books such as the book ""Introduction to future and options"" by John Hull."
2,A Few Facts - A Hundred Myths,"I was tempted to think the author had fallen in love with Boulez and wrote this book in an attempt to explain frustrated emotions.As a biography, it is only a little more useless than John Baxters execrable biography of Stanley Kubrick.It contains a few interesting facts though."
2,A Step Backwards,Through thier first four studio releases the listener can chart musical (and perhaps emotional) growth in the Eels music. Shootenanny makes me wonder if E's songwriting inspirartion has dried up. Maybe it just disappeared with his beard. None of these songs stand out as anything more than standard rock progressions with alternatingly grim or cliche lyrics.I'd come to expect alot from Mr. E. - Maybe he'll take his time with his next record and and put a little more heart into it. Or maybe he's just peaked and will spend his remaining days riding the coat tails of his past accomplishments.
2,ugh.,"i'm admittedly biased towards eels songs that are quirky (eg-novacaine for the soul, i like birds, etc.) or depressing (just about all of electroshock blues) or both and this album just didn't cut it for me. i really thought that even though souljacker was a little poppier than mr e. had been in the past it still was some of his best stuff and (unfortunately for me) because of this i had expected that he was headed in a very interesting direction. shootenannay is instead corny and way too upbeat. i want my clinically depressed mr. e. back. this album may be well put together but to me it just sounded uninspired. of course, like i said, i am a biased fan and it might have actually been very inspired but, to me, it was only by a bunch of sunny emotions that don't make for good eels music."
3,Tarzan,As a youth I enjoyed the Tarzan books along with many other series. I'm glad that I've found the series and maybe in a attempt to relive my childhood am reading some of the books. They aren't the nail biters I remember but I find it nice to be able to reread them.
1,Same wheel problem,"Same problem as the previous reviewer. What a bummer to try to assemble it Christmas Eve night at 9:30 to find one of three wheels is defective. Sadly, sending it back."
3,Fun........,"Great toy but It is fun for the first five minutes. It can get very boring. However it does take thinking and was a great ""educational"" toy for my 5 year old son."
5,A Classic Toy !,I was so happy to find that the Etch a Sketch is still available. I thought it was a toy of the past. I bought one for my coffee table at home and everyone that comes over plays with it and reminisces. It's a great toy for all ages - especially for creatives.
5,Come on... Love it!,Really? If you need to read a review on this toy you need to buy this thing right now! Classic toy here. One of the all time best.
2,Disappointing,"I bought this toy for my son's 4th birthday. His birthday is tomorrow and I just opened the package to wrap it and I'm wishing I had opened it last week! Already I'm disappointed! The screen is much smaller than the version from my childhood. I could live with that. But, the part I'm not liking at all is that the lines don't completely erase. I wrote a large ""E"" on the screen and no matter how much I shake it the ""E"" is still visible. This toy may be going back. I'm not happy thus far."
4,Misleading,"The fact that it says Tips(plural) would indicate you get atleast 2, that is not true, you only get one.I dont have much of a problem as these are cheap but just so everyone else knows, you only get 1 per order."
1,Inaccurate information,The author's views of historical events do not matchup with Quranic stories and mainstream Islamic teachings. The author's words may lead a person to an inaccurate interpretation of Islamic history.
1,Crap!,"I purchased this for my 9 month old husky. She broke her collar, chewed threw two harnesses, and wiggels out of her third. So I got this for when she is outside. She broke the ring that connects to the chain. We only used it once! The only piece I could find was the broken ring. I searched and serached to find the choker to see if I could fix it, but ti was missing. Dont waste your money."
5,Great product,"My phone needed a new battery because the old one would no longer hold a charge. Some of the feedback for the sellers on Ebay made me leery of buying from them. Still I didn't want to pay $25+ for a battery purchased locally when I could get it online for much less. So, I decided to try Amazon because I have never had a problem with items I have purchased through them. I received the battery quickly, charged it, and my phone is in tip top shape now. Couldn't be happier with this purchase! My advise is, Just Do It!"
2,Have to recharge the battery after two days,After two days and about ten minutes talking I have to recharge the battery.I don't think it it original battery. When the phone was new with original battery I could charge once in 5-6 days.
1,Won't Hold a Charge,I ordered 2 cell phone batteries and niether one of them will hold a charge for more than 5 hours.
1,Chosen. Really?,"Well, yes, Chosen means there is a contingent of 'writers' who label themselves as lesbians and think they are 'chosen' and therefore can define the genre by pumping up their reviews with illusion. LOL. Would that the world were SO simple. This book like so many other's, speaks to a certain minority, in a clique, who self reinforce their views with their positive reviews that have NOTHING to do with reality. Tisk, tisk, Ladies. Some of Us know what you are doing. In regard to the book: not original, not particularly well written."
3,Enough is Enough,"I just finished reading the last of the series, I enjoyed the story part but enough is enough. I got so truly tired of reading about breast feeding, engorged breast and being bedded. If she had cut most of this out of the book it would have been alot smaller and more enjoyable. I don't believe anyone on their deathbed would be interested in sex! I almost put the book down but was 3/4's through it.I hope the next one put more into the story line,the characters and a little more from Scotland."
2,What Happened?,"I began this book with great anticipation. The story of Jamie and Claire has been an amazing adventure up until this point. I confess I am disappointed. The author seems to have gone off on a tangent and never returned. After having read a portion of the book, I stopped and put it aside for other books. I pick it up occassionally, hoping that I will get to the part where something is actually happening. So far, I have not reached that point. I adored the rest of the books in this series and feel quilty that I have such a poor attitude toward this one. I'll keep trying, but I am beginning to dispair."
5,Outstanding,"This is an excellent book but not for the squimish. If you don't like the nitty gritty facts of life (which are all natural and we have all experienced) like vomit, blood, and feces, then don't read this book. Overall it portrayed a very realistic and entertaining account of colonial life. You definately have to read the previous books in the series to be able to appreciate this book. It was great to see how sexy and romantic Jamie and Claire are in their middle age. The book leaves you waiting breathlessly for the next installment."
2,Enough already!,"Someone said that a pessimist is never disappointed. I waited for Diana Gabaldon's ""The Firery Cross"" with great optimism based on my pleasure in reading all privious ""Outlander"" stories. ""The Firey Cross"" is a great disappointment. Perhaps if I longed for the sensation of burping a baby or changing diapers I might find some pleasure in this book. Or, if I didn't mind that the main protagonist, Jamie Fraser, is almost a minor character my enjoyment might have escalated some. Basically, the book is about 600 pages too long with a story plot that plods laborously. Gabaldon reports that the writing of this book involved taking chunks of writing, separated by lengthy periods of time, and pasting them together. That is exactly the feel of the book. I will await the next in the Outlander series with a greater degree of pessimism."
2,A Thousand Page Disappointment,"I loved the Outlander series, and waited eagerly for this next volume. I was hugely disappointed. The book is laden with excrutiating detail and events that do not contribute to the development of the plot (which was only vaguely present) or the understanding of the people involved.. The first 200 pages describe the events of one afternoon! Frequent references were made to characters introduced in prior books, without the gentle reminders that most authors of series will give you. I was racking my brain to remember these people and how they fit into the story and the lives of the Fraser family. I gave it a valiant try, but I just couldn't finish the book. What a huge disappointment. Save your money and your time."
2,Extremely disappointing,"After reading Ms. Gabaldon's previous four novels, steeped in rich Scottish history, with the intrigue of Jamie and Clair, this book was a complete waste. I bought it two months ago and just now am completing the last 30 pages. After much anticipated waiting, I am extremely disappointed. It simply does not hold the readers attention. The characters are stagnant, the book is too long [by about 800 pages], and there is little historical value. I do hope Ms. Gabalon gets back on track, it would be a shame for this saga to simply fade away."
5,damn fine!,"ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!! I couldnt wait to get my greedy hands on this book! It was nice to see that Jamie and Clare are finally settling down- for now at least ;)Ppl who are complaining about having to read about other characters- other than Jamie or Clare are twits, they are not in another plane of exisitence separate from Jamie or Clare, so deal with it! It's nice to see things form different ppls respectives."
1,Finished at last,"I started this book on November 5th, and finished it today, December 20th, 7 long weeks of forced reading. It's been a long time since I have forced my way through a book this boring, especially for 979 pages. After having devoured the previous 4 books in days, wishing that the story would go on forever, this one did, unfortunately! Although I will still wait eagerly for the next volume, I will drop it like a hot potato unless it is significantly better than this one! What a disappointment to have another formula writer run out of material."
4,Where did all the passion go!!!,I read most of the reviews before I actually read the book and I can honestly say that people were expecting to much. I liked the book(even though it is a slow read). I agree with others about too much details about Jemmy.The only other problem I had with this book is that there is not that much heated passion as in the previous books (note to Diana* Please try and recapture that heated passion for your next book). It was a breath of fresh air that Jamie and Claire didn't have to much drama in this book. I think that this book is a great setup to a more exciting future book(I hope).
1,"No plot, and not for the lactate-intolerant","I've read the first 4 books in this series one after the other, with no books in-between, and would rate all of them 5 stars. So I was expecting this one to be similarly excellent. Sadly, this huge book can be described in one sentence---at least the 300 pages I waded through: ""The Frasers lived in 18th century North Carolina."" That is the plot. Period. But what really made me put the book back on the shelf was the endless references to Brianna's breastfeeding. Okay, once or twice: I get it. But it's seemingly on every page. So...if you want boring details about 18th century life in North Carolina, go for it. You're interested in all aspects of breastfeeding? Be my guest. Otherwise, don't waste your time."
5,Awesome Book!,"The book was absolutely wonderful. The series is one of the best I have ever read. I have read through the series at least 5 times and enjoy it more each time. I would recommend that anyone who hasn't read it, should start with the first one - Outlander. Awesome!!!!!"
3,Doesn't stand alone and detail over load!,I'll make this short and sweet - take a lesson Diana Gabaldon!The book doesn't stand alone well. You need to have read the other books in the series or pick up the companion. I read all the books in the series but got the companion out of the library anyway and it was very helpful and interesting.As with many of Diana's books there was a bit of a detail overload. But you get in the rythm of scanning over the descriptive paragraphs and getting to the meat.
3,Why can't I get into this one?,"That is the question I keep asking myself every time I pick up ""The Fiery Cross"".Unlike the first four books in the saga of Jamie and Clair Frasier (which I read voraciously, barely taking my hands off of them until I was finished) this fifth installment is just not as engaging."
3,Gabaldon should not be abridged ...,Gabaldon's writing is so descriptive it is really a waste to hear it cut down. Take the time to either read it or listen to the unabridged book.
2,Abridgment to the extreme,"This may be a good book but the Audio Book version does not reflect any proof of it. I've never been a fan of abridged books and this audio further inforces that attitude. Events and story lines seemed to just flitter in and out with out much lead in and a much faster exit. Being a fan of the previous 4 book, which were listened to on tape, I expected a much more continuous story line of the main characters. If you listen to your books via tape or CD, skip this one. Read, or find someone to read the book to you. I would hope the book is better than the Audio version."
4,Very enjoyable,"OK, so I have read through the other reviews and can see some basis for the complaints, but honestly I enjoyed Fiery Cross a lot. I'm an addict of this series (well, I ordered the book in May for the October delivery date) and couldn't wait to get my hands on it. Once it arrived I read as much as I could, anxious to find out what is happening next but sad because the pages were flying by and the end was coming too soon. There are several ""page turner"" moments in this book where I couldn't believe what was happening and had to find out the outcome. I'd recommend the book and can't wait for the next one!!!"
2,Boring!!!,"As an avid fan of Jamie & Claire et al., I was greatly disappointed in the Fiery Cross. I am still having trouble getting through it - I think I am into chapter 7 or so after having the book for about two years. Its as if Diana Gabaldon didn't write it because it lacks everything that made her other books successful - interesting adventures, fabulous character build-ups and great plots that tie together. I look forward to her next book and hope that it gets back to what we love about the Outlander series."
4,I NEED the next installment!,"I was obsessed with Jamie and Claire for about 2 months. Yes, it took me only 2 months to read all 4 original books. I literally couldn't put any of them down. I had them with me at all times so I could sneak in a quick page or two at work or in dead stopped traffic. I waited, very impatiently i may admit, for this book and it satisfied me, but only for the moment.Diana really outdid herself with detail this time. Granted, I still couldn't put this one down either...but I kept wondering why there was so much seemingly useless (and endless )excess detail. She seemed to concentrate more on everything OTHER than Jamie and Clair in this book....which leads me to believe that the next few installments will focus on Roger and Bree's life together.I realize she does alot of research so her descriptions are accurate. But come on Diana! All we really want to hear about is Jamie and Claire...and now Roger and Bree! We don't care about Aunt Jocostas 6 chapter wedding party!"
5,great 5th installment,This book was wonderful! I loved the transition to early American history and to Claire's daughter. I can't wait for the next book!
5,Awesome,"Diana Gabaldon has a style of writing that is appealing to many people. I love the characters and you can't help but dream of a man like Jamie. Keep them coming Diana, I never saw myself reading this type of genre but, I'm finding myself looking for the next book as soon as I've finished reading one. They are great, highly recommend reading!"
2,Boring,"I loved this whole series of books, but I think this series should have been wrapped up a few books ago. It felt like she was just making this book up as she went along. I had to almost force myself to keep reading it in hopes it would get better. I hope this will be the last book in the series, even if it is not I won't be reading any future editions."
5,A great Book!,"The Fiery Cross is everything a Diana Gabaldon fan could be wishing for. The book is a near 1,000 pages long & still when it ended I began longing for more. What can you say about this book? ...Jamie is still our wonderful, sweet hero. The main focus is still on Himself & Claire, we watch as their love continues to grow & expand, along with Brianna & Roger, who we get to know them as a couple. Diana has again showed her unique sense of humor and her extraordinary hold on matters of the heart. I enjoyed reading about Brianna and Roger and how their lives entwined in Jamie & Claire's, yet managed to build their own style of relationship and marriage.I also recomend The Price of Immortality by C.M. Whitlock. Amazon is offering it with The Fiery Cross."
2,Don't get too excited about number 4,"Firstly, I loved Diana's other books, hero-worshipped Jamie (like everyone else) but...I am sooo bored with this book. I take it to bed at night, and after about 2 pages am asleep, it has now taken me about 3 months and I'm only a quarter of the way through, and I am only reading the rest in the hope that it may improve. I feel Claire & Jamie's relationship has been dragged out to the bitter end, and to be quite honest, I don't think I'd be very upset if a wild Grizzly bear broke in and killed them both (it would be a bit more exciting). Who is interested in the sex life of two people around 50 years old, settled & happily married! Boring."
5,The Fiery Cross Continues the Saga,"This is awesome, it continues the saga of Jamie and Claire, in such detail. What a wonderful author Diana Gabaldon is!"
3,not up to the rest of the series,"Enough people have talked about the content that I want to comment on the format of this book. It's extremely annoying that the publisher has decided to bring out a trade paperback of this book, making it impossible now to have a matched set with my mass market copies of the previous installments. The paper is really cheap; I understand this is a very long book, but if you're going to do a trade paperback edition, do it right and make it a quality one. That's the whole point of a trade paperback! All this is simply greed on the publisher's part, and if anyone from Delta is reading this, I hope they take it to heart."
4,The Fiery Cross,"I liked the book ,but, not as much as the first two. This one is too repetative ,and it left me with to many questions at the end. It seemed as if the writer was in a hurry to finish. What had happened to Ian ? Will there be another book about Claire and Jamie. They have become part of my life and hope to read more of these two. The next, could answer all the questions about Clare and Jaime , Ian and Jenny ,Will Jamie see Scotland again, or his sister and what about William? I ordered the next book about Lord John, But truley hope there will be another about Claire and Jamie..Looking forward to the next book. Thanks Mrs Gabaldon !! An Avid fan....."
2,not good,"The first 3 books were really good. This one is just too long and boring. I read it and I can't remember a single thing that would stand out. It's all blah blah blah, life is hard in NC, some stuff happens nobody cares.I think Diana's run out of ideas for Claire's adventures."
1,"For the love of God, someone find this woman an editor!","Just as I suspected, the fifth book in this juggernaut proves what I've said all along -- Outlander would have been a fabulous trilogy. TRILOGY. That's three books, Diana. With some astute editing, we could have gotten Jamie and Claire to their graves, with page-turning romance, adventure and history packed into each book. I mean, did we really need Mr. Willoughby in Voyager? That's a long way around the block for a little acupuncture. Drums was a snore, and Fiery Cross is ... practically unreadable. I had to grab the new Nora Roberts just to cleanse my palate."
3,disappointed and yet...,While I was disappointed in 'The Fiery Cross' I still have to say Diana Gabaldon at her worst is still better than most writers at their best. The writing gets five stars but the plot momentum was sadly lacking. There were moments that I saw glimpses of Gabaldon magic- when Jamie calls to Dougal for instance. The last couple hundred pages were great and really kept me turning. However I did feel a tad cheated not to learn anything about why Ian had returned. Sigh...guess I'll be getting the next book. For those of you waiting for the next installment however I highly recommend 'Exit Unicorns' by Cindy Brandner. I bought it due to a previous mention on here and absolutely loved it.
1,"Tedious, with too much description, dialogue, and detail","This book is a dissappointment after reading Gabaldon's first four. What I liked about her prievious books was the adventure and fast-paced interesting story line. This book didn't have that, at over 1400 tedious pages would have been better if edited to say, 700 pages.Much of the book is devoted to description, and endless threads of babies, nursing, and domestic life. A little description to support the story is needed, but there is so much in this book that it really couldn't hold my interest.Also, I thought many threads weren't plausable. The whole of the Jemmy thread could have been edited out. The Jamie snake-bite saved by penicillin that Claire made wasn't believable. The book builds to a climax and final confrontation with evil ship captain Stephen Bonnett. But that doesn't quite work and the baby Jemmy is definitely in the way and brought this thread down.I really didn't like this book and would not recommend it to anyone."
1,The Fiery Cross,"I have loved all of Diana Gabaldon's previous books in this series, however, this book was boooooooooooooring and was almost impossible to finish. I did finish it, though, 'cause I didn't want to have wasted my money. I was completely disappointed in this book and hope that the next in the series is better. I'm glad I'm not alone in my judgement of this latest installment."
1,Not worth the wait!,"I awaited this book for almost 5 years, even rereading the first four in the series this summer to refresh my memory. I am totally disappointed with The Fiery Cross.Claire does nothing but complain about her life for most of the book. Jamie has been made a minor character. I really do not care about the ins and outs of breast feeding and potty training a child. Story lines were also started and dropped, without being taken to there conclusion. We are to assume everything turned out alright because no mention was made of them again.I will read the next one whenever it comes out, hopefully sooner than five years. We can only hope Ms. Gabaldon warms again to the characters, for if not it will not be worth the time or money to read it."
2,Extremely Disappointing!,"In my 47 years of reading, I have never encountered someone who could say so little so beautifully. I give one star for the beautiful writing, and one star for the approximately 1/5 of the book that was riveting. The scenes about the hanging, the snakebite/buffalo, the wild pig, and Jemmy's paternity were ""couldn't put it down"" quality. But who needs to wade through proclamations in Old American English vernacular? It was painful. What Ms. Gabaldon needs is an editor that isn't cowed by her fame and can say ""enough already."" As far as I'm concerned, I'm going to eat right and start exercising so I can live long enough to make it to the end of the series."
