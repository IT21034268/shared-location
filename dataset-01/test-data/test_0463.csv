5,Lifesaver!,"This book is a must-read for anyone currently interviewing (or trying to interview) for this field! It helps spice up your resume and helps you get through tough phone interviews (the worst!). This book really did help me get my first pharm sales job last year, and I'm loving every minute of it. I gave the book to my sister, and now she's getting calls left and right for interviews. It really helps, even though it was pricey, and I've more than made up for it with my bonuses!"
4,Very useful book for the interview of phamaceutical company,This book about interview of phamaceutical company is very useful for me.Thank you for your fast delivery.
3,Not all that great but impressive,I'm not that big of a Christina Aguilera fan but I was sure that I'd like her versin of the Christmas classic. I was disappointed to find a Remix of the song when we don't even know of any original. The remix partially ruined the sound of the song and if they at least included the original version it would prove how good she possibly could sing the song. I was pretty glad to find a remix of her past hit Genie In A Bottle though.
1,The IDEA of her performing this song...,"Christina A. [I'll just call her that, ok?] has a limited range [to match her likeability] and her style has been pop ballad to Britney Spears-style beach-radio. Her attack [it's an assault] on ""The Christmas Song"" is both laughable and disturbing. Mel Torme, forgive her, she knows not what she does."
2,Permanent filter doesn't hold up,"I bought this humidifier because I was trying to avoid the expense of constantly replacing the filter. The so-called permanent filter was a mess after 3 months, and the company was unable to replace it."
4,Good deal,"I like this humidifier. I felt it was a good deal for the price. It is a little noisy on low, but its kind of like white noise - you get used to it."
3,Vendetta,This book was the most anti-climatic out of the Devil's Cove books but still an enjoyable read.
3,Eh,"Not terrible, but not the easiest read and a tad difficult to follow along with. Seemed to go out of order or jump around a lot. I would recommend the Unofficial Guide to Planning your Wedding or The Dummies Guide. Or better yet, do what I did and check them all out from the library first, and THEN decide which one to buy"
3,Much darker than previous seasons,"The final season of CSI Miami is darker and drearier than previous seasons. I'm not sure why they went this direction, as I personally always enjoyed the almost humorous tone to some of the shows. This time around, Horatio is still the changed man, willing to beat up prisoners or let them fall to their death. I found that particularly telling, as I remember an early season where he scrambles to save a child molester/murderer so he can stand trial. This time around, he watches the child creep fall to his death. A new Horatio (as of last season). I don't mind that, but the shows weren't particularly interesting or well done."
4,CSI Miami Final Seasn,Have not had a chance to view it yet as I ordered many new DVD's but it appears as described
1,"CSI: Mindless, great DVDs, lousy show.","I love the whole CSI family! However, as with every family you always have that one relative that no one wants to see show up at the family get-togethers! This would have been a great addition to the franchise except for two things, a lead character that can't act and only has three poses, and a story line that can't seem to stay on the winning track of crime investigation and instead routinely veers off into soap-opera territory. We live in one of the few areas that still do not get cable and there are too many trees to get satellite reception so we buy videos and online episodes. I bought the first two seasons of Miami hoping they would live up to their sister shows standards only to be drastically disappointed. The quality of the videos (DVDs actually) is excellent, so if you like this show then do buy them."
5,WOW! Better than the first!,"Finally it is out :) Another well written, enthralling tale! Like ""Reflections in the Nile"" it starts off with a very thick read, but soon pulls you in so that you can't stop! Much darker at times than the first, and with a more psychological thriller feel, ""Shadows..."" was an eye-opener. And as a male reader, I appreciated the action involved too. Buy it, take the phone off the hook, and block out some time...."
4,a fascinating take on the Atlantis legend,"If you like time-travel stories, this is certainly an excellent example of the genre. The author has definitely done a lot of research, and has created two delightful protagonists in Chloe and Cheftu. Which leads me to why this doesn't rate 5 stars--too much time spent on peripheral characters, and not enough on our hero and heroine! Pages would go by with no mention of the protagonists to the point where I wondered when they would return to the story. Aside from that, this is a very good series, and I'm looking forward to the next volume, which is due in August."
5,Jesus would approve!,"This book is perfect for both current and future stay at home moms. I'm a 53 year old virginal, stay at home daughter, so while I don't have children yet, I am always on the lookout for books I can use when the Lord and my father decide that I can marry and fill my quiver with arrows. Jesus would definitely approve of this book written by a godly woman that shuns Satan's Brew (AKA Diet Pepsi) and enjoys a good burrito. I'd give it 666 stars if I could!"
5,A must for any metal/old school Staind fan,"I loved Staind from Dysfunction. Too bad their music has gotten overproduced and crappier as time goes on. After releasing Chapter 5, these guys should just give up. Like any other typical rock sellout, these guys have amazing roots. This entire CD is an amazing piece of work up there with debut albums like the Korn self title and Taproot's first. This is a pretty hard, emotional, and awesome CD. It never lets up and also never disappoints. Too bad Aaron Lewis has made so much money now where he's happy and their music has become soft and is garbage anymore. I recommend this album to any rock fan who is looking for a great piece of metal history to listen too."
4,pup toy,"Was initially happy with product until I saw how dogs could destroy it in a matter of seconds! Cant' really blame toy... dogs are big chewers. It did last a few days, but went the same route as all the tennis balls I have provided them. Good for a non-chewer or smaller dog... I have labs."
4,"Great Toy, though not super tough.","My dog loves this toy. It it big, strong, easy to tug or throw and she loves the way it bounces and squeaks. The other reviewers are right though, it is not tough like the regular KONGs. Definitely not a chew toy, she started pulling on the fabric and from then on it became a dog+person only toy. When she starts to chew I trade her for a chew rope or other chew toy."
5,Nonstop Reading,This book is wonderful. I couldn't put it down. Jessica did it again. Can't wait for her next release.
2,I tried..3 times,"This was my first time reading something by this author and after reading all the five star reviews I was expecting it to be a pageturner, but I couldn't get passed chapter 4. To me, the story was all over the place and the characters were not developed at all. This is my first and last time reading something by this author.I wouldn't recommend this book to avid readers."
5,CLASSIC!,"This book starts out simple enough, Killer Croc (A long-time foe of the Dark Knight) has kidnapped the son of some rich capitan of industry type, and Batman can't have that. Not in his city. But after saving the child, and defeating Croc, Batman realizes that Killer Croc was not the mastermind, and the kidnapping of the young man was only the tip of the iceberg in a plot to test the mental and physical limits of Gotham City's Dark Knight! This title (which is only the first of two volumes) is an excellent mystery which keeps you guesing as to who the real mastermind is. Writer Jeph Loeb, and artist Jim Lee have created the best saga in the mythology of Batman since Frank Miller's '80s classic ""The Dark Knight Returns"". The ""HUSH"" storyline features appearences by all of the best Bat-Villains, and is DEFINATELY a must have for any Batman fan, or any comic book fan at all for that matter. In one word........ CLASSIC!"
2,Biased report,"This book is way too biased. Tha book reads as though, the British did everything, the Americans took the credit. The British are good codebreakers, but a better balance of historical facts would have been good."
2,biased history,"this book only gives the british of the story, story which involvrd modtly US organizationsthe british have been first class breaking enigma, they don't need extra unwarranted congratulations for their work on Japanese codes"
2,Meh.,"Scottish romances are my favorite, and this was my first Hannah Howell. I did not enjoy it. In fact, there were several times while I was reading it that I was certain this review would read ""I only read part of this book"". The story was not engaging and the characters dissected their ""relationship"" from every possible angle in every paragraph on every page - without ever actually moving it along. First she loves him but first wants him to love her, meanwhile he loves her but first wants her to love him. No one discusses it and no one acts on their true feelings. Bored already? Throw in some action-less ex's drama and there you go.My shirtless Highlander recommendations: Paula Quinn and Michele Sinclair."
2,Meh,"I was really excited to read this book, it got such good reviews. Howell's diction was great no doubt but the story was really slow. I almost didn't finish it, I even skipped pages and didn't miss anything of importance. It just seemed like a lot was happening in the book but nothing was really going on...if that make's since. The story just seemed to start dragging about have way through the book."
4,And a hot wolf he is,"Hannah Howell was my first experience with historical romantic fiction...specifically 15th century Scotland. To say I was hooked would be a profound understatement. In the period of two weeks I bought ever book by Mrs Howell with the word Highland in the title. (a rough estimate was about 20 novels) The language was fluid but authentic yet didn't take away only added to the story. Especially the dialogue...who could have thought that words like...aye, wee, lass, bonnie and nay could be so enjoyable? While the main premise of the story is historical romance there are ""wee"" sprinklings of paranormal...which is my genre of choice. Mrs. Howell also does my favorite thing to find in books, characters that span several books.First as the protagonists then as secondaries in others. In the Highlands they are kinsmen or clan members. Loved it so much. Buy it you won't be sorry."
5,A great video presented very well,"This movie has totally changed my opinion about the WWF and Vince McMahon himself. This movie begins with a look at Bret Hart's family and his dad, the great Stu Hart, and it continues into how he got involved in the WWF. As the film progresses, it shows how Bret Hart was lied to and double crossed by WWF owner Vince McMahon. I think any wrestling fan would like this video, not just Bret Hart fans. Since I watched this movie, I have an all new respect for Bret and the entire Hart family."
2,Maybe why scratch cooking got lost,"My mom cooked from scratch and passed away before most of her recipes were known. I couldn't wait to get this book to get more down home recipes. I wasn't thrilled with the presentation but the proof as they say is in the pudding. Note, that this is not a book for a novice. One recipe says to make the cookie any size and cook for 10-15 mins. In cooking, size does matter. Next recipe says cook chicken until done. Doesn't say how to test for doneness. It says use chili sauce with no recipe for making it. Isn't that why you bought the book for the ""cook"" to tell you times and full recipes. Although it's a lovely tribute to his mother and is a nice momento for his family, people shouldn't be fooled, BBQ sauce takes more than 15 mins to simmer. The food is good but there are other books where the food taste great. Needless to say I don't use it anymore."
5,Good condition and fast delivery,My son needed this book for college and didn't realize it till after the class started. This was sent out very quick and we had it in hand by the 2nd week of school.
2,Overpriced pistol target,"Know that old saying, ""you get what you pay for""? It's not always so.Copies of this book sell for $150 in places. That is ridiculous, seeing as it's less than an inch thick. It's supposed to cover centuries of music theory, yet each principle is explained vaguely and with few examples. If you want to get a really good step-by-step on Western music theory, take a look at Clough and Conley's ""Basic Harmonic Progressions,"" which will give the reader a solid working knowledge of basic music theory (""basic"" meaning the core of functional harmony). Unless you have a music class where this thin little book is required, stay far away from it. If I'm not able to sell this book back at the end of this year, I intend to take it to a target range and dispose of it properly. It will be the most expensive target I've ever bought."
1,Defending the Slobs,"In other words, dress like a slob! A foolish book that attempts to apologize for and defend the ""causal"" look."
4,Great performance,Thus is the first live album. Not the best quality but good enough.and for the fans you need to have it.its probably the first and last.
1,Is It Really Love?,"I am disappointed that the song ""Is It Really Love"" was not on here. That's the song that was played in the nightclub scene in the movie ""Innerspace"""
3,Magic treehouse audio books,I thought I was ordering written books and was disappointed to find out otherwise. I'm sure the purchase will be redeemed as it will allow my grandsons to read along with the printed books to increase speed and comprehension. At least that's what I am telling myself.
4,"Yah, just get it","Ok, I would give it 4 1/2 if I could, but can't so I will round down. If you are learning SQL or are going to in a class room, this is a GREAT way to start, even before you start taking lessons. this book will break up learning into ""10 minute"" lessons, which the first few can be done thourghly in 5. (Possibly because I had already learned it but oh well). Anyway, if you go through every lesson seriously, you will walk away with a GOOD knowledge of SQL, take it from someone who uses SQL in the field."
4,Give it time,"My first reaction to this book, having bought it without the chance to look inside, was nice pictures, extensive travelogue on places I'll never go, not worth the money. At that stage I was just getting into saltwater fly fishing. I have had this book for a year now and it has definitely grown on me. The information is pretty good, except you don't know that until you go fishing, come back, and read it again, then it clicks. And the content has application to any flats fishing. The photos, spectacular to start with, sink in and begin to captivate and (this is the worrying bit) you start analysing the content in detail, eg for reels, flies, shirts, packs, boots, and any other detail that might help. Okay, the captions to the photos could use some editing and maybe the text could too, but I find myself returning to this book time and time again - expecially through the winter - when other books are getting dusty"
3,Cuing problems,"I agree with the reviewer who indicated the clothing/costume can make it difficult to see how to do the moves. With a basic understanding of bellydancing, or by doing the tutorials, you can learn the moves that are in this video (although it would be easier with a different costume choice on the part of the instructor). The instruction isn't great, but you can get an idea. However, the main problem I had with this video is the lack of cuing. There are move changes and direction changes with little to no cuing. It's difficult to follow, so I mainly just use the tutorials for practicing the basic moves. There are much better videos out there, so if you're a true beginner, spend your money on something else."
3,It's ok,"Sorry, I really wanted to love this, but for me it was a bit hard to do, I'm not very good with choreography I guess."
5,I'm actually looking forward to exercising because of this DVD,"I won't get all detailed since I see a reviewer has handled that but I will say I LOVE IT! I am very overweight and it has proven fun and challenging all at once. Because of my size it's not always easy to do these workout DVD's but this one is so fun and sensual you are enjoying it and feeling sexy and before you know it the tape is up and your muscles hurt and you are lightly sweating. I know eventually I'll have to add cardio but this is a nice way to ease back into the exercise world and being I love dancing, this is perfect."
5,Fantastic - and not necessarily for beginners,"This dance/workout is not necessarily for beginners. While the instruction aspect of the video may be for beginners, an intermediate dancer can turn on the music-only option and just dance. Most of the moves are pretty slow, but effective nonetheless. The slower and more controlled the move, the more tone I get.Sarah's shimmies are fantastic, Blanca is very sensual, and Neon knows how to make her moves pop. Good job ladies."
1,Not for Beginners,"Luscious - The Bellydance Workout for BeginnersThis is not for beginners--you can't see their feet, they go to fast and they get caught up in their performance that they forget it is supposed to be for beginners. Don't waste your money-- Rania has some better DVD's out there that are really great for beginners.I did break a sweat but it was because I was trying so hard to keep up and I still was confused and lost. I never knew if my feet were positioned right or not because I could not see their feet. These people should give people who bought this DVD back their money because they misrepresented--it is not for beginners! It is for the advanced--probably those who took their classes."
4,fun french music,"I had never heard of this group until my girlfriend took me to a gig they were playing at her school, and I was suprised by how catchy they were. they did a fair number of cover songs (including 99 red balloons, which was excellent), but none appear on this album. I picked up this cd after the show, which was over a month ago and I still keep listening to it. Celine Dijon does most of the lead vocals, but Jeanluc Retard def holds his own on One Night In Paris (not about the city..)tracks worth checkin' out:L'AmantLawnmower BoyOne Night In Paris"
5,Mary Alice Monroe does it AGAIN!!,"When I discovered the writings of Ms. Monroe I knew I had come home. She builds her novels with characters full of life and its lessons. I was enthralled with ""The Beach House"" and have given it away several times while keeping a copy for my own bookshelf. Now I have done the same thing with ""Skyward"". With each novel we learn about the thread that Mary Alice creates, ""Beach House"" was about loggerhead turtles and this time with ""Skyward"" we learn about the birds of prey. I was so moved by this novel that I immediately sent a donation to The Center for Birds of Prey in SC where Ms. Monroe volunteers. Keep the wonderful novels coming, Mary Alice!! BRAVO!!"
2,Amazon GET YOUR FACTS RIGHT!,"Like the other reviewers here I was disappointed that the trackslisted were not on the album .I bought another Album from Amazon (the Original Best of Johnny Cash) with ""Chicken in Black"" and ""Boy named Sue"" etc and listed as included and GUESS WHAT ! They weren't on that album either.If you want these tracks get ""Boy named Sue and other story Songs"" $6.68So far obtaining these tracks has cost me almost $100 dollarswhen I could have taken the cheap option and got the $6.68 album in the first place"
3,ORNELLA MUTI..........STUNNING!,"Summer Affair. I had never seen it before buying it, only on the basis that I'm a big fan of Ornella Muti.The film was not bad, very early 70's, I didn't really expect the film to be fantastic, but I wasn't really disappointed either.If your a fan of Ornella Muti then I suggest it's worth having in your collection, although the only thing I thought was ''what the hell'' was her voice is dubbed over, other than that, Ornella is just stunning as always."
4,The best purchase I have ever made !,"I just have thank the seler for this, It is a wonderful movieThank youMaria"
2,"Hallmark - 5 stars, Story - 2 stars","This being a Hallmark film, I can say that the production values are FIRST RATE - crisp photography, good performances and impressive attention to period detail. Unfortunately, it's the Mitch Albom story that is the big problem. The theme is hugely belabored and is just too over-the-top in its determination to be a ""three-hankie"" tear-inducing experience. And it is LONG - God, is it long!! Clocking in at 2 and a quarter hours, it begins to try one's patience after an hour, if not sooner. I've concluded that Mitch Albom is just not my cup of tea; I recall reading ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" and, far from being moved, found it morbid and maudlin and about as subtle as an anvil. Five People you Meet in Heaven is marginally better, but I'm done with Mr. Albom's tales, thank you very much."
5,GREAT DOUBLE LIVE CDS!,"LILLIAN AXE IS BACK WITH A GREAT DOUBLE LIVE CD HERE.....JUST BOUGHT IT, IT ROCKS! 21 SONGS ON IT.....BECOME A MONSTER, LETTERS IN THE RAIN ARE MY FAVORITES ON HERE......THIS IS A VERY TALENTED ROCK BAND....I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ALL THEIR CDS....ITS REALLY COOL TO SEE THIS CD IN ALL THE MAJOR STORES... ALL AROUND GREAT CDS.....LOOKING FORWARD TO THE HOUSE OF BLUES SHOW AUG.31ST IN NEW ORLEANS......"
3,Just ok.,"This paper is ok. Not what I would use again. I am very picky about card stock. I want it to be bright white, take glue & water without falling apart or showing marks. Smooth for printing and take ink well. I do not give this paper top marks."
3,She's at Radio City Music hall,"I love Liza. Was glad to see this one now on DVD. But, it looks like a 1:33 version stretched to widescreen. But, a few adjustments on my TV corrected it and made her look less fat-legged.Halfway through she is on stage with what looks like the dancers from the Radio City Music hall where it was recorded. Aren't they called the Rockettes?Well, that made the show and Liza sings ""New York, New York,"" while the other gals do a parody of Liza's songs while Liza looks on in amazement. It is on Amazon and hopefully some of her other concerts will soon be available too. I haven't bought Liza With a Z, yet. I keep forgetting to look for it, knowing it has been issued on DVD."
5,Nothing like time traveling back 25 years.,"This is good stuff. I forgot how haunting ""Soldier in the Rain"" was... and still is.Would that someone would still make this kind of music. Beats all the ""I'm mad at the world, I'm gonna kill my mother"" nonsense out there."
5,"Hey, riot67!","If you like the music of the 70s, buy this cd. If you don't, then instead of calling all the music of the 70's ""pap,"" stop buying the cds. It's simple enough for even riot to figure out. (You'll see riot's reviews on at least one other 70's music cd...with the same complaint).If the music brings back happy memories for you and no blood is drawn, enjoy!"
1,revised feedback,I ordered the book The Feeling Good Handbook. The book was recieved when they said it would be. Once I got the book it was not in the condition that I wanted. But the seller did take care of the problem and it has been resolved. I would order from him again.
4,ahmyers,"This was a great DVD of early Mariah. Small setting with close audience interaction. I own almost all of her DVD concerts and this one was great to add to the collection. Anyone purchasing this, will not be disappointed."
5,For every aspiring dancer...,My Granddaughter who is big into dance loved this gift. It is nicely crafted and a real keepsake. This makes nice gift for any of those who have children/grandchildren involved in this art form.
1,"um, wow","I bought this CD after reading a bunch of rave reviews on here. I mean A LOT of good, excited reviews. I love the song Barry sings on the Juno soundtrack and was looking for more of the same. I popped the CD in the van and my husband looked at me like I was crazy. We both thought the CD SUCKED BAD. Now I'm mad that I even wasted the money on it - times are tough you know! I should have just bought another of Kimya's discs, they've been worth it so far."
4,Very good UPS for Dell systems,"As noted in prior reviews, it is a little loud (fan noise) however, I found that after a while I don't even notice it. As to function, it has responded flawlessly to several brownouts / short interruptions in power. I have a Dell Studio XPS purchased at the beginning of 2010 and found out the hard way that the regular UPS I had (TrippLite Smart1500LCD SmartPro UPS) would not function due to the requirements of the power supply in my new PC. I read several articles about replacing the power suppply to overcome these problems, but decided that the wisest choice was to replace the UPS with one that provided true sine wave output that my PC expected. I have not been disappointed with my selection. I moved the old Smart1500LCD to one of my other PC's with less demanding power supply expectations, so I don't feel I wasted my prior investment."
5,Great read!,"I've been in a bad slump lately when it comes to books. Nothing has really captured my attention. Until Tuff.Great writing: funny, raucous, surprising, sweet. Tuffy is the new superhero of Spanish Harlem."
3,Tuff is Tough,"Tuff is the story of a young man's transformation from a hopeless youth to a man who is willing to try a new way of life. We read the book in a book club and our feelings about the book varied greatly. One member liked how ambitious the characters were in their quest to make money. Another member liked how Beatty forced his readers to question their stereotypes, by constantly placing the characters in unexpected roles. Another member liked how Beatty gives a vivid account of what the less fortunate, when faced with obstacles, are willing to do to improve their living situations and the living situations of people around them. Overall, our book club would reccommend the book."
2,hard work,"this book completely threw me. it starts ok but before long we're thrust from what appears to essentially be a humourous satire into something that's stagnant and disorientated. i have no doubts in my mind that paul beatty is a clever man but this just didn't grip me. if i start to read something i have to finish it but this was difficult. the man character tuffy can't seem to make up his mind if he's good or bad. neither can he seem to make up his mind whether or not he's a rascist. don't read this book unless you absolutely have to, and you'll never absolutely have to."
2,poor quality,When played the CD skipped in a couple places. Forgot where I got and didn't have time to complain anyway so I just threw it out. Waste of money for me.
5,Da kine story make me yearn for Island Life!,I grew up in Hawaii so reading about the one of Hawaii's heros takes me back to the island life. A good read for anyone that has experienced living in hawaii or anyone who has the love of the ocean and surfing.
3,Good but not exceptional...,"It is a really beautiful book for introduce someone to William Blake's enchanting and magical world, but at the same time it's wrote in a way which remembers much a ""school text"", at elast to me, I studied Art History and reading this book was like reading a chapther back in my high school years about Blake... a little impersonal... but overall, a good introduction"
2,OK earbuds...Horrendous Cust Service!,good sound (not Great!); OK fit(somewhat uncomfortable); always popping out of your ear(s); heavy cord; left earbud malfunctioned after only two months w minimal use; cust serv was horrendous from the executive offices to tech support; WAY TOO PRICEY FOR MEDIOCRE PRODUCT
2,Do Not Buy!,These things are horrible. Here's why:1. They hurt your ears.2. The sound quality is awful! The music sounds very distant and quiet.3. The cord is short.4. I can't stand the awkward way in which you must wrap them around your ears.Do not buy these headphones. I for one am returning them.P.S. It may just be the fact that I am trying to replace a set of Bose headphones.
1,Horrible fit and sound!,"After reading all the reviews...I brought these expecting greatness. I was so disappointed. First of all, I can not keep them in my ears. I switched out the different ear pieces, but NONE fit in my ears. When they are in my ears (assuming that I don't move around too much, I can hear my myself breathing and swallowing. I feel as though I'm underwater! And each time the cord of from the ear pieces move, I makes an odd noise inside my ear. I hate these earphones..."
1,Warning! Fragile!,"Be aware that the ear-plug portion of the earphone is attached to the plastic body of the earphone by a very narrow weak plastic stem. My stem broke somehow in my pocket. I will see if Shure will replace these...the design could definitely be improved.The sound in the one remaining earphone is great, by the way."
5,grandma's sweater,"this is a book you can't put down, so plan on a quiet place with time to indulge yourself in a wonderful excursion thru the lives of people you may know in real life. you will be moved to laugh and cry and feel really good at the closing of the last page. you will love the journey."
3,A good story,"Seems that Red Dress wanted to get out of the 20-somethings, every guy who sees me loves me pattern it has fallen into and offers this -- a story about the other woman. And the author pulls it off quite nicely. Usually you don't want to root on a cheating hero and his mistress, but the story unfolds nicely -- albeit a bit too predictably at times -- into a happily ever after. We hope.The author's voice is fresh and although this is definitely more BritLit with it's references and terminology, it's a good, quick read."
3,"Not great writing, but definitely great fun","I'm not usually into ditzy romance books, but a friend of mine made me work up a bit of an appreciation for them. I have to admit, I didn't want to put this book down; despite never having been in such a bizarre situation, I was really feeling for the main character, and a lot of silly jokes and situational humor kept it light and funny even when you almost want to cry with pity for her.The bad thing about this book is that the author has no idea what she's doing. She writes in an omniscient point of view that is absolutely chaotic, changing from one character to the next in the middle of a paragraph, leaving me constantly confused at times as to which character an article ""he"" or ""she"" is referring to.But, as I said, the author's mistake didn't ruin the enjoyment of the book at all, and if you're in the mood for a cute, silly, quick read, I would recommend this."
3,A new twist on the oldest story in the world.,"Man and woman get married. Eventually they drift apart. Man has an affair.Who's the heroine of this story? Usually, it's the wife. But in a delightful turn of events, this time you're rooting for the mistress. The beauty of it is, you still feel some sympathy for the wife. And the cheating husband.Jane Sigaloff's book is original and really honest in its emotional conflicts. You believe in the love between Lizzie and Matt, but you also know what they're doing is wrong. The flipside of this story is that Lizzie's best friend was once the wife in a similar situation and this fact only causes more interpersonal conflict.It's a wonderful story, but the Brit Speak can be a little too much at times for Americans not familiar with it. Hence three stars instead of four."
4,You won't be disappointed,"Name & Address Withheld should be bought, not checked out at the library. This book is worthy of entering your chick-lit collection. I fell in love with the characters...well most of them. I was not very fond of Lizzie's flatmate, but I did fall in love with Matt and Lizzie. This book has some strange spelling and I'm not sure if it is correct in Britain but I found it rather annoying. I live in America so I didn't know if it was normal for British English. It is not like Red Dress Ink to miss such noticable misspellings so I assume it was meant to be that way. However, this book will be one of those up all night reads so get to the bookstore!"
4,satisfied,"This paper indeed has 10 squares per inch, just as advertised. I would recommend this paper to anyone needing graph paper with 10 squares per inch. I think it is a bit overpriced for what it is. I just bought it because I needed a small value item to arrive at a purchase total qualifying for free shipping. In hindsight, I am not sure that makes financial sense, but there you have it."
2,I'm sorry but I have to say...,"...that this album is just not a masterpiece. I couldn't help reacting something to all those comments that praise Williams to the skies. Not that I hate him. No. This music is simply overrated. The themes are repetative, the whole scorewriting approach is dull, seems uninspired. James N. Howard or Thomas Newman could have been the ones to be invited to write a music for this movie. John Williams' style of writing seems to be out of date sometimes. This music sounds like as if it had been composed decades ago. You won't possibly be thrilled by the sheer beauty of this score. It simply has almost none."
4,Buena pelicula,"Buena pelicula de horror, del tipo de: ""Hostal"" o ""Rec"", si quieren salir del clasico terror Hollywoodense, les recomiendo la pelicula."
3,"Twisted movie, slow start though","Builds to a pretty disturbing climax, but to be honest the beginning drags quite a bit. Lots of twisty weirdness to keep you somewhat off base on what is going on until well into the movie.. pay attention at the beginning to have the end make more sense. Have a strong stomach if you watch this though!"
3,WOW! Not For The Faint Of Heart,"This movie was wonderfully acted and directed. But, this isn't some more for the average Horror Film Genre. This movie is really brutal and not for the faint of heart. I give this movie 3 stars as it truly stayed on topic, but, the English Subtitles weren't in synch with the English translation and the subtitles weren't fully on par as well. But, thank goodness for the option of not reading the Subtitles. The sound and picture quality were great. If you are thinking of purchasing this movie, I recommend it simply because it's not your typical horror flick and is really dark and brutal. This movie delves into a world of true brutality, though I don't condone violence against women."
3,Horrific Horror,"If you like horror films, be prepared the imagery that you will witness is gruesome and sickening that at the end of the film you will be numb from it. This type of horror comes mostly from physical abuse, child torture and from all kinds of pain that can be inflicted on the human body. The central theme is revenge and this vendetta tale starts early without letting up, there are at least four gruesome murders in the first 20 minutes if I correctly remember. Although this movie had a pretty okay story line, the pace slackens a lot in the middle. The ending had a interesting premise and makes you think. Just three stars for this one 2/18/2011"
1,Martyrs - waste of time - zero stars (have to put one to post),"I'll keep this brief. ""Martyrs"" is ninety minutes of torture porn and five minutes of milky special effects representing ""the afterlife"" and some horses**t justification. It concerns a group of people who torture young girls to the point of death so they can try to see what's on the other side. One girl does make it, after they skin her alive, to tell the old biddy behind it about the special effects, only to have said biddy kill herself for no apparent reason but to provide a ""twist"" ending. I'm not adverse to strong movies - I highly rate ""Salo"" and ""Irreversible"", but it's nice if they have some genuine thought behind them. The only horror behind this movie is that it's stolen ninety-five minutes of my life I'll never get back."
3,The feminists are going to have a field day with this one!,"This movie goes beyond shocking. It disembowels you!I don't know where to begin. Well, let me first say that this movie really abuses women. So if you're a feminist or someone who doesn't have the stomach to watch women getting abused in a way that goes beyond Jess Franco, then pass on this one.There's blood, there's self-mutilation, there's flaying, there's beating, and there's mental torture. Hey, how's that for a horror movie.I don't think I can write a proper review of this movie without spoiling it. But let me assure you, it's not what you think. We makes assumptions and that's normal but this movie is anything but.Watch it alone first and then decide if you want to invite your friends and loved ones to share the experience with you.Good luck."
2,I read the negative reviews only,Before I decided to watch the movie I only read the 1 star reviews.I believe if I would've read the positive ones first I probably wouldn't have watched this movie.. I was hoping to feel the way the 1 star reviewers felt but I didn't... I was borderline bored because it seemed like i saw the plot/scenes countless times in other movies...The only part I found disturbing were the beatings and that's only because I was reminded of the physical abuse a close relative suffered at the hands of her husband.Other than that eh... I'm still on the hunt for the perfect .. give me nightmares... afraid to be home alone.. afraid of the dark.. horror movie.
1,Dalton,"Ellen Grae is always telling those crazy stories about people she has knownm, such as the man who was asphyxiated because he kept his car windows closed in the summer so that people would think he had an air conditined car. THen she meets a boy named Ira......when ira tells ellen the story about her parentsand what happened that day in the swamp. Ellen had never herd a story like it...so ellen continues to tell these weird and exiting stories, but no one belifed her. Ellen goes on an trip in a small town called ""Thicket,: trying to determin what she should do about Ira's bad news. She also had to make a decision somewhere between ira and telling people about iras terrible secret....."
5,The vital reality of dreams,"This book, although based on years of research and unbelievably inexpensive, is a gift to those who want to know the mystery and wonder of themselves that is revealed in dreams. Everyone should have it."
2,Approach with caution........,"I'll keep this short & sweet. I'm a MASSIVE Charles Glass fan. This is what spurred me to buy this DVD to begin with.BUT, honestly, I have to say this DVD set is AWFUL. I'm a trained, certified Fitness & strength coach professonal. I'm not allocating blame to any one thing or individual, but this material is terrible.Funny thing is, Charles IS a first class trainer BUT this footage is nothing like ""getting cut with glass"" or his appearances training pro athletes on other DVD titles.As the title says, approach with caution. I was EXTREMELY disappointed."
5,JAG - Second Season,"This is an exciting, ""clean cut"", program. This is certainly family entertainment. We like it because the characters are well developed and there is great heart to the stories as well as exciting drama. Another thing we like about these shows are they do not show the ""nitty, gritty"" detail of the characters that are killed. I do not enjoy the programs that show the bloody corpses. We have enjoyed this program so much we are eagerly waiting til they come out with the 3rd season.Phyllis Ann Rose"
5,"Bring It On, Harm and Mac Begin","Well as the DVD of Season 2 has not been released yet as I'm writing this review, I can't really say that it's going to be good. I admit that I stopped watching JAG at the end of the first season, but through a good friend of mine, I started watching season 2. The almost mystical relationship that develops between Harm and Mac is difficult to understand at first, but for those that watched the future episodes for the series, it laid it's ground rules in season 2. I think that all of us would agree that the chemistry between Harm and Mac is something that we all wish for, but we hope that it doesn't take 10 years to figure it all out. I have to say thank you to the makers of this DVD set. We the fans of JAG have waited a long time for these to become available to us, and I'm sure we all hope the the remaining seasons are soon to follow on DVD. I hope to one day say that I own the entire series of JAG for my own personal collection."
3,Fairly Decent,"I learned some things from this video- but, its geared more for the beginning guitarist than the advanced. Among other things, it was nice to learn about Joe's c-tuning and learn how to play ""Help Me Through The Night"". The first half of the tape is instructional, and the second performance. The performance section is kinda sloppy, but hey, its still Joe and that's part of his charm. A highlight for me was hearing a live version of ""Indian Summer"". Oh, and there's tons of the patented bizarre Joe Walsh brand of humor."
1,its not what your expecting !,"Save your money. There's nothing here you can use. Walsh and Clapton are my hero's, Now its only Clapton. Its a major let-down, I walked 3 times to get this from the mailbox yesterday, today I want to walk to the mailbox to send it back !"
5,The Best,"This book could also be titled, ""Everything You Always Wanted To Know About U.S. Coins."" Q. David Bowers is an absolute expert on the subject. You can't do better than this."
4,Simply - -- - -- --- Great,"This movie is Simply great , especialy if you like old movies you going to love it."
1,Discount Office Supplies,I ordered four of the above from Discount Office Supplies - 4 cases of paper at $3.70 each. The company sent 4 reams (thats alot less than the ordered 40 reams). I called to ask where the rest of the paper was and they told me that they would honor their price on amazon and ship out the remaining paper.Two weeks later they THEN called me and notified me that they were now 'out of stock' and that they had no idea if they would ever carry the paper again. I imagine that they didn't want to ship me the paper due to their pricing error - rather than honor the price (as they said they would) they just decided to 'sell-out' the rest of the paper... I plan on hounding them for as long as it takes until I get my paper.These folks are scammers. Don't buy from them. It isn't my fault that they bungled the selling price - it is THEIR fault that they are defrauding their customers.
3,Departure,"I agree, it sounds a lot different than the dying hairband days of the early 90's. I respect the effort in going toward a mature bluesy sound. I have it and will not give it up, its one of those sleepers. Give it a fair listen and I think you will enjoy it too."
1,"BORING, REALLY BORING","This album has nothing to do with the previus, stephen pearcy seems a living dead"
4,HP Laserjet Paper,HP paper works best in an HP printer (crisp & clean). Other paper tends to streak or overpring on your work and that just sucks.
2,Definitely not for beginners!!,"I just recently took up the violin and bought this thinking it would give me a jump start before I started lessons. I was wrong. First of all, the teacher on the accompanying instructional video has zero personality, something that I find very unmotivating. Also, there is not much in the way of demonstration. She will tell you, for instance, to play the G scale, then she will proceed to play through the entire scale without actually showing you what to do. There is no way anybody could learn to play on their own using this method. At the very best, this is a music book - that's all. My advice is to save your money and spend it instead on a real violin lesson."
4,God's easy rules for living well,"believe it or not, have several books on the same subject. this is the best of the lot. live by these principles, and life will be good."
2,Not great video quality,"Pretty good soundtrack, but the video is very poor and the AV sync is quite bad. Close your eyes as you watch this video and it won't be so bad."
1,Horrible soundtrack,"This has to be one of the worst SciFi movie soundtracks ever. I guess it fits with how bad the movie was. There's nothing here to get your blood pumping with anticipation of what's happening on the screen. There are some parts where the flutes, etc. are screeching at you like nails on a chalkboard. This music is better suited for another genre, like maybe Sesame Street."
5,Excellent soundtrack...,Another wonderful work by Morricone... Even after 400 soundtracks morricone can still touch my soul through his beautiful music.
2,Not as good as I expected,"the micrometeorites scene track and the Resupply Module scene track were pretty good, but I got pretty bored with the rest of it quite quickly. Compare this to, for example, the soundtrack CD to Star Trek the Best of Both Worlds, the latter had a lot more meat to it, and I ended up listening to that one much more. All in all, I probably would not recommend the Mission to Mars soundtrack CD."
4,Revlon RV444 Hot Air Styler and Dryer with Ceramic,Revlon RV444 Hot Air Styler and Dryer with CeramicQuite good styler and dryer! Only minus would be the brush heads which are very hard to change. Didn't work like it was said in the instructions. One little piece broke off in the process of changing a brush head....but gladly it still works and does miracles to my hair!
2,"Really glad it is as cheap as it is, because this product did not work very well for me","I love the other Revlon Air Brush, 1200 watt and pink, but mine broke after a year, and i was on vacation, so the only product they had at Walmart was the Revlon 444C. works okay for straightening my bangs, but it took a while to straighten my hair with it, and it still wasn't that smooth. i have naturally curly, coarse thick hair, but I loved my other Revlon Airbrush."
1,Don't BUY IT!!!!!!,"I just received my brush(es) hair dryer yesterday 3/9/07 ... tried it out today - for 5 MINUTES ... I absolutely hate it. It's the worst, by far, hair appliance I've ever owned. I guess you get what you pay for ... but I've owned Revlon products in the past, and this was absolutely the biggest waste of money. I cannot return it, because the return cost would be too expensive, too much trouble, and I guess it will go in the dumpster. I hate it - don't make the same mistake I made. One big problem is that the bristles are so lousy - not firm and doesn't grip the hair. Just take it from this written testimony - it's a piece of junk."
1,didn't last long enough :(,"This was a gift to replace an ancient, sadly-deceased Conair model. I wasn't crazy about it at first but managed to make the large barrel work for me. (The small barrel allowed too much air to blow everywhere.) My kinky/frizzy hair was smoother and straighter but still had body, unlike when using a straightening iron, so it was okay. After three months the large barrel base cracked so it wouldn't lock into the base. I used the small barrel, with much cursing, to semi-control my poodle hair. Two weeks later the unused-by-me ""rotate"" button fell off, allowing the barrel to spin freely.The device itself is a good styling tool, but 4 months is too short a lifespan, even at this reasonable price. I hope this was just a bum item and not a design flaw, but I'm still rating it a one."
1,Horrible!!!,"I have purchased the Revlon Hot air stylers for many years. This one though, I must say it's a piece of crap. Please do yourself a favor and do not buy."
2,Revlon Hot Air Brush,"The Revlon hot air brush (RV444) is the best styling tool I've ever used. Somehow, it managed to give my thin, dry hair, a body and sheen it's never had before. After it's demise - from extreme overuse, I presume - I tried to obtain the same model, but had to settle for the RV444C, which is apparently its newer replacement. They've added a large air vent between the barrel and the brush, which blows the hair every which way, so that it doesn't wrap about the brush properly and therefore doesn't create the desired curl. Being unable to locate the RV444, I finally had to go to Helen of Troy, which manufactures those Revlon products and purchased one for twice the cost of the 444C. It's worth it, though, to get those fantastic results!"
4,Alright. . .,"Well, it's not necessarily a bad product. I tried (and failed) to replace it with a much better stereo recently. The problem with this CD clock radio is that the only part that functions very well is the clock. The CD player skips constantly, the radio can pick up one out of every one hundred stations, and the maximum volume is extremely quiet. But the reasons I kept it over the stereo- the clock and the shut-off feature. The clock is perfect- no button to hit to make it glow at night. It's always bright and easy to read, so there's no need to be reaching around for buttons in the middle of the night. And this can be set to shut off after a certain period of time- probably it's best feature. When I listen to music at night, I want the player to shut off when the CD is over. This does that and does it well. I'm probably going to a buy a new clock radio to replace this one- but this one is definitely not a bad product. It's got some minor defects though that I wish I had been aware of."
1,Obsolete Technology with No Access,"Although this is described as Mac compatible, this application requires OS9 which is not well supported by Apple anymore. Trying it on Windows produced mediocre results. Don't waste your money on this! Even when running, it is not effective."
1,One of the worst albums I have herad in my LIFE,"I bought this CD, and after hearing it, I think I gave it to my dog to chew it a little bit since he had lost his bone. Afterwards, I swept the floor with it before throwing it in the garbage. Should I say more?"
4,"Electronic drums are a debit, songs are a plus","I strongly disagree that Gardner is a bad songwriter. I think the only problem is that the electronic drums are too trebly and distract from some interesting melodic changes. The middle section of ""Waterfront Weirdos"" is particularly good. Some songs aren't quite as strong (""Under the Wire"" is practically worthless) but most of them have powerful vocal harmonies and complex, intricate changes. And it is surprisingly catchy in places. If electronic drums drive you nuts, don't buy this, but if you can look past that, it's well worth the money."
1,Yuck!,"I wonder if I am listening to the same album that is reviewed below. Trent Gardner is obviously gripped by the worst kind of Yes-worshipping complex (circa 90125). I gravitated toward this band because they did such a good job on the Magna Carta tribute albums. They need a lot of work honing their songwriting skills. There is no doubt in my mind that the band is talented, but they are trying too hard to ape someone else without finding a vioce of their own. And on top of that, the lyrics are embarassingly puerile."
2,Forgot About It After 3 Days,"Dead in 3 Days is for the most part tedious and dull. I fell asleep about an hour and twenty minutes in. When I woke up the movie was over and I had to skip to where I was watching the movie when I fell asleep. A critic on [...] reviewed the DVD and said that it is the best slasher movie he's seen in a long time. I think it's one of the worst. It's a little better than Shrooms, but not by much. There's only one death scene that's even gory. Skip this and see a great slasher like Hatchet, Killer Movie, or Gutterballs."
5,Great Grammar learning tool! It worked for me!,"Not much can compare with Schoolhouse rock for education and this is an excellent grammar collection.Also check out the recent S c r i p t u r e R o c k for an updated take on Schoolhouse Rock, if you're into the Bible."
3,"Love the Container, Hate the filter","I bought this 7 gallon container to take on our camping trips and wanted the advantage of filtered water. The container is great and I love it....HOWEVER...the filter is a pain in the a** . It slows the water to a trickle. It takes 2 minutes to fill a 20 ounce glass of water and 5 minutes to fill the coffee pot. I ended up putting the container near the ground, so I could walk away and do other things. I recommend the container, but get it without the filter, it is a waste of money and time!!"
5,Great running CD,"I ordered this CD to motivate me when running. Songs are recognizable, and the tempo is great for exercising and running. This CD would also be great for party music. I ordered another Dance CD and all the songs had pretty much the same beat. The music on this is varied and the CD sound quality is great."
4,Good video of King David!,"This was a very good biography about King David, very interesting. Lots of info that I didn't know about him, well before seeing this video I just know King David as ""David and Goliath"" and that's it but he's much more then the small guy who killed Goliath he became a King!"
1,No Graphics,"This CD+G DOES NOT have any graphics (No on screen lyrics, etc) If you go to the manufacturer's website (Pocket Songs), it clearly states; ""*Does not contain graphics"". Why advertise it as CD+G if it does not have graphics. I intend to return this to Amazon immediately."
1,No Graphics,"I received this CD set today, and there are stickers over the ""CD+G"" circle on the case that say ""Non-Graphic."" Description is wrong. Mine is going back."
4,"Excelent Oil ""But""?","I've used this oil for cooking eggs and would have to say they where excellent. I also have added a little bit to my liquid lemon flavored fish oil and so far so good.BUT... now after reading a little more into it I'm starting to wonder if it is made to be used for cooking and or eating, since it says very little to that extent on the bottle. Everything on the bottle refers to hair and skin conditioner. There is like one line saying something to the extent that it is food grade. I've now stopped using it internally.Now I'll have to find another type to use since I don't think I need to wash my whole body with oil, I was looking for something to cook with and maybe use on salads for a change. I think for something food grade I would rather see a few more things about how to use it for food rather then a whole label describing the skin and conditioner usage.To bad since I really like Now Products, and have nothing bad to say about any of their past and present products."
3,This is for research,I have looked into the source of names in my work. I haven't fully read this book but what I have read I found to be enlightening.
1,Not Compatible,"Shipping was fast on this battery, but it didn't quite fit. The battery slid into place, but not quite far enough to snap in properly. I have a DCR-DVD405 which is supposed to be ok for this battery. The prongs do look like there is a slight inconsistency which may be preventing it from final fit. I will not be requesting a replacement. I will be getting a refund!"
4,David Weber: The Honor series,"I've read all of the honor books including this one, I just finished it last night and I have to say it's masterful. The action starts off slow of course and by about half way through the book I couldn't put it down. I've always liked David Weber's writing style, but this one is a must have. I would of course start from the first book On Basilisk Station, if you don't you'll be totally lost. Back to the review I would have to say if your a fan of Sci-Fi DO NOT skip this series."
4,"Fairly decent novel, worth the money",Nice led in for the next few novels. Honor and crew are behind emeny lines and against all reasonable odds they prevail. Fairly solid read. This novel is a good stand alone read.
2,a little disappointed,I didn't realize this was a coloring book when I ordered it. I was exepcting a colorful animal story for my kids. We will get use of it
4,If for no other reason...,"Let's be very clear: this CD will probably have a short half-life in your CD player. A lot of it is genuinely annoying, but like a pipewrench: when you need really annoying Beatles' covers -- and you know you will -- nothing else will do.The title of my review refers to the included Joe Pesci version of ""Got to Get You Into My Life"". This little postcard from an early moment of exploration and experimentation in Joe's life, sounds like a bland lounge singer through the verses, but when the chorus kicks in, Pesci's voice hits you like a bullet. If for no other reason, this is a keeper."
4,You Would Think Stars Are Smarter Than This.,"These are the worst versons of classic Beatles songs I have ever heard. Shatner's ""Lucy in the sky with diamonds"" is incredably bad. He sounds a lot more like he's on drugs than the Fab Four ever did. However, I give it a four because is soooo funny!"
2,Phat Trax 7 - Flat,"I was very disappointed by the sound quality of all the songs on the CD. My favorite song ""Heartbeat"" sounded old an uninviting. All the tracks are flat sounding. No dynamics. No bouquet of sound. The sound quality is less than MP3. I was completely surprised that it was compiled by Rhino Records. I have several collections from them and never had this problem. Unknown if this is a quality issue with the CD itself or if they used old worn out masters from a secondary source to create this CD compilation. The release date on the CD is 1997. Rhino probably needs to get digital remasters and create a new CD."
4,Bar im Ring,"Our 9th month daughter really ""gets"" this toy now and loves to use her fine motor skills to spin the bear in the ring. It is cute, well-made and will be a favorite for months to come."
1,Worst DVD ever released!,"God this thing is RETARDED!along with whats been said already here by other reviews, what really pisses me off is having watched this now we KNOW there is killer old footage of Santana that can be released in its fullness and NOT WITH A BUNCH OF TALKING OVER THE SONGS~!~!Black Magic women in a driving rain storm with fans going bonkers, that was killer. and the ONLY song on here worth watching.by far the most retarded release of any dvd ever. read the back of case, doesnt say anything like this was going to happen.been looking for years for old footage, here it is, and Carlos is talking over almost all the songs. did I say retarded yet?"
1,Dont Bother,Dont Bother ordering this light. The packaging is horrible.I recieved the first one and all the bulb housings were broken. I returned it and ordered it againThe second also arrived damaged. The packaging does not protect the contents and the cartons were barely even tapedshut.
4,Letters from My Sister,"Overall, this book had many laugh out loud moments and I enjoyed it very much. My biggest problem with the book was the weird turn it took in the middle with the stalking charge. It came out of nowhere and wasn't clearly explained. In many ways, that made the book much less enjoyable and a kinda disturbing. It's a good book overall, my problems notwithstanding, and I don't regret having spent my time reading it."
4,Nice,"This product is fine for its intended purposes. I took it to Africa for outdoor church conferences and from what i hear, it is not a let down. The only thing that we struggled with was the power adaptor from 120v to 240voltsThanks"
3,Lost souls,"'El invierno en Lisboa' is an interesting exercise into a group of characters, lost in their daily lives and connected by loose ties of friendship, love and hate. Written in 1988, at the age of 32, one can see some traces of the distinctive style that Muñoz Molina showed in the 90's."
2,"More of a Literary ""Cold Shower"" than Steamy Literature","The lastest collection of stories by authors Gelb and Garrett is a real mixed-bag of so-called erotic horror stories. The anthology begins with three or four stories detailing the deviant side of sexual horror. Hardly anything to get your pulse racing.These stories are followed by a short group of stories that, in my mind, could more aptly be called erotic horror as these stories dwell upon themes based on romantic relationships, rather than deviant behavior. From this point on, the stories fall into the just plain weird category.If you're a fan of the earlier books in the original series, I doubt that you'll find this collection to be a worthwhile addition to your library."
4,This one has lots of your favorites!,"Great collection with many of your favorite songs. Perfect for parties and dinners with friends - keeps them saying ""This is such a perfect CD - what was the name of it again?"". I pair this with Ultimate Divas and they work great by the pool or by the fire. Buy them both and enjoy!"
4,Enjoyable and helpful read,"Very helpful information on all book club matters - eg: how to make discussions deeper and richer with a section full of questions on style/character/themes etc, how to start/end discussions, best ways to discuss books, how to tackle various reading genres etc. I've read the book a couple of times and have gained new ideas to try both times times. I will be re reading it again in future. Highly recommended for anyone in a book club or wanting to start/join a club!"
1,Very Dissatisfied,"I am a smoker. Have been for many years yet I hate the smell in my house myself. I purchased this as I know Non-Smokers visiting cannot stand the smoke odor. Within 3 days, the horrible smoke smell was blowing out of the top of this machine (after supposedly filtering)! To work, at all effectly, I would have to change the filters every 2 days. Not at all practical or affordable. (and that`s assuming it would work). I am very disappointed - more wasted money!!!"
5,Great product - worth every penny,"I bought this for my 4 year old in July 2009. She was in and out of the dr. and the emergency room with chronic sinus infections and a persistant cough. After one day, she was not congested and her cough was barely there. It was also a bonus that the sound makes her sleep through the night with her baby sister crying in the room next door. The filters are a little pricey, but well worth the investment."
5,The humble opinion of a ex-Goth :-|,"Well, No matter what the last person said ... I think it's a great compilation ... Great songs, great music vids. Could have had more Sisters on it though.... But over all there is nothing wrong with the selection. If you are new to Gothic music.... I mean REAL Gothic Rock... not NuGoth, Scary-Trans, Darkmetal, Black Polka, Doom-yodelling or any of the other weak spin-offs of the `90's and 2000's... than this Little Black box of ""inner-morbid-heartaches and boo-hoo's"" is as great a place to start as any.5 skeletal thumbs up."
2,AFI..???,"Well, for most of the old schoolers reading these reviews, I tend to think most of us will have all if not most of these songs anyway. For the newbies, I would recommend it, god knows the newbies need some guidance on what is good Gothic music and what is not(coughing while muttering the name,AFI..AFI.) So is it worth the 50 or 60 dollars? Depends, If you out there have Limewire or another way of downloading some of these artists first, then try that before you buy this. If not look for it cheaper. It has a good lineup, but, like I said before..the old schoolers need not apply...and just because some band does a remake of the Cure song, ""The Hanging Garden""..does not mean they deserve to be on a Gothic comp!!(AFI)...It is nice to see Charlotte Sometimes on a comp. My fav Cure song!"
1,Nice sheets until they started to wear through,"I bought these sheets on May 22, 2007 and the fitted sheet is totally trashed on Sept 25, 2007. Wore through in several spots, and now are in tatters."
2,Looked good but didn't last,The sheets are generous in depth so will fit a thick mattress. They are also very silky feeling. At first I loved these sheets and then one I felt a tear and looked to see the bottom sheet in tatters...totally trashed and no longer usable....this was after six months of use!...since I like my sheet matching I had to shop for another set. I will not be purchasing these again.
1,Fell apart after a few washes,Agree with other reviewers... the fitted sheet fell apart after a couple of washes. Don't purchase this item at full price - $10 is the most I'd suggest you pay since you will only be able to use the set for a few months!
4,"nice quality, great gift","this gift went over like gangbusters! decent quality, nice rich colors. i'm not sure about the reactive quality, but my cousin seemed to like it."
4,Great fun,"You have to like B westerns and similar silliness to like this film. Tropical settings, sailing vessels, lusty songs, bad people, not so bad people, good people, are all part of the fun. It is Indiana Jones done in the 30s and without a college degree."
4,"""A very interesting and moving book""",This book was the best I ever read in my life. After reading several other books I think that this was the best. It shows how a boy survives through a blizzard and looses some of his vital limbs. In the end he is a very sucssesful person!
2,The I'm Bored on Sunday Book,Matthew Unstrung was not very interesting to me. It did'nt really keep my attention however I do think that this book is a good reference to learn about Christian America in the early 1900's.
1,Don't be shocked by the one star,"Entertaining? yes... Fun? yes... Satisfying? no....(the one star is because of this)I don't understand how a nice series like this is not being released like all the successful TV series i.e. boxed sets. The only answer i can think of is that they do not consider it as a successful one. I'm a big fan of TV series like Friends, Stargate,...etc so i would really like to add another series to my collection."
1,Why the hell is there no Complete Season release yet?,"It's unusually pathetic that FOX hasn't put this show out on DVD yet in its complete form in the US. This was a huge show during its time, and it's a total joke when you look at some of the shows being released in full seasons onto DVD these days..."
4,Wish there had been more,"I've never seen Ally McBeal before this weekend. I rented the DVD version and saw 6 episodes and I liked them. I thought Ally can be a little flaky at times but I really enjoyed the shows.I wish there had been more. I immediatly was hoping for the next set to be available as it doesn't state it is the first season, it just states that it is the first set; but there was nothing else in the aisle for the show.I'm dissapointed there aren't more yet! Please, please put out more soon!"
2,What an insult!!,"While I might be inclined to believe that the seris was a cult fav, it still was extremely popular. This DVD release is an insult to all the faithful followers and just a tease to those who are unfamiliar with the ironic yet hilarious humor. There is a bit of Ally in all of us. Does Fox even know how frustrating it is to know that Ally is available in just about every country but the U.S.? I had to buy season one off a jerk on ebay and it was burnt and it sucked! I did get season four from a fabulous person in another country. Expensive song rights or not, give your loyal fans what they deserve and make it good with deleted scenes and lots of special features!!!!"
1,Write to 20th Century Fox Home Video,"I've been watching the Ally McBeal reruns on FX network and, since so many television series are out on DVD, tried a search. What a disappointment to see that the only thing available in the US is this abbreviated set, but the entire run of the series is out in Britain and Europe!I emailed FOX and was told to write to the following address (no email address indicated):20th Century Fox Home VideosP.O. Box 900Beverly Hills, CA 90213-0900I've written and sent copies of the reviews posted on Amazon.com. Maybe we can get this released here if enough of us write! Join me!"
2,not what I expected,I'm torn I just didn't like parts of this book. Those parts just made me just not really ever get a feel for this book. I had read so many great things about this book and while it was a neat way to present the Christmas story in chapter form I just wasn't pleased with how Mary was presented and not really sure I'd want to read this to my girls or have them read it.thank you Zondervan for sending me the book for review I wish I liked it but it just wasn't what I expected.
2,"Havens Shines, But Most of the Rest is Forgettable","I've never seen the movie WARRIORS OF VIRTUE. As a novelty, I would someday like to see it. However, I have listened to the WARRIORS OF VIRTUE SOUNDTRACK numerous times. I received a copy of it years ago when I was producing an international award-winning children's radio show. We received a couple of copies. We gave one away and kept one to play music from the show. Unfortunately, the music really didn't fit with the show and was rarely played. I ended up keeping the cd because I couldn't find anyone who wanted a copy of this used cd.The music on the album is a strange conglomeration. There's some instrumental songs; a moving, semi-spiritual piece; some alternative-sounding tracks; and at least one rock song. Of the thirteen tracks on the album the only two I can really recommend are ""Inside of You"" by Richie Havens and ""Song of the Seas"" by Vangelis. For me, the rest of the tunes are forgettable."
3,spritzer on ice in NYC,"This is the first live Pavement album I've purchased that wasn't a blank cd with fancy artwork. Coincidentally, it's also the first one I bought somewhere besides on a sidewalk in Krasnoyarsk. I enjoyed the cover of 'Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm' by The Crash Test Dummies, but the background vocals where distracting (sorry Bob!). Their cover of 'Bucephalus Bouncing Ball' by Aphex Twin failed on practically every level, but I did have to respect how they segued into it from 'Carrot Rope'. Was it brave or irritating of them to continue on with the song 'Spit On A Stranger' after Malkmus broke 4 strings on his Gibson? Well. . . you decide. If I hadn't paid $125 for this, then I might be less critical, but I suppose the photos in the booklet helped justify the cost a bit. I still can't tell after hours of studying pages 4 and 5 if that is blood on that ""hooker"" or if they altered the photo in photoshop. Either way, it's a tie between hilarious and traumatizing."
3,doodle pads,These pads are fine for sketching out plans for yourself but not for formal projects. Because they are 4 squares per inch on one side and 5 squares per inch on the other you can see the other set of lines through the pages which can be a little distracting. I actually like having this option though when I'm drawing something larger to scale. Good for the price.
2,No new information,"I have read many books on the subject of the end times and they all basically say the same thing. When you get down to it no one really knows what will happen in detail in the coming years. They could all have it wrong for that matter. This book is no different in that respect. The thing that bugged me the most about it was the endless repetition of themes and quoted scriptures. I understood what he was saying the first time. To top it off it seems all of these type books plead with the reader to accept salvation, not a bad thing in itself, its just the way they go about it, like an afterthought. There are better books out there on this topic."
4,Excellent Light,"In my opinion, and I have tried them all, this is the best light sold for the GBA. They are really hard to find though, especially in a matching color, but if you can get your hands on one, go for it. A great light!"
4,Something really good going on,"This one is one of the best examples of how musically coordinated a band can be. Technically, it is quite impressive, with good use of odd metrics and impossible playing. Donati once again features his wise use of polyrythms and an awesome double bass drum technique. Macalpine soloing remains very melodic, and his rhythm playing has a great mechanical feel. As for Sherinian, his playing becomes more impressive with each release.Compared with the previous efforts, this one really raises the bar. It's jazzier for sure, but still remaining heavy enough to be called prog metal (just to put a label)It's pompous, complex and tasteful. Highly recommendable"
3,Great Performance-Defective DVD,"I have been looking forward for this DVD. I had the VHS for years, so the performance is a delight to me. But I was disappointed as I received a defective DVD. I returned it and the replacement had the same defect. It would not play after the first act. Amazon has been very decent about it but I am disappointment as I had to ask for a refund. Has anyone else had this problem? I am going to wait a while and then try again.Verdi: Ernani (1983)"
1,Sorry to disagree,"I wonder if those who are enthusiastic about this performance have seen the Muti/La Scala performance with Domingo, Freni, Bruson, and Ghiarov? That one is fiery and exciting. I found this production plodding. Of course, Pavarotti sings well, but Leona Mitchell does not have the flexibility in her voice to sing the role well. I recommend waiting for the La Scala production - with all 4 singers and Muti in superb form, though the sets are sometimes ludicrous."
1,Faulty production run,"I know this performance is worthwhile. However, I tried two copies and neither would play past Act I. This is a Decca product? Times have certainly changed."
4,Interesting relaxing progressive metal,"This is the first cd I bought of Enchant,the first thing I can say is that this is quite a relax-like progressive metal,its like a smooth Dream Theater,or at least this album has that feel to it. The vocals eventhough being very tuned lack pressence and maybe that's the only bad thing I can find here,because these are good musicians and make proof of it by great song writting.an interesting detail found here is that the songs have a perfect poem like structure,all the lines rime very well,and are very descriptive and well thought. this cd doesn't have any fast-powerfull songs,all the songs here are smooth. if you're looking for an interesting progressive rock band but want to try something more calm this is ideal."
2,Iron Maiden Clone,"What can I say; I didn't even buy the CD. The available samples sound like a poorly engineered Iron Maiden/Dream Theater clone. I will grant that the musicians, individually, are quite good with their instruments, but the whole does not seem to be greater than the sum of its parts. It didn't surprise me."
5,Terrific show - wish it were on DVD,"Bob Cringely, an airplane enthusiast, sets out to prove you can build a plane in your garage in a month. It is fun to watch him build the plane, to try new things some of which work some of which fail. But mostly it is a *superb* portrayal of project management. He starts off very optimistically, making jokes and happy, then gets more serious as the time passes and he is clearly behind, then positively grim as it is clear he can't do it...a couple weeks in the people paying him insist on a schedule, which he resists...Anyone who has ever worked on a large project at work should watch this. Anyone who has ever sat in a meeting and their boss says, ""We can have the annual report in two weeks"" when you *know* it is really going to be six weeks should watch this. The guys was funny, the story was interesting, and the story within the story - the project management - was great."
1,An old game for new technology,"I remember when the game first came out, 1983 and even back then it was frustrating to play. I like the interactively now available through DVD. Unfortunately this game, although based on interactivity, doesn't offer it as it is intended. This game could have been re-mastered or even revamped to suit today's technology. Its so frustrating to see the same video screened repeatedly. No skill needed - a basic game that requires very basic skill, 'pushing the right button at the right time'. Good for 'old time', 'reminisce' value - but it ends there."
1,as bad as the movie!!,"elliot goldental is terrible as a composer,he does not give us excitment like the terrific DANNY ELFMAN!!!!!!,poor,poor,poor."
2,Linkin Park downgraded..,"I only give it the 2nd star because, being Linkin Park material, they are atleast somewhat listenable. I went through several of the song samples provided and i gotta say. It sounds alot like something my band plays when we practice. Which is to say it isnt that good. So when you buy the album, dont expect good production values or professionally recorded music, w/ professional acts. They're just amateurs and 2nd rate bands. Probably just fans like you and I. At most, it is amusing."
1,Unworthy,"I can understand why someone would do a tribute to Linkin Park. They are an amazing band that are redefining an entire genre. They had nothing to do with this CD. That too, I can understand. If you want a good set of Hybrid Theory's remixes, for God's sake buy Reanimation. I'm an extreme Linkin Park fan, and I wouldn't spend a dollar on this disc."
1,total fake..,... u see nowhere in it anything with authentic linkin park logos or copyrighs and such anywhere on it.....
4,Bettter than most,"I do HVAC work. I do a lot of sheet metal work and custom ducting, mostly in attics. I find these to work pretty good. I've used a lot a different snips in my quest to find the perfect one. These come close, but my quest isn't over."
1,Garbage,"I ordered 2 of these adapters -- one for each end of a cable -- and found that one didn't work at all and the other worked intermittently depending on how it was positioned. On the adapter that didn't work at all, the swiveling portion was pulled out a bit from the body. AVOID THIS PRODUCT!!"
4,Some clips duplicated,"This is another great video, but we have an Elmo video titled ""Things That Make Elmo Happy"" or something like that, and the dancing or music is duplicated in that, which was kind of disappointing, but the video is still great."
1,Very disappointed,"Seems like a good product but it is not. Wired up and everything works. Next time you use it, it may not. After I started having problems with it I read the ratings from others and found that my experience is not unusual. I spent hours trying to trace an electrical problem and it was the panel."
1,The worst theater CD I've ever bought!,"No originality, both in compositions and singing style; poor quality singing (very nasal voices); poor quality recording.My copy went straight to the used CD store. What a waste of time listening to this overrated album!"
1,Just no,"If you like the story, go see Verdi's beautiful opera Aida.Leave this mess of mundane pop ballads and sentimental nonsense behind. That's all I have to say."
3,Great songs but voices are so-so,"I had the pleasure of seeing Aida twice now on Broadway with the late 2003/early 2004 cast, which were mostly the same both times and with Michelle Williams taking the lead as Aida. I bought the CD after seeing it the first time and although the music is quite good, having been spoiled by the great voices of this current Broadway cast, hearing the voices on the CD just don't do it for me. Seeing the show the second time confirmed it for me... the original cast's voices aren't even half as good as what I heard from the cast on Broadway now.It's so disappointing in comparison in fact that I can't even enjoy listening to it on CD. It just makes me think about how much better I've heard the same songs from the current cast. I really hope they decide to make a new version of this album with the new cast!"
2,Poor Show Not Quite Saved By Good Voices,"The book and music for this show are truly disappointing. I saw Aida after having seen Heather Headley in Lion King and being beyond impressed with her talent. I can honestly say that I have never been so let down by a show. The music has some nice tunes but is very superficial and silly for the most part.The women in the show are wonderful. Ms. Headley and Ms. Scott have perfect voices for the roles and their acting is superb. Mr. Pascal, on the other hand has a very ""rock"" voice which, in my opinion, should stay in the world of rock. Although his acting is solid, he screams and screeches his way through the score. I am not really sure how this man still has a voice after all the sreaming he has done on Broadway.The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because of Headley and Scott's exceptional voices. If you want Elton John, get the Lion King instead."
4,this is great!!,"I love Adam Pascal in RENT so i bought this and was happily surprised! It's full of rock, pop, reggae and ballads. My favorite songs were: ""Every Story is a love Story"" ""Fortune Favors the Brave"" ""Another Pyramid"" ""How i know you"" ""Like father like son"" and ""My strongest suit."" You will be happily surprised as well. I can't wait to actually see AIDA!"
5,Randy at his Best!!!!!,"The songs, music and quality of R.T.'s voice are at its best!!! I'm glad I purchased this cd."
5,A Superlative 10-Star Read!,"There is a point in PLOT TWIST that will have you throwing the book down in amazement at how completely you've been taken in. But this book amounts to more than a couple of very stunning plot twists. It is an superbly plotted, often wildly funny and ultimately poignant book that is five stars above the ordinary mystery. Once again, Jane Rubino takes her southern New Jersey setting and her wonderful characters and sets them in motion in a page-turner that allows Rubino to take aim at targets like entertainment unions, talk show hosts, celebrities, and moviemaking, while provoking the reader to examine some interesting themes involving reality versus illusion. This is the most involving and entertaining book I have read in a long time. Rubino gets very high marks for the way in which she has developed one of the best casts and series around."
2,Against The Flow,"I found this book to be one of the slowest and most tedious novels that I have read, in a long while. To put that in context, I read 200+ novels per year.The murder doesn't happen until page 179 and I found that the use of scenes disrupted the flow of the novel so that it felt disjointed, and never managed to achieve any flow... I had to force my way through it.Contrast this story against any of Ann Perry's, for example, and my perspective is that this author is just not in the same league."
4,Good Purchase,Ordered this replacement battery for my Sony Cybershot T1. Received this within three days via USPS. The battery works as well as the OEM battery and am satisfied with the purchase. No need to pay higher price for the OEM battery as this will work just fine.
3,Wrist Strap Too Small,"There isn't much to an anti-static wrist strap as they are all more or less the same. The issue I had with this particular product is that if you have a medium/large wrist, the strap barely fits, so it's somewhat of a challenge strapping the device to your wrist. It would have been amazing if they made the Velcro strap a few inches longer so that it would be easier for people with larger wrists to use."
1,less than expected,"This radio was over-hyped,it does not live up to what is claimed,there were quite a few AM stations that I was not able to receive even with the addition of the TERK antenna which was suppose to improve reception. I was able to receive more AM stations with my $59.00 Sony walkman radio."
1,Hate to beat a dead horse but have to,"I was foolish and bought two of these a long time ago, one silver and one black. They failed and Crane repaired both, for 40 dollars if I remember correctly. Failed again and they still sit in dishonor on a shelf in my shop. So, three hundred dollars thrown away and not enough interest to call Crane again. But hearing a current Crane ad on KGO and knowing they are sitting there broken for years and taking up space, nagged and nagged me to warn others about Crane products. It should feel better though -- it feels like I lost an old friend."
1,Thanx for the honest reviews...you saved me some money,"Been researching the CC radios for some time...and personally I'm not going to do a purchase. Far too many negative review, not only this site but others. My plan was to purchase two CC's ...not now or ever.Again, thanks to all the people who didn't hold back."
1,Don't waste your money - Don't Buy this radio!,What a disappointment this radio was after all the good things you read about it. To pay over $160.00 for a radio to find out it works no better then any old AM/FM Radio is so disappointing!Don't buy it!
2,"Terrible quality,and Lackluster reception","Not what I expected,maybe I was unlucky.Radio played like the weather,very unpredictable including the quality of the radio.This might be an isolated case."
4,Very nice radio for news and talks,"In search for a portable radio I really like, I acquired Model 1, S350, Superadio 3, and CcRadio in the last two years. Here is how they are being used after this time:Model 1 -- used for FM classicals, unplug power cord when not in use. It makes a humming noice after a few days stay plugged in, don't know why.S350 -- used for FM public radio, very nice and warm sound on FM, kinda muffled on AM stations.CcCrane -- used for AM listening, very nice and clear voice, the weather channel is also nice feature, sound constrained on FM stations.Superadio 3 -- no longer in use, still on the initial sets of battery after two years, sound is paper-ish comparing to others."
5,The essentials,"It truly is ""the best' of this wonderful group. I recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed their music or is interested in learning more about them."
4,A gem of a book.,"This concise commentary on the Gospel and epistles of John, at less than 130 pages, packs in an immense amount of Father Brown's unparalleled scholarship while retaining his typically fresh and readable style. If Fr. Brown's work is the perfect way for Christians to delve deep into Catholic and Orthodox biblical studies, this book is the perfect introduction to his work. If you've read one of his massive tomes (which themselves are highly recommended, but be prepared for an intellectual commitment), this one may seem a bit thin, but even so it will be worthwhile."
2,"Great music, poor DVD","Musics are great!Even better than ""Live at the Hollywood Palladium"".But this DVD's quality is very poor!It has wrong aspect ratio, actually this film is 4:3(Standard)but DVD player recognize as 16:9(Anamorphic).So you'll watch the film stretch asaide, it's very strange.I'm sorry my english is not so good, but I have to tell this to you All."
1,Very little content. Spend your money elsewhere.,"I have read many books on trading and was very disappointed with this book. I have never seen a 250 page book have so little content. The page layout uses large margins, large fonts and lots of spacing. It reminds me of 9th grade English when you had to write a 5 page term paper - instead of filling it with content, you tried to trick the teacher by double spacing! The content that was supplied did not go into near enough detail for a trader to build a system without referring to other books. Spend your $44.00 elsewhere."
4,metal gear solid3 snake eater,maps are a bit confusing. Picture illistration are small and not very clear. the control pictures in the illistations are also hard to see.
4,It summarizes lot of good technical informations,"Even though it didn't cover enough info for CCNA, it explains extremely well. Easy understanding. A book you must keep."
2,Great Book BUT FULL OF ERRORS,"I enjoyed reading this book. It is very well written and easy to understand, BUT there are many syntax errors in the examples (incorrect Cisco IOS command). Buy it for the explainations, but get yourself another book for configuration commands."
1,Rip-off,"I am a long-time Johnny Winter fan and own most of his releases.This was a total waste of money. It is absolutely the most poorly recorded CD I own. What you can hear of Johnny is great asalways, but the sound quality is incredibly bad. Buy this only if you want a prime example of how a CD should NOT sound."
2,How an Ivy League Math Geek Learned to Write a Bad Book,"I've read easily a dozen poker books - normal stuff like, Jones, Sklansky, Harrington, Gordon, and I thought this book would talk about Matt'a learning experience, what levels he started at and where and what he learned. This book started out like a read for a complete beginner with talk of how to play Hold 'Em. It continued with a self-inflated view of his trournament history - include hand by hand in certain tournaments. It includes stuff like ""then with the blinds at 500-1000, I picked up ATo and raised on the button to take the blinds."" Jesus - who cares? The amazing part is that this book was written BEFORE he won playing in the 2004 WPT Championship. He was nothing but an amateur with a couple cashes. He had no business writing a book. And sinec this book was written in 2003, some stuff has a bit out of date. I wish I had not bought the book at all."
1,Worked for only minutes,"I plugged a 1750 W appliance into this and the fuse blew in just a couple of minutes, or something else happened. Anyway this is a 2000W converter and should have lasted a little longer. I've been using a much smaller converter from Samsonite and that one is working just fine."
4,6.5 diesel fuel filter,Genuine delco part for less money than most places you cant go wrong the seal stays in place unlike some jobber ones
3,Not what i expected,this book says A to Z but is really not. im missing a to on things but its a good starter
1,Worst unit I ever owned - DO NOT BUY,"After 12 months of problems with this all-in-one fax machine, i've given up on trying to get it to work. So many calls with customer service with excuses of transmission problems or the reciever's line isn't working properly that my only recoarse was to use the unit as a phone or printer. DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT!!"
4,Vibrant Color for Your Brother MFC Unit,"The ""Brother LC02BK Ink Jet Cartridge (Black)"" is one of the necessary accessories you'll need if you purchased one of Brother's 7100 series MFC's. Rich in color, the ink cartridge gives you a good buy for your money. If you a person who doesn't use your MFC on a daily basis, then the cartridge will last you for a long time. However, if you're a person who constantly uses, then the cartridge;s supply won't last too long. That is the only negative thing about this product.Besides one minor fault, Brother's MFC/Fax accessories are one of the market's best buys in quality and performance. I recommend purchasing a few of these cartridges whenever your purchase them online so that you can have some on reserve just in case your cartridge runs out of ink."
1,Oh dear God...,"Let me just say that the song smile has the stupidest lyrics I have ever heard. Save your money and do not buy this single. I can write better lyrics the this (gulp) future teen idol. Heck, I can SING better than this teeny crap. She will be popular for about 2 seconds and the WHAM! no one will care anymore. Save your money and go buy good CD's, like Smash Mouth, Everclear, and Limp Bizkit."
4,Pretty Good!,"I thought that Smile was a pretty good song. Now it isn't better then some other stuff I have heard like 808, or Bills Bills Bills. But it is pretty good!"
3,good song kinda i guess,"it's a good song, sorta kinda maybe i guess so. i think that she wears WAY WAY WAY too much makeup. it's a good song, sorta kinda maybe i guess so. depends on your point of view"
2,Disappointing,Don't spen big import bucks to get this album. With the exception of producer David Hentchel I never heard of any of the bands on this album. The one song that stands out is the opening track Watcher of the Skies. A spectacular version. Many too Many and Undertow are also listenable.
3,not detailed enough,"sure, they have stuff on all the cars and tracks, but absolutely NOTHING on the Arcade Mode. They mention that it is there, but that's it. I liked the poster though."
5,Excellent book for ages 10 and OVER,"I have read these books since I was 9 and I'm 12 now. They are very good and well written, always exciting and interesting. I would not reccomend these for people under 9 or 10 because you may find it too complicated like I did. Unlike boring Thoroughbred books that drag out or unrealistic, poorly written heartland books, these move quickly and are very realistic. This one was especially funny and intruiguing. Read it!"
1,crash the party,this album is to commercial each song is saying the same thing which makes this whole album one dimensional both artists are saying the same thing over and over again on every song none are breaking away from the mainstream you can tell these cats are young this album is wack the lyrics are weak and the beats are below average this album is wack to the 9th degree on a scale from one to ten i give it an absolute zero this album is a disgrace to rap music you never get a second chance to make a first impression!
3,its ayight,"ayight chekk it, this cd iz ayight. but the song now that your gone boosted em frum a 2 to a 3. tell me is ayight to but they cant be talkin bout chillin in da hood if they frum orlando cuz errybody no there aint no hood in orlando. now that your gone is sad as hell but tight az hell to. but dont waste your time on this juss get ya ur homeboy orhomegirl to burn you a cd an put now that your gone an tell me on it cuz those are the only songs worth listenin to.peace"
2,Smilez and Southstar....are these guys cholos or something?,"Listen to these dudes names (LOL)! Can somebody tell me where in the blue hell these guys came from? This album was pretty wack, and their hit-single, ""Who Wants This?"" isn't very impressive either. The production was sub-par and the quality of their lyrical flow-tations isn't very good either. These guys constantly rhyme throughout their record 'Crash the Party' about how good they can flow, yet, ANYBODY can rhyme when they write it down on a piece of paper. I'd LOVE to see these guys try and spit poetry on an open mic and really see how much fire they got in their artillery. Until then, I can think nothing more of them other than them being just another pointless duo who can do nothing spectacular for hip-hop. As far as the album goes, the only joint I can recommend is ""Lets Get Naked,"" but even that cut is barely decent. Expect Smilez and Southstar to disappear from the scene very soon."
5,stunning music I've never tired of hearing!!!!,"This is perhaps the most grandiose and elegant, yet dark and unsettling music I've ever heard. Without even seeing the movie people can easily grow to love this! To me, almost Lovecraftian in atmosphere, you can listen to this entire score of music and still keep the mood with you long after you're turned off your player!"
4,A Gem Indeed,"When you think of gems, what do you think of? I think of small and pricey. And, that is about right for this book. The content is good: a single black and white picture per tank, its specifications and a short history. The tanks are divided by nation and listed somewhat chronologically. There is quite a bit of information packed into this little book.On the down side, the book lacks an index, and covers only one model of each tank (for example the German Pzkw IV shows the specifications for only the H model). In most respects this is a very nice little reference, but you will need something bigger for a complete reference.P-)"
1,a real music fan,vitamin c is another computer altered teen throb that doesn't write her own songs or has any musical talent.
1,No wonder it's no longer available.,"This product was not compatible with my Tungsten T3, which it's supposed to be used on. It made my SD card freeze up, even though I bought a Palm SD card to insure compatibility. Once the SD card is frozen, you can't do anything with the TomTom software, and the Palm support people won't help because they say the problem is caused by the TomTom software. This product is not currently available on Amazon, which may be because it just doesn't work as represented."
1,Avoid this product,I also just received this product and it was missing parts for the mounting cradle and the attachment cables. Also it appeared to be a previously opened item as there were loose packing materials in the box and the manual was scuffed and dirty. There appears to be a problem with Amazon or this supplier. Either way I would avoid them both as there are many other reliable etailers on the web.
4,"If anything, a lot of fun.","I am one of those Rush purist guys. That said, this is probably the best a Rush tribute will ever get. Yes, the songs aren't performed quite to the level of the originals, but duplication really wasn't the point of the album (if you want the originals, buy the original albums). To me, the point is obvious: this is a bunch of huge Rush fans who wanted to have a lot of fun playing Rush tunes, and it shows. If anything, Steve Morse's playing on La Villa Strangiato is worth the $15 on its own. Well done all around."
5,Larson's New Book of Cults,"EXCELLENT! Bob Larson is the top authority in cultic activity today both in the world and in the body of Christ. Living in Flagstaff, AZ we have ALL the cults mentioned, in the book, active and recruiting new mwmbers here in the area. Many in the body of Christ do not want to admit that cults are active in thier towns, homes and even their churches but they are and are growing at an alarming rate. This book is a NECESSITY for every believer to have to know who and what is knocking at their door. As a pastor I highly recommend it for every church's and bleiever's library."
2,A Highly Biased Viewpoint,"I read this book some time ago. I found some of the information within it to be quite good, but on whole was not impressed by the highly biased and negative way the author chose to represent those faiths he didn't personally believe in. The book is more of an editorial on non-Christian religion than a research source."
5,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!!","This has to be the most original take on Earnhardt I've seen. Most of the other books are light-weight, long-winded remembrances from sportswriters. This book presents Earnhardt's career from beginning to end, season by season and track-by-track. Literally all of the stats are here. I knew a lot about Dale, but never knew he achieved so much - especially early in his career. I didn't realize he won the seventh race of his rookie season. Then he won his first championship in 1980 in just his second season, beating out the legends (Yarborough, Petty, Allison and Waltrip). I knew Dale was great but this book does more to illustrate his greatness than any other book I've read (and I've read them all). If you are a NASCAR fan or a Dale fan, you will enjoy this book."
2,Brain Functioning,"""Inside the Brain"" was easy to read, informative and relatively practical. However, a new edition may be in order as the state of information in the field of Neuroscience has expanded significantly in the last ten years."
3,Very readable. Very interesting.,"It's not the kind of book one would normally take on vacation for beach and dock reading but I did and as a teacher of 3 to 6 year olds and a mother I was gratified to see that what has been felt for years is finally being proven. We, as teachers watch and see alot and it is the environment of the child's life that ultimately makes the difference and now the proof is in. I also recommend it for anyone who has suffered from depression or alcoholism, the explanations are clear and make sense."
5,"A Must for parents, educators, doctors, and politicians","This easy to read, informative book gives a clear picture of how stimuli connects and wires our brains from conception on. How bad stress, substance abuse, and physical abuse can lead to white matter damage. The research and references are outstanding. This book should be mandatory for all educators and parents. Dr. James A McGregor and Suzi McGregor"
5,Just what I wanted.,"I was wary about buying these Reporter's Notebooks without knowing the quality, but I am happy with them. They are just what I needed. I hope to buy more in the future; otherwise I have to drive 35 miles to the closest office supply store to get the kind I have been using for years."
3,?over my head?,"I find myself listening over and over to understand the point. It gets lost in the rather intellegent wording. It is me though, not the author. Just beware that your mind may wander. I love the fact that it has summarys at the end of each mystery on theology and discussion. If I could focus, I would have given it 4 stars, I rarely give 5 stars to any product, as nothing is perfect unless it is Heaven itself."
1,Junk,"Junk, broke in one week, looking to returnI installed it, the valve leaks like a sive. What a waste of time and money"
3,Monster Truck book.,bought this book for my 3.5yr old son. He is a huge fan of Monster trucks. Liked the book. It had lots of great information and pictures. I was disappointed there was little information about Monster Jam. The index was pretty bad. I couldn't find references to people indicated in the index. I was disappointed when the cover came off about a week after we got it.
5,"Way to eat, guys!","Let's hear it for the men who made it cool to be overweight! Well, not really, but let's face it: there's only so much a couple of dudes can do in that department. Nope, for the most part they focused on rappin', which is respectable and all, as this greatest hits collection well conveys. Unfortunately, when you call yourself such a name, your appearance will always stand at the fore of your image as an artist. And ladies and gentlemen, that's no way to conduct a career, let alone to establish positive, durable mental health. I mean, look at that one poor Fat Boy - he died! (I think.) On the serious tip though, it's folks like these who bring in the fun and usher out the ""bling-bling"" ""playa"" ""whassup"" and ""I'm chillin'"" aesthetic from rap, at least while you're listening to them. The rest of the time it's still there though. Does that sadden me? Little bit."
5,"Great Deal, Great Ride","I admit it, I sort-of dreaded sitting down and reading a novel on my computer screen. Please don't let this keep you from reading this book. It's as fine as anything I've read in the past several years. The author, who is a very fine reviewer in her own right, really shows that she can spin a captivating, energetic, and above all fun story herself. There are elements of science fiction, mystery, horror, thriller, and comedy all intermixed in this thoroughly entertaining ride. The unexpected twists are worth the price of admission alone. The book itself would make a great movie, and it's got to be one of the greatest bargains available. If you have the slightest interest in science fiction or mystery, you owe it to yourself to grab this book while you still can.I only have one question, Lisa, when is the sequel coming?"
3,TOPPS 2 HOLE YELLOW PAD,"This type of pad is difficult to locate because it seems that no one makes them anymore, punched. I liked the perforations-they come off easily, but the too flexible cardboard on the back takes away from the functionality for me."
3,pageant costume,Good price n fast shipping. Skirt runs a little big n belt was flimsy n really big. Top was true to size. Boot cover didn't stay on right. Better off wearing a regular pair of red boots. Overall descent costume n would recommend to someone
1,"Holy disorganization, Batman....","It's been a few months since I read this, but I thought I might give a review.I found this book horrid. It was not organized in a way that would be simple and easy for a reader. As a writer of historical fiction I was interested in finding out about daily life during the Civil War. But I would find references from all years thrown together so I had to fish out the important details.It was not broken down by years or decades which I think would have been much easier. I gave up on this book because I couldn't find the information I needed.If you are a writer and are thinking about this book I suggest getting it from the library, and if you believe it will be of use to you buy it then."
2,"Like a very good lie, there is enough truth to fool you.","It has been several years since I read this, but there are many small problems in this book. Most people will not know the difference, but I will not recommend it to anyone who wants to portray accuracy."
1,Ergotron 200 Series Data Entry Arms,"I must say I am SERIOUSLY disappointed in these arms. We have approx 30 of these arms on our manufacturing floor, and probably 75% of them have become almost unuseable due to 'blown out' elbow joints. They are all less than 5 years old (under warantee) but Ergotron says that its our fault for puting too much weight on them and they won't warantee them. (monitor+keyboard+mouse=too much weight???) They were nice enough to offer to sell replacement parts at FULL price...but they are currently out of stock (maybe we're not the only ones with issues??). If you are just mounting a monitor on the wall and are never going to move it, this projuct is probably fine. Otherwise, steer clear. I've found other better products for over 100 bucks cheaper from different manufacturers."
1,gender neutral translations are not new...,"any hype re: gender neutral or ""unbiased"" translations is ridiculous. They are no new news! the RSV and the NRSV have been out for 20-30 years; each translation is gender neutral and very literal in its approach to the text. Anyone who tries to find an agenda behind having an accurate translation of Hebrew and Greek has an agenda themself -- to keep the Bible as representative of a form of Christianity where men have a special place and the language of maleness is undeniably present in places where this is simply untrue. Anyone who has a decent Hebrew or Greek lexicon can discover for themselves that pronouns used in the original text are often neutral and have been translated in the KJV or NIV according to trends in English usage, not original manuscripts."
1,I Ignored the warnings,"Slick looking portable radio, purchased for my wife, I ignored the review that said their display faded out because it supposedly had been corrected . . . well, apparently that is not the case, we've had ours less than two weeks and viola, the display has faded out and is now gone. This is a really nice looking and has a decent sound, I'm going to let them replace it once, if it happens again adios! . . . be warned!"
4,IPod cable,These are inexpensive iPad cables and work just fine. I seem to be pretty hard on these and go through them regularly. They last around a year or so.
3,"Weird fit, nice price","The price of this is unbeatable! But the fit of it in my families ipod touch and iphone is a little off. It is a tad tougher to push into the charge hole then the normal cable. and if it is not perfectly in it will say charging not enabled with this device. also, it seems to take longer to get a full charge with this cable. Good as a back up cable though."
5,Outstanding work!,"I was thoroughly impressed by this recording. Enchant is an outstanding progressive rock group! The vocals, musicianship, etc is extraordinary! If you like Rush, you will love Enchant!"
4,Worked; a little tricky,"I used this to power a cb radio in my 2001 toyota tacoma. I couldn't get it to work at first, and there's no good way to tell if you're doing something wrong or if something isn't working. What I did, and what I advise you to do, is to go to an auto parts store and pick up a $3 circuit tester to make sure you have everything plugged in the right way. This will save some hassle of making sure the circuit is good. Turned out the ground off the cb wasn't good enough, but after that I got it working just fine."
3,Average,"I wasn't too impressed with this text. I found that many of the chapters were incredibly verbose, and seemed to confuse me even more in some instances. Perhaps one of the problems (obviously not Brigham's fault) was that my prof ""wizzed"" through some of these chapters, so reading the ""wordy, never-ending"" chapters was overwhelming. Further, I think that some concepts could have been more simplified, when instead Brigham seemed to ramble and ""lost"" me.In short, I think some ""academics"" (profs, grad students, etc) might be impressed with the depth with which Brigham wrote. However, not all of the students are on the same level, and this must be taken into consideration when the author revises the text. We are using the text as a guide for learning, not as a means to evaluate the author's aptitude in the field of finance..."
5,The best in-print game book on Chinese martial arts,"This book is a great effort by Palladium, and manages to capture the feel of Hong Kong martial arts action. It expands upon the material already in the Ninjas & Superspies rulebook by adding 17 new character classes and dozens of new martial arts styles and special abilities. The various aspects of Chinese mythology and culture are especially well done, covering Chinese Names, Taoists and Taoism, Alchemy, Spells, Immortals, and Monsters.Written with flair and passion, this book is a joy to read despite the rules-heavy content, even for non-gamers. This is what GURPS martial arts should have been. A worthy addition to any roleplayer's shelf."
5,On target to increase your sales capacity!,"On target and once again the living proof that it is not necessary to have the perfect product, rather the perfect sales pitch, to be successful in selling. No matter if we are talking about the 1880s or the twenty-first century, if you can create the right interest, right sales tactics and create the demand, you will be successful. When you finish this book, you will come to realize that the only person holding you back is none other than yourself. Gitomer serves up a winner that stands heads and shoulders above the other ""How to sale your product"" books. Buy it, read it, and make your mark."
5,Amazing Gitomer Does it Again,"Crystal clear, on target and focused. Gitomer does it again, this time looking back 100 years to the principles that made NCR a household brand name. No matter what our own level of experience or knowledge, we can all learn something from the 32.5 principles Gitomer rediscovers in the career of John Patterson.There hasn't been so much useful research published since Joe Vitale's famous ""7 Lost Secrets of Success"" uncovered the forgotten techniques of Bruce Barton."
3,Gitomer RULES - but his head is one size too large in this go-around.,"I am a HUGE Gitomer fan. NO question about it. But every now and again, everyone needs a reality check. The Gitmeister resurrected the ASTONISHINGLY TIMELY (albeit 100 year old) work of John Patterson of National Cash Register, arguably the ""father of modern salesmanship"". But he seems to have found it necessary to attach his cart to Patterson's horse. Or should I say, attach Patterson's cart to a horse named Gitomer.My point is that Patterson's work can - and should - stand on its own. Footnotes or endnotes would have sufficed, but Git's added bits come-off as being at least a wee bit adolescent with a ""nyah, nyah... TOLD you so / see... I was RIGHT"" air. Still, you should NOT let that stand in the way of Patterson's stunning work. If you're in Sales, you MUST read this book. Like other Git material, it won't take long to get through it, it WILL make you smile, and it could make you RICH."
1,he's the bomb,hey the only thing that i ahve to say about this cd is it's the bomb i mean every song on the cd is hot no one could do it better
5,i like this album,"i like this album it's greatjust a friend (hit single)was nice song ,nice vedio clip,c'mon was a nice song eather,holla back,briad my hairy all these great song from mario the young new artist album.u got 2 buy the album"
4,not just a one hit wonder!,"I have to admit that when I saw the track listing and saw tracks like ""Braid my hair"" and ""Chick wit da braid"" I went, this is a joke, but to my suprise the album is pretty good! ""Braid my hair"" is so laid back and inviting, and I guess I don't have to say anything 'bout ""Just a friend""! ""What your name is"" is also a good track! This boy can sing and he delivers the the track (What your name is) so magnificently!!! ""Could you be"" follows in the same mood as ""What your name is"" and it's a wonderful track!! I love the album and I don't regret for a minute that I bought it!!This boy's gonna shake us all, he has potential, and he's a well apprecited addition in the already overpopulated R&B sector!!"
3,Fragile,"Works well like most people say here, but the rabbit ears are quite weak, even if you are careful with your electronics equipment. RCA does have a 1 year warranty, which I am using now to replace my broken antenna."
1,No. Too much advertising,"The entire tape clocks in at a shade under 40 minutes. Of this, the first ten minutes are advertisements and the last 30 seconds are devoted to yet another nick advertising blurb, making roughly 25% of the tape marketing for young minds. While our almost two-year old daughter enjoys the cartoon, I find the amount of time spent fast-forwarding to be annoying, so I probably won't be buying another Nick tape for my children again."
5,"Raw, Hard Hitting Rock","El Tri has been playing this brand of raunchy rock n roll for lord knows how many decades, and they still rock like never before!Alex Lora and la banda still have that sarcastic tone, and always find themes to exploit, make fun of or protest. The best tunes on this one are ""No te olvides.."", ""Chilangolandia"", ""Solamente dios"" and ""Partir de hoy"".If you like the old tri w/out the symphony, then this is for you."
3,A nice reference if you already know the basics,"I love pilates. It's a great workout, and you quickly feel the results. (If you have lower back pain, consider pilates. It strengthens your back muscles and may help to ease your pain.)If you have never done pilates before, this may not be the right starter kit for you. Pilates exercises are not necessarily intuitive. How your body is positioned is very important in pilates, and you may find it easier to learn with a video, so that you can watch how you body is supposed to move through each exercise.Once you've learned the basics, the flashcards will make your life easier. I take the flash cards with me when I travel. They're small, pack easily and serve as a great reference tool. With this in mind, if you are already familiar with pilates, the flash cards are worth the money."
2,"Buy a Book or DVD, this doesn't work",Don't bother buying this kit. It just doesn't work. If you are starting working with Pilates you will be lost. The positions on the cards are not explained well. That makes very difficult to understand the rhythm of the CD.For something like pilates you need good and detailed graphics or a video to clearly explain the positions and sequence of the exercises.I gave it 2 starts instead of 1 because Brooke Siler seems to know her stuff. She just need a better way to communicate it.
1,SCAM,"I fully expected to love this product. I have been practicing pilates for a number of years, but wanted something to motivate me to work out at home on my own time. I took the discs to 3 different DVD players in my home before realizing that they were audio CD's. Who in the world has ever heard of following exercises (especially ones that need to be done in such a precise manner) to an audio, as opposed to a video? While this workout has the potential to be terrific, I feel that I was totally scammed and the fact that it contains CD's should be made much more obvious."
5,With All Due Respect,"For the reviewers who make their opinions fact, I must say that this is really a subjective topic and depends on how you learn.I found that Ms. Siler's kit has already started to really work for me (I've had it only three weeks) and I have given it to others who feel the same. I like that I don't have to watch a video while I'm working out and I can easily follow Ms. Siler's instructions and then check the cards if necessary. I love that it's portable and I really feel it's well organized and I've used it more than any of the videos piled in my den.SO...If the new rule is to make our opinions fact than let me say definitively THIS PRODUCT WORKS!"
5,Much needed resource,A search of library sources locates nothing else comparable. The information is useful and the prints are well reproduced. Those interested in Indian contemporary art will be awaiting the additional proposed volumes.
3,"Good cover, but rips easily in some spots","This is a good cover made from decent waterproof materials. The only problem I have with it is that it rips easily around the area where the velcro straps are sewn to it. I still use it with the rips, it just looks ghetto."
4,Well made`grill cover,"This grill cover is well made and it fits the Ducane Affinity 3100 3-Burner Propane Gas Grill. I wish it were longer, it stops above the wheels of the grill."
2,Paid for 2 received one,I paid for two covers but received just one and no refund. Avoid this seller!
5,Ducane Affinity 3100 Natural Gas Grill,Grill cover fits like a glove and is made of good quality. Can't beat the quality backing of the Weber name. No complaints.
4,Sturdy but a little too snug of a fit.,One size fits all doesn't always mean it's easy to get on. This is a little too snug of a fit for my liking. I do like the quality of the product.
2,"Great service, lacking durability","Seller gets 5 stars. Product should get 3 or less. It is already splitting and cracking at the stress points (corners of the grill). I use this cover on my grill, as I do my grill, year round. I wouldnt have thought the winters in Northern Virginia too much for a grill cover. However, the cold weather coupled with stress at the corners of the side-counters of the grill have created splits and tears in the cover in only 3 weeks of use. I'm disappointed in the performance of the product and will not repeat this purchase."
5,Works Great!,"I have a 20' x 20' garage. This does a good job of heating it up quickly. I crack a window, just in case, but haven't noticed any fumes (seems to burn efficiently)."
2,Mr. Heater #MH80CV,"The unit lit easily and put out a lot of heat, but the person I bought it for thought it was too dangerous to use in her garage. I realize that a lot of people in the reviews thought it was fine in their garage. The Instruction manual, however says to be used in (large outdoor area such as a construction cite or large patio,) not a garage."
2,"Yup, it's bitter...","I think this book told me as much about Andrew Kazdin as it did about Glenn Gould. I recently read an article about Andrew Kazdin's technique in the recording studio. He likes to have control. But you see, so did Glenn Gould... I'm astounded that Kazdin and Gould were able to work together for as many years as they did. And they did do great work together during those years.Still, go ahead and read this book, if you have a chance, because it does have a lot of details and insight into Glenn Gould in the recording studio. You must take some of Andrew Kazdin's assertions with a grain of salt, however."
3,good but unrealistic,"In this book, Max decides to move the colt Samson to another barn to benefit his training. Lisa and Carole are heartbroken and set about trying to prove that Samson belongs at Pine Hollow. It seemed kind of neglible that he kept letting the girls (who didn't know what they were doing) work with the colt. That's how bad habits get started. Meanwhile, Stevie is visiting her cousin Angela. Angela used to be horse crazy, but now all she can think about is her Sweet Sixteen party, and she's a cheerleader! Can Stevie salvage her visit, even when weather threatens to ruin the party?"
5,Great Read,A great book on evangelism for the church. The author makes some very valid and striking statements about the status of today's church.
3,So-so,"I'm not a southern gospel fan, and this album's a bit heavy on what I call sleepy-time waltzes. It was recommended along with a bunch of bluegrass."
1,Re-records..what can you say. Oh licensed from K-Tel.,"Many, many weak tracks. An older Mungo Jerry singing 'Baby Jump', wholly smokes thats painful! Mostly British act here.I can't say anything else...except this has no value to me as K-Tel has released and re-released this stuff many times and of course releasing their 'licensed' music to others too. The group 'The Byrds' sing 'Chestnut Mare', it must be song by a member of their roadie group or me?Save your money..."
2,Investing Like a pro,"This is not a book for beginners. Like a lot of these books, it's for people who have a basis of some kind n finance.What would help is a book that doesn't try to be cute...this is a book about money. Money isn't cute. ""Just the facts, Ma'am.""It's too complicated.I would love a book that understands people who do NOT understand the market, and starts at point A and goes to point Z, AND BE CONSISTENT in every chapter.EXAMPLE:this is a stock...this is bond...this is a Mutual fund...this is a whatever...And so forth.Here's how to use them to your advantage...etc.I will keep searching for a book that actually helps."
2,Rush Job?,"First of all, I love this album. I consider it to be the best Monkees album, and a good example of what the band, with producer Chip Douglas and select session musicians could have been capable of producing for the rest of the decade.Having said that - this two-disc ""deluxe edition"" doesn't offer much added value over Rhino's one-disc edition. It contains mono versions of the tracks, so if you need those - great. If not, the alternate takes aren't much more interesting than what exists on the first edition.Now here's the bad part. Rhino was very sloppy in assembling the bonus tracks. In a few cases, bits of one track flow over onto another track number. This could easily have been rectified, so I'll just chalk it up to a rush job on Rhino's part."
4,"The last ""really good"" Monkees album","Some really good things on the CD, one of the last really good efforts by the Monkees - except for the latter day reunion CD, Justus, which was also pretty darned good in a different way!"
3,Fair discussion of newer tools,"The treatment of newer statistical tools (multivariate analyses) is covered in this book, with different authors writing the different parts. This can help to keep the material fresh, but it also gives each section a disjointed feel, as some sections are very long and comprehensive and others are quite short. The book makes a case for using newer tools such as cluster analysis in place of some other typically-used tools (e.g., discriminant analysis, factor analysis) as a fresher approach; This is fine because many dissertations and published studies are using more and more qualitative methods (or mixed methods) these days, but it should put them into context - no cluster analysis will ever be as robust as a factor analysis."
5,Great Learning Help,"I bought this product because my granddaughter was showing interest in the meaning of words. When she was 34 months old she viewed the first DVD twice a day for two weeks when she caught on to the concept. She learned all the words on the second DVD in five days. The third DVD only took her two days to learn. Now we read many books together every day. She reads the words she knows and I read the rest. What a bonding experience it has been! She reads words from the newspaper and on signs. She will soon be reading independently. It's amazing what a child can learn at this tender age! My granddaughter is standing at my side as I am writing this review, pointing out and reading all the words she knows! I would recommend this set of DVDs to anyone with a preschool age child."
5,Great for learning sight words,"I was skeptical at first about this DVD set since the way the words are depicted have nothing to do with the word it represents. Like the word ""and"" is a chameleon chasing a fly. But the representations seem to stick and my daughter (22 months) learned the words from the first DVD in a couple of weeks and is able to point them out when she sees them in books and on signs."
2,VERY BASIC-Get Leapfrog instead,"I have purchased Your baby can read, Leapfrog and now this..this is wayyyyyy to slow to keep a childs atten. Mine is 4, starting prek next week, knows some words, but not reading yet, he's not a genius, but by no means slow either. Leapfrog was definately a better buy..the phonics, word factory, etc..we watched the 1st one last night and it is just animated things w/music in background, no storyline, etc..and then it just starts over again, my son says, ""we already saw this, can we change it now?"" so that was a waste of money. dont' waste your money on this one. My son can watch leapfrog over and over again and not get bored..all it does is repeat the words over and over, doesn't use them in sentences, give examples, etc..just repetition-BORING!"
5,"GREAT, MY LO LUVS IT!",My little guy loves loves loves preschool prep company dvds! This is a really great way for them to learn sigh words! You just gotta be watchful so that they dont get too much into the repitition like way of using these words! Great set!
3,Kinda dissapointed,"Well, I personally think these are awful. I bought them because of all the great reviews.My son and daughter, ages 2 & 4, like them though, so I gave it 3 stars. They are so repetitive and boring, not to mention strange. Maybe they will help my kids, I don't know, but I can't stand to be in the room."
5,Amazing videos,I bought these video's for my 5 year old and 4 year old and they love it. We have been working with the first video and they are doing very well at pointing out words they recognize now. I am using this along with a Hooked on Phonics program to teach them to read. My kids LOVE books this is a wonderful program and it was very nicely done. They see the words in plain print and in a cartoonish way to help make learning fun and to help remember them.
3,Hours of entertainment,"My 2 year old son loves these, but my 3.5 year old son has no interest in them. So hit or miss for them. So in my opinion, get if your child is 2.5 or younger."
4,Volunteer Blue Light,"The product works as specified. However, if I want to mount it to the top of my Vehicle, the cord is not long enough. Mounted inside on the dashboard, the unit makes a lot of noise and I had to build a baffle to block the light from distracting me. It's definitely bright enough and can be seen well enough for my purposes."
1,noisy stuff,"so noisy , i can't use it. if ur sitting inside the car , then u can't do anything. It gives you headache."
4,A little cheap but great!,"I bought one of these lights when I joined my local fire department. The light was fairly bright and able to make people move over on the roads, especially at night. The car jack end broke, partially because it is a lightweight plastic and partially because I accidentally closed it in my car door. Most car jacks wouldn't hold up to that. I replaced that and added a bit more cord to it, and I was all set. The light didn't scratch the top of my car either. A good deal."
4,Great manet light,"Great with a light bar to perform your intended function, I use in my vehicle as backup on work grounds. I did get a first one and it came with a crack in the dome<yikes>. but the seller VERY quickly re-sent a new one overnight, so I'm am quite happy with them. Not killer bright, but visible in all but the brightest sun...."
2,Cheap light,"I use this light at work all the time, as security. It is decently bright, but kinda loud. It could be a little bit brighter and quieter. But for the price, it works just fine. Lets people know you're there and that's all that matters. Update: The wire broke where it meets the cigarette lighter. So it only works if I push the wire in. Cheap & crappy, I've barely even used it, and its already broken. So, you get what you pay for. My advice, pay more for something better quality. Wheller is supposed to be a good brand. Wolo sucks!"
3,You get what you pay for,"This seemed like a basic, inexpensive light...comparable to what used to be available at the local auto parts store at double the price. Perfect for the volunteer firefighter just starting out. It is pretty sturdy, but the cord is very short and doesn't really reach to the roof. You can throw it on the dash, but measure carefully as mine doesn't really fit on the dash. A little velcro helps keep it in place. Sometimes the reflector thingy inside spins and sometimes it does not. Effective at night, but not so much during the day. It will hold me until I can get a light bar for the roof."
3,It's okay.,"I was hoping for more variety, wanted some mellow along with the intense. Overall the recording is good but would have given more stars if arranged with more of their variety."
3,Booklet is overpriced,I thought that I was getting a book and when I opened the mail and saw that I had paid ... for a very small stapled booklet I was really surprised! Then I thought that the information might be helpful enough to be worth the money. After reading through the material I couldn't say that it would be helpful for a preschooler. The booklet is not informative enough nor is there any book binding that would cause it be worth [this much]. I returned the booklet. I did find what I was looking for ...
5,"Great, consistent listen!","I bought this CD, having been lead to it by the links from Matthew Sweet and Velvet Crush, and am now physically incapable of removing it from my car CD player. I don't generally buy compilations or soundtracks due to the uneven quality, but this disc is amazingly consistent in quality, while showcasing a variety of bands and styles. High points for me - Gigolo Aunts,Wondermints, and Velocity Girl.."
2,Alternative/Glam rock,"There are a few good songs(Violet High, Supergod, The hive) but the rest is just simplistic filler to me. I like the vocals. They are sort of feminine sounding actually. It was just a little too simple and not catchy enough for me."
4,pretty damn good,"I picked up this album as a promo for a concert I went to. I had no idea what they would sound like and to my delight they were a good alternative sounding band. I dont give this CD five stars because I think they couldve found a better vocalist, but other than that the band is excellent instrumentally and execute their sound very well."
1,not as advertised,"This book was advertised as having a CD-ROM with it. It was not included. I emailed the seller about it and have gotten no response. I paid for the book & the CD-ROM and would appreciated getting what I paid for. Also, the book ad stated that it was lightly used, however there are many pen & highlighter markings all throughout the book. All of the answers are marked on the test! Overall, I am greatly dissappointed with this purchase!"
2,ok only..... until the handle came loose,"I have had this product for 3 or 4 years now. It hasn't really done a lot of heavy duty, but I have found that it is not the easiest to move the saw around. The concept is good, but the tires get stuck easily and don't roll over much very well.My biggest problem happened today when I was moving my bosch 4100 up from my basement to do some cutting today. The saw is difficult to pull up a stairwell, but I have done it many times. For some reason.... today the handle broke loose suddenly and I watched helplessly as my saw tumbled back into the basement doorwell.Now I have a non-functional saw. The fence was destroyed as was the saw blade. There are many dings and gouges from the concrete.Perhaps it was my fault to some degree, but this stand has always been difficult for me to move the saw with."
3,It was just ok,"Entertaining. The acting was not that great but to be expected. It took me back to the 90s. Overall, a solid movie."
4,Interesting movie,"I enjoyed watching this movie of a great entertainer. Just one of the many stories of how creativity, desire & relentless effort can bring forth an American dream. This story, his story is like many untold African American stories of triumph over adversity & stereotype. A story of how values, morals & relationships must remain on positive to keep the Dream alive & how being misguided in this truth will destroy you and the Dream."
5,Beautiful!,"If you have not been to China, this book is a partial introduction. The photography and drawings show the ability to capture the emotion.It is more than adequate reason to have this book. We do not learn everything in one or even a multitude of classes. The book could be considered many classes and or beginnings."
5,great speaks,"easy enough to install and they sound great. i drive an 88 aries and they fit in perfectly. i dont have any subs or amps and it still sounds amazing. then again im comming from 23 year old factory speakers but still. if you got the money, invest it"
5,One of the Best in Homeopathy for the Lay Person,"Clarke's Prescriber is one of the great tools to help anyone make a very good choice of what remedy to take, Other repertories are far more difficult to use and Clarke helps guide you well. He was a very good homeopath and this book should be on every family first aid shelf.Too bad the other reviewers didn't read the book, and use the book. Of course the text was photocopied because if it had been OCRd it would be a terrible mess. The photo copy is as easy to read as the original."
2,Not original battery - Be careful,"I bought the N-Gage Lithium-Ion battery a few weeks ago, and my old battery keeps more charge than the one this seller had sent. First of all it comes lose and not as shown in the picture. I am pretty sure that this is not a new battery. If you want to be sure you get a new battery, buy from a well known cellphone accessories site."
5,It's a classic,"I've been in Hank's fan club since 1978. Have all original albums dating back from 1964, and this is one of the best. Great songs, strong voice for a young man . It is great to release an album that has such feelings. No one else could have done it better. I fyou dont have it, you need to purchase it ...well worth the money."
3,the best in the series so far that I've read.,This book scared me pretty bad but its more mild than a Stephen King novel!! I enjoyed it very much if you like mildly scary books this series is for you!!
4,Blending of Time and Characters for a Single Theme,"Caryl Phillips' novel, The Nature of Blood, is an unusual read with its four major storylines shifting the readers focus around the globe and through time. The amazingly wonderful thing is how the author is able to adroitly pull all of these threads together to create a marvelous whole. The tales of prejudice tell a horrifyingly universal story but the individual characters within the stories speak of some hope amidst the anguish. It is a cleverly crafted work that turns history on its head in showing how times change but human emotions remain steadfastly consistent, both good and bad. A short, interesting, powerful read."
1,Poor service,"The books was said to be new,It was torn,the pages were bent, the outside covers was very worn. And they charged me even more than was put inside the cover,it had stamped used inside, but was sold to me as new..I will never buy from this place again.Plus took order for ever to get here.I also collect Sheri Whitefeather books so was very disapointed."
3,Wasn't what I expected....,"Received the Pioneer CDSR 100 Remote and was very impressed at its compact size. The controls are very easy to access and can be operated with ease while driving. Attaching it to the steering wheel took a little time but after studying the figures in the directions--the remote wasn't very hard to put on at all. The only noticable problem(trying to eliminate this problem by repositioning the remote on the steering wheel)is the radio receiving the commands from the remote. I couldn't get the remote to work the radio while attached to the left side of the steering wheel. Is it too far from the radio?? I will try moving the remote to different locations on the steering wheel and see what that does. Otherwise, I like the size and the control functions of the remote."
4,"Not a favorite, but hopefully one day...","I recently purchased 4 Haba toys for my 9 month old. He seemed interested in Ballino the first day, but hasn't spent much time with it since. His favorite is Trix which he plays with for a long time, taking it around the house, banging it on furniture and, of course, chewing on it. He also really likes Flapsi because there are interesting things to look at, it makes a neat sound when he flaps it and he likes chewing on the head and tail. He doesn't spend much time at all with Haba's Triangle, but obviously every child will have different preferences. I am still very happy to have tried them all and hope that he will go through different stages when he will find them all interesting. Right now he is mostly interested in inspecting EVERYTHING in the house which is why I purchased more toys! But I think I'm just going to have to let him explore awhile!"
4,For a little older baby..maybe,"my 7 mo loves seeing me click and clack on this ball but it wasn't until a couple months ago that she could hold it. and still she doesn't usually pick it up because it is a bit heavy and she needs two hands to pick it up and can't really make noise with it by herself. it is very durable though, it has dropped off of the baby swing many times and there are no scratches. maybe as an older child she will be able to play it with it herself. it certainly is cool for me to look at."
4,Thoughtful and thought provoking,"Paul Tremblay is a true craftsman, and his literate stories will create emotions in readers similar to those of such luminaries as Ray Bradbury and Harlan Ellison. There is an insightful intelligence at work here, and a love of language, but these stories are easily digested. The 20 tales are assembled in the chronological order of a man's lifetime, but they are only connected thematically; each gem exists unto itself. ""The Harlequin and the Train,"" ""With More Than Eyes,"" ""4'33"" and ""The Laughing Man Meets Little Cat"" are just some of the treasures you'll discover, and they will stand the test of time. Like Bradbury and Ellison, Tremblay is more interested in exploring the human condition than in limiting himself to any one genre, and anyone who reads this book will likely be as impressed by the breadth of material as they will be by the quality of the stories themselves. Get on this train now."
3,replacement pieces & manual,"I got this board at a reduced cost from a scholastic fair because the pieces and manual is missing. anyone know where i can order replacement pieces. can someone scan a copy of the manual and put a link online? someone had posted a link to replacement parts but it does not show up. maybe you have to type ""dot"" for the relevant part of the address."
4,crokinole board,bought as a gift....haven't seen it used yet...hope it is as good as the old ones made of real wood.... basically it looks the same but with many more game options.....
3,Carom Board,This was a gift for an 11 year old boy - my husband loved his carom board as a kid and thought this boy would like it - his reaction - faked appreciation - he was looking for electronic games. Times change and this may become a toy of the past.
5,I LOVE THIS GAME,"i dont even have this game, but i really do love it from time ago. i passed many hours playing this as a child only wish i could afford to buy one for myself. Please email me if you would like to contribute to my ""Carroms Fund"". i would greatly appreciate it so that i may once again relive my childhood experiences. thank you"
2,"good concept, flimsy product that is cheaply made","I bought this game board for our family, thinking we would have it for years and use it often.We used the carrom board, without the dowels, and the game was fun, but as others said, here are the main flaws:- the ""cues"" are wooden dowels with a rubber piece on the end- the pieces are thin & hollow, light plastic- the game board itself is very thin plywood, and even separated when we took it out of the box!- the nets (or pockets) are held in place by a thin wire that runs around the perimeter of the board, and they can easily be stretched out of place by anyone, especially kids taking out the piecesNote: This is not carrom as played in the UK or India/Pakistan. If you are looking for that, look elsewhere.Overall, it's a great concept & seemingly priced well, but it's so cheaply made it will not last.I returned this board for a refund after having it fall apart after one-time use."
3,worth buying for me,"The first CD, The Sands '61, is the best live performance for that time period I've ever heard. The band is great, horns and strings.The next CD recorded in 65 with Basie is good, but you can hear the voice fading in excellence. Basie band is great. If only Frank never smoked.The third CD is a DVD. 1981. Good but no longer has the voice. Worth a listen. It is Frank. My first live show was '80, great band, great show.The next 2 are in his later years. You decide. I will listen to these recordings from time to time.Later."
5,I DIG IT,"I like this CD.I've just received it today and really dig it.Hope there will be more to come in the future.ALBERT is a cool ballad,Graves is bone crunching metal all the way.Bedtime is another.BUY IT!!"
1,After 10 minutes - find another,"Once you get past the girl's locker room scene - which works good in slow motion - find another movie to watch. If you're looking for some kind of story with T & A and decent sex, this ain't it babe."
2,Disappointing,"I had my introduction to Chadwick through the Jarvi disk of the 2nd and 3rd symphonies, which I thought fantastic, especially the third. Next to that, I found this music disappointing. It reminded me of warmed-over Victor Herbert band music (with whom Chadwick is largely contemporaneous). Now I have to decide whether I want to continue and buy the Symphonic Sketches. Perhaps, if one day I have $14 burning a hole in my pocket, I'll risk it. I do heartily recommend the symphonies, though."
4,This book was the best ! ! ! !,I think this book was the best because i liked how grumpy Vera Donovan tricked Dolores and how Dolores tricked Vera.But i think the best part was when Dolores killed her....... well i think all let you figure that out yourself.if your interested in this book buy it at the local bookstore thanx bye
3,A good book to read when you have nothing else to do.,"King is one of my favorite authors, I have read a majority of his books (The Stand, Cujo, Misery, It, etc.) Money and time willing I want to read all of his books. Out of his books that I read, Dolores Claiborne, is the most unique. First, it is one continuous chapter (which I dislike) and it doesn't really fit into King's genre. I really didn't find it very suspensful, but at times I did get a few chuckles. It was interesting in following Dolores' life on the island and the challenges she went through in raising her family and having a drunk as a husband. Overall, Dolores Claiborne is an interesting book, and I am looking forward to reading Geralds Game and finding the relationship between the two books."
4,This book is awesome!,"I thought this book was very good! It gets very intense in the middle of the book when Dolores decides she's gunna go through with her plan of killing her husband. I love Stephen King books. He's such an awesome author.Mrs. Galloway- Mountain View High School, Boise, ID"
2,Dull,"I am a big King fan but this book isn't very good. It's written in a difficult to read one-long-chapter style and the plot is razor thin, yet he stretches it out for hundreds of pages. There are a few riveting scenes. Unfortunately you have to plow through hundreds of pages to find them. Or do what I did and skim, skim, skim until you find something interesting to read."
3,The movie is much better!,"I can't knock the book, really... It's just that the movie is so much more engaging and descriptive. Having been a nurse and in home hospice caregiver, I feel that Stephen King must have been in the trenches himself in order to portray the dichotomy and ambivalence of emotions in this wonderful story. All caregivers should read this AND see the movie!!"
5,This book is Stephen King at his best,"When Dolores is found holding a rolling pin over the head of her former employer, her dead former employer she became the prime suspect in what was thought of as a murder investigation but when Dolores tells her side of the story nobody could have imagined the truth, maybe she didn't kill, this time! Stephen King has never written such a moving story of love, loyalty and murder."
5,"Exellent, I will read it again and again.","How does he do it? Every time he writes a book it has me caught from beginning to end, and Dolores Claiborne is no exception. Despite the fact that she has killed her husband, you can still feel a sympathy for her, and by the end of the book you really feel like you know her. I think Stephen King has really managed to capture the bond between a mother and her children, and he has made me feel that, put in those situations that she did the right thing. He has also shown though how she has really had to srtuggle to come to terms with what she has done, and that it hasn't been as easy as the locals think it has been on her. I really loved the book, and all I could think at the end was, why has it ended already! The film was a real dissapointment, although Kathy Bates really played Dolores well, the way it was done was terrible, they didn't do justice to such an excellent book."
2,Dolores Claiborne,"This book was ok to read, but like all his new books IT'S NOT A GOOD BOOK. Get back to the good stories. sind disappointed"
1,Unkingly,"Even though Stephen King wrote this novel, it was as good as the sitcoms on the WB. I have one word to describe it: horrible. It's a rare case where the movie exceeded the novel."
2,Sticky Sweet,"Not my favorite. Tina Malia's voice is a little too sticky sweet for my taste, and every song sounds alike."
5,Marvin at his finest,This is a great dvd. Crystal clear and has always Marvin proves that he is an entertainer. Definitely for his fans!!!
4,Not for the faint of heart!,"This heartstopping end to the two book story about Jack the Ripper written by Ms. Douglas has heart-stopping action from the beginning to the end. The book continues the story of Irene Adler's search for her missing husband and her missing companion. The book flips back and forth from Irene and her group and to Nell and Godfrey who are being held captive in a decaying castle in Transylvania. This is a much darker story than Chapel Noir, but the plot is gripping, and as always, Ms. Douglas' period detail is wonderful. I know that I couldn't put the book down. There's not much mystery in this one though, but the theories that are put forth as to the identity of Jack the Ripper are intriguing. This is a wonderful series and Irene Adler is a great character."
1,It was awful,"When I first picked up A David Eddings Book it was Pawn of Prophesy. I have to say I was riveted and loved every minute of it. Then as I read further into his novels I began to see how it was all the same. The same characters with different names. There is always a Belgarath type character (Althaus, Mark, Sparhawk) always a Polgara type character (Serphenia, the lady who owned the house in Regina' song, and Emmy.) And they always play the same roles.I noticed as I was reading the Begarath the Sorcerer that Eddings even put it in his writing, how the character noticed how things had a way of repeating itself until the error that caused the whole problem was fixed. Which basically said ""I only have one story line so I have to alter it accordingly to fit all my new books.Regina's song was no different. It was the same story with different characters and it was boring and old. I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone."
1,What were they thinking?,"After reading this book, you will neither know or care which of the twins died. All I can say is the surviving one was pretty dull. They try and make her seem intriguing by having her write a Freshman English Comp paper that shows her sane/insane worldview. It then get shown to anyone and everyone in the book to show how extrordinary she is. I showed her ""paper"" to friends for laughs and we all agreed that her paper would be a joke in high school and would certainly not have her ""brother"" be told by his boss in the English department that she must become an English major. All in all, everyone seemed to be too perfect in their area of expertise, while still not being interesting enough to make the reader care if they lived or died after the book was over."
2,Another Let Down,"Edding's previous fantasy trilogies pinned me to my chair and quickly established him in my own mind at least as a writer to follow. Regina's Song however drives home the point that The Redemption of Althalus hinted at, Davey boy isn't getting better with age. Regina's Song streches too many pages for a story that could have been told without the jabber of the unbelievable characters. If you're a die hard Eddings fan try this one on for size, but don't go in with Eddings like expectations."
1,"If you're thinking about reading this book, THINK AGAIN!!!","Ok, I picked this book up in the bookstore, and like most other people was very intrigued by the whole murdered twin idea. As I was reading it I became annoyed with the main characters, the boarding house group. It seems that all of their dialogue was recycled throughout the book.Finally I got to an interesting part of the book, (spoiler ahead) after Twinkie had killed the last guy, in the church Mark and the priest see two twins. They could have gone so many different ways with that plot twist, but no, Mark and the priest decide NEVER TO TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!! The story just goes downhill from there.If you are even thinking about reading this book, DON'T. You might get more fulfillment from watching paint dry."
2,production a mess; solid songwriting talent,"an ""everything-but-the-kitchen-sink"" sonic approach mars what might have been a notable debut. catch her live if you can; she's very bright and sweet (and cute as a button!), and the stripped-down arrangements are vast improvements upon the album versions. julia's got potential; let's hope when a major label picks her up they'll pair her with the right producer for her next record."
2,Complicated,"-This book is not written for the average caveman. While reading it, and I did read the whole thing, I found myself blah blah blahing in my head until I hit an interesting point or two.-It is a really indepth look at the hypothesis that is featured and simplified in ""The Warrior Diet"" book. If I was able to skim through this in a book store I more than likely would not have bought it and read it. While I fully recomend the latter I do not recomend ""Maximum Muscle: Minimum Fat""."
3,Ori's latest venture,"Ori Hofmekler has written a very thorough, detailed explanation of the science behind his ""Warrior Diet"" philosophy. He has obviously done his homework on this one. Metabolism, hormone secretion and muscle growth are just a few things Ori covers this time around. If you read his other book ""The Warrior Diet"" and had any questions as to what is going on inside the body's systems, they are no doubt answered in this book."
5,super,"wonderful, it brought back memories of when i was growing up in the 50s watching superman. keep the memory of george reeves alive.thank you"
3,Basically a tinted sunscreen,"This product is great if you basically just want a tinted sunscreen with a little coverage. It felt as if it was drying the second I started rubbing it in, which made blending difficult. But it matched my skin tone perfectly so any blending issues were not noticable. It did not offer much covereage, so you'll still need concealer for any blemishes or skin discolorations. I wore it all day, even through a rigorous workout, and it never felt dirty or greasy."
3,Good but not great,"Came across this compilation while looking for a song that is by Brass Construction. This collection is Ok, but it doesn't even have Do You Like It. If you are familiar with this band you know that you have to have that jam. However if you like BT(thats what we called them back in the day), you have to check out Brass Construction. They bought sound pretty much the same but (to me), Brass definitely has a deeper library..."
3,Isn't as good as I remembered,"I had a few Camel CD's and tapes in the past (20+ years sgo) and liked them then. After hearing them again many years later, I think they are a little cheesy. Not all of their songs are, but they aren't quite as interesting to me as Yes, King Crimson, Floyd, Tull, or Rush. They have their moments, kind of like ELP, or Kansas, but not as widely known."
4,Excellent book that cover detailed bio of the biggest names in financial market,"This is an excellent book that cover detailed biographies, and more importantly the trading strategies, of the biggest names in financial market, such as Benjamin Graham, Philip Fisher, Warren Buffett, Jim Rogers, George Soros, Julian Robertson, Peter Lynch and John Templeton, to mention a few. Need I say more?"
5,"Ethnography, Globalization, and a Host of Other Things",In this book Wormsley provides an intricately detailed look at his time in Tona living amongst the Imbonggu. Though the book is short he is able to capture the essence of a people in a time of change and his connection to them on a level that is far more human than most other simple ethnographies. He also provides a look in to the psyche of the anthropologist before during and after his fieldwork by showing many of the reactions and realities previously known only to those practicing anthropology currently.
2,"Not the same ""road"" as Diana Ross","Despite Gladys' feeling that she was overshadowed at Motown by Diana Ross, she is a decent vocalist and I commend her on her new spiritual direction after her struggles with gambling. If only Ms. Gladys could recapture the fun and soul of ""Love Overboard"" ""Lovin' on Next to Nothing, and ""Taste of Bitter Love"", she would be on the right path. Even if she and Diana did not get along and she felt that some songs she sung better than Diana-even this with the great songs-we can forgiver her."
5,Most Listened To CD in my Collection,This is the album that turned me onto Gram Parsons and then the Flying Burrito Brothers. I came across this purely by accident but what a gem it is. A long time fan of Emmylou Harris I'm simply blown away by the energetic yet beautiful duet. About the only thing more I could wish for is this CD to be longer or have a second disc I could buy.
1,Did you forget America?,When are we going to take a good look at ourselves? If you believe that Reagan's weapons give-away was an isolated incident think again! Just like a shoplifter - for every 1 that is caught there are 100s more that aren't. We not only have a history of giving away weapons we also have a history of training those who would do us harm - Osama Bin Laden was one of our prized students!!We are in every way more destructive to ourselves than our greatest enemies could ever be.
5,PERFECT COMPANION,"This kit is the PERFECT COMPANION to my Kodak Z812 IS 8MP. You can transfer your pictures to your computer with ease, keep your digital camera display free of smudges, and carry your camera in the handy camera bag. Plus, place the camera on the dock, and keep it charged and ready to go. I consider the Dock to be a MUST HAVE accessory!"
1,Kodak Dock not for Networked Computers,"I bought the Z612 and camera dock series 3. You have to be an adminstrator to install the software and you have to be an adminstrator to use the software. This is ok on a home computer BUT not on a Network computer. Once the adminstrator installs the Easyshare software, it will not let you see the camera on your computer. Called Kodak and they said that's right and they aren't going to change it. Now i have a useless dock that i wasted $42 on. Oh it does charge the batteries but there was a charger with the camera before i bought the useless dock."
4,Kodak Camera Dock,"It is great,but not as easy a fit for the camera. My older Kodak camera dock was a nice fit for the camera I had.The camera I have is wobbly on the dock."
3,how does this work?,so far I haven't been able to get this to work??????? I work a lot of hours and don't have a lot of free time to mess around with it. Maybe it's a defective unit?????
2,Kodak EasyShare Camera Dock Kit,"The docking station is great, but the camera case is way to small. When I purchased the kit I thought it was made for my wifes Kodak Z812IS, but the camera needs to be half the size. Then on top of that the battery that comes with this kit will not work with this camera. I will think twice about buying items like this online in the future."
5,Kodak Easyshare Camera Docking Kit 3-Series,"Kodak Easyshare Camera Docking Kit 3-Series Is A Wonderful Product To Sync Your Pictures To Your Computer Using Your Kodak Software And Charging Your Battery, But Best of All Maintaining Your Camera As Well!!![...]100% Recommended"
2,Price hiked from box,When I opened the camera dock: On the box was a price of $19.50 and I paid $40.94 for it. That is a 200% profit for somebody. Not happy about that. When I contacted Amazon I got no where with a person who was very hard to understand due to accent. Also the battery that came with the dock did not fit my camera as was promised in the demographics. Had to buy a new rechargable battery for $38 dollars. I retrospect I should have waited until Kodak got them in stock and ordered it there for cheaper but I have delt with amazon before and was happy. We be more careful and will send things back in the future since amazon would not price adjust.
1,Wrong Battery!,"I was very dissapointed to find the battery included in this kit was not the correct one for my camera. I thought I had researched it properly and selected the correct item, only to find the battery did not fit. I kept the kit because I needed the charger, but had to buy an additional battery."
1,did'nt work,"My computer did not recieve the connection. had a new computer coming. did'nt work on new one either. my 30 days have past so i'm stuck with it!!!! Camera connects, so it is not the cord, it is the dock"
2,It did not solve my problem,"I received a Kodak EasyShare C613 digital camera for an early Christmas gift. I called Kodak for instructions to connect the camera to my TV/DVR so I could use it like my previous Canon style camera. I was told that the ""dock"" would solve that problem. The camera connects to the dock, but THIS camera does NOT have the AV capabilities. Therefore, I need to send the dock back to Amazon for a refund."
4,OUTLAWS Fan? Buy this CD:,"Do you recall hearing the title cut ""Hittin' the Road"" hittin' the radio airways back in 1993? That's what drove me to pick this CD up shortly after its release. I was very pleasantly surprised to how good it is. I was also fortunate to see this version of Hughie's OUTLAWS live in Big Flats, NY in 1994 (pre Skynyrd) - They were very good.If you are an OUTLAWS fan and don't have this one, I highly recommend it. You won't be sorry.H.T., RIP."
1,Waste of money,These DVDs are the most BORING DVDs I have purchased for my daughter. I can't believe so many people like them. As an educator and a parent I am shocked they have received any awards. Buy the Leap Frog DVDs instead especially the Letter Factory and Numberland.
3,Ok,"I bought this item and also the Leapfrog series. This series is rather boring for my 2 1/2 year-old. He hates to watch any of them. It would probably be better suited for a younger child, maybe 1+. There really isn't a story line, it simply says the letter name/sound OVER and OVER and OVER again while showing the letters.The plus to this series is that it includes capital and lower-case letters, as well as several different types of fonts for each letter."
5,gift for grandson,My grandson loves to watch dvd's and movies. He will watch these and doesn't realize he is learning. He likes the videos at nap time.
1,not entertaining at all,"I was sorely disappointed in this dvd set. My (almost) 3 year old thought that it was very boring, and didn't sit through any of them. My ten month old couldn't have cared less. I sent it back and got the my baby can read series and everyone is loving them. Don't waste your money....."
1,Disappointed with these videos,"I bought this video set for my 22-month old son (read great reviews about it), hoping it will make him learn the basics. Sad to say, not even one of the videos were able to hold his attention. After 5 minutes, he just turns off the tv. My husband found the videos boring, and my son did as well. Very disappointed. I'll be having another baby soon. I will try to introduce these videos to her at a much younger age and see how it'll go."
2,Not what I thought..,My son is 2 and so far has absolutely NO interest in any of these DVD's at all whatsoever.I can't seem to sell it to him. I heard and read such great things about this series and stupidly bought it sight unseen.Sorry I did. A waste of money. They come highly decorated too...huh.
5,Excellent,"I love this series. It is the best series I have found for effective DVD learning. takes enough time with each item, keeps things interesteing without getting boring."
3,Product Rating,"The product was alright but did not ""wow"" me with its presentation. It could have been intuitive as with the ""child can read product""."
5,Amazing Mahler No 8,"I have a few of versions of Mahler No. 8 including Gary Bertini, Bernstein(DG),Tennstedt. This is the most favorate one with perfect balance among soloists, orchestra, and chorus by Solti. The tracks #12 and #16 really touch my hear. Amazing Mahler ...... marvelous Solti ...... Even though it was recorded more than 40 years ago, the sound quality is very good."
4,Good value,"Got this to use with a pin nailer.It's compact, easy to use and does the job. I find the coiled hose annoying as you really can't stretch it to the full length and manuever the tool without feeling quite a tug. But most compressors seem to use this hose.The controls are easy to see and adjust. I only gave it four stars because I feel it's pretty noisy but then I'm not an expert in this area.It does the job at a reasonable price."
4,I liked it,"I first heard this CD when I was playing laser tag and it was in the background music. I heard the first song on the CD and when the game was over I went to the manager and asked him what song that was, he showed me the cd and I couldn't find it anywhere but here. This CD has a bunh of great songs by people you've never heard of and cant find in mp3's. They may not be very famous, but it sure sounds good."
3,"good topic, but i was hoping for more indepth info",the part about salinity of sea water is most interesting. after that the book become to easy to read for layman.
2,"Good product, very bad packaging by Amazon, causes damage in shipping","I ordered two pads of this paper. It's great paper.The problem is that Amazon packed the two pads very poorly. They were loose in a huge box (about 9"" by 7"" by 16""), with only a few air-cushion packets -- not even close to enough to hold the pads in place during shipping. So the cardboard backing sheered off, and some additional pages sheered off the back as well.For the first time ever in the many years I've been using Amazon, I have to contact them about damage in shipping, and it's about such a silly item. But at $7 per pad, this is not acceptable."
2,Not Very Durable,"Got the case December 25th...here, not even a month later it is falling apart and full of cracks. Expected it to hold up a bit better and for a bit longer.Might be okay for someone that uses ther phone only one in a while, not daily."
2,Didn't last long,"It seemed to work well at first, but even just regular use it started cracking and falling apart. It only lasted a month."
2,Hp 96 Black & Hp 97 Color Ink Cartridges (Pack of 2),"Since I have purchased this product, the first time I replaced the Ink Cartridges on 1/26/2010, both worked ok.The very next day my HP DeskJet 6980 printer STOP printing, the ink indicator were solid.The ONLY way my Pinter would work, is by removing the color ink cartridge from my printer.So I paid for a package of 2 ink cartridges and I can ONLY use the back ink cartridge to get my printer to work .This is unacceptable and if someone needs to correct this situation please relay to my e-mail on how to do so."
1,This book is absolute rubbish!!!,"I had to give this book 1 star because there is no 0 star option. If you find this book 'worth its weight in gold' you are definatly a raw beginner in the Oracle world. I found NOTHING in this book that you cannot find in the Oracle documentation, for free!...There is nothing in this book on NT specific issues with Oracle except the install script that is the same on UNIX. This book is targeted at Oracle beginners and NOT people that know Oracle on other platforms and would like to know the ins and outs of Oracle on NT/Win2000...This is where a user will find the most problems, but this author never explains WHY you need services on NT, HOW they effect Oracle or how to manipulate them MANUALLY..."
4,The Change Handbook: The Definitive Resource on Today's Best Methods for Engaging Whole Systems,"A good support text for the change agent, consultant or practitioner. Over 60 different types of interventions with clear descrition for when and how to implement.The Change Handbook: The Definitive Resource on Today's Best Methods for Engaging Whole Systems"
3,GHOSTLY,"I enjoyed this one because it was fun listening to. It's a spooky, eerie, fun lullaby. If you want a fun scare then this is a good one."
1,Incompatible with 48-by-20 despite Amazon recommending it,"It was recommended as a purchase in tandem with the 48x20 mat. It came weeks before the mat, at which point we tried to figure out how it worked and have concluded it simply doesn't fit together in any way. Went on to return it, but since the adapter came weeks before the mat, the return window expired *yesterday*. Now I have a useless power adapter. Anybody want one?"
1,Makes the mat activate all the time,"Don't buy this. It makes the mat activate on its own every few seconds. The mat works fine with batteries, and although I'd much rather not waste batteries, this power adapter is no good. Amazon shouldn't be selling it. On the positive side, Amazon is paying for shipping on my return."
2,Didn't really help much,I bought about 5 of these since the price was so low and its hard for me to find ointment vs. creme. I guess sometimes you get what you pay for. This product didn't seem to help as much as I expected and the outer packaging actually faded into skin :( I don't recommend it.
5,The most hilarious CD you'll ever buy!,"I've always been a big fan of the Simpsons, but I never thought of buying the soundtrack until my friend Pete brainwashed me enough to go out and buy it. I'm telling you, it's the best TV soundtrack you'll ever buy! You'll wonder how you ever got through parties without dancing to Dr. Zaius and The Monorail Song! It's a great investment, whether you're a fan of the show, or any musical comedy whatsoever! Although, I can't think of another off the top of my head..."
2,Disappointing,"What a disappointment! This was the first Simpson CD I've ever purchased and it is terrible. I watch the Simpsons all the time and I know there are many many great songs on the show. But did they pick any of those great songs? No! It had way too much talking on it, and a couple different Simpson theme song paradies. The songs were short, I guess I was hoping they would elaborate on the songs a bit more. There were only two songs on it that were fun to sing along with. I based my CD choice on the reviews of this product and I don't know where those people were coming from, but this CD is not the one with all the good songs on it, so pick another one or build your own off itunes."
5,The best cd I have ever listened to!!!,"For ALL the Simpsons fans out there, this is the coolest, best cd ever made. I think that the producers should make another one!!! If you like Bart, Lisa, Maggy, Homer, and Marge this is the cd for you!! Theres also Apu Nahsepemapetalan Chief wiggum and many others.....I extremely advise you to listen and BUY this CD!!!! Its also the funniest yet!!"
2,Wimp Rock at its finest,"Bob Zoppi is obviously trying to be earnest in his heartfelt delivery. His semi-yodel makes the listener think he really means lyrics like ""You tend to alienate the only world that you come from."" This record is not challenging or thought-provoking at all. It is simply an effort to cash in on the recent success of bands like Semisonic, Vertical Horizon, or to a lesser extent, Matchbox Twenty. The songwriting is decent, but their lyrics belong in hair band power ballads of the 80s. Not an awesome CD, but if you are an avid fan of Vertical Horizon, you probably should give this one a try."
2,For the wealthy,"While so many of Europe's hotels have increased in price, Spain has remained 'a deal', until just recently. I thought from all of its glowing reviews that this book would offer some choices for those of us who do not want to spend $100+ a night. While there are a few deals, most of the listings were of no value to me. Friends who had gone to Spain had better recommendations. This book is for those with a high-median pocketbook, and who prefer a 'pedestrian' route in life. If that's you, perhaps you would like this book, but I did not."
5,"An enlightening, gentle Twilight view","An informative and delightful book, often admiring and invariably kindly in tone, yet with some clearly expressed, frankly critical opinions. The author himself is revealed to be the sort of person anyone who loves singing and singers would dearly wish to join in many hours of conversation, including maybe the occasional, but not rancorous difference of viewpoint.It is a wonderfully stimulating, entertaining and thoughtfully composed book, rich in fascinating insights and brightened by very humorous anecdotes. The twilight is not a bleak or gloomy time."
3,Jesus is cool,"Having been a fan since I saw the original on Broadway, this version rates very high. Jesus is sensational. Balsamo performs one of the best Gesthsemanes I have ever heard. Zubin Varla disappoints me as he sounds like he's an opera singer trying to perform rock. His voice grates on you after awhile. Joanna Ampil has a sweet voice but Yvonne Elliman is still my Mary of choice. The music is wonderful and I guess this version will have to do until a new Broadway 2000 addition appears."
4,"Great recording, but...","...it's been availible as an import from the UK since 1997. Until now, only the ""Highlights"" album has been availible in the US. Why did WE have to wait so long, Andrew? Nonetheless, this is a magnificent version of JCS, putting the original to shame. The only quarrel I have with it is that it changes some of the lyrics and drops ""Then We Are Decided"" and ""The Ressurection (Could We Start Again Please? reprise)"". Alice Cooper ROCKS as King Herod!"
4,Product was just as expected!,"I purchased Jesus Christ Superstar recently and the CD's are excellent quality. I am enjoying them as I write this - love all the songs. Great quality, great price."
2,It's Rock Opera Turned Musical Theatre..... Booooo,"If I'm not mistaken, Jesus Christ Superstar was first created in the 70's WITHOUT disgusting compression and artificial reverb on the drums and vocals. This is like Jesus Christ Superstar watered down for mainstream. It sounds way too overproduced. It has no soul. What I always liked about JCS is that it wasn't like all the other musicals. IF YOU WANT THE REAL THING, BUY THE ORIGINAL LONDON CONCEPT RECORDING."
4,Loves To Read,"I am a fan of this author. I like her fast pace, and suspenceful stories. If you haven't read any of her books now is the time to start!"
5,Great,"Sturdy, thick paper. Lead doesn't smear on it like some paper, and the reinforced pages are very useful for keeping my pages together in a beat up binder."
5,Great smell!,Bought this on line because we cannot find a local store selling it anymore. When I met my wife in 1971 this was the stuff she used. Now married 37 years and I still love the smell! Time to stock up???
4,Good smell - but texture a little funny,"No problems with the item, shipping, etc. However, even thought this product smells very good it does not have the same silky texture as most powders. It feels a little bit grainy. I don't think I would repurchase it again."
2,"Um, okay.","Pretentious and full of herself. Sounds so much like the talentless ""avant garde"" who do not have the discipline for classical training, but want to pronounce all others as inferior for failing to catch their ""vision"". I'll quote my son: ""Just shut up and make it pretty."""
3,weak unless very close,"OK if only 6-8 feet away, but otherwise don't bother. I still like it cause my laptop sound is very low and sometimes the nearby boombox has no input. Otherwise, I prefer audio advantage micro to hardwire sound into systems with built in amplifyer."
1,Don't waste your money,"My new receiver with a good antenna attached could not pick up a clean signal from the transmitter that was plugged into my computer that is only about 30 feet away. Signal had to travel through a wooden floor, but I expected more. The amount of static that is broadcast made the sound unacceptable."
2,Quality is just not there,"I am using the rocketFM to broadcast MP3 from my laptop to the tuner in the living room. Although the distance is about 10ft and there are no obstacles in between, there is some sort of interference mainly on high notes. I am not a quality freak and was just looking for something that would give a decent sound quality, but this is not it."
2,worst mxpx album,"This is their first album, and their worst. The recording is bad, and they get out of beat sometimes. Their new stuff is much better. Now you can tell they have grown up since they released this. Trust me, you could go without this one."
5,Buy this,"Yeah, the first time I heard mxpx was Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo, and I thought it was all right, but nothing to get all worked up over. I heard Life in General and Let it Happen a bunch of times, too, but never really felt like buying them. However, after listening to this cd, MxPx is THE coolest band ever. Sound like Rancid? No way, that's the Dingees. Like NOFX? No, that's Dogwood. They sound like MxPx, and it's raw and awesome. ""The Aspect,"" ""Time Brings Change,"" ""Anywhere But Here,"" ""Walking Bye,"" and ""No Room"" are amongst the best songs on here, and among the best in MxPx's surprisingly large repertoire. BUY IT NOW"
5,A great CD for lovers of folk and female rockers,"Rachel McCartney is a wonderful singer/songwriter from the Boston area. I had the pleasure of seeing her and purchasing this CD last summer. As comparisons go, which I hate to do because sometimes they miss, I'd compare her to Shawn Colvin, Ani DiFranco, Sarah Harmer and Bonnie Rait. Rachel is a true talent...a strong strummer on guitar with a booming, but sensitive voice. Sometimes bluesy, sometimes rocking, Rachel sings about relationships and dealing with thier peaks as well as their valleys. She sings openly about her beliefs and struggles. I would recommend this CD, but most of all, look for this artist to break out in the near future."
1,Introduction to C if You're a Dope...,I wouldn't recommend this book; the presentation is shallow as are the examples. Author assumes reader has little sense and the text is often goofy.
5,Great book,"Lots of information, great pictures. The book was solid, pages are tight. Nice purchase.Price was right for the item received."
2,Disappointing,"This book is built on an intriguing concept, but the result is disappointingly dull. Seems like if you've read one teenage girl's diary, you've read them all--this one included. It's filled with entries on how much she hates school, hates her mother, boyfriend drama...relatively little of the book deals with her depression and self-injury. It does contain a lot of artwork, which provide a welcome respite from the pages of mundane details, but overall this book just doesn't work."
1,the orchid hunter,"i have been disappointed in the last two books by landis. give us more of ""come spring"" and ""last chance"". Her last two books have been boring and over long. i feel like there are several ""books"" in each one and can't quite get into any one story line."
5,Very Creative,"Everdown plays very creative hard rock. Sounds sort of like Helmet, but more interesting. Fans of hardcore and Heavy metal would love this album"
2,Superficial but somewhat interesting,"The first section of the book that describes types of toxic people is interesting. The section that tells you how to deal with each type of toxic personality is also somewhat interesting, if incredibly obvious.The section that lists 'toxic faults' is ridiculous. One would have to be a perfect person, both in terms of looks and personality, in order to be found acceptable by the author. I understand that she focuses on outward appearances because of 'first impressions', but she takes it to such an extreme, I suspect she has some issues with her own looks."
1,"A comical book, actually!",As I was reading this book I came across some comical information. I thought I was just not understanding so I discussed it with my husband. He also agreed that some things written in this book were somewhat odd.It did not help me at all. The toxic people discribed were elementary. I put the book down and have never picked it up again.
1,Author is Poison to the Soul,Reader beware. She IS a toxic person. Her philosophies are not the kind of stuff you want to poison your mind or world with (was just off to review the one I bought -- Verbal Self-Defense). What a horrible person.
2,ok book,"I was looking forward to reading this book and was let down by it. I thought the character of ""Maya"" was completely unnessary and slowed things down. If her part was eliminated then there could have been more development of other characters.I would have liked to have found out what happened to Allison the psycho and to see if Deila ever got her raise. Not to mention, what happened with Alex and his degree.The plot that the girls have going is interesting and I find myself hoping that it will really work, then you get the bombshell about Marguarite (which is great) so you don't know how to cheer. And, the twist with Jane completely hit me by surprise! I would think the book would have moved faster if, like I said before, the character of Maya were eliminated. The author could have stretched out the ""plot"" against Jane a little more. It also would have been interesting to see what other things Deila dug up on people."
4,solid country with heart and soul,"Marty Stuart has deep roots in the kind of country music I used to hear. There's not much ""radio material"" for a single on this album and for that I am grateful. Marty isn't making music for top 40 country; he's giving you the history of country music every time he records a song and we reap the rewards with his latest effort. His showmanship on the mandolin shines on this CD and every feeling he can put forth into his music oozes out of your speakers. Sit back and be educated."
2,The album in which Jars of Clay officially abandons their roots and embraces generic Christian rock mediocrity,"Jars of Clay must have felt left out. There's a lot of really really mediocre Christian Rock Bands out there, and Jars of Clay escaped that for a long time...their first two albums are excellent, the next three above average, then Redemption songs was a return to excellence....and then they release this junk. Wow. It's as if they just flat out gave up on being creative. There are two good songs on this album - All My Tears and Oh My God. Everything else is bland, unoriginal, and exactly what Jars of Clay was NOT for the previous 10 years. I guess it's inevitable. The temptation to earn extra $$$ with less work on songwriting and performance can overcome God-given gifts and talents. Disappointing."
5,I can't stop listening to this!,"I love, love, love this cd! Its the first of their music I have purchased and oh so glad I did. I've been listening non stop in my car, enjoying the music and lyrics. Its hard for me to pick a favorite song, but Oh My God is powerful. Buy this one!!"
5,Excellent service; great quality,I was very pleased to receive the DVD sooner than what was told to me. The quality of DVD was great despite being used.
4,Clean family fun,"My older children, ages 9 and 6, enjoyed this movie and I was pleased that the content was clean. No swear words, no adult situations, no sexual situations. I would not suggest this for children younger than 6 because they might find some of the situations frightening."
1,Ben Stiller can't act.,"The movie would have been a lot better without Ben Stiller. Ben Stiller ruined the whole movie with his lame acting. He also does a lot of yelling and stumbling around. The movie is fun for 5 year olds but for adults it is pretty boring. Nobody cares about a dinosaur running around because we already saw that in a better movie called Jurassic Park. The movie would have been a lot better with a good actor like Will Ferral,Steve Carell,or Jim Carrey. Don't buy this movie just rent it at Blockbuster or somewhere."
1,Terrible Movie!!,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story is beyond ridiculous, and there are no laughs. I never thought I'd see so many actors that I like, in a movie I hated so much."
4,Genuine Comedies Still Exist,"Too many of the self-professing comedies coming out of Hollywood these days are unfunny rubbish and not worth the time of day, let alone the price of a DVD.'Night at the Museum' however is a rare treat.A guy down on his luck takes up a night watchman job at a museum where all the exhibits come to life at night. A very cool concept that should set the viewers up for a very entertaining movie. But does it actually work? Yes it does. Is it actually funny? Yes it is.A well written movie with excellent casting, acting, and dialogue. The special effects are very well done.There is a lot to like about this movie.A truckload of GENUINE laughs to be had here.Go grab the popcorn and enjoy."
3,"Started slow, finished slow...","Too many dropped logic chains, and slow action. Even the first night scenes dragged. The occassional scene was good, even emotional, but found myself paying more attention to my pizza and wine! Stiller did the best he could, but wasn't cast right. Robin Williams was great!"
3,Poor Sound Quality,"Why can't the recording industry come up with a standard sound level? The sound level on the DVD I got is so low that my new wide-screen TV, at full volumn, could be heard but not understood. In my case the purchase was a complete waste of money. I never got to see the whole movie due to the sound quality. Anything else I have watched the sound was acceptable. I'm very disappointed in this movie."
4,Family Freindly Comedy,"This ""family"" movie is one of the first in a long time that is actually a family friendly movie. Ben Stiller plays a down on his luck divorced father who has to find a job or else move away from his son. He stumbles across an understanding recruiter who gives him the job that no one else has been able to do, Night Watchman at the natural history museum. Little did he know he history really ""comes to life"" there. He also becomes a victim in plot that could threaten the whole museum. Plenty of laughs, decent action, something you can watch with ages 5 and above. Rent or buy this movie, it's worth it."
4,Enjoyable,This lighthearted tale speaks of faith and love of children and their father's and as an adult you need only look to your children to find the strength you need for each day. Good does triumph over evil and you will leave the theatre with a happy feeling.
2,A real disappointment,"""Night at the Museum"" has a great premise (and great promise) but it simply doesn't deliver. A lot of Hollywood energy was wasted on this film especially since Ben Stiller, a fine actor, has not much more to do than look scared and escape predators. It was particularly sad to see such stars as Dick Van Dyke and Mickey Rooney reduced to the little more than cameo roles they play. Robin Williams, however, is very good as Theodore Roosevelt.The film could have captured a wonderful innocence that reminded me of ""Home Alone 2"", this time with the protagonist as an adult/child rather than a young boy. ""Night at the Museum"" has some wonderful special effects but be warned that this film is not for very young viewers...the dinosaur scenes, especially near the beginning, can be truly frightening.""Night at the Museum"" tries hard but it never rings true."
5,GREAT family friendly movie,I bought this video because we're getting ready to go to NYC and visit the American Museum of Natural History. The movie turned out to be a pleasant surprise. It is a genuinely cute movie that my whole family loved.
3,Fun movie,"I'm going to the American Museum of Natural History later this month and wanted to see this in advance. It's a fun movie with a syrupy Hollywood ending, but was a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours."
3,Inter-history,"FWIW, we received this DVD in error but watched it anyway. I am over Ben Stiller. In everything he does he is the same oaf who manages to convince himself he's worthy. This film comprises no less. The Jumanji-like other reality is captivating and that interplay is amusing, if not the best feature of the film. The plot is predictable. Ricky Gervais is great, however. I don't think I would have been any more impressed with this film if I were 9."
5,A must for Charger Girls!,"Pretty much what you expect, haven't found any structural flaws or such, and it looks cute on my girlfriend, so all is well."
2,ITS OK,I HAD THIS HEATER IN MY PET SHOP AND IT DID WELL BUT THE PET SHOP IS IN A SWAP MEET AND NOT HEATED AT ALL.THE AREA IT WARMED UP WAS ONLY IF YOU STOOD RIGHT IN FRONT OF IT.MY SHOP IS ABOUT 300 SQ. FT. AND IT DID NOT EVER HEAT UP THAT WHOLE SPACE.
2,Not suitable for Explorist XL,"This item supports only Magellan Explorist models 500 and 600, I have bought it to support XL but it is very small.The description of the item was wrong"
5,Great general overview,"This book is a fantastic overview of the foundations of Usui System of Reiki. It is easily read, and covers the general principles. I highly reccommend this to anyone who wants to learn about Reiki's beginnings."
2,Martini should have used a pen name ...,"Acting on the quality of his other books, I purchased The List without so much as a glance at the rear cover. Motivated by the sunk cost of the purchase and the lingering taste of his better efforts, I stayed with it to the bitter end. The List is terrible. Overly dramatized characters and unlikely dialogue are ever-present distractions as Martini struggles to hold scene sketches together with baling wire. Attempting to disguise a future plot twist, he includes scenes which must later be forgotten if the reader is to accept the book's conclusion. I lost my 'impulse purchase' trust in Martini ... I'll most certainly read the dust jacket before investing in his next tale."
1,The ending ruins the story.,"The ending is improbable. It made me angry that I had wasted time reading this book. The first part of the book was pretty interesting, but the ending was contrived. In order to have an ending that wasn't obvious, we are given an ending that is not credible. I had read The Judge and liked it -- even though I thought its ending was a little contrived. This was much worse."
5,"Outrageous Price, but GREAT Paper!!!","Purchased this specifically for my 9yro son's Latin Binder. They keep a running binder for the entirety of the school year, and I've already spent too much time reinforcing the punched-holes. While I balked at the price, the reviews were good... so I tried it. I will hide it from the kids in terms of 'regular use', but it will be VERY welcome as intended, for the Latin Binder. VERY WELL REINFORCED PAPER!!! There is an actual plastic lining on the front and back of the margins, so it's VERY well reinforced. Highly recommended if you have a specific use such as a yearly Language or Subject binder for younger children in need of hard-to-find Wide Rule, but far too pricey for daily homework use."
2,Funny if you aren't already a mommy,"After reading the editorial review which stressed this was a book for ""birth and the years beyond"", about ""pregnancy and parenting"" I incorrectly assumed it would be a fun read for me as the mom of a two-year-old. Probably it would have been a great read before I had my baby, but once you've been through it you've pretty much figured out all this stuff yourself - even if it is much more cleverly and humorously expressed by the author."
1,Very Disappointing Book,"A lousy book that masquerades as a historical fiction, but is really just a vehicle for the author to espouse his religious beliefs."
2,Requires 6ft outlet clearance. Made in China. Arrived 1 early,"""Minimum Outlet Clearance: From normal combustible material"" is 6ft which requires a large open area to setup the heater. The high humidity created by all direct outlet propane heaters, mentioned in another review, is a big negative for machine tools. Not worth the money for MADE IN CHINA and do not expect good things from them. Even with free UPS supersaver shipping, it arrived in good condition one day before the start of the estimated delivery window. UPS tracking number was provided."
4,Body Glove,Product was well packaged and arrived in good condition. Fits very snuggly on the phone. Very pleased with the purchase.
5,Body glove Scuba II Cellsuit.,"The body Glove scuba II Cellsuits was an excellent purchase. It fits my cell perfectly, it is easy to put on, it does not block the camera."
3,Hard to Find Believable,"In similar fashion to other fem fight films, this one fails miserably!The acting leaves much to be desired as emotional subjects are discussed and delivered in a almost ""matter of fact"" way.This movie is so short on acting talent, the writers resort to a tried and true concept; making this movie little more than a T&A; contest. The resurrection of washed up ex-wrestlers/fighters (Bridgett Riley & Spice Williams) is almost comedic.The choreographed fight scenes are poorly edited both visually and audio. The editing is so bad in fact that the final fight scene takes place at night under poor lighting, obviously to hide the inability of the fight choreographer to make the fights seem even reasonably realistic. No blood after taking a beating in a bare knuckles fight?...Give me a break!I'm not sure what the total budget was for this flick, but given a few hundred thousand dollars I'm sure a high school student could do better."
2,One of the best emcees simply falls flat. what the.....,"Grouch is the best legends rapper and to me- second best rapper today(behind Canibus). we all know he can rip tracks apart with his heart-filled,emotional lyrics.This whole cd was a waste of studio time. poor production(only the second track was banging- really great!) expiremental? just like the ""love cd"" from outkast- too expiremental. He should stick to his usual simple production technique that we've all grown to appreciate. sometimes (honestly) barely.i hope Grouch doesn't see this as a diss directed towards him. we all know he gets down.save your money- buy grouch's other cd's. trust me- i made this mistake."
4,u must not like the grouch if you don't like this album,yes this ablum is very different from previous grouch stuff but it still kicks ass. whoever said that this album sucks is a dumbass and shouldn't be allowed to listen to grouch in the frist place. there are a lot of spmphony beats in this and a few of the tracks grouch raps them backwards. it takes a few listeinings to get used to but once you hear it a few times it will grow on you. This is one of my favorite Cd's and your grouch collection would not be complete without this.
2,For Die-Hard Fans Only,"Other reviews listed here at Amazon will give you the history of this CD, so I'll just give my opinion of the music/sound. I expected these remastered ""live"" and ""radio"" tapes to be rough, but these are really rough! The vocals are barely audible on all of the tracks, unfortunately. I saw the group open for Hendrix in Cincinnati in 1967 or 1968, and it was the first time I'd heard the Soft Machine's music. I was hooked; they sounded great. But the recordings here do not reflect what I remember at all. It's almost unlistenable to me, so I won't be pulling this CD out often. It's a ""for extreme collectors"" only, as far as I'm concerned. I was disappointed."
5,Important!,"Previously I had my airport on the floor in a surge protector. An accidental hit with a vaccum cleaner took it out. Now I'm glad to have the airport base next to my computer where I can keep my eyes on it and if I need to call to have something done on my computer, I'm not bending on the floor trying to restart my base."
5,Cant believe im the first review!?!,this cd is an amazing piece of work which represents a huge influence to a generation of upcomming bliss junkies still holding on to their twenties. wookie foot is the backbone of harvest fest (www.wookiefoot.com) which is the pinnacle of summer for those who attend. so get out of the jar and come join the fun
3,"James P. Hogan is no Tom Clancy, but...","Don't get me wrong, I've been a fan of Hogan ever since I bought an old, battered paperback of ""Inherit the Stars"" at a street- market bookstore in 1989. However, ""Endgame Enigma"" is not ""Inherit the Stars."" The science in the book is well thought-out, as always, but the plot is far too simplistic, and the spy-story theme just doesn't stand up to the rest of the genre. I will give kudos for the surprise ending, though. To simplify, if you are a fan of both sci-fi and political fiction novels, don't buy the book. However, for fans of sci-fi only, or especially James P. Hogan fans, buy the book as an introduction to the world of political intrigue. Then go pick up some Clancy."
3,endgame enigma,Good book...but....too much social interaction on the space station....I prefer more techincal action type of book.
3,with a slight lisp?,"Sister Wendy has a slight lisp with an English accent.There is no doubt that she has been to the places and seen thepaintings, but she has a sort of strange angle of attackon the female in art that she brings to herlectures? From cave are to 1400 A.D.she covers specific examples of Greek, Roman and Egyptian art.I liked the art and the color close-ups, but sometimes didn'tappreciate her interpretations."
3,Yeach,"The cover was very gruesome to lug around, I just hate covers with two people clinging arm to arm. Not only was the cover pitiful, but the story also. Everything was blunt in a bad way, nothing metaphoric and nothing with meaning. Just another hit and run book."
3,To be or not to be............,"This is certainly a good edition to the Night World Series. The story of Hannah and her different lives was interesting , however sometimes i found it dragged on alittle and couldnt wait for it to get to the good stuff. However still a thumbs up!!!!"
2,"the right book, the wrong edition","This is truly a wonderful series of art books, but unfortunately the Time Warner editions are mere shadows of the originals. The letters are interesting enough if you are already familiar with Degas and some of the circles that he inhabited, but if not it will be terribly disorientating. The reason most people will want to buy this book is for the abundant number of reproductions, but unfortunately this Time Warner edition is a very small book, with mainly post card sized illustrations. What is more, over a hundred pages (and therefore around a hundred illustrations) have been cropped to fit this smaller edition. By all means get the Little Brown Books edition!! It is out of print but still available through the Amazon marketplace or eBay. I was sorely disappointed with this version, expecting it to be twice as big and a hundred pages thicker."
5,Especially for young animal lovers,"Paul M. Howey's Freckles: The Mystery Of The Little White Dog In The Desert is a heartwarming true story about the love and comradeship offered by a dog and her puppies. The black-and-white illustrations of Judy Mehn Zabriskie adds an especially endearing touch of charm to the text story, which is sophisticated enough to appeal to young readers who are almost ready to move on from picturebooks to more complicated reading material. Freckles is highly recommended - especially for young animal lovers."
3,"nice light, if it lasts","i bought an identical unit at my local hardware store. recently two of the four bulbs stopped working. i popped it open to see what was going on. Each pair of lights has a small circuit board that presumably acts as a starter/ballast. Each board has a couple caps, resistors, diodes, and a single fuse (soldered to the board). I checked the continuity through the fuse on the faulty board and discovered it was blown. At that point, I bypassed the fuse entirely with an ammeter to make sure the simple fuse was the problem. To my dismay, the board starting popping and sizzling. The fuse had in fact done its job; it had burned out as the board had developed a short. At this point I'll probably just give up on it. At least half the light still works. Still a bit disappointing though, as it only functioned properly for maybe a year or so before half of it died."
4,great idea! Terrible design.,"The light works fine. The fact that it has two switches, four really bright lights, a mounting bracket, and a really long cord, are all a plus. But this is the third one I have had. And every one of them have the bulbs fall out of place. And they are really hard to get too, and most of the time, I couldn't get them to work again. So, I have been through three(3) of these things and like them, but they don't last."
5,New to punk,"I am not what you would call a punk expert, but I checked this out when a friend told me it was the BEST. I have to say it is full of energy. Don't buy it for some nice Sunday easy listening. This is HIGH octane base (bass [sic]) music."
5,putting guru,"putting guru of the world, has great tips for all skill levels, short game is the most important part of your game"
4,A bit much for the average golfer,"This book is the most technical resource on putting I have seen. With limited time to study, much less play, the game, it found it's way into my ""I'll get to it someday"" pile of reference books. Personally, I think his smaller work 'Putt like the Pros' has the majority of the meat of the subject without the extra baggage for the average golfer. Now, if your goal is to become the best golfer you can be, well, maybe you ought to read and head this excellent book. One star off for being a bit overwhelming for the average golfer."
3,Putting Bible,"Very techinical. While the information is good, Pelz is very ""wordey"" which makes reading an effort. He could have given the reader all the necessary instruction in a simpler format. Unless the golfer wants to invest in all the training aids suggested, Pelzs recomended putting stroke could have been explined in less than 50 pages."
5,This guy KNOWS putting,"I thought to myself ""How on earth could anyone write such a big book just on putting"" but after reading this book, I am amazed. This guy KNOWS putting. Its as if he's lived and breathed putting his entire life.The first 60% of the book give a detailed picture of what putting is, why people miss and make putts, what kinds of strokes work, al kinds of somewhat technical stuff. This guy is a scientist at heart, and it shows, but his book is an easy rood. He makes some absolutely astonishing observations like ""I bet you didnt know that you're doing ____, but it turns out that you are."" Sure enough, he's dead on right when you investigate for yourself, even though you had no idea beforehand.The second 40% of the book is about how to improve. It talks about how to practice and improve your stroke and green reading.This is a great book. If you want to learn a heck of a lot about being a better putter, look no further."
4,Very good quality,"This is a sturdy filter, with heavy gauge metal walls. I have always had good luck with K&N filter. They seem well engineered, and I love the exposed nut for easy removal"
3,Shorter would have been better,"This book would have been better with some serious editing. It was a 175 page story drawn out to fill 350 pages.The book started out fairly well. Interesting style of writing even though the premise was a tad thin. But then it got to be just too contrived with too many coincidences and episodes that were just not real. I mean, how many times could the sisters just happen to ""miss"" bumping into each other, on both sides of the Atlantic?The only reason I gave ""Grace and Favor"" as many as three stars was because I finished it. And I only finished it because I bought it. If it had been a library book, I would have stopped reading by page 100."
2,Dollar General A Better Choice,"Go to dollar general and buy their plastic spray bottles, I bought 3. They dont look pretty (keep them hidden) but they can spray and mist by turning the nozzle. If they gunk up (which they will) run them under hot water and presto ready to go again. Less that $4 bucks for the 3."
2,Pass on it,"I too bought this when it first hit Amazon. Mistake. Its drawbacks have been well cataloged by others, so I won't waste time repeating, but, if you're looking for a good mister, this ain't it."
4,welllll not to bad,"i purchased this sprayer to us with spray butter, well it does work but a full pump only get a small amount of spray probably because it is so thick but it still sprays better than the plastic bottle the butter comes with, it is easy to pump the bottle so i think it is worth the trouble to me hope this helps"
4,Salvaging a good 20 minutes of deathcore,"While I admit, there's nothing new, innovative or different about The Red Shore, they do make good music. They're talented musicians, good songwriters and this EP is a quick blast of heavy stuff. Some cool breakdowns, some intricate guitar riffs, great vocals, and powerful drumming. Don't go out of your way to get it, but buy/download it if it's available. Thanks for the time, and peace."
3,This a good dictionary for the beginner.,"I enjoy this book. It presents things clearly. It illustrates with pictures, and gives many synonyms. I like it because it is 2-in-1. It translates words from English-to-French, or French-English. I highly recommend this book for a French beginner."
1,"parts missing, sized incorrectly","Despite carefully checking the specs before I ordered it, the product was not sized correctly. It was also missing several pieces, most importantly, one of the metal rods was missing along with several other small pieces for the bottom. Amazon is a great place to shop but I was very disappointed with this purchase and will not order auto parts like this online again. Amazon accepted the return of the product and refunded our money."
1,Polaris POS,"Replaced Polaris with Viper 2 years ago. It's been in the shop 4 times. The last time it was in, Leslie Pool charged me for replacing the manifold. Got it home and it was doing the same thing! Took it back and they said...Opps! we forgot to replace the manifold! They finally replaced it, still stops when it wants to, constantly gets tangled up, stays either on the deep side or the shallow side of the pool just for giggles etc.I'd never buy a Viper again. It's a P.O.S."
2,Annoyances,"Starting off with a particularly bad start in the US, Kylie Minogue is finally making an impression on American music fans. Unfortunately, her single, Can't Get You Out of My Head, is too repetitive and annoyingly whiny to make any impressions on me. The song starts off with a nice, techno-ish beat, but then moves on to an increasingly irritating 'La, la, la, la, la"". She continues to whine ""I just can't get you out of my head, boy your love is all I think about"" twice, and then Lalala's again. After doing ANOTHER ""I just can't get you out of my head, boy your love is all I think about"", she finally gets to the actual song. Not much better. I have to strain to comprehend anything she says, and her breathy vocals don't make it any easier for me. If her album is anything like this single, I seriously don't recommend buying either."
1,Empty pop fluff,A lot of people have heard this piece of pop trash already. Kylie Minogue has once again released the most boring pop track of the year. This song has lyrics a four year old could write!This year Minogue is even more desperate to get a hit single. She needs Cathy Dennis to write her pop songs.Kylie. WE'RE LAUGHING AT YOU! Please stop embarrassing yourself and gracefully retire.
1,UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T GET THIS SONG OUT OF MY HEAD,"I AM SICK OF HEARING THIS ON EVERY RADIO STATION I LISTEN TO. IT WAS ON TWO RADIO STATIONS AT ONE TIME. SHE IS NOT THE MADONNA OF EUROPE SHE SUCKS. THEY CAN PUT HER ON EVERY RADIO STATION JUST ABOUT BUT THEY CAN'T PUT MARIAH CAREY ON ANY RADIO STATIONS. IF YOU WANT A REAL PARTY CD GO BUY J LO'S REMIX ALBUM, BUT IF YOU UPBEAT AND BEAUTIFUL BALLADS YOU SHOULD BUY RAINBOW OR THE LOVERBOY SINGLE, BUT PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM CHRISTINA AGUILERA SHE IS EVEN WORST THAN KYLIE."
5,Dream Theater at Radio City Music Hall,"Great concert - great music. If you love Dream Theater, you'll love this one. Backstage footage is excellent - Old footage from the beginning of Dream Theater (when they were still Majesty). A must for any Dream Theater fan."
5,Absolutely Glorious,"For all true Dream Theater fans, this is a must have DVD! The only drawback to ""Score"" that I found was that they didn't play ""Never Enough"", but that shouldn't prevent you from purchasing ""Score"". I have watched the DVD over 10 times already and it hasn't gotten old for me..."
2,Nice. Until it rots.,"I was initially pleased with the product, but made the mistake of leaving the bottle in my car on a hot day. Within a couple hours, my nice smelling white lotion turned brown and smelly. I'm now afraid to use it and so am wasting a nearly new bottle."
1,Poor quality cord light,"I purchased one of these in the 40' length and after only 2 years of light duty in my home garage it's rewind mechanism broke. This was supposed to be a heavy duty model reel. So I call the manufacturer and they say send it back and they will fix it. I pay the postage to mail it back to the manufacturer and after a while they send it back to me supposedly repaired but guess what, the locking mechanism for the reel is not working so the cord is always trying to rewind. Cheap plastic mechanism. I will not buy another one of these. I have a 30' electricord reel that has worked flawlessly for many years."
4,Works Good,"Helped to de-clutter my garage. Always know the extension cord neat, tidy and untangled. Mounted it under the workbench.Sometimes the lock position is hard to find."
4,It coulda been a contenda...,"I got my introduction to Zander and his Philharmonia series backwards, starting with his wonderful 5th. Remarkable about that recording was the poise and electricity permeating this meaty work - one, where it's all too easy to lose one's way or devolve into histrionics. Zinman's First, unfortunately, lacks the artistry of his 5th (and 4th, too). Listening to his commentary on the piece (disc 2), one wonders how the insight he articulated evaporated in the execution. Technically proficient (kudos to the Phil), this performance is damned to be, alas, rather ordinary. Excellent sonics."
4,I enjoyed this video very much!,"If you like Science Fiction, you'll really like this one. What is the Airzone Solution? It is a solution to a problem. The dialog at the end is really quite convincing. It sounds like a good solution to a problem. It is a lesson in politics, something that will make you think. If you like Science Fiction shows like Doctor Who, Twilight Zone, and Outer Limits, this one will take you somewhere similar. It is especially good if you are a Doctor Who Fan because Colin Baker and Nicola Bryant do an outstanding job, and there role together is quite different than that of Doctor Who. It demonstrates how good these actors really are, in something different and interesting. After viewing this video, I continued to think about it long after. Something like this could really happen. This video demonstrates how easy it is for all of us to be taken in by convincing words, instead of investigating the facts."
4,Don't look any further!,"If you are already using a Pioneer head unit, CDX-P1280 can complement your head unit with more capacity to play your favorite CDs without changing them frequently. I am using P1280 for four years now, earlier used it with Pioneer KEH P 7250 (Discontinued), and now with Pioneer P-80MP. This CD Changer unit is a fit it, forget it kind of unit. No repairs required, in fact never cleaned the lens unit in four years. It can mounted vertically and horizontally. It also has a 100 Discs memory, so if you are like me who feeds the title of the disk, it will make your life simpler. If you are looking for a perfect CD changer, this is the right thing to go for. Avoid using the FM modulated changers, as the quality is not even close to direct bus models."
3,CD PLAYER FOR CARS ONLY?,Hi - not sure how to ask questions on this player... is this CD player only for Cars? I want one for my home stereo.... Thanks !
5,One of the best.....,"After reading Denise's book, I've applied many of the wonderful self loving points as part of a daily recovery system. I can now put to rest the time I've spend searching for just the right book to help put me in a world where I could ""tame my chew"". I highly recommend this to anyone who has struggled with or knows someone with an eating disorder, or similiar tendencies. Denise has done an extremely wonderful job of putting things in perspective."
4,The Taming of the Chew,"After reading this book, I find that it hits close to the truth. What I like about this book is that it offers other books that delve further into specific issues. I find that it answers basic questions and allows for the reader to pick their specific issues and which books that may help the reader on that journey. Which is important because if this book held all of that information, it would be too large and readers would be daunted by that fact to even read it."
5,Just as remembered (almost),"Loved this series as an 9 year old when it came out. Used to stay up late to watch the ""creepy"" Hammer House Of Horror show and this set is as remembered. One thing I noticed missing was when I was a young lad and watched the series it was always introduced with an actual beating heart that after some time went into asystole. This DVD set does not have the intro I remember but the episodes are all there and well done for the era. The British certainly know how to make your skin crawl in this series. Great Stuff"
3,Decent but not riveting,Good enough for a series worth the purchase if you are a Hammer fan. Reminds me of other series like Night Gallery.
4,Pendragon VS Odysseus,"This book is part of the Grailquest series, and it's a roleplaying game were the reader is supposed to be the hero. In each of the books of the series, you're playing the role of a young adventurer whose name is Pip, saving King Arthur's kingdom. In this specific adventure, you must prevent a Saxon invasion, but Merlin somehow missed a spell and you find yourself trapped in the Greek mythic ages... Weird, isn't it? Well, J.H. Brennan vision of the round table is a twisted and amusing one, somewhere between the original round table legends and Monty Python's Holy Grail, which makes this book (and all the others in the Grailquest series) very enjoyable. I discovered Voyage of Terror when I was 10 (I'm now 24) but I think it's still worth the read, especialy if you like fantasy and Terry Pratchett's sense of humor."
2,No handle or wheels.,Mr. Heater F270800 heater picture has handle and wheels. My Mr. Heater came with no handle or wheels. you can not move around when hot.
2,Damned thing is right.,"This installment of the MOH series, I did not like at all. The story was interesting - I'll give it that (father ruins land for oil... then dies pretty gruesomely which is cool) and then his son is haunted by the memory of that night for 28 years... until the thing that killed his father comes back and ruins the town. I swear I've seen this before... or something like it.So... throughout the ENTIRE movie... you are waiting to see a picture, a glimse of the damned thing (I love saying that!)... and you get too... at the VERY end for 3 seconds and its bad, really, really bad!So my advice to you is... skip this one, if you are a fan of Hooper and want to take a chance, go ahead... just dont say that you were not warned.Oh yeah... Ted Raimi is in this one too... so, so performance. Liked him better as the comedic relief in spider-man... or as ""Henrietta - the evil cellar witch"" in Evil Dead II"
1,Damn the damned thing,"OMG i didnt know what to make of this. It started great then everything went the wrong way.To cut the story short, DONT WATCH THIS MOVIE its a waste of time."
2,Evaluation of the 1997 printing of Classical Mechanics,"I am sorry to find the inconsistency in quality of material covered in this book. With the use of MathCad incorporated in an attempt to simplify calculations and make function plots more vissible, the user friendly outline of the book has been marred considerably. However, above and beyond these minor infractions, is the inoordinate and quite unacceptable number of typographical errors. While some of these are insignificant, there are those that prove detrimental to the reliability of the book. Examples of these can laboriously be discovered after much attempt of various ""prove"" problems in the end of the chapter assignments. This is a very poor reflection of the true ability of Mr. Arya."
1,THE WORST BOOK IN THE HISTORY OF TIME,"I'm a college student taking a mechanics class and we are using this ""book"", and I use that term lightly. Throughout the book there are no explanations as to what is going on and the exercises at the end of each section rarely have anything to do with the section. The author seems to expect you to be able to read his mind as you read the book since it is mostly full of equations rather then words. Also, a large number of the equations are incorrect which is unacceptable in a physics book. Anyways, do not buy this book at all costs...if you see this book in your path, you run, you run away as fast as your legs can take you. I'm sure there are many good books on mechanics, but this is definitely not one of them."
4,Beware The Bus,"I have never understood the chapbook industry. Paying a lot for a single short story just doesn't seem right. But, when I can find one used for a decent price, I might check it out.This creepy little tale takes place on a bus going to the Valley on twisting mountain roads. Right from the start we know something is wrong. The driver is strange. He tries to keep the narrator off the bus.As the story progresses you think you know where it is going but you would only be partially right. The tension builds nicely and wraps up in a satisfactory manner with a twist and an explanation.I wouldn't recommend paying a lot for this one but it is worth reading."
4,YUM!,"Great bar, very filling and natural - definite bonus! Would be 5 stars if the sugar content was a tad lower."
5,Great Tasting,"I have tried many protein bars, but this one is just great tasting. It tastes like a candy bar but without all the crap. I eat one every morning and now so does my 5 year old. She tried it once thinking it was chocolate and after that she was hooked. I protein bar so tasty that even a 5 year old loves it. Its become a treat for her. She finishes a whole bar in a day. Which is great for her, 20 gm of protein for a 40 lb kid :). I havent seen any side effects or anything abnormal. It gives me a good boost in the morning especially when you are lacking sugars and your body has been fasting for 8 hrs+, you need a quick boost to get some sugars and protein in your body. This is perfect for the mornings. But like any protein bar, you need something to drink with it. Water works for me."
2,Excess sugar,"Yes these taste good, but that's not a surprise, there's a whopping 30g of sugar in each bar (the main reason bars don't taste good is because they are low on net carbs). Pretty sure even junk food candy bars have less sugar than that. These are NOT protein bars, they're energy bars. If you're going mountain climbing or something and plan to burn that 30g of sugar in 1-2 hours, than these would be a nice snack. Otherwise it's just way too much sugar to eat at once. A normal person only needs 100g of sugar a day, and only 40% of that should be from unnatural sources (not from fruits, veggies, milk, etc). This almost fills up your daily quota in one serving. Insulin spike, anyone?The excess amount of sugar is also why these are so cheap. It's costly to produce a high quality protein bar that's low in net carbs. On the other hand, these are just packed with sugar to overpower any other flavors."
3,"Tasty from the grocery store, but....","I first got these lemon-y bars at my local grocery store and thought them very delicious-as protein bars go, so I decided to order them in bulk from Amazon. Big mistake to order them in south Texas in September. They arrived with the coating completely melted, and tasted horrible. I just threw away $50 worth of protein bars because they were inedible."
5,Our Holiday Penguin,Who doesn't love Berkeley Breathed or even more so... Opus! This is a 'must have' holiday story.
2,Too much hype,I got half way through and had to stop wasting my time on this one. I have no desire to open the cover on book 3 of this series. I did read the Virgin River trilogy and thought they were all very good. Maybe close friends of R. Carr are being nice are leaving the 5 star reviews.
4,Grace valley,This SERIES is really enjoyable and sucks you right in. Sorry to see this is the last book so far. Wood love to keep reading.
5,Down by the River,I can't put Robyn Carr's books down. I'm not even watching TV. I have to make myself go to bed because I would rather be reading than sleeping. Not complicated but a good story line to keep you wanting to know what happens next.Pat
3,Petrushevskaya has done better,"Reading Ludmila Petrushevskaya is like snooping around the darkest corners of one's own soul. She mixes the day-to-day reality with urban legends, religious mysticism, dreams, ghosts, you name it. And she is usually really good at it--in this book, however, she sticks with reality, and, I think, shortchanges the reader.This is a good book, of course. You cannot help sympathizing with the narrator-mother and feeling furious about the irresponsible slut of a daughter (though AA does begin to annoy you with her moralizing as she is reading the daughter's diaries, adding offensive comments along the way about her daughter's sex life). The choice AA must make in the end (and the futility of it) is the perfect finish to this very dark, depressing, at times heart-wrenching book. This book, however, is nowhere as good as some of Petrushevskaya's terrifying short stories."
4,Innovative. Soul searching. Sincere.,"Luxury has accomplished with ease what most ""christian"" bands struggle to do. They have created music that speaks of their faith, without pop culture cliches and recycled imagery. Their music is delicate and precise; explosive and hypnotic. Somebody better get behind these guys and encourage them to make some more waves."
5,Don't miss this experience,Fred Hammond possess an annointing which transcends all gospel music. He speaks of daily circumstances and challenges with a most accurate turn of phrase while encouraging listeners to focus on God's phenomenal greatness. I have personally used this album to help me through some of the most challenging times in my life. I am greatful to Mr. Hammond and his gift.
3,Griffin iPod AirCLick Remote,"easy to use, goes thru walls unlike infraredsometimes when you press a button it does not register, does not fit onto iPod when protective case is ongood product all in all"
1,Will NOT work on iPod w/o another piece of equipment!!!,"While the label says ""...Remote Control for iPod or iPod mini..."", the fine print on the INSIDE says you ALSO need a ""dock connector (not included)"". WTF? I buy a product, then find out I needed something more? Hard to believe that Amazon allows such craziness. Too late to get my $$$ back or I would've already returned it. Good grief already."
1,Not clear on compatibility,"The description is rather vague as to which iPod models and generations this device will actually work with. I think this was designed back when the iPod was just *an iPod* - no nano, no shuffle, no touch, none of those.People have come to expect interchangeability between products and this is obviously a throwback to a former era. Unfortunately, the packaging and information doesn't make that clear at all."
4,"Great Audio, Fair Video","The kings of circus-metal do it again, the sound quality is great for a live CDthe video is fair, considering they used 3 or 4 cameras you would think it would be better. The club was small and a little dark, The ""day in the life of D.F.D."" was o.k., some of it was funny, some was sad, They were such a great band, it's a shame they never made it to that next level. They also don't put all the songs from the CD on the DVD (""9-5 at the morgue"" being one of them,one of my favorites). also they released this before ""Adultery"", so you won't hear any of those songs on it.To sum it up, If you like D.F.D. It's a must have (I paid $7 for the set, I would have paid more!)"
4,Computer Remote,Hi! Twenty words is sometimes hard to use in the days of twitter! The product was exactly what was promised. It arrive quickly and well packed. So sad these are not being made anymore! Great for the classroom! Thanks!!
1,made MISTAKE buying this!,"I like the compact design, but it just doesn't work well. This remote has an annoying habit of jumping to the end of a power point show, instead of advancing one slide. This is off-putting to an audience and cumbersome for a presenter. Ugh. I just ordered the Kensington remote to replace this one. Also note: for Mac users, this remote only works with MS Office 2004, not earlier versions of the software."
2,Another Band that thought..,Another band that thought ripping off a really bad copy of the cover art was better than perhaps paying something to the artist and getting a good looking cover. This is how that image should look: [...]
3,Good for teaching,"I ordered this book as a tool for supervising students. It's been a challenge putting into words the work I do everyday as I do it without thinking about it, and this book helped me organize skills that I wanted to pass along to the students I supervise. For example, the book had sections on contracting, engaging, and ethics, all skills I use everyday but sometimes overlook that these are skills that must be taught. I found the book helpful although I wish I found a cheaper copy, not sure it's worth $75"
3,Its a required book.,This book was required reading for Social Work class. Not something I would buy for a pleasure read. It has some great information for beginning social work students. The examples and exercise are helpful.
1,Great Book,"Geraldine make the 1993 allegation fall into place so th ereader can see the story for what it was, extortion.I recommend anyone who wants to know the truth to read this book."
5,REDEMPTION by Geraldine Hughes,I am sooo glad I read this book. Geraldine did a wonderful job telling what REALLY went on behind the scenes and how Michael was framed!! I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know the truth about what really happened in 1993!!!!
5,Guided meditations,"I have been on my own trek of spirituality with the practice of daily meditation. Shakti Gawain's CD is fantastic for those starting out to get the feel of meditation and her calming voice helps guide your thoughts and gets you in motion to experience rest, relaxation and the law of attration. I highly recommend this CD!"
3,Sleep inducing,"It really would be great if I could stay awake through Gawain's guided meditation. As a matter of fact, I meditated so deeply the one time that I stayed awake. However I must say to all you insomaniacs, this here is the sleeping aid for you. Hey look at it this way, if you stay awake through the whole CD at least you will feel deeply refreshed. No,I don't recommend this one for meditating. I am not one to fall asleep readily, but this one puts me to sleep!"
5,The Black Pearl,"The Black Pearl is a very interesting and suspenseful book. In it there is a boy named Ramón Salazar. He learns how to be a pearler and identify pearls. In his village all the villagers believe that they have seen the great beast the Manta Diablo. (If you read this book you will learn more about it.) An old man knew what cave the Manta Diablo lived in but dared not go in it. One day Ramón goes into the cave to dive for pearls. What will happen next? Read the book to see. I think this book is not as good as Island of the Blue Dolphins, which was also written by Scott O'Dell, but it is more suspenseful."
4,Solid tracks,"The Starflyer 2000 reprise is so beautiful. The guitar towards the end is has the perfect sound. Think ""Help me when your gone"" type of song."
1,Blackjack For The First Century,"One usually assumes that if a person has written a book, he or she must have a modicum of knowledge about the subject being written about; but this book proves the fallacy of such an assumption. John Patrick is totally clueless concerning the mathematical probabilities which govern this game.All games that are offered by a Casino have a built-in advantage, but seldom will you find an author suggesting that you play in a way that will increase the Casino's advantage over you. This is the only thing that John Patrick does correctly. Every one of his ""special"" ideas about how to play this game are WRONG.If you play Blackjack the way he tells you to, you will not only throw away the money you spent to buy this book, you will also throw away the money you wager in a Casino using his ""special"" strategy. My only regret is that I had to choose a rating system from 1 to 5. If I could, I would have chosen -50."
4,A very well done book about plains indians,I really enjoyed this book. I thought that it was a lot of fun and full of heartfelt emotion. Shame on those who criticize the authors writing style as being too simplistic-it's his first book for crying out loud! His sentences were to the point and made for quick reading.Worth the read to anyone who enjoyed to film or has an interest in the plains indians.
3,"Good, but no swivel","Case is pretty good quality- the zipper is better than others with velcro closure. I did not realize that it came with non-swivel clip. I ended up ordering the swivel clip separately, doubling shipping costs."
3,Not as good as it should be,"An early Doc Savage, with a title like this and a cover depicting a giant hand rising from the water to snare Doc should be among the best of his adventires. Unfortunately, I find it a bit tame and don't think it lives up to expectations. The monsters are never really menacing. The chief villain is as obvious as it gets. All in all, a minor disappointment."
1,Wordy and Out dated!,"As a beginer to understnading electronics, this was the first book that I picked up and read the first 5 pages of. From there it was just OK! This book was first published in 1966. The book is VERY wordy, and the author LOVES to use comas. I <b>DONT</b> recomend this book to anyone. As a matter of fact, if you see it in your local libray tell them to take it out of circulation"
4,Came a Spider,The novel Came A Spider by Edward Levy was a very good book. It was full of suspense . It was almost like a horror movie. I think this book was very well written there was a lot of detail.The first chapter kept you interested. In the first chapter there is already a mystery to be solved and in order to figure it out you have to keep reading. The plot was very strong it was built at a good pace.One of the things that I really liked about the book was the characters. The characters were very realistic. It was very easy to relate to them because you got to look into their personal lives.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense and mystery. Came A Spider is a very well written book that I'm sure you will enjoy.
1,Very Poor - Caution Advised,"Never the greatest of performers, Patti has once again come up with an album of incoherent ramblings. Poor Patti still takes herself too seriously causing her to be ridiculed by her peers, still stuck in the Bowery circa 1974. Unlike other artists of the mid Seventies CBGB's era who managed to escape from New York and dominate the charts world-wide, Patti will always sadly remain a novelty attraction."
4,"Satisfied, but still a little annoyed..","The vinyl arrived in a timely fashion and had a polite ""thank you"" scrawled on the receipt. However, the record, which was advertised as ""new"" had a few scratches on the second side. I can live with it since there are a lot of hisses and pops imbued in this particular recording due to the lo-fi aesthetic of the artist, but it would have been nice to know that my ""new"" vinyl was actually used. Shrink wrapping a used record does not make it new!!"
3,The Art of Jugling,"A previous reviewer has stated that this book is in ""pretty dense Middle English."" Not so. It's just in a very old form of what might best be termed, ""Early Modern English."" The typography makes this more difficult for the modern reader than anything else. The long ""s"" that looks like ""f"" confuses the modern reader. However, with a bit of endurance, and some determination, the book can be read and understood.It is more of a curiosity than anything else. If you want to learn juggling, get ""Juggling for the Complete Klutz."""
1,THIS ISN'T WHAT I ORDERED!!,"I ordered: Olive Drab Canvas Sewing Kit - Tri-Fold. Mesh Pocket. Includes Scissors, Thread, Buttons, Needles & Pins. What I got is: 3.39 G.I. Style Sewing Kit. Is a nylon pouch with a plastic thimble, scissors that don't open up enough to cut anything but a single thread, six miniature spools of thread in white, black & shades of grey, an ity-bity plastic box with a paper measuring tape, several buttons, 3 needles, 2 safety pins, half a dozen snaps & a fastener. Purchased for my teenage Boy Scout so I wanted something durable. Also wanted the trifold canvas kit because that's what his Grandpa's WWII Army issue sewing kit is. I'm pretty disappointed that I received a completely different product, and the quality of some of the items it contains. The pouch appears durable enough, as long as the snap holds up he'll be ok using it with a few different items I'll add to it."
3,You Only Need One,"I own a bunch of Elizabeth George's books that are available here and on christian books, even 1 written by both Elizabeth and her husband Jim.Sorry to say, but in my opinion, once you have one of her books, you have all of her books.They all pretty much say the same thing, just re organized in each book.So if this is your first Elizabeth George Book, great! I think you'll enjoy it. But if you are considering purchasing this book as a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc-I wouldn't because you've already got the book pretty much in your first E. George book."
5,Belly Fat Cure,"This product is ""Belly Fat Cure"" approved by Jorge Cruise. I used the product to make the brownie recipe in the book 'The Belly Fat Cure'. Best brownies I have ever had!!"
5,great darts,really like this dart and the kit has every thing you need to get started minus the board.
5,A MAGNIFICENT BOOK!!!!!!,"This is one of the finest books I have ever read!!! I have read thousands of books too, many great ones. The vocabulary is one of the most complex that I have ever encountered... I loved it! The story is clever and heart warming! If you are a real and inellectual reader you will love this book!"
2,"Oh Dear, skip over this one",This is horrible; I actually think the positive reviewers are fooling themselves if they can understand this elitist drivel. Yuck
3,I wanted to love this book.....but,"One of the e-mail discussion lists I'm on recently had a thread about children's books and sled dogs and this was one of the books on the list. I ordered a pile of books and started reading. I loved most....this one fell short. It starts off fine, but the ending gives children unrealistic ideas about what happens when dogs get old. If the author had made it obvious that the end was a dream-sequence....not reality, this would have worked. But to leave the impression that an old sled dog has reached the point where they can only walk with difficulty can suddenly become the lead dog in a team and plead to go off with a musher and his team rather than stay with the child and resolve the issue of Zoe's health/life....well, you decide.I DO recommend 'Kiana's Iditarod' and 'Akiak : A Tale from the Iditarod' neither of which deal with elderly dog issues but are great stories for children."
4,"A collection that is definitely ""Definitive""","I love this CD. The only real glaring omission is ""Don't Want to Lose You"" from the ""comeback"" of 1996's ""Louder than Words"" album. Perhaps the Iglesias-Richie duet ""To Love a Woman"" could have been replaced with that song. Other than that, no complaints. If you have any (or, like me, all) of Richie's solo discs, you'll still want to keep them. They contain some unreleased gems that you won't find here but this a smart investment and will make an impressive addition to your collection."
3,"Good, but missing some important songs.","This is a decent primer for the casual Lionel Richie fan, but it falls short of the title ""Definitive"". In typical fashion, we get a Greatest Hits package missing some key hits. Why do they ALWAYS have to do this? I had been waiting forever for a truly ""definitive"" Lionel Richie hits package to emerge, and when it finally does...well I guess I'll just have to make my own. Where are ""My Love"" (#5), ""Love Will Conquer All"" (#9), ""Se La"" (#20), and ""Lady"" (a #1 for Kenny Rogers and a critical step in Lionel's evolution as a solo artist)? And since they're culling hits from his work with the Commodores, how about ""Nightshift"" (#3), which unlike the others, at least came out during Lionel's solo years? I think a couple of the Commodores singles, ""Angel"", or either of the two bonus tracks could have been nixed to make more room for the missing 4 hits. Then it could deservedly be called the ""definitive collection""."
4,Powerful and Comforting Verses,"My Christian friend Craig Sather lent me this book in early 2005, and I found many of the words very comforting.From Proverbs 28:27""Give to the poor and your will never be in need. If you close your eyes to teh poor, many people will curse you."" that kind of sums up what the book is all about.From John 3:18""My children, our love should not just be words and talk; it must be true love, which shows itself in action.""Thanks Craig for your spiritual thoughtfulness."
1,"Creepy, as you might expect",I read this book in the library. I found it to be the usual bigotry masked as Christianity. There is no balanced look at the issue and gay people are dealt with in what I think of as a distinctly un-Christian way that does not look at their essential humanity but only as abstract faulty products. If you want more right wing fake religiousity then read it. If you'd like to really understand the issue get out in the commmunity and meet divorced people and gay people and try to figure out the real problems with marriage in our society.
2,The Quest?,"Why was ""The Quest"" left off this CD? Are you kidding me? ""The Quest"" was David's best work! Someone dropped the ball here!"
2,Disappointed,"Two or three great songs that you don't hear too much (Pixies, Rembrandts), but some of the other selections have already been beat to death by radio."
4,Helping Hand,"This book was a wonder for me. It really showed me what to do when a certain crisis strickes. It also told me how to react. Overall, it made some things much clearer for me."
4,yummy!,"all i can say is that this is a very cool cd. but, most people won't understand it because it's ahead of it's time. it's very hip!"
3,Not the CD I would get from them.....,"....if I was just getting one. Tower Recordings are a fantastic, authentically psychedelic band from New York, but this album does not have a great sense of continuity/flow, and it's only 37 minutes. Some tracks have the magic, but mostly it's kind of a mess - disjointed and so-so. (The second half is better in this respect than the first, but then the latter tracks are mostly a minute or less.) Earlier albums were more abstract and seemed more inspired, too. I would HIGHLY recommend ""Furniture Music For Evening Shuttles"" over this. Sometimes one instrument/sound is rambling on when you wish there were more group interplay. There's some nice, intuitive, f*@ked up moments....but they can do better than this."
1,displeased,i ordered this product a while back and come to find out it to small for most wider laptops. so if your one of many out there with a not so compact laptop i wouldnt recomend this one. i own a sony laptop and the case is just barely to small. other than that its a good choice
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST LITTLE STORIES EVER TOLD!,"Mark Fisher has written a real gem. The story is perfect and extemely empowering. I do think that for some, however, it may require a ""leap of faith"" so to speak. Some of the more ""rational"" types may need to read the Seth books by Jane Roberts in order to get the more technical aspects of how we each create our own reality. I loved the book and thank Mark Fisher for giving it to us."
5,It helped to open my mind about abundance,"I was immediately engrossed when I first read this book about eight years ago, especially because the prime character's career and salary were very similar to mine, and the way he felt about his position (How did I get here? How do I get out?) was identical to how I felt. Opportunities for abundant thinking are presented in this roller coaster ride of a fable, bound to shake up the gravitational forces that keep one out of the flow...of life, money, love! It's a refreshing perspective and can really get things moving when its simple principles are applied to one's life. It's worth reading over and over again, at different points along the curve."
3,Only an okay CD...,"Many of the songs on this CD are too raw...not refined enough like what you'd get if you bought their best album, ""Life in General"". There are some likeable songs on here such as Punk Rawk Show, Moneytree & Teenage Politics. Some of the songs are just plain noise, though. If you really like MXPX, get it."
3,pretty good,"I like this cd, and this band, even though I'm not into a lot of Christian music. They're not preachy (NO offense meant to ANYONE in that comment). This is good to listen to for fast punk rock to go crazy to. Punk Rawk Show is the best. It's only 3 stars because not all the songs on here are that good. But overall I like it."
4,a good cd,"Note that i just say good. It is a good cd reely, but you cant listen to it to many times. trust me. Ive listened to it way to much and now i just dont want to listen to it anymore. although rainyday, like the sands thru the hourglass..., different things, and americanism are all good songs. by the way the hidden track is Delores."
1,Live at Sunrise,"A WASTE of time and money. This guy is still trying to write & sing songs. He should have just taken a job flipping burgers.Is this what happens to musical artists that get old and loose touch with the real world?I have listened to the whole CD and really disgusted with his album. I threw it in the garbage, and will never buy any more ofhis music ever again.HIS MUSIC IS A JOKE on CONSUMERS.Thank you,"
4,"A little, little disappointed.","This is the 3rd copy of this CD that I have ordered as I gave them for gifts. However, this one has a couple of different songs on it and is not like the first two ordered. I will keep it as it is for a gift."
4,A great book for 1st year anatomy,"This book is excellent as an overview of regional anatomy for the first time you are learning something. It is so systematic, and gives you a sense of what is important, what is detail, and what the big picture is. It is also great as a review book just before exams. One downside, though, is that it is sprinkled with major errors which can all be attributed to typos. The good far outweighs the bad in this book, but don't use it as the final word."
3,"Some good tales, some not so great","This collection is mainly notable to me for the Bloch story, which is a very memorable (and typically heavy handed) tale of revenge. The Ethiopian tale was definitely intriguing also and disturbing. Unfortunately a lot of the stories are clunkers, especially the Ramsey Campbell tale."
5,Was that really my life?,"Education of a Felon: A Memoir Is a book, of Edward Bunkers life, from childhood to 40 years of age, most time spent in reform schools,and prisons,pain and solitude were all he knew,for 18 years. He had to have a special someone,looking after him. He's for real and his book describes in detail, what life is like on the inside of prisons,and the workings of his innermost thoughts.Alone and beaten he rose up from the ashes of his life."
3,Exquisite moments but uneven translation!,"There are moments in this novella in which Oe's descriptive ability and allegorical vision combine to produce a work of power. Oe is fairly new to me, but the broader historical horizon in --and of -- which he writes is not. Perhaps as a result, I found the story deeply moving, on many levels. As a writer, however, I have to say that I found the translation very uneven. I'm ""turned off"" and my reading is interrupted by obvious grammatical mistakes and this text contains several. It is possible that the translators might plead special circumstances but I doubt that would really hold. From the point of view of overall quality, this translation would --I think-- have a hard time competing with Jay Rubin's work with Haruki Murakami's ""Wind up Bird.."""
1,Bad and Badder,"Okay, I'll start with the good points.1. good for little kids who know a lot of weird humor2. sort of funny, even when you look back on it3. nice, if you have a small kid, buy it.now, the bad parts.1. Junie B. Jones is retarded.2. bad grammar3. story is usually very boring unless you're smallSome people may think it's stupid, but this is a book for kids who have just learned to read chapter books. I DO NOT recommend it for kids over 7, but children under 7 will learn a lot from it. (including how not to cut their hair)"
1,Must have missed that....,"This book was very disappointing. The authors use of nicknames and other jargon is completely overdone. He spends more time trying to convince you that he was part of a privileged circle. He also focuses on a small handful of factory riders when racing was made up of many stellar privateers. But the beauty of the racing in that era was that all of the riders supported each other, partied together, traveled together and had a very close camaraderie that does not exist in racing today. It did not matter if you rode for H-D or BSA or Triumph or were a privateer - you were friends and stuck together. This author unfortunately does not capture the true essence of that era in racing. Read Gerald Foster's book instead."
5,Grand National: America's Golden Age of Motorcycle Racing,A must have for any fan of flattrack racing. Another example of the excellent writing of Joe Scalzo.
1,Hazardous to the life of your toilet,Dont ever buy any toilet cleaning tablets that are dropped into the toilet tank. Those containing bleach will harm the rubberized parts of the tank and you will end up replacing them. Plumbers will strongly advise against dropping anything into your toilet tank. Take the advice.
2,good fit but rusted quickly,"like the design detail, the adaptability, bottle holder, etc but for something that is going to get wet the material rusted within a week"
4,beanie buddy ty nuzzle,"over all the sipping was fast and on time. yes a dog arrived but it's not the dog in the picture. very disappointed that the ad doesn't match up to the dog. in the pic ad it shows ty dog nuzzle with a ribbon around his neck, the one i ordered did not come with one. i only wanted this one because i thought it was supposed to come that way, other wise i could have ordered the dog that i did receive from a different site for cheaper."
2,Disappointed!,"I bought this on the reviews, but was sorely disappointed, the birds singing is so OBVIOUSLY CONTRIVED, it didnt even sound natural, the birds are real all right, but the ""SINGING"" part is too MATCHED to the music. Not at all like birds sound in the wild. I've heard many kinds of birds sing NATURALLY all together and much prettier than this. The music you can find on any classical Cd. Go for that or birds alone. just my humble opinion-also a friend who heard it."
5,Excellent,"To buy a book written by a psychologist and then accuse her of ""psychobabble"" as some reviewers have done seems strange to me. Plus, Dr. Peterson does not write ""babble"" of any kind. She reviews recent scientific research on the brain and then suggests behaviors that will help anyone deal with the physical and psychological issues involved with writer's block. Her writing is easy to understand but sophisticated in content. I have already found her book helpful, and recommend it to anyone dealing with this difficult issue."
3,Write In 10 Days.,"The book came in good condition from the seller, I've just started the book and it has a big focus on psychological issues that may block your writing...hopefully it gets better."
3,"Clarion, can you make one just as easy to clean.. that works?","Clarion, this unit is the best one I have ever found to clean. Most units create mold, especially when used often due to their designs. Your unit is the easiest to clean ever. It is amazing that it is dishwasher safe as well.Unfortunately the basic functionality issues prevent the unit from working properly.. something most other units do pretty easily. Please fix that part & I'll keep your unit the next time I buy it."
3,help - need a new tank,"my clairion puts a lot of water into the air. overall i am satisfied, though it is loud. however, I recently broke a tank while filling it (the design is a little unfriendly). does anyone have an extra tank they don't need? i believe they are interchangable. thanks."
4,Enlightening,"I just read this book, and I found this book extremely helpful at a time when I was ready to give up on my 13 year marriage. Since I believe we choose partners to help us heal old childhood wounds, this book provided the perfect explanation of why we had chosen each other and why we were never able to accomplish the close, open relationship I was seeking. I don't want to give up on this marriage, and since it takes two to tango, we have elected to seek counseling. We obviously BOTH need to learn how to cope, to change and to grow. I now have hope.I did read a few of the other reviews, and I will add that this book does not provide guidance for the passive agressive man - it wasn't written for him. It provides insight and possible understanding for those living and working with these types. There is no miracle cure for passive agressive behavior and you won't find one in this book."
4,A true revelation for me...,"This book explained the elements of my 33-year marriage, the heart of our struggles and subsequent divorce. It touched on details of interactions that I did not realize were related. I wish I had read it decades ago. My only criticism is that the examples are mostly from couples who are dating or other short term relationships. I would like to see Mr. Wetzler do a second book dealing with the dynamics of a long term marriage, layered with the stresses of raising children and the family dynamic that results. It would deal with deeper and more complex issues. Still, the concepts presented in this book were so right on, that I was very surprised. It has helped me redefine a lot of elements of my life -- past, present, and future. I have given copies to my adult children and they are appreciating the explanations of mom and dad, as well as cautions for their own lives."
3,thanks,"your product was packaged and shipped very quickly, seems to be of high quality and I have enjoyed reading it, thanks,"
2,Too Few Nuggets,"This was a frustrating book to read. While there were descriptions of typical behavior, there were examples following which were too specific. My passive-aggressive guy found many ways to wiggle out of ""owning"" the behavior because the example following wasn't exactly what he says or does. Also, there were few practical strategies for dealing with this behavior. The strategies given are manipulative and my husband senses it, leaving us both more frustrated than ever."
5,Brilliant but less than I anticipated...,"Although it is a well put together book, I was a bit disappointed moreso from some of my own expectations. If you are a PLAYBOY fan, buy this book! I was, however, expecting to see all the playmates which did not happen :-(The photography is first class as they had selected the best of the best from its archive of over 10 million images. It is a brilliant review of 50 years of not only PLAYBOY but the history of that past era and it is well worth it."
3,Shattered droppers,"Of the 12 bottles orderede, 2 of the bottles had broken droppers INSIDE the bottles! The bottles were packaged quite well so the droppers must have been broken BEFORE they were packed."
4,"Besides The Ranting, Great Tunes!","Tom Petty will never be a great politician, but he can still write a great tune. The Last DJ features strong songs from beginning to end, and even the most lyrically heavy handed tunes grow on you. This outing is more Beatles influenced than any of Petty's work to date, focusing in on Lennon's piano written tunes to great effect.Mr. Petty should relect on his lyrics a little more before comitting them to CD. In particular, complaining about the ""golden circle"", or whatever it's called, seems completely uninformed.OK, promoters are asking the fans who care the most to pay the most money for tickets. In the past, stadium insiders and radio programmers recieved these very same tickets as graft and scalped them to the same fans. The difference now is the performer actually gets some of the hefty ticket price rather than some scum bag scalper.How is that a bad thing, Tom?"
3,Not the best...,"Petty has become of those artists where I buy the album without hearing a single first. Usually he does not disappoint. This one, however, does. Its a bit preachy, and I don't believe there is a real standout song on the album. Having said that, even the worst Tom Petty album is still better than 95% of everything else."
4,"Very Personal, hit the mark.","First of all, I'm surprised the record label put this one out...their greediness is the main topic. Only track I don't like is ""Joe"", although I think the point is relevant.I love the ballads, incredibly personal I think. ""Dreamville"" takes me away to somewhere happy, ""Have Love Will Travel"", wow. How hard is it to tell someone ""you were the one"" in front of the world? ""Like A Diamond"", she goes on forever. This has to touch anyone who's ever had their heart broken.Thanks Tom."
2,Not one of Petty's best,"Simply put, Tom needs to get back to spending some more time with regular ""Joe's"" or something. I've been a Petty fan since about 1979 and have found his records to be spotty...couple of great songs, with some ok ones and maybe a little filler. The exceptions to me would be Damn the Torpedoes, Full Moon Fever, Wildflowers and Long After Dark, which are all grade A from start to finish. This is one of the first Petty records that doesn't even have one classic song on it....I wouldn't care if I ever heard any of these songs again. Musically, they're all fine. Lyrically, I can't relate to a guy who has made his living from the music industry (and a pretty good living at that) making a record bemoaning the current state of affairs with it. I mean, if he wants to moan in private, fine, but why not counter the lame music industry with a great album? This one doesn't do it for me. Boo!"
2,tired Note good Message though,"the Lyrical Content of this Album especially the lead off single""The Last DJ"" got alot of Buzz.but that also was a Smooth Cover up for the same tired Sound this Cat is still Producing.nothing different here.the Music Sounds like most of His Other Albums especially in recent memory.someone should tell me too be believeable leave the Major Company like Prince&Michael Jackson did.He still works for Warners??the Music is safe overall."
2,"ugh, a terrible concept (2.5 stars)","First let me say that this is a terrible concept for an album. Petty sounds like he's a grumpy old man mumbling nonsense instead of an angry rock n roller. Songs like ""The Last DJ"", ""Joe"", and perhaps the worst song of his career, ""Money Becomes King"" show just how terrible it is as a subject to sing about.The good news: he doesn't stick to the concept for long. The second half of the album is much better, staying away from all that dj crap. Songs like ""Blue Sunday"", ""You and Me"", and the fun ""The Man Who Loves Women"" show that he's still in top form, as long as he's not writing about something stupid. I look forward to his next album, where he won't focus on a topic as dumb as radio and money."
5,Perfect for my beginner,This product was recommended by my son's piano teacher and I was so happy to find it here at such a great price. It has worked perfectly and has helped my son to keep the proper rhythm instead of rushing through songs.
1,Didn't work at all,"Perhaps it was just this one metronome, however it did not work at all! It looked cheap, and just did not turn on at all!"
3,Decent,"The Matrix MR500 is a great portable metronome. It has 2 modes. One with just a light blinking and one with clicking. It comes with an optional in-ear device as well. I really like the dial feature as it's easy to put it where you want it. This product has its limitations though. You only get the preset bpms on the dial (if you want 123 bpm, you're stuck with choosing 120 or 125 instead). It can't listen to a beat and calibrate its bpm to it. It doesn't change cadence on beats (ONE-two-three-ONE-two-three). You cannot adjust the volume. Some other metronomes also come with a tuner. These are just some things to consider when buying this metronome over other ones that might have more features."
4,Great,My usage for the this product was not for music but weight training. I slow burn train this is when you perform each individual exercise with deliberate slowness. I am able to accomplish this with the Matrix Metronome tempo range and audible beat w/ light or light only.
3,"Driver Eight, the great unknown Tooth and Nail band.","No, they do not sound like Supergrass. I just got this cd in the mail and was trying to think who they sound like. Actually it's the Canadian indie bands of the early- to mid-1990s, like Pure and The Doughboys. Mix in a bit of the Stone Temple Pilots' ""Core"" and current Foo Fighters, and you have Driver Eight. There are some great songs in here, and some droners, so overall I will keep it and give it three stars."
2,archaic lexicography,This book reflects pre-modern theories of etymological science. It is very inaccurate in its classification of cognates within the Indo-European family and this mitigates its usefulness considerably. We need a concise edition of Frisk or Boisacq.
3,JE has done better,"This ep was kinda depressing. But i wish ronnie and jeff would put out more cd's and less ep's. It seems as if they what to put somthing out every 6 months! Note to Ronnie and Jeff, u guys r great but stop wasting ur time on ep's and spend more time on full lenght cd's. Warning!!! this ep is not A ""happy"" ep! the songs r slow and the music is borderline dull"
5,Wonderful......every American should read it.,"Mr. Aldrich is an incredible thinker and writer. He objectively describes the various class structures in America and the values that accompany them. The book evinces that there is an inherent responsibility that goes along with financial success in this democratic society and what can result if there is an abrogation of that resonsibility.The book is written from a generous standpoint in that Mr. Aldrich genuinely shares himself with the reader. It is indeed ""a gift"" the ""pietas"" that Mr. Aldrich so eloquently describes."
3,Good Read,"This is #17 in Rimmer's Bravo series, and the fourth to feature the machinations of Vegas' Caitlyn Bravo, albeit briefly.This one is almost all the heroine and her relationships. (But why are they all NEW relationships?) She is initially a strong character and has an interesting back story. (I think she devolved a little bit with the romance; her career definitely took a back seat). And I didn't buy her young age: she seemed a much older character to me.But you don't really get to know the hero that well, on almost any front. Where his sisters-in-law play a prominent role (their stories were previously told in books #10-12), his brothers were invisible. And he was almost as irrelevant. That means that you get no real time to build any sympathy for him.And I would have found everything more believable if the author had spaced it over a longer span of time.Still, with a book by Rimmer and and a guaranteed HEA, you'll have a pretty good time."
4,Dark and Trip Hop,"Open All Night is pure Marc Almond. All his influences, styles, and previous work, combined with a very late 90's sound. For best results play at a higher volume than normal."
5,Great show on para-normal activities,THIS IS A GREAT VIDIO ON PARA-NORMAL ACTIVITES THAT HAVE HAPPENED ON MILITARY POSTS. IT'S WELL MADE AND THEY ARE THE BEST AT THIS TYPE OF INVESTIGATION.
1,Disappointeed,"I ALWAYS look forward to reading Mr. Dickey's books and I rushed out to buy this one as did his others, however, I was completely disappointed.I did not too care for the storyline or the characters. I thought the book was SLOW and after a while I couldn't continue to take the torture and ended up skipping to see what happened in the end.Despite this, Mr. Dickey is still my favorite author. I continue to look foward to reading his books."
1,Not his best .... by far!!!!,"What a let down. I love Eric Jerome Dickey's books and I couldn't wait to start this, but now that I have, I can barely continue and I'm only up to page 40. I've struggled thus far and I don't know if I'll read on much more.It's a completely different style than books like Milk in My Coffee and others, but not in a good way. I am going to be very cautious about getting another book of his if this is his new way of writing. All the characters so far are idiots and it's a tough read.Don't rush out for this one. Please try harder next time, EJD!!"
2,Disappointing to Say the Least,"What happened to the guy who created magic on pages with novels such as "" Sister Sister, Friends & Lovers, Milk in my Coffee and Cheaters""?It must be me alone thinking, ""has Eric Jerome Dickey lost his touch?""After two weeks of struggling to get through ""Between Lovers"" I can't believe I just finished it and walked away thinking I've been cheated once again. Well I've finally learned my lesson, any future novels written by Mr. Dickey will definitely be purchased in paperback form or not at all."
3,Not the average book,"I have read every book written by Eric Jerome Dickey and I love his work. However, in this past book, Between Lovers, something was not the same. I was not able to get into the story like I always do with his other books. I was just reading the book, not because I was interestes, but to see if it was going to get better. Compared to all of his book prior to this one, I wold say this one should be ranked on the bottom."
5,Great choice!,"wonderful book! I love this guy, he writes great books and has you reading it until the end no matter what chapter!"
4,Good Read,I enjoyed reading or should I say listening to this book. I am a Eric Jerome Dickey fan. I think that I have listened to all of his books. Can't wait until the new one comes out.
5,Between Lovers,This is a wonderful book and I would suggest this book to everyone. I love me some Eric Jerome Dickey. I am waiting on his next book.
2,Not the EJD I Know and Love,"Listen people I am a true EJD fan, no questions asked, but I was totally disappointed with this book. The actual story line itself was great( I thought) but the characters were very weak. The male character was so LAME! I have never encountered a man who would deal with a woman with selfish and immature ways. The fact that she was bisexual was ok with me, but her selfishness and her overly dramatic reactions were absurd. I will continue to support my man EJD, I would just pefer he stick with his orginal style of writing. The details of all the running these two characters did was ridiculous, I wish he would have added that much more detail into the plot and the ending of the book. Once I start a book I have to finish it, but this one I really procrasinated on. Better luck next time Eric!"
3,Eric Jerome Dicket Let Me down,"This book was definitely not one of Eric Dickey's best works. I was really surprised because I lovvvvvvve his writing style. The book was about a woman who wanted to have a threesome with her two lovers. Only, in the threesome, neither one of them could touch each other . They could only touch her. It was a book that I read and was like ""What was the point?"" If this is your first time reading an Eric Jerome Dickey book, you will probably like it. But, if you are a faithful Eric Jerome Dickey reader, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Thin plot,"I finished this novel in a day. Not because I liked it so much, but because I could not wait to get free from the torture of reading it. It was bad. This is EJD's poorest novel yet. The plot was thin, and the characters unrealistic. Compared to Dickey's others, this novel is sub par. The novel takes place in the span of a few short days. I felt that there were myriad unresolved issues and many others were left unaddressed. I can't find enough ways to express my disappointment. Short of pointing to specific scenes and giving away the plot, I can't give examples so I will stop here. This novel was a waste of money. I don't say that lightly b/c EJD is one of my favorite authors and I have always had great respect for his talent."
2,He has done much better,"I was very disappointed with this book. I love all of EJD's other novels, but this one totally let me down. I don't feel like the characters were developed very well, and it read like a sex novel. I still remain a great fan of EJD. I just feel that he missed the mark with this one."
4,reader in awe!!!,"I have read all of Eric Jerome Dickeys books and I have to say that he is definetly one of the greatest. One of the things that I love is that he brings other characters from the other books into the scene. That is pure uniqueness!! This book is definetly great not as great as milk in my coffee, but equally great with characters, he really brings the characters out, after I read a book I actually feel that I know the characters or can some how relate to them. Between Lovers, makes you want to hate Nicole the lover that can't make up her mind, but you can't for some reason. She seems lost, and the nameless main character is trying to find her, and ayanna the other lover thinks that she knows Nicole through and through, when in the end i think she did. But all is well in the end with all characters, everyone ends up happy."
4,Solid and convincent,"Despite some weaknesses in tempi and some phrasing in crucialpassages that require for more bravura, those are very solid andconvincent performances, in a very conservative approach. DG hasbeen one of the seals with more issued Brahms cycles and perhapswe can find more compelling anthologies in Celibidache/Stuttgartor Levine/VPO and Abbado/BPO in digital era."
3,Doesn't quite pull it off,"The theory sounds like it would work: take the basics of how a monasatery is run and apply it to raising a family. I don't think the author pulls if off well. I was especially affronted at his ideas about using separation as a means of discipline for children. His use of the concept is not like, the same thing as a time out for a three year old. It's not an awful book or anything, he just didn't convince me that the monastic life is transferrable to a family situation."
4,Does what it should,"About this seller: JP addressed a minor order discrepancy quickly and politely. Great customer service!!THE SHORT OF IT: Answering machine does what it's supposed to, with straightforward operation and decent sound quality.Minor setup annoyances:1. Setting the clock is a bit tedious. It calls out the minutes audibly until you get to the proper time (you can't scroll backwards); a little irritating when you start at :00 and have to go all the way to :552. The cover for the battery backup is held in place by a tiny screw. Who wants to fumble around for a screwdriver? Why not design it with a locking slide type cover?"
3,Math rock.,"I'm not a huge math rock fan... it's always been kind of boring to me. But this album is different. There are actually some hooks there, and the musicians are obviously very skilled. The lyrics have some sense about them, as opposed to being random words assembled together. ""A Girl Named Actually"" and ""Boasting In Weakness"" are great songs, and there are other parts of the album I enjoy immensely as well. The main thing holding this back is a lack of focus in song writing, and the fact that the instrumental parts meander into senselessness far too often. These may be important aspects of this genre, but as a rock fan I don't see how this can be a good thing at all. There's lots of talent here, it's just invested in the wrong places."
4,EXCELLENT READING,I found this excellent book an easy to read comparison of the journey at the same time of these two amazing ship captains. More than enough detail to whet my apetite to read more specifically about the history of the discovery of where i live in South Australia and it made me realise how little i knew about the early days of my own country. How interesting was it that they both treated the early aboriginals with respect and that they displayed friendship and each captain shared their knowledge despite their respective countries being at war. How amazing was Flinders scientific discipline and navigational and plotting skills to produce with the basic scientific instruments of the day such detailed maps that were used up until the 1940s.......
2,A VERY basic book on the subject of intuition!,"I was exceptionally disappointed with this book: I was looking for a book that would have given me greater insight with regards to intuition. I have had some absolutely amazing insights and strokes of intuition that generally come out of the blue. I wanted to learn how to be able to recreate these epiphanies, but even though the author promises greater insight into intuition, what she wrote I already knew. The book is very basic and seemingly hurriedly put together, more geared up toward readers that are broaching the subject for the first time, so not a book that was of any help to me. In comparison Penney Peirce' s ""The Intutive Way"" is a far superior book that is equally fascinating to a first time reader on the subject or someone that uses their intuition but wants to gain greater mastery of it. It is a shame that so few truly exquisite books are written on such a fascinating subject as intuition"
2,A little too dead-on,"The sounds are sugary ear candy for any Sixties addict (nice cover art, as well), but this is not the work of plucky youngsters with a Beatles bent. These studio hacks have crafted an album that might better be titled ""Hey, I just bought a Rickenbacker 12-string; let's try it out."" The melodies and harmonies that we all love are there, but I've heard more heart in a single Oneders b-side (studio musicians all) than the entirety of this disc. There are references aplenty to some wonderful music by the Beatles and XTC, to name but two, but instead of a sly homage, several snippets can be found tone for tone on those artists' songs. And who is this ""she"" that plays such a large role in the lyrics throughout? All we know about her is that she is female and elicits a reaction that we also learn nothing about. Pleasant listening, but it's been done better."
3,HUNTIK,a pretty fun adventure series --join the party as they persue ancient artifacts from their hidden places throughout the world --that can summon various monsters known as titans. If you like indiana jones you'll see the resemblance as they have to go through the catacombs and avoid traps and other places. good stuff.
5,This thing is great,"I would recommend this product to anyone. High quality and useful. The bottle opener does not work great, but it will still open bottles."
4,Convenient,"Perfect for those moments where you go ""I wish I had a screwdriver right now..."" It should only be used in the most dire situations. You aren't going to be able to build a house with this thing, but for those moments where something is better than nothing, this device is perfect. The blade should be sharpened, and my only other concern is that it is hard to open. A better clip mechanism should have been used, but all in all, this is the perfect addition to anyone's keychain"
1,Garbage bound.,"I just tossed this product in the garbage. After several failed attempts to open a bottle I decided it was time to go. Also, the knife IS NOT guarded when it is in the open position (which it is when you are using it as a bottle opener. Although I did not cut myself I can see how it would be very easy to do so."
4,Swiss Tech 6 in 1 keyring tool,Great compact tool that fits perfectly on your keychain. Knife is sharp and the tools are minimalist but extremely usefull in a pinch. bottle opener is a nice plus. A little hard to open but keeps it securly on your keyring.
2,Not great,"I have used other Swisstech key chain tools and have been very happy, but this one is I am not impressed with at all. I bought this because I wanted a small blade with me to quickly open boxes and packages. First, it is not that quick to get out. Second, it is difficult to hold and use (I have cut myself three times already). Anyone who is thinking of using the other features might want to first consider that you will be holding onto the blade in order to use them. The only good things are that it is small (a little longer than a key) and the blade is sharp (good for cutting through flesh while you try to unscrew something).In short pass on this one."
3,Difficult to Use,"I bought two of these, for each of my brothers as a present. One of them was incapable of opening up this UtiliKey, and the other had no problem. I'm not really sure what that says about the product, except maybe it's only 50% useful ;) They work as goofy little gifts, but I'm not sure if they're worth it considering how challenging they are to open up."
3,very awkward.,"great idea, just a little too awkard for me. so far ive only had use for hte buttle opener and the phillips head screw driver. my buddy cut himself pretty bad trying to use the bottle opener! lol i mean i shouldnt laugh at that, cuz blood all over your bottle is a lil nasty."
3,Useful but not very practical,"The fact that it looks like a key is clever and that's what made me want to buy it. But after receiving it and using it a few times, I realized it wasn't very practical. I've only ever pulled it out when I need to cut something because the blade is very sharp. I've never used any of the other tools (phillips head, bottle opener, etc.) because they all require me to grab the tool by the blade, which does not seem like a good idea at all.You can get it and show your friends how cool it is, but in the end it's just a tiny pocketknife."
4,Very handy tool,"This is overall, a really nice tool. For those looking to not necessarily have the most expensive and highest quality tool, but to always have a tool available, this is a nice choice. The design is pretty simple, yet, enough choices to make it desirable. The tools themselves are each useful and fit pretty compactly in the pocket."
2,Very useful tools packed into a brillient design too bad I can't open it.,Very clever design. Passes airport security every time. The tools are perfect for small jobs which is all I need. I have had this tool for 3 1/2 years. Initially I could open and close it with my fingers; now I am a bit older and I need a tool to open it up. If they made a new easy open model I would buy it.
5,Compact key knife,fits well in pocket and on keychain snagfree. great craftsmanship. Nice blade - nicer still after sharpening. Have yet to try out screwdrivers. eyeglass screw driver hard to use. Still a good emergency knife.
2,Good but not Great!,I got this for one reason...to open boxes and or cut things as needed. I work 5 days a week in a warehouse and do not like to carry around large knives or multi-tools. I have enough stuff to carry without the weight of a extra tool. I thought this would solve my problem. First off this is longer than any keys you have so it is constantly getting stuck on something. Second the blade is sharp and not well designed so when you go to open BE CAREFUL! I have almost cut my finger on several occasions. Basically I had to take this off my key chain and dump it.
4,Very handy,"I take this multi-tool with me everywhere on my key chain and everyone is always so intrigued when I pull it out to use it. I would say that on average I use it 2-3 times per week and for a $5-6 value, that is great. It is no bigger than any other key on my ring and it has many useful functions. The only downside is that it can be hard to handle at times when you need torque due to its slim nature and design. Outside of that though it works great and has never fallen off my keys. Just remember to take it off before going to the airport!"
4,Great gift,"This was a great, cheap gift for all of my groomsmen. I even got some for my dad and other friends who helped with the wedding. It's handy in a pinch: the knife is great for opening boxes, for example. The Philips head is a little small to get good traction with an average screw. The bottle opener is pretty uncomfortable to use because you either have to hold the knife blade or pointy flathead. (Personally, I'd rather open a bottle with a lighter or drawer handle in a pinch instead of this tool.) All in all, though, this makes for a handy thing to have around on your keyring."
1,Argh,"I'm sure it's wonderful, but I haven't been able to get the thing open, so I haven't been able to use it!"
4,"simple, sturdy tool","I've only had this item a week or so and I have already used it several times, having found it handy for adjusting bicycle brakes and derailleurs, and for opening boxes. The bottle opener works satisfactorily, provided you keep your fingers away from the blade. Obviously, it's no Leatherman, but the several functions it provides are handy enough to keep it around on your key chain, and it does stay solidly on the keychain when the clasp is shut. This is an elegant piece of design. I'm going to buy a few for upcoming birthdays and spread the love a bit."
5,Awesome tool,"I love this little tool, I've used it many times and I've only had for a month! It has got to be the best key ring held tool I've ever used."
3,cute but....,nice little tool... but buyer need to be aware that there are safety issues when handling this little tool.
5,"Durable, great value","I've had my key for about 3 years, I bought this one for a friend of mine. The one I own has come in handy lots of times. It's durable, stays on my keychain well, and looks a lot like a normal key. People are always impressed when they see what it can do."
3,"It's a KEYCHAIN multi-tool, not a Swiss Army Knife","I have had this tool for four-five years, and can say for a tool that piggy-backs on my keychain it works pretty good.The blade is VERY sharp, but after finding that out the hard way, I treated it with respect and was not sliced since. To protect from accidental cuts, I suggest putting some painter's masking tape or some heat-shrink tubing over the blade, and remove it when you need to.The screwdrivers work fine, and I've had no problems opening bottles.The part that clamps over the keyring recently cracked off, leaving me with a 'keyring multi-tool' that no longer fits on a keyring.I tried drilling a hole through the base, but the metal, although brittle, is hard-tempered and resists drilling.I've put it on my Wishlist, because for the size and convenience, it can't be beat."
3,Fumbly yet unobtrusive,"I'd wanted a small blade for opening packages and a small screwdriver to carry with me all the time. I've had this mini tool on my key chain for a month now and it is unobtrusive but not quite as functional as I'd hoped.First, it is difficult to take off of key ring with out dropping one or the other.Second, I don't actually have my keys in pocket very much, especially at home, which is where I need a tool most often. No keys means no tool nearby.Third, it is very unobtrusive. It is a half inch longer than a std house key but still shorter than my car key. I usually forget I have it with me.Fourth, it does not come open on its own, if fact it's stiff to open, and the tip does not poke or scratch at all.After having it for a while I think that I will also carry a small multi-tool on my belt and keep this with me as a backup."
3,Ok tool.,"I had purchased this when it first came out a few years ago just because it was on clearance. But I always had trouble getting it open without cutting myself. After a while the locking mechanism wore down and made it fall off my key chain, and it ended up becoming a nuisance to use and have.If you are looking for a pocket multitool, buy a pocket multitool. This is more of just a neat gadget then anything else."
4,"Fits in the coin purse, goes everywhere","What a great little tool! I hate key rings, so I was delighted to find this tiny, flat little tool easily joins my house and car keys, quarters and guitar picks in my 2.5"" coin purse - brilliant! I'm constantly pulling it out to open boxes, cut things, tighten/loosen a screw or open a bottle of beer.It's not a brilliant bottle opener, as the knife blade levers down onto the hand holding the bottle as the cap comes off, but, having said that, it works and I've yet to cut myself. It also snaps shut quite firmly, making it difficult to open with greasy or sweaty hands. On the other hand, it's probably better it shuts so firmly; the knife is sharp and it's good to know it won't accidently pop open.It definitely has a lot of cool factor; several friends who have seen mine have gone on to get their own."
5,Great usage,This was very useful and small so it was not bulky. I liked the option of it staying hidden until usage
4,Very useful little tool when you forget to bring better equipment,"This little tool really is a last resort only to be used if you are basically stuck somewhere and need to fix something but you left any real tools behind on accident. This tool has served me well many times, but it has never been easy to use. I have used every function on it, and I've owned if to about 2 years. The biggest problem I have had with it is when it falls off my key ring without me knowing. Sometimes the tool will open in your pocket, then when you take your keys out it will fall to the ground. It's hard to notice it falling since it's so small and light weight. I would suggest buying the 2-pack just to keep a spare.Note that the tool can open all the way up so that it is straight. It took me a while to realize that, since the first stop is only 90 degrees. I thought I would break it if I pried it open all the way. One day I didn't care if it broke or not and was pleasantly surprised when I discovered the full open mode."
3,sharp and inconvenient,"Sometimes you need to cut plastic wrapping or open a cover fixed by a screw and Utili-Key looks like a tool that would help in such cases. However, the only usable part of this tool is a blade which is very sharp and pointy. Using a screwdriver you have to hold the tool very carefully to avoid cutting yourself and you have to change the grip every half of a turn. If there is more that one screw I will go looking for a proper screwdriver.A bottle opener is also pretty much useless as it provides almost no leverage. I suppose it is still better than nothing.Buy it for as a very portable knife but don't expect more."
3,Great for a year; but it breaks from regular use,"I loved this little gadget. I was incredible convient, but after regular usage the metal hook that is use to click-lock the thing snapped off. Overall still great product while it lasted."
5,Awesome!!,"Even better than I expected. Delivery was quick, in tack and clean. My husband LOVES it and now all the guys at his job wants one. I want one too! It's very small, similar to a house key but slim. Overall this is a very good buy. EVERYONE can use this at some point. Even the girlie girls."
5,A must read before negotiating price for a new car,"An excellent resource for the new car buyer, this book allows one to flip a page and compare virtually all makes and models of cars, minivans, and SUV's prior to purchase (excluding pickup trucks). Each vehicle is reviewed individually and the dealer invoice is included for all trims, including options! Considering the price, this book can easily provide a hundred-fold return on investment."
5,Phenomenal.,"Without merely echoing the converted listeners above, let me just say that this disc is a masterpiece! If I had to sum up my review in two words, those words would be ""beautifully intense."""
1,4 Billion Bucks 3D,This movie was a total waste! The minute I got from it was so horrible! It's a total waste of money! The camera man must of been on LSD when he was filming it.
4,The Power of Belief,"I have just read two short novels by Jane Yolen. The second of these is THE TRANSFIGURED HART. Hunting season is about to begin and a white deer is spotted separately by to schoolmates. One believes him to be a unicorn while the other believes him to be a white deer. Soon the two discover that their secret is known by the other. But the boy manages to convince the girl that the creature really is a unicorn and they must save it from the coming hunt.This is an interesting tale that has a white deer transformed by the power of belief into a creature of magic and legend. A very entertaining, but short, tale of conviction and desperation."
4,Was a nice gift,"I bought this book online as a gift for a new friend. Before I turned It over to them, I did review several of the poems. I will likely buy a copy for myself because the subject matter of the poems are more diverse than the title implies, and the images of artwork add IMMENSE value to the book. It really does give insight into a beautiful and interesting culture. Anybody studying Persians or Iran should consider reading this book in order to add substance and color to the ""facts"" that we think we know about Persian people."
3,hmm...,"I have never heard of Vampire the Masquerade and simply got this album because I like some goth music and I'm beginning to like dance music. Anyways, I'm not sure that this album really follows along with most music in the ""goth"" genre, and before I knew it was affiliated with a game, I was quite surprised that this would be considered goth because the lyrics don't really go with what I'd expect. Anyways, this is an ok album, so if you want to buy it I say go for it. My favorite track would have to be ""Fall No More"" (Bella Morte)."
5,Toner,Product arrived in a timely manner. The product was the actual Canon product and not a generic look alike.
1,Runs out too quickly,"I have had several printers and used many different types of cartridges and this by far has the worst life. I am constantly changing toner cartridges--at least once a month. The machine will not print faxes if it thinks the catridge is low even though hundreds of more pages could still be printed. I spend at least a week to 10 days every month constantly shaking the cartridge, taking it in and out of the machine, trying to get faxes to print. I will make sure not to have to use canon catridges again when i get a new printer."
5,Good Deal,"Jut pop the cartridge in and it works fine, of course. Amazon sold it for about $13 less than everone else. With free shipping and handling, what's not to like??"
2,Disappointly low yield,"I purchased the Canon brand rather than one of the compatible brands to refill my ink cartridge. I regret to say that it ran out of ink surprisingly quickly. No, I didn't ""count"" the amount of pages that it printed, but I will say that I only went through apprxomately TWO 500 page packages before it started beeping and saying that I needed to charge the cartridge. Sure, shaking the cartridge got me through a few more weeks. Still, not what you expect when you pay so much money for an ink cartridge."
1,Cartridge life stinks!,"My previous printer was an HP 1320 and I replaced cartridges once a year. My printing load has not changed and I put a new cartridge in my Canon printer, after I bought it late last year and the original cartridge run out soon after. It has been less than two months and the printer is already indicating that it is low in toner. Based on my experience with the original cartridge, I estimate I have 3 to 4 more weeks with the annoying warning, but then the toner will be really out. This is ridiculous; it is one quarter of the life of my old generation HP printer."
2,Does it print less than it used to?,"I love my 4350 imageclass, just like I loved the 4100. I am a very high-volume printer for my law office, where we have 2 of these. It seems like the Canon 104 Toner cartridges used to last a lot, lot longer. Is it my imagination or in the past several months do they print less and less? What a racket. We are going to have to ditch both of these printers. We've had them for years, and if anything the volume we put out of them has gone down, yet we are changing the cartridges every couple of weeks where it used to be every couple of months - I truly believe something has changed with the 104's. Am I off base?"
3,Far less than 2000 pages,"So there is a lot of talk about page yield with the Canon 104 toner cartridge vs knock offs. Many reviews of 104 compatibles complain of low yield. Well, guess what? I just finished my original Canon 4350d cartridge and I checked the page count: 829. I print letters and invoices with just text, no gray scales. I'm not printing novels, but I don't know what ""5% coverage"" (Canon 2,000 page spec) really is. Apparently it is a couple of paragraphs.I feel more comfortable trying a Canon 104 compatible cartridge for a replacement seeing how few pages i got with the OEM Canon 104 that came with my printer.Comments welcome. Did I get less pages because Canon puts in a 1/2 full cartidge when you buy the printer? If that is the case, then my page count is about right."
4,Good Starting Book,"This is a very solid book to read in your quest of mastery. Not quite the total package. I think the book on Mastery by George Leonard covers the whole realm of mastery a little better. This book does make a couple of great points, like when your practicing a skill to over compensate by doing the complete oppsoite. If your shooting a basketball & keep missing to the right then practice missing a couple to left so you can find balance & make the shot down the middle. This also teaches you mentally to that you can control balance by being unbalanced, which will make help you see being balanced more clearly. A little weird but works. But this is only one of many good points I think Millman gives. Its a great start for mastery & is highly recommend"
3,it is highly eclected.,My expectation was to read some principles rather than some success stories which do not have some common guiding rules.
1,Lubes are such a scam,"My girlfriend and I have used my different lubes. Edible or not they are mostly overpriced garbage, they taste bad, dry up quick all sticky like, plus contain stuff any health nut like me don't wanna ingest. Why doesn't anyone ever tell you that extra virgin coconut oil is a great lube, massage oil, and will actually cure a yeast infection. It makes a healthy replacement for butter in any recipe I have ever tried. It is expensive to fry with, but a cheap and healthy massage/lube. It smells and tastes like coconut plus eating it everyday is great for body and mind. Please do yourself a favor and try a jar of coconut oil.. even the refined kind is better than any synthetic lube on the market."
5,Note pad,"TOPS Memo Sheets, 4 x 6 Inches, 200 Sheets, White (7851) is just right for what I need in a scratch pad, Great Price and service from Amazon too."
5,not delivered,"I think that I would enjoy this book if I indeed had ever been delivered this book. I have e-mailed a couple weeks agao and was ensured that the book would one day arrive, however that day has not arrived as of yet.Tom Vincent"
5,Outstanding commentary on misunderstood books,"As I have been studying through the Old Testament, I certainly wasn't looking forward to plowing through the lists and (so I thought) rehashed history of the books 1 & 2 Chronicles. This commentary, however, brought those lists and history to life in a way that I could never have imagined. Dr. Hill is a gifted writer, and uses the strengths of the NIVAC series to present an interesting and thoroughly enjoyable commentary. I have already given my copy to a friend to enjoy, and I recommend this commentary without any reservations. I think you'll find yourself immersed in the world of the Hebrews and come to an understanding of their minds and their scripture that Christians have come to use for their knowledge and edification."
4,High value; decent quality; better flamenco elsewhere.,"I saw the movie Vicky Cristina Barcelona, and was entranced by the Flemenco guitar songs. Shopping on Amazon, I bought this. It is a great value and volume of music, and includes classical works. However, Woody Allen did a great job selecting music for that movie, so while there are only 12 songs on the soundtrack, the vast majority of his flamenco tunes are superior to those here. My rating of 4 stars reflects the good price/value ratio of this CD, otherwise it would be a 3."
4,excellent guitar performances,Outstanding guitar performances. I gave it only 4 stars because I do not personally like some of the compositions.
5,You need this CD,"Either one of the two CDs are worth the asking price. The two together are a deal of a lifetime. Just read the list of performers - John Williams, Julian Bream, Pepe Romero, Andreas Segovia - this alone should tell you you're in for a treat!The first CD starts with Pepe Romero's famous performance of the Rodrigo Guitar Concerto. Romero's delivery is crisp and vibrant, perhaps one of the best recordings of this piece that exists today.The Asturias (also played by Romero) is another of my favorites, closely followed by the Bach transcriptions.The rest of the tracks (37 in all) are all similarly excellent.I wish I could write more, but my wife waits impatiently.Buy it - I promise you'll love it."
2,how to get lost in Rome,"This Rome Walking Guide included an eclectic mix of sites to visit, and the walks were comprehensive. However, it omitted precise directions to and from each attraction. Addresses for most sites were omitted, as were many street names. The included maps were not very detailed and ended up confusing us more than helping. We found ourselves frustrated and lost more times than not. The compact size of the guide made it easy to carry around, but it was lacking in historical background. A bit more information on the attractions would have enhanced the experience of each walk. Overall, the guide lacked clarity, detailed directions, instructions and background -- all crucial for a special experience. I would not recommend this guidebook for first time visitors to Rome."
2,ugh,"well, I didn't expect it to be like this...wasn't what i thought it was. but if you like the history of prostitution...then this is for you. it was ok!"
1,Didn't work,I bought this hair product and the product didn't work. It wouldn't dispense any of the product. I returned the product for a full refund and did not buy a new one. I do not know how the product works. I am giving 1 star due to the bottle not even working.
3,Great,"Works great, it holds without making your hair get hard. It stays put, even after a long day of work"
2,Not for everybody,"This book isn't for everybody; it certainly wasn't for me. Granted, I was so unimpressed that I didn't finish it, so take that as you see fit. This book reads like a college essay, covering the same points over and over and over and using exaggerated and sometimes unrealistic examples. The book talks about how thoughts aren't reality and how everyone's perspectives are different - common sense things like that.This book mainly brings people back from the edge to an equilibrium state by pounding some basic principles into their minds. I feel I'm already at the state he tries to bring you to, and his suggestions won't make a person like me happier.If you're looking for common sense and equilibrium, I recommend this book, but if you're looking for something more, I'd say to move along."
1,seeing,"I have had a problem with seeing which keys are being played. In the end I devised a ""note"" method to keep track of what comes next. This is a serious failing in this dvd. It was all there was, so I had little choice."
2,Disappointing entry in the series,"Much as I enjoyed the first three books in the series, I was disappointed by the disjointed plot and I felt manipulated as a reader when unlikely piled upon unlikely event. The author is very skilled but this book is not representative of her considerable skills"
5,Every Kindle book in the series was totally enjoyable.,"Part of my enjoyment of this series is because I am Episcopalian and can understand the challenges of a female Episcopal priest, and because I live near the Adirondacks and the fictional place descriptions seem believable. The author spins a good tale and keeps the plot moving. I read all the books in order, as fast as I could download the next book. I truly hope new books aren't cranked out until I become bored with the characters. I hope the editor has faith in Spencer-Fleming's ability to write novels with different characters and situations. I also think this story line would make a great TV series.NanM"
1,Horrible,I bought this cd for a dollar at some store..thinking it would be alright because its on tooth and nail..and they sometimes have good music..but this is just bad. Its annoying and hard to listen to the next song..im sad i even payed a dollar to buy this cd. Do your self a favor and do not even look or listen to this cd.
5,Brilliant! Such beautiful writing.,"This is one of the most brilliant books I have ever read. Jon Boorstin is a literary genius. It is the first time I wrote a review for a book, and that says a lot. I found it imperative to write this review because I just had to. To not give this the review it deserves would be sacrilege. This is now one of my favorites. Read it and see for yourself what a writer who has mastered his craft truly is."
3,Excellent for budding law geeks,"If you know that you really like the law, then this book is for you. Otherwise--avoid it; a better introduction to the study of law for a neophyte is ""Planet Law School"". That said, the diligent study and internalization of this book will enhance your enjoyment of a first year course in the law of torts (not to mention raise your final exam grade). I should know, having survived a full year of torts with Professor Johnson himself."
2,Adequate - More Romance than Fantasy,"This is a book that started with a tremendous amount of promise, and somehow ended up being a little less than adequate. The author gives us a wonderful premise - a talented artist has somehow created a musical conduit between the real and the realm of the Sidhe when she paints, and then goes absolutely nowhere.Perhaps I should have been forewarned when the author wrote in his acknowledgments (""Author's Note) that ""Despite the title, there is little actual music in this book."" What you've got is a soupcon on Celtic fairy overlaid on a fairly average romance - of the Harlequin variety. The author should have also noted that ""Despite the presence of fairies, there is very little magic in this book.""Not particularly well written or particularly poorly written, just average."
2,Flimsy Zipper Pulls - Broken Handle,"This bag has protected my 17"" laptop very well (so far). The telescoping handle is nicely designed. The shoulder strap is very comfortable. Plenty of room. On one flight I used the plane-side check-in, when the bag was returned the rubber handle was broken (the bag wasn't overly heavy, I am amazed that it could be broken). So the broken handle joined virtually all of the zipper pulls which have broken over time. I suppose I will have to buy something to replace the pulls, and maybe there is an adhesive stronger that the original rubber in the handle (doubt it), but for the price of the bag it has not faired well over time."
3,The Dummies Guide to Aquinas,"Generally well written and an enjoyable read.One qualification - Renick's application of 'the principle of double effect' in the case of an ectopic pregnancy is seriously flawed. By following Renick's approach, you could be incorrectly drawn to believe that Aquinas would sanction the direct (primary) action of removing an embryo from the fallopian tube. This is not how 'the principle of double effect' is intended to be applied. This principle does not support any act which is intrinsically evil (abortion)."
2,One DVD in color and one in Black & White?,"Not sure why, but my 2nd DVD with Corrina, Corrina was in Black & White? Otherwise, I love the movies."
1,Bad discs - what?,"I wanted a DVD of Clara's Heart to replace my worn out VHS. This was a great value in theory. The discs are dual sided with 1 movie per side. They are SUPPOSED to be brand new discs, yet all four sides were scratched all over suggesting previous use. Worse, one disc on one side had a scratch so bad rendering that movie not viewable. There was no option to replace the videos. At least Amazon issued a prompt refund and I purchased these again, but direct from Amazon. They arrived in excellent condition."
2,POS,"Had the blower for less than a year. It was one of the harder ones I have owned to start. Worked OK until the pull rope came undone. It did not break, just came off. Tried to reconnect it myself but did not have the tools and it appeared to need a complete breakdown to get to the winding spindle. Threw what I could in recyclers and the rest in the garbage."
2,"Excellent for 2 yrs, then DOA.","Liked just about everything about this blower for 2 seasons, (with the exception of the stupid 40:1 gas:oil ratio that means you have to keep yet _another_ gas can of 2-stroke around as opposed to using the more normal 50:1). Yes, was definitely loud, and vibrated a decent bit, but most importantly, it did a great job of moving those leaves!Unfortunately, here we are in Yr 3, and after only 2 seasons of what I would consider very light use, (i.e. perhaps 2 days @ 3-4 hrs / day / yr - so a grand total of 16 hrs of usage) it's entirely dead, and not worth investing the money in to get it working again.Since I'm sure I can do better than spending $50/yr, will _not_ be purchasing this unit again, (heck, I can hire a guy to come and do it for me for cheaper than that!) and would suggest you look elsewhere, as well."
5,Absolutely Fantastic,"When I started reading this book I knew that it would be a challenge to my belief system. The title ""It's Not About You"" troubled me, but it was what I needed to hear. This book reminds us that the world does not evolve around us! God has the big picture in mind.Although we may go through many trials and tribulations, God is the same yesterday, today and forever. The author did a great job reminding us that God is not surprised about what is going on in our lives. He is in control and He cares!I guarantee that once you start reading this book, you will be encouraged. You will gain more knowledge on how to have joy in times of adversity. This book is a must read!"
4,Tree of Life,"The Tree of Life by Rochelle Strauss and illustrated by Margot Thompson is an excellent resource book to use in and out of the classroom. There are many interesting facts in the book, not only for children to read, but adults as well. The Tree of Life does a wonderful job of explaining biodiversity to children and is great for plant and animal lovers! I think that every classroom should have a copy of this book! It is very hard to find appealing Science books for children and this book is appropriate for just that!"
2,Unpleasant tone,"The narrative voice comes across as arrogant and hypocritical which makes it hard to keep reading. But the book does provide some useful information on Ugandan history, culture, and tradition."
3,Pretty Awesome CD,"MxPx is a great band with serious talent, and ""On The Cover"" is a collection of cover songs that MxPx decided to do after they released their sophomore album. It includes songs like ""Summer Of 69"" by Bryan Adams, ""Take On Me"" by a-Ha, ""Drum Machine Joy"" by Joy Electric, and of course ""No Brain"" by The Cootees! It's a fun album and is just the right length...even if it is only 8 songs. 3 stars."
1,"Short, but sweet","This is my first encounter with MxPx, and I have to admit, I'm impressed. They choose old favorites and redefined them! My only qualm is the length (or lack of it). I'm definately going to investigate MxPx in the future."
1,Keyhole effect and/or no exposure.,"I've owned this lens for a few years and have tried it with various cameras (still and camcorder) with various thread (30mm and 37mm).1.) Keyhole effect is insane and unavoidable. Unless you run the camera at max zoom, you'll always be looking down the tunnel.2.) The lens doesn't allow much light in. Unless you're on a beach at noon, you're not likely to be able to see your subject.3.) Not compatible with infrared. :)"
5,"Great for us ""older"" ladies!!",I was down to my last lip base and my supplier quit selling this so was very pleased to find it on Amazon and I received it in a very timely order and now have a lifetime (ha) supply.
1,DOES NOT COME OUT!!!!,"I am not freakish about my girls getting messy, but when something says it is washable, it should be washable. The first time we played with this paint, they got messy and wet and changed their clothes about three times each. I figured that it was no big deal. I'll just throw them in the wash when they are done, which I did. To my HORROR, the paint did not come out. I washed them again and again with different soaps and stain treaters, in the sink with dishwashing soap, even bleach and water on the white. NOTHING WORKED!!!!! This paint ruined at least $100 worth of clothes. BEWARE, it does NOT come out!!!!!!!! Especially, the blue!"
2,too hard for most !!!!,"The exercises are a bit hard to do even for an exercise buff like me. It demands that we have a very flexible body. Even the very start, the stretching exercises, these are a bit too much for most men. I think, he should have an easier version."
4,This is unlike anything you have every done!,"This workout is so much fun! It helps relieve stress and gives you an excellent cardio workout. You will definitely sweat. The moves can be a little difficult at first, but just stay with it and follow Billy's instructions to ""take it back to a walk"" or ""go only for the knee"" and you'll have it in no time!"
3,"Decent workout, but pricey","The instructional video included in this set is really a complete waste. You'll watch it once and then you'll never watch it again. The basic workout is pretty good, using a simple variety of kicks and punches, but a relatively active person will quickly find this too easy. It ends up being an expensive investment for what essentially is a 30 minute tape and workout."
4,It works.,"I was an exercise-hater until a friend told me to try this. Without going into a long story - I've lost over 50 pounds, and I give a lot of the credit to the video since it got me moving. I never even did the instructional video since I borrowed the tape, and it was still easy. At first I did everything really low-impact, and as I got stronger, I picked up the pace. The video grew with me, so to speak.No, the set and the music and the video quality aren't up there with Kathy Smith or others, but Blanks is a good instructor and isn't intimidating to someone who has logged a lot of couch time (i.e., myself)."
5,Tae-bo is a progressively challenging workout,"I do Tae-bo every day. I started with the Basic and now do the Advanced. I still sweat alot, have fun and don't get bored. After I had been doing the workout for a month, I went running with my husband. Before I couldn't even run a half a mile before stopping to pant. Now I ran 2 miles without stopping. I never realized how much strength Tae-bo was giving me. Not only am I benefiting physically, Tae-bo gives me an ""attitude"" of confidence and strength. I encourage everyone to try Tae-bo. Just be prepared to be pushed!"
5,When can I get more Advanced Workouts from Billy Blanks?,"It's fun, a challenge and healthy. I've lost weight, my blood pressure has dropped and I am filled with energy after my early morning workouts. When is Billy going to make more advanced tapes available to the public?"
3,It has possibilities but...,"The Instructional is rather tedious unless you are really slow at picking up or understanding the techniques; the Basic is just that - Basic - but I think the upper body moves truly have value and are easily transferable to the workplace i.e. take a 15 break and try some speed bag, jabs or other punches - women, you WILL see a difference in your upper arms - the kicks and lower body work out are good too if you do focus as much on your abs as your kicks - forget kicking like those in the video - just stay moving - however, turn off the volume once you know the routines - the music is worse than chinese water torture - but again, focus on its value which it has - just wish he had a better intermediate tape- to go from an 18 minute basic to a 45 minute advanced is not a good progression - also, don't just do Tae Bo - diversify, diversify, diversify - one last tidbit - with videos in the home, you can wear whatever you want (or don't want) and no one knows"
2,Don't DO IT!!,Don't buy this tape if you are an average out of shape person! You could really hurt yourself just ask my chiropractor. This tape is not safe and is rather ameturish. Unless you are in shape and want to stay that way and know the proper form. You really need to be solid to do these. I implore Billy Blanks to stop marketing this tape to the out of shape overweight person as if it were the answer to all of our workout needs.
5,Billy Blanks is a great workout!,"This is a must! The work out is so prowerful, it give you a total body workout,he's your personal trainer,it motivates you. I lost 2-3inch in 3weeks and losing still and tigthing, all those other video's are sissy .Billy Blanks is # 1. Thank to Billy Blanks. Brenda vizzard"
3,Too Little Punch for the Price,"Even though I liked the way Billy shows the moves slowly and precisely on the instructional video, I don't think the workout video lives up to the hype it has received in terms of time (only 27 mins of workout?? for $40) and quality. By quality I mean: crummy ""music"", camera person pans faces when should be showing entire body moves, Billy's voice not stronge enough over ""music"", stretches too fast and ineffective and overall workout didn't amount to much. I have many workout tapes and the good ones use an entire 60 mins with a long warm up and cool down and plenty of goodies in between to get a good, well-rounded workout. Billy is great and has a great philosophy and idea, but it's as if some smart ""workout"" type guru should have helped him more. I do kick boxing at my gym and I'll stick to that even though, like I said, Billy did clarify the ""moves"" well. Sorry, but too much spent on too little."
5,This is actually fun!,"I bought the two video pack and I love it! I was skeptical because of all the hype about it, but I've found that I actually look forward to getting up and doing this. I'm learning some self-defense moves, as well. Billy Blanks is a great motivator!"
4,Fun & Challenging,"It's hard to get the hang of at first, but once you do it is fun and challenging. You will see results if you stick with it, but you need to combine it with some other form of exercise like yoga or pilates to get long and lean muscles. This is important especially for women."
1,Get this thing off the market!,I found this video to be extremely boring... I don't care if shaq or Carmen Electra are doing this... It stinks. Where's the plot line? I mean seriously. I found this in the action section in my video store. Billy Blanks is by far the worst actor I've seen in my whole career as a film maker. Don't waste your money. Don't waste your time. Rent a Martin Scorsese movie instead.
3,good but better ones out there now,There's so much to choose from now that I'm sure there are better ones out there. These are high impact - not for the frail or weak for sure!
4,A great video workout,"I live in a college dorm, and we basically from Sunday thru Thursday use it to do our workouts. Many may complain that it is only a 27 min workout, but hey we just rewind it and start over. I think it has increased the idea of excercising in the dorms throughout our college. Which I think is the number one reason of this videos popularity. The camera man focused too much on people's faces than on the bodies."
2,not for most people,"While this tape (basic) can make someone sweat there is too much potential for harm. I have been training in a martial art for seven years (I hold a brown belt) and I cannot believe that someone without any formal training could possibly do these moves correctly without an instructor present to help them. Repeated attempts at doing these movements can and will injure many people's knees, ankles, and lower backs. Tae-bo will NOT teach anyone self defense, it will merely teach you enough to get yourself into trouble. If it's defense you want to learn, sign up for a real martial arts class. If you know some martial arts and how to do the stances already, but need someone to suggest which moves to do in reps, ask your sensei."
2,I would like to have a nickel for every tape they have sold.,"I can't believe all the 5 and 4 star ratings. Obviously the people who love this tape have not seen any exercise vidoes in the last decade. There is no warm up to speak of, improper and poor cueing, poor choice of music that drowns out the audio and boy do they sweat. I feel taken. I have been doing exercise videos for the last 5 years and seen quite a difference in styles and production quality. This one has to be one of the worst. The workout may be fun but it is short and not the safest - especially for someone who is out of shape. I don't like to endorse major corporations but Billy needs some lessons from the people who produce professionals like Gin Miller. Good luck."
2,This program is over-rated and lacks polish.,"While Tae Bo has potential to be a fun workout, this tape is not particularly worthwhile. The audio quality is poor, making it hard to understand the directions. Many of the class participants don't know what they're doing, making them poor models to demonstrate to others. And as Billy doesn't do many of the moves, how're you supposed to know what to do?As an avid fitness fan, I think Billy could use the help of a qualified exercise physiologist. His taped programs are choppy and lack polish. For my part, I'm going in search of a better instructor."
4,interesting,"The ""Industry"" is always in search of new and different ideas,something to beat boredom, interesting combinations, a different perspective. This qualifies. Not to mention, his warm-up takes one back to the very basic,basic moves, which isn't all bad. New ideas and a fresh veiw."
4,Rated as good - very rough,"This book is VERY, VERY worn out. The price was right, though, and it isn't a core major book that my daughter will keep after she is done the class, so I am OK with it. I have bought many used books and this one probably shouldn't have been sent out this last time to be used."
4,6 college kids in a suburban- and we drove from SC to UT!,"Frommer's Utah was great! we spent the week after christmas skiing at Alta- rated one of the best by Frommer's and i'd have to agree. the second week of our trip we spent in moab, and the book gave great hiking, camping, and driving directions for canyonlands, arches, dead horse state park, natural bridges national monument, and monument valley. what a trip!!!"
3,Classic travel Guide,"All of Frommer's books are good this one is no exception. I did not need the entire state review, and as expected a lot of print went to salt lake and Salt Lake City. I was more interested in the southern portion of the state, which was under reviewed."
4,very good tool set for the price,Some have complained about the wooden chisel storage box. I ordered for the chisels not the box and was surprised that the box arrived intact and is a fine compliment to the chisels. The chisels required a touch up sharpening but all in all this has been a worthwhile purchase.
2,The handle has bent.,"The handle has bent.The handle loosened and fell out.Since it is cheap, is it unavoidable?It was very regrettable."
4,NOT IN STOCK,"Amazon claims this is ""In Stock""I have received 3 delays on the shipment so far and am completely losing my trust in Amazon's claim of ""In Stock"" status for any items! Ridiculous... Did the MFG stop making these or what? I am still keeping my order since I don't have any urgent turning projects that I'm waiting to be able to do with the tools, but it I do find it crazy that this product has a status of ""In Stock"" when it is obviously not true. Amazon - get your act together on this!"
2,Not one of Saul's best,I love John Saul and read a lot of his books but this one was dissappointing. It was very predictable and not as scary as his others. Unless you just read everything by Saul I suggest you pass this one by and get the Homing or the God Project.
2,it ain't shakespeare,"I was going to trash this book, but I've changed my mind. John Saul writes books that fall into that elusive category, the good bad novel. I mean, by halfway through this thing, I recognized that it was bad on a cosmic scale. It has plot holes you could drive a semi through, and dialogue that seems to have been written by pre-schoolers who'd been dosed on acid and forced to read ""Sweet Valley High"" novels. But I still finished the damn thing. Hell, I even read another John Saul novel before I finally learned my lesson. Be warned, this guy makes Stephen King sound like Shakespeare. But he will entertain you, at least until you have time to realize what you've been reading."
2,Printed equivalent of a cheesy horror flick.,"After reading three of this man's books, I come to one conclusion: If Dean Koontz is the poor man's Stephen King, John Saul is the absolute pauper's Dean Koontz. He specializes in ham-fisted emotional manipulation; all three books I read were about children in peril. We're supposed to feel afraid for them simply because they're children -- I was just annoyed at being asked to empathize with 2-dimensional characters.If you get about halfway through this tale of biological manipulation, you'll know how it's going to end. You might miscalculate by underestimating just how hollow and mean-spirited Saul's writing is, but you'll have the basic idea.Better yet, just read the back cover and extrapolate the plot. Since there are no surprises, you'll be close enough to spare you reading the book."
5,Good Undergraduate Reference,"I found this dictionary very useful for my geology, climate, and meteorology classes as an undergraduate."
5,THE BEST VAMP BOOKS EVER!!!!!!!!,"When my friend recommended these books to me, I admit I was a bit skeptic. I read the first book Cirque Du Freak: A Living Nightmare and fell in love. These books make you really wish vampires were real. Darren Shan is an awesome author and makes everything incredibly beleivable. I absolutely LOVE these books."
2,Somewhat overrated,"Maybe it's just because I prefer my vampires and other ""supernatural"" creatures to be, well, supernatural, but I did not see the big appeal to this series. The writing style is juvenile, yet the content isn't very appropriate for younger children. The summary on the back of the book dares compare the story to Anne Rice, but it doesn't even come close, not even in the gore factor. If you're a young adult with mature taste, then I suggest reading something more ""mature""."
2,Didn't care much for it,I read the book after seeing the movie. I really hoped to like it but the writing style was just so-so. I actually stopped reading and picked it back up in spurts. I hope the Dresden Files series is better than this author's series. oh and if you want a really good series read the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon.
5,The Bad Choice,Cirque de freak is about a boy named Darren Shan. He and his friends got two tickets to a freak show. Darren and his friend Steve got the tickets. They go to a freak show and got to see people like madam Octa and the bearded Lady. Steve stays after the show Darren finds out that Steve wants to be a vampire and then his world goes upside down.The slackers
2,Best for very young readers,"Cirque du Freak: A Living Nightmare is the first in another young adult horror series that has been gaining popularity lately. While I typically enjoy young adult fiction, Cirque du Freak is a much younger YA book than I typically read, and I had to stop and remind myself to consider the intended audience very frequently.The story line is slow to build, with most of the action and suspense saved for the end. The writing itself felt a bit clumsy, but once again this could be a product of authorial intention (writing for a young audience). I would certainly recommend the Cirque du Freak series for young readers (age nine or so), but I don't think I'll continue the series myself."
2,A Living Nightmare,"This story begins with two friends trying to get tickets to a show called Cirque Du Freak. At this point things get scary. I don't recommend this book because two friends get the tickets to the show. the mom and dad said no, because the show ran too late, even though the parents said no the two boys still went. One of the friends got bit by a vampire, and the boy must do the vampire's evil deeds, and there is nothing anyone can do to stop it. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone because even with all of the horror, it still is a boring book."
5,AWESOME!!!,I Thought this book was really good. Its ending was awesome and im convinced that i have to buy the sequel!!!! It was creative that the author did not use the old vampire myths and used his own creativity.
2,"A Brilliant Man, But...","Timothy Leary was no doubt a brilliant man. But this book wasn't at all what I expected. It was alright, nothing really to write home about. He proposes some interesting thoughts and observations on death but none of it really appeared plausible. It really hurts me to not give it a higher rating because I really wanted to like it. But for the life of me I couldn't find anything that really stuck out in my mind. Plus a lot of it wasn't even written by Leary and most of the things in it have already been published. It almost appears to be a horrible attempt to cash in on the his death and just through a bunch of stuff from his prior publishings together. But whoever edited this needs to be slapped in the face."
3,they could be better,if you like screaming thrashy vocals over guitar playing then you should like this. their considered metal; but only because of the screaming. their guitars are so weak and alternative style that they get drounded out by the vocals. i'd skip this one
2,A study of style over substance,This book was filled with wonderful photos of the period but is essentially a pretty to look at coffee table book. It is not comprehensive in it's exploration of the style and does not have many examples of furniture to study. For the price l paid it is a disappointing resource to me as a furniture designer.
4,"good for adults, advanced for young kids","I was looking for a video to use in teaching young children about dog helpers and heroes. This one, though beautifully done, did not fit my needs. Its vocabulary level and scope make it better suited as an overview for adults."
3,pretty shoes,"When I got these shoes, they were a bit too high for me. I gave them to my daughter in law who is a model and she enjoys their height. I wouldnt recommend these to women over 40. They are pretty and good color, but not practicle."
3,Picture Placement/Sizing in pages could be better,"The book is mainly all pictures. The only issue is that the pictures weren't cropped properly by the publisher to fit the pages correctly. I understand that as a photographer, one might want a picture a certain size for an effect, but the fact that the pictures are sometimes cut in half within the book pages ruins an otherwise perfect image."
1,Terrible Modulator - A Waste Of Money,I wasted about 110 $ and around 107 Egyptian Pounds to get this device shipped to me in Egypt - and It arrives with no manual - no cables - no power supply - nothing but itself .It took me about 3 hours to try to make this thing work and ALL I get is noise from the speakers and black & white hazzy image . I even spent another 110 Egyptian Pounds buying new cables and F-Type and RG-6 Coaxial cable and stuff from Radio Shack - Zilch .... IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY ..I don't know what shall I do with it - ship it back or throw it in the garbage - not sure - just wasted a bunch of dollars and pounds - worth nothing ...
3,Strange little compilatiion,"Hugo Winterhalter backed many of RCA's top singers on many big hits and many almost-hits, most of which are not to be found here. The compilation consists mostly of instrumentals in an easy-listening vein; even at that, it does not include the well-remembered ""Song Of The Barefoot Contessa"" which charted in 1955. Why not include such sides as Sunny Gale's ""Smile"" or Eddie Fisher's ""Oh My Papa,"" both of which were highly dependent on the Winterhalter backing? Many of the vocal tracks included are very lackluster. For 50s pop completists only."
5,Wonderful message,"I love this book and so does my daughter. While she likes the animals throughout the book and the repitition of the word ""hug"", I like the positive message that it send to our children and families."
3,This is good but not great,"I bought this due to good reviews and great pictures but I have to say, I got bored with it quickly. My daughter just now 3 is just starting to get it."
2,Meh,"Just not as fun as I thought it would be. Cuddly enough, like the title said, but not terribly entertaining in the end. I wish I hadn't bought it new. I should have bought used, and saved the difference."
3,Keepin' It Real,"I have to keep it real on this one. I used to always complain about Ashanti, but yet I have all 3 of her cds because she's always got tight singles that drive me to buy the whole cd. So i'm just going to say that i really don't feel like she's the best singer in the world (except on the accapella interludes she be having on her cds, why can't she sound like that all the time?), but she is a very talented writer and she have the best producers. Technology is amazing, u know. My favorite song on here is definately ""Don't Let Them."" The beat is crazy and lyrics are tight as usual. Sometimes you just can't help but like her no matter how many times you say she can't sing or she can't dance. This is so damn hard to explain. Anyway, I give her 3 stars for lyrics and production. One Love"
3,Only U- Only Hit,"Ashanti has a made a great effort with this album. The track with TI is great, but Only U is the best Ashanti track ever, even the video is amazing. I wish she would put out Dual Discs with the videos and the music. It is sad that the Only U track isnt getting more airplay down South and hasnt had the chance to really get popular. Some of the tracks have a Aaliyah feel to them, and the title of the CD is a Tupac knock off, more originilty would be greatly appreciated, more tracks like Only U, less like Focus. Overall, as always I am an Ashanti fan, but she could have done a little better."
1,I WOULDN'T GIVE ANY STARS IF I COULD,"This album was absolutely the worst and most inefficient waste of time i have ever spent a moment of my life on. Ashanti, from day one, has been an artist that has been nothing but a pretty face (and she's not even that pretty.....). The lyrics are awful, her voice is barely bearable and i think we all could agree that she needs to find a new hobby, besides polluting the ears of America's youth. AMERIE IS SO MUCH HOTTER ANYWAY!!!!!!!!!"
2,I'm back with salvation,"Old Review:Why do I do this to myself? I knew when I first heard ""Only U"", I was gonna get this c.d. and I also knew it would be gyahbage! Ashanti actually thinks she can sing and she she's gonna continue to think that if everyone keeps buying this coaster. That's Right! Her c.d's ain't nothing but to put your drink on.DON'T BUY THIS, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET CIARA INSTEAD.New Review:I apologize for saying that about this child. This album is pretty good. I just had to listen to the whole thing. Ashanti did better with Concrete Rose than Chapter II, but Ashanti is better then both. Give it a chance."
3,The INCredible Ashanti...,"I'm ""Still Down"" for her... A MUST sayShe continues to provide her ""fans"" with quality music, but slacks the in-put of vocal talent as far as that goes.I can still stand to listen to her, she's worth it... (She giving us the best she can, UN-fortunately, I ain't giving this effort more than 3stars for my own liking!"
5,Still Thug' Luv'N Fo My Concrete Rose,"Maaan, This Cd Iz Off The ChainI will Be Back To Xplain,Why...I Give It 5 Starz(...)"
3,Oh No,No i thought this cd was gonna be good but it sure wasn't.Her 1st cd was WAY much better than this cd and the second album.
3,It was iiqht,"This cd is aiiqht. Her debut album will always be her best thouqh. I dont kno wut it is about this cd. I can only listen to it like once nd im done with it. The first sonqs that miqht stand out for new comers is Take Me Toniqht, Every LiL thinq, So Hot, & Turn it up. Favorties wuld have to be those 4. i reccomend to jus burn a copy nd save your money rather then waste it on a couple of iiqht sonqs."
3,~~not bad but not good~~,"well ... this album i would have to say is ashanti at her worst ... i really dont see any difference in music & lyrics ... overall i give it 3 stars ... but its not something i like to listen to everyday ... albums highlights ... only u, focus, and wonderful"
5,Stop Hating!,"Ok, she's back, with a hot new single, a future-platinum cd, and a hot new image. She's hittin the high notes, she's dancing, THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH.....What more can you ask for? The CD is the best this year has had to offer. It's not trying too hard like Usher, it's not the usual, like Beyonce, and it's got it's own style, unlike the rest of the cds released! For the people who downtalk Ashanti, I believe you should have number 16 on repeat (Freedom). It's evident that half of the people really haven't listened to the cd, they just don't like Ashanti. Well, the song FREEDOM is ESPECIALLY for you!"
2,I AM DONE!!!!!,"I GAVE THIS CD 1 STAR BECAUSE I ONLY LIKE TWO SONGS ON THE WHOLE CD. I CANT EVEN GET INTO THE REST OF THE CD. NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I LISTEN TO THE CD I JUST DONT LIKE IT. I ONLY ENJOY THE FIRST TWO SONGS NOT INCLUDING KELLY SONG. I AM SO GLAD SOMEONE DOWN LOADED THIS FOR ME FOR FREE BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE BEEN SO UPSET IF I PAID FOR THIS CD. ASHANTI PLEASE GIVE IT UP. SHE IS A VERY PRETTY WOMAN WHO WOULD DO BETTER HOSTING SOMETHING ON TV (NO, NOT ACTING)JUST HOSTING. I WISH SHE COULD HAVE DELIVERED BETTER. MAYBE SHE IS WORKING WITH THE WRONG PEOPLE. HER VOICE ISN'T SO GREAT BUT SHE COULD BE WORKED WITH. PUFFY COULD PROBABLY GIVE HER WHAT SHE NEEDS. ALSO WHO WRITES HER SONGS??? HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!! WE NEED PERSONAL EXPERIENCES."
1,please stop you suck....,why is this wilderbeast still making crappy music... when i found out that she was coming out with another lackluster... it ruined my life... she is by far the worst artist to ever release any musik she is not original at all.... this thing thinks that [...]please dont buy this $#!+..... [...]
2,What Happend?,"What happend to the Ashanti that was ""Always on Time"" and asked us all ""Whats Love""? Now Ashanti my girl but this cd could have been way way more better. There are only a few songs on here that are actually good. The single""Only You"" was totally hot but the rest of the cd is not. The Best Songs On Here Are: Don't Leave Me Alone & Freedom. People say that she can't sing well she does pretty well because we all bought her cd. I personally wished it was more r&b like the first cd she had. I just think she got a little too comfortable in her own skin not saying that you shouldn't but come on ths cd makes no sence at all. I give it 2 stars she has three songs I like but thats me and my opinion. If you ask me the 1st 2 cd's are way better."
3,Will Study Further,"I wish I knew more about social justice and the context in which West writes. I sense this to be an insightful work by a brilliant man but am not fully able to grasp its profundity.What I get here is that race does indeed matter. Especially in discussions of race. While seemingly obvious, apparently this point is not as commonly accepted or widely appreciated at it seems it would be, or should be.Definitely worth another read at some point."
1,Major disappoint!,"First of all, what was he saying? I couldn't interpret what he meant in his book. I was just reading a bunch of words written down on paper. No disrespect to him but it wasn't worth my time to be reading."
3,Ok,"Ok product for the price --- lots of little pieces and I underscore little.Wy must I type 6 more words to accommodate your ""guidelines"" --- what a great way to discourage feedback !"
1,Disappointed!,"I was highly disappointed when this toy arrived. First of all the prices is way to much for what you get - although sealed as if it was new, one of the bottle food jars came without a lid and all the stickers assembled were crooked and overlapping. It was very poorly put together and missing pieces. The picture makes the pieces look like higher quality and larger than actual scale. I do not recommend purchasing this product unless the price is dropped significantly."
2,it is not same every package!,"i got it yeaterday!there r no bottle warmer,the spoon and fork is differentthe duck is uglyno spong for bathdon t have time to return it."
2,Not recommended,Reminds me of Uno...but not. Makes no sense and I would not recommend it. My grandkids didn't like it either.
3,mildly fun,"This game is decent. The passing hands aspect is unique, and the rules are simple. However, the rules are so simple, and the strategy so blah, that it gets old quickly.Old fashioned slap-jack, PIT, or Egyptian War will have more staying power than Swap."
2,Just OK....,"Don't buy this for the remixes... only if you don't already own ""Up Up Up Up Up Up""... or perhaps as a gift. I gave this to my dad for father's day. The remixes aren't any different than the real song. But... it is a beautiful song."
5,Detailed guidance for the new machinist / AR builder,"As a novice machinist I had no idea where to start working on my forging. This DVD does an exceptional job of walking beginners through the tool selection, setup, and operations.The author also does a great job of explaining the reasoning behind his actions. Even if you never build an AR forging, you can learn a lot about milling just by watching.This is an invaluable addition to my gunsmithing library and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in building their own rifle from scratch."
5,not this one,"this copy only downloads a little over half of book. last few chapters missing. this is the free copy. dont know if its an accident but i tried to order again to see and since i already have this copy, cant"
4,Another great MxPx CD,This is a great bonus to all the other MxPx CD's you already have. The acoustic version of Chic Magnet is lots of fun and the rest of the CD is great as well. Make sure you listen to it more than once because it really grows on you.
2,Not the original stories.,"I was disappointed to find that these are not the stories as originally published (as they seem to purport to be). Changes have been made in the text to match the changes for the U.S. television series (""trucks"" to ""freight cars"", Sir Topham Hatt, etc.) It is very frustrating when publishers feel they need to change something that was so great to begin with. The original illustrations are here and are great, but I'd suggest finding an older copy of the book or a collection with the author's original text if you are really interested in the Thomas stories as they were originally published."
2,Anti - Thomas,"Is it OK to say that you don't like TTTE? There is no denying that kids have been captivated by the Thomas phenomenon, including the mass merchandising of toys and every conceivable household accroutrement - from lampshades to bedspreads, toothbrushes to curtains...overpriced clothing ranges...mainly on the strength of the TV series and the BBC/ABC marketing arms.But, but, but, but....I find the stories twee, dated and humourless. So dour...so class-ridden... I know millions will disagree, and there are millions of happy kids and parents out there.Thomas was a passing phenomenon in our household, and there's nothing wrong with a bit of stodge mixed in with more nutritious fare. I wouldn's say ""don't go there"", but try to retain some perspective and balance in children's lives!"
4,Apple tea,"Although the product was not exactly what I was looking for, it is a very good bargain for a custom blended tea. It does have a very pleasant taste. I would recommend the company I bought it from and the product to others. Shipping was very fast and affordable."
1,Improperly Titled,"This book should be called ""Sketches of Mucha"". Most of these are just the rough work up of completed works. Look inside the book before buying. Choose ""Surprise Me"" to get a better look at the book."
5,Brilliant and witty,"I read the Duane Humphries translation. His preface is superbly written, so one would hope that his translation possesses similar flair. Since I don't read Latin, I cannot attest to his accuracy.He observes in his preface the commonalities between Ovid's scene and that of our contemporary world. You will get a strong sense of a society that was very similar to that of our own."
3,Amazing,"This book is beautifully translated (actually, transliterated, as the original is immediately adjacent)from the Latin. The translator painstakingly even strove to make many of the lines rhyme which is more than Ovid did in the original! But what is truly amazing to me (call me naive!) is the currency of the advice. Ovid could be sitting in a NY bar today: reading his advice won't give away the date it was written.It's a quick and easy read - if this kind of thing interests you, I highly recommend it.And, you know, it's always fun to compare notes with another guy, right? (PS, Ovid was straight)."
5,Purely great comfort reading,"Haven Kimmel is in the same class as Frank McCourt, only a little more upbeat. She invites you into her heart and mind (both 'Couch' and 'Zippy') with disarmingly goofy cover pictures of herself, and procedes to dazzle with witty phrase-turning and episodes that are instantly familiar and immediately unforgetable.There is a reason this writer has written two successful memoirs before reaching middle age. She is fantastic. She writes in the voice of a child but with the wisdom of an accomplished literary artist.Note: If you end up with as vivid a picture of Mooreland as I did, you might get a kick out of using Google Earth to actually take you there. It's high definition and you can practically see her on her bike heading over to her sister's house."
5,AWSOME!,This baby doll is very cute and is a good value. she is the first baby doll i had ever LOVED! i also like that she comes with a diper too. (because it's hard to find some that fits them.) so i would garentee that your kids will absaloutly love this baby doll.
4,Pretty Good little CD,"Shows some growth as a band and as persons. Daring to dabble more in what they really want to do... make music, not just to fill an image, or fit a scene. I had contact with these guys for a while and got to know Karen Personaly. She is great, as a fellow musician, I would say she is capable of great things. The rest of the band is cool too. Corey has some great talent, as does Onyx. The album spans a wide verity or emotions and subjects, just as our lives do. I look forward to some new material, and wish there was a way I could get in contact with em again.~Infinite-T"
2,Flawed Fun,"The first thing you will notice when you fire up QuickSpot is that the menu is very irritating. You must circle the buttons rather than tap them. The game, however, is quite fun for about 20 minutes. It's interesting how it is very hard to see a very obvious change in two pictures. The presentation is well done and the artwork is good, if not overly cute and anime.If it was a free game on the internet, I would have played it the same amount of time as I did when it was in my DS. I can't recommend this unless you have several kids, each of which will get an hour out of it in the car on vacation.Pros: Good presentation and art. Interesting concept for a game.Cons: Lack of depth. Irritating menu activation through circling buttons. Cute anime art."
1,Is This A Pregnancy Book Or A Tribute To Alan Thicke?,"His book rambles on and on. He talks about his life in Hollywood, his trophy wife and the Miss America pageant, renovating his guest house, his birth place in Canada, his teenage kids and a lot of other drivel. Where is the info about having a baby? Occassionally he'll touch on some pregnancy things but he jumps around so much it's hard to follow. If you're interested in Alan Thicke's life buy the book if you're interested in pregnancy from a guy's perspecitive forget it!"
5,Great album!!,"This album is fantastic! While their sound as definitely matured over the years, this is the Old 97's at their most raw and energetic. Its got an early version of Four Leaf Clover, which just blows me away every time I listen to it. Highly recommended!"
3,Not terribly interesting,"I have kept an extremely informal journal for about 12 years now, and was looking to expand into the realm of real writing... This book would not be my very first suggestion for someone in a similar situation.Honestly, her writing reminded me a bit of a professor I had that thought her writing was far more instructive and valuable than it truly was. I have no doubts at all about her sincerity and zeal for the subject of journaling, and some of the journal entries from the other writers were inspiring in their own way, but I struggled through her metaphors. Other reviewers have said 'a bit wordy' and I agree. Nothing terrible, I just wasn't as inspired as the title had led me to hope for."
5,every woman should read this book,This author meant to make a change in the lives of women in the middle east. This book is a wake-up call to all women all over the world. it is not only for middle east women. You will understand how men think through this book written by this pioneer psychologist.
4,Works great with the HF100,Pros. Works as advertised gives you twice the field of view. You can now film and take pictures in small rooms. Very low price.looks good on the camera. Mic an flash not blocked by lens. Comes with covers for both parts of the lens. Along with a small bag for storage.Cons. With the lens on the camera it has problems focusing on maximum zoom.
5,Nice lense for the price,"Bought this for my Canon FS100, could have spent more and gotten a better lense, I guess... but for my purposes - its perfect."
4,good starter kit,"good starter kit for the melvins,after 25 or more years of making records the melvins have covered a lot of ground.that being said,each era of the melvins has a somewhat different sound and style,still heavey rock at it`s core,these 3 are a good start. if your into metal you can get the maggot,nude with boots, and a senile animal also.if you like the heavy grunge thing you might get bullhead,eggnog.there is alot of variety,these are the more metalish discs,there are about 50 more melvins discs so do your research,you never know what you might get when you put a melvins disc on."
2,Should have stayed a secret.,"This book does well when it illuminates certain facts about the Bard's life. For example, it establishes a probable direct link between Campion and Shakespeare. However, the conclusions it draws about some of the plays are among the worst drivel ever turned out about Shakespeare. Not only are the author's insights stretched to the point of being ridiculous, he does not attempt to connect them to the larger themes of the plays. In discussing Macbeth, for example, he claims that Shakespeare uses the witches' patter to project an image of anti-Catholicism, but does not try to tie this in with the larger theme of excessive ambition. For analysis of the plays, try Frank Kermode, A.L. Rowse, Goddard or Harold Bloom."
4,"Take what works, leave the rest.","This book made me review the way I've been dealing with my self-image and weight and how I can make some changes. Like 12-steppers say, take what you need and leave the rest. As a food addict, carrying a bag of food around with me and filling my cabinets with binge food is not a good idea -- for me. However, I have stopped dieting, and I'm learning to eat and exercise like a real human being who is living a real life instead of SOMEONE WHO MUST BE THIN BY NEXT THURSDAY. I highly recommend this book. Just be sure to take your own addictions into account and make adjustments when needed. These authors do make some very valid and important points."
1,Not what I expected,I got this product in the mail yeasterday. I was so excited to open and then I saw the box. The package was very cheap. But I guess that's what you get for $3.00. The hand itself is not hard it's rubber. I will definetly be returning this and I don't think you should buy this.
1,Unrealistic and Shallow,"This book was a pretty big waste of time. It revolved way too much around teenage boy horniness (the main character, musician Toby, constantly envisions Sarah in rather explicit and degrading ways) and had very little context of what real human beings with substantial emotions include. These characters were shallow and ignorant, and the main conflict was extremely ridiculous. I do not recommend this as a good teen read by any means. Choose something more realistic and valuable to enjoy, such as any of Sarah Dessen's young adult novels."
2,Corny and Predictable,"I knew from the reviews that this book was about a high school relationship so I had my doubts. I guess I just didn't expect it to be so predictable. I was irritated by how corny and one dimensional everything was.Girl dates popular jock; realizes that he is an egotistical jerk with jerk friends; girl dumps him for misfit boy who has been trying to work his way into girl's heart; everything is wonderful and dandy; big secret comes out and crumbles the happy couple; they make up and live happily ever after.It was an alright book but was too typical and superficial for me. Nothing different or excited happened. It wasn't a unique teen relationship story but rather a safe, ho-hum one."
5,Best Book Ever,This book is really something else. I read it in less than two days. The characters are beautiful and wonderfully portrayed. This is a must read.
2,Don't bother,"This book was in the library window at my school, so I thought it would be good. I was even bummed I wasted the time checking it out at the library. I'm glad I didn't buy it."
3,"light-hearted pretension, but at least it ends pessimistically","This is a coming of age film about getting it while on vacation. Some people are too serious and gushing sincerity, some stupid and self-deluding, some simply lustful and selfish. Pauline observes it all and grows, in my view acting more maturely than the adults. And the ending is realistic. There is nothing slick about Rohmer's production, and I never particularly liked his style and pedantic philosophical monologues, which the French really DO indulge in, in my humble experience. This uncompromising search for true love is endemic with the French I know, and I admit it bores me after having dealt with it for many years. You really can learn from this, at least about French culture, if not how to fall into healthy love. That makes this a pretty good film and it has some funny and unexpected twists. And the end is wonderfully un-Hollywood."
2,Hmm ... not so much,"I'm a Crowes fan, but don't like this one. I guess I miss the searing guitars and riffs. Looking forward to ""Warpaint"" in March."
4,Nice gift for the nieces,I shipped this straight to my twin nieces so I am rating based on what their mom told me. It was a good educational gift for Christmas.
4,A LOVELY SURPRISE,"Just looking at the title of this book, I rolled my eyes sourly and thought, ""why would anyone give me this overly-precious book?"" Not wanting to judge a book by its title, I began reading and was immediately hooked. What a lovely surprise: the author takes the viewpoint of a housecat and what life must be for a pet who was orphaned, was found and lived through the ups and downs of his loved-ones' lives.This is a clever, simple, funny and, ultimately, very moving story of learning to live for today...and, of course, learning to love."
1,Oxybenzone,"I also bought this product based upon the EWG rating and, having just received it today, was likewise horrified to find that it contains oxybenzone, vitamin A, as well as a litany of other ingredients which I was specifically trying to avoid, especially when paying a premium price. Obviously, they changed their formulation since EWG purchased theirs. There are better options, like Vanicream and Purple Prairie, which I also ordered."
3,Bad for acne,"Yes, in my 40's with acne. This stuff makes it worse. Otherwise, it is fine sunblock. I plan to use it on my arms and legs."
3,It's OK,"Pros:*Broad spectrum SPF 30 from zinc oxide*No ""chemical"" sunscreens*Fragrance-free*Didn't irritate my sensitive skinCons:*Kinda smells*Greasy & runny*The spray-application didn't work as well as I hopedSo it's an OK sunscreen. The list of ingredients is fine and it does the job, but I didn't like it and won't buy it again. I recommend BurnOut SPF 30+ KIDS instead (it's my current favorite) or the sunscreen from Loving Naturals."
2,"Great ingredient list, terrible product","I purchased this sunscreen, like many others, because it looked to be about the best value among the sunscreens that are considered to be the safest from an ingredients list standpoint. This sunscreen passes muster on the ingredient list but the practical application just plain stinks. The product is impossible to evenly apply leaving white clumps with every application. Considering that there are many, many products that have just as safe a rating, you should avoid this one until they can improve their formula."
4,Gets me every time,"I have watched this movie 3 times. Once with no subtitles, once with the english subtitles, and lastly again without subtitles. I'm sure I'll watch it again. This film is very good, but especially if you have experienced your youth, or adulthood in a similar situation.*Potential Spoiler*The scene toward the end when the husband confronts the wife after seeing the coaster, when frederique screams, ""je me tuerai!"" Its very difficult to watch, but probably the best scene in the film.A great film, althought serious in nature, could be viewed by the whole family. I recomend though, if you dont understand french you probably wont appreciate the film as much."
5,Perfect for unwinding in the tub,"I have had this book since it came out in 2005, I have read it off and on whenever the mood strikes me in between novels. It's just a great book, I read a story or two during a bath. If you like real stories by real women then this book will be great for you. Purchasing another copy for my aunt for Christmas."
2,please look at other options before you buy this camera,"I am fed up with this camera. My parents bought it for me because i have a Gateway computer and they wanted to make sure that my digital camera would be compatible with my computer.I'll just make this short and sweet.1 : McGyver couldn't figure out how to turn this camera on.2 : Expect to miss a lot of potentially great shots, because the start up screen stays on unnecessarily long.3 : Expect blurry shots for the first 2 weeks of using it.4 : If you buy a large memory card, you computer will start freaking out whenever you plug the USB into it.5 : If you plug it into a new G5, your pictures may get erased.6 : Customer Service at Gateway won't help.Just get something else. It will save you from so much frustration and anger in the long run."
1,buyer beware,"horrible camera. experianced everything said above. i am now actually looking for anyone who still has the box so i can send this hunk of crap back. (...) it would be greatly, GREATLY appreciated and i'll try to do something nice in return."
2,Don't buy this camera,"This camera is only compatible with Gateway brand USB cables. If you happen to lose your USB cable then you are out of luck because Gateway does not sell the cable alone. I don't understand why Gateway doesn't sell replacement parts for its own camera, especially since no other brand works. Curiously, this problem didnt seem at all interesting to the 4 different Gateway employees I spoke with."
3,NOT true fisheye but wide angle is okay,This is not a true fisheye lens. The wide angle is okay but you get some vignetting. The construction of the lens feels solid but it is as good as a curved piece of glass will get. (you get what you pay for)
3,"Engaging story, frustrating execution","I agree with some of the other reviewers that this game had potential, but the frustration level nearly outweighed any fun I experienced playing it. I love adventure games, so I tolerated the problems enough to finish it; but I can say I was glad when it was over.The biggest problem was navigation--the cursor would indicate you could move off screen only 1/2 the time you actually could. This is misleading, and I don't enjoy games that force me to try things at random or run about aimlessly in order to determine exactly what they expect me to do. For example, at one point you need to pick up some sand. You're on a beach, so it's all around you. But of course you have to click in an exact spot to do it! Tedious.I still think this game is worth playing, because of the engaging story (similar to Syberia 1 & 2), but be sure to have one or two walk-throughs handy."
1,Buyer Beware,"Be sure to read all the reviews before you buy this program (I wish I had). It may be as fun as some people claim, I don't know. I couldn't get past the first scene. I would walk a few steps, and then my computer would crash. Over and over again. I tried all the fixes recommended (not by the developers, but by other annoyed and frustrated users) and nothing worked. I have a relatively new XP machine that exceeds all game requirements. Don't waste your money on this turkey."
1,Wouldn't even load = Video problems,"I have a very state-of-the-art computer with all the accelerated video, drivers, sound, etc that is needed to run any game., with all the drivers kept up to date. This game wouldn't even load and kept crashing the system, even to the ""blue screen"" of dumping physical memory. I ran all patches, changed video modes, changed compatibility modes and nothing would work. If that's any indication of what's left for problems if it ever runs, check out the other reviews of those who actually got it to work...lots of problems. What a shame such a promising game ended up such a waste."
2,"Interesting, but not that exciting","I enjoyed this DVD as a relatively new Led Zeppelin fan. It was interesting hearing about the band and how they came to be, but I would have liked to have heard from the 4 geniuses themselves. A little blurb here and there of past interviews was good, but it would have been better to hear from them present day. We didn't get to hear any of their music and that was unfortunate. A little bit of history to this great band, but lacking in content."
4,Rock's Golden Age,"Although there was no direct input from the Zeps in the making of this DVD, it is still an interesting and enjoyable one to watch. There was plenty of footage I had not seen before, and I loved the interviews with Lori Maddox and Pamela des Barres!"
5,Great for floppy ears!,I have a boxer with floppy ears and she had problems with ear yeast infections. I tried the vets recommendations but nothing seemed to help her. I put a sprinkle in her ears every 3-4 days and her ear problems are totally gone!! I'm sure it would be great for grooming too :)
1,Don't waste your money,I got this harness to go in a 1995 Nissan Maxima to save time. Not only was the harness not wired correctly it was made of poor quality components
2,I haven't made it through the entire video yet.,I think having a dancer background would have helped. The first warm up steps were very difficult to begin (waving your arms around in the air) and so I just quit and didn't go any further with it.If you have some sort of formal dance training it would have helped.I may try it again in a while.
1,Very poor book,"Donald Read is Reuters' ""official"" historian. It is clear in this dull and pointless book that being their ""pet"" is a position that he is completely happy with. Not for him the ivory towers of serious academic research, instead he churns out company ideology intermingled with inconsequential detail. Ever wonder what happens to 2nd rate historians? Well now you know- at least the university system doesn't have to support his banal ponderings. Why on earth a company like Reuters would want to bother with this sort of stuff (or kind of guy) is beyond me."
5,Excellent,"Didn't really need to read the book, as having been in 'the profession' the truth of what Judge Molloy conveys hit me on a daily basis, and eventually left after eight years. The 'politicking' in the courts is abominable, and the public and justice not being served on any level.Well writen, and as an Arizona especially appreciated his 'take' on the Arizona judiciary and his experiences most of all."
5,A message of love,"""LOVE LETTERS FROM GOD has the ability to heal those in need and inspire those who are searching for a way"""
5,Brilliant,"This book is incredable ! I had to get rid of my preexisting exercise beliefs. Getting fitter, stronger and more flexible in 2 x 12 mins a day !! Not posssible(or so I thought) After a week I feel like a new man, I'm 48 and out of shape. I've tried exercising at the gym, biking, walking but I kept setting my self up to fail, by trying to do what I could in my youth. I am stronger, flexible and feel fantastic and optomistic than I have been for years, after only a week ! I actually wake up and look forward to the exercises and I do them before I go to bed. A HUGE thank you to Taylor and Joanna.Mike"
4,A view of the company - through the years,"The book walks the reader through an officer's career from the highs to the lows. the book outlines the positives and negatives of life as an officer - it also explains that in many instances, taking a step backward in your career many times is how you get forward. Floyd's career was nothing short of stellar.If you are at all interested in the art or service of espionage - this is aa must read."
1,Wouldn't hold a charge,"I use my Dremel on a weekly basis to keep my dog's nails short. I have never used it for anything else, so I would say it gets light use, at best.I bought this battery to replace the original battery for my Dremel that stopped holding a charge. I charged the new battery fully before I used it the first time and would allow it to fully drain before I charged it again, but like the battery that came with my Dremel it stopped holding a charge after a few months. My hope was to avoid having to buy a whole new Dremel, but that's what I eventually ended up doing. This battery was a total waste of money."
1,Question.....,"WHY NO CONCERT OF THEM ANYWHERE????????? Videos,Documentarys,all this ""Stuff"" and not a full length concert ANYWHERE!!! WHY????"
2,not recommended,"Although the short tales are written using a well crafted English they do not say anything. English is my second language and I was hoping to learn more about classic american literature. I was disappointed because there is not a single good story in all the classics. It's just well detailed descriptions of mundane tales. For example mark twain talks about a tax guy who moved to a new town and end up auditing the narrator, or Jack London going on and on about a guy trying to build a fire in a freezing cold area. If you are looking for highly predictable stories with no surprises and complex English you will like it. On the other hand if you want to hear a very good story with lots of twists or unfolding elements, none of them will have it."
2,Stories very old...will not keep you awake.,"Stories were old and not very interesting. I almost did not finish listening to the entire set, but nothing else on the radio where I was driving."
5,Wonderful playing!,"To put it quite simply, I don't think you can go wrong with this complete set. I like this as much as Bolet's, but this set is complete. Berman takes a more ""virtuosic"" approach to these pieces, while I think Bolet plays them a bit slower and more poetic. I found no problems with the sound at all. Great set for sure."
4,Get buy great product,"These napkins are large, thick, high quality, They retain their color and shape after washing. They do not need ironing. All around fabulous buy!"
2,Not worth your money.,"I thought this book was going to be more about an insightful philosophy. But instead, over half deals with Mitchell's experience as an astronaut and his personal life. Mitchell claims to have a magic recipe - a ""dyadic model"", which is the thoughtful merger of science and spirituality. I thought it would make an adequate inclusion of spirituality, but instead, the author examines certain mystical phenomena and promptly claims to take the truth from each...in his own fashion, and then retorts that such and such people's view about the event...many of its interpretations, were wrong. This is not a merger of science and spirituality, it is taking all the meat from a spiritual body and just leaving the bones. This debases and is insulting to many spiritual and cultural traditions throughout the world. This is just a propaganda for Mitchell's own particular, quasi atheist view of reality, and one that serves to finance his institute."
1,Poor instruction...,"This book tries to cover too much and doesn't explain much of anything in detail. My college instructor didn't like the book. My tutor didn't like the book. As far as I can tell, no one thought this book was worth the paper it was written on. I had a very difficlut time following the material. If you have to take a college algebra class, pray this is not the book that is required!"
3,Disappointing,"Having devoured other good reads by Jane Smiley I really looked forward to this book. Historical fiction is a favorite of mine, especially about the American West but I found this book very boring and depressing. Lydie never succeeds at a single thing - she loses her home, her husband, her horse, her baby. She fails at her attempt to resettle in K.T., she fails to rescue a slave, she alienates her friends, family and those that try to help her. You end the book thinking her life was a waste. I was also disappointed at the factual detail ad nauseum of the conflict between the abolitionists and the Missourians. The story became completely mired down in this conflict without proving a thing. If I hadn't been so determined to finish it (hoping for it to get better) I would have quit before part two. Ms. Smiley does write beautifully, hence the three stars but I honestly wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, unless they needed help getting to sleep."
2,I expected better from Ms. Smiley,"Jane Smiley is one of my favorite authors (I adored A Thousand Acres). However, this was a huge disappointment. I never could get into the book...it took me almost 2 months to finish. I never got a handle on Thomas: why he married Lidie, was he wise or weak, etc. Despite being written in the 1st person as Lidie, I never understood her either. I came close several times to throwing it aside without finishing, but persevered to the end. Smiley's historical depiction was good, but it didn't seem to flow well with her characterizations."
3,Great resource book,"Snoring Can Kill is very informative about the cause and dangers of sleep apnea. It includes a detailed description of the sleep study. Goldstein said ""There are safe and effective medical solutions readily available to help a person stop snoring."" However, no safe and effective solutions were offered. Suggested treatments have been proven to not be very successful. This book is a good resource book for sleep centers, respiratory therapists and the Sleep Disorders Dental Society members."
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH VERIZON RAZR V3C!!,"The product description should state that it does not work with the Verizon V3C! When plugged in, it states ""Unauthorized Charger"" and will not charge at all (although, if the battery is dead, it will give you enough juice to speak, but it still won't charge(?))."
1,Piece OF Crap,"I have a Verizon MOtorola Razr V3 and when connected to the phone it gave the message ""Unidentified Charger"" and would not charge up the battery on the phone. The charger, when compared to a Verizon charger, looked to be exactly the same as far as the connector. This may work for other Razr phones, however it was a waste of time for me my guess is largely in part to the face that Verizon screws you on everything they can, so why not now on aftermarket accessories for phones they dont even make..."
1,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,I should have known from the cost of the charger that I should not have made the purchase. It worked for a few days and now it doesn't work AT ALL.Do not waste your time on this charger. Invest a little more in something that will work long term.
1,Purchase from 27macropolohaus,"The book was described as being in new condition. The book arrived March 30, 2011. The book was very well packaged.1. The book had had one page removed.2. The book has a somewhat dirty cover.3. The book has some specks on the edging.A new book should not have these problems.On March, 31, 2011, at about 12:15 A. M., I began a draft to the seller. As far as I know, no reply was sent, but perhaps my reply was not received as I do not know how to send electronic mail very well.I AM NOT SATISFIED. PLEASE HELP.Thank you.Respectfully,James Yost"
1,Failed,"My first unit quit within one week and I exchanged it for a new one. While this is supposed to be ""silent"" the fans are noisy and increase in noise over time, after which the unit stops working. I'm past the year warranty now, so it goes to a landfill. It's criminal to make a major appliance that has to go to the landfill in 12 months. Avoid this product."
1,Looks great but is not made to last & will break for sure!,"This product is terrible, wish we listened to the poor reviews we read elsewhere that were right on the money. Basically this unit lasts for about 6 months. After that the fan starts getting louder and louder till it ceases to work. That's it. If you buy this item don't say you weren't warned because you're in for a surprise."
1,Haier Wine Cooler,"Bought a Haier 6 bottle cooler about 15 months ago. It quit shortly thereafter and I exchanged it for a newer model, same size. It worked fine for 5 or 6 months, then one day I found it not working and my wine warm. I contacted Haier and gave them the info I had but could not find the sales receipt. After a couple of months, I just forgot about it until I re-discovered it in my garage and took the back off thinking a fuse may have blown. No re-movable fuses found. I'm just out the money and a couple of bottles of wine that spoiled. Would not buy or recommend a Haier product, poor performance, poor Customer Service. I have a Haier mini fridge, I'm sure it won't last as well.Ray HodgeHighland Village, TX."
1,dissapointment!,"Nice unit, except function and durability. Paid $155 at Lowe's 15 months ago. I thought at first it should be getting cool faster, but must be the technology used. For white wine, must be set on maximum cool, which means the fans never stop running, and are not that quiet. Month 15, noticed my wine was warm. Found lower inside fan encased in ice behind the panel. Removed the panel, thawed the ice, and let dry. Surprising, the fan still works, but I have been running it for two days and can't get it below 50 degrees. Would like 40, but would settle for low 40's. Looks like it will go to the dump and I'll have to look for better quality in another brand."
1,Stef's Review,My earrings were defective. The metal is thin and one of the diamonds had a HUGE scratch down the middle. I sent them back for a refund. Amazon was great about refunding my money.
1,"Wordy, horid as a reference","I had to use this book in a class that i was in, and i did not find this book useful at all. The book is so verbose it is hard to read and understand, with the index it is impossible to find topics, and coverage of topics are spoty so it is not a good reference book. It is very specific to the architecture, and uses IDEAL mode exclusively, which is cumbersome when MASM is also a desired mode to learn."
2,Acquired taste maybe?,Got this when I read that it was jam packed full of vitamin B6. Read reviews of people who adore this product. I can liken it to eating a very very concentrated worchestershire sauce - almost tasty but way too salty. I'll keep trying but so far I really can't join the fan club. Wish I could tho.
4,"Great bag, dont love the color","This is a great set, i LOVE it! But the color is not how it looks in the picture, it is almost a neon green, very bright! While it is a fun color, you definitely wont lose it, i was hoping for a more neutral color. I am going to exchange it for a different color."
2,Steroid heroes ?,"Apparently rushed into print to take advantage of the chemically-fueled Sosa/McGwire home run race. Fine photos, but lacks any analysis at all. Not up to the high standard set by SI."
1,Was sent wrong product,Cant say if I like it since I received the wrong thing. Got a straight handle instead of the curved handle.
2,Buy something else,"The 45 sec. skip protection is a joke. It skips just sitting the unit down. No battery display, only tells you when it is low, really, really low. When you stop it wont restart at the exact place you left off. The unit will only restart at the begining of the track you left off at. Not good it its a really long track."
5,Dennis the Menace,Classic family show in the setting in the 1950's. Story line of a young boy who gets in and out of one problem after another great family show
5,"Great Show, Brings back memories",If you grew-up watching Dennis the Menace now is the chance to re-live thoseold days where everything was much simplier. Loads of fun. I watched all of season one over the pastyear now I am watching season two. Great Comedy.
2,Beware when ordering perfume online!,"I was definitely reeled into this purchase by the low price of my favorite perfume. Unfortunately, when I received the perfume I was immediately thrown off. I've been using Chance by Chanel for a while now and the bottle just looked slightly off. When I tried using the spray it smelled like a totally different perfume.Luckily, I got a full refund quickly and easily, which is why I gave this item 2 stars instead of 1.You should only buy perfume from department stores or licensed vendors. Otherwise you run the risk of buying a product that is not authentic, and that may include chemicals that are bad for your skin."
2,Learn from my mistake,"You may look at the Bantam Classics edition of Aristophanes and think ""Wow, what a deal! All eleven extant plays by Aristophanes for under $6!"" I thought the same thing; but trust me, this edition is not worth your time. These translations are stilted, archaic and endlessly frustrating - obscuring not only the timeless humor of the plays, but occasionally the basic elements of the plot as well. I recommend instead paying the extra money for the livelier, bawdier, more readable Penguin editions. Don't make the same mistake I did."
5,Another Peter Green.,"Another Peter Green classic, I have liked all the cds Peter has bought out lately, I love the backing singers and his voice is great."
3,ego disco,Required for Latin course I am taking. Find the course and this book difficult to process. They claim it is laid out as you would need to use for reference in first two chapters. I find it difficult to find clarification of word form in this format.
4,Great for the Halloween night!!!,"Great music, exclusively music from the movies. I used it to scare off the kids at night when treak-or-treatin. Only the classics included!!!"
3,bounty hunters,the movie was just ok. this is not the best action movie that i have seen but does have action
5,Trish Stratus is the star of the movie,Trish Stratus is the star of the movie thats why I bought it is kinda corny at times & lots of 4 letter words but overall its a good movie & Trish Stratus is the star
2,The author's feminist viewpoint keeps getting in the way!,"This book was not bad and could have been good. The problem is that the author seems to view all of the archetypes through a feminist lens. This stands out over and over again as she describes various archetypes. In fact, she states that if a character follows the Masculine journey and does not take the feminine path of decent, then the character should fail in his journey. I will probably be able to filter useful information from this book, but found it frustrating to read."
5,Freestyle to the MAX!,"This is a must have for ALL Freestyle fans. It is all by the original artists. I wouldn't exactly pull out the cardboard and start break dancing, its not for that. But it will keep you on your feet for hours...."
4,Great CD 4 Freestyle Fans!,"If you are a fan of freestyle, this compilation ois for you! I didn't know what to expect from it cause there were no Customer reviews here, but It's worth every cent. It has all the songs that make me wanna put on my warm-ups and slid eout the cardboard and start breaking!HIGHLY RECOMENDED!"
2,Not What I Expected!,"A typical war story. While readable, it doesn't stack up to Flags of Our Fathers and Indestructible, Jack Lucas, Medal of Honor."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this book because I had been told that reading erotica might spice up my bedroom life with my husband (married twelve years and two kids - need I say more?). This was a let-down on all fronts. First of all the majority of the stories are lesbian, which is totally fine, but I'm not a lesbian and therefore those stories really didn't do much for me. The other issue I had was that they are clearly written by people who were sexually active in the '70's. Which although good for a laugh, not so great at spicing up the bedroom life. I would have to give this book a big thumbs down. Sorry!"
1,Did not work and requires add'l equipment.,"Out of hot water in apt building (only luke warm water) and thought this would be perfect temp fix. Saw all the videos of stores that sell it singing high praises for this thing because it is supposedly easy to install and effective. Turns out that's not the case. Yes it's easy to install if you happen to have a shower pipe that just sticks straight out (most people have ones that bend down) and you happen to have a 30amp plug about a foot above your shower head (chord is super short). These two things are really rare so be prepared for an install to include buying a super heavy duty extension (10 guage is what my electrician recommended which happends to be quite expensive - don't use cheaper extension because he said it would cause major damage) and since the device needs to be absolutely upright need to buy buy shower elbows etc. to angle it properly. Anyways, all that extra trouble and then the thing DID NOT work!!!!"
4,Unforgettable,"If you believe in aliens but not in God, Then you ""must"" see this movie! IT might just change your mind, and cause you to think about where you're going when you die!"
5,A great R&B album,I think that this album is really great.It has a lot of up tempo songs and all the beats are really Great. My favorite song would have to be So Pretty. I think that B5 is a gret group and they are all talented singers
1,B5,"Is it just me, or does it seem a wee bit suspcious that B5 has about 300 5 star reviews? I believe someone had a lot of time on their hands and posted about 250 times...but whatever. Anyway I listened to the whole CD online and these boys can really sing but I'm a bit old to be a fanatic. I was just thinking about getting the CD for my little sister for her birthday. I wouldnt buy it for any other reason because I'm really not feeling it. Not that it's bad music... it's just a little too juvenile for me. BTW, I didnt mean anything by the 1 star review. I just wanted to be the first to do so. I'd really give it like a 4.5 for talent. oh, Im not 13 either, i just didnt feel like signing in"
5,B5 album is hott,"B5 album is hot..for 1, they can sing, dance, and kelly can rap...I love the whole album but the one song that has me listenin to it over and over is"" dance 4 u"", which i think should be their single..Holla"
5,Best CD,The B5 CD is to clean.The whole CD sound great I can't even choose a favoret song.I espessaily like the beats they chose to go with the songs definitely the song back in your arms with The Jackson 5 in the background and I realy think that this is the best CD that came out so far this year. All the other groups are doing there thing but I think B5 is the best.
5,They are so cute,They are such good singers.I especially love kelly's voice.They are all so cute and love their cd.
5,~*~*~*~*~*Hey Hey Hey i Love the Cd ~*~*~*~~*,The is Great i Loved it they are the new J5 . Toghether the harmonies were perfect personally the best song is Back in your arms But all toghether all the songs are perfect. THe are all fresh and dressed to impress and i love them ecpecially patrick he is ffwwwooooooiiinnnneeeeee.
1,B5 S*cks,"b5 S*cks WOrst Album i've ever heard in my whole entire life, There voices are F*cking irratating so as there wannabe a dancer moves. If you rate this album with 5stars you must be crazy in your head or something. Let me say it again this album S*cks S*cks S*cks and S*cks can you read it?. Don't waste your money on this album, thank me later."
5,Great,I loved this album!! I really like heartbreak and Dance 4 U!! man im gonna listen to that cd a LOT!!!
5,THA BEST,This album is great! My favorite song is heartbreak! I also like Nuthin `Bout me! They did a great job with this album! LOTS OF HITS!
4,A re-freshing piece of literature,Carrie Pilby is one of the most unique characters you will follow. The whole book is laugh out loud funny! Watching how much she over analyzes everything and trys to decide what she does like will have you in hysterics!
4,Red Dress Ink takes a different turn,"Carrie Pilby is a genius, but this fact alone doesn't make her life easy or enjoyable. She sees a therapist, works as a temp, and suffers from odd mental malaise. I found her insights to be believable, yet often annoying. Having known several people like Carrie in my life, (No, I'm not a genius!!) I can relate to the ways the other characters in the novel interact with her.I think this book definitely gives Red Dress Ink some credibility. This strays from the usual poor, loveless fashion hopeless protagonist and gives us someone who readers can truly empathize with. This is a fast read and a fabulous insight to the lonely world of ""geniushood."""
3,Italian fun,"My husband got this as a gift, and he enjoys it very much. Even my sons sing along. Hard to find CD and the price was right."
1,Lousy Training,"Maybe it is because I have spent much of my working life training people to work using a computer that I dislike this package so much. It is very superficial training for a new person. There is no training by actually doing outside of minimal entries in answer to a queston. One certainly does not feel ""educated"" after completing the course. Many aspects are ignored and there is no manual to use to pursue a greater understanding of what is not covered."
5,Hits hard and fast!,"Barrett Tillman and Bob Lawson have joined forces to produce a true jewel of a book on the US Dive and Torpedo bombers of WWII. Both individuals are recognized experts in the field and their collaboration has yielded a standout treatment of each significant dive and torpedo bomber in service during World War II. The text is an outstanding reference on the origin and development of each type aircraft as well as its introduction and success (or tribulations) in combat. This is nicely balanced by the superb imagery, many in color, and detailed captions. These gents really know their stuff and it shows. If you're interested in this subject and don't have it yet, your collection is not complete."
3,Blahh!,"I like some of Leigh Greenwoods books, this to me was not the best. The beginnig was to slow to start for me. I honestley couldn't finish the book and I tried a few times to finish, I just finally gave up."
2,The Pot does not have an Aligator on it...,My cast iron pot is very plain and cheap looking. There is no alligator on it as shown in the picture.I would recommend that you purchase a Lodge seasoned cast iron pot instead of this one.
5,"Handy little bag for a ""day"" out with your baby.","I purchased this as a shower gift from a gift registry. A picture was not available,so I was pleasantly surprised at its cute design and its quality for such a reasonable price.I filled it with a few of the traditional necessities, and it's ready for baby's first outing.(Not big enough for week-ends or other long trips, but the larger(matching)diaper bag is!)"
1,doesn't hold up like they used to,"I've used Rubbermaid bathmats for many years and was always happy with them, but the last two I bought didn't hold up for very long. One just after a few months, the suction cups started tearing out nearly everytime I'd lift it up (sometimes as many as six at a time). Soon it started looking like swiss cheese. Well, I assumed it was just a lemon that got past quality control. I bought another one and within a short length of time a whole strip (about 8"") ripped out. Then individual cups started ripping out. I guess even Rubbermaid is now producing inferior products and their name can no longer be considered dependable quality. Instead of holding up for several years like they used to, the last two I bought only lasted 6-12 months."
4,"great, not stinky bath mat, wrong color shipped","Old fashioned rubber bath mat, sturdy, good size. Does not have the terrible stink of bath mats made with the newer materials.Unfortunately vendor shipped beige, not white."
5,Ziggy,Ordered a CD through Amazon. Was a little concerned that it would take almost two weeks to receive. But it amazingly arrived exactly when I needed it. I had ordered the CD a week before I needed it for my husband's birthday. And it arrived on my husband's birthday. Great timing and I did e-mail seller about how long it would take to arrive. Received a rapid response. Ordering through Amazon is the best and would give it AAAAA+++.
5,true crime,This book the sex slave murders was captivating from the beginning. I really enjoyed it I also fet very bad for Charlene.
4,Good Read,"Well, I just paid $7.50 for this paperback from a competitor, and I'd say that's what it's worth. If you're into this case, it's worth the read. Just be sure to do a search for the title. It can be easily found for under $10 at many sites."
5,Classic,"This is one of the rare albums to emerge from the CCM market that is absolutely essential. It's out of print (though it looks like there are still a few copies, used, that you can get through Amazon at this point) so the band has the album available as a legal and free download off their site.Havalina is one of those rare bands who can switch up their sound every album, and yet still have the music feel like Havalina. This is their best, although ""Space, Love, and Bullfighting"" is also great."
2,"Forget about the ""stick"" part of the product","If this was not a ""peel & stick"" product I would have rated it much higher. We tried over and over to get this to stick to the wall and it just refused. We did scrub the walls quite thoroughly before even attempting it but I really don't think it mattered. We even tried it in a room that we had just painted with no luck. My wife ended up using mod podge to get it to stick. Anyway, if you buy it with the intent of gluing it or using mod podge like we did, then it's a great deal and a great border."
4,Spooky and entertaining,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It provided not only the entertainment of being spooked, when reading in a dark room, with only a light bright enough to read the pages, however it also provided a great deal of historical information about the area/house/building/etc. that is believed to be haunted. The author writes about haunted locations that she's actually experienced. However, the majority of the book is written about the experiences of others. I think you'll truly enjoy this book, I'm planning on purchasing the author's book about hauntings in the Gulf Coast Region of Texas - a little closer to home!"
2,Shouldn't Have Been Squeezed on Two CDs,"As much as I love that they showcased 100 great TV themes, that they are short versions offsets that. The themes for ""Friends"", ""Melrose Place"", and ""Will and Grace"" are over before you can blink an eye! I am particularly disappointed in ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" theme. It does not include the entire introduction with Steve and the crew communicating during Steve's initial liftoff. Instead, it begins with the crash sound. This collection should really be on 3 CDs, with each theme lengthened to their full potential."
4,Been Searching for Some of These Songs,"I was looking for a unique ringtone for my cell phone and purchased this album a while back just to get Carroll O'Connor & Jean Stapleton singing ""Those Were The Days"" and a few others. The album was a little pricey, but for what you get it's worth every penny. Individual tastes may vary, but the album includes theme songs from a pretty wide spectrum of TV shows from as early as the 70's. And for those of us who grew up watching TV between the 70's - 90's, this album does a pretty decent job of bringing back those good old days even if just every now and then. The quality is not perfect on some of the tracks, but certainly doable for casual enjoyment. As a ringtone, you should see the expressions on coworkers' faces when they hear Jean Stapleton hitting the high notes."
2,Where is The Munsters theme?,"The Munsters are known for their great theme song. Why isn't it on here? As for the 100 ""Greatest"" TV themes, I wouldn't say they are the ""greatest"", but just 100 different TV themes.Besides, a lot of the themes on this CD, you can download at sitcomsonline.com"
3,Tv theme songs,"I bought this CD because my husband and I were singing TV themes songs to entertain our 3 and 4-year-old boys and I couldn't remember alot of the words. I don't forget them now- and neither do our boys. I keep the CD in my car and whenever the boys are with me, they each have their favorites that they request. It's great!!"
3,"OK, but stated measurements are off","I wanted a small, casual/rustic table to hold my audio/video components. This unit looked good and relatively inexpensive. It is solid and easy to assemble. It looks OK, but it certainly is not a high quality piece, as the wood has a rough veneer or maybe even some type of laminated top. It is utilitarian piece, which is what I wanted. Importantly, the stated measurements are off: the table top surface is 24x24 inches. That is larger than I wanted, but I can live with it, at least for a while."
5,Great guide for galleries,"Very useful guide, especially for galleries and places of interest. Didn't use it for housing and not much for food."
3,Interesting,I found the subject matter to be interesting for a Mystery/Suspense novel. It held my attention and I especially liked the twist at the end
3,Excellent story not so great ending.,"This was a great story, the plot development was wonderful and the twist at the end was really shocking, however I am only giving this story 3 stars because i thought I was shortchanged by the ending. I wish the author would have included Nancy's AKA DeAnn's reunion with her family and how they received her and their reactions to her news etc. That would have made this book worthy of 5 stars but still a great book nonetheless."
3,Would have been great if it came with code for online services,"Very informative, but would have been great to have a code for the online services."
3,Sand Filter Scoop,"Very sturdy, and a must for beach detecting. Works well, but the handle not being curved is a little hard on the hands to dig with. I have an older one that I can't seem to find that has a curved handle and was much better for digging. Very well made device, but could use a little better design."
3,A few good pieces of music.,"There are a few songs on this CD that I really don't enjoy and that's probably a first for me when it comes to music for yoga practise. I have no doubt that's it's merely a personal preference - there's a specific instrument with a high pitched sound that seems to annoy me, especially on the first track. The other choices aren't bad, but I would try to listen to each track a little longer before purchasing to make sure you like this type of music - I just listened to a few seconds of each track and it was very different after listening to 3 mins of the same song."
1,he needs to get back with paul brown,"not what I was expecting from him. Everyone out there knows Boney is a fantastic saxophonist. However, this album left much to be desired. I wonder why he left Paul Brown, his former producer. He released some excellent albums with Paul brown. I don't think he's doing well enough on his own. I did not find any track particularly mind-blowing. If anyone that really knows boney doubts this, perhaps you ought to listen to ""seduction"" and ""sweet thing"" before making any comments. This latest album is nothing compared to those two. woork harder boney. I would not advise anyone new to Jazz to buy this album."
3,lose dvd,"i bought this as a gift for christmas and had to give it to them early because i heard one of the dvds rattling around. the first dvd skipped a little, but not too bad. the rest in this season were fine."
3,"1 good episode, the rest O.K.. Beware of loose damaged discs!","The Alcatraz 100th episode is about the only really good episode here, season 6 was full of dud investigations. TAPS needs more haunted lighthouses & western ghost towns where activity seemed to be really high.I had to visit three stores before I could find a copy that did not have loose, damaged discs. The sales clerks even opened up the cases to see if the loose discs were still good, but they were heavily scratched up. One major chain store (with a bullseye logo) has pulled the DVDs off the shelves because all of their copies were damaged. I ended up with a copy that had loose discs, but not yet scratched up."
1,Well that was disappointing.,"I was really disappointed with this book. The reviews I read led me to believe it would be pretty fun, but, I have to say, not so much. The story was hard to follow, as frequently the author would refer back to details that had never been presented, or characters that hadn't been introduced.I have to say, though, that I was most put off by the characters. It felt like the author was trying for a gritty, film noir kind of theme, but I think he fell short of the mark. The male characters were either swaggering jerks, or distracted,""mad-scientist"" types, and the female characters were all selfish, spoiled, and not terribly bright. I get that that kind of film noir genre has its character archetypes, and that I'm a product of a post-women's lib society, but really, I think it went too far. Especially when the lead character started turning the women over his knee, to ""teach them a lesson.""All in all, boo for this book."
5,A tasty change from the usual,"I don't have fresh blackcurrant fruit every day so I'm not sure if this tea gets the flavor exactly right but it sure is close to what I expected. It's a refreshing change from the norm in black teas (plain, lemon, berry etc...). A few reviewers found it plain tasting which might be due to the fact that the flavor becomes more familiar after a few sips (the flavor doesn't last long in your mouth as if you're chewing flavored gum), but most tea lovers should still find it a refreshing change."
5,Excellent!,"My wife is Russian and she grew up having tea as a main beverage. Later, she lived in London for several years. As such, she appreciates the finer varieties of teas and our kitchen pantry always has at least a half dozen different kinds of tea on the beverage shelf. Just the other day she picked up a 20-bag box of Ahmad Blackcurrent Tea at a little European delicatessen she favors. She's been raving about how excellent it is ever since and pressured me to try it. Well, it was good, but I'm really more of a coffee lover and it's as difficult for me to judge a fine tea as it is for her to recognize an outstanding coffee. Believe me, however, her taste in teas is refined and if she says it's excellent I would fully trust her judgment. The price, by the way, as listed here is a bargain.Gary Peterson"
2,Fragile--arrived broken. Bulky handle.,"This spoon has a plastic core, which is fragile enough that mine arrived already broken in two, clean across the neck.The handle on the spoon is large and thick--perhaps not good for smaller hands. But for medium-to-large hands it conforms to either hand nicely. The size and thickness of the handle mean you'll probably need to store it in a drawer or hang it from a utensil rack. It would crowd other utensils out of a standing utensil crock.The bowl of the spoon holds 1/4 cup of liquid when full."
5,bulky,"Bulky, but very comfortable, easy to get on/off, and has good retention. If I'm in the market for a owb (non cc) holster again, I'm going to look at fobus first."
1,So boring that I couldn't bear to watch it,CSI Maine is obviously comedy which is so subtly nuanced that it avoids humour by a wide margin.
3,Seaweed,"Good seaweed, easy to soak and use - though a bit fishy tasting. Good value for the price if the fishy taste does not bother you, its a bit too much for me."
1,Microphone does not work.,"I would highly recommend to refrain from buying this product, as it does not work with the software that is delivered with the actual microphone. I have spent days and nights browsing forums to get this microphone to work, and have absolutely tried everything, but have had no luck in getting it to work.I have even purchased an expensive sound card, because my motherboard with built-in sound card would not have the microphone work, even though I have a $1200 PC, with advanced hardware, purchased about a year and a half ago, when this microphone was already on the market. I have had the microphone for about a year, now, and have tried to get it to become functional, multiple times.This product has only spawned utter frustration and cost me good amounts of time, to no end. If there are alternatives to this microphone, for your budget and likings, save yourself the possible hassle that this microphone may give you."
2,works great ... when it works,"i own 2 of these mics, and have had great luck recording various forms of hand percussion and drum set with them. The first one lasted about a year but was replaced relatively hassle-free by the company, and the second one is still going strong. My only advice is that if you do buy it, walk or drive carefully with it, as it is a delicate condenser mic. I clicked 2 stars but i could easily stretch it up to 3 or 4 - i'd say its a worthy investment. Maybe go with the recording/podcasting pack version of this mic, since a hard case is included. the CO3U has great sound quality, something i'd expect from a much more expensive mic."
5,Great Mic,"It's a better choice when it comes to a easy solution for podcasters, singers, and any acoustic musician who want's to record an analog source such as a voice or just about any acoustic instrument directly to his or her pc or mac, it just do what it was designed to do."
2,Too noisy,"Mic is good built, heavy. Sound quality is decent, but the mic has strong self-noise, a background noise produced by the mic itself, which becomes quiet strong if you have to amplify the recording. I have it 2 years now but as I am going into recording more in the next time, I am up looking for a better USB mic with less noise."
3,"Excellent writing and plot, but...","While the writing is very good and the plot moves along, the ""set pieces"" with oh-so-cute but cliched characters really wore me out. Here for example we find the drunken but lovable playwright; the ex-football player college provost; the wise and adorable country western singer; the ditsy English department chairman; and the lovable, naive, handsome main character, described all too often as the ""big American.""The plot revolves around a university faculty, a play and the question of who wrote it. Each of the above characters performs in numerous ""acts"" that become tedious as they repeat themselves.I did finish the book, not because I was curious about the outcome, but because the writing drew me along. Many very good descriptions, if only they hadn't repeated themselves so often.And, by the way, the author is American, not English."
4,Witty,"While I prefer Michael Malone's Justin and Cuddy series, this book is fun. Academia types will see their counterparts (never themselves) in this witty rendition of university insider foolishness, jealousy and ill-temper. Sir Walter Raleigh would be astonished. Recommended."
1,Awful,"I have bought about 10 CDs for Halloween; and this onesadly rates as one of the worst. Quality recording andediting is about the only good thing I can say about it.The tracks of people laughing sound forced and artificial; thespirits sound like a couple of junior-high schoolers.The tracks of screams are just screams, without any force orfear in them.The vast majority of the tracks are very short, even less than 5 seconds, don't offer anything especially spooky, and the CD is virtually useless to play for trick-or-treaters on Halloween. It would have been far better if the creators used their talents to make several collages of scary sounds grouped according to various themes. Several years ago, you'd have to make do with something as mediocre as this. But these days there are lots of other Halloween CD alternatives. If you want real satisfaction,skip this waste of money and go for one of those alternatives."
1,Not Good,I am in pretty good shape and thought this DVD was just awful. The pace is WAY to slow for anyone in shape. I thought the instructor took way to long to explain very simple moves and I did not feel like this video would help me stay in shape. I could barely complete the DVD one time because it was so incredibly boring. I also did not like the set up of the DVD itself because each individual excercise needed to be prompted by pushing a button so after each exercise I had to push the next button and this was annoying. I would only purchase this DVD is I had NEVER excerised before in my life and was interested in only simple stretches. Ultimately it is a waste of money and I was very disapointed.
1,Put me to sleep!,"This was supposed to be one of the better pilates tapes, but it put me right to sleep. I hated her voice.I ended up taking a class instead!"
3,Slow Slow Slow,"One admission. I am 16 weeks into my pregnancy with a sore bump, so I did the Later Pregnancy Workout. The exercises are fine. They are mild. My biggest issue is that the workout stops each time the moves change and the instructor discusses what's coming next. So, the pace is very slow. I may come to appreciate it during my 8th month, but today I will place the DVD in the back of my rotation."
1,Scratch and Solve Hangman? I THINK NOT!,"This was absolutely horrendous! Why buy this overpriced defective puzzlebook when you could buy something that actually works? The scratch off seals don't work. We tried a penny, a quarter, and our fingernails, and nothing worked. How hard could it be to make a scratch-off seal that actually scratches off? The people at the lottery have no problem doing it. Eventually, after my aunt and I tried just about every material known to man, the last thing that we tried was a metal nail file, and that still wasn't entirely successful-- it was extremely difficult to make even that work. This little tiny book cost $6.00! And it doesn't even work right! Why in the world would you spend $6.00 on a hangman game that doesn't even work? You could spend your money much more wisely. You can buy tons of stuff for $6.00. I absolutely loathe this game. I am taking it back. The only possible use for this book is as a firestarter. I hope you don't buy this game."
4,Good CD.,"This CD is very cool but don't expect anything too original here. One of the songs is on ""Plastic Soul Impalement"", and one was later remixed on ""Throwing A Wrench..."" (I use the term remix loosely, they sound completely different). This CD shows the beginnings of an awesome band. 4 stars."
5,Gone Too Long From The Heart!,"""Suddenly"" was worn out as a teenager because of understandable words & meanings,fantastic presentation in vocals. Have spent decades dreaming of getting this album backinto the collection & my soul. ""Harmony"" is icing on the cake!"
5,Deepen your prayer life,Want to increase the effectiveness of your prayer life? Try praying for the things Paul prays. This marvelous book will shape the content of your prayer life. His treatment of God's sovereignty and the exercise of prayer is a must read.
2,lots of blank pages,"I bought this book because I thought that I would be able to see everything in the exhibition in detail, and more, as is usually the case with most catalogs from museum shows. Well, this was not the case at all! There was so little in this book, that I decided to return it because it was such a disappointment. The book shows three views of the same few dresses, one view per page, and a tiny bit of the jewelry, with many big blank pages spread out in between, as if they had to get this done in a hurry and had to fill up a certain amount of pages by press time, so it would look like it was ""designed"". It didn't show anywhere near the scope of what Chanel did, either a long time ago or the more recent things done by Lagerfeld."
5,Whatever knowledge you need in here!,"This series "" An intimate note to the sincere seeker"" is absolutely stunning!! In the 7 volumes, I feel His Holiness has touched all the dimensions of human existence, spiritual, material, inter-personal, emotional, intellectual!! My personal experience- whenever I am going through a tough time or have some doubts, I pick any of these volumes. I open any random page and read. Sure enough, I find an answer to my doubts and my distress drops. And thousands around the world have reported a similar experience. This series is my real wealth. :)"
2,Typical Doctor Who,"""Revenge of the Cybermen"" is as corny as the title sounds. A novelization of the Tom Baker serial, the book follows the story faithfully, even recreating the long stretches of boredom found in the script. Nothing special."
2,Repetition,"While I thought that this book had an interesting story, and agree in part with many of the other reviews, there is one overall reason that I gave such a low rating. Kellen, one of the main characters of this book is an endearing young man, with many questions and outlooks upon his life in general. Throughout the novel, Kellen comes upon his realizations and revelations on the blink of an eye, going back and forth from one view to another, doubting just about everything there is to doubt. This is a book of adventure and far off lands, but this feeling of excitement at untold journeys is somewhat put off by the fact that you know the main character will always find the answer when he needs it, at the snao of your fingers. If it wasn't for this, the book would have been, in my opinion, far more enjoyable."
3,Brown Spots,It may still be a bit early for this review which is why I am giving it a middle of the road (3 star) review -I have only been using the product for several weeks. I do not notice any improvement yet in the age spots on my face.
5,Wonderful results!,"Not only does this product work wonders to fade my sun-spots, it also helps keep my face smoother and better looking overall. I swear it reduces lines as well (maybe due to the exfoliating effect). This and the pHaze 35 acne gel have my skin looking better than it has in years."
2,The individual recipes MAY be worthwhile....,"It is almost impossible to judge the recipes in this cookbook. The readers' star rating of this book is also strange, given how badly it is designed!This paperback edition may be the problem, but I haven't seen the other (non-Canadian published) editions, so I can't be sure. The font selection is just awful, with an extremely light typeface used for the recipe preparation sections (the ingredients' font is ok), thus making the book almost impossible to read in most kitchens. Then there is the issue of the thickness of this cookbook (it's thick), vis a vis it's outside dimensions. I can't imagine keeping the book open to any one recipe page, without having a 20 pound crowbar to lay across the open pages.Book design is especially important in cookbooks, and this one fails most of the critical tests..."
2,Quite expensive item,"This 250g package is really quite a small package, for which I paid over $10 on Amazon.Because it specifies a European weight measure, I was not prepared for how small this package is.I wanted to give this item as a gift, but will now have to add other items to my gift.Substantially overpriced, in my opinion."
4,Lovin the car,My Grandson love this and it was easy for him to put together. He is very happy with it
5,Beautiful,The poetry in this book is just beautiful. I don't think it's an option to believe otherwise. READ IT! You'll love it.
4,A well written and Organized Text!,The text was full of great classroom management techniques and ideas to try for the classroom teacher. Topics were covered in great detail and examples of classroom problem situations were included. Overall this was an easy-to-read excellent text!
2,Hmmm,"I bought this sight unseen from all the rave reviews. I have to say I was disappointed. Looking through the other comments, I have to agree with the reviewer that referred to it as an 'overblown production'.I love costuming and the 18th century is my favourite period, but from the reviews I was expecting something a little more flashy.If you've never had any exposure to 18th century clothing and furnishings before then I could see how this could be a revelation, but to a serious costumer, it's a bit average to say the least.I think boobs and debauchery on stiff looking models would have to be a better title - these have to be the worst costume models I've ever seen.It's hard to see details in the gowns, the lighting and photograpy are poor, the paintings are ok, but seem to revolve more around sex then clothing and the whole thing is just lacking in presentation in my opinion.Not sure whether to cut this up for reference or donate it to the library.Sorry I bought it."
4,loved it but.....,"I loved the book, very nicely written and very engaging but I agree with the other reviewer the diversion into NYC Central Park/Olmsted/the Masons was overly long and did not add to the story much at all, IMHO."
5,An Excellent Book,"This book follows the struggles of a young girl growing upunder a corrupt Plutocracy where the Corporations rule -non-stockholders are reduced to prison laborers and any objection is met with violent suppression. Busby's characters and setting are well-written and evocative and he makes them believable. The reader is uplifted by the display of determination and strength of character and given an enduring perspective through which to view the issues of crime, decadence and worldly power."
2,Not my type of perfume,"I was shopping online and a friend suggested it to me not at all light sented very strong. Delivery was great it came in at the time that it said that it would. The only problem with this is that it smelled like old women perfume after a couple of minutes it was not that bad, but it still smelled like something that my grandmotgher would wear. Hope that this helps...."
4,A revealing book,"I found this book searching through the fiction section at the library. I thought it would be a fu fu book for fun but it ended up revealing some things about my personality and the relationship I was having with a friend of mine. The main character, Claire is a southern gal who is somewhat conservative and sheltered before coming to NYC. When she gets there she meets Jade and uncovers some romantic feelings she has for her while also being scared of admitting them to herself. The only part I didnt like about the book is the few months where there was no Jade at all and Claire was putsing around the city being bored without any friends and nothing interesting was happening. I recommend this book to anyone who is unsure of their sexuality. This book made me feel like having feelings for someone of the same sex isnt dirty; it's a beautiful thing."
4,Very good,"Story of a young girl moving from a small New Mexican town to New York, where she falls for her enigmatic neighbor. Claire struggles with finding herself in this new environment where her experiences are far beyond what she could have experienced had she stayed in NM. She struggles with coming to terms with her relationship with her friend-lover (a hip, beautiful and insecure dancer - a woman), and we follow her as she makes independent and daring decisions in her new life. This is a well told story about a girl leaving her old self behind to be more daring and embrace a life of her own, while struggling with her newfound independance, homesickness, and who she is becoming. It took me a few chapters to get into it, but I finished in a a couple days once I got going."
2,Not an Aerial Combat DVD,"This DVD mainly covers the development,production,deployment,and operational maintenance of the P-38.It has few interesting combat actions other than some strafing. Only three outstanding aces are mentionedby name (Bong,Zempke. ) and only Bong (top ace with 40 ) is mentioned in any detail. P-38s shot downYamamoto's plane,but if that was mentioned, I missed it. Some lack of combat action was probably dueto the design of the P-38 as a high altitude interceptor (and subsequent use as a ground attack plane).I did like the description of its development,and the details about the main designer Kelly Johnsonwho was born near where I live. If you want to read more about Lockheed,get the book Skunk Works."
2,Ruth needs a break,"It's not that I didn't enjoy reading this book or most of it. Ozick is a interesting writer with a unique style which I liked but the story was incredible depressing. This idealistic lawyer (Ruth Puttermesser) is put through so much disappointment and misery,(to what end I can not fathom), it seems she is attacked at every turn. Even her dreams/fantasies destoy her. It was that ending that took this book from 4 or 5 stars to 2. I really don't need books to have happy endings but Ozick truly but Ruth through Hell. I don't think it was fitting and it damaged the whole story for me. Let hope Ozick life is better than Ruth's."
1,DO NOT GET IT!,"I was at the bookstore one month before my trip to Greece and I decided to get a book to learn some Greek. This book was the only thing on the shelf in the language book section that had greek in it. I decided to get it. It looked nice and I especially liked the dialogues. A few days later I opened the book and started to study it. I started with the alphabet and then moved on to the beggining of chapter 1. Then everything changed. THIS BOOK HAD A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF VOCABULARY TO MEMORIZE! I spent hours for 3 days trying to memorize all of it. It is all right to have dialogues and SMALL vocabulary lists, but what was in there is way over the limit. DO NOT listen to the other reviews they are just Greeks and people who know some Greek (or are friends of the author)!I could not remember any Greek when I went to Greece. GET THE LONELY PLANET GREEK PHRASEBOOK,IT IS MUCH BETTER."
2,Marius? A child molester?,"Out of all the characters in the vampire chronicles, Armand was a mystery while Marius, next to Lestat, was one I most loved and admired. This book, while uncovering most of Armand's secrets and hidden past, has somehow made me lose interest in both of these characters. Although it had a few unexpected twists,(one which involves the night that Claudia died) it was mainly weak and without much content. Anne Rice has really done it this time. Not only did she reduce Marius to a mere pedophile, but she turned Armand into(before he was captured by the coven) an ungrateful brat. He (Armand) shows no strength of character or independent thinking whatsoever, only slaving for one master after another. I was also disgusted by the crudity and rawness that was displayed in this book. Maybe it was my misconception of perceiving Marius and Armand purely as father and son. Either way, I did not expect what this book was about to offer."
3,umm that was that?!,"ah yes after reading the rest of the vampire chronicles i must say this book was a bit of a disapointment. I know in the other books Armand was a little deprived but i Think to illistrate him a snivling ""creature"" like that discusted me. The book really refered too much to the other chronicles and wasn't too much for originality. I hope the next one's better."
2,vampires rehashed to the point of mediocrity,"Rice used to be a good author. Much of ""Armand"" is a repeat of all we've read before, except for it's continuous, voluminous and tedious referrals to religion and the constant homosexual encounters of the vampires and mortals. These episodes are not even erotic though exceedingly graphic. Religion and gay sex just seem compromised under the same covers. This once avid fan will probably avoid these endless, rambling tomes in the future."
3,Who doesn't love Armand?,"I love Armand(next to Lestat, of course). I was thrilled at the prospect of learning of his origins and his life before the dark gift. I have to admit being a little disappointed with the results. Not that Ms. Rice isn't at her glorious best, but, I just didn't find that connection like I did with THE VAMPIRE LESTAT. It just didn't ooze with fire and brimstone like it did at Lestat's vampiric creation. I guess the one thing that made me go huh was the sexual slavery of Armand to his master and the apparent violations that took place over a small period of time. It just didn't sit well. But, Ms. Rice is the author and she knows where her characters came from, so that will just have to be good enough."
1,Must reading for All Death row inmates,"I cannot beleive I subjected myself to this very painful horror once again. After reading Pandora and Violin, I promised myself that I deserved better. I must confess that I'm a devote fan of Anne Rice and have continued to read her books in hope of discovering the once fantastic tales she once produced. But not since the Witching Hour, (clearly her best work), have I ever been rewarded. I find it extremely surprising that many readers viewed this as a fantastic read!"
1,Reading this is like being Pooped on by a Flock of Pigeons,"This book transcends bad. What can I say, it [was very weak]. The writing is dismal. There is no character development - there is character regression. The once great, engaging, tortured Armand is now a twerp.... And Marius, who used to be ruthless, powerful and subtle, is now a child-molesting Whiner. I remember while reading Interview for the first time some fifteen years ago imagining that I was interviewing Louie, and wondering how I'd react if I were in the presence of Lestat or Louie. Now, I know exactly what I'd do if I were in the presence of Marius and Armand. I'd slap Marius upside the head and make Armand finish the dishes...."
1,Why I won't read this one (yet),"Violin was HORRIBLE. Pandora was weak. I loved all her pre-Memnoch stuff: vampires, witches. BUT... Very disappointed lately, so I will not shell out for hardback. Will check reviews here (sorry this isn't quite a review of this book, but...) Could have avoided Violin if only I'd checked here first. Gag!"
2,Barbara Cartland would be embarrassed!,"Go straight to Chapter 8. Chapters 1 throuh 7 were pure trash. Pedophelia may be part of the world, and it may have been an integral part of the development of Armand's character, but this is pathetic. I thought Violin put an end to Anne Rice's self-indulgence, but the first seven chapters read like a 13 year old boy's wet dream! The relationship between Armand and Marius is without depth, dimension and eroticism. At its best, it is petulant. The remainder of the story is interesting, but not up to the hype."
1,Run away SCREAMING...but not in a good way.,"How Barnes and Noble had the nerve to publish this mish-mash plotless wonder is truly beyond me. My theory is that Louis actually wrote the first book, ""Interview with the Vampire"" and Anne Rice has since just tried to make do without him. Incredibly boring; filled with homoerotic but juvenile sex fantasties, listless meandering plot (what there was of one), wretchedly inept descriptions of a rich historical era and, incomplete resolutions...doesn't Anne Rice have a conscience (or an editor?). To unleash this immature half-baked work on unsuspecting fans is craftily criminal. SKIP THIS ONE."
5,Wonderful. Armand is a perfect Vampire,"I cant believe there are so many bad reviews on here of this book!Awesome book. the ending was a shocker. This is one of the best Chronicles next to Interview and Vampire Lestat. I wish Louis would have had a bigger part since he's my favorite, but it was still awesome."
3,"So, what's new?","Anne Rice only wrote one good book: Interview with the Vampire. All the rest is a re-hash of the same story. Why are people disappointed with ""Armand""? Rice's vampire books lost originality and turn into a soap opera right away with ""The Vampire Lestat"". At least, she has been doig more research lately, trying to create a background of culture on what would otherwise be pulp fiction.I have discover the way to endure Anne Rice: audio books. I no longer have the patience to rea her books. They get way too boring on those long pseudo-philosophical sections. At least, if someone reads it aloud for me, it keeps me awake."
5,Masterpiece!,"Like one of the other reviewers, I'll make this short and sweet. This book can be summed up in 3 words...Fab-U-Lous! Keep up the good work!"
4,above average,having read the other books in the Vampire Chronicles I certainly enjoyed this one. The story follows Armand from his time with Marius up to the present. He is quite the troubled soul and Anne Rice reminds you of this again and again. I found it to be captivating at some points but drag slightly at others. I also found myself having to re-read some of the more religous parts in order to grasp the meaning and reason for their inclusion. It wasn't the best book in the series but I enjoyed it none the less.
4,The boy toy gets his own book!,"Ok,I won't get into all the twists and turns of this book ora review of the previous books in this series. I can only saythat this book was Awesome. It gives you a better understandingof some of the choices Armand made in the past and what is the fuel behind his thinking. It is a ""slow"" book in the early chapters but picks up tempo and content quickly. You will not be disappointed. This book is true the the general theme of the series. Happy reading!"
3,"in the spirit of ""the vampire lestat""","all in all, not too bad. the homo-eroticism was a bit excessive, however a necesary part of the story. this was more in the spirit of Interview or Lestat, than the other books in the series. Anne Rice's strengths lie in her ability to put together a good historical fiction, and a solid use of the first person point of view. all in all, after reading the other books in the series, i just naturally continued with this one, however, ever since all the questions were answered in book three, there hasn't been a strong reason (for me) to really continue reading the books. Originally, the mystery was the real draw to continue reading the series (Where did these vampires come from?). However, since nothing new is gained except for the life of armand, i give it three stars as a stand-alone book -- not really a necesary part of the vampire chronicles, but interesting nonetheless."
2,Armand comes off like a boring fool in a boring book.,"I felt no empathy towards Armand. Rather, he comes off as foolish, boring, and dumb. This was not, I think, Anne's intent. The story line lacks creativity, and the character development suffers for it. A classic example of writing for money rather than passion's sake, and the entire series pays the price."
1,Not Up to Anne Rice's earlier works,"I loved Anne Rice's early works, but the magic has slowly turned into aimless wanderings. Rice has become so successful that her editors no longer seem to be able to do their jobs--i.e., EDIT. The book reads like a first draft--or perhaps a short story that has been hopelessly forced into book length. After 50 pages, I was still wondering when the storyline would start moving along; after 75 pages I gave up and moved on to something else"
3,"Nice overview, but not her best work.","The Vampire Armand is a great book for people who haven't read the rest of the Vampire Chronicles. For those that have, it is a more in-depth version of the story that Lestat has already told about Armand. This takes up about three-fourths of the book.The remainder is a rather engrossing tale that describes Armand's struggle to find his faith again, and how the Veil of Veronica effected him so profoundly. This part of the book mimics Rice's other works in her emotional and heartbreaking discussion of good vs. evil.The expository part of the book that tells of Armand's life from the beginning, is of course full of Rice's characteristic lurid prose and rich, intense environments and relationships. It does, however, somewhat bore those of us who have read the other Vampire books, since we know the story already.Strongly recommended for those who don't have a background with Rice but certainly not her best work."
2,Disappointed,Probably a good video for an introduction to hip-hop styles of dance. But the instruction and the dance itself were sub-par. There are other hip-hop instructional videos that are of a much higher quality.
2,Not as good as the first one...,"Some very annoying elves in here that won't anyone ask them questions directly, except in times of war, supposedly. That rule was suspended for the end of the first book. But there's a war going on thru out this novel, and the society Lackey set's up in the first book doesn't follow it's own logic in this book. I don't get why this stupid rule of not asking questions is back in place with the war going on. Supposed to be a set of ""war manners"".Why does this upset me so much? Cuz it affects the movement of the action, and a lot of time is spent with elves. So if you're looking for a plodding slow annoying read. This is your book."
4,A bit scary for kids,"I loved the illustrations, but I thought the overall book was kind of scary for kids, but my son (4 years old) doesn't seem to notice and loves it."
4,Great introduction to Trusts,I read this book shortly after my wife started working at a bank in the Trust Department as a Trust Administrator. She did not have any background in Trusts but much in administration and that was the skill the bank needed. Her supervisor was a fantastic teacher and introduced my wife to the world of Estates and Trusts. She in turn introduced me by having me read this book. The material is well presented and organized. The basic information helps you understand the signifcance between planning and not planning. It provides you enough information so you can make reasonable decisions about you own plan of action. It also helps you understand what questions to ask when considering a lawyer draw up your documents. I would highly recommend this book to sanyone who is considering a Will or a Trust. It is well worth the cost eventhough some of the information is slightly out-dated.
5,Works like a charm!,"For people on the go like me this charger is the thing to have!It's easy to forget to charge the phone ,isn't it?With this product that's one less worry. Knowing I can have afreshly charged battery in my phone while I'm on the road is the next best thing to a AAA membership!"
5,Raves for Silver Storm,"This was the first book that I read by this author and I fell in love. Normally I stick with a select few authors but once I finished this book I bought the other two books in this series and all for books in another series. I love the way her heroine is no wilting miss but neither is she so strong that she doesn't need a man. Additionally I think that it is great that she allows her hero get mad at the heroine, it really shows that he is human. As a history teacher I find historical detail accurate and impressive. The author does not shy away from writing about the hardships that people dealt with during that time."
1,Stupid,"I have a code - any book in which the heroine utters the phrase ""You are incorrigible!,"" I immediately stop reading. While I don't recall that specific phrase, this whole story gave me that ""throw my Kindle across the room in disgust"" feeling. Like another reviewer, I read 40%, put it down out of boredom, finally finished it but man, it was tough. Just plain dumb and dull writing, an idiotic heroine, superficially historical setting. I can only hope since this is the first in the series, that the writing increases substantially."
4,Enjoyable history.,"For those looking for historical romance set in the very early days of the United States of America, this book brings history to life."
4,A delight,Enjoy given this book a four star . It was full of excitment and romance. One of those books you don't put down. Will for sure tell my friends about.
3,good story,the hero is a a french ship's captan during the American Revolution. Nice love story but poorly written. I could be a very good book but needs editing. With work it would make a very good story
3,Silver Storm,"I never got to a point in this book where I found myself liking the hero.....I actually found him verging on the edge of snarky. The heroine also seems a bit of a twit.....easily swayed in her emotions. All in all, I found it a rather unsatisfactory read."
1,Too Many Factual Errors Plus An Annoying Ending,"This book contains some simple factual errors that make one doubt the concentration of both author and editor. For example, on page 131 the arithmetic is all wrong. The original payment to the service was $180 per hour and Delia got $60 of that. The subsequent direct payments to Delia's post office box were $50 per hour, which is certainly not 3 times $60 as stated. Seems she actually gave herself a cut in pay, which might also be appropriate for the author/editor. The suspense of waiting until the end of the book for revelation of 'what Delia did' kept me interested through some rather repetitious and boring episodes. However - there was no revelation! The secret was never revealed to the poor sucker reading the book. I was annoyed by this at the time, and still am a day later. I can only be grateful that I got this book from the library and didn't spend any money on it."
3,"A disappointing page turner, predictable","While I found the book to be a real page-turner, I realized by the end that I only wanted to find out if my suspicions were correct. I found the book to be predictable with an ending that came as no surprise. Groom's persistent references to old movies and actors is distracting. His character development begins excitingly but falls short in the end. Wait for the paperback on this one."
2,Worked Well Until It Broke,"I too had problems:First, the interlock starting failing. With some effort I am able to temporarily fix it until it failed again -- definitely an inconvenience.Much more troubling is the lid lock broke when a carrot wedged between the blade and lid, and the top popped open. That was the end of this device. I don't plan to hold the interlock and lid by hand (dangerous).It's a shame really, because it worked well, and had a very good price. But, if it fails so easily, and has such weak components, is it really such a good buy?"
2,Worked fine for a year but then flimsy handle broke.,This worked fine for us for about a year but then the handle broke which makes it useless. The safety mechanism won't latch properly without the handle being intact and it is now impossible to use.
3,disappointment from kitchenaid,"The machine it's self is very nice and seems to be well built; everything works just as it should. The problem I have is there is only one choice of slice/shred blade; the slice blade is 2mm, thats about the size of a thick pepperoni. And with that said I'm disappointed with Kitchenaid on this item and would normally expect more from Kitchenaid.Happy hoilidays"
4,Good appliance,This appliance works very well. The only complaint is that food gets up under the blade around the power shaft and is very hard to remove.
1,I Agree With ALL the One-Star Reviews,"I was about to write a very lengthy review about the KitchenAid KFP715 7-cup food processor. I found I don't have to... MANY others have said it as well as I could.I spent over $100.00 on the processor and within a year I had to replace the lid TWICE (at about $30.00 each with shipping). Before it was 14 months old the handle disintegrated rendering the processor unusable. The cheapest price for a replacement bowl is about $40.00 with shipping.I am ditching this piece of junk and replacing it with a Cuisinart or Braun. I will decide which shortly. We have begun a ""from the studs-out"" kitchen renovation with all new appliances, Care to guess which brand will NOT appear in my new kitchen?"
1,Burnt out first use,"I received this as a Christmas gift and used it for the first time to make hummus a few days later. When it was almost finished blending the motor burnt out and the blade would no longer spin when the on button was hit. I am very disappointed, as I thought Kitchen aid was a respectable brand. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,Only as good as the cheapest part.,"I had this processor for a good while, and it never failed to do what I wanted it to do. Then, the cheap little plastic ring that allows the bowl to fix itself onto the base broke. It's not even a locking device; it just gets past the safety system that will allow the thing to run. Now I have a doorstop with a strong little motor in it that won't run."
4,Just the right size,I like the KitchenAid a lot. Consumers Report Magazine has rated this highly and I agree. It does a perfect job whether it is grating potatoes for pancakes or chopping cauliflower for a mashed cauliflower recipe. There is one problem which is minor. The cover rim edge is hard to clean.
2,Broke too soon,"I've had this food processor a little over a month now. It worked great until the plastic piece that locks the lid to the bowl broke. When the lid doesn't lock, the processor won't run. I was definately not happy when it broke while in the middle of making dinner. I have contacted Kitchenaid, but haven't heard back. I dislike cheap plastic parts!"
4,Fit for Purpose,"I wanted a bigger food processor so chose this one. Not too big, not too small (small was what I had). Strong motor, get's the job done quickly and easy to clean. Haven't tried any other blade other than the usual chopper blade so am looking forward to more fun."
1,this is not what I expected,"Tis is not matched what it was described in Ads, I am disappointed with this item."
1,Little Introduction,"This book has exactly the same content you could expect from the first slides of a presentation given by IBM. If you want to read a summary of what the old Java EE specs were, get them. If you want any substance, keep out."
3,Pleased To Meet You,"If you are a real Sinatra buff, the song performances by Sinatra are what make this B-movie quality film worth watching."
1,Little analysis,"This is not a very helpful book to understand globalization. The author makes a lot of rhetorical comments, blames every bad thing in the world on multinational corporations or international organizations, and offers little analysis in global issues. It is also deplorable that the author mostly refers to newspapers and popular magazines rather than academic books, even though he is an economics professor. (There is no bibliography in the book, only a few endnotes for each chapter). Last but not least, the book is very poorly written. It is dull, repetitive, and full of unnecessarily long sentences."
4,A Bit Disappointed,"I read Barbara Miller's ""The Guardian"" and fell in love with Draco, so I could not wait to read his story.He did not disappoint in this book, but I really did not care for Juliet. I could understand her wanting the best for her sister,Ariel, in hoping that she would marry Draco, but take a hint. Draco could not have been more open with his feelings for Juliet and she kept ignoring him and talking about her sister. Juliet was stiff, cold and very demanding.I would have liked to have read an epilogue telling if they had any children and where they chose to live as these were issues between them.Barbara Miller's love scenes are few and without much passion, but that is just her style.I enjoyed all of the other characters that returned from The Guardian.I gave this book 4 stars because I enjoyed most of the characters and the storyline, not to mention just loving Draco.I would recommend this book."
3,romantic-at-heart,"I liked the second story better than the first - that is why I gave it three stars and not two. Diana Palmer is one of my most favorite authors. I love how she can make you ""feel"" the love and passion between the two characters. Her stories are original, passion filled, some are tear jerkers, and perfect for those romantic-at-heart readers like myself.I get frustrated, though, when there is more of the drug cartel story line going on than the romance. It seemed like the first story was too rushed and more information was about the drug cartel than the characters. I want the romance first and foremost. Still - DP is great and I have many - many of her books on my favorite read shelf."
4,A departure from his usual formula,I enjoyed Patterson's latest. It wasn't as riveting as earlier novels but it was one of the better books I've read this year. I don't regret a penny of what I spent on the hardcover.
3,A pleasent book about a chaotic presidential campaign,"It is a nice book, well written and full of suspense. However, the author puts too much of his own fantasies in it: the hero is too perfect to be true and his agenda is too politically correct. The plot is good, though, and it would make a good movie."
2,Disappointing,"I am a great fan of Patterson's books, and have oft times preferred reading his writings to those of John Grisham. But I am sorely disappointed in NO SAFE PLACE. This is not a mystery of any genre, but a story of a love between a presidentail wannabe and his soul-mate. All in all, I suppose this was a good read, as I did finish the book, but it is not Richard North Patterson at his best. If he wishes to change his writing venue, please let us know!"
1,Patterson has given us no safe place from boredom here!,"I have read most of R.N.Patterson's books - and the enjoyment quotient has ranged from moderate to high. Had to give this one up after 200 pages: insipid, putrid, shallow, and BORING!! The characters are stark and wooden - the pace that of a martini-soaked snail. I felt absolutely no empathy with anyone in this grotesque political melodrama - it almost made ""election 2000"" seem exciting in retrospect! Yes, I have given up reading Richard North Patterson for lent - and maybe for life."
1,Boring; very slow read,"This was one book I could not wait to finish. Politics aside, even the story was choppy. Very slow, mostly uninteresting characters. I will not buy another one of his books."
1,Disappointing compared to any of Patterson's previous works.,"Getting through No Safe Place was a challenge in itself. Having had great expectations going into the novel I was disappointed in the story's weak story line, lack of suspense, and for Patterson, sub par writing.I have read all of Patterson's previous works and there is no question that No Safe Place is his worst! I realize he tries to cross the line from the legal thriller to a ""political"" thriller, but is unsuccessful."
2,"Joe is a gifted writer, but this is not a good book","I have not read Joe's work before but it is clear that he is a gifted enough writer to make a decent living at it. I imagine that writing directly about yourself is much harder than doing a hatchet job on another author's work. (So few writers, so many Amazon reviewers...) Joe swings the axe like the tough kid from Philly, but his search for Sainthood by embracing shade grown coffee and cruelty free products just isn't genuine enough to be funny. I am sure any of his other articles that he excerpts indirectly in a long list of apologies for former misdeeds are much better. Save your money and read Joe's next hatchet job in Playboy or Rolling Stone. Joe is a gifted writer, but this is not a good book."
4,Great smelling cachet!,I wish I could afford to have one of for every drawer and closet! The fragrance is so realistic that I can close my eyes imagine I am in the middle of the forest!
1,Ripoff,The pick guard took over a week to arrive. What I received is nothing like the photo. The photo makes it look like this thing has a nice round edge. What I received is a crappy piece of plastic with a straight edge that looks like it was cut by a first-grader. I couldn't be more disappointed.
4,Pretty good with the new face of Sybex,"I owned more than 10 Sybex Mastering serial books including Mastering Photoshop 6. Actually, the cover of this book is not interested me at the first time. But the price of this book was attracted me. If you are new to Photoshop, this is a good start for you. But if you are familar with Photoshop 5 or above, this book is not for you."
4,not for every child,"A great book deserving of all the accolades given it. EXCEPT it's not for every child.Kids in foster care, and children adopted at older ages, may find the first part too real, too scary, even nightmare-provoking.Bud goes from an orphanage to the foster family from hell. Feedback from the population I just mentioned (in elementary school) has been overwhelmingly negative; brings up too much they'd rather forget. As an adult, I enjoyed the book. And I suspect that the vast majority of children from safer family backgrounds would enjoy it, too, as pure fiction to them, not reality."
4,Jazz Boys,"This book was hard to put down! I would recommend this book for those who like a story filled with adventure and a heart-warming ending. This story is very easy to follow along and the message is clear. Every chapter ends with a cliff- hanger! Curtis' adaptation of life during the depression was believable. If you enjoy a fast read, and can enjoy a child's view of what life is like at that age, you'll love this book."
5,Bud-Not-Buddy,"If you love mystery books, and at the same time fun books,read Bud-Not-Buddy. It is an enthusiastic book. It talkes about an orfan that faces very bad times. It includes a boy that tries to put a pencil in Bud`s nose, and a vey bad and evil vampire. But what Bud really wants is to find his father, that is a famos musician, but he just knows the name of the band, that is """"The Dusky Devators of Depression"", and of course his father's name, that is Herman E. Calloway. Bud-Not-Buddy is a very funny book. This is one of Chistophers Paul Curtis famous book, that also has some parts of his other book, Bud Caldwell's Rules for having a funner Life and Making a Better Liar out of Yourself. Read Bud-Not-Buddy and never forget things about life.Daniela"
5,this is a great book!,When I was in fourth grade everyone had already read this book. I was stuck aloneand i didn't want to read it. Finnally in 5th grade I decided to read it. I completely regrete it that I didn't read it in fourth grade! It is a great book to learn from I thought the rules were funny that bud followed. The time in that part of history was horrible. If you read this book be sure that you knoww what time period it's from! it's just a great book that show how Budd survived back then.
5,"Bud, Not Buddy was a great book!","This book was really great, I really enjoyed it. It is about a young boy in the 1930's, who is on a mission to find his dad. He has many adventures trying to find his dad. I highly reccomend this book."
5,An absolute delight,"Curtis has created a real and unforgettable character in Bud. The reader is taken in at once by this boy's good-natured response to some extremely unfortunate life circumstances as child from an orphanage in Flint, Michigan during the Great Depression. Bud's sense of humor, rules for living and determination carry him through his quest to discover his father and find a true home. My enjoyment of the book was heightened when I learned that two of the characters were based on the author's grandfathers."
5,My mom made me read this book!,"I thought this was a great book. There was a lot of adventure, humor and great characters. I also liked the way Bud had flashbacks from previous times.The other cool thing was that Bud was my age and was totally on his own even though he had a lot of help from friendly strangers. Another reason this book was really neat was that it was very suspenseful. I couldn't wait to finish it.I give this book 5 stars - you should read it, too."
3,Not Very Interesting,We had to read this book for 5th grade and it wasn't very interesting. I agree with the other reviewer who said that it was obvious that he was going to search for his father. I really don't know what happened in the book either. All I know is that a boy named Bud is searching for his dad. That is all I can think of off the top of my head. I did not enjoy this book but I did read another book by Christopher Paul Curtis called The Watson's Go To Birmingham 1963 and I liked it much more for some reason. This book was okay but not the best I have read.
5,"Bud, Not Buddy","This adventure and fantastic book is about a boy named Bud. He lived in a Foster home. After Bud went through cruel treatment at a home, he decides to runaway and go to who he thinks is his dad. This is an amazing story with a surprise twist in the end."
5,Teaches Values to Kids,"This was one of the first chapter books I read with my six year-old son. It was a thoroughly engaging, sensitive and delightful book that explored many harsh realities. I recommend this book whole-heartedly to parents because it demonstrates the values of perseverance,kindness and humor."
4,bud not buddy,I liked this book because it was about a journey a kid takes to find his father.I liked the main character Bud because he was a joker and a kid who keep going on.The best part of the book was when Bud told Herman his mother's name and they realized that they were related.
4,"Bud, Not Buddy, Not one to Miss","I'm a teacher and I read this book during my Christmas vacation. I thought that the book was really good. I gives children a chance to read the story about Bud and learn about what it was like to be black, poor, and parentless during the 30's. There is a wonderful ending to the story when Bud finds out were he belongs and that everything in his like will be fine. Curtis doesn't base this story on anyone that he knows but he does place characteristics about two grandfathers into the story. Children would love this book because it is action fill and keeps their attention."
5,Great read,"Bud was a strong young man with a lot of fortitude. He never seemed to lose his ability to trust no matter what devastations he had gone through. He set out to find a father, but found much more in the process."
4,Buy this book todsay!,If you like adventure stories then this is the book for you. this book is about a boy named Bud who's trying to find his father after his mother died. On the way to find his father Bud meets up with his friend and goes through a cardboard village. He meets new people and gets a ride to Grand Rapids. This book was good because it had a lot of detail and interesting parts. If you read this book you'd wish they'd made a second one.
3,easy-to-read coming of age tale of a smart kid in the Great Depression,"Ten-year-old Bud, living during the Great Depression in Flint, Michigan, was left after his mother's death with only a suitcase of band fliers and a bag of stones. He leaves his latest foster home and ventures on a Steinbeck-like odyssey to find his father--whom his believes to be the man on the fliers. Excellent coming of age tale that beautifully captures the voice of both a young adult and the time period. Grade: B+"
2,A very sad and suspensful book,"Bud Cadwell is on the run from his foster home to catch a train going west where he wants to find his father and have adventures. He thinks he finds his father when he sees a band play, and believes that he has finally found his home when he learns some interesting facts about his so-called father. I think this book was sad in a way, but needs to have more action in it. I would recommend this book to anybody who like lots of adventure and likes to read sad books."
4,Very good book,My 13yr old grandson read it and wanted me to read it also. I loved the story and enjoyed sharing and discussing it with him.
4,"Bud, Not Buddy",This book was great! I liked it because it was adventurous and suspenseful. I think if the book had an epilouge I would have given it the whole five stars but at the end you are kind of left hanging about what happens to Bud.This book is about a 10-year-old boy named Bud who is an orphan. He goes in search to find his dad. The man that Bud thinks is his dad is really his...
