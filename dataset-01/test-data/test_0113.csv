1,this is horrible,horrible horrible horrible!!!dont waste your money this is the sorriest excuse for a movie ive ever seen!!!
2,Stinky Scent,"I must preface this by saying I am not a big fan of strong and heavy scents unless it is a hot date night and the weather is cold. With that said I found this scent way too strong and heady. I thought it was said to have spicy overtones, but I personally just found it stinky! I love most CK scents particularly the unisex lines and the mens scents, but this one.....not so much."
2,Don't buy,"First off, I bought this model when it was brand new several years ago. It was my first purchase of its kind. The sound quality was mediocre at best. I probably should have done my homework before hand. Within the first few weeks, the dvd open/close tray stopped functioning, dvds/cds would just spin and not play, or at times not spin at all. The Display light would dim and just flutter. When that happened, the system would not work at all. I could not turn it off. I would have to unplug the system and plug it back in. Eventually, the dvd/cds would not spin or load at all and the tray would function partially and become stuck in a quarter to half open position before it finally just stopped working all around. This system is garbage. I have spoken with multiple professionals who work on electronics and they all have said that the problems I describe are common with this model. DO NOT BUY IT!!! You'll be sorry."
5,Its great,"I'm very happy with the Phillips, I oscillated between that and several other flat screens, but I enjoy the features, the layout and design and the instructions are pretty straightforward.Great picture,good sound quality from stereo speakers built in and it also has an M-link device that lets you hook up other devices and use your Phillips tv remote as a master.I even managed to get the close caption to work in English on a DVD that was in a foreign language. I had the abiltiy to turn the captioning on and off which I liked. I'm not sure if this translation feature, was just for that DVD or if it will work with others. I'll update this to let you know. But all in all. Good value for the money. No regrets!"
5,Beatles Hard Days Night,The last time I saw this movie was when I was 12 and sat thru it 15 times with my best friend... I enjoyed it this time just as much (Only with no screaming)
5,A great classic!,This is a great classic Beatles video - it really gives you an idea of how crazy the Beatles mania was.
1,Not as advertised,"I have had this item shipped to me TWICE, and both times it was the DVD, NOT Blu-ray. Hope you have better luck, but don't say you weren't warned!"
5,A CLASSIC !,"I saw this movie on it's release at the Palace Theater in Duncan, Oklahoma. I was 9 years old. Seeing The Beatles again is a magical moment. The live performances are excellent. The enery is contagious. The Beatles are having fun and it shows. John,Paul,George,and Ringo are in top form in this black and white film. The songs sound great and the action is non stop. My 17 year old daughter has been a Beatle's fan for many years. She was delighted by this film. It was like an undiscovered treasure to her. If you are a Beatle's fan this film is a must for your collection."
3,poor sound quality but still a great movie,"This was the first DVD title I bought, and I was disappointed by the sound quality. There is hardly any surround sound at all; For the most of the movie, only the center channel is used, and the dialog sounds quite muddy. When there is a musical selection, the front L&R speakers kick in nicely, but the volume is much louder. Once the song is done, the volume returns to a lower level, and only the center channel is heard once again. The only time I heard my rear speakers was during the concert scene at the end of the film. If you buy this DVD expecting true 5.1 surround, you will be disappointed. But, the film itself is still a classic."
2,Fake Widescreen,"Not that most of you will care or notice...But the DVD IS presented in ""fake widescreen,"" meaning that black bars have been applied to the top and bottom of the picture, actually COVERING UP some of the image.That's why the tops of people's heads are so often chopped off, and in extreme cases, even their eyes aren't visible (see the extreme close-ups during the performance sections of the movie, or the kid watching Ringo at the end of the ""parading"" sequence).Don't believe me? Just compare the full-frame footage in the ""making of"" specials to the film itself.They did this to ""The Last Waltz,"" ""Touch Of Evil,"" and many other good films, but people don't notice it and the studios keep getting away with it. If you truly are a Beatles fan, you'll raise a ruckus, because they've marred a truly great movie."
3,Not as good as HELP!,A HARD DAYS NIGHT was the BEATLES movie that struck a chord with the teenage girls. It was a movie that was designed to get the girls going. HELP was not. This is a movie you should rent. NO OFFENSE to AMAZON
2,what a film?? no act & wasting time!,"there is no clear story in this film. The act of the musicians were confused! The songs they played are okay! but to be honest the Beatles were a good band but not in the wide screen. That is the same childish story like their second one HELP.....if you re a die hard fans,..is ok."
1,"Great Movie, Bad DVD","First and foremost, A Hard Day's Night is a great film starring the greatest band in the history of music. The Miramax DVD of this classic film is one of the worst DVDs of alltime. The 5.1 soundtrack mix is awful and the attempted letterboxing is equally as bad since the film was not shot in widescreen. If you can get your hands on the first AHDN DVD, issued in 1997 by MPI, grab it at any cost. The MPI DVD was produced after the film was restored and had its premiere on the American Movie Classics (AMC)cable channel. It is not in 5.1 digital sound, but it's a heck-of-a-lot better than the mix Miramax came up with. Don't let my rating of 1 star fool you, however. The Miramax AHDN DVD gets 1 star, A Hard Day's Night, THE MOVIE, gets a 5 star (or better) rating in my opinion. ST"
1,bad sound quality,"it should have no stars at all for this re-released dvd. It looks good but sounds terrible, moreover this re-released was recorded in mono only. The whole songs sounding very weak. I guess it was digitally remastered but in fact it wasn't!die hard fans must be happy with it!"
1,Apple users beware ...,For reasons best known to the DVD's producers - they have chosen to ignore recognized international DVD video standards and have produced a non-compliant product which will NOT play on Apple OSX DVD players.I have no idea what other platforms are NOT supported.Very disappointing -
3,Features So So,"The orginal movie was a good teenage movie, what really makes it are the ED Sullivan performmances. However it a shame they really did not get to tour when they really had gotten famous due the mass confusion of the times. However they would have been a great band to see live sans the mass hysteria."
1,A very dissapointing DVD,"A lot of things were said about the release of this DVD. Unfortunatelly the people that were involved in it didn't care about it.Instead of giving us new things they cut out good stuff, such as the ""I'll cry instead"" intro, the trailers, and the stereo sound....the sound is very dissapointing, and the interviews, especially in disc 2 are quite boring, and don't bring anything new or exciting to what we know about the beatles.I will hold on to my old DVD version of this movie, which has a stereo sound and really more interesting things than this ""new"" version"
5,For it's time...,"For it's time this was cutting edge cinema. I couldn't begin to count the breakthrough shots. It has lost little to time. The music is infectious, and while a tribute to teen idols it is never cloying. Probably the most startling thing about it is how tame the Beatles and their music are now. When the film was shot, many in this country considered them dangerous radicals. You can't go wrong buying this DVD. The smile won't leave your faces for days."
1,Not a great Disney Movie,You expect something better from disney. Not worth the time. Ice Age was a better movie
3,"movie was nice, watch out who you get it from","i got this for a little girl's birthday present but the seller sold me something so dirty and scratched up i couldn't give this to her after all. because the seller east 2 west cds took nearly a week to send it after charging my card for it ''on the day of shipment'' there wasn't time for me to cancel this and get a clean copy of her favorite movie. i have pictures of the stains and scratches, would post them if i could. be very careful of who you get your products from even if they have a (falsely?) high positive rating here. the movie itself is fun, but you shouldn't have a seller ruining what was going to be a wonderful surprise for a sweet little girl."
4,"Good movie, some mature content","Overall the DVD was good and very much appropriate for young children. However, after a couple of weeks it had fallen to the back of his preference list. We've not watched it in over a year now. I guess this isn't so different from any other DVD we have.I would recommend this for young children. It does have a few concepts that are not appropriate, but are presented in a way that is way over the heads of children adn does have a few scenes that very concervative parents may term violent."
5,Lilo And Stitch Is Da Bomb!!!,"""Lilo and Stitch"" is my favorite Disney movie. That is cool that the Director and the voice of Stitch (Chris Sanders) Made this movie and came up with the idea for Stitch. This movie is way different from all the other Disney movies. The DVD is great, but it doesn't have the part where Stitch says: ""I'm not soft and fluffy."" I don't know what is my favorite part. Maybe the part where Lilo teaches Stitch how to Hula! Or where Stitch picks up the car and says ""Blue Punch Buggy!"" Or where Stitch says: ""I like fluffy!"" Or where he says: ""Also cute and fluffy!"""
4,This Movie is Great!,"Every minute of this movie is good. The animation is beautiful, the characters are well designed, and frankly Stitch is the Mouse house's best new addition. He matches the temper of Donald and the comedy antics of Goofy. The film keeps things going at a fast pace and never really drags or gets boring. The DVD doesn't fare as well. The menus are cool and some of the featurettes are great but the other extras are just stuff you'd find on a regular direct-to-video Disney DVD. But then this leads me to believe that there will be a two-disc special edition coming out soon! But this DVD is still worth buying for the movie alone!"
4,LOVED IT!,I loved this movie so much that when it came to the theater i work at i went to see it 8 times. one of those times i took mymother and grandparents. they loved it almost as much as i did.i cant wait for it come out on dvd!
3,Fun ... but NOT for little kids!,"OK, call me a bad mom for taking my 3 1/2 year old to see Disney movies. Never do we see a complete family (mom AND dad)in a Disney flick. But this time, we didn't expect such a poor reaction. Lilo is a BAD little girl. Yes, she has had a sad life and may be acting out, but a young child only sees a nasty, biting little girl who talks back and really never gets punished. Everyone feels bad for Lilo and doesn't stop her bahavior. So, ... yes it is a good movie, but wait until your child is 6 or more, unless you want to see some biting in your home."
5,LILO & STITCH,THE PRICES AT AMAZON ARE ALWAYS REASONABLE. IT IS GREAT TO FINALLY HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO COMPLETE MY COLLECTIONS. AMAZON MAKES SO EASY.
1,Not for young children,"I saw the advertisments and thought this would be cute and funny. Big mistake. Disney is counting on their name on this one. There is way too much violence and anger in this movie. Lilo does not attempt to make friends with anyone in this movie, except the alien. She even hits and bites another small child she is angry at. She is being raised by her sister and they are watched by a social worker who threatens to take Lilo away from her because she is not taken care of. How do you explain such problems to a small child. Children like to mimic and act out things they see on TV, so I would not want my child screaming at me in defiance everytime I made a request of him or locking me out of the house. Please rent this first and screen it for yourself before letting any child watch it."
1,Deeply Disappointed,"I have just seen the DVD and I can't believe that so many liked this film. The characters are very hard to like and the constant violent behavior (with no consequences) was shocking. The inconsistencies in the story really ruin it. Please rent this movie before buying it; I wouldn't have it in the house, myself."
5,The Best Disney Movie since the Fox and the Hound,"The critics rated this movie well and it deserves it. It is a truly entertaining movie that can be watch by anyone and still be thoroughly enjoyed. It also teaches good morals to little kids, if you care about that sort of thing. One thing that supports it, and you'll notice it, is all the little humourous quirks they fit throughout the movie, ie: the character Pleakley has two toungues, the weird language Stitch uses and Lilo's facination with Elvis.It's a 5 star kids movie and it's worth buying if you have any kids at all!"
2,what a disappointment,"Yes, I was saddened by the first scenes. Lilo fights with herfriends instead of talking things out. Her relationship with her sister is scary too. There are too many ""nice"" movies out there. Don't waste your money. Buy a traditional family movie.Disney please go back to good family values."
3,It's good for the family! From children to adult.,"We love LILO & Stitch, it's very nice to watch with whole family together!we like it!!We can teach to child, you are so lucky how you are live in your life now!"
5,We Love This Movie!,"My two year old, husband, and I all love ""Lilo & Stitch."" My daughter loved Stitch, the music, and the colorful images. My husband and I loved the humor and message of the movie.I highly recommend ""Lilo & Stitch."" It's a great Disney movie and one the whole family will love."
5,Wow!,"Definitely the best Disney movie I've seen in ages. I've been sorely disappointed in Disney films for awhile, but not any longer! This film is fun and had me rolling with laughter, but it has a lot of strong family values as well. It's been awhile since Disney was able to move me so much with an animated film, I'm so happy to see they still have the magic. :)"
5,Hilarious,"Funny, Funny, Funny and very touching. A wonderful movie with a wonderful message. Everyone can identify with the message in this one."
2,Lilo and Travelin Tyke,"I was not so impressed with this video. Yes the animation is great, but the story line is a little dull and both of my children had a very hard time keeping their interests up ..."
2,Too much filler,"I gave this video two stars, one each for Angel and Shana. I'm sure you'll find a model to your liking, but this was slim pickings."
4,Works okay,"Works quite well actually, but when wires are placed at the right angle all sounds stops processing through it. Quite a pain."
1,Must have received a bad one....,"After reading reviews I figured this would be the safest, most reliable converter to go with. I was wrong...or unlucky. In short, it was a piece of junk....such, in fact, that it almost damaged my equipment. The issue; once plugged into an amplifier this item would send a very high amplitude signal of distortion through the amp and to the speakers...so strong that it would blow fuses in my amp. So I opened it up and just grasped the circuit board with my hands to shield it...sounded great. So, I turned down the gains (on converter) and shielded all the components (homemade style). It now looked like crap but sounded better. However, certain electronics not, even plugged into the system, would cause a loud buzz when on (not a grounding issue) In sum, junk...overall build quality, laughable...I expected that at this price point, but no one should receive a product that just doesnt work. I must have just received a bad one."
1,Didn't hold up,"Ace got me the part quickly. After I installed it I attempted to make an adjustment to the gain levels and the knob broke off. I returned the part and got Amazon credit, not a credit card refund. I'm sure that the fine print told me that a return would be handled like that, just didn't seem right to me. I think this ended up costing me like $8 to return due to shipping so I ended up loosing at least $8 on a defective part. This wasn't a great on line purchase experience."
5,INCREDIBLE !,"I have been reading Stephen King since the age of 16, and I have been purposefully leaving ""The Stand"" until last, and it has certainly been well worth the wait. It is without doubt the best horror book ever written. The building of characters was superb, and the adrenaline it maintains throughout is astonishing. The main characters of Stu Redman and Larry Underwood, and not forgetting the one, the only Nick Andros where one the same par as T.S Garp. I thought King had provided the ultimate with Classics such as It and Salem's Lot, and I was constantly impressed by more recent novels, especially Insomnia, but this went above the high expectations King has set in my mind. A mandatory read for everybody."
2,zzzzzzzz.......,"I have to aggree with the reviewer below who gave the book a ""1"". The only thing that kept me reading was the belief that finally something would happen -- it never did. All we get is some needlessly wordy account of people treking across the country only to find out that they have nothing to do with defeating the enemy. What a joke. It has a good premise, but fails miserably in its objective."
2,Waste of time,"I won't give too much info of the book but Chapter 58 really MADE ME MAD. One of THE main characters, I won't say his name (he was introduced in Chapter 9) DIES before the climax even started. A character, that we spent over 400 + pages reading about, just dies like that. WHAT THE HELL? Who cares if that woman (Starts with an S) dies, or the others, but HIM?!?!? He was my favorite character and he died like a sucka! This dude was a VERY important character... I just wasted 200-400 pages on a character that dies before the climax even starts.... :( King should've left out (him) so we don't have to waste 200 pages on him. ARGHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If he would've died, AT LEAST in honor or something, or near the end, I wouldn't be so mad. But he does when there is only 260 (+) pages left?!?!??!? WHAT THE FUGG??!??!?!?!?I gave it a 2 instead of one star because up until Chapter 58, the book was fugging great!"
3,Avid Reader of Sci-Fi/Fantasy,"This book lacked any reason to read after everyone reached Boulder and Vegas. Up till then the story was great. Swan Song was a much better book and I suggest to anybody that liked The Stand, Read Swan Song and see how an apocolyptic book should end. Even with that in mind The stand is not a bad read ."
2,King's most overrated novel,"I've never understood why The Stand is held in such high regard. It is not very original; it is way too long; it is boring; the characters, for the most part, are not interesting; and it has the worst anti-climax of any of his books."
4,Great book...epic in scope!!!,"I dind't give The Stand five stars because I was expecting a bit more ""horror""...I wanted to really be scared by Randall Flagg, and he didn't scare me as much as I was expecting. But other than that, the cast of characters, the epic scope across the entire USA, the battles among good and evil, saying goodbye to characters I was invested in, etc...all of it made for a truly memorable reading experience and I'm now much more interested in reading The Gunslinger novels because of it :)The Stand is highly recommended!!!"
4,The Cut Version Was Better,"I'd give the original (judiciously edited) version 5 stars, this one four. The uncut version drags -- a few times I found myself wanting to give up on the rest of the book. I don't remember feeling that way at all when I read the edited version, about 15 years ago. King spends way too much, for instance, on Franny's inner thoughts and on the old Granny's character development. It's not thoughtful writing, either -- you feel like King's just on autopilot in these parts."
5,A book to rival the heavyweights of the world's fiction!,"The Stand. A place to make your intentions known and to take full responsibility for them.Our government, through science and technology, manages to wipe out 90% of the human population. Good and Evil manifest themselves in two of the most unlikely characters: one a drifter with a more than an unusual past; the other a hundred and eight year old black woman.Building to one of the greatest climaxes in fiction history, King reveals the flaws and impurities of evil right beside the glory and overwhelming justice of good. Beautifully told and written! This book magnifies the King writing style to it's fullest degree"
5,The best book I've ever read!!!!!!!!,THE STAND was the first Steven King novel I ever read. After that I vowed to never miss another story he penned. His characters are so real that I wept as my favorites died one by one. His use of biblical quotes and rock lyrics to emphasize the fight between good and evil in a final confrontation is ingenious.I have recommended this book to everyone I know who enjoys reading. I did feel that he could have cut the end (everything after the climax in Las Vegas) to less than 5 chapters. That is the only time during the entire novel that I did not mind putting the book down.I also enjoy the GUNSLINGER series because they are similar in many ways to THE STAND. I have waited patiently for a long time for WIZARDS AND GLASS and am elated to hear that my wait is almost over.
5,King's Magnum Opus,"This is the deinition of a masterpiece. The characters are deep, diverse, and well managed. You really care about these people after getting to know them. King really builds them well. The story is really fantastic, well thought out, and delivered expertly. This book will scare you. It will make you laugh. You will most likely shed a few tears. You will cheer. You will be angry. You will ponder deeply your own beliefs. But most of all, you will love it, every single page, period. I loved this book and would recommend it to any avid reader."
2,Can't finish it,"I was on a reading frenzy for the past few months, and most of those happened to be SK books. I have enjoyed nearly every Stephen King book, particularly the short stories. So, after reading reviews about ""The Stand"", I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, I just cannot finish it. It took me a month to get through about half of it, and I'm a fast reader. I could only read a few pages at a time before I just got bored and set it down again. I gave it two stars because there has to be something in there that makes so many people call this his greatest work. I'm guessing it's in the last half. Oh well. Can't please everyone."
5,Could Not Put It Down,"Classic battle good against evil. I could not put this down; though there are some slow, long winded areas. I am an early Stephen King fan; I read this long ago and was a little disappointed that some things were left out in the Kindle edition, but I still loved it!!"
5,One of the best books ever,The Stand in my opinion is truly one of the greastest books of the century its up there with the shining and the lord of the rings.
5,"THE best apocalyptic novel of the 20th century, hands down.","For those of you familiar with King's normally gruesome prose, this book is a special treat. It is the epic saga (at over 600 pages, I use those terms literally) of the end of humanity, and the final battle between good (led by a 108-year old woman) and evil (led by a demon simply known as the ""walkin' dude"". ) A classic in horror-- the tv series doesn't do it justice. For those who have never read King's work (all three of you) this novel is a great place to start. One question lingers, though-- why does the walkin' dude name always have to be ""R.F.""?"
2,ZZZZzzzzzzzzz....,"I confess to being a King fan, god knows there are enough of us about so it isn't shameful, but in this case I find myself having to say....... Oi! Stephen, NO! The book is overlong,(Apparently it was originally less of a handful but Stephen decided not to leave well enough alone) and, although it at first seems promising with a good initial premise, it rapidly descends into an overextended yawn-fest. Do we really need to know the history and motivations of every sub-character who has even a peripheral involvement in the main plot? After it's promising start I was disappointed to discover that the book dissolves into a cliched battle between good and evil. Stephen can do much better than this, If you don't believe me try reading The Shining or Christine."
3,The Stand (Uncut Edition),"I've read many Stephen King novels and many of them I totally liked. In fact I thought I would never read a book of his and not like it. The Stand was an excception. I found it to drag and I really saw no reason as to why some of the things happened the way they did.It took me about 4 months to read this because it was just not interesting enough to capture my attention. However, even with all of that overall I thought it was good and I would recommend it to only the fans of Stephen Kings. If you just happen to pick it up, it wouldn't really be a good book to read."
2,Ho Hum,"I've heard of Stephen King for years but I never read any of his books because Horror books are not my cup of tea. But when I discovered he had written a book dealing with surviving after the population of earth had been reduced by almost 98 percent, I knew I had to read it. But first I read the reviews on Amazon.Com and found it appears a large number of readers loved it and an almost even number of readers hated it. I decided I would read it and make up my own mind. Had I not read the reviews I would have quit reading it around chapter 3. But I FORCED myself to finish the book. Boring boring boring. I am presently reading Swan Song and hope it deals with the subject better than King. Very disapointed."
3,"a good tale, but this is hardly literature","This was recommended to me enthusiastically by a special pal as a great and deep novel. As I had never read anything by King I thought I wd slog thru it, though horrer is not my genre. Alas, I was really disappointed not only by the writing but by the characters and plot. Whle this is not potboiler stereotypical, it isn't much more than a hodgepodge of Biblical references in an apocalyptic setting and some characters that are barely more than 2-dimensional. What it boiled down to for me was that I cd never quite suspend my disbelief and forget the fact that this is something that someone was making up, with all due rspect to the way King executed it. As such, it can be fun, but don't expect anything more than that, such as the slightest psychological depth or a style that is better than hurried."
1,The Price,I was looking forward to buying this book once it was available...but I find the cost of this book to be too expensive. WHY!
1,GET THE REGULAR VERSION,"Unless you're a fan of King's overembellishment, this release is a complete waste of time. If you're a die-hard King fan, I highly recommend it. If you're a casual reader of his works (like me), who is constantly annoyed by the extra 300 pages that always seem to come after the point any other writer would stop writing, just get the regular version"
1,Another battle of good vs. evil,"Surprise, Surprise. I am once again dissapointed by one of Stephen King's so called ""books"". It is my opinion that while Stephen King may have some good ideas, he's just not a very good writer. The Stand began well; portraying a very possible scenario of a government mistake in a bio-chemical lab. It decimated the Earth's population, leaving only one percent remaining. It is after this epidemic however that the story goes down hill with the introduction of the Terror Element. The story Climaxes at the beginning, has a barely tolerable middle, and comes to a screeching halt at the end. Please Mr. King, spare us more of this crap. Just stop writing or give your ideas to someone who knows what thier doing."
5,The Best Book I've Ever Read,"My boyfriend bought me this book for Christmas, and I couldn't put it down. I thought it was excellent, certainly the best book I have ever read:)"
3,this is a cheesey book,"""oh my god! look out behind you!"" is what you would be reading if you bought a book other than this one. the stand is not a book for people that like suspence and horror and all that other good stuff that makes a STEPHEN KING book.personally, i think that some cheesey author wrote it and payed KING to sign his name to it just to get people to read it. this book just didn't have all the properties of a classic STEPHEN KING HORROR STORY. frankly it scares me to look at his name on the book. it's just a cheesey story and that's all you really need to know. i wouldn't waste my time or money on it."
2,Not one of his best,"Unless you are a die-hard Stephen King fan, this book is not for you. I found this book to be way too long. Although, to the King fan, this book is the typical. My favourite books by this author are CUJO, The Dead Zone and Misery; with Misery being my all-time fave !"
5,An engrossing and electrifying book!,"Out of the many books I have read, this is, if not the best, than definitely one of the best. The lives of the characters are probed deeply, allowing us to feel what they are going through. The plot is not far-fetched, but bases itself on a danger the world must recognize in today's society of biological & chemical technology. An earlier comment criticized the ""heroine"" as being a giddy school girl. I would like to point out that heros are not born dignified and noble. It is how they handle times of crisis that makes them heros, of which there are plenty in this book."
5,The Stand stands alone,"When Captain Trips wipes out 99.8% of the populations it takens amazing psychic forces to group the people remaining under Randell Flag and Mother Abigail. This is a novel of triumphs, of the war between good and evil, of romance and horror and the instinct of survival. It has strong characters who interelate in a building up to the Ultimate ending. What could be worse than almost everyone dieing? - Read and find out. There are not very many reasons to visit America(sorry Yanks) but to follow the path that Stuart and crue travelled. No one has captured the 70's paranoia of self distruction than Stephen King and here in the 90's it still holds and twists the human imagination. See you with Mother Abegail. M-o-o-n - that spells excelent."
1,WRONG book,"I bought the (Spanish Edition) of ""The Stand"" by Stephen King and the book I received if the English edition. That was the only problem so next time you have to be more careful about language matters, i can read in both languages but if i buy a book in Spanish that's what i expect. Shipping was normal and the book is in good condition. I understand these things happens, that's why i'm writing this review. Thanks."
2,The Pitiful Mr. March,"Geraldine Brooks' Year of Wonder was an excellent read. For this reason I bought March.While it was also beautifully written the main character, Mr. March was a total dissapointment. After reading all the adoring and eloquent letters written to his wife and daughters while he was at war, I was very disappointed when he had an affair with Grace. I lost my patience and considered him an idiot when he suggested the sheep should be allowed to keep their wool, the cows should be allowed to keep their milk for their calves and I can't remember what the chickens were supposed to do with their eggs. I went to the last page to see if he got shot during the war but allas, he made it home to his loving family. Pity."
2,More book than anyone really needs...,"It is long...very long. And it when it was over, I was happy. Not because I felt enriched, but because, simply, it was over."
1,"If there's a more boring book out there, I haven't found it","First of all, let me clarify a couple of things. I LOVE reading fiction, especially sci fi and fantasy. Also, I am a fan of some of King's works -in my opinion, he wrote two of the most entertaining tales ever in The Talisman and The Dark Tower. But boy did he screw up on this one. I read more than half of his books, and never thought he would be capable of writing such an incredibly LONG AND BORING BOOK. Take my advice, it's not worth going through the whole thing. Read The Talisman or The Dark Tower books instead."
3,The Stand,"The book covers soo many people that I cant get emotional over anyone getting sick and dying. I have had no problem laying the book down many,many times..."
5,The Stand,This book is the best book I have ever read. It is the first book I read that Stephen King had written. It entertained me for the week it took me to read it. I have read it maybe four times and it just gets better every time I read it. I had to put it on my Kindle Fire so I would have it in case I needed to read it again. I have the hardback book of The Stand and now my Kindle Fire has it so I'm all set. I love the book and was so glad I could get it for my Kindle Fire.
5,ITS TIME TO MAKE YOUR STAND!!!!,"This movie was one of his best. Even though this book wasn't one of his favorites, its defiantely alot of other peoples. It sort of keeps you on your feet on whats going to happen next. In some parts, I thought it was very emotional...... This was a really good book and the movie was EXCELLENT!!! Stephen King is such an awesome writer!!! He can keep people on their feet and what not! LOVED IT!"
5,"Oh, please!","I see there are still people complaining about this book. Ha ha ha! You get the USA population (well almost 99.9% of it)wiped away (along with the rest of the world) there are two poles: Bad and good; there are several extremely likeable characters(I don't know why but Stuart is my all-time favourite hero); there are nightmares, there is crying (remember Larry losing his mother? Or Susan's death), laughter, dawning, betrayal, promises and broken promises, hope, humanity, insanity, cannibalism, other-worldly things, an epic journey, small-town nightmares, action packages full of vivid tales, several frights, even a nuclear bomb and a fantastic display of post-modern, capitalism-kneaded, material USA. And I ask you: What does a reader want more? and what's better is that this is served to you by one of the most talented figures in the 20th century.Respect please!"
5,The Stand review,"I read the original published version of The Stand when I was in junior high school. I fell in love with this story way back then. The way Stephen King takes you into his world is amazing: you see the places, you meet the people, you become involved and that is the true wonder of his books. I have read this story more than once and I still enjoy it. If you have never read this book, I would urge you to do so soon. Some of the backgrounds are dated (late 70s-early 80s), but the story is current and interesting.Read this book!"
1,I threw mine 18 metres with wind assistance,"I heartily agree with the reviewers who find this book, too long, too dull and too boring. Luckily the bookshops on Khao San Road do trade-ins. Am I the only person in the world to think that Randall Flagg is the most tiresome bad guy ever to appear in print. What is King's obsession with this guy ? Let's have more psycho nurses with blow-torches Mr King and less adding another 500 pages of drivel to an already drivel filled book. Riveting, is something I'd rather do than read this again."
4,"VERY long, but worth the time","This is probably the longest book I ever read, and it certaintly took a very long time to read, but it was enjoyable all the way.It is a very interesting topic, the idea of a desease clearing out 95% of the population, and King decides to take a very epocoliptical good vs. evil, ""magical"" type look at it instead of actually thinking about the logical course of action for people. That being said, the book still does a great job developing charecters and relationships, as well as exploring some of the interesting facets of a small city run completely by survivors, for survivors, like a new chance at starting the country over fresh.Certainly worth the time it takes to get through 1150 pages, interesting, inciteful, if occasionally far-fetched. Quality read."
2,Not the great man's best,"My favourite King book of all time has to be Misery which is such a classic page-turner it kept me up till well into the morning. This book however took me two months to read, with a three week break included. It struggles to get going, struggles to maintain any narrative pace and finally struggles to a ""so what?"" ending. Astoundingly it is not as bad as Salem's Lot which I refuse to ever read again. Maybe I'll try this one again but not until I've got a good month to kill, or if I'm stranded on a desert island with nothing else. Just out of curiosity I did manage 15 yards in my rear garden with it."
2,Interesting concept but unbelievably bloated,"I like Stephen King and this is a great idea for a novel, BUT here are the facts: this book is in desperate need of an editor who isn't afraid to tell Mr. King (no such person, I'm sure) that his book is WAY too slow. If you like reading novels that unfold with all the speed of growing grass, this book is for you. I got half-way through and had to put it down. These characters are not nearly interesting enough to sustain 1000+ pages! A frustratingly slow read that is both self-indulgent and ultimately uninteresting. I would have given it one star, but it did keep my attention for a little while. The Shining is so much better."
5,"Once you pick up this book, you won't be able to put it down","The Stand, is by far the best book I've read (2 yrs ago). I love the realism of the story. The movie is excellent as well. This book will leave you in awe."
3,Trying,"I bought this book because so many readers said it was great. Well, I tried but just couldn't. It was way too long and the good vs. evil battle is just a bit much. How many devil vs. god books do we have to read. It's such a boring overplayed subject and the characters are so Disney and predictible. It just rambles on and on and I realize that so many USA writers follow this type of format. I have to wonder what sort of education these SK lovers have had. This book made me think I wasted my money. It sure as heck didn't scare me."
4,King of the Hill for SK,"The Stand is probably the most recognizable novel in Stephen King's massive literary repertoire. It is the book of all books: The mammoth story of classical good vs. evil delivered within 1,100 plus pages in this ""Complete and Uncut Edition"". In this special edition of The Stand, King leaves no stone unturned as he woes his audience, ""Dear Constant Reader"" with an apocalyptical prose about the fragility of human life and the free will in which God provides us to chose our own path. This book is very well written, as most of SK's earlier work and will certainly be pleasing to both the avid Steve King fan as well as the recreational reader. Pick this one up!"
3,wrong item,I ordered shoes an got those by accident. So I wanted to send them back and I got a refund. The only irritated thing is that this company has a return form that demands that you send it back and make sure you add insurance and tracking number and they'll refund that as well when they get their shoes back. They didn't. it was only about $6 but still... you promise something - deliver.
5,Simply Paradise,"One of the best romance books I've ever read. Loved every minute, every sentence, everything!! Absolutely couldn't put it down. This will be a keeper I will definately reread. McNaught brings you so well into the characters feels."
5,Captivating,"I can not put this down, this is a great read. There is mystery, romance and it is so sweet and somewhat realistic..:D"
4,Missing charactors,"I'm a new fan of Judith McNaught. As a second language reader, I do enjoy her books. But, after exciting of reading cool down, I felt lost in the Paradise because so many flaws made it unsatisfied. Such as Meredith's eyes from blue in the beginning became blue-green in the middle and back in blue again at the end; Lisa was a important charactor in Meredith's teenage, the closest friend Meredith ever had, but disappeared in her adult's year till jumping in with Parker; as a mother, Meredith's mother left her daughter behind entire life till end, which is most ridiculous nature. The worst of all was Meredith rejected Matt in suspicious of the murder and bomb setups after she'd claimed she'll ""love him all her life"". Unbelivable her love to Matt was so vulnerabl after all they'd been thru.But I do enjoy Judith McNaught's novels very much even they are not perfect. Upon our Chinese phylosophy, combining of all of the unperfect would always make a perfect in whole."
4,Second half is great!,I agree with a previous reviewer who said that a lot of the book was superfluous...The first half dragged..it could have been condesnsed with better results...I enjoyed it much better after Meredith and Matt met again!...Then the story and the characters come alive!
5,Fabulous,"This is one of the best romance novels I've ever read. Most romance novels are entertaining quick reads, but this was like a suspense novel. It kept me up all night wondering what was going to happen next and when Matt and Meridith were going to finally get back together. The characters were excellently developed and the book well written. I recommend it to anyone - romance fan or not. It is definately one of McNaught's best along with Perfect, Once and Always, Whitney My Love, and A Kingdom of Dreams."
3,Her other novels are better,"Her writing is much stronger for the historical romance novels. This is a contemporary romance, and I don't think she captured the way people really speak to each each other quite right. She is definitely a favorite though."
1,A poor reprise,"This CD contains many of Bobby Rydell's big hits, but for those looking to hear those old tunes you remember from your youth, you are in for a big surprise! All the numbers are ""re-dos"", done years later. They sound like Bobby Rydell was performing half-heartedly, maybe for a few extra bucks. The songs are awful. ....As for this CD, I have listened to it for the first and last time."
4,Good buy,"I own this book and have made several recipes from it. They all came out tasting the way I remembered them growing up in Haiti. My only criticism is that as the title implies, the book only provides a ""taste"" of haitian cuisine. I am still waiting for the definitive haitian cookbook, with a significant section allocated to desserts and treats. I am dying for a great haitian cake recipe, complete with frosting that I can make for my daughter -- If you have ever tasted what I am thinking of, you know that it begs to be documented for the ages and should not disappear or remain the secret of a few families. I hope that the author and publisher of this wonderful book realize that their audience is clamoring for more and that they deliver."
1,Disappointed,It seems that some ingredients were not correct at all. This book should cost under $5.00 it waste of time and money. If you want haitian recipe go to a haitian restaurant ask a friend who is haitian. I bought this book for a friend after I read it I realized that I should keep sending them email recipe. Take it from a haitian restaurant chef.
3,"Fine for some things, but leaks","My springform works just fine, but if you put anyting even remotely liquid in it, it leaks. Not good. It's fine for doughy items like a German-style Kuchen or Torte where the crust keeps any liquid from spilling out, but it's inadequate for a Spanish tortilla, etc., or anything else that has a very liquid consistency."
4,Very Nice,"This Television set is best for the person that wants a good price and a large clear picture. Although the set doesn't have too many fancy options on it, it does a good job for just the usuall tv and movies. Is good for a bedroom or kitchen in particular."
1,i know urkel needs a check,"but did he check the script before he agreed to this project? this was worst than ""carmen: the hip-oprea"" (featuring beyonce)! and i bet it's in the 10 cent bargin bin with the movie ""the seat filler"" (also featuring deRay davis)no one in this movie had any chemistry between them. every 7th word was peppered with profanity. i did not laugh once and actually found myself cheering because it was finally over.the plot is thin and thoughtless. the cast is corny and catastrophic.unless you've been imprisoned for the last 12 years and are forced to watch this, i wouldn't suggest that you waste your time, money or energy on this film."
1,THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE ! ! ! !,Do not watch this one. A complete waste of time. Watch DUPLEX instead.
1,Lame!,"I rented this movie (thankfully, a free rental) because I love Hallie Todd as an actress. She's the only saving grace in the movie. She's hysterical, and quite a departure from Jo McGuire. The rest of the movie, YIKES! It's definitely the lowest form of humour. It has a great premise--uptown yuppie family visiting a family of hippies who are extremely backward. However, it falls flat. Unless you're a ""die hard"" National Lampoon's fan, skip this movie (or rent it as a free rental). I rented it free, and still felt I paid too much (in gasoline!)."
5,Fabulous book on slots!,This book is highly recommended. It gives solid strategies that have already saved me hundreds of dollars. But it is also so much fun to read. The writer knows how to tell a story and he has some of the most interetsing stories about slot players in his book. His interview with Mr. Handle about where the loose machines are placed is worth the price of the book. I also liked his section on the Darwinian Slot Selection System. You won't be bored reading this book and you will learn a LOT!
5,This set the standard,"When you read the other books on slots, you immediately become aware of the fact that they are lifting piles of information from this one book and structuring their book around what Scoblete says in this book. So why read dry leftovers when you can read the juicy original. This is the one and only slot book for those of us who love to play the one-armed bandits with a chance of bringing home some money tonight!"
4,"Enjoyable, informational, morbidly funny","For those of you interested in working in the field of forensics (a seemingly popular job choice in recent times), this book is a must read. Rhine engages the reader by telling a number of tales; for example, the puzzling discovery of a body that looked female, but wearing male clothes, and how he determined the sex of the individual. He even tells us in a quite funny essay how he made enemies of the museum staff by boiling off the soft tissue of a body and causing people to vomit on the museum floor.All in all, a very practical view into the field. Rhine does not attempt to romanticize the profession; he merely tells his stories the way they should be told- very matter of factly. The book is funny at times, but his humor does not overshadow the information conveyed here."
3,Moments of Goodness in Pages of Self-Absorbtion,"Well, if you are a member of the ""Good-Old-Boys"" club in New Mexico, this is the exact book for you!! Other than that, this book only flashes occassionally with interesting notions and bright ideas. Though I really wanted to enjoy this book [and tried to do so regardless of the Self-Absorbed blather] it was somewhat of a struggle. Perhaps if the author had left out all the back-slapping self congratulatory drivel, this would have been a top-quality presentation. SIGH, you must read between the drivel to get to the content. The content is nice but too cluttered for my taste."
4,it's like getting a wig..but better!,"I actually like this product a lot. It really does provide your hair with great body, and doesn't leave it too weighed down with product or feel oily.My only complaint is that the fragrance (which does smell nice), is too strong, and I am very sensitive to most fragrances"
3,I had plans for this device,I brought this small device for my Nintendo Wii. I wanted to protect my games for future use since I've been hearing that the wii ends up breaking and all of your games lost. I wanted to prevent that from happening. However when I tried to use this device and move all of my games to that scan card it didn't work. It has some good use if you know what you are doing and have a good plan. Some games were able to move to the scan card but not all. This scan disc does have potential if used correctly.
1,wow guys...,"Surprise.... it's a normal SD card, but white.Regular SD cards will work just as well, like this one:SanDisk 2 GB Class 2 SD Flash Memory Card SDSDB-2048-A11To all you mommies and daddies who want to buy all the Wii accessories your kids are screaming for, IT'S EVEN THE SAME BRAND. Buy the cheaper one and let me know if you can tell the difference in terms of performance. Go ahead. Try it."
2,Just don't do it!,"Was the movie thought provoking? Yes. Were there good actors? Yes. But this film studio should have hired a better editor ... or an editor at all. Apparently, this was such a work of love from the film maker, he couldn't stand to cut a minute of what he considered a masterpiece. Two an a half hours? It could have been an hour and made its point!"
2,Artsy,"Thought this would be a really good thought provoking movie but I found it to be slow and filmed for a cult following maybe, it didn't ever catch me enough to keep me interested."
1,Sucks,Me and my husband did not even finish the movie... That's how bad it sucked.We will never watch it again. I wish I would know who rate that movie so high.....
2,Horrible,Just never had legs. Would like a refund and my time back. I love the lead actress in True Blood. Her part just came off as whiny and unbelievable.
1,Movie rented - Margaret,"Boring and not worth renting. It did not peak my interest. Kept waiting for the movie to get better. Poor acting, lacked excitement, story line wasn't anything terrific."
3,"Essentially good, but many scenes could have been cut.","Spoilers! The acting was very good; so many scenes seemed very real to me. But too many scenes also seemed totally pointless. Ramon's wake & son saying he'd wanted to marry the mother? (Ramon's whole business in the movie at all was tenuous at best.) The argument with a student about the intent in a line of Shakespeare's? The landscape scenes? (At one point it was so extended, we thought the movie might have ended.) These inconsequential scenes kept getting in the way of the movie instead of adding to it. The story itself is very compelling, but the addition of pointless scenes was annoying. I watched the 150-minute version. I keep wondering if the 186-minute version made those pointless scenes have meaning by somehow tying them into the plot. But I'm sure I'll never know, because I can't imagine ever wanting to spend that many minutes watching these little vignettes into someone's everyday life again."
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,"My husband and son are highly allergic to poision ivy and so I purchased this for them. We recently went on a hiking vacation in TN and poision ivy was everwhere! They both used the block and for the first time, got to enjoy the outdoors without getting the outbreak from the poision ivy. I would HIGHLY recommend this product. I am planning on buying them more for stocking stuffers for Christmas!"
4,"Dimensions, dishwasher safe, high temperature durable","This pan is 9 1/2"" by 6 1/4 inches, or 24 x 16 x 2 cm. Consider these dimensions carefully, as for larger Toaster Ovens you may be able to have two side by side. The pan itself is very sturdy, with a blue green nonstick surface on it. The rack is sort of a ""beefed up"" version of a cake cooling rack sized to fit the pan. It is dish water safe. The rack is manufactured in China. The upper temperature limit is 550 degrees F or 290 C. Plan on using only wood, nylon, rubber or plastic tools, as the non stick surface can scratch.. This product is made by Chicago Metallic, 120 Lakeview Pkwy., Vernon Hills, Illinois."
4,He is not here to speak!,"This is not a response to this particular book. It was well written.I find all the constant questions, doubts, fears, & outright lies about Joseph Smith offensive.WHY?BECAUSE JOSEPH SMITH IS NOT EVEN HERE TO ANSWER TO THE ACCUSATIONS!"
2,disspoint,"This item was not good the directions were confusing I read it five times and use it as it was written and it just didn't slice potatoes for french fries right, I ended give this item to a thirt store it wasn't worth the money I hope someone else get good use out of it."
4,"Great basic item - be careful, it is sharp","I received this item ""hand-me-down"" from another family member. That was at least five years ago and it is still going strong. The blades are finally reaching the point where they need to be replaced so I am here looking for a replacement.As with all slicers, be very careful. Even those that are not overly sharp have the ability to slice a finger or hand.I use this item regularly because my hands do not work well with a knife. I tend to make the first several slices without the guard then use the flattened area to insert the teeth of the guard. If it doesn't slice that last slice quite thin enough for your recipe with the teeth in place, use it as a good excuse to nibble on the raw vegetable that is left."
4,I like it but...,It's a great book of strips but Amazon has it listed as having 289 pages and it had less than 100...I got it cheap so it's not a big deal but this is a warning to would be buyers
1,This book SUCKS major!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is one of the WORST thoroughbred books we've ever read!!!. Cindy just dumps her favourite horse Glory. If Heather wasn't an expierenced rider why did she get to ride Glory on the trail ride? Also it was pretty inconsiderate of her to even think of leaving her best friend and Glory to the wolves while she rode off on storm. Storm is suppose to be a big horse and she thinks she could just jump up onto his back and ride off. WE HATED THIS BOOK. DON'T READ IT!!!
4,sad sad book,"Okay, so i LOVE thoroughbred more than and book ever made, but in evry ook ther sees o be at leas one mistake. like in this book on page 96 in the 1st paragraph it says that christina would be joining the group the day before the race and then on that same day on page 97 in the 2nd full paragraph it says that Ashleigh dismunted and stretched her arms out to christina, who Mike had brought out onto to the track!!! but christinas not even there!!!but its a sad book but i loved it. i miss joanna!!!! and cindy never likes glory and more. one book shes never apart from him but of course now that he doesnt race hes not in her life anymore?!whatever i still love these books!"
5,Good and ralistic but sad,"This is one of the best books because it is so realistic. Even though this book is good it is sad, so grab a box of klenex when you read it."
1,Very disappointing,"I too was sick of non-stick baking pans and was hopeful that these pans would be a good alternative. I ordered two of them. After using them a few times for baked pasta dishes, the pans seemed to be reacting negatively to the tomato sauce and breaking down. Even more annoying are the seams in the four corners of the pans which make it impossible to thoroughly clean food out of the corners. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on these pans."
5,good action movie,this to me is so much better than the present cartoons because most of the time there is a moral to the stories being displayed by the various charters in the movie.
2,Animation Collection,Good to view but the young set do not appreciate it like we did in our younger days.
4,Academy Award winning cartoons,Video came on time and is in good condition. Given as a gift so I can't review content.
2,questionable quailty,"After installing the toner very carefully, the toner spilled in the drum. It may have been my fault?? But I do not think so. Now there are streaks on almost all documents and the print is very weak."
1,A switch for Tina Leonard,"I have no qualms rating this book a ""1"". I was bored, didn't think I would ever get to the end of this book."
5,"GREAT GAME! Horrible service, Amazon","For Christmas I bought this item for my child who is very into the likes of this product. I thought, ""What's cooler than having a video game AND a workout!?"". So, me being a very loyal Amazon fan (who buys everything from Amazon), decided to purchase it. It arrived on time. My child was VERY thrilled to play it. To my whole family's dissapointment, the EYE TOY CAMERA that was sent with the game was apparently broken. Ok, Amazon. I would rather you keep your Eye Toy Camera that's broken until you can send us the whole package that actually works.Later, my whole family played this game at the neighbors house. Extremely fun when the camera actually works. Replacement camera should be here soon. Very furious at Amazon."
2,terrible assembly instructions,"I hope you like puzzles, because the instructions for assembling this frame are so short and useless that you will end up having to figure out for yourself how everything fits together. How much would it have cost them to give a step-by-step instruction booklet? Instead they throw 40 different slats at you, none of which are labelled and ALL of them looking alike, and nothing about which slat goes on the left or right side. Be prepared to spend time taking things apart and putting them back together through a process of trial and error."
5,Quality Muffin Pan,I am slowly replacing all of my non stick cookware and doing so with the Chicago Metallic line. I have had their bread pans for over a year now and love them. The construction is heavy and can stand up to lots and lots of use. They don't warp like lessor pans when going from cold to hot or vice versa. They clean up very easily.
2,less than expected,"Unfortunately, the explanation for what this book includes in the description is an exaggeration. The entry for each author is very, very basic. It would be a good book if you are looking for a general overview of each time period and a quick synopsis of each author's main themes. Also, it's missing some of the major American authors (particularly the women)."
3,Helped me pass the CLEP American Literature exam.,"I read this solely to prepare for the CLEP American Literature exam. It's very dry material and this book didn't get me excited about it, that's for sure. But it is succinct, which is what I wanted. The only other material I used to study for that CLEP exam was cliffsnotes.com's summary of The Awakening by Kate Chopin. That and this book were sufficient, though I found the exam difficult. I got a scaled score of 65 on the CLEP exam, which is more than enough for credit."
2,Good for a while. Not so good anymore,"I bought this TV 1.5 years ago. I thought it was great for the first few months, then I gradually noticed that the picture just didn't seem as clear anymore. Now when I watch my digital cable, I can't even read small text on the screen because it is so blurry. Same thing for DVDs...forget about reading subtitles! It's very annoying and frustrating.I'm not sure what exactly is wrong with it, but I am certainly NOT happy with my TV now. I contemplated buying the Sony WEGA model, but opted not too because of the price increase. Now I see it probably would have been worth it. No more Phillips products for me.One other con, the TV is HUGE and HEAVY It's so awkward to carry, I almost killed myself moving it last summer."
1,Not the Best Nut Cracker,Chose this guy for design.Found out after I received it that it is made from cast metal. It will not last long cracking harder shelled nuts. It took 1 hazelnut to bring it to its knee's. (Lasted 2 weeks)Would not recommend this.I would recommend a good set of vise grips.
1,Do Not Purchase,"I purchased 4 of these one broke almost immediately, the others will only crack large nuts. Do not buy you will be disappointed."
1,NOT MADE to crack pecans!!,"I bought this nut cracker to crack pecans it is too big for pecans i even had large pecans and was unable to crack them with this nut cracker.i bet it will do good for walnuts and other larger nuts like that, Oh well any one want to buy this one from me let me know :). too bad for me."
2,Poor packaging,"I ordered two of these jelly roll pans and they were carelessly thrown in a box (without packing material) and mailed to me. Although they look like they could be nice pans, they arrived bent and very scratched."
4,Nice pans. How to remove the glue.,"The pans are good quality and heavy but not as stiff as I had thought.Glue is annoying but I got it off in a few steps:1) Take the label off. Some paper and glue will remain stuck.2) Wash with hot soapy water using soft sponge to get paper off and use finger to push/peel off as much of glue as possible.3) Dry thoroughly with paper towel.4) (Optional) Use nail polish remover and cotton balls to remove most of the glue.5) Use a good quality packing tape (e.g. Clear 3M Scotch tape) and stick the tape over the glue area and pull off to remove the glue. Do this under good light so you can see the dullness of the adhesive layer on the surface. Repeat as many times as necessary until the surface is uniform (no more trace of glue). Give it a final soapy wash.If step 5 is not satisfactory, do step 4 then 5. (Repeat as needed).My pan surfaces are pristine and I can't tell where the glue used to be."
4,"Great, once the glue is removed","Ok, so I thought previous reviewers were just whining about the amount of time it took to remove the glue that held the product sheet in place. However, even with using a scrubbie, Cameo metal cleaner and then Goo Gone, it took almost an hour to get all of the glue off. After that, using the pan was great! This pan is a bit lighter than pans I have bought from Sam's Club and this pan cost almost twice as much."
2,Disappointment,"I'm disappointed that it darkens with use and the insert actually states that it gets better as it darkens and improves the baking. Actually, dark utensils absorb more heat, therefore, it will indeed not improve the baking unless constantly monitoring and adjusting the heat....."
4,Short shorts make for a great costume,"Couldn't find a good pair of old school men's basketball shorts, so these were the substitute. And a good substitute they were. Very elastic waistband, comfortable and just short enough."
2,Some Fun positions some a bit odd,"This book has some fun new positions my spouse and I never would have thought of but at the same time there are some positions that are just plain odd and impossible to do if you ask me. Also, it's supposed to be position of the day for each day of the year but after about 40-50 positions, they repeat with different names. Also the book combines hetero and homosexual couples which seems a bit odd for the opposite type."
4,Good reading.,"Lucrezia Borgia has heard a voice from her past saying, ""Poisoner!"" Chased out of Rome by that accusation, she sought refuge in her new home and her new husband. Now the last thing she expected to hear was that fateful word uttered again, especially from her husband's lips.Lucrezia is now determined to clear her name. She and a few of her close friends must solve the mystery surrounding the death of her lady-in-waiting. Only then can she finally put the label of Poisoner on the correct person's head.**** Wonderfully written! I got so wrapped within the pages that I sometimes felt as though I was actually with Lucrezia, so long in the past. Great reading. ****Reviewed by K. Blair."
4,"it's "" tuck""!!!","Although we have only used this once,it seems to work fine.The first thing my grandson did was try to move it' and declared it ""tuck"". the expression on his face alone was worth the price."
5,This album is a classic 90s piece of art!,"I first recieved this album over 10 years ago for my dad's ex-girlfriend, when I was 11. I loved it so much, and brought it to a party to play... I haven't seen it since. Since then, I've been really missing it, but never actually mustered up the complete desire to get it until tonight. Anyone who loves ballad rock will love this album. It has so much depth and so many layers, its just really a beautiful contribution to the music world. Music has degenerated so much since 90s rock. Its really a sad reality. If you're just getting into 90s rock, this is a perfect addition. Its not grunge, its not alternative - its sort of its own catagory. So, give this album a chance, you'll love it from beginning to end. My favorites are ""Cherub Rock"" ""Quiet"" ""Today"" ""Hummer"" ""Rocket"" ""Disarm"" ""Mayonaise"" And ""Luna"". I like them all, but these are the ones that really speak to me."
3,Good road music,This album has been on my 'to buy' list for some time now. I can't call myself a Pumpkins fan but I have heard some of their music previously and always liked it. So having said that purchasing this album and having a few listens to it I'm in transition to being a fan. Good stirring but also haunting music that has found a home in the CD stacker to keep me company on long road trips. A recommended buy.
5,Some people just don't get it...,"This has got to be one of the best albums I have ever owned. I've owned it since 1995, a few years after it came out when I was only a kid in junior high. Since then, the Smashing Pumpkins were the greatest musical discovery of the 90's for me. Billy Corgan has got to be one of the best vocalists on this earth, regardless of how ""beyond gay"" he may be. I saw some of these other lame reviews knocking him, and sadly some people aren't on that kind of level to appreciate it. All of the tracks are awesome and the best in my opnion was ""Sweet, sweet"" because in its short duration it best shows the range of Billy's voice."
5,Best Rock Album of All Time,"I am not a music expert but I hope I know more than the average person. This is abosolutely the best rock album ever. Just so people don't think that I am just writing about something I don't know I will explain myself. After listening to a lot of music I have narrowed the best rock albums to 10. Beatles-Rubber Soul, Revolver, and Sgt Pepper: Beach Boys-Pet Sounds: Led Zeppelin-III, IV: Pearl Jam-10: Soundgarden-Superunknown: Oasis-Wonderwall: Nirvana-Nevermind. Siamese Dream is the best even though I was leaning heavily towards Pet Sounds and Rubber Soul. Just like Sgt Pepper and Pet Sounds not mush recognition was given to them until 15-20 years after their release. Unfortunately Siamese Dream has been overlooked by too many critics. It may not contain many big hits but as an album it is a beautiful, sad, tragic experience that should be the soundtrack for every teenager."
5,Artistic Incredibility,"The Smashing Pumpkins are the reason that people like grunge/alt. rock. Every song on this album has a different feel, yet they all blend together to create a beautiful musical experience. For those that like their heavy guitar riffs and searing solos, Cherub Rock, Today, Geek U.S.A. and the absolutely amazing Rocket will satisfy that appetite. For those that like the mellower side of rock, Disarm, Soma and Spaceboy are quite fulfilling. Some songs blend both qualities, like Mayonnaise and Hummer. Corgan's vocals are amazing, all the guitarwork is poignant and creative, and the whole atmosphere of the album is one of technical beauty. This album shows that good songwriters can write good songs without watering down their abilities. Buy if you like music."
5,One word. Amazing.,"I own all the smashing pumpkins albums and this one is definitely their best, although ""Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness"" does come close. Every song on this album is excellent I can listen to it from beginning to end every time. Favorites are, Today, Soma, Geek U.S.A, and Rocket. Buy this Album you won't regret it."
4,grunge,"If at any point in your life you wore flannel, black boots, had long hair, and sat in coffee shops for long periods of time then this album is a must have for your collection."
5,One of the best ever,"As a longtime Pumpkins fan, I have spent a good deal of my time listening to as much of their stuff as I can get my hands on. As great as their whole body of work is, Siamese Dream is quite possibly their strongest album. The wall-to-wall guitars fill the whole disc with a rich, fluid sound. As a guitarist myself, I can listen to every song over and over to soak in the layers of guitar on every track. The rythym section is no slouch either. The drumming on this album is as strong and solid as drumming can get. The bottom line about this album is that it has beautiful production values, outstanding songs, and just about the best guitar work you could ask for. Unfortunatly, my copy has begun skipping in the middle of 'Cherub Rock' (my favorite Pumpkins song of all time), so I'll need to replace it."
5,Best CD Ever,"This CD is really the best cd I have ever owned, a classic to say the least. Although Pearl Jam Vs. is a close second. The music on this is just straight ahead rock with no gimics as they used in other albums. By far best Pumpkins cd."
5,Best Pumpkins album of all time.,"This album is flawless. Gish is a close second, but this album is alot more polished than Gish. This album makes me nostalgic for high school and summers in Upstate NY visiting my cousins. It was a time where we had no worries and we just played baseball all day and went to parties every night. Any music that reminds you of a very specific time in your life is timeless in itself.."
5,How can I respond to such a masterpiece.....,"This album left me speechless. Buy it now. If you already have it, buy it again."
5,Very touching...,"Hi, this book narrates the story of seven students who felt love for the souls in china and russia, they were called to be missionaries abroad... For me it was really worth reading it. The movement they started is now a worldwide student movement present in more than 150 country members."
5,The Future Looks Bright with Veronica on the Scene,"I am not a professional or anything, but after hearing Veronica's ""Hope for a Brighter Future,"" I was amazed. After hearing them perform live a few times, I was impressed that their c.d.'s performance matched their stage performace, a feat I never deemed possible. The guys put the same amount of energy, talent, and fun into their songs as if they were performing live. The guitars are tight, the synth is awesome, and the drums are kickin'! The band comes together on every song and pours out raw emotion, which,in a world where the excessive teenie bopper junk has permeated the once halfway decent music scene, is something you don't see too often nowadays. Veronica is a breath of fresh air for music lovers everywhere, myself included."
4,Treetops Oustanding Classic Sound,"The song writting and production on this album are excellent. Good music from start to finish. The group had a great sense of melody with each song they wrote, and the production is a pleasing, and interesting mixture of instruments used to back up these excellent gems. Not a comtemporary top 40 radio sound, but had this album come along 40 some years ago it would reside in the uper reaches of the album charts."
4,Riding the Rails,Certainly a different view of Johnny Cash in this one. An enjoyable DVD none the less and gives a bit of history of the great era of Steam trains. Saw the video a long time ago so the DVD is a welcome addition to my collection.
3,A T.V. from JR's is a refurb,"I was surprised to see this TV listed on Amazon for ""such a good price"", it seemed too good to be true. I tracked it back to JR's website and there they list it as a refurbished TV. That info was unclear on Amazon's description."
5,Intimate Stranger Fan,I only bought this so I could finally have Intimate Stranger with Deborah Harry on DVD. I haven't looked at any of the other movies and I don't know if I ever will. But Intimate Stranger looks excellent! I couldn't be happier!
1,One out of two kits are defective - effectively,"I received this Tabletop Disco Ball and Motor Kit (MADE IN CHINA) already defective. The battery compartment door was missing and the leads to the battery pressure springs were not even soldered to the springs. Obviously it didn't work. eParty Unlimited not only sent me a new, tested working one the very next day, but they also sent me a pre-paid packing slip to send the old crappy one back. It wasn't their fault.Although the new one works as described, it is cheap and janky. The disco ball does not even sit on the cone motor straight. It tilts to one side.I would not recommend this product. It's not worth the hassle. I got lucky the second time."
3,Not as good as Razor Wire Pubic Hair,"You can tell Mr. Mellick is a talented author. I'm not a big fan of this book, but his other books are wonderful. I recommend reading ""Razor Wire Pubic Hair"" instead of this one, but if you're interested in seeing what a brilliant author writes at age 18 (back when he was an amateur) you might enjoy Electric Jesus Corpse. On the other hand, it seems that many people have enjoyed this book so maybe I'm just a snob."
5,The Sicilian!,"Better than The Godfather?? I really can't decide. Don't be fooled by people who Will tell you this is a sequel to The Godfather. It is NOT. While Puzo's Corleone family does exist in a large part of this novel, it is more of a side-car to Puzo's great mafia story. Michael Corleone is in exile in Sicily after avenging his fathers attempted murder. While there he becomes involved in a revolution in Sicily. Turi Guiliani is so much more than a bandit. Living in the mountains with his band of outlaws, he fights for Sicily's honor, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. Michael's job is to bring Turi to America to escape pursucution from the carabinieri, Italian police who are as corrupt as the Sicilian day is long.Please read this book."
3,measuring cup w/seal,"works ok but not ""whiz bang"". It will get the job done but the markings are not user friendly to us"
2,Plastic breaks easily,"The base of mine broke pretty quickly. It is still functional & works well enough,, but I still use my regular glass measuring cups first. It also collects dirty water in the base if you put it in the dishwasher, so hand washing is the only good option. It just seems like it should cost $1-2, not $8-10."
3,"Awesome Measuring Cup, Terrible Durability","The Emsa Perfect Beaker measuring cup is terrific and one of the most commonly used tools in our kitchen. It is light weight, easy to read, and quick to get the proper measurements needed. As far as product usability it gets a solid ten. The only downside, and it's a major one, is how incredibly fragile they can be. I just ordered our fourth one due to another one of them breaking. If they fall off the counter, dining room table, from your hand, etc. you will likely be ordering a new one unless you have a lot of rugs or carpeting."
4,Great measuring tool.,"This beaker is similar to the ones used by Alton Brown on Good Eats. The beaker is very light, but seems to be quite indestructable. There have been no ill effects from the dishwasher, either. My only issue with this beaker is that the concave bottom may retain water from the dishwasher depending on how it is positioned. I bought a second so that I would always have one available."
5,Only dirty one piece of equipment,Alton Brown knows his stuff. The perfect beaker is indeed the perfect way to measure out all you dry or wet ingredients. It is great to only need one device to measure out most any possible measurement you'll need.Plus it makes you feel like a mad scientist!!Great stuff.
4,Bee Bop Drums,"Very pleased with quality, durability and entertainment value of this product. Glad I got it for my grandson."
4,A vast improvement,"The last time I saw this, it was a disaster courtesy of Synergy Films. This release is wonderful. Two boysfrom The Mystic Knights Of The Sea have to spend the night in a haunted house. How can you resist? Don't even try. Just sit back and enjoy what ultimately led to the first starring roles for Blacks on television."
5,Delicious Surprise (I Believe It),"One of my favorite CD's from the first track to the last one. There are plenty of reviews with lots of thoughts on the tracks on this album - My personal favorites are ""Where Were You"", ""It's Too Late to Worry"", ""My Give a Damn's Busted"" and ""Not Going Down"". Really, there isn't a song on the CD that I don't enjoy. I make a lot of playlists for my MP3 player, and this is one of the few albums (and artists) whose material is good enough to to be added as-is to the player. If you have enjoyed her music in the past, then this is one of those CD's you should own because there is some great material on this album that will never make its way to a Greatest Hits collection, because those tracks were never released. A shame too, because I think that some of them would have enjoyed some real commercial success! I guess I'm just a fan, what can I say? Buy it, listen to it, and enjoy it!"
5,Discovering R. Girard,This book is a great addition to my Girard library in French. I wanted to be able to share my keen interest for his inspiring work and ideas with all my American friends and family. This is the perfect entry point for readers who are prepared to make the effort: this is not casual reading. But the reward in a critical look on many tough issues of our personal and societal lives is well worth it.
4,Oh Yes,"I loved David Crosby's album ""If I Could Only Remember My Name""so I was looking for other stuff he did and while not the 5 star rating I would give to that album it is quite good."
2,Poor Quality,"My husband has worn Florsheim Imperials for 30 years. A typical pair for him lasts about 5 years and undergoes at least 3 resoles in that time with no problem. In less than 2 months, wearing them only 2-3 times per week, the sole on one shoe has split. We've never seen such poor quality in a Florsheim shoe. Makes me wonder if the low cost found on Amazon means we were sold an irregular product to begin with. We have to have them repaired as he needs them right away and we cannot wait for replacement process. Not an ideal situation on a $150 purchase."
5,One of our favorites,"We bought this for my 3 year old son when my wife was pregnant with our second boy. He loved it and still does, even though he is now 5 and his baby brother is now two! Highly recommended."
4,Burroughs on signs of the season,"This book was printed and copyrighted on the day I ordered it. It's missing the intro and some other features of the book as originally printed, but I guess that this is how Amazon keeps the price low."
1,Nothing Like I wanted,This is just a basket really the use is for serving. I thought I was ordering a form to bake Artisian bread in. Very deceiving the way the use is written and it is very expensive. I do not recommend any bread baker ordering this.
3,Softwear,"I have bought this but i never got the software disk, do anyone know what website i can download it from? thanks so much"
4,<artin Cruz Smith hardly sounds Russian,"Martin Cruz Smith hardly signs like a Russian but his series of Renko novels smell of the cabbage cookin odors universally experienced in Russian apartment stairwells, and the grinding workings of the Russian apartchuk. Having worked in the Siberian Far East of Russia periodically for over ten years, Smith can both assuage and reinforce my homesickness for Russia. Evocative settings, details true to the Russian experience and great story telling keep him on my read and re-read lists."
4,corruptions shadow,"The new Russia is filled with corruption and how can one man fight it? He survives but as always with scars. There was a criticism of Russian literature as ""three men in a dark basement contemplating a dead rat"". This description fits this book. This is not to demean the book as the quality and skill to unveil the events and weave them together is excellent."
4,Watch Case,This is a very nice case that I use for travel. A very well made case with quality construction. The only negative I can find is that some of my larger watches don't fit too well and the leather bands with bands with clasp closures must be taken apart in order to be put in the case.
4,Firehouse,"The book Firehouse is about a firehouse in New York during 9/11 and after. The book shows the effects 9/11 had on the U.S. and espesially on the fire fighters in New York. The book is written by David Halberstam.The book has many messages.The one that was the most apealing was that we must carry on no matter how bad something can be.The book hits sensative subjects and it messages are very meaningful.I thought the story was good and I would recommend this book to those that want a good story. The book is deep, but makes you think about the sacrifice fire fighters make. It also makes you a bit angry at the aports that didn't detect the weapons?It's a great book. I would give this a 8.5 out of 10. It made me want to be a fire fighter."
4,4 stars for effort...,"Sandra Schneiders has in this work provided students and theologians alike with an invaluable resource on hermeneutical study, and post-modern Biblical scholarship. Her attempt to work with the text from an existentialist experience is refreshing considering the complete secularisation of Scripture by other authors. However, when engaging her example hermeneutic of suspiscion, I asked myself, ""Is this Christian existentialism or is it Feminist existentialism."" Once again, infant Christianity appears as the butt of a scholastic enterprise that projects current ideology onto ancient text, and what makes this all the more difficult is that it involves at times imaginative reconstruction. Despite its reflection of popular white middle class ethic, this book is a handy resource, if only for its dealings with 'scientific methodology', and Schneiders' immense notions of spirituality refreshingly engage Sacred text, filling a vacuum in modern academic theology."
5,Essential!,"If you are a professional, aspiring or amateur poet, this book is a must have. Part anthology, part dictionary, part encyclopedia, it provides indespensible and clear advice. There is inspiration on practically every page!"
5,Practical and useful,"Drury's book is a practical and useful book for not only writing poetry, but for teaching poetry. His definitions and examples are practical, clear, and unaffected, unlike some of the other more convoluted handbooks. A definite must have for any poet or teacher of poetry"
2,Too Strong,"I was planning to get the English Breakfast, but instead got the Morning Thunder somehow. The tea is OK, but it seems to brew too strong (strong flavored) for my liking. Definitely not a ""bad"" tea, but not one for my taste."
4,The War Trail North,"I have enjoyed ""The Real People"" series. This is the seventh installment. I didnt realize that there were that many in the series and I need to go back and read a couple that I missed somehow. Even with that, this book is a great read even without reading the entire series in order. Conley's style is very enjoyable and is a easy, fast paced read."
4,Great punk,"This album is full of energy and puts you in a good mood for a whole week at each listen! The frequent guitar solos are really good and the overall band is very together. One of the tracks (I'm trying) sounds like something Rancid could have written! That's to tell you how good this album is standout tracks are: Liberation, Final Wish, I'm Trying, Buried Dreams and Toight's the night. I only rated this album 4 stars becasue this isn't my favorite style of music but for punk and punk rock lovers this is a must have album!"
2,"Great DVD playback, but unreliable performance.","I gave this Samsung 2 stars because of the terribly unreliable performance, and because of the slow repair and customer service with Samsung.The playback on DVD's, when it works, is exceptional. The record feature, when it works, is very good for record lengths under 2 hours, and grainy on longer recordings. Menu is easy and intuitive.If this player/recorder were reliable I would give it four stars and perhaps even buy a Samsung TV. However, the player freezes, stops playing mid-movie, often won't record, and usually will not load commercially produced DVDs. It's been at the repair center for about two weeks and I still don't have an estimated repair date. If I could do it over again I would buy the Panasonic, instead."
1,SAMSUNG (Won't buy/Don't buy),The DVDR135 only worked for maybe 7 or 8 times. Since it recognizes no discs I have bought new and called Samsung who basically wanted a bunch of money for them to fix after telling me I was 2 months from my warranty that they would of extended if I called sooner which I did. They were very rude and unfriendly they had no desire to help me and basically told me they would not do anything unless I paid them money which wasn't worth it becasue it was close to what I paid for it. I will never buy a Samsung again there products are junk and they don't stand by them. My item acted up from the day I opened the box it took me a while to figure out it wasn't me and they don't seem to care.
1,A quick way to burn your money,"DO NOT BUY THIS! For the love of god DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!! My DVD-R135 worked (poorly) for about all of 4 months. I got it replaced. The next one worked for 3 months. When it did work, the sound quality was poor, and the picture had large amounts of static. If you spend money on this YOU WILL GET NOTHING FOR IT!"
2,I wouldn't buy another,"I've owned a similar Ardisam rototiller for the past 17 years. It's still going, which is good I suppose. It is definitely not the worst rototiller I've ever used, but has some significant flaws. It's too light to bite into the soil at a depth much over 4 inches. The handle adjustments seem to be for operators between 3 and 4 feet tall. And the gear box is actually two gearboxes interconnected with a threaded pipe, which leaks grease at both ends and needs to be filled at each use. Oh, and the engine needs ether to start it, every time, even when it's warmed up. I don't know how bad the competition is at this price level, but I suspect you can do better."
2,Expected More,Based on very positive reviews I finally decided to try Philosophy Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash. After using it just once I was unimpressed but I continued to use it daily and I'm disappointed to say it works no better than much cheaper drugstore brands like Neutrogena or Olay. I'll finish the bottle but won't be ordering it again. I'm subtracting one star simply because of the price.
4,Absolutely wonderful,I loved this! I love the little exfoliaters in it. They aren't too rough and they make the skin feel extraordinary. I loved how this and the hope in a jar moisturizer would make my face feel and look but the moisturizer was just too gross. If I had a moisturizer to follow this up with I would definitely get this again.
2,Example-A-Thon,I was expecting a book which showed you how to draw beautiful plans and explain the techniques used to produce these drawings. Instead this book hardly touched upon the techniques. This book is nothing more than a collection of copied architectural drawings bound together for display.
4,This is The Testament,"This book quite vividly portays israel in its birth.It is told in the eyes of the Israeli people , it surely can be a testament to all ,about the sacrifice and passion that concieved the Creation"
3,Big Rip-Off!!!!!,"What a big rip-off! I'm surprised that Amazon even has this! For one thing, the cover ""suggests"" that this is a CD of the younger Everly Brothers in concert! It is clearly made after the Reunion concert or maybe excerpts from it. And the DVD that comes with it, is laughable!!! All it is, is some unknown actors (I suspect) telling the Everly story! Most all of it straight from their biography. Although there was one curious statement in it. That Chet Atkins ""made"" them sound even younger to attract a younger audience! LMAO For one thing Chet was not their manager! And they sounded ""YOUNG"" because they were YOUNG!! A very SILLY statement! While I love EB in any form and I only paid $10.96 including shipping, I still feel this was false advertising! Amazon should be ashamed for even offering it for sale."
2,Surround Sound Missing Sound,"Nice system, however, the sound is not loud enough for the reason you would buy product like this. We had another system we bought at Walmart a few years ago for half the price and it worked great until recently. We have returned this item."
2,Do not buy,"Cheap product is what you get when you do not spend the money for something better. I should have known better than to buy a RCA product. It only took one week for the dvd player to stop functioning, all five of the trays. The only thing decent on it is the radio turner, at least that works."
3,"Basic bag, does what it should","I can't really blame the bag since it is a basic, standard stick bag as described. But if you're looking for something with many compartments or with slots to keep your sticks from sliding around, you'll be slightly let down. Also, the strap is only good for carrying in your hand, and doesn't adjust so that you can sling it over your shoulder. I have a lot of sticks which it holds just fine, but just in two big pockets inside with no separation. It has a large pocket in front and a small plastic pouch in a corner of the back which I suppose you can do something with. But if you're looking for more slots and compartments, you might want to spring for a fancier one. If you're on a budget like me though, you'll find that it will certainly hold and protect your sticks with no frills."
3,Good but not complete,"Generally a good book. But to prepare for MCSE test, this book is not enough. You will need to do your own research or read more books on topics like Index Server, if you are preparing for the IIS 4 test."
2,Disappointed,Hard to program. Too few buttons trying to do too many functions. Setting the alarm shouldn't be so complicated.Like the 3 level brightness which is a good feature for the price.
5,"Esoteric, but very intelligent and well written","For those with a libertarian bent looking for something to challenge their fundamental assumptions about liberty and democracy, I highly recommend this book. Kuehnelt-Leddihn separates the values of liberty fr om democracy, laying out a detailed, well reasoned argument for why democracy not only not the best for of government for ensuring liberty, but in fact the worst. Not necessarily utterly convincing to an American reader, but fascinating nevertheless. The second half of the book deals with the historical trends and political developments that lead up to the formation and rise of the National Socialists in Germany and Austria. Written in the 50's, it offers a different, more holistic story of the rise of the party, and links it firmly to the (Non-National) Socialist movement of contemporary Europe. Not for those looking for ""something to read by the pool,"" but for any fan of liberty and political theory, a must read."
2,One size does not fit all....,This is for relatively small to medium arms as the velcro is not very long. The padding could be thicker also to compensate for the rough material on the outside. I doubled them up and added velcro pieces to them to get them to be comfortable enough to put on and use.
2,did the job but.........,it did what it was supposed too but don't turn the knobs to far as they will break off. i read other reviews where they also had this issue i thought they might have just turned it too hard but the dial controls are crap. i would recommend using a very small precision flat head screw driver to turn the control knobs vs an all around utility driver.
2,Falls short of past Fila Brazillia efforts...,"If this is the first Fila Brazilla CD you plan to purchase, PLEASE STOP and redirect your attention to earlier works (most notably ""Touch Of Cloth""). Indeed I can't help but feel this album continues a trend started with the release of ""Another Late Night"" and continued through ""Jump Leads"". I long for the clever and classic sounds found on their many earlier albums and found myself cringing several times while listening to this cd. Having said that, there are 3 or 4 songs in the middle of the cd that I either liked, or feel might eventually grow on me. Sadly, 4 songs doesn't quite make a complete album. Here's to the old days!"
1,Burning Rubber,"Upon the first use of this product there was a burning rubber smell. I thought it might go away with time. After a month, it was still there. I contacted Waring about it and sent the product for repair. A month later they sent me back a new one. Same problem, so I returned it to Waring. Two months passed and they sent me back another one. Same issue. All in all, it's taken 5 months to get 3 blenders, all with burning rubber smells. Unless you like that smell in your kitchen DO NOT BUY. Waring would not refund my money and it's already past the 30 days Amazon will accept a return."
1,Waste of money,I bought this blender because Waring USED to be a good name. It appears that isn't the case any more.I purchased this blender specifically to make smoothies. I wanted a durable blender that would be able to crush ice. Before this one I had a cheap plastic one. The ice cracked the plastic so I figured I'd get a better quality one.I had this blender for ONE month before the blade broke. Took it in for warranty...guess what? Blade is not covered under warranty! Now this blender is in the trash.What a waste of money! Seems there are no quality products made anymore.
1,It broke after only a few uses.,"This product was a gift for the family, mostly to be used when traveling for my daughter. Beacuase of this, it wasn't used much (no more than 10 times) over the 7 months of owning it. The volume has broken. It is stuck on the highest possible level. After contacting the compnay, I was told that it is no longer under the warranty (90 days), but that I could send $85 to have it replaced (plus cost of shipping broken one back). This is just about the same cost of buying a brand new one. To me this is ridiculous. An expensive electronic device should not break after only a few uses. Too bad those uses weren't condensed into the first 90 days! I will not buy another GPX product."
5,The Best Christmas Album Ever Recorded Hands Down,"If you have never heard this album, BUY IT NOW. The entire CD only consists of songs about the true meaning of Christmas and they are all beautiful, sung by one of the most incredible voices you will ever hear. There have been many other versions of some of the songs recored over the years, but none compare to these; they still make me cry each and every time I hear them. My CD is getting a little old so I'm thinking I should buy another one to have in reserve just in case."
5,My favorite Christmas album,I must say that this is my personal favorite Christmas album of all time. The arrangements are just so nice. It has a very by-the-old-fireplace acoustic feel to it. Don Potter's acoustic guitar is just stellar throughout. This is a joyous disc to worship the Lord with during those long winter months. I keep coming back to this one every Christmas.
4,A gentle celebration and showcase,"""Good News"" is a gentle celebration in song. The melodies are low-key, quiet, and occasionally haunting. Mattea's vocals are strong, showing a wide range and delivery. Songs range from the acappella beginning of the bluesy spiritual ""Somebody Talkin' About Jesus"", to the magnificent, moving ""Mary Did You Know"". You won't find any rousing carols here, but a lot of quiet, meditatory songs."
5,Daily meditatons for women,I was given this book 25 years ago. It is spot on every morning. I just gifted it to my best friend who needed inspiration badly. My now 29 year old daughter gained so much from it as well - she began reading it each morning as a teenager.
3,I like the Hazelden series of meditation books,"The daily comments are a little shorter than I like, but I do appreciate the quotes from women at the end of each page."
3,Power DVD Cyberlink,"The DVD is only for 2 Channel setup. So you don't get all of the sound out of your speakers. Will not use the product. I use the free and popular software to view videos and play music,now. No need to purchase this kind of software to view movies on DVD."
1,Fire Hazard!,"This is the worst toaster oven known to man. Who knew that it was so difficult to design a toaster oven that,unlike this one, can toast evenly, has a grill feature whose grill spacing won't permit food to fall through and catch fire, can ding when food is ready, etc., etc. Our last oven was so perfect (Krups) it made oven design look easy. So, this time I tried to save a few bucks. Wrong decision."
1,Read all the reviews!,"The Toastmaster is VERY dangerous! Please read over all the reviews! I honestly don't know how this thing is still for sale. It burns things so quickly that its easy to accidentally start a fire. The one I had didn't explode, but I only used it a few times! This appliance is dangerous and I do NOT recommend buying it at all! I destroyed mine, then threw it away. Do not buy this product!"
1,Action? Uh. Where?,"If you've played the video games, killing everything in sight, then you know that the levels pretty much stay empty.And that's about where this series takes off. Nothing happens. Seriously. Nothing.Oh, there's atmosphere--about as much as looking at the nice art CAN give. Stuff is happening SOMEwhere, but not on camera. To perfectly sum up what goes on, our hero is traveling with a totally clueless girl blathering on about nothing; a tiny monster appears out of nowhere and the hero kills it; the girl does not notice.Completely forgettable and a chore to watch, especially if you have any kind of expectations for action--ACTION? Did SOMEone say action?They must be playing the video games because this is a snore. ZZzzzzzzzzZzzzzZZZZzZz"
3,"Nice case, but doesnt fit digital I-Zone","This is a very nice quality camera bag for the I-Zone Polaroid cameras, but it will not fit the digital/polaroid combo. The price is excellent, the quality superb, but I will probably break even by sending it back and paying shipping costs."
4,Full of v interesting ideas.,"In terms of interesting ideas, this book is one of the best in SF I have read. If you are even vaguely interested in language theory, you will like the interesting twists the author gives to the ideas in that field. In terms of developing these ideas to their full potential, the book is not so good. It makes a v fine start but leaves you a little dissatisfied in the end. If you like SF for ideas, this is a good choice. But if you are looking for characterization or action, there are lots of other far better ones."
1,Poor science and poor fiction means poor science fiction.,"I haven't quite read every book, but this could possibly be the worst book ever written. The story focuses on linguistic theories about embedded language. The problem is that if you don't have a background in linguistics (universal grammar, embedding, recursiveness) then you will have trouble understanding it. Either way, the book is horrible. The characters are shallow, the action is forced, and the plot is unbelievable. At some points the writing is so bad I had to put the book down. It's a nice effort, but it just can't hold the reader for more than 2 or 3 pages."
1,Better material available,"I am returning this book for several reasons. For one, there are questions about pharmacology and medical calculations that have nothing to do with pharmacy law. Secondly, it has the appearance of being copyrighted in the 60's (electric typewriter font). Third, it's only test questions.I recommend the book Guide to Federal Pharmacy Law, by Barry Reiss. You'll get your test questions but also reference materials to actually read and study."
4,I passed,"I found some discrepancies in the book, and that worried me of the accuracy of the book. I passed my test with an 85. I know it helped me prepare my mind for the type of questions asked. Especially since I hadn't taken a test in over 10 years."
2,Not Exactly Freakonomics,"Maybe I've been spoiled after reading Freakonomics, which was so clever and unique it was hard to put down, but I found this book to be pretty dull in comparison. Most of the examples were just not that interesting or unique topics to read about, such as gambling odds, political polls, crime statistics and a rehash of the Monte Hall problem from Parade magazine, which was widely written about years ago."
3,Not so easy to clean waffles,"This waffle iron makes pretty decent waffles. They don't take anytime to cook. If your stomach is growling and you want a waffle you can go ahead and make one. They pop out of the non- stick iron easily. The downside to this ""easy clean"" iron is that you have to wipe it off while it is still warm or you'll be scraping batter off for weeks. So remember to wipe it clean before you chow down on your waffles."
4,Solid,"Fatelessness is the story of a fourteen year old boy who survives concentration camps during the Holocaust. While there were a few issues, it is a solid book that those who are interested in this time in history of the survivor genre.4 Stars:- Interesting perspective- the naivete of the narrator was captured well.- The ending message was really the pivotal point in the novel. I don't want to give it away, but it really made the novel for me.Minus 1 Star:- It took me quite a long time to get in to this book- somewhere around 5 pages.- I sometimes questioned the quality of the translation."
4,Works as Advertised,Extremely easy to use and is very handy if you have several hard drives around and do not wish to mount them in cases.
1,Quality is poor,It is not expensive but then you will soon realize the blue plastic pops off and leaves a bare circuit board in its place.
3,bathroom book,"Yeah I think this serves the best as a bathroom book. A lot of the cliches are really obvious, such as the invisible wall rule where the hero doesn't die--who doesn't know that alreaday? Also the Surviving Thumb himself submitted quite a few entries, and as much as I love that guy (he's my hero, right next to Jesus) they're just not very funny. I really wish he was more ruthless as he was in his reviews. Props to David Stevens from Texas, who submitted at least a dozen entries concerning movie nudity-related cliches in this book. David, you the man. The man."
2,Not really worth the price,"Granted, some of the ideas are funny, but most of the book is a waste.Only around a third of the entries cite more than one example. Some don't cite any. I would like to know where these particular cliches are found, especially if I don't recognize them.I felt as if the publishers were trying to fill up space. The font is rather large, and there is quite a bit of space between entries. Plus, some strange, irrelevant pictures scattered here and there. And (in more than a few cases), the EXACT SAME IDEA is repeated under different titles.It's almost as if the publishers downloaded their text from the Internet, didn't bother to edit for content, then slapped Roger Ebert's name on the cover. The whole thing has a very unprofessional feel to it.It reminded me very much of those glossy #3.50-type books one finds in supermarkets."
2,Not the Cal I Knew,"I met Cal before he became a porn star, and I remained an acquaintance until his death. Yes, I shared some sexcapafes with him in the early years; but mainly he was an occasional friend who came to dinner every so often. He was an able,intelligent,educated man who never achieved his goal of being a legitimate theatre star. For example, I had no hesitation about using him as an invited guest speaker at some of my university courses. I was also always a little saddened about how he let people use him. I know he tried to create an aura for the public but I would have expected a perceptive author to uncover more of the real man. This simply is not the Cal I knew."
1,Recorded DVDs won't play on other DVD players :-P,"I tried four separate recordings to the Samsung-specified DVD-R media, and each yielded the same result: the DVD plays fine ont he Samsung unit, but will not play properly on any other player if you try to fast forward, skip chapters, etc. The playback skips frames and the audio drops out entirely.I tried to play my Samsung-recorded DVDs on a 5-year-old Panasonic player, a 1-year-old Toshiba player, and my 2-year-old Mac G4 laptop. Same problem each time.I made several calls to Samsung tech support, but they were dumbfounded, and only suggested I replace the unit. I did. The replacement unit had the same trouble."
3,Out For Justice,"What would you do if you went through all the legal channels to bring the bad guys to justice, but justice turns its back on you? What could you do if you sought closure for your brother's death, but everywhere you turned led to a dead end? Sonny Deol brings life to a man, dishonorably discharged from the military, who desperately seeks for answers to the questionable allegations of his brother's mysterious demise. Not only does he have to face the local law enforcements, but he also has to face working with the woman to whom he professed his love but was sourly rejected. This film unravels from one twist to another."
4,Works well enough,I got these bags to hold carbon and other filtration media in my canister filter on my aquarium. This bags works effectively. The only complaint I may have is that a significant amount of the fine grit from some carbon media still gets through the bag. For what it is though the bag works effectively. The string ties are easy to close and are able to pull together completely to keep the media in. The price was good.
4,Great Portable Speakers,"These speakers have a couple of things that really make them great. First is the A/C adaptor so when you when power is available, you are not draining the batters. The other is pretty fair sound for something that is the size of rolled up umbrella. These are by far the best speakers I have found to travel around with."
1,Piece of junk,"Do not waste your money. Cheap, poorly made, and impossible to work. (The manual is no hope as the directions do not work.)"
3,"amusing, but not in the same league with Auntie Mame","_How Firm a Foundation_ is one of Patrick Dennis's lesser-known efforts. The title is a play on words, as the idealistic John Wesley Smith joins the Fennessey Foundation as its Director of Projects, only to find out that his real job is to tutor the children of millionaire Justin Fennessey and his diva wife Lydia and that the Foundation is merely a sham for tax purposes. When the IRS starts breathing down the Fennesseys' necks, though, John Wesley Smith is unwillingly involved in their desperate efforts to evade the tax man. It's amusing enough, but it lacks the truly memorable characters of Auntie Mame or The Joyous Season."
2,terrible,"this anakin is horrible. he is ok for a display piece or for poses but you cant even attempt to play with him. His right arm has a ""Force Magnet"" to hold his saber but it doesnt hold it very well at all.He also comes with a detachable right arm to recreate the scene from the movie when dooku cuts his arm off. So whenever you move his right arm it falls off! The only good thing about it is you get his two lightsabers. If you want an anakin you can actually play with i would reccomend ""Secret Ceremoney Anakin"""
4,It's a decent toy.,"This figure doesn't much look like Anakin in the movies, his blu lightsaber falls apart easily, and his arms swinging motion doesn't work very well. You can pull off his right forearm to reanact when Dooku cuts it off. I think this toy is the best Anakin figure, but not the best Star Wars figure."
5,The Greatest Thing even if the Loudest Ever:))),We've had this very egg head for 5 years and we adore it. Yes it does wake the dead and kinda glad to see that our old machine is still made with that same buzzer. Keep on making them the same. We only hard cook and on occasion softer cook eggs. Don't try to use the poach egged methods. Otherwise we adore it and make that I adore it. The only electric appliance I've ever wanted and My Mom and Mother In Law and Husband all covet everything else and sometimes they don't do as well as they are expected to but not this little egg head including it's most annoying buzzer in the world. You have to have a sense of humor here folks....I actually often stand over the cooker when it's close to it's 17 minute done time ready to pull the plug or push the off button. What a delight and yes wakeup call to your nervous system....go for it!
2,CAREFUL OF STEAM BURNS!!!,"I've used my new little Egg Head once and I have two steam burns, which are quite painful, and 2 poached eggs that were over cooked. My mom has an electric egg cooker that cooks the eggs much more acurately. I guess I'll have to fuss with the amount of water to perfect my egg production. My husband would also add that the buzzer that lets you know that the eggs are done is extraordinarily obnoxious. If you are looking for an egg cooker, my advice would be to keep looking...unless you are into pain!"
2,Nowhere near what I'd hoped for,"I bought this as a gift for my wife, since she likes eggs and they're not so quick to cook the ""old-fashioned"" way. We've used it a few times, and found it doesn't really live up to our expectations.The idea seems like a good one: the unit heats a small amount of water and uses the steam to cook eggs under a sealed lid. In theory that might make cooking faster and more efficient, but this may be marginally true (it takes 18 minutes to hard-boil 6 eggs). While the cooker does do its job, to my mind the alarm it uses is enough of a reason not to recommend it. It produces the worst ""all done"" noise I've ever heard from an appliance -- a very loud alarm buzzer that sounds like it should be in a fire alarm. I wish it could have been designed to simply turn itself off when it was done."
4,Easy hard-boiled eggs,"Easy,convenient way to make perfect hard-boiled eggs. Loud buzzer sounds so I know when they're done from another room. Also makes omelettes."
2,15-Ounce Oval Dish,"Have to be careful when microwaving. Lid pops off and creates spills, if left sealed. If not liquids still seap out over the edge and spill."
2,Not as powerful,I am disappointed with this one. The dryer is not powerful at all and if anything it think it makes my hair flatter when I want to make volume. Not sure why but I ended up getting different one. I got rid of box so I cant even return!
1,Works great - for a few months,"This ice crusher looks great and works great - for a few months. Mine quit after three months of very light use. The motor still runs, but it doesn't crush any ice. For a product this expensive, I expected a lot more. Also, given the ""professional"" tag, you'd expect it to be able to crush gallons of ice daily. I have crushed maybe a gallon in three months.Update: I took mine in for repair with the local service center. They determined it needs replacement. Four (!) months later, I still have not received my replacement. I finally got a call from Waring asking me if I would accept a refund since they don't know when the product will be back in stock. Not sure what the deal is - it's still on sale here at Amazon."
1,Severe jamming problems makes it almost useless.,"I have never managed to get this crusher to go through more than a gallon or so of ice without it jamming, at which point I have to wait for the ice to melt before I can use it again. What a waste of money."
4,Ice Crusher Excellence,"A terrific product: well-designed, top-notch performance, quieter than other ice crushers I have owned. So why not a five? I gave it a four because the crushed ice is just a bit larger that I had desired: wanted sno-cone type ice got...small hail sized bits. But I kept it and am happy with this product."
5,Waring ice cruser,"This is one of the greatest additions to our kitchen. Rugged, functional, easy to clean and makes great crushed ice - perfect."
2,If you want really small crushed ice...this is not the product for you...,We are in the process of packing it up and returning it as I write. It required two runs thru to get the ice crushed to my husband's preference. Then it started making some kind of squealing/squeaking noise... It's also a big large to just have hanging around your kitchen... :-)
2,Works When It Feels Like It,"I am on my second machine. When it works, it really works well. I used it to crush four trays of ice, once a day. The first one died after about three months for absolutely no reason at all. It just stopped working, period. So, I got another one that came in June '12 and this just makes a squealing noise and doesn't crush the ice. It's obviously not old and not overworked. When you label something as 'Professional"" it should be a heavy duty item. If a small piece of ice gets caught under the middle blade, it just gets hung up and won't do anything. This item is very poorly designed. By the way, It was sold by a third party through Amazon and neither one of them will not give me satisfaction because it is older than thirty days. I contacted Waring through their web site hoping they could help me, but that was about three days ago and I haven't heard anything. Great customer service, huh? Keep searching and find a better one."
3,Professional Stainless-Steel Ice Crusher,DOESN'T CRUSH AS SMALL AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD AND SOMETIMES THE ICE GETS STUCK IN THE MACHINE.
1,More than ice?,When crushed ice melts you get a fine white residue in the bottom of glass.Not a good image when you serve ice water.
3,Not for Professionals,Worked great and I really enjoyed it. I used it maybe 3 or 4 times a day. Not professionally. It lasted 10 days shy of 11 months before the motor literally threw a rod and quit.
1,Wish I would have listened to the bad reviews,This ice crusher is horrible. I read the bad reviews but chose not to listen to them. We we took it out of the box it would only crush two small ice cubes at one time and would still sometimes jam up. You had to stand there and feed them in one by one. Used this machine for two weeks and the blades will no longer turn when you put ice in. I know there are good reviews out there but I wish I had never bought this. It's an expensive peice of junk.
2,poor job on large size ice cubes,"I purchased this machine for my crushed-ice-eating wife thinking it would solve our problems. It looks nice, runs very quietly and makes the counter top look like a professional food prep area. It doesn't work on large ice cubes at all, the blades move too slowly to effectively trap and crush the cubes. Instead they dance around the plodding blade as it slowly rotates. I find the vintage ice-o-mat, vogue model, hand crank ice crusher to be much more effective. It requires moderate strength but never fails to finely chop the ice. We purchased it at a local antique/collectible store for $15. The Waring will be in the mail on Monday!T. NelsonMt. Bethel, Pa"
3,WHY WHY WHY DID YOU DID THIS POKEMON,LOOK ALL THE KIDS HOW PLAY THIS SAIDS IT IS A BAD GAME FOR THE DS. BUT I THINK THE GAME IS OK! NOT GOOD I PAST ONE DAY.
2,"Looks good, not practical","We bought this for my mother-in-law for the holidays, and it's a gorgeous case. Very soft feel to it, pretty color.That's the reason it got 2 stars.Otherwise it's very impractical -- as far as the Razr phone is concerned. When your phone rings, it's tough to get it out of the case in order to answer it in time.Perhaps the same material, but in a flip phone design would work better."
5,Great accessory that makes a bold statement,I absolutely love this case. I have gotten more compliments from this case alone. Not to mention the shocking looks from people that have never seen anything like this case. The only down fall is that the case doesn't have a clip to clip on your pance or purse. But the material of the Eel skin is so delicate that I perfer it in my purse to protect it from scratching. If you buy this case your make a great decision for a great buy.
4,Learning Curve is now TOMY...,"Apparently, Learning Curve is now TOMY and they've made some changes. Annie & Clarabel are now made with the same facial expressions, which my son is not to happy about. I considered returning them, but just decided to use a black sharpie to change Annie's mouth... :o My incredibly picky 3yo is now fine with it, so I'm happy too. But had I known this originally, I just would have bought used with the correct expressions!"
4,One more in the collection,"As with all Thomas the Train vehicles, Annie and Claribel are durable, can be dropped without breaking. This pair is the coach trains that are featured in the Thomas stories. My 3 year old recognized them right away"
3,Are they knockoffs? Annie has the same happy face as Clarabel!,"My picky 3.5 year old son wants Annie and Clarabel for a long time. He's been waiting for the package for days and he even asked our apartment doorman for it. However, the minute he opened the package, he noticed Annie has the same happy face as Clarabel. What a big disappointment for a big time Thomas fan! Are they authentic Learning Curve or Tomy toys? I should have read reviews about the warning before ordering. If your little ones are detail-oriented about their Thomas trains, DO NOT BUY THIS!!"
5,Love Annie and Clarabel!,"My 4 year old has been collecting Thomas wooden trains for years, and this was a great addition to his collection."
4,Thomas isn't complete without Annie And Clarabel.,My child loves the Annie and Clarabel cars for his Talking Thomas train. It completes Thomas and he re-enacts Thomas episodes with them. Great fun!
3,Poor Customer Service,"I've had this product for a couple weeks now, and plan to return it due excessive and consistent lag time (""not responding"" when making changes in the calendar). Perhaps its fixable, or user error, but I wouldn't know because their customer service hasn't responded to my two inquiries, despite the claim on their website to have very prompt support response time. Two inquiries prior to purchase regarding the educational discount were not replied to either."
2,A dissapointing album,"After an array of excellent albums Belinda came up with this, a dreary collection of songs that never quite pick up. The reason I gave this album two stars as an apose to one is mainly because of the tracks wrap my arms and big scary animal which, although try to rescue the album, only shine a little light at the end of a very long, very dark tunnle."
1,A REAL disappointment,"I am a big Belinda Carlisle fan, ever since her days with the Go-Go's. I loved her first 3 solo albums, ""Belinda"", ""Heaven on Earth"" and ""Runaway Horses"", but starting in 1990, Belinda seems to have lost it. ""Live you life be free"" was terribly weak compared to her previous solo efforts, and ""Real"" is worse. The only song I vaguely like is ""Big Scary Animal"", which resembles one of her classics, ""Leave a light on"". None of the other songs are any good, so it's one star for this very disappointing album."
3,My Story As Told By Water,"My Story As Told By Water by David James Duncan was a confusing and overly political way to express the author's love for water. HIs diliverey is good, but he should keep in mind that his readers are reading for entertainment, not to hear about our government's poor decisions."
3,"Nicely done, but with some issues","I made several nice pours using Guiness and a variety of ""tans"" including cider; however, it really did not like it when I used something like a Sam Adams dark beer. It mixed as if the turtle did not exist.As long as you stick with those beers on their packaging, it is a great little contraption!"
1,Misleading,"I ordered a blue Silicone Skin Case for the Wii remote and nunchuck but recieved a black one. Needless to say my daughter was disappointed because she wanted the blue one. After 4 emails with no help or resolution to the issue I gave up and kept the black covers. This seller has very poor customer service skills, and they misrepresented their product. I would have been satisfied with some type of response!!!! Buyer Beware!!!!"
1,"Great book, terrible edition (General Books LLC 2009)","This is an excellent story as related by other reviewers. However, I recommend against buying the General Books LLC (August 5, 2009) edition of Burnaby's classic. The production value is extremely low. There are numerous typos on each page which makes reading difficult to enjoy. This is also not a page-for-page reprint, so page breaks occur mid-page. This also makes reading this book much less enjoyable. Please do read Burnaby's ""A Ride to Khiva"", but to not waste your money on the General Books LLC edition."
5,nice for the collector,this was a nice surprise.My teenager loved it .Came in a nice case with both movies.Movies are wonderful to watch.
2,I've only read through the 68th page but...,"I don't understand!! I am reading the spanish version and the footnotes are IN PORTUGUESE?? I don't see why they couldn't translate those! I mean, footnotes are supposed to be there to HELP you understand the book! I have to turn in an 8 page summary of this book and I don't understand it!This isn't a book for someone who doesn't know the history of Europe; it has NOT been written for the general public! It's a very interesting subject matter but It's not clearly explained (at least not in my opinion). It goes through so many examples that one forgets what the author was talking about in the first place. I don't like it! *sighs*( It's good to be able to vent) (by the way, if anyone can help me understand it, I have to turn in my paper on Wed!) hehe! Thanks!"
5,Cheap and worth it.,I bought this a year ago and love it. It's easy to make sandwiches and they taste good. I also tend to make pancakes in it too as well as quesadillas.
1,Awful,"This CD is probably my worst purchase yet. For starters, the backround vocalists can sing much better then the lead singer, who sounds like he has a golf ball stuck down his throat. Bad re-recordings of hit songs"
1,"Fake ""Drifters""",All songs on this CD are rerecorded and sound nothing like the originals. I was able to tell within the first couple of seconds of the first song that something was not right. Avoid.
2,There Are Better Standup DVD Out There!,"Save your money!! The only standouts on this DVD are Alex Thomas and Rodney Perry; but most of their material was done in previous performances. I recommend that you catch Alex in his Platinum Comedy Series: Alex Thomas - Straight Clownin'. Rodney had me cracking up but his performance was better in Cedric The Entertainer's, Starting Line Up 2. I almost busted a gut. Your money will be well spent on that DVD!"
4,Great Rare Munsters,"This is actually a great release. I bought this to supplement my Season One, Season Two, and Munster movies collection. A lot of the material here is repeated on the Munsters Season special features, but it still has additional unreleased material that is needed for any completist. The casual fan can pass on this package, but to any Munstermaniac, this is a must have!"
3,"Nice Webcreator,.. but uploader??","I think that NetObject did a great job in making a program that's easy handling, and very very good to make a nice website and to learn more and more from the program untill your a skilled webmaker. But there is one major problem i have with Netobject Fusion 4.0; i finally made a very nice site; and i desperatly want to get in on the net (for example a project for school)and i have a free webspaceprovider like geocities; fill in the user ID and my password (in the Publish Area) as remote host i fill in ftp.geocities.com; so everything must be correctly filled in; so i expect it to work but of cours it doesn't and that is why i'm disapointed in NetobjectsFusion Greetings from a also disapointed Dutch Boy !!!!"
4,use this book to bring out other's better side=more satisfying life,"Since writing this book I've continued to receive emails from people around the world, and used my dialogue with those people to launch my Say it Better ezine and to go on and write Resolving Conflict Sooner, Beauty Inside Out and an e-book, LikeABILITY: How to be Happier & Higher Performing With Others that has sold widly...If you want an approach you can put into practice very day to get along better with people you just met, love or, well hate, this book rmains a classic primer (for me and I wrote it). Stop letting somebody else determine your behavior. Discover the power of going slow to go fast. Look to their positive intent, especially when they appear to have none. Send me an email (www.sayitbetter.com) and tell me what you found most helpful about this book and I'd be delighted to send you an e-book, Make Yourself Memorable (sold 20,000) just for sharing your insight with me"
1,Breadman Lemon,The breadman plus is probably the worst item I have ever bought on E-Bay. We had nothing but problems with it since day one and when we wrote and asked for help we were told it was the end of the line type item and we could not get replacement parts for it. A real Lemon.
5,Better some of the others,"I tried one of the other test movies and it was far, far too jittery for me to watch. Now that I know what's going on, this one wasn't bad. If the goal is to determine ""would this make a good feature film"" I'd say most definitely."
4,First Test Movie,"I was very surprised at how good this was. I only watched first 30 minutes.. didn't want to watch the whole thing with hopes it would be a movie some day ;)The plot was an interesting one. Yes done before, but still different enough to be a movie i would watch. Performances and the right music/sound could be really compliment the plot and be a good movie."
3,Interesting Concept,"I hadn't heard of these little movies until today, but I must say I found the premise interesting enough to watch the whole video. Sure the graphics are draft quality, but the screenplay works and as a live action or well done graphic movie, I'd pay to see it next time. Keep up the good work Amazon, innovation doesn't just happen, you have to work at it."
2,Contrived and derivative,"I like the format and animations for these Amazon test movies, but this script was pretty badly done. This is basically a mash up of the x-men and a psycho-drama serial killer movie. Considering the experimental nature of the Amazon studios project I would expect more daring plots and storytelling."
1,testing...,"my opinion of this trial movie has been requested...i provide it here, and gratis (amazon, be grateful)...no one this side of a death wish would even consider translating this abomination into a feature...ciao."
3,wrong version - but it looks fun,the version I received does not work with windows 7. I presume this is my fault so I'm not complaining. will probably try to find a correct version later. - the price was excellent.
4,2 martini Bowling,"Crazy way to pass the time, a sport I once enjoyed. Really shows up my split problem! Can't wait for my best friend to get to town and play doubles!!"
4,Fun,"recived this game in the time stated,only problem I have is the IWIN keeps popping up,But the game it self is a lot of fun, both my husband and myself play it when ever we have any spare time."
4,"if going to Tokyo, buy this book",I bought this book before going to Tokyo and found it an excellent resource of things to do without spending a cent. It is a must!
4,No Posers!,"This is a good CD from a Chicago local metal band in the mid-90's. Nicely produced with great guitar work, steady solid drumming, and overall good heavy riffs. In the vain of Pantera, Fight, Skid Row (the heavy stuff). Vocals are a little rough but unique. Not one ballad on it!"
1,quality has gone downhill,"In the past, the DKNY tights I've purchased would last forever. However, the pair I purchased from Amazon got runs in them almost immediately. I was very disappointed - and I guess I will switch to another brand."
2,If you like pale toast . . .,"I've not been pleased with this toaster. I usually have to send the bread through again, even at the darkest setting, before it looks remotely toasted."
2,We may need a revolution but this ain't it.,"After Esthero's 1998 ""Breath From Another,"" I've been wondering for 7 years when she would be back. I'm so disappointed. As much as I love Esthero's voice, I wonder if it was Doc I liked so much considering my favorite tracks from this album were produced with him.Breath From Another had a certain depth I can't find on the new album - slightly cryptic lyrics that told an interesting story open to interpretation. The new album sounds like the same self-promotional crap I hear from everyone else these days. ""I'm the baddest bitch to ever hit this town""? Please.I understand artists evolve and change - but I can't get into this one."
5,Esthero is BACK!,"I was delighted to hear the NEW Esthero album! I was wondering if the amazing duet, 'HOW COULD I?' with John Forte's on his 'i, John' album was the last I was going to hear from this wonderful voice!(...)'Breath from Another' introduced a sexy, sultry voice to music... I am glad she is following in John Forte's footsteps in that she is singing about 'the flaws of the music industry' and all it's current negativity with a GROOVE.It IS time for a change!Thanks Esthero!"
4,Love her,"one of my favorites. Always love her. definite a pioneer way before Adele, Duffy, or Amy Winehouse. Unique, catchy sound."
4,Disappointing,"It's not as good as her first, plain and simple... She needs to go back to her trip-hop roots like in ""Breath from Another"". This album sounds to much like the music she's singing against, you know pop music. All in all the album is better than a lot of stuff out there but you can't beat ""Breath from Another""."
2,not a borderlless photo paper,"It is usable, but it is not a Borderless Photo paper Plus. Something is wrong with the number (7980A022). If You order this Photo Paper, it will come as a Regular Canon Photo Paper Plus, Glossy, but not Borderless."
1,Didn't work well for me.,"Bought it brand new. Tried 2 of their recipes, one Krusteaz bread machine mix, two of my own recipes. None turned out right. This was my 4th bread machine, wore out the previous 3, so have lots of experience with bread machines, this one was the worst I ever had. Contacted the company, didn't get much help, just kept saying do a dough ball test, I explained that I had never had to do one before, in years and years of using bread machines. Just too much trouble...so, got myself a Zojirushi, even though lots more money it works like a champ...first time, every time, right out of the box!"
1,disappointment,The first one I ordered was shipped upside down and was broken upon receipt. They sent another one in record time however I am very unhappy with it's performance. I put my ingredients in and turned it on for a rapid bake. When there was ten minutes left in the bake cycle the kneading started again! There went my loaf!!! I was going to try again but I couldn't even get the kneading to turn off unless I unplugged the machine! I will go back to walmart and buy a cheap one. The bread was a little darker than I liked but at least the machine worked! I would give this a big fat zero if that was one of my choices!
2,Dead after 20 loaves,"What a lot of fun - until it broke. I used it a lot in the first year, put it on the shelf for a year, then took it out tonight. The motor crapped out, and it was out of warranty. I seriously used it like a couple dozen times - a motor shouldn't die in that time. Customer service was apologetic but resolute. All bread makers are easy to use - the two moving parts shouldn't die in that amount of time."
3,Consistent but not great bread,"I bought one of these a few years ago based on its choice by Consumer Reports as the top bread machine. I struggled mightily with it for two years, trying every different recipe I could. Here's the bottom line--it consistently made OK bread that wasn't burnt or raw, but it just comes nowhere close to homemade bread.The texture I get when I hand-knead bread is chewy, slightly moist, with air holes. The texture I get with the bread machine is very fine-grained, unchewy, and dry, just like supermarket bread.This may be true for all bread machines, but I somehow think it's just this model because other people rave about the bread they get from their bread machines.I finally gave up and put the machine out in the garage.If you like a very commercial-style bread, this may be OK for you. Be warned that it's very noisy. I tried using the timer to make bread at night for morning use, but even in a large house it is still way too noisy to sleep through."
2,Same quality problems that others have experienced,"I bought the Breadman to replace my old Rival bread machine that lasted almost 8 years. The Breadman made excellent bread when it worked. It mixed the dough well and baked the bread thoroughly. However, the spindle that turns the paddle stopped spinning. It appears that this is a common problem with this machine.Pro's: Good mixing (when the paddle spins) and baking, many baking options to choose from, battery backup, great recipies included.Con's: Motor is underpowered. The machine would get stuck from time to time when making a 2 pound loaf and I would have to manually push the paddle to get it moving again. Eventually it appears to have stripped out a gear and stopped working entirely.After reading other reviews about similar quality problems, I decided to return the machine for a refund."
1,made nice bread.... ONCE,"I got this product as a gift. It made a nice loaf of bread the first time I ran it, but the second time I used it, the paddle would not turn. It turns out the belt came off the shaft, so I put the belt back on to give it a second try. No dice - same problem. I will be returning it shortly. Buyer beware!!! Quality issues have definitely arisen w/ this product!"
2,Great Bread - But machine must be watched,"I have only one problem with this machine, but it is critical. The mixer always falls out of the machine during kneading. I need to pause the machine reinsert the mixer piece and restart - sometimes several times during a bread cycle.As many other reviews say, the bread is great, it's easy to clean, and I am lucky to have the pause option so I can do this."
3,bottoms up!,"This machine makes consistently great bread. However, we have had so many problems with the belt coming off, that we have removed the bottom for easy access to the belt. Before that, it was bottoms up! It must be a design flaw, but I am sick of it. I don't trust using the delay timer, because I can't trust the belt. It has been this way since the second loaf."
4,bread all the time,"I bake different kinds of bread from banana bread to corn bread in this breadmaker. It is easy to use, easy to clean. My only peeve with this product is that you can never get a perfect looking loaf as the mixing blade gets embedded into the bread at the bottom making a little dent in the loaf."
1,poor,first time i got this out of the box it made bread stick style so don't buy this item unless you like stick style bread.
1,Could have burned my house down,"I bought this machine based on the reviews of others. The first time I used it, smoke came billowing out within minutes of the bake cycle beginning. I thought maybe something had spilled out and was burning on the inside. I removed the bread pan and everything was clean. I started the bake cycle back up and again smoke. It smelled electrical, so I immediately unplugged it. I am so grateful that I was home and hadn't set it to bake while I was out. I called the manufacturer and they were very helpful and apologetic and sent a return label for it. I returned it to them about 3 weeks ago, and have heard nothing yet."
1,Worst purchase I ever made...period.,"I just scraped the dough out of my third unit (brand new unit, first loaf of bread). The paddle stopped turning during the second kneading cycle. The first unit made it though one loaf of bread before the paddle stopped turning. The second unit didn't even work out of the box (same problem--paddle would not turn). Likely, a persistent problem with the belt coming off the shaft. Unable to get through to manufacturer. So long, Salton. You'll never get my business again. I couldn't be more disappointed."
2,The revised NIST Handbook is now available,"I looked at this book at a bookstore, and the sheer size, as well as the tiny print, was discouraging. I'm glad I didn't buy it. The revised edition, the NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions, by Frank Olver et al., was published in May 2010 and is available in hardcover (Amazon price $79) or paperback (Amazon price $45). No customer reviews yet, and no Amazon Preview, but one editorial review says the book has large type (good!) and a lot of graphics, mostly in color. So I ordered the new book."
1,Wasnt what it was displayed as,I ordered this bag thinking that 2 pair of sticks came with it but when I recieved it I was truly disappointed. I mainly needed the sticks because my son is in marching band but I didnt want to waste the time of sending the bag back
5,Bruce Bruce,We saw this show on cable first and had to own it.this video is lol funny. We totally enjoyed it.
1,Not recommended if you need factual information,"I found the information provided in this book to be inaccurate at times, putting the accuracy of ALL the information to question. In addition, it seemed to be a compilation of information/statements not arranged in any logical or meaningful fashion.I was very disappointed."
3,"Decent Item, But beware shipping cost","Ive bought this head wrap before and i liked it for the price. Back then i was in the military and didn't care about shipping costs etc and i wasn't in a hurry so i just took standard shipping. I ordered again recently, for Halloween, having torn up my old one and was shocked by the shipping cost. Typically when i use 2 day shipping i see maybe 20$ or so for a fragile item or large item but the 2-day shipping on this one is insane. this item is neither large, fragile, or heavy, but had to cancel my order due to the shipping cost. There is no way I'm spending 50$ on 2 day shipping for a small piece of cloth that fits in an envelope. So just a warning to everyone buying this item, it's a good item for the price just don't pay for faster shipping they'll rip you off on that one."
3,great old school music,"Bobby Womacks Thats The Way I Feel About Ya and the Cornelius Brothers and Sister Rose with Billie Jo, Too Late to Turn Back Now are two of my favorite all time releases. Both of these songs have stood the test of time."
1,Didn't quite understand the problem...,"The company I purchased from, Osprey-Talon, was great about helping me deal with this defective product. I have an HP Pavilion dv9000 laptop, and I purchased this to charge it. However, the first one never worked at all. I assumed it was defective, and since I still had my old adapter (but it was partially chewed through by my adorable puppy, hence the need for a new one), saw that it was a problem with the new adapter. I sent in for a replacement, which I received. It never quite felt like it fit in snugly or correctly with my laptop's connection, and it would only give a charge when wiggled and adjusted in a very specific position. So I got a refund and bought one through Best Buy. That one works flawlessly to this day. There was just something weird with this one..."
3,Functionality is nice but fit is so-so,As a cover for the delicate and pricey color screen on a Jornada 525 it is fabulous. The holder for the spare stylus is a great idea and actually adds structural rigidty to the cover when the stylus is stored. My problem with this cover is that it doesn't flip up and lock nicely into place. The hinges spread apart and want to force the cover closed. Variety of colors is a nice idea with everyone wanting to express themselves these days and the colors are not repulsive. Overall I think HP could have designed it better but it works OK.
4,Technical Writer for the game says.....,I was in college with the inventor of this game (David Whalen) and learned a lot about recing from working on the rule book with Dave. Its a GREAT game! Dave added a lot of features to revv up the engines of other racing fans! Plays like the real thing!!
4,6th Sense?,"I found the book to be well researched with over 90 pages of notes, indexes, and bibliography to support the 162 pages of the author's perspective and one possibility of how all life is interconnected. Myth or truth? Not easily answered because I don't think one could ever know now that most every inch of the planet has been explored and the primitive cultures ""found"" have been affected in too many ways. What impressed upon me most was that there is something profound that we can learn from studying and understanding these ancient ways. An interesting read."
4,Do You Wish to Open Your Mind?,"It really doesn't matter whether what Narby concludes is total nonsene or not. Some of the scientific reasoning is pretty weak. The microbiological evidence remains thin. Nevertheless. What matters is that Narby develops a view of the world that's outside the envelope. He invites readers to suspend belief in the version of reality that they have grown up in and to open their minds to one of a million of other ways of looking at the world. I believe that if you want to feel that little ""snap"" in your mind that signifies opening to a new way of seeing; if for just a moment you want to allow yourself to feel less secure on the foundation of scientific ""truth"" that has become the standard for describing the world we experience; then this book could be worthwhile reading for you. It sure was for me."
3,Promising but Fixated,"Writing style aside (it was translated from french), Narby presented some interesting hypotheses and viewpoints on the the scientific aspects of shamanism. As a biochemist-in-training I was especially interested in his interpretations of the various prints shown in his book. There is a serious flaw in his interpretations of what the forms of the double serpent represent, namely, the double helix (although this IS one of the representations.) Narby's fixation with only the DNA aspect of the double serpent eliminates key insights into how the shamans were able to ""see"" healing properties of plants.In spite of this flaw I recommend the book; it will arouse your curiosity in the world around you!"
4,good for the price,"This is my 4th coffee pot in 8 years. I love the melitta though. Yes it's not fancy, but that's what I like. No expensive features to break. No light bulbs to burn out. No clocks to reset. Only good,hot,delicious coffee. One negative thing is not all the water drains from the filter holder, so make sure to rinse after each pot of coffee is made. That's something I can live with."
3,Not much contents worth the price,"Frankly speaking, one of the reasons to buy so-called 'official guidebook' of a game is to read something not written or introduced elsewhere(i.e. some hidden stories, etc).Although this book is easy to understand, basically 95% of its contents are information you can get from online game websites; the only 'looks-unique' information was background stories of enemy ace pilots. The only advantage may be some color photographs of game screen, but I wonder how much the photo can compensate the slipshodness of contents."
5,HOOAH!,"FINALLY. a one on one.. full on, no holds bared dog fight.. witha werthy oppnent.. i love ALL the ace combat games. and aced all of them. including the new psp version. but i loved the last battle. hope for a new one for the PS3.. and as the now late tomcatters of the USN say... ""anyime baby!"""
1,Don't waste your money,"[...]This is no exaggeration - mine broke on the very first twig I tried to prune with it. It is cheaply made, does not work well when new, and will certainly not last."
5,Are You Stuck In A Lightsaber Fight?,"Repitition to the point of hipnotic. Growing (who have the best name ever), are here to save the day, making the most insane atmospheres (opposite Wolf Eyes) and really challenge the listner as well as reward them. It's two guys just throwing sounds up in the sky to see how they fall, and a lush blanket of loops playing a fierce tennis match. The music is much like the cover art; a beautiful nintendo background graphic and piles of either 'broken polygons' or 'broken glass fragments"". Smash your fist through this CD (much like I did at Best-Buy earlier) and tell Alex I said hello.Growing is great,,,,,,,makes your ears feel like they're growwwwwing."
4,A Snapshot in Time,"The opening, haunting theme composed and played by the great harmonicist, Larry Adler, sets the grim tone for this British film. Grim, but alleviated throughout by sensitive, good-will performances by Max Bygraves and Barbara Murray. The story is based on a book by the social worker, Elizabeth Coxhead, and reflects the concern of 1950s Britain for those children without families, condemned to orphanages. Lewis Gilbert directs the children effectively, though there's some evident camera shyness. I'd give this five stars but for the print, which is fair to middling. The story though, for those who have that period of time in the blood, is evocative of the era, one not quite so scruffy as it appears on the screen. This production is now available on DVD."
4,Another Excellent Release,"No sense in breaking this down song by song. If you liked In Asentia, then you should own this CD. If you like any of the band's previous two albums, then you should own this CD. Wilson just doesn't know how to make a bad album.As with any PT album, you need to give this one a few spins too. But not to worry, this one has immediate appeal. Still has all the qualities of a great PT album (soaring vocal harmonies, keyboard flourishes, hard and soft passages, crunching guitar)plus the great writing is still intact. One wonders if Wilson's side projects will ever dillute his PT work...so far it hasn't. Recommended."
4,Impressive!,"This is good stuff, a solid improvement on Stupid Dream and Signify (two very good albums in their own right). There's a lot of thematic stuff going on, and it's darker but not overly so. Porcupine Tree seems to be drifting away from catchier stuff into exploring themes that flow and ebb, building through songs, and I like it. I like it a lot."
5,Like trying to describe a Salvador Dali Painting.,"Truly a Masterpiece - There are no words I can describe for this - No matter what sytle of music you like I think you will appreciate this album... Very talented musicianship... and quite possibly the best rock band to emerge since the 70's.BEST TRACKS: Arriving Somewhere But Not Here / Open Car / LazarusIF YOU LIKED, AGREED, OR APPRECIATED THIS PLEASE CLICK YES FOR:""Was this review helpful?"""
2,This aint prog...,"I bought this cd because every time i came here to Amazon.com and looked at shredding, prog-rock/metal i would get a Porcupine Tree recommendation. Well, prog-heads, this isnt prog. Far from it.There are very few guitar solos, not much riffing (there is a bit, tho) songs sound like angst-radio oriented hard rock, almost nu-metal, but not metal. No prog here, some slightly off/wierd bits to be sure, but that doesnt make it prog. To be fair, the album is well produced, musicianship is good though there is no shredding. I didnt care for the lame songwriting, could almost pass for Staind or some such lousy band, just somewhat different.Fans of shredding bands like Dream Theater, Symphony X, Spiral Architect, etc should stay away from crap like this."
2,"Wow, maybe I shouldn't buy albums on an impulse","This was the worst peace of plastic i have ever bought. The first time I listened to it , I only heard the first track...which at the time sounded promising. Now that i had to erase it off my computer (every time it came on i was wondering, ""what is this crap"") I feel robbed. Makes me almost wish I downloaded music as opposed to buying it.It's pretty sad when I have such an appreciation for music and this can't find a place to in my collection. Please carefully consider reviews before you support this group. It seems like this band has some fairly good support @ amazon, maybe I am just too old that i still enjoy for depth and musicianship in my music."
5,Porcupine tree,"I have been introduced to Porcupine tree by my friend. When i first time heard thir music, i was shocked...WOW!!! So i decided actually to get to it more deep. more i listened them more I was fallung for them.I wonder only why such mediocre bands like Mudvaine, or Godsmack are on the top popularity list. What is popularity list? Oh...well who listen to them mostly teens.If you want to enjoy intelligent music try Buy this CD. you won't regret."
5,Best album of 2005.,"PORCUPINE TREE has never failed to fully satisfy the pickiest rock listener, and DEADWING surpases even the highest of expectations. Easily the best CD of 2005, this one rocks with great authority and purpose. STEVEN WILSON proves yet again that his musical instincts are dead on. The guy oozes talent. He and his equallly talented bandmates have made a record rife with great riffs, melodic hooks, and long interludes of sonic splendor. The song ARRIVING SOMEWHERE BUT NOT HERE is an absolute epic that induces breathlessness. Every track on the record bristles with a ferocious, desperate electric current that shakes the spine. PORCUPINE TREE is simply the best rock band you've never heard of, and if you haven't, you're really missing out. Awesome disc."
1,Terrible bread machine,The first one worked fine for 2 months then the belt started to slip and the machine made a terrible noise so we returned it. This took a month for the machine to go and come back. A brand new one returned and we have the same problem as before on the first loaf...the customer service was pretty good about both and they are sending another but it seems to be a common problem judging by some of the comments here so i would not recommend this machine
1,A waste of time and money,"I made about a half dozen loaves of bread with this machine with OK results in terms of taste. However, removing the paddle pretty much destroyed the integrity of the loaf every time. After that, the loaf pan lost it's nonstick coating completely and the bread came out in chunks. I have just wasted an hour looking for a site where I could purchase a replacement and have hit a brick wall. I agree that their support is terrible. I have been using my Cuisinart table top mixer to mix and knead bread with better results, although I loved the idea of set it and forget it with a bread machine. I would recommend staying clear of Breadman machines for sure."
1,Fresh Out Of New Ideas,"I realized this book was in trouble early on when I read the obligatory autopsy scene, a staple now it seems to all new writers of medical/science thrillers. This one even has two journalists donning surgical gloves to help the campy coroner with his dissection! Unbelievable. From here, the plot keeps slipping until the laughable climax -- young people running amuck like some game trying to outwit the befuddled mad doctors. No danger, no thrills. Just pure pulp."
3,A good start that peters out.,"I fully agree with those reviewers who were excited by the start of this book and then became discouraged about half way through. The author does not keep up either the suspense or the pace of the story. I also found the relationship between the three main characters to evolve rather strangely throughout the book, especially towards the end. In sum, a good idea for a thriller that doesn't quite thrill. Definitely not a page turner."
2,Cheap,This product does the job of hanging up the few stuffed animals my baby has but the material is extremely cheap. It is made of the same fabric that you would see in those mesh clothes hampers. It should be half the cost. It comes with three sets of picture hanging hooks and nails to support the three corners of the net. The net doesn't stay in the hooks because they are open so I had to hammer the hooks closed around the ring at the corner of the net.
3,Bit Overpriced For What It Is,"Cute net, but is a bit cheaply made. It felt like it was going to break after putting about six stuffed animals into it. Other than that, it was easy to hang up."
2,it no playtex !!!!,i bought these bottles for my 1 1/2 month old daughter and did not like them. first of all you can't fill the bottle beyond 8 oz. or they leak from the cap and the nipples are to soft daughter had a hard time sucking on them they kept popping out of here mouth! i like the ventaire or drop ins by playtex way better.
2,"Inferior ""Second"" quality item","The perches made by BOODA are always well made, this did not seem to be a manufacturing defect. The item sent was frayed along the edges of the rope near where the four sections ""cross"". I did not see the fray until 2 weeks after delivery when I fully extended the sections and began manipulating it to install in my parrot's cage. Had I better inspected it upon arrival, I would have returned it immediately, but of course would still be out the cost of shipping. This vendor apparently deals in ""second quality new"" merchandise and I will not shop with them again."
5,Recommended,"Great read, especially for the flying family! I thought Greg Brown a little bit sentimental/corny from reading his columns--but this book comes together nicely and proves that his sentimentality is genuine! Really brings out both his love of flying and family. Recommended."
2,Dribble pot,"This coffeemaker makes a great cup of coffee, and looks very stylish- BUT- the pot dribble everytime you pour. If you buy one, keep it next to the sink and a supply of paper towels!"
1,Boring!,Kristy wantedto be president but in the end she didn't want to be at all. Ann why like that?
3,"A slow starter, but worth the wait","I felt the book was slow in the beginning and took too long to develop the characters and story line. Once into it, the second half was very good and I enjoyed it."
4,Best for exotic juices!,"While I've never been an avid ""juicer,"" my Aunt Persi has always been a true believer in the health benefits of consuming copious amounts of fresh juices daily. In my bartending career, I tend to consume copious amounts of other types of beverages daily, so she bought me this machine for my birthday. I really enjoy using the juicer to create exotic juices to add to my mixed drinks. Much to my delight, the Juiceman excellently produces papaya, kiwi, starfruit, and even pomegranite juice! It also seems that, while the health benefits may be negated by mixing these tasty fresh juices with alcohol, the hangover effect is also negated. Thank you Juiceman!"
4,"We love it, even though....","I bought my Juiceman with great hesitation because of the price, but my boyfriend loves it so much I know it was worth it. The only problem we had was that the blade wore down in less than a month and a half. At least that is what we concluded after calling the customer service and telling them that the blade quit spinning when we tried to juice. They sent a new one for free and it is working fine again. I'm curious if it is normal for the blade to wear down so fast. We do juice a lot of carrots though, and that is one hard veggie."
1,problems,"this product is not good, it broke after a 20 uses, i need to return it ,please someone contact me in order for me to return this product.Nidya Hill"
2,"Produce great-tasting juices, but hard to clean.","My title says it all. I've owned this for a few years now. But I hardly use it anymore. It's powerful and it produces the best tasting and freshest juices (we just make them ourselves a moment ago, didn't we?), but it's only short-coming is the task of cleaning it. Tiny stuffs always get caught in the tiny holes in the grinder and it is not always easy to get them all out. It takes just a few moments to make the juices, a minute to finish the juices (they taste great), but a lot longer to clean up. If you don't mind spending ten to fifteen minutes each time you want fresh juice, this is a great kitchen equipment to own. It will keep you healthy, because the fresh juices are good for you and you'll have good exercise clean it up."
5,Double Dragon Power!,"So, being that I'm all into the sci-fi fantasy scene, this item was perfect for me. It looks good, all my friends love it, and the fact that it comes with it's own chain makes it even better!"
1,"Too short, too easy.","The game was way too short for it to be extremely fun. Other than the few things in it that were kind of amusing, there wasn't much in it that was worth it. The next problem is that it was too easy, and made for a quick game. It also tried WAY too hard to have a storyline, and therefore failed miserably. If you like to play the same game over and over, this game is for you."
1,Well...,I guess its ok. It has one bad scean in it. And part is gothic. Its a snooze. I played for 5 minutes and beat it. No trouble. Don't waste your money. Get Nintendogs Lab and friends. That's what i call a game!!!
3,Nintendo dropped the ball on this one,"Being a big fan of WarioWare on the GameCube, I really looked forward to the DS version, but they really dropped the ball on this one. The DS is geared to multiplayer, and there is NO multiplayer on this DS game. WarioWare for the GC is one of the most fun multiplayer games there is. There's no denying these minigames are fun, but that fun goes 20 minutes after playing - but when pitted against friends, these games have months and months of playability - on the DS version, you'll find yourself not playing this game after 30 minutes most.... very sad"
3,Not the best,"I hunted down a used copy of this CD, and found it to be just okay. It has a few good songs, such as the rocking ""Cat DNA"" and the pleasant, mellow numbers ""Wob Glass"" and ""Plurnstyle"", but nothing that rivals the band's best work elsewhere. The other songs, I thought, were monotonous and lacking in energy, especially the very long, very repetitive ""Vibuthi"". I'm scratching my head over why people thought this track was so great.Oh well, it seems that this CD is completely out of print anyway. There are better releases in the Ozric's large catalog, which I now have most of. The lush Arborescence and the trancy Waterfall Cities are both good choices from the band's 90's output. This one's for completists only."
3,Interesting premise,"I found this book to be an interesting look at Hillary Clinton - how her political positions and professional and personal conduct are at odds with her image of a strong, independent feminist. Overall, it was thought-provoking and Ms. Ingraham made some good points about the extremes of the current American feminism movement.However, the writing style could be distracting. Sometimes the tone was condescending and cynical, which can get in the way of a good argument by putting readers on the defensive. Also, the book is not very well documented. There are no footnotes, nor is there a bibliography or a list of sources used. Ms. Ingraham does identify some of the quotes and figures she uses within the text of her book, but not all of them, which makes it impossible to get further information on some of the claims she makes."
5,Higher Thinking about the Remora on the Shark,"To think that the people who gave this book 1 star actually read it is naive. The book is insightful into the Clintons, to peas in a political pod. Hillary Clinton ideas and though patterns are spread throughout the chapters and the reasons why she heads towards the top becomes clearer through each page of the Hillary Trap. If you want to know what Hillar is about and be informed about the election in NY, read this book. Laura is as insightful and witty as she is in her columns and on Imus in the Morning, where she can bear the scorn of the I-Man, and dish it out to Queen Hillary herself. I'd love to see Laura take on Queen Hillary in a debate of intellectuals...but the Queens Court is closed, unlike Laura, she doesn't do anything that isn't scripted."
5,The Hillary Trap,Great book. Explanations and details of the seven traps (chapters) took a great deal of effort and research on the part of the author. Also we should add GUTS. The Epilogue is extremely fair. Women have progressed very far in the various areas noted in the seven traps. One cannot feel much pride if they rely on the government or other organizations for everything. Again Great Book and will help spread that word around.
5,Insightful Ingraham,"An carefully researched entertaining analysis of Hiliary and our current culture written by a conservative without rhetoric or agenda. A must read for anyone trying to understand current politics, culture and society. It should be read by every thinking person. Expect to hear a lot more from this keen intellect."
1,Predictably banal and mean-spirited,"Gee, another right-wing rant against a favorite target. Nothing new here...except perhaps further astonishment that she's featured on MSNBC as an ""impartial"" political analyst."
1,solved problems are the worst part,Worst book if u are looking for continuumSolved examples. Concept is okay.. but the solved examples test ur patience. No problem is solved in detail. In every problem you are asked to refer to atleast two to three previous pages or some equations twenty pages behind. You end up throwing it aside by the time u try to solve one chapter
4,Not really a very good book,"Not really a very good book on continuum mechanics. However, itdoes summarise some very important points and equations usefulfor quick reference. The exercise is not so great."
5,Excellent course outline,This outline was excellent. The chapters summarize what we went over in class. The worked problems allowed for more practice actually using the theory.
4,Perfect for on-the-run singles!,"There's nothing fancy here, no high tech electronics, just a grill that does what it says. It cooks a variety of foods quite well, although it takes a little practice to get them all just right. I make burgers on mine several times a week and they come out great! The amount of grease/fat that comes off ""lean ground beef"" is amazing. The burgers retain a juicy taste while the outside is slightly crispy. Clean up is easy especially if you warm up the grill for a minute before wiping it down. All in all, a good value for a small price."
1,I guess you will be eating less fat with this product....,But don't expect to be able to taste your food.The only this this grill is good for is grilled cheese and hotdogs. It will turn a good steak into rubber and hamburgers into dried mush.
4,Useful gadget,"Great for one person, OK for two. Follow the manufacturer's instructions and use an oven mitt though - the bottom half doesn't have a handle and consequently it's easy to grab the very hot plate by mistake.Makes a great toasted cheese sandwich, especially if you turn it over half way through cooking and get crosshatched marks on the toast."
2,Cooks unevenly,"Sure, this grill is almost easier to operate than a book. The problem, however, is that it scorches the outside of your food (especially chicken) while leaving the inside undone. Unless your meat is completely defrosted and doused in oil, your food's going to come out drier than Joan Rivers."
2,"unplugging unit..no "" on-off"" switch","Ack....who wants to keep plugging and unplugging it...and the cord keeps getting in the way in the back..I'm going to 'cook' the cord one of these days, or throw the unit out.Cooks fine. but design is awful"
4,lil grillin',"I purchased this grill because everyone says the george foreman, the george foreman! So for the price why not.I have a family so it doesn't really work for me that much. I use it for grilling hot dogs and sausages. Maybe strips of chicken of beef for lunch(not for the whole family though).The cleaning is easy, clean it while it's warm, but I just don't feel that anything is REALLY clean unless you run it under water, I don't know about you. That's why I wouldn't purchase the family grill, I don't like the idea of not being able to wash it under the sink. If it were removable maybe?If you are single and don't cook much. This is the grill for you. But if cooking is your thing, invest in a nice stove top grill."
4,Nice but SMALL,"Nifty, but better for a single person. Too small for 2 people unless you're willing to cook in batches."
3,Owning a George Forman Grill,"This is a great product for a twosome dinner or a single guy or gal. Pork chops, fish and boneless ribs easily fit on the grill. The only downside of this product is there is no temperature guage. If you need to cook something a longer time, you must unplug the grill and let it cool down, then start anew or scorch the meat. However the price is right!!!"
3,has its moments but it's NOT a real grill,"I was pretty enthralled with the Foreman when I first got it and it's really nice for summertime when heating up the house with the stove is no fun. But it's not a real grill and I don't use it a ton now. Things come out a lot more like on a frying pan than a grill or even a broiler and, well, I've got a nice anodized aluminum pan or two. :) It's nice for a quick meal, though. Actually, I found that things like fried sandwiches, e.g., toasted cheese, ham and cheese, etc., come out the best, though having lines in the bread takes a bit of getting used to.BTW, defrosting the meat before you put it on the Foreman and making sure excess liquid is gone helps a lot. A brushing of vegetable oil on meat that tends to go dry is also helpful. And preheat it before you put meat on--otherwise the outside doesn't sear. Well unless you like leathery meat...."
4,good but a little small,"When I got it, it turns out that it can only serve no more than 2 people. However, when I use it, I works well. Heating fast, no stick. I'd recommend it to couples for breakfeast."
1,I won't buy another,"They are hard to clean thoroughly, it throws grease everywhere when you lift the lid and I will never waste my money on another product with this Morons name on it."
3,Get What You Pay For,"This is a good grill for one-and-a-half people, but the ""easy cleanup"" is not as easy after a few months of use. CLEAN IT WHILE IT'S HOT. This is difficult because after I cook my food I generally want to eat it, not clean the kitchen. However, if you wait to clean the grill, the food will be super-glued on. I think the non-stick material on the grill wears off over time, so this is especially true if the grill is no longer brand-new. So, my advice; Buy the grill if you're flying solo, but plan to clean it while it's still hot. Otherwise, forget it."
3,"easy to use, difficult to clean","this is a nice little grill. heats up fast & cooks evenly. but the cleanup is a real pain in the neck, or maybe i haven't figured out the best method yet. in any case, i wish i had known that before i bought it."
2,I'm VERY disappointed,"After reading the glowing reviews, I couldn't wait for my ""Champ"" grill to arrive. I just unwrapped it and it's so SMALL. What planet is the the person from who said he puts 4 burgers on at once? It may cook well, but it certaintly won't cook much."
4,It really does work.,"This is one of the few TV-advertised bits of cookware that actually lives up to its reputation. It does burgers exceptionally well- I like the way it drains off excessive moisture- often a problem with hamburger meat- instead of allowing the burger to boil in it. It's especially useful for singles and students who like to buy bags of frozen patties for quick meals.You can also do a bit of creative cooking with it, like grilling sliced vegetables brushed with olive oil and spices- try eggplants and meaty tomatoes. Marinated chicken breasts. How about shrimp? Yes, it works. Marinate shrimp in olive oil, parsely, breadcrumbs, parmesan, garlic, salt and pepper, toss them on the grill, close it and wait about a minute.It's great for kids, too. You can let kids who are too young to work over an open flame or a hot burner cook thier own lunches oin the Forman grill with a lot less worry.A surprisingly useful tool for the money."
1,george don't invite me to your house if you use this to cook,"I FOUND THIS PRODUCT TO BE A JOKE. IT'S NOT ABLE TO CONTROL TEMP. IT BURNS FOOD AND LEAVES IT RUBBERY. CLEANUP IS A JOKE. IT'S JUST ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU STICK IN THE BACK CLOSET AND NEVER USE. FORTUNATLY, I WAS ABLE TO TAKE MY BACK. I PLAN ON STICKING TO OUTSIDE BBQ'S"
5,Better than the movie,I purchased the book my child. My wife stole the book before I finished the first chapter. The book is better than the movie.You have to see the movie to understand.
5,Batchi-guu! (^-^),"I haven't read the book but I assume it's the same as the movie. I first saw this movie in Japan and I fell in love with it and all following Miyazaki movies. He has a gift when it comes to story telling. The characters, with Jiji the black cat as my favorite, are unforgettable."
3,Of limited intelligence,"Of course, it can be variously criticised, but if you're buying Deighton's spy fiction, you might want to think about having a look at the trilogies. And read them in order, too: 'Game, Set, Match' (3 stars); 'Hook, Line, Sinker' (3 1/2 stars); 'Faith, Hope, Charity' (2 1/2 stars).Of course 'The Ipcress File' was a good book, as were 'Billion-Dollar Brain' and 'An Expensive Place to Die', perhaps 'Twinkle, Twinkle Little Spy' (re-issued under the seemingly equivalent title 'Catch a Falling Spy'). ('Spy Story' is really just the best title.)"
1,Not difficult...just silly.,"Some reviewers seem to think that if you don't like this album it's because your your musical tastes are too shallow to appreciate ""difficult"" music. Wrong. The problem with this album isn't that it's difficult. There is plenty of amazing and much more challenging music out there (try a John Zorn album for instance). The problem is that Grandma's voice sounds ridiculous. She comes across as an androgynous muppet. Plain and simple, her vioce is too silly to listen to this album even halfway through. This is proof that an original concept for an album does not a good album make. Don't waste your hard earned cash on this one."
1,Don't buy!!!,"I have to agree with all the other 1 star reviews. I purchased this player exactly 2 years ago and now it is nothing more than a piece of junk!! It won't recognize any dvd I burned on it and it won't even play store bought dvd's anymore. It just says the dvd is loading forever and then kicks the dvd out. It will play a dvd sporatically but good luck getting it to work. The recording capabilities were good and easy to use but what is the point if you can't watch these dvd's just 2 years later from a crappy product! Don't buy it, I hope to spare someone else $200 and buy a quality product instead."
1,Planned Obsolescence or just Garbage?,"Like some of the other reviewers, I have been dismayed by the LACK of longevity and reliability of the this project. I have had the project for a little over a year, and now it no longer reads discs. I had the lense cleaned and it STILL DOES NOT READ DISCS!This product is garbage, like other reviewers have observed, it is nothing more than a 250 dollar VCR.Don't waste your money on a Samsung VR330, it will start crapping out in a year or less."
3,only records on 4x and 8x,"I just spoke to samsung customer service. they told me the issue with finalizing dvd's is that people are using typical 16x speed dvd's. according to them - just use the lower speed dvd's and finalizing should work. they also told me it's harder to get 8x dvd's - i find this to be a major problem, considering the rollout of higher speed dvd's.besides this major fault - i liked all the features. i think i'll return it."
3,Recurring jokes mostly funny,"This movie had so much promise at the beginning. I thought is was funny and quirky from the time he was a child and then growing up and discovering his musical talent. There were some ongoing jokes that were funny, Kristen Wiig kept showing up with more and more kids in her hands. But, it descended into stupidness after a while and I was checking the time and counting the minutes until it was over. It wasn't horrible, it held my attention and I even laughed. There was too much singing in my opinion and the songs got boring. One more thing, beware of full frontal male nudity."
4,Take a Walk on the Wild Side,"The spoof on pop culture through the era dominated by Rock-n-Roll is absolutely hilarious.Nominated for a pair of 2008 Golden Globe Awards - Best Original Song (Walk Hard) and Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy (John C. Reilly) - director Jake Kasdan captures the stylistic decadence of the ultimate rock star through the tongue-in-cheek performance by Reilly.Released on December 21, 2007, it grossed around $18 million, while staying in movie theaters for 24 days. The production budget was $35 million.But the failure at the box office is not the true measure of the comedy. The two-disc special edition is as smooth as a classic guitar solo from a legendary performer."
2,A faker with no respect for the underground.,"Though ""Rodan"" may have a somewhat original flow...no wait....I take that back...he sounds like RBL with a hangover...anyway - how in the hell are you going to take the name ""Rodan"" when you know damn well a great, if not GODLY band has taken the name first. Hip hop is hip hop. Indie is indie. But for God's sake, if you're going to try to be original, then at least start with an original name.One thumb down."
4,Small (?) bird swing,"Though this product is well made and attractive, it is definitely not small. I have a canary who never uses it because it is so big and bulky."
3,Great music!,"If you like pipe organs, and love the great hymns of the faith, you should consider this CD. Some of my favorite hymns - All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name and Holy, Holy Holy. This is volume #1, but I don't see any other volumes available.But on the flip side - there is not enough bottom end. One should feel the 32' pipes! Most other pipe organ CD's will include some details on the organ that's being played, but there's no such info here. A small shot of the show-pipes, and no stop list.But don't let that stop you!"
5,The perfect Perfume!!,"I first bought this perfume about 5 years ago and have used it interchangeably ever since. It's hard to find in the stores in the off-summer seasons, but I found it here. Quick shipping and a great price- I'll be back!"
1,too bad,love the river cottage series--hate amazon's delivery.how about a file format for everyone (not just PCs)
3,This was a wedding gift,"This was not a purchase for myself, it was for a wedding gift that Macy's did not have in stock, so I honestly cannot rate the item, but I can say that it got to my house in the time frame stated."
1,"Never made hot espresso, but now doesn't even make warm","Out of the box this never made hot espresso, it was warm at best. After a few weeks of use it didn't even warm it any more. Not worth buying. Pay more for something better that will last or you'll be stuck heating up your drink once it's made."
1,Disappointed,"I was never notified by Amazon that this product was no longer available. Finally found it ""buried"" in some information after I had waited for more than 3 weeks for delivery. I would suggest that you begin a direct notification to the ""buyer"" that the product is no longer available."
4,"i like the bad boys series,",i am a big fan of this series and enjoy all of the books connected with it. if you are a fan of this writer this book should be high on your list to check out.
1,Save your money,"I was really excited about this product because I love iced coffee and iced tea and loved the thought of having it ready instantly instead of having to make it warm and wait for it to cool.Then I used it. Eek. No. The stupid thing guzzles almost 3 trays' worth of ice cubes a pop, and no matter how much coffee or tea you use--at one point in desperation I completely filled the filter with coffee--it comes out so weak it tastes like someone just dipped a crayon in water.I practically stood on my head trying to get this thing to work, because I really wanted it to...save your money. The ""normal"" way isn't as convenient, but at least the end result is enjoyable."
4,Really good..and good value,"Replaced the Mr Iced Tea (2 qt and 3 qt) that had leaked all over the counter with this tea maker. The advantages are:1. Can make coffee in it too.2. This two quart pitcher is perfect for one to two persons.3. You can pour with the pitcher not dribbling down to the bottom and all over the counter.A couple of drawbacks are:1. Parts are not dishwasher safe (so hand wash only).2. If the lid is not put on the pitcher, the water fills the steeping basket and overflows into the water hold chamber (so that is good AND bad). Meaning you have to figure out how to pour the tea out of the water chamber and then clean it really good for the next pitcher. (Yes, I learned that from experience)3. At the end of the brew cycle it does seem quite noisy (compared to the Mr Iced Tea maker).Overall, I am well pleased with this tea maker."
3,"Too dated to be enjoyed as much as his other ""jouveniles""","Being one of his first novels (the first, perhaps?), I don'twant to be overly harsh, but this book seems quaint and silly today,even bearing in mind it was written for young readers. The Nazis arehackneyed, the kids (!) that build the ship are essentially interchangeable cliches, and the leader of the expedition is 2-dimensional.Having said that, I enjoyed parts of the book; it was certainly worth the ( ) (Canadian dollars, even) I paid for it. Read it as a nostalgic trip down memory lane from the time when men were men, women were women, and fuzzy little creatures from Alpha Centauri were fuzzy little creatures from Alpha Centauri. Oops, there I go mixing up quotes again. END"
4,depends on what you're interested in,"This book is good as a history of the children's market in the United States.However, I was looking for a summary of the psychological ploys which are used in the market, so I was somewhat disappointed."
4,Nice Pajamas,"Ordered medium at 8 1/2 months pregnant (170lbs. Fit ok- top seems to be a bit smaller than the bottoms, however after delivery the top will be fine ( a bit short now)and I am afraid the pants will then be too big- they are cut more for pregnancy. Quality material- soft and comfortable. I personally wish the sleeves were a bit narrower on shoulder- the lace seems to kinda stick out a bit which makes you look like your wearing a space suit. Overall these are a great pajama, quite flattering, I found them on sale via a amazon seller for $47.50 and got free shipping so they were worth the price- I don't think that I would pay the full price that most retailers charge for them, I do however plan to order the JW 3/4 length sleeve pajamas based on the quality of this pair and would not hesitate to pay full price."
4,"Not as good as high school, but still worth watching.","I am a huge Saved by the Bell fan. I watched it as a kid every day when I got home. I also loved the College Years as well. Now, the original gang was better than the College gang, but there are still many entertaining moments in the college years. I, for one, feel that the college years was cut way too short and thought it should have continued. I guess others didn't feel the same way though. Zack, Slater, and Screech are very entertaining in the college years and Leslie, Alex, and Kelly are good assets to the show. The theme of Zack still chasing Kelly never gets old and continues in the DVD set. If you are a fan of Saved by the Bell, I suggest the College Years to you. It's not as good as the younger years, but it's still filled with many great things that make this a great addition to your collection."
5,Pure Coffee Heaven,"You have never had real coffee the way it was meant to be until you use this machine. I purchase only coffee from the High Andes in Peru and purchase roasted chicory root from half way around this country to get what I consider the best cup of coffee possible. But it is this machine that brings it all together. The only thing I don't particularly care for about it is the grind settings, which are 1-7. I use setting one and still the coffee is ground too finely for my taste. Still, this machine produces the absolute best cup of coffee you can get."
5,"Mmmmm, coffee","I've been using my Melitta for two months. It is an excellent machine. The quality surprised me, considering the low price. The timer feature is nice for those early mornings. Cleanup is easy. If you're looking for a grind and brew, this is the only choice."
2,"Great coffee, but...","We had two of these units, and both made great coffee, but...The latch does break, and you end up holding it down with a weight in order to make coffee. Also, the temperature tends to be be toward the warm side, as opposed to hot.These problems should be easy to fix, and obviously they are very common, as seen from other reviews.As a result, I am now looking for a non Melitta coffeemaker with great coffee and fewer problems."
5,Works Well,"I do not usually review products but I bought this based on the reviews that I read online and they were right. This product is far superior to the $250 model that I had to replace after limited use. The grind feature only holds enough beans for one use at a time but this allows you to keep the beans in a place where they can be sealed and remain fresh. It is easy to use and clean, makes good coffee and for the price it can not be beat."
2,"Malita as in spanish for ""little bad one""!",I purchased this coffemaker just under a year ago and lid is already broken. I have to place heavy object to brew coffee.I also shattered the glass pot trying to figure out how tokeep the lid down. I just went to target and purchased a new Mr Coffee. Let's see how long this one will last. But at the very least it will be convenient to return it and get a full refund should it fail to perform.I have to say the coffee was good while it lasted.I am very disappointed since I purchased it for over one hundred dollars.I just recently saw it going for half that price.I guess you get what you pay for.
2,Too much money for a disposable appliance!,"We have owned three of these pots and the lids on all three have disintegrated after a few months of use. Also, due to the design of the grinder/filter basket you need to use more beans to get strong enough coffee. The grinds stick to the top and sides of the filter instead of falling to the bottom of the basket. If you don't mind these two shortfalls, this pot does however make a great tasting cup of coffee. We will never go back to Mr. Coffee and pre-ground coffee. Our next one will be the Quisinart model."
1,Just plain awful!,"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work a coffee maker, but it obviously takes one to make a decent pot of coffee with this machine. I am completely dumbfounded by this unit. I based my purchase on the other recommendations, but now I am wondering whether these people actually know what a good pot of coffee tastes like. I brewed to the exact specifications in the manual and then went hunting on the internet for optimal brewing methods with an automatic drip and nothing produced even close to a decent cup of coffee. Calls to Melitta and the parent company Salton where fruitless, so back to ...(the store) this product went. For those of you who drink coffee at work, this machine makes coffee less desirable than the last cup which has been sitting on the burner for several hours."
2,Melitta coffee mill and maker,"The product is a good one. I'm very satisfied with the coffee maker but more than that I am very happy with the service I received from Amazon in ordering the product.The transaction was fast, smooth and very satisfactory! I'll be back!"
4,Use a finer grind,"Try upping the grind settings and using a little more coffee. I can brew a really strong cup with this maker. With the convenience and easy cleanup compared to other similar models, this is a good buy."
5,The Best CoffeMaker!,This is a good deal!! It's easy to use and makes a great cup of coffee. If you want a grind and brew this is the one to get!! And did you know you can get it in white??
5,"loud, but great for coffee lovers","this mill & brew coffeemaker is loud, but if you don't care you'll love it! and the fresh mill and brewed coffee tasts great, much better than the pre-ground coffee. and is less expensive than cuisinart"
4,This is the one.,"The Cuisine Art that we replaced was no match. The Melitta is 100% a better product and much easier to clean. The grinder is stelth compared to the Cuisine Art. My only complaint is the warmer shuts off after an hour. No paper filters makes this coffee maker the best I have ever had.Thanks Amazon, Im hooked."
4,Good Coffee,"We're quite pleased with this coffee maker. It's easy to clean and fill. The only draw back is if you lose power you lose your settings and time. Most of our other appliances can hold the settings for a couple of minutes, this unit does not retain any settings, it defaults to manufacturer defaults. Do NOT overfill the water reservoir, it will leak out the back hole at the top.It grinds well and the coffee is good. It has an hour to keep the coffee warm, then shuts off."
2,good coffee --lousy construction,"I bought this coffee make about 8 months ago --it worked marvelously and made great coffee, however after about 6 months the latch on the grinder side quit working -- to get warranty or replacement takes forever and this is a common problem that melitta is aware of --- FOREWARNED"
5,Java BLISS!,"This is by far the best home coffeemaker I have ever owned. It makes a perfect cup of coffee...you choose the level of ""grind"" for your coffee, set it up the night before and you have a perfect cup of java waiting for you when you get up. It is easy to use and very easy to clean. The only thing that would make this any better is if they replaced the glass pot with a carafe to keep it warm."
5,melitta is great,"We purchased this coffee-maker to replace an older model.The combination product of a grinder and brewer is exactly what we were looking for.Works great, fresh ground hot coffee, and clean up is a breeze.Highly recommend."
2,"Good Feature, Not durable",I've had this coffee makers for about two years. The fliter basket tears easily and can only be replaced through the manufacturer (about $10). The latch that locks the cover of the grinder basket has just broken off for the second time. I replaced it(purchased through Melitta) but had to take the lid apart. I loved the ease of use and fact that it has a permanent filter but the burner plate rusted and is not easily cleaned so I'm going to try a different brand this time.
4,Almost Perfect,This is a cool product. I would have given it 5 stars but it shuts off after an hour and sometimes I don't drink my coffee that fast. It doesn't use a paper filter so it needs to be rinsed out. I'm sure most people have excellent plumbing but I live in an older home and this worries me. I love the timer and the not having to grind the whole beans in another gadget. All in all this is a good product.
3,It's great but....,"I've had this coffeemaker since 11/03. It really works nicely (makes good coffee, very easy to clean), although I have no other grind & brew coffeemakers to compare it with, like Cuisinart. There are only two ""negatives"" that I can think of regarding my Melitta. (1.) I put 5 scoops of beans in the basket for 10 cups of coffee and 1/3 of the whole beans were left after brewing. So you can't ""brew"" 10 cups. It will hold 10 cups of liquid but I found that I cannot grind that amount. (2.) The coffee brews whether you have the carafe under it or not. One very sleepy morning I added the beans and the water but forgot to put the carafe on the burner. 8 cups of steamy hot coffee went all over my hard wood floor. The instructions don't tell you about that!!!"
5,Best coffeemaker I've ever owned,"I love this coffeemaker, it's the only one that ever consistently ground and brewed coffee in the same filter. Sadly, mine died today, and it looks like this is no longer made. There's really nothing on the market that can replace this."
5,Parts Are Available To Fix The Melitta Mill & Brew,"This is the greatest coffee maker on the planet. I just wanted to let everyone know that parts are available to fix that little latch on the top cover that breaks all the time or if your brew basket wears out. I have kept mine running for more than 5 years, and have replaced just 3 parts. Just call Customer Service at 1-800-738-1792 Access Code 0000 if you need a part for the Melitta Mill & Brew. The parts are cheap and the coffee maker is easy to repair."
5,Best of the Grinder/Brewers,"This is by far the best of the grind and brew machines out there. It grinds the beans in the same cup it brews them in (wire mesh filter), so you don't have to worry about a chute clogging, or not making dark roasts (oily beans clog the chute more easily). It is a good idea to read the instructions, but you have to experiment with the bean to water ratio to reach a strength level you like. I have had mine since last Christmas, and it still works. Other machines have had problems after a couple months. You have to clean all the parts after use, but it isn't any more work than a regular coffee maker or French Press. Moreover, this machine is much cheaper than the rest. Remember, when it comes to grind and brews, simpler is better, so is the Melitta."
3,Lasted only a year...,"Like my last Melitta, this one also only lasted about a year (11 months to be exact). I purchase a DeLonghi this time and am even happier with the taste (the quality of the DeLonghi seems better too... I'll let you know in 11 months!)."
4,Great but not perfect,"It does the job; it grinds the beans and brews coffee. But there is a couple of things they can improve.1. When it grinds the bean, the coffee powder sticks to the lid and the top edge of the basket. Unless you stop the machine when grinding is finished and brush all the powder to the bottom of the basket, you'll end up with very thin watery coffee.2. The measuring marks on the canister and the water tank don't match. 3 Cups in the canister is only 2 cups in the water tank. This is some silly oversight.3. I tried to use it as a coffee grinder for my Espresso machine. Even though the basket was completely dry, some powder still stuck in the bottom. And I couldn't get it all off. I wish I had bought a nice coffee grinder instead of this machine.But if you are looking for a simple coffee maker with a grinder attached, this might be the one."
4,Replacement Carafe Availability,"I recently purchased the Melitta Mill and Brew 10 cup coffeemaker and thoroughly enjoyed using it; however, while washing the carafe, I broke the lip off. I have found it impossible to locate a replacement carafe! I have contacted Melitta North America, Salton, various retail outlets: Target, Wal-Mart, etc. and have not been able to find out where I can purchase a replacement carafe. If I had any idea that it would be so hard to find a replacement carafe--I would have NEVER bought this coffeemaker. I'm very disappointed."
1,Melitta fails in customer service...,"After having read all of the customer reviews, I decided to purchase this model. However, I could never get the timed brew program to function. I called customer service and was given a most unacceptable way of dealing with the defect. I had to return the coffee maker to them and wait anywhere from 6-8 weeks for a replacement. For the money spent on this machine I expected better quality and definitely better customer service."
2,One Unforgivable flaw.,"Good news first. This coffee maker makes very good coffee. Like the ability to adjust the grind to our taste. The grinder/filter combination makes it easy to clean. Not overly loud when grinding.Now, the rest of the story. This coffee maker has a fatal flaw. The ""pause and pour"" feature simply does not work. When the pot is removed within less than 10-15 minutes after the brewing has stopped coffee drips onto the burner. Enough drips that it actually will overflow onto the counter. So, if you love the smell of burnt coffee in the morning, plus scrubbing burnt on coffee off the bottom of the carafe, then this is your machine. We have already bought another brand."
2,"If you love having coffee grinds in your cup, buy this one!","If you love having coffee grinds in your cup, the Melitta Mill and Brew is for you. A few months after purchasing the unit the permanent filter basket develop a hole which caused the grounds to leak into the freshly brew coffee. It's cheaper to buy another coffee maker than to replace the permanent filter basket. I just love all those little black specs flowing in my coffee. It's a special treat to share with your closest friends."
4,The Tooth Fairy by Peter Collington,"This is an excellent book for children who are not yet able to read fluently. Children are able to utilize their imagination in order to form the ""words"" to the story. The illustrations are inviting and the subject matter is something that most children can easily identify with. As an elementary education teacher, I would recommend this book to grades K-3 for pleasure reading, as well as 4-6 to assist in developing sequential story writing."
5,very life-giving!!,We got this due to a recommendation from a great speaker and teacher. We started reading it and the faith-filled testimonies have already begun to affect our life.
4,Earl Murray Author not Jon Land,"Blood and Bitter Wind was an interesting book, defining the spirit of those who got wealthy off the toil of those seeking a ready made fortune. The problem of orphans due to Gold Fever and the readiness of those spirits who made Los Angeles ""The city of Angels"" is a pretty parallel to what one might find today in Los Angeles. Always those willing to lend a hand and make a better world for the less fortunate. There was a good discription of Puddingstone, which is in Bonelli Park, right where Raging Waters is in San Dimas.Unless my book was the only one that had it printed in it...It states that the author died just after completing the book.Wherever he is I wish him many peaceful and happy trails."
3,love the product - shipping took too long,This product is great for cooking and has no taste at all so no one will know the difference. I like the fact that it is a much healthier oil. As far as shipping....it just took waaay to long. It took a month before it arrived. So because of this I gave 3 stars
3,"great game, but beware","Hey all, this is a great pokemon game! So many additions to ruby and sapphire versions, old, but my favorite of all 5 generations.Be careful buying emerald version online- many are fake bootlegs. but if you get a genuine game, or you don't mind the bootleg, then it's awesome!"
5,so fun but gets boring,this game is fun i already beat it and it is kind of boring now but once i catch 40 more pokemon i get a Johto starter
1,pokemon emerald version,This game did not work. We contacted seller with complaint that game does not work. She replaced game with another one that did not work.We are not happy.
3,Pokemon craze,"Everyone remembers the Pokemon phenomenon six years ago. It came on the scene and burst into everyones home. Now, all these years later, how do the games hold up?Well, this is the most recent one, and it's pretty good. Pokemon Emerald features a pretty good challenge for an RPG-like game. You'd think Nintendo would have lowered the difficulty, but not this time.This is just another Pokemon game that happens to be pretty good at keeping you attached to it. Pick it up."
3,Great game.... But fake,Pokemon emerald was my first pokemon game and i loved it i got it when it first came out. The only problem is that if your looking to by a use game it going to be fake... This means that you can't trade and it will most likely to corrupt after beating elite four. If your a collector get it new if not well don't get attached
5,Combined games and more,"Pokemon Emerald is like a combination of Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire, with a bit of a new story, with moving pokemon and a new island, the battle fronteer! What could be better than that? Because these games are combined, there are more oppertunities to catch pokemon that weren't in the other versions, and make it more interesting to see pokemon in battles or the wild. The battle fronteer makes it worthwile to play the game after it is beaten. I think this was a great idea for nintendo to do."
1,Broken game,When I received this game Iy would not work and I had to take it to a game repair shop to have it fixed :(
4,"Dissatisfied With Seller, But Good Game","Seller backed out at the last minute, never received game, got a refund. However, I have purchased it from another source, and I do enjoy it. Having been a fan of the series since it's initial iteration, these are games that have stuck with me throughout the rest of my teen years all the way up until now, at 24. I know this seems a bit pathetic, but hey...good games stick with you."
1,FAKE? BEWARE!,"I just got the Emerald version (used) and tested it out. Apparently, the game cartridge shows the sticker that is NOT SHINY. A REAL Emerald version has a SHINY sticker, this one does not. And when starting the game after pressing start, the message, ""The save file will be loaded. The game can be played."" That message is not suppose to appear on the screen unless it says the file was deleted or the internal battery was dead. I am not satisfied. Beware if the sticker on the cartridge is not shiny, because if it's not shiny, then it's a fake. Do not buy it if the sticker on the game is not shiny or if a message appears that says something about a save file or if the game can be played. Beware!"
3,eh,"not as good as the fire and leaf green versions, you start off with few to catch and the pokenav is brutal to get people to start a battle. if fun to check out new places but I just wish they followed the formula of the other 2"
3,Not worth $94.98,"This game is OK, but I just looked at the new price tag: $94.98? DON'T BUY THIS GAME AT THAT HIGH A PRICE. It's not worth almost a hundred dollars. Christ..."
3,I like it overall,This is a good juicer overall. The only problem I found with it that I wouldnt have even considered was that it isnt dishwasher safe. This means that clean up takes awhile.
3,They Couldn't Top The Longest Journey,"Actually, in my opinion, they didn't even equal The Longest Journey.The Longest Journey is a classic and I dare say all ages have played it. Dreamfall is apparently meant to appeal to the younger gamers, with action sequences which don't appeal to someone like me. I like the adventure, the mystery, the story.The graphics are excellent and the puzzles are not too outlandish. You also play at different times as 3 different characters.This particular package was a great deal, as it contains the original Longest Journey, Dreamfall and the Dreamfall soundtrack, so you get a lot for your money."
3,Misleading Product Information,"For the record, the game rating given is for The Longest Journey and not Dreamfall -- which I haven't started playing yet. It's installing as I type.This package does NOT come with the bound artbook as promised, which was disappointing. It also doesn't come with a manual for some bizzare reason.The Longest Journey is a beautiful game -- graphics, sound, voice acting, story, everything. I have high hopes for Dreamfall as well."
4,Good compounding reference,"This book helped me complete many pre-lab assignments. I found the calculations to be a little hard to follow once in a while, but overall a good reference."
3,A quick year,"The book gives a quick overview of a long journey. It's an easy read, but the details are thin for anyone looking to make this journey. ""Honey, Let's Get A Boat"" provides better information and detail than ""Our Year"". Most of the pictures and maps appear to be borrowed from cruising guides. It does give some highlights, that are extracted from newsletters the author wrote - which is the impression I got while reading it - a compendium of personal newsletters to friends, rather than for someone looking to make this journey."
4,"Henry Flashman, is not ""a flash in the pan""","Once again despite himself, Flashy comes to the rescue. More than once, says I, and mostly for himself after he'd gotten himself into hot water once again. The story of course is once again inconsequential, but the fun is seeing how many situations Flashy can get himself into, and the remarkable ways that he gets himself out, say I.The one really extraordinary thing that we learn about Flashy is that even among other men, his manhood is admired as 'above average'. That Fraser can take another story, and turn it around so that you would swear that the other guy is guilty of plagarism is just another piece of the Flashy legend.All in all, says I, a rip-roaring tale of a man without a consience, says he; who seems to do his damndess to preserve and protect other people's honor.Four huzzahs for the Flash-man."
5,Reactionary romp through revolutionary Europe,"Just finished reading this. It's been over a year since Our Man read the first Flashman novel, so forgive him if he fails to compare the two accurately. Perhaps the first was more enjoyable simply because Flashman as a character was a wondrous discovery; this time round he was more of a known entity.But whatever, this is a great reactionary romp through revolutionary 1848 Europe, and Flashman has his way with the Queen of Bavaria and bests Bismarck at his Realpolitikin' to boot.Great politically-incorrect fun and a parody of The Prisoner of Zenda too. Just love the character and the liberties Fraser takes with history and his refusal to take himself, the character or the genre too seriously.So glad he wrote a dozen more."
5,Scars and Stripes,"This is a great album. It's powerful and touches the heart, especially if you're going through a hard time and need some healing."
3,With some reservations...,"I agree with almost everything that the previous reviewer has said about this most enjoyable album, but there is one major caveat: Mr. Phyfe's pronunciation of foreign languages ranges from adequate to downright painful. His French, in particular, is so poor that it is a real distraction from his admittedly wonderful singing. Everything else about this recording, and its sequels, is first-rate."
2,A NICE LITTLE DISK BUT FALLS SOMEWHAT FLAT,"While there is no way you can say that Selena's music is at fault here, something certainly is. ""Exitos y Recuerdos"" houses some Selena favorites such as ""Como La Flor"" and the crowd-pleasing ""Baila Esta Cumbia"" but for the most part, the album should be renamed ""Entre a Mi Mundo-repackaged"". With most of its songs originating from that album, the extra (but great) songs just seem to be something thrown in. This 7-track disk is nothing more than a K-mart single, and a K-mart single they keep re-releasing and re-releasing, so far with 3 different covers. Is this to fool us into buying all three? Or tugging at the heart-strings of an avid Selena collector? One never knows. If you want a true Selena album, buy ""Entre a mi Mundo."" Or anything else for that matter."
2,Very Complicated to Use,"The product is very difficult to use. There are too many gadgets to mess around with. Trying to figure out how the temperature system works is ridiculous. The rotisserie bar and brackets rusted after only two uses. I gave it 2 stars because once you figure out how to use it, the food really tastes good."
5,Thumbs up,"I am very impressed with the rotisserie. I found it very easy to set up, to clean and to remove food from. The control are really very logical once you read the instruction booklet. (I don't think you could operate it without reading the booklet.) The unit is huge and should be on its own cart or table. I wouldn't use it under a cabinet. I found the cooking times to be on par with using an oven if you use all three heating elements. I have made two large chickens, a pork roast, and a small roast beef in it. The results were excellent. It is very important to add water to the tray. This results in smokeless cooking and extremely easy cleanup. I suggest using higher cooking temperature than recommended. Definitely, a thumbs up product!"
1,no instructions included,We recently received a George Foreman Rotisserie. When we opened the box....we did not receive an instruction book ofr anything on how to use it! We are not sure what to do?????
1,ROTISSERIE,"I was very upset the rotisserie was cracked & broken . But I Love the machine & want another one .I feel it was damaged in shipping. ups said they would look it over.Thank you, Dolores"
3,Great but faulty,"Rotisserie worked great for two chickens (trial runs) and then on Christmas Eve, with a 12lb turkey slowly turning, browning and dripping and just starting to smell great, guests arriving at the door - there was a bang, a flame, and the motor blew up! We assume that faulty wiring was the cause and are giving the Big George another try; we really liked the slow roasted tender taste (of the trial chickens) and hope that when we get the new one, it will not disappoint us. Oh, that half roasted turkey ended up in the oven fighting for space with all kinds of other food and was, well, just another turkey!"
5,Great Rotisserie & Oven!,"This oven really works great! It's simple to use and easy to clean.... It's a large oven fit for conventional baking as well as rotisserie baked goods. One of its best features is a temperature control that actually works! It really is a multipurpose cooking appliance. As a single male, even I could not [mess] it up!"
3,Not a book on how to invent,"This is a book on history and social conditions of invention. It should be categorized as a history book. As such,it is a book bordering on personal speculation. It would be much better if Wiener had stick to his own scientific field and written a book on how to invent or discover."
3,"Lou is just in a ""try something new"" phase","I like this cd. Lou has turned into a great musician without being a virtuoso guitar player. The arrangements are sparce and intriguing. ""Small Town"", ""How do you think it feels"" and ""All Tomorrows Parties"" are the best songs. ""Candy Says"" is different (the singer Antony Johnson is a bit overdramatic) but a worthy intrepretation. ""Dirty Blvd"" has been toned down but its still good.Lou made a concert with no drums...can't fault him for trying something different. Compare this to his acoustic cd, I think this is much better! He takes Velvet Underground songs in interesting directions.For all of you ripping this cd, the fact that you even bought it means that you are a big fan (he has never been mainstream stuff). If this act, played like on the cd, came to your town, you would go see it in a heartbeat!Adventerous sometimes can lead to dissappointments but can also lead to huge payoffs. The plusses greatly outweigh any minuses on this live cd."
3,"The Cat in The Hat Comes Back. Good for him, I guess.","Apparently, Dr. Seuss had a George Lucas moment, and decided that he hadn't run his opus creation into the ground properly. This sequel picks up in the winter time, where the woman who abandoned her young children in the first book decides that she should make them shovel snow while she goes out. The latchkey kids are tortured by the cat in the hat. Again. The fish from the first book is not present to freak out over everything, he probably died, or asked for too much to come back for the sequel ala Crispin Glover in Back to the Future. My kid still likes this book, but he's a toddler. So there you go."
2,Very Old Designs,"I was really disappointed in this book. The designs look like they are all from the 70's, and not the ""good"" type of 70's designs. I did get some basic construction ideas, but overall, I would not buy this book again."
2,What is and is not is hard to know,Children will wonder after they have read this book what is real and what isnt. I have always taught my children straight form the Torah. This book adds all kinds of invented stories to explain certain things such as why moses stuttered(it says he sucked on a Hot coal as a baby). My children who were aware of the actual account kept wanting to know as I read to them if certian events had took place or were made up. It was confusing and I dont think embellishing is OK when it comes to G-ds word.
2,Not tan at all,I received these shirts to wear under my flight suit but they are more of an Air Force greenish tan than brown tan. Not what I expected from the picture. Also I ordered large and the necks are huge and look like crap. I cannot wear these in a military uniform. They may be good if you work as a mechanic and need a grease rag that is why I will give two stars.
4,Shirts serve my son well,These khaki t shirts are just what my son wanted. He is a contractor in a very hot location. They are cool and absorbent. He loves them.
3,Not worth the price...,"I'm usually a very positive gamer. However, Touch and Go left me feeling disappointed...First off, Yoshi just keeps moving forward. You have no control over him. You can only scribble clouds so he doesn't fall to his doom, in which case, you have to start the single level again.Oh yes, you can touch the screen the to shoot and egg.Um-yay?Please, use the $30 you would use to buy this game for something better. For true touch-screen innovation, pick Kirby Canvas Curse or WarioWare:Touched! For a plain fun game, I reccomend Super Mario 64 DS. Happy Shopping, all!"
5,happy,love my game i wanted it for so long so happy you had it cheaper so i could get it for myself for x-mas
4,Old and New,"Listen I really liked Super Mario Advance 3, but this one isn't as good.It was really fun to do the new controls and find out what stuff Yoshi can do. So If you're a newcomer to type of game it might be better for you.I'm a huge Nintendo fan, but there are some times for when they let you down.In Nintendo power they show you some screenshots and the screen shots have more of a Gameboy game graphic then a Nintendo DS. The Graphics in super Mario 64 Ds were great, but this one isn't as 3D at all.As for the new cloud type features with the stylus I have to give Nintendo some credit. It does get boring kinda fast though. It may be worth the 30 dollars, but if you're getting something good for easter I would go the paper mario or Super Mario 64 DS ( Unless you played super mario 64 )"
4,A completely new gaming experience,"From the moment I first played Yoshi Touch & Go, I knew it was nothing like anything I had ever played before. The game uses the themes of Yoshi's Island from the SNES era, but in this game, rather than controlling Yoshi directly, Yoshi walks on his own and you have to draw clouds on the touch screen to help him cross pits and trap enemies and coins in bubbles so he can retrieve them. You can also tap Yoshi to make him jump, and keep tapping him to make him stay in the air longer. YT&G resembles an arcade game in many ways, such as the fact that the only goal you are trying to accomplish is to get the highest score (which can be very hard). You start out with 2 game modes, Score Attack (trying to get the high score) and Marathon (an endless game where you simply try to get as far along the path as possible). The very fast gameplay takes a while to get used to, but once you get into the game, you'll find it to be highly addictive and very fun."
4,Big Momma is Back With a Vengeance!!!,"I don't understand why this movie is receiving such low ratings. I thought it was a really good and very funny sequel. It's like a mix of The House Bunny and Sorority Boys. Malcolm's son, Trent is out of high school and wants to pursue a music career. While trying to get him to sign a contract, Trent witnesses a murder on his dad's stakeout. Malcolm and Trent are forced to go undercover and disguise themselves as Big Momma and Charmaine at an all girls college. Big Momma becomes the new den mother to the Divas. At night, Big Momma is trying to find a flashdrive that can put a Russian gangster in jail for life. Meanwhile, Trent is slowly falling in love with Haley. I highly recommend BIG MOMMAS: LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON!!!"
4,great game for the kids,my 2 young grand daughters ages 5 and 6 both love it. it teaches them visual skills and they quite often beat me!!!
4,Great Product,"Great Product and Great cooking! Its easier just to slap something on this thing after a long day of work, then to get some pots and pans all dirty. ..."
1,What is the hype about?,"I used this thing once and I wish I had never bought it. It does not ""infuse"" anything and my chicken had to be finished in the microwave. We much prefer out grill outside to this joke of a cooking item. It is also huge which makes storing it difficult. I have given it to a very happy neighbor and just use my gas grill."
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT,"This product is far more limited with regard to use than first thought! When I received mine, it had missing parts making it useless. The construction is not as sturdy and solid as many others like it, but the biggest strike against it is the lack of versatility in cooking."
2,A new concept? You're kidding me!,"I find it surprising the way that some business authors claim that they are creating a brand new concept on how to manage something - in this case the brand, using the ""Brand Asset Management"" concept - when in fact they are only repackaging old and traditional concepts - in this case, marketing and brand concepts - and giving them fancy names (BrandPicture, BrandContract, etc). Don't be surprised if you feel as if you're reading your old marketing or brand management textbook in a new paperback format. It is as if Kotler had rejuvenated himself and lost some weight.There is absolutely nothing new on what the author proposes. From defining the ""Brand Vision"" to implementing it through communications, pricing, and channel strategy, the only positive someone can take out of this book is that it summarizes everything in 250 pages."
4,Dissertation turned into a book -- useful for research,"Captured in June 1864 by government forces, Li Hsiu-ch'eng spent the final days before his inevitable execution writing a personal account of the Rebellion and his role in it. His deposition is the fullest narrative by a participant and an invaluable historical document. The original manuscript was withheld by the government commander Tseng Kuo-fan and his descendants, and a shorter, bowdlerized version prepared for publication. Dr. Curwen's translation is from the original and includes an introduction and extensive commentary. The translation is 150 pages and Curwen's end notes are 125 pages. The notes highlight where Tseng Kuo-fan and others made changes to the original for their version in order to disparage the Taipings. This aspect of the author's treatment is useful for getting inside the psyche of the government forces and has parallels in in contemporary Chinese treatment of the Falun Gong. Overall a good scholarly book."
2,Disappointing,"I have many types of divination cards which I collect for fun, their wisdom and their beauty. Some have beautiful creative illustrations. These cards are very disappointing. The illustrations are amateurish and the reproduction of the images is dull and lacking depth. I bought 3 sets and am returning 2 that I purchased for gifts. I would never give this to anyone as a gift. (I am only keeping the 3rd set because I wrote on one of the cards.)"
3,Mixed bag,"No laugh-at-loud moments from this gentle comedy. Unfortunately, no characters that you care about either.I enjoyed one of this author's books when I read it about thirty years ago, but this one left me cold too often. I did like, very much, that the author had enough respect for his readers to send them scurrying to the dictionary to look up and learn a few of his words, which I did half a dozen times."
2,Freezing issues,"At first, this system worked really well. After about half an hour of use, it started freezing up the game. I reset it a few times, hoping it was just a glitch. Unfortunately, it continued. It is a bit aggravating as I have kids that take turns using the system. I would recommend getting one from a used game store that you can easily return it to instead."
3,nintendo 64 bundle,"We had quite a LONG wait to get this item. Apparently the first bundled package got lost in the mail and after 11 days they mailed out a new bundled unit. I was a bit anxious to get it on time for Christmas, since I did order it 3 weeks before Christmas and it didnt come til Dec.22nd this was not good. The unit was not in collector condition, it was scratched dirty and one of the controllers had electrical tape on it. We tested it out and it seemed to work ok. This was a Christmas gift for our college aged daughter and she was real happy to get it. They made it right by adding a few extra games to the second order."
1,What Ninetendo 64 Video Game Console..,I never did receive the product and I had to ask for a refund because this seller apparently doesn't have the products that he is advertising. Very disappointing!!
4,Nintendo 64,"This thing was in awsome condision! The two things that was a bummer was that, 1: the reset button gets stuck when you press it but after about 15 seconds it goes away. 2: It did NOT come with a controller. But mine come with an expansion pak. But anyway. THIS THING IS AWSOME!"
4,The classic that never gets old!,"This is the best.Better then xbox,ps2,gamecube combined.Buy it at your local ebgames for like $11.99 with 1 controller and buy super mario 64 and mario kart 64 and Super smash bros and Madden 2002.The graphics are great for a system released in 1996.I still play mine.I also own the Xbox with Halo2 and xbox live.{sukboy31 is my gamertag.}I also own the slime PS2.And the Silver gc.They are great but not as good as the n64.I also own the ds and the gameboy micro and the gameboy color and the gameboy advance sp.Bye now!!!"
3,Nintendo System,"The system is in great shape, however we were sent a defective remote to go with it and we couldn't use it. We had to go out to a local store to buy a new remote just so could play."
5,Buy it!!!,"This is the best console you can get becides gamecube of course but if you do not use it all of the time like me get because the racing game are great for games I like San Francisco Rush, San Francisco Rush 2049 and California Speed."
2,this is the worst system ever!,the graphics are so blurry it will nauseate you. the n64 couldonly appeal to children under 12 years. you would be better off withthe old 8 bit or even a sega saturn! END
1,A Real Disappointment.,"This mixer is underpowered - it cautions that no stiff dough or mixture over 8 ounces should be mixed. It is not clear why they even bother to pack a dough-hook given the power. But that's not all. The bowls are shaped badly, so material accumulates in the sharp angle and escapes mixing. They are so narrow that adding ingredients without hitting the beaters is tricky. And finally, the beater release button is a chore to operate. We once had confidence in Farber products. No more."
4,Nice Pans,"Even though the pans make only fix large muffin tops, they bake beautifully and clean up easily. They will scratch if mishandled but proper care eliminates that risk. I use them often and truly enjoy the results."
5,Touch's The Heart,"This album will invoke memories of troubadors in days gone by, but the haunting melodies, lyrics and vocals are current and touched my heart as very few albums have ever done. The ballad's form pictures in my mind, like a movie playing out through the songs. One if the best album's I own."
3,Not Quite THAT Bad,"Decent sound, unbalanced as prior reviewer pointed out, but still better than any audience recordings of Elvis in that period. The setlist is very good and the band is still super, even if Elvis is down one or two notches from the previous years. For fans, not just die-hards."
4,A very entertaining CD (if you know what you're getting),"Please note that this is a soundboard recording and not as crystal clear as some other live recordings. If you are familiar with soundboard recordings, however, this CD is among the best soundboards I have heard. This isn't Elvis live in 1970, but for Elvis' 1975 live recordings, these are also the best performances I have heard. A minimum of joking and flubbing lyrics during songs (Elvis joked during songs more frequently in his later performances) and overall, a very listenable and varied songlist. If you are not a fan of Elvis' live performances in 1975, then you probably won't enjoy this CD, but otherwise, I would recommend it."
2,George Forman Grill,"This is an overrated machine which lacks a heat control and because of that, it tends to overcook and sometimes burn food if great care is not exercised. Had I known it lacked heat control, I would not have purchased it and do not recommend it."
1,Company wouldn't respond to my problems with this grill,"From the beginning, the bottom would overheat much more than the top and the foods would burn quickly, even when I reduced the pre-heat time considerably. I also seasoned and cleaned it just like they said. I emailed the company and heard no personal response at all, only received a shipping label in the mail two whole months later - at least, I think it was from them, hard to tell, no letter or anything. I didn't send it back because I had no idea what would happen if I did. So I consider it a lot of money wasted, and it definitely costs more than it's worth. I was very unhappy with the grill for this reason, the only way I could use it was to constantly turn foods - and they still burnt. But I was most unhappy with the company. I won't buy from them again. I found a Health Mate grill that performs much better. Get with it, George! Great concept, poor performance."
3,Buy a different model George Foreman - This is not the best.,"We owned a smaller model 20 George Foreman for a couple of years and found it to be very good. Although all of these Foreman products lack an on-off switch, and the heated trays cannot be removed for cleaning, the model 20 was durable and not that hard to clean. It also cooked fine as far as temperature control was concerned. However, we needed a larger grill, so we got this model. It is not the same quality. The grill tends to overheat, and burn food. In other words, from an engineering point of view, the differential settings on the factory installed fixed thermostat are too great. In addition, the non-stick coating has worn off in less than a year, making it very hard to clean. We did not have this problem with the other model 20. Although we like the Foreman grill concept, next time we will look hard for a grill this size with removable plates that had a more durable coating and an adjustable thermostat."
4,Love how this toy ties in with Duplos,"Finally, someone figured out that we don't want to spend money on expensive specialized parts to build the supporting towers for a marble run game! This game fits together with ordinary Duplos (or Megablocks) to give the run some height. My children and I love it! But it could be even better if they included more ""corner"" pieces. I would also like to have some fancier pieces to create more options for the marble paths, such as a single piece that turns the corner or goes straight, or some kind of ""Y"". And it is difficult to align the ""drop-through"" over another run, because of how the Duplo-like pieces fit together."
1,Unhappy customer,"I was so happy with my huge slow cooker that my son bought me for Christmas, however I failed to fill out and send in the warrenty card. Had only used it 3 or 4 times before last Sunday when I fixed a pot roast in it as a welcome home dinner for my Husband, who had been out of town 3 weeks. Had it planned to be ready when I returned from picking him up at the airport. You can imagine how upset I was to find it cracked and all the liquid in the cooking part, and my roast sitting high and dry in the cracked pot. I intend to try to return it, but no doubt I will be be turned away empty handed, having no receipt and as I said I did not fill out the warrenty card. I would appreciate any help you can give me. Thanks in advance for your assistance in this matter and I eagerly await your reply.P SawonSpring Texas"
1,Exterior exposed lip reaches 250 degrees on auto setting,"I returned this the day it arrived. I heated the obligatory 4 cups of water as per instructions. Left the room and came back in 20 minutes. The warning light was not lit. I moved the crock to the side to see if I had not properly plugged it in since the light was out. I brushed my hand against the exterior lip and received a first degree burn. Farberwear company customer service said ""the light is a little dim"" but you should be able to see it. Yes, you can see it if you look up from below the crockpot you will see a faint glow. The crock pot sits very loosely in its container leaving a large gap between the food container and the heater housing.Heat escapes through these gaps which accounts for the overheated exterior. I would advise those with kids, especially, to find another slow cooker."
1,Dont purchase from this company,"Company sent the wrong product, told us politely that they would reship a new correct one. Did not receive the new one for a week, when we contacted them they realized a shipping error returned the second one. Finally received the correct product after 3+ weeks. Not exactly easy."
1,it burn my grass,I followed instructions and did a test patch. My entire test area is yellow. My backyard looks odd with a section of bright yellow and everything else green. i would do a small test patch before use!
4,Timberland Men's Kia Wah Bay Boat ShoeI,I am very pleased with this product. I have bought boat shoes in the past & find them more comfortable in informal settings than exercise shoes. What I like about these shoes is having shoe strings. I paid a little of above what I normally pay but am happy with the quality of these shoes.
4,"Very good beats, rhymes, and production.","I agree with the few who say that the first six or so tracks are off the hook. The album as a whole could've had some more consistency. ""Fallin' Up"" is the best track. The interludes are humorous but need to be thrown to the curb."
2,not worthy,"Seeing this cd in the top 50, i had to pop in to see what was up. Flipping through the reviews i could not believe how many positive reviews there were. They simply dont have what it takes to be mentioned in the same breath as Tribe, De la, and the Roots. Their style is not innovative, flows are awkward,lyrics are corny (positive doesn't have to be corny, ala tribe, de la). Like any rapper/vocalist you must have the voice to convey your messages. How many times have you heard someone like Raekwon rap and ask yourself wtf is he rapping about? yet you gotta feel his vibe cuz his voice and flow and the extreme conviction he raps with makes you wanna bob your head. Not that im advocating zero content like 90 percent of the rap crap that comes out these days but you have to have both which is what tribe, de la and roots have. This cd is near coaster material. Their rappers need alot of work in lyrical content and delivery. But at least their beats arent a tota! l bomb."
1,As bad as the food its name is derived from,"Black Eyed Peas have been making a name for themselves by selling to the non-intellectuals, with dumbed down lyrics, lame beats, and annoying vocals. Only in America is this the formula for certain success. Just when you thought that no band could cause an aneurysm more than Gwen Stefani, it looks like Black Eyed Peas has become number one."
5,A musician and fan from Chi-town. You have NO IDEA!,"If you like live music with excellent musicianship and body grabbing tracks and lyrics, this is the one. You can really tell who their influences are and if you are a hip-hop fan of any kind, you've got to have this album. BEP is no joke. As a musician, I can't do anything else but give it up as well as my group SOULECLIPSE. It looks like the ""ROOTS"" aren't the only ones in the game with this type of style anymore. This is the best album I've bought since the ROOTS."
1,Disappointed,"By other reviews, I thought this cookbook would have simple go to recipes that were fit for a family eating a low-carb diet.I was wrong! The recipes are not simple and they are not recipes that are quick and easy. The items listed are not food items in my cabinet or fridge and can cost way too much to purchase where I live. I totally made an oops! when I bought this book. It's a new item now sitting on my bookshelf collecting dust. This is a cookbook intended for high quality kitchen chefs with a lot of money that can splurge on expensive foods from the store and come home and cook up in a whim... not for a mother of four that LOVES to cook healthy and simply with ingredients affordable for the entire family to enjoy!"
2,New Perspective,"The first thing I looked for in this book was...'bread' with lo/no carbs. The only hint of 'bread' ingredients is with whey protein which is not really a solution. Since this author is also into smoothies and everything else, I wouldn't expect her to be aware of almond flour and the nut bases that do not add flour-type carbs to one's diet. Perhaps she should not spread herself so thin!"
4,Da Vinci Decoded,"I am a huge fan of de Vinci and of the author, Michael Gelb. I'd read this book once before and wanted a copy. Its an inspiring book."
4,Chief O' Brian,This is a pretty good outfit and fits very well on my husband. I would buy this for friends and family members who are Deep Space Nine fans.
5,The tragedy of Leo Frank,This was a tragedy indeed - the hanging of an innocent man for a murder he did not commit. It should be required reading for everyone. The book arrived in perfect condition in a timely manner and I would do business again.
3,Good for a few Chuckles,"I read this little joke book on a plane home from Minnesota. It was good for a few chuckles. It's similar to the ""You Know You're a Redneck If"" jokes that were so popular a few years ago. The main draw back to the jokes is I didn't get a lot of them. I think you probably have to be a Minnesotan or know the state and its people very well to get some of the humor. Nevertheless, it was a good book to pass the time on a plane ride."
4,JVC TH-D50 Good Buy,"Good sound, can not complain for the price. Looks nice. I plugged in my iPod, played CDs, DVDs, Divx, MPEG-4. I am using it with a 57 inch Toshiba projection HDTV via component connection. Works great, lots of functionality.Remote is ok; could be more user friendly. Same for setup and manual."
1,Not really 5-channel,"I'm disappointed that no one previously reviewing this item cared to mention that the 5-channel stereo ONLY works when listening to CDs or watching DVDs on this particular model. If you want to watch cable or satellite TV movies with surround sound and not just 2 channels, you have to get the next model up. It's right there in the convoluted instruction manual."
3,More about uniforms and insignia than about U-boat crews,"An accurate title for this book would have been ""Uniforms and Insignia of German U-Boat Crews"". The book does cover those things in detail, including such colorful but operationally irrelevant things as edged weapons. The color plates are very good, and the accompanying captions are excellent. What is missing from the book is any substantive insight into U-boat crews: training, organization of the officers and men, what made the U-boat crews so effective. It is also quite annoying that nowhere in the book are the German naval ranks translated into English. The book has its interesting parts and clearly benefits from the interests of the author but it is incomplete."
2,Grill #20B,"My new grill instruction book not very helpful. Cooked steak for the first time--had a very hard time cleaning the grill. Recipes were not useful to me. I think they should have stated to spray the grill first. After much scraping with the enclosed tool, I found the tool didn't fit the grooves. Needs a more informative instruction book."
4,I use it several times a week...,"I keep finding new things to do on this grill. It cooks things quicker than the backyard BBQ since it cooks on both sides at the same time, and it all tastes great!You'll need to learn the ins and outs of timing to avoid overdone food. Check frequently until you are used to it.Be careful when cooking more than one item. If the items are not the same thickness, then the thinner one will cook more slowly since the top burner will not make good contact."
2,YOU'RE PAYING FOR A LOT OF HYPE WITH THIS GRILL!,"HAVING A CHOLESTEROL PROBLEM, I BOUGHT INTO THE INFOMERCIAL HYPE ABOUT THE FAT-DRAINING FEATURE. ONLY VERY FEW DROPS DRAINS. IN FACT, BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS GRILL, AFTER COOKING I WOULD PRESS THE MEAT BETWEEN PAPER TOWELS TO GET THE FAT OUT. THIS WORKS FINE. NOW I FIND MYSELF DOING THE SAME THING AFTER USING GEORGE FOREMAN GRILL. I DEFINIELY DID NOT GET ALL THE FEATURES I PAID FOR. ALSO, CLEAN UP IS NOT ALL THAT EASY."
2,"Charges great, reception poor","I purchased this so I can take all my tunes with me, like everyone wants to. In my area, it's hard to find a ""clear"" FM station unless its at the extreme lower end of the band, (88.*, 89.*) The tuner does not have the capacity or capability to tune below 90.*, therefore, in my area at least, reception really stinks. FM stations still come in loud and clear, but very disappointed of the performance of this product.....but it does charge great. (So what....)"
1,"Don't buy this product, lasted less than 2 months!!!","It seemed like the answer I was looking for but it just stopped working after just 6 weeks. Buyer beware, not a good product!!!!!"
2,Works well until it doesn't,"This worked fine for the first month and a half. Then the charger quit working. The transmitter still works which is kind of mysterious. It was never out of the car and the device is intact and to all appearances undamaged (no loose parts or frayed wires.) I'm guessing something shorted out. It died about 2 weeks too late for me to send it back. Pretty unhappy about this since it cost $35.The transmitter part worked better than a Griffin device I had and returned around the same time; that is to say, much better job cutting out the FM signal. Alas, the charger is really kind of important so I'll have to buy another one after I do some research. The preset option is a slight hassle to mess with also when you are driving-since you can change the presets anyways, why not just add straightforward channel up and down buttons to eliminate the extra step?Be leery."
3,"ok,but not a charger","I purchased this adapter when I purchased my i-pod nano. It says on the description that it is a charger, but when I first used it, on my nano screen it said not compatible to charge with. If I had known this no way would I have purchased this. It works pretty good for listening in your car, but don't buy if you want a charger."
3,It's just okay,"I don't know if I would purchase again, it just works okay. And it won't charge my IPOD 5th Gen Nano. If you have to have something then buy it otherwise I wouldn't..."
2,Not worth a buy,"The radio receiving is not a good idea, whatever the band freq. you set, there's still interference, especially while tall buildings around. Definitely hate this product"
1,"Easy to use, but still a poor product","Very easy to use. If that were the only criteria I was assessing, my rating would be much higher - However, that is not the case. I NEVER was able to establish a clear audio transmission. No matter the location or the station, the audio was always weak and fuzzy. The only thing that differed was just how weak and fuzzy the output. Save your $$$ and look for another solution."
1,VERY Poor Reception on Every Station,"The first one I purchased melted when I plugged it into my car outlet. I then exchanged it for another. No matter what station I tuned it into, there was always static, even on the stations that are normally the clearest in our area. I do not recommed this at all."
1,Fried,I used this product twice. Second time I smelled smoke and sure enough it's fried. It still works as a charger but a little expensive for a charger.
2,ok but not ok,bought it to use with my iphone but the housing is so big I had to take the phone out of the case everytime I used it sent it back and got the garmin road trip works great.
5,Awesome!,"Absolutely awesome product, easy to set up, great sound quality. Have an iPod? Get one of these!!!"
1,disappointed,"does not charge device while playing, wasn't clear in product description that it didn't charge the device while playing in the car"
3,"Works well, but does not charge the Nano 4th","The specs for this item is inaccurate. I contacted Monstercable.com directly and they say there is another model out Version 2 that is compatible with charging the battery for the Nano 4th Generation.I received this item just yesterday and was excited to start using it. It actually plays the music and clear enough with a slight static. But as soon as I plugged it into my nano, it said the charger was not compatible.The version 2 model does not seem to be available anywhere right now except directly from monstercable.com. But it's like $[...]!!!!"
4,Best of fm transmitters,"FM transmission is an imperfect way to listen to music in the car. I have been through several other brands over the years. This is one of the better devices. Does not work with iPhone, just iPods. I opted to have Best Buy install a direct connection for $150 instead of fussing with finding clear stations."
1,Worst Transmitter I have Used! DO NOT BUY!,"This is the worst transmitter I have ever used. There is constant static even when the station I am programmed to has no other signal. If it moves even in the slightest the static increases for whatever reason. Before this product I used an old iTrip transmitter which I had for 7-8 years now on almost a daily basis until the prongs on the phone/ipod plug-in went bad and it had perfect clear signal on the same stations the monster transmitter has static. Even when there was another signal faintly coming through the iTrip was clear. I'm not sure whether the monster transmitter is just under-powered or just of poor quality, but I could not be more dissatisfied with my purchase."
1,Very Staticy,"This thing is a waste of money. Technically it plays your iPod song on only one channel, but with a lot of static. Don't waste your money!"
5,Go Monster!!,This product works great! I've had a Monster car player/charger before that I broke. I tried a Belkin product as a replacement and can't imagine a crappier product. Then I bought this ipod player/charger and it's been working great!
2,Static,"It works ok, about half of the time. Even with the option of 3 different radio stations I get plenty of static. I wouldn't recommend this product."
3,Monster ipod adapter,"When I ordered this , It says that it's a charcer for my kind of ipod. And no it's not. It works well, but bought it to be a car charger too."
4,monster icarplay,Great consept without all the wireing to tap into the f.m. reception. We have to change the station in town it get's fuzzy. Overal it work's great.
3,GREAT DEVICE BUT NEEDS BETTER DESCRIPTION,Product does work but my IPOD is a 4th Generation and this doesn't charge the IPOD while listening. I called and can obtain a replacement but don't want the hassle. Please be sure to cross-reference the type of IPOD you have to ensure compatability. Thanks!
1,Worst FM transmitter,This product barely did what it was advertised to do. It didn't charge and the FM transmitter was shaky at best. Not worth buying at all. Wish I hadn't wasted my time with it.
4,Monster iCarPlay Worth a Try,"From what I have read and have experienced, you should not expect audio as rich and strong as a strong FM station or CD from any FM transmitter. That being said, I am very satisfied with this product after a month or so of use - ease of use, price, and quality. The sound has less depth and strength as a direct connection or FM station, but is more than adequate if you want to leverage your iPod to bring your whole audio library into your car. It's easier than fumbling around with all of your CDs."
1,Worthless,"The unit will NOT work with a current 3G iTouch. It says ""unit not allowed to charge from this device"". Sigh. Sending it back."
4,Good little product,"Worked well and sound quite acceptable. Would be good if they allowed ""even number"" FM stations - only odd number frequencies available but doesn't seem to be a serious problem. Also the dock connection could have been more like the standard Apple connector and would have more easily fit through my iPod case. However, these are minor reservations and overall I found this to be good value for the money."
3,Monster car player,"this unit state's that it will play and charge my i/pod.Yes it work with playing the music, but it will not charge my I/Touch."
1,Waste of money if you know QUALITY !,"I have to rate this a 2 on a scale of 1-10. I needed this device for my new 2008 Porsche. I heard and read good things so I gave it a try. Bottom line, it is very low quality for sound. I have a major sound system in my Porsche. The sound quality through this device sounds like two cans and a wire in between. By the way I also screamed at Porsche for not having an AUX plug in for Ipods. Porsche has made this a standard feature in 09 models. So if you need to have a IPOD hookup and your use to top quality sound. This will be a major let down.If it was not such a bother, I would return it.Happy Holiday Season.Unhappy customer..."
5,Amazing I love this product!,"This product is a joy to use. Can operate on most odd stations, I have even gotten it to work on a station that is actually a radio station!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM,"The first one I got was out of order and I had to return it. The replacement lasted only 2 months since it broke into pieces. On top of that, the receiver was so weak that every certain miles I had to reset it - while driving. The connector to the ipod is probably the least user-friendly connector I've seen. I bought it because I've had execellent experience with Monster products in the past, but truly, I cannot believe how bad qaulity this product is."
4,I bought this as a birthday present and they loved it!,"this is a great device that anyone should have it you have an ipod, its especailly essential for long car trips. it charges your ipod as you use it and its easier to use then some of the other products like it because you can move it around and it isnt in the way of the gear shift."
3,Does what it says,"This does what I expected it to do. It plays music via a radio frequency. I like the fact that you don't have to tinker with the volume on the ipod, it doesn't matter if the volume is up or down on the ipod as you control it on the radio. I wish there was a normal scan button without having to preset stations. As I move around town I always have to scan new stations and preset them. The reception is ok althugh I have to hand the cord around my mirror to get the best reception. Overal it's good for the price."
4,over all good,The Monster IcarPlay works well over all. If you live in a city you may have to change the channel to fine an empty frequency.
4,Pretty Happy,"I have owned this product for about 2 years. I think it is easy to use. Of course if you are driving long distances you will likely have to change the station. I don't find this to be a big deal. I have used it in a Mazda 3, a Chevy van with a crappy receiver, a VW Jetta, Ford Explorer (my mom's- and she can use it) and now a Mercury Mountaineer. My Mountaineer does not even have an antenna at the moment and it works perfectly. It charges my iPod, other people have used theirs with no trouble too. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the volume (not the sound quality) is not as good as when it is directly plugged into a stereo with an actual cable. But, no product could do that and the cable won't charge it. I have been VERY happy and the money was well spent."
2,Bought 2 and one is dead within a month!,We have 4 of these in our family. Three are working fine but one died within a month. Had rated this 5 stars but not now.
5,very good,"Monitor works well, just took a while to warm and work. Was worried at first but all is well now Happy now!"
1,Made up by idiot.,Who ever thinks Malcolm X was negative is not getting the information farther of what they know. Bruce Perry is stupid!
3,good service,received the item propmptly. Quite a fun book with clever ideas. not quite as useful as i had hoped.
2,Don't bother,"I'm a huge fan of chic DIY projects and was very excited about this book. For $25 I learned: 1. How to turn containers for stuff into.... containers for other stuff! 2. Stacking things (and maybe if you feel like it gluing them together) = instant furniture! 3. For just $125.00 and hours of labor I can have a shoddily constructed and unattractive shelving unit! Lacking a chair? All you need is saran wrap (about $3) and a chair!Filled with fluff and ironic hipster commentary, there isn't one thing in this book I would be proud to say I had created. well-intentioned but ultimately a huge disappointment and complete waste of money."
5,Great Purchase,"I have always loved the taste of coffee from a perculator but hated not having a timer on them. I bought drip coffee makers for that purpose only. The problem with drip coffee is it doesn't have the flavor perked coffee has and, with my hard water, I was having to buy a new one every 3 months. The Farberware 12 cup cordless has solved my dilema. It has worked very well so far and I have my perked coffee flavor back."
4,makes great coffee,"I really enjoy the good tasting,hot coffee this percolator makes. I wish,however that it had a signal light for when the timer is set and also that the icons for such were bigger. I would highly recommend this percolator."
2,"Coffee flavor good, product durability poor","I expect a lot more than a year of service for this much money! Coffee flavor was good, but the product lasted only a year. Extremely poor value for the money. Don't by this product unless money is no object!! I read similar reviews prior to purchasing, but dismissed them as isolated cases - MY MISTAKE!!!"
1,Didn't last long,This pot made great coffee for awhile. A little over a year in fact. HOWEVER - The plastic perk top broke - FARBERWARE would never replace the top so Husband fixed it. Then it started taking a very long time to perk which then led to lukewarm coffee. If you want a coffee pot that lasts a long time DO NOT purchase this one.
1,Broke after 1 year,"This thing worked great, like a charm and kept the coffee nice and hot. But then after less than a year, about 8 months, it broke. Something with the electric internals of the base, causes the thing to emit a continuous loud constant beep. Past the manufacturer warranty so this got tossed in the garbage."
2,Great while it lasted,I thought we finally had the perfect coffee maker.Altough it made great coffee it did not make a year. Oh well still looking!!!
3,"Great taste, though it doesn't last...","I bought this unit about 2 years ago, when it was just introduced, and I loved it. Great coffee! And what better than a cordless perc!But, I realised that after about 1 year, it would not heat as it did new. The element on the base and perc are not well protected, even when being the most cautious while washing.Then, just 3 weeks ago I was removing the top and the handle broke off. Now this unit, because there are no replacements available, is completely useless.Maybe next time a manufacturer will think to include a metal piece attached to a metal piece rather than plastic attached to metal. It would last longer! Or, is that the point!"
4,Great Percolator!,This percolator made an excellent cup of coffee! It kept the coffee hot and did not burn it. I made 3 to 4 pots a day on average and did not treat this pot kindly. It lasted 4 years! Too bad it is not still available. I would recommend it.
1,Its got some problems.,"Let's see I bought this from Amazon October 2001. First the clear plastic Percolator top melted off so Faberware had no problem replacing it with a whole new style top. Then a few months later the coffee pot stopped getting hot the coffee was luke warm. So I sent the coffee pot back and recieved a new one, no questions asked. Used it about a month and it went to luke warm coffee. My advice DON'T BUY THE CORDLESS ONE!!!"
4,Farberware Cordless Percolator Not Quite Hot Enough,"If you like your coffee hot, really hot when poured from the pot, stick with Farberware but stick with the percolator with a cord attached to it. This cordless percolator did not keep the coffee as hot as I like, but the corded Farberware percolator did. This is a beautiful appliance and perhaps it will make coffee hot enough for most; but not for me. I had to return it and go with the 8-cup corded model. I wanted the 12 cup but it does not come in a corded model."
1,Tired of buying these things!,"Yes I should not have sprung for the 3rd one but I love the coffee. The first two were the older models that you plugged in and left on. Number One lasted under two years, and Number Two lasted just over a year. I figured that this new version with the base would be the ticket. Well, a month ago the see-through plastic top popped off. Luckily I had learned my lesson and kept various of the other parts to the other two models. So I pulled out the top from the last one and was ready to go. A week ago it started making lukewarm coffee, and then as the week went on, it stopped heating enough to even make coffee. We are using a bodum teapot to make our coffee until the french press coffee pot I ordered arrives. My husband and I have agreed, no Farberware products will ever enter our home again."
1,Bad for tea and it will leave a bad taste in your mouth.,"I have used a classic electric percolator to brew tea for years. I bought this product with the hope that I could have a piping hot cup o' tea as soon as I got out of bed in the morning. The biggest drawback of this percolator is that there is no way to set the perk time. It only perks until the water reaches boiling and then stops, where my old percolator would perk until you unplugged it or it boiled dry. When making tea, it's imperative that water continue to flow for three to ten minutes, depending on the tea leaf blend, after reaching a boiling temperature for optimal flavor and richness.The other problem I had with this percolator is that no matter how many times I cleaned it out with vinegar or soap and water, there was always a hint of plastic/new electronics flavor added to my tea. This can't improve the flavor of coffee either.Avoid this product!"
1,This is quite possibly the worst album I have ever heard,"I think this was the first time it was ever torture to listen to an entire album. This isn't even derivative - it's like derivative of derivative of derivative. As good as the Beatles - you have GOT to be kidding me. At least if I knew these guys were not serious (like the Rutles), I could have laughed."
4,Good. Speedy Delivery.,"Good, delivery was made 20 days before scheduled. Cover a little bit weared if there is any problem."
3,The Monument,"The Monument was a great book if you like art. It gives you the feel for what other artists like to draw and how they draw.It all starts when Rocky meets the person who is deciding on the Monument. The artist, Mick, helps her find that she likes to draw and there is no right or wrong way to draw. Even though Mick might not draw the most enjoyable pictures, he still makes the town have a great monument that represents what the town's centerpiece.I recommend this book for people who want to be artistic and people who really want to learn about art. Find out what Mick does for a Monument and more about Rocky's life in The Monument."
4,Very sturdy and good quality for the price!,I purchased this set of flatware because I needed extra settings. It's much heavier than my previous Oneida set. I really like it. The only thing is you need to be careful not to let it stay in the dishwasher overnight if it's wet. I did and found a little area of one of the knives starting to rust. I wiped it immediately and it looked fine. All in all a good value.
5,Over seven years of use and no problems,"I purchased the Mooncrest setting set over 7 years ago. I was intitally draw to selecting it due to the simplicity design and heavy duty feel and weight. Now as my young ones are no longer using the ""toddler"" silverware I find I need an additional 8 place setting as it seems they are always in the dishwasher. Yes 7 years of use has taken some toll, their finish has been pretty roughed up but no knicks, or bends (they are pretty strong), and I have never seen rust on any of my pieces. A good value that I am confident will last my family even when my grandchildren come visit (20+ more years)."
2,Beware of glaring reviews,"I bought this set based on the glaring reviews in here. As soon as I received I put them in the dishwasher. I guess that's all it took, but a few pieces were RUSTED when I was going to transfer them from the dishwasher to the silverware drawer. Obviously this might be a one-off production glitch; however, I'm simply amazed at the vast number of 5 star reviews. Of the pieces that didn't rust, about half lost their luster and polishing -- again after ONE wash. Five stars? Really? After all it clearly advertises it is DISHWASHER SAFE and STAINLESS STEEL, in my case I got none. Absolutely unacceptable."
5,Great flatware,"I was really impressed with the simplicity of the line and design of this flatware. I'm kind of a plain and classic girl--and this set fits the bill. They are well balanced and have a nice heft to them. Most importantly, they are shaped and sized well. I had a terrible time finding a set that wasn't designed for someone with a really big mouth. These are nice. Long tines on the forks--not stubby.I'm groing to try and remember to come back and update in a few months to report on whether I end up with rusting isssues. I've had them for about 2weeks so far with no problems."
3,Nice stereo but one significant complaint...,"Sounds great through my 1200W system. I've had it for about a year, one big flaw is in the ipod interface. Every time you shut the car off you lose your spot. When you start the car it takes you to the beginning of the first track on the ipod. Irritating. To avoid this you have to unplug the thing before you turn off/on the car. I heard there is a newer ipod connector box XA-120IP from Sony that might take care of this but I'm not too interested in trying it. I'd rather go towards something like the Alpine iDA-X100 that has a fantastic iPod interface (though the lack of a built in equalizer is glaring, always something...)"
2,Needs more self-care information,"This book is written from a medical slant and although it's very good at doing that, it lacks specifics of what women can do to make their menopause a positive experience. As Host of Bellaonline's menopause web site, I hear from women every day asking how to reduce hot flashes without taking hormones, whether they should use black cohosh, what they should eat, and a million other questions. I wish this book would have provided more specific self-care information by asking menopausal women what they found useful."
1,Worst episode EVER!,This was by far the worst episode of this show. The first 10 minutes were dominated by the boring Howard and his sister Bonnie Stern......If You think Anna's cousin Shelly was a trainwreck.......check out these two together on tv....Keep these people off tv please!!!!!!!!! Talk about total trainwrecks!! However it was amusing to see Anna babysit and work at the cafe this didn't redeem the mess Howard and his repulsive sister made of the first 10 minutes...
5,Tragically Beautiful,"Anna Nicole left us with one of the funniest reality shows ever. She admits in one commentary that it wasn't so ""real."" I miss her and love the DVD set."
1,WORST EVER!,"Wow E! must have the best editors in the world! I must have REALLY forgotten what the show was like, but i do remember liking it. However the DVD version is soo slow and there are many, many scenes where no one has anything to say to each other. Not the fun show i remember at all. Bobby Trendy is actually the funny one here. Anna is beautiful and fun and Howard is like the guy you can't stand but can't get rid of. Is he really an attorney? wow"
2,Questionable,I found this book to be somewhat over priced for the information that it offered. The author takes the basic wisdom of the Cowboy and in a typical city fashion finds a way to squeeze a buck. I am a little embarrassed to be be taken in on this one. Beautiful clear photos and illustrations.
3,"fun, but too many buttons!!","My son liked playing with the controller, but it was too many buttons to push, to really figure out what buttons to push to do the right thing."
1,Hard to tell fact from fiction,"This is an abridged and much cheaper version of Bomhard & Kerns' 1994 book ""The Nostratic Macrofamily : A Study in Distant Linguistic Relationship"". In particular, the ""Comparative Vocabulary"" of 523 pages has been reduced to 63 by removing all attested reflexes and listing only the reconstructed proto-forms for each language family. This, however, deprives the book of any practical interest it might have had, because the validity or not of any alleged proto-form can only be judged with an eye on the attested words of the daughter languages on the basis of which it has been hypothesized. In short, readers are given no indication as to whether they are reading fact of fiction, In addition, Bomhard's method is at best controversial; his assertion that chance resemblances between languages ""seldom add up to more than a handful of examples"" (17) is severly mistaken. See review by Sidwell in Diachronica 15, 341-348 (1998)."
1,"ordered a month ago, haven't recieved yet",I would have loved to review the item if i had received it. I ordered it for my Mom over a month ago. My mom's English course will be over before this book arrives. I guess that's my review...
2,wish it was more realistic,"the movie was ok till the end. no one with an eating disorder just accepts recovery so easily. it takes months, if not years to deal with an eating disorder. it was as if andie was dying one moment, then the next month eating a whole meal. gives the viewer the wrong idea of the eating disorder healing process. very unrealistic."
2,inherent flaws in dual alarms,"works well as a clock, but depend on the dual alarm feature to help you get up in the morning? HAH!i have returned my clock to target 3 times to get it replaced. don't depend on your snooze button to work, because it simply turns the alarm off. this was a defect i found after about a month of using the clock. it used to let you snooze for about 7 minutes, but after a while, the snooze feature simply stopped working. i thought it was because i set the second alarm within 1 hour of the first. not true.and i called emerson customer service to inquire about it. their service was awful and they wanted me to pay shipping to send it back to them for replacement! not likely to find anyone paying $9 shipping on a $13 clock.i'm returning mine to target and replacing it with a $17 brand from sony.i can't afford to depend on this emerson clock to let me snooze any more! i would have been better off to set 2 separate clocks at my bedside!"
2,almost,"This is almost a good alarm clock. Everything seems to function as it should with one severe glitch. The button that turns on the radio (and deactivates the alarm) is nestled in the horseshoe-shaped snooze button. If you clumsily slap the snooze button as I do, you will inadvertently turn off the alarm completely. Finally, this one's going back."
1,bad snooze,so far I havent' had troouble with the dual alarm feature - probalem is... snooze doesn't work. danger!!
2,Its okay but weres my radio station?,This clock/radio works great! O wait i was supposed to wake up three hours ago! I HATE THIS CLOCK/RADIO! I cant even get my favorite radio station on it. Its not like its because its were i live cause my stero gets my radio station but this stupid clock radio does not.
3,Good book from a GREAT man and public speaker,"Both a doctor and a lawyer, the brilliant Dr. Cyril Wecht gives us a good, if not too brilliant, book about JFK and various other murders and strange deaths. It is a shame that Wecht's books fail to capture his true essence, because he is not only a very intelligent, brilliant (there's that word again!) man, but he is a dynamic, charismatic public speaker. Something just seems to gets lost on the printed page. Still, worth your time.Vince PalamaraPittsburgh, PA (presented with Dr. Wecht at COPA 1995 & 1996)"
2,If it worked it would be great.,"I purchased this model in March, not from Amazon.com. The design is great but it wouldn't heat the milk to boiling which it must do to kill an enzyme that the human body cannot digest. It took almost exactly 1 month to get a replacement from Salton, the manufacturer. The replacement had the same defect as the original model. I gave up and now put the milk in a pan and boil it, which defeats much of the purpose of the machine."
1,how to avoid forming up to trigger the alarm,"I have similar experience with a reviewer, Spectrum from Flint, MI. I filled the water right on the min mark. But no matter how little soaked soybean I put in the basket, it foamed up in few seconds. Even unluckier than Spectrum, it's never stopped screaming until I decided to quit. Any clue? Did I do any thing wrong here?"
3,Who knows what's going on? I've seen it twice and I'm not sure I do.,"I've seen it twice now and I still can't decide If It's great or terrible. The fights are ok, a little silly but fairly realistic. The story though is where the whole thing turns sour, or is just hilarious. Basically the first 4 episodes flow pretty normally and that's fine, but the last episode comes out of nowhere and essentially has nothing to do with the rest of the story at all. It's like ordering chicken at a restaurant and getting a leather jacket."
4,An essential tool.,"I have just begun learning(??) the guitar. Obviously, strings will go out of tune readily and I have no other way to set/recheck the tuning. This device is simple and intuitive to use, even for a beginner. I can't imagine how any musician could be without such a device and, for the money, why would they?Minor issue: The LCD ""needle"" display will sometimes hold the indication well after ( 3 or 4 seconds) an audible tone is gone. Maybe there's an adjustment I need to find.Recommeded.Therck"
3,"Mostly ok, but....","For the most part, this tuner works fine. But it has a few eccentricities that I find absolutely maddening. Numerous times this Korg has turned itself on in my gig bag and re-calibrated itself and I haven't caught it because the lighting is often poor and it has no back light. It is not a pleasant experience to get on stage, start to play and realize your band is at 440 and you are at 438 or 444. On a few occasions, I've also had it decide my autoharp is a step or two out of tune, and after tuning up, once again find I am way out of tune. So I've reached a point I will only use this in bright light and have back up tuners. I did like that I could plug it in. If I could find a tough clip on with a backlight on that would plug in... that would be perfect."
1,Viet Nam knockoff,I purchased this item in October 2008 but never tried it until recently. It was defective. The red/green tuning lights did not come on and only 2 frequencies sounded. I took it to a music store who pointed out that the Viet Nam sticker was not on their stock tuners.I tried to return it but the return time window had expired.I would give it no stars if that were possible.
5,One of their strongest early discs,"Strangeitude is an essential Ozrics disc. Aside from containing one of their concert dance staples, ""Sploosh,"" this disc boasts a wide, innovative range of space-rock compositions that really show how unique their sensibilities were as a band in their first incarnation. Joie Hinton and Ed Gwynn made a fabulously talented dual-leader combo in this first Ozrics lineup and this disc, along with Jurassic Shift and Erpland, form part of an incredibly productive and consistently excellent body of work. Highly listenable, challenging, and resistant to the formulaic prog-rock sensibility."
2,Not the best Ozric album...,"It has often been said that the Ozrics tend to keep playing in the same style each album. I have often argued long and loudly that this isn't any more true for the Ozrics than it is for any other prog/psych band. But on Arborescence, the last album by the original lineup, this generalization pretty much holds, as the band hit a creative wall, and the results aren't very pretty. The arrangements are often awkward, the performances tepid, the energy rather lacking, at least as compared to most of their other releases. If you are a first-time buyer I would recommend Erpland or one of the more recent albums (Curious Corn or Hidden Step for starters), as this album will (alas) confirm all the bad things you might have heard about the Ozrics."
3,Eden Rose - 'On The Way To Eden' (Lion Produtions),"Originally released in 1969, as this was the French progressive / instrumental band's sole record. Couple of tunes I thought were worth mentioning are the opening title track ""On The Way To Eden"", ""Sad Dream"", ""Feeling In The Living"" and the Procol Harum-like ""Under The Sun"". Line-up: Jean-Pierre Alarcen - guitar, Christian Clairefond - bass, Henri Garella - keyboards and Michel Jullien - drums. Band's influences were notably Procol Harum and Savoy Brown. Not a bad CD reissue, simply not my thing. Might appeal to fans of Soft Machine and Sandrose."
1,Easy to break,I bought this for the second time because it is cheap. The problem is that the two plastic anchors that latch to the notches in the phone easily breaks apart just by usual usage. I thought all I needed to do for this product is to be careful in inserting the connection to the phone. I did that and it still broke. I don't have a car charger anymore.Waste of money.
2,Disappointed,A friend of mine loves this book and reads it again periodically so I looked for it at the library but it wasn't available - which should have been a clue - but I bought it. I was disappointed. It's an easy read but nothing ever happens. I expect her to have an affair or something but she spends a year analyzing herself and her life and then she gets back together with her husband. I felt it was anti-climactic.
1,Don't support this writer by buying this piece of trash,"A friend recommended this book which I unfortunately bought. I feel sorry for people who think that this is ""writing."" The author not only contradicts herself but the writing is shallow and lacks any depth. If you want to feel good, buy yourself a bottle of wine, not this book."
4,A beautifully written book (autobiographical maybe? ),"This short, easy to read book jumped out at me at the local library, possibly because of its fashionably small size. The story inside is definitely not small in any way! Joan Anderson tells an emotionally-captivating tale of a very self-conscious woman who suffers from low self-esteem. Her kids are grown, her husband boring. The story that evolves touches even the inner pinings of me--a happily-married 28-year old with no children. I think every giving wife and mother feels the way Joan does, yet the vast majority never have the guts to make the life-changing decision she did. Those of us without her resolve can live vicariously through her, and it's still a wonderful, worthwhile journey."
1,Give me a break,"Joan Anderson needs to spend some time volunteering for people who have real problems. I read this trite book in two days because I kept hoping there would be something, anything, that I could find likable about this woman. It doesn't take ""courage"" to go to your beach cottage for a year. She is a pampered & priveleged upper class woman who has too much time on her hands. The one redeeming thing I can say is that it made me thankful for my working class Mother who met challenges with grace, strength and humor. She was always aware of our blessings...even when things seemed difficult. Creating a strong family, service to others, taking time off when you need it, perseverance...these are praise-worthy qualities. Joan spent a whole year at the sea and still doesn't get it."
3,Vacation from Marriage?,"Ms. Anderson does what many of us dream of doing: taking an independent vacation from a lifeless marriage. But most of us dont have the luxury of having a home by the sea where we can escape.Even so, I admired her moxie in stretching out toward independence, and in trying to ""unstifle"" her emotions. She describes what many of us think, in our heart-of-hearts.As a woman who divorced after a very long marriage, I could relate to much of her thoughts. I didnt like the ending, though."
5,Great product for busy mornings,"I was one of those people who thought at first this was a dumb idea for an appliance, but reading the reviews I thought I'd give it a try. I've been using it a week now and it's definitely a winner! Cooks perfectly every time, very well thought out. I haven't tried the poacher yet but the medium eggs are great (white cooked, yolk soft). The egg holder tray is a bit tricky to clean but I give the product 5 stars. It's a permanent fixture in the morning routine and it has a very small footprint which is great for compact urban apartment living. Timer works well and is loud enough to hear from the next room. Easy to carry the eggs to the sink to run under cold water."
5,Withdrawal symptoms due to no Salton egg cooker,"I am currently using my Salton egg cooker, which is at least 7-8 years old, and still does a beautiful job, despite the rack starting to crumble after so much use. I wanted to order another just like it, but to no avail, since it is out of stock, and can't find one like it. It's still functional, everything works; just can't find one like it..."
1,Typical Socialistic Rhetoric,"Basically a conspiracy theory, McQuiag believes that the corporate power brokers have manipulated the Canadian government to profit. Despite the fact that the government is half the problem in letting go along with the plan, McQuiag blames almost all the problems on solely on free enterpriseShort-shorted, poorly researched, and lacking any real economic insight, this book is of little value to a person who knows basic economic principles.A worthless plea for government intervention into all aspect of human life."
4,A pretty good Nuun,"This review is just for the Kona Cola flavor.My wife and I love Nuun, and use them when working out or just when we want something refreshing to drink. The Kona tablets are pretty good - the cola flavor is mild but authentic, and it has just a bit of sweetness. It's also one of two Nuun tabs that have caffeine, the other being an Arnold Palmer flavor that I have not had, but have read is not as good. The 20mg of caffeine is not a lot (according to the Mayo Clinic's website, an 8 oz serving of coffee is 100-200mg), but that little bit of boost can help with a long workout.The cola flavor DOES turn your drink light brown. It also, for whatever reason, takes a LOT longer to dissolve than other flavors. I've tested this side by side: lame for sure, but wanted to be sure I wasn't crazy.Top flavors of Nuun are Strawberry Lemonade and Triberry. I'd call this a Tier 2 flavor. If you go through as much Nuun as we do, get if for the variety and the caffeine."
2,Avoid if sensitive to MSG,"I guess as a hydration supplement it does what it says. Taste is average. Unfortunately, they have put MSG (probably listed as ""natural flavoring"" in the ingredients). For me, that leads to a migraine headache when combined with exercise. I use CamelBak Elixir with no problems and it tastes pretty good, too."
1,Hypocritical,"This book consists entirely of articles this author wrote for (then recycled from) Rolling Stone, so if you may have read all of these articles/chapters already.I picked it up thinking it would be an interesting study on fringe religious groups. Instead, the author interviews the religious leaders then stabs them in the back by defamating them. Take the Anton LaVey article, for example. The author claims LaVey's name was fake, he was not born where he claimed, he never met Marilyn Monroe, he never slept with Jayne Mansfield, etc. Yet he provides absolutley no evidence of this. Just word of mouth. Yet to this day many people believe Mr. LaVey did indeed live a lie. It's interesting that most people who read the article never question this.Mr. Wright is no better than the people he supposedly exposes, and is at least as hypocritical. His lack of evidence severely taints his credibility."
5,Favorite tea,"Love this herbal tea... it's mellow and flavorful, and I can drink it day after day without getting sick of it."
2,I'm one of the few that don't care for this tea,"After reading the review by ""That Chatty Gal"" I have to agree with her. I really wanted to like this tea. What's better than Madagascar Vanilla and Tea? I love both so this seemed like a wonderful choice. Unfortunately for me, the tea smelled like tobacco (good tobacco if that matters!) but had a syrupy sweet taste and no real depth of flavor. I also tried it with soymilk, honey, sugar, milk, and both cold and iced. Still, I was unable to even drink one cup because I just didn't find this to be a pleasant experience. I used about half of the box trying to make it work, but it didn't.On the other hand, my children really enjoy this tea so I think this is one of the teas that you either love or hate. As for me, I'll stick with Celestial Seasonings Chai teas if I'm in the mood for a sweet tea with milk and sugar."
1,What I imagine dishwater tastes like...,"I love tea. I was so excited to try this, because of health benefits, as well as the supposedly delicious taste. I bought the whole case with the intention of enjoying some myself and giving some as presents. The reviews were so positive, and I thought the vanilla would have to make it wonderful no matter what. But, I was wrong. To my taste, this tea is awful. It's nearly tasteless (which I do not consider a benefit in tea), but what I did taste wasn't very nice. After one cup, I threw away the box I'd opened and put the unopened boxes where people could take them if they wanted. I wouldn't have given it to anyone as a gift."
2,LOOKS STRONG TASTE LIKE VANILLA WATER,I TRIED THE RED BUSH POMENGRANITE AND IT WAS QUITE AWESOME. FULL OF FLAVOR BUT NOT THIS TEA I HAVE PUT TWO BAGS AND LET IT SIT FOR 20 MINUTES AND IT STILL LACKS TASTE ON THE FRONT END. YOU CATCH THE VANILLA ON THE BACK AND IT IS VERY SUBTLE TO THE POINT OF WHERE IS THE TASTE? I AM DRINKING IT AS I WRITE THIS AND STILL FIND THAT RED BUSH TEA HAS VERY LITTLE REAL FLAVOR. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE USED TO BLACK TEA OR EXPRESSO IT WOULD BE A JOKE. I ONLY DRINK HERBAL TEAS BUT I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TRY ANY OTHER FLAVOR. THE BENGAL SPICE AND POMEGRANITE ARE EXCELLENT. I HAVE TO DESCRIBE THE TASTE IS SORT OF A LIGHT TOBACCO TASTE(NOT A SMOKER)WITH VERY MILD VANILLA AND LACKLUSTER FLAT TASTE(PLAIN OR WATER DOWNED) BASE EVEN THOUGH THE COLOR IS DEEP RICH AND RED. I LIKE THE HEALTH BENEFITS AND WILL KEEP BUYING RED BUSH BUT NOT THIS FLAVOR.
5,One of my favorites!,"The Ritz Carlton carries a Roobois Chai tea that tastes very similar to Madagascar Vanilla Red. Add a little cardamon and red chili pepper for a perfect cup of Chai, just add milk and brown sugar!"
3,Okay book,"Although the author is also the founder of Sailrite, better instructions are available at Sailrite's website where you can view the free videos on projects and marine fabrication techniques, including many of those mentioned in the book."
4,pgeidt,"Sorry for taking so long to comment about this delivery. I have always had great service with Amazon orders and am sure this delivery was in the high staandard catagory as they all are. I do remember that the book is in great condition and that it was received within the 10 days promised, but unfortunately I have not ben able to read it. I love Louise Erdrrrich's work so I ordered it to entend my knowlede of Fleur's family."
3,Decent book,"The vendor shipped it so it arrived almost 2 days early which was great because I needed it for class. The story itself was a little odd. It took time to get into, but once you get used to time shifting and perspectives changing, it's a good set of stories."
3,Good Map of Downtown. No Phone Nos.,"It has brief descriptions of restaurants, nightclubs, stores, etc., but gives phone numbers only for museums and the like. Irritating. It wouldn't have been much trouble to add phone numbers and websites.Otherwise, it's fine, if all you are interested in is the downtown Boston-Cambridge area. Fits easily into a pocket."
1,WTF?,Wow. Christians stole another holiday and still don't know what to do with it. Maybe they should pray for my sins on Samhain(Halloween).
4,Good story,"Firstly, I have house rabbits. They are the third most popular pet in the USA. I have become rabbit responsible and researched rabbit care. They are an exotic and this needs to be done before you take on a pet any pet.Like other people a passion sparks the collections. If one likes cats you sometimes collect cat items. My passion is rabbits. I collect rabbit things...like movies. The Christmas Bunny is a good story. I see some flaws...a few things I resent. First the make someone who loves rabbits appear to be a freak or a crazy rabbit person. That is not true. I also see that the boy characters in the movie do something that compromises the safety of the rabbit...AND they are not punished for it or even put straight on what they did and why it was wrong.Overall a good story and a must have for the rabbit caregiver to own for fun."
4,I'm happy,"To be honest, I got this particular table because as I saw it, I was getting 3 tables for a very good price.I'm not ""nesting"" the tables, they're being used in different rooms. Each one is a different size.WARNING: These have to be assembled manually and with each table you must screw in 10 screws-yes 10, that's 30 altogether for all three tables. There are no pre-drilled holes either so you have to pre-hammer your own holes with regular nails before putting in the screws.Besides that, I'm very happy with my tables.Like I said, I got 3 different sized tables at a very good price.I like them and I am happy with my purchase."
4,did what it needs to do,"it worked like a charm , easy deal ////iam happy with the product , got what i asked for, fast shipping,no problems thanks"
1,Disappointed,"I was excited to receive this book, which is considered holy scripture. The package arrived within the time specified, the exterior of the package was in fine shape. The book inside, however, was a different story. This beautiful piece of work has visibly been soaked with (hopefully only) water. Every page is wrinkled and warped, including the front and back covers. This condition was not as originally advertised, and did not occur after the package was sent, as evidenced by the inpeccable condition of the package exterior. I was saddened to see scripture in such condition but will keep it as I feel that my faith and love for it will heal it. It is disgraceful first that this book was damaged in such a way and second that it was sold under false claims. I will likely not use this seller again and will be happy to alert my friends and family of the service, albeit sub-standard, that I received. I would rate zero stars, but must rate at least one to get the review online."
4,His sugar-coated voice makes me feel like he's singing to me,"""Love and Consequences"" is an awesome CD. It includes the song ""Thinkin' About It"" which is very soulful in some ways, the way the music sounds and his voice, too. He has a honey-like way to make you hypnotized with his words. Gerald is a highly talented artist and I recommend this CD to anyone and everyone, no matter if R&B is your thing or not."
1,This edition of the soundtrack should be avoided!,"If you are seeking this soundtrack, the best possible version can be found on iTunes. It's done by the great artist, Peter Thomas and his Sound Orchestra. Its an iTunes exclusive and has scintillating sound quality in comparison to this joke above that sounds like it was dubbed off of a VHS tape. I've long loved the music of this film and I cannot stress how poor the import version above is."
4,The life and death of Bluto,"Bob Woodward's account of the life of John Belushi is an excellent piece of journalism in that it is a quite believable story that is vivid in the telling. Unfortunately, it ultimate is pretty depressing. That an intelligent guy like Belushi could fail to see where he was headed and waste his tremendous talent is good lesson about the hazards of fame. ""Live fast die young and leave a good looking corpse,"" so the quote goes. Belushi wasn't the first or last show-biz star to live his life by that mantra. And his story is probably fairly representative of stars from Jim Morrison to River Phoenix.One note: the book ""Wired"" is far, far superior to the travesty of a movie it later became."
3,Kill some time w/ this.....,"I read 'Wired: The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi' during my summer break, and it really had me hooked. Although it was filled with a lot of 'dry techno-babble' and only focused on the dark side of John, I didn't want to put it down. On the negative side, the author made it seem as if there was NOTHING good about John, when there was everything you could want in a person, which all of those qualities have been stated in the review previous to mine. Like I stated already, I would only read this to kill some time and to gain some rare trivia."
3,"A grafic and shocking tale, that leaves a sad impression.","This tale of excess in the late nights of the 70's and early 80's is not just the story of John Belushi, but of the time period he lived in. And it also shows the inside of Hollywood itself, and as we all know many of the things you read here are still are going on today. But the cold way it is told reminds me of an episode of ""Law and Order"",rather than a life story. However it is thrilling to read about the life in Hollywood at night,and to read the storys of Belushi meeting some of Hollywood's ""A list"" and thier accounts of him. But when the end comes for Belushi and the book, you are left with a bad taste in your mouth."
1,Not for use on carpet,Well my daughter didn't get much use out of this because it was hard to roll on carpet. While it was a cute walker and easy to assemble I found it to be very bulky and hard for her to use. My daughter did enjoy the toys and the animal sounds/songs.
3,"does the job, but the toys do suck","Pros: adjustable levels to match your baby's height, safety brakes, easy to put together, toy aparatus comes off, wheels roll easilyCons: toys suck - they only work if you hit/smack them a certain way; I wish they would turn on just by touch. (I'm glad the toy aparatus comes off, so my daughter can play with other toys or use it as a snack/food tray.)"
3,Digital Copy cannot be redeemed,"The movie is great, but be aware that when I tried to redeem the digital copy (following the instructions on the disk) to be able to watch it on my iPad/iPhone, I got an error message on the Universal website saying that ""sorry, this title is no longer available"". So that means that I paid for something I didn't get. Amazon should lower the sales price and clearly state that this disk is only a Blu-ray disk, and that the digital copy is not included."
4,Decent Adventure Movie,"to be brief and to the point, saving the historical backdrop for other reviewers: this was a good adventure historical flick that was well-cast. Despite the general criticism of Channing Tatum, he was perfect for this part: regal and smoldering. And Jamie Bell was an apt companion - I KNEW I recognized him...just didn't realize he was Billy Elliot! Rent and enjoy."
1,The middle half was so boring!,"I really like watching Roman soldiers, so I was looking forward to seeing this DVD. However, I saw it last night and it was BORING! The first 20 minutes were exciting enough, but then after the commander gets wounded in battle, the next half of the movie is majorly slow and completely uneventful. Instead of rich and exciting battle scenes with lots of soldiers, the story changes to just dumb scene after scene of the wounded commander and his faithful friend slowly riding on horesback around Britain --just the two of them! This middle half of the film was so tedious and devoid of anything interesting, that I turned it off after about 45 minutes. I tried in vain to fast forward through all the slowpoke crap, but it was fruitless, because the weary nothing just went on and on and on!BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!"
5,Excellent!!!,"I will be brief, so not to spoil anything. This movie was great! I was going to wait until I could get it in the ""Red Envelope"" in my mailbox but was glad I went with buying it from Amazon for my Roku player instead. Great story very well written & acted. (PS I do not write a lot of reviews so just doing this is a 5 star nod)"
2,Major Disapointment,"I have to say that I have been a fan of this book since I was 14, I am now 37. Warning major spoiler alert : From the beginning to about Marcus's surgery followed the book decently well. I liked the scenes of the Roman camp life, and Uncle Aquila's house. At this point, the movie went completely astray. The major themes of the book are Marcus trying to figure out what to do with his life, his friendship with Esca, his dream of buying back his family farm, etc. The movie completely ignored the friendship he developed with Esca, as well as Esca's manumission ( being set free). The recovery of the Eagle wasn't a random snatch and grab, it was very carefully planned and executed. I won't even start about the Legion re-assembling."
3,"3.5 rating, if that were possible...","These ancient tunes, sung a capella by the woman of Tetuan, Morocco, are undeniably authentic, yet probably too stark in their rendering to be of interest outside of devoted cultural historians, and the most diehard listeners. It's cool on a folkloric level, but I couldn't listen to it for very long."
3,Movie magic... XXX style,"After reading this book you will never view another adult video the same way.Prior to reading this book, I had no idea how hard actors and actresses work on the set of an adult movie.This book goes in-depth via candid interviews with all the participants involved in the production of ""Stairway to Paradise"". Their individual perspectives on the making of this XXX masterpiece will make you realize how difficult it is to produce a quality ""hard core"" movie."
1,Not Yet Received,"I haven't received the first issue of the magazine I ordered, so I am not in a position to review the product. I'm not expecting anything until the March issue. If I don't get that one (since I ordered before Christmas), then I'll expect some answers. OK for now."
4,For the Electric Guitarist,I've been a subscriber for some time now and I find this magazine to be a great bargain. This magazine/CD combo is a must for the electric guitarist. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that there is too much emphasis on metal for my taste.
3,Eh,"WAYYY too much emphasis on metal, and almost all their big features are about some rock star who's designed a signature amp. Guitar Player is far more inclusive of other styles and they actually focus on the guitar."
3,"Good ol' weird, young Beck","Beck is trying to be very raw and weird on this early cut. The music isn't great or even loveable, but what's interesting is the history. This is kind of for hardcore Beck fans only, otherwise go for Mellow Gold."
1,Packed with lies and anti-Catholic propaganda,"This is the most anti-Catholic film ever produced. Packed with lies from beginning to the end, none of the outrageous claims are ever backed up by any reliable sources."
3,Good for conversational Korean,"I found this book to be good for only conversational Korean. I am currently taking Korean in college and did not find it that useful except for the vocabulary in the back. The book focuses only on informal polite (the -yo form) speech. It does not teach anything on the formal and honorific forms of the language. I was also hoping to find verb conjugations but was disappointed when I found none. If you are planning to buy this book, please note that it focuses on conversational Korean. The book will not help much if you wish to learn formal or honorific Korean."
5,Trail of the Mountain Man,This was purchased for a non-reader who became hooked on the series and now can't stop reading these books. I've read a good portion of it and it really is quite engrossing.
5,Jim Stahl,"I agree with the others that this is the best cookbook on baking that I own. People generally like the baked goods I make from this book. Grandma's date-filled cookies, which I think are pictured on the cover are especially good as is the chocolate and orange cheesecake."
4,Poor quality shipping,I ordered a used copy of this cookbook which I have enjoyed for years. The book was in transit for three weeks but was sent from CA to CT in a flimsy sheet of bubble wrap. The corners of the book and base of the spine are shattered as the corners had pierced the wrapping and there was simply not enough protection for the weight of this book. This is indeed disappointing. It is a shame that a book that started off in fine shape from Fat City Books arrived in such poor shape.
3,An Okay Mix,"The book is nicely made. It separates everything into small units and tries to cover as much as it can.However, it falls short. The Chemistry, Photosynthesis, Mitosis/Meiosis reviews are nice. But the genetics area is too simplistic. It doesn't cover enough or go into enough detail. You're going to have to study that section by yourself.Other than that, it does cover a lot, but since genetics is a large part of the exam, it just doesn't cut it."
1,IT SUCKS,If you took the class like me but had two different teachers and one teacher did not teach you anything then welcome to my world. TO tell you the truth this books sucks. It has almost no imformation and unless you are some genious you would wanna look at this book as a quick review. This book teaches you like you are a third grader. I am taking ap exam in two days and was reading the molecular biology section and it did not cover how enzymes worked; and stuff like that. I also brought an barron's book and was looking at that. It covered everything like you need. Cliffs book sucks and don't buy it; buy something else. It skips a whole lot of stuff. IF you wanna get a 4 or better get another book. THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE.
4,perfect ...except if you're missing chunks,"this was a GREAT book. it covered everything that was on the exam (i just took it this morning haha) and it did not include too much unnecessary information. but this is a REVIEW BOOK... meaning you should not use this to learn the information!! i'll admit that there were a few topics during this school year that didnt actually learn and just ""got by""... so when it came time to review for the AP, i had a few chunks of information missing. The Cliff's review book was not made to teach you this information. if you don't underSTAND a concept, i would advise you to use ""5 steps for a 5"", which is a much easier read. (the only problem with that book alone is that it does not use enough ""standard"" terms)"
5,Best One,"This book basicly carried to a 5 on the AP test. I had the huge Campbell book, read the first chapter and didn't like it. This dislike basicly led me to bury it in my locker, covered by trash and other stuff. With a week left I decided to skim my Cliffs book. All in all, about 4 hours total reading was enough for me to get the 5 (I was in a bio class, so that was probibly worth something, but our teacher was more or less inept so Cliffs notes is basicly really awesome)."
2,Don't expect to get a 5 or even a four from just reading this book,"My son took the AP Biology test last year. He wasn't very studious with his textbook, but he read this book for days. He basically memorized everything inside like the back of his palm. Yet in the end he was only able to get a 3 on the test. Don't trust study guides too much. Basically, my point is that nobody should use this book alone to get a great score on the test; it simply doesn't compare to a textbook when it comes to details. Simply put, there is usually no easy way or shortcuts in life, including the AP biology test."
4,"A lot of fun to listen to, worth having","My first Mediaeval Baebes album was Undrentide, it had a lot of good stuff in it but mixed in some synthesizer sounds, this one is much better. Salva Nos is the Baebes first work and it is a very good album with no modern sounding instrumentation in it at all. Of the 16 tracks only 7 have ANY musical accompaniment, in many of those it is subtly done.I can't say which is my favorite tune but everything has a medieval sound and feel to it, I love the way they got such a good harmony and sound going just with their voices. Singing in 13th to 15th century English or Latin, mostly (lyrics provided in both the original and modern tongue), these women clearly don't need musical instruments.Buy this album for the good music, enjoy it for the lack of intrusive modern sounds."
4,Another good British film about money,"This movie about English currency traders is exciting and intense. If you are a trader and in need of motivation, you should definitely see this movie. What I liked about it was that it showed the ups AND downs of trading, hence a bit of realism. For instance, what is a trader's life like when he is unemployed? It can be grim, as depicted. However, the realism is balanced by a somewhat implausbile scenario where US T-Bills went from 98.00 to 88.00 in less that 10 minutes. I don't think that kind of volatility has ever hit the US bond market. Nonetheless, a great movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. It would have been much better if they showed Rebecca DeMournay naked."
4,Good exposure of the Financial/Stocks trading mean,"Awesome is the beginning of this movie, shedding lightinto corporate Britain. The life of Financial dealersis shown and their breaking point is exposed.Daniel Pascoe, maverick trader, has a difficulttime when his maestro and compadre Robby Barrellis fired off the company. Still he finds how toovercome difficulties. Once problems are over,comes the time to think whether the perilsand stress are worth it...Meeting beautiful Ann Schumann lets him understand what""having all"" means.The music is glorious (and hard to find,unfortunately!)Oh my, I wish this existed on DVD!Something else: Perhaps from the same studio, theyrealized later a tv series on the very same location(I guess the series didn't pay off... and it wasn'thalf the emotion of the movie... that should be thereason why now only low-end government stationsbroadcast the program...)"
4,Good story...,"with interesting characters. I did anticipate something BIG was going to happen but it never did. Other than that, good show laddie!"
3,Disappointing,"I wasn't impressed. It's really too small to be of much use with a lot of adult puzzles. The felt is cheap. If you're looking for a decent puzzle mat, spend a little more and get a larger one. It's worth it."
4,Decent,"As the title states, these are some pretty decent speakers. I put them in my back hatch in a 1993 Chevy Cavalier Wagon. I don't know if they fit with the trim piece back on because I haven't put it back on due to me breaking it when I took it off (DOH!) But they put out some pretty clean mids and highs but they have absolutely ZERO bass. Which is fine if you have a subwoofer to pair it with. Another think I noticed that the passenger side speaker may sound a little weaker. It looks like it has a little less excursion as well but I might just be imagining this. But yes, overall these speakers are pretty good if you have a subwoofer for your bass."
4,ARS 120DX 8-inch Heavy Duty pruners review,"ARS has a good reputation for quality pruners. I had one pair that were the best ever. This new model is not as good as the heavy duty pair that I used to have. It is good for light pruning of roses and bushes but I would not recommend it for canes thicker than 1/2 inch. I am still testing my 120DX model. I wish I could review the pruners in another month to see how I did pruning 1200 rose pushes, 50 fruit trees, and 25 grapevines.A word of caution... Make sure that you buy the pruners directly from Amazon as one of the Amazon Warehouse sellers substituted the cheaper 130 pruners for the real 120DX model."
4,Comfort Diner Cookbook is a classic!,"Wonderful easy to prepare, home-cooked style recipes with delightful 50's style artwork with plenty of helpful tips randomly placed within the 160 pages. The chapter style layout makes it easy to read & the print (font size) is nice sized. I would have rated it 5 STARS, except it contains no pictures of the recipes. Bought one for my daughter-in-law and one for myself! Very satisfied!"
1,Moving story but not insightful,The book narrates a moving story which shows from a personal point of view how difficult it is not to conform to mainstream culture. But it is not insightful about the larger Vaishnava movement in America or in India. For that read Klostermaier's ``Hindu and Christian in Vrindavan'' or his newer ``A Short Introduction to Hinduism.''
4,iskcon truth or silence,"the iskcon movement is about truth and kindness. Simple words as a chant can be powerful tools is achieving goals. This book illustrates an organization grown from fear,drugs and theives. To produce a gentler world is not easy but to work with worst of society and create perfection. But it does happen"
2,broken-hearted,"Other Voices, Other Rooms is so sweet. I bought ""too"" and couldn't be more disappointed. I thought I was a die-hard Griffith fan. Oh well, one stinker out of many greats."
3,self-indulgent,"This was a good CD. It could have been a great CD. A perfect example of why performers should not be allowed to produce their own recordings. Any competent producer could have restrained Nanci from engaging in her most annoying vocal ""stylings"". I kept wanting to scream, ""Just sing the bloody song!"" Her treatment of Stephen Foster's wonderful ""Hard Times"" was particularly shameful."
2,Yet another mediocre offering.,"Having seen Nanci sing songs from Last of the True Believers many years ago in a theatre on a pier jutting into the English Channel with huge waves and a cold wind gusting, I was enchanted. However she now just puts out too many records. Is it the record company or has she big bills to pay? Please Nanci, just pull back a bit, wait and then give us something a bit special."
2,Maybe you didn't make it to song #18,"I agree that this cd isn't as good as the first Other Voices, but to me, that one was a masterpiece. In my opinion, Nanci's versions of Darcy Farrow and He Was A Friend Of Mine on this cd rank right up there with anything on the first Other Voices and alone make it worth the purchase. Hey, it's Nanci. Gotta love her."
1,A terrible disappointment.,"If you liked the first ""Other Voices..."" you might be tempted to buy this sequel without delay. The original was one of the best singer/songwriter albums ever. The follow-up is a dud. Arrangements are bewildering - ""Deportee"" is sung like a barroom anthem, not a wistful lament. I know arrangers and performers are always looking for a fresh way to present older material, but they have gone too far in this overblown attempt to recapture the brilliance of the first ""Other Voices"". I have been a Nanci Griffith fan for years and I will still buy her recordings, but I actually regret having bought this one. In fact, I regret that she even got involved in it. It's really not good, brothers and sisters - not good at all, and it could have been wonderful."
1,Pathetic and Grotesque,"Nancy Griffith and these dust balls of folk music should know when to lay it down. Nothing worse than forced emotion and voices. A concocted mess, an insult to folk music, and a waste of money."
4,DO OR DIE (CHI-TOWN STYLE 2000-01).,"IF YOUL LIKE MIDWEST RAP AND IF YOU LIKE DO OR DIE,THEN BUY THIS ALBUM.IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE ALBUM SUCKS OR NOT IF YOU LIEK THE GROUP THEN IT SOUNDS GOOD TO YOU ANYWAY ""THAT'S MUSIC"".PEOPLE RAP WHAT THEY FEEL SO DON'T GET MAD AT THEM IF A ALBUM SUCKS.TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH THIS IS NOT THE BEST DO OR DIE ALBUM ""HEADZ OR TAILZ"" IS MY FAVORITE,CAUSE THEY TEAR UP BONE THUGS IN 2 STRAIGHT TRACKS.CHI-TOWN STYLEDO or DIE (RAP-A-LOT RECORDS)"
2,Funniest Album I've ever heard!,"This was one of the weakest albums I've ever heard. Don't Do Or Die know without Twista their album just isn't the same?? Po Pimp made their first album, Still Po Pimpin' made their second, and then they come out with this and disrespect his name with this garbage. They obviously need an awakening because without Twista they won't be doing, just dying. Do not buy this album, just dub it or something."
4,This CD Rulez,"This cd plain and simple is bas ass. Victory, MP+T, and VIP all rule on this cd. If you are a true Do Or Die fan, you focus on the lyrics, and realize this cd has alot of power to it."
5,"IF YOU LIKE THIS,TRY,,,","Goldenhorse. Similiar music with soft, but strong female vocals-Kirsten Morrell is lead vocal of Goldenhorse."
3,Same formula,"If you have seen any other Real World You Never Saw DVDs, then you will know what to expect with this DVD. The formula is the same. For those that don't, it's pretty much a collection of outakes that show the cast acting silly. There is no drama here.I give this DVD an average rating because MTV never puts much effort in the DVDs. The short runtime is weak enough, but the special features are always lacking. I was hoping this time they could at least throw in the City High promo songs for this season, but instead we get the same old house tour and cast bio/audition tapes.Like I said, it's average at best."
4,Pretty Good,"This anime has a great dub cast, great art, and awesome opening. The plot really draws you in but it felt a little short. Probably because I had to watch it all at once... lol"
2,crap,"I'd have to say that these are the cheapest flash cards that I've used... After having the baby einstein ones (these thick and aren't flimsy) these just weren't worth the money. I liked how much info was there, but when you have a three year old that you are trying to use them for... well, you get the idea."
1,Difficult to Use,"The plastic laminate that is on one side of the paper causes it to slip in the printer and not pass through like a normal paper. Also, if you do get a sheet to print, it is NOT easy to fold over the laminate to cover the printed part."
2,Not Jeff Beck's best---live or otherwise,"While there are great bootleg recordings of great music (and there are many of Jeff Beck), this is an example of a bad one, that catches him in a less than stellar performance. There are also problems with the sound balance in the club, and on the recording. Beck's playing is powerful, but ragged, raw, and loud, and he overplays on most of the numbers. I strongly encourage all except Jeff Beck completists to bypass this one, and grab the Official Bootleg CD instead, which captures an example of a perfect Jeff Beck concert."
4,wow nice,"If you like the blues even a little bit this cd is really good listening , everyone that has heard this has bought it"
5,'Abdu'l-Baha in Paris,"One of the cental figures of the Baha'i Faith, 'Abdu'l-Baha visited the West between 1911 and 1913. He visited London, Paris, and a number of cities in the United States (April-December 1912). A collection of his addresses given in Paris, Paris Talks gives a comprehensive view of the Baha'i teachings, for example the equality of men and women and the abolition of prejudice."
2,"Not the best Perlman, and definately not the best recording of these capricci","Although I love (almost) all of Perlman's recordings and playing, I was mortified by these caprices. Although he deserves some credit for the speed he takes, the sound quality and intonation is lacking from what I have heard. Almost everything is sharp, and his sound is not focused enough for everything to come out clearly. I would recommend Midori's recording of these over Perlman's, because of a beautiful sound throughout all 24, and almost completely perfect intonation."
4,Good movie,"With all the talk shows around, I really did like this movie. It made the point that the talk shows that hurt people should be responsible and it shows how people can be soooo stupid for watching them!!!"
4,This CD is OK,"I got almost all of No Limit's CD's, and this CD could have been a lot better. I love how these guys flow together. They almost sound the same at some points in their songs. The best songs on here are ""Time After Time"", this song is tight!! Also, ""Soldier Story"", Throw Them Thangs"", Ghetto Day"", and ""Bout That Combat"". Go get this CD!"
1,"I like The Exploited, but hate this release","I guess that's odd, but it's true. I like The Exploited, but the Singles CD, I don't like at all. It may contain their singles but these are not their best songs. Not even close to their best music at all. Avoid this and get Punks Not Dead, On Stage, or Lets Start A War instead."
5,Surprised by Bad Reviews,"My daughter received this as a gift for her 2nd birthday. We have used it so many times, and are still on the first set of batteries. We have left it outside a few times, but for the most part, we keep it indoors. I use the big bottle of bubble solution called Super Miracle Bubbles from Toys R Us to refill it for each use and we get a LOT of bubbles each time it runs. I think the key is not to overfill. The table we sit it on outside is never messy or sticky afterwards. Although, keep in mind that if you move the unit with the bubble solution, you need to keep it very level or the solution will spill out the back vents. I was actually looking this item up to purchase it as a gift my nephew. It has been a HUGE hit at our house with all the kids."
1,Great while it lasted,I purchased this for my granddaughter. This was operated by adults and the 3-4 year old kids had fun playing with the bubbles for about 2-3 hours. Then it never worked again.
4,Ma Yan goes to school,"I read Ma Yan's Diary immediately after watching the opening ceremony for the Olympics. The diary is very moving; Ma Yan shares her experience with the culture of a small Chinese province. Between the lines, her writing explains a lot about the Chinese national pride we are seeing at the Olympics. It explained many questions I had about the way Chinese residents might feel after seeing the excess of the opening ceremony. Excellent view into a young girl's life and the culture she lives in.Highly recommend!"
1,"repetitive,","to quote Oscar Wilde, diaries should be read only by those who write them. While I sympathize with the struggles of Ma Yan to receive an education, the diary is really neither literature or very interesting."
4,Really an interesting read...yet..,"So getting right down to it, Assassin's Apprentice is a great first book in the Farseer Trilogy. It's characters are well thought out and are easy to love..and hate, Robin Hobb has really created a great world of the Six Duchies. The book just naturally draws me in, however, I love everything about this book, but it's just so hard to read. I don't get it myself, one other reviewer said, ""It's physically draining, it's just hard to read it and it will leave you tired."" At first I didn't believe him, but when I was reading it, I found myself FORCING myself to read. Not that I didn't want to read, just it takes something out of you. I don't really quite understand it.It made me tired, not bored. I really do love this book, and it's a great start to one of the most fascinating and emotional Trilogies I have ever read. This book has everything you could want, but it drains you. I do recommend it."
2,great writing,really good writing~but the story is just so inescapably sad. i count wait for a break when something good would finally happen. too sad.
5,great book,"I loved this book, and the whole series. I would recomend this to anyone my age ( Im 13). It is REALLY good, and make sure to read the history part in the begining of the chapters, it explains alot ( opps)"
5,surprisingly good read,I do not normally read fantasy (as I'm a nonfiction sort) but I must say that this was a good read. Not too rediculous with novel ideas to cover up a bad story line.
1,Waste of time and money - don't bother,"This has all the makings of being a great series, but the execution is terrible and this is being nice.I struggled to get through the book and by the end wondered why I bothered.It just leaves me feeling empty and I certainly will not read the rest of the series."
5,Incredibly satisfying character development,"I'll keep this short: If you like character development in a fully realized fantasy world, if you like to go on a roller coaster of emotional identification with the main character, if you want to cry when he fails and shout for joy when he succeeds, if you want to reach the end of a book held in your left hand while your right hand reaches for the next one in the series ... then get this book.Perhaps the best of all the fantasy series I've read. Oh, forget best fantasy - they're the best overall novels! More, More, More ... I want more!Please, for goodness sake, get this first trilogy and fall in love with Fitz Chivalry Farseer as I did."
3,Not sure about this one,First..I love where this book started but didnt like where it ended. I know there is other books in the series but I really cant see myself reading the rest. To get any kind of action you gotta read the book until page 300..and I know its nickpicking..but after reading The Way of Shadows..I was disappointed in this novel. The only character that intrigued me to continue reading to learn more about was The Fool. Just didnt leave a gotta read the rest in the series feeling.
5,The first book I actually finished,"I love to read but can never seem to find a book that I like. This book was the first; I read it in a week. Couldn't wait for the sequel. I loved that it was in first person. I felt like I was fitz living his life. When I sat down to read I shut the world out, it was like for a short time I entered another world far away. The Farseer triliogy is the best I have ever read."
5,Read this book! Read this series!,"I have no idea why Robin Hobb (Megan Lindholm) isn't ranked alongside Jordan, Martin, Goodkind, Modesitt, Brooks, etc. She is an exceptional writer and the Farseer series is truly remarkable. Hobb takes classic elements of fantasy and weaves a tale rich with unprecedented creativity and originality. It goes without saying that these books were impossible to put down. Even more so, I am still floundering for something to read, in the wake of these books, that will satiate as well these (I've only just ordered The Liveship Traders . . .). Do yourself a favor and order all three at the same time--it's not particularly pleasant to have to wait until the next day to see what next befalls young Fitz.""A good book is the precious lifeblood of a master spirit, embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life."" --Milton"
4,"Not my cup of tea, Good thing I prefer coffee","I purchased this book because it was free for the Kindle. I only read historical romance and evonavich, so I did not want to like a science fiction book. It was slow for the first few chapters but then I just needed to know what happened next. When I finished, I was disappointed because I wanted to know more of the fool. Well Lucky me, Robin has provided two more books for this series and a spin off series which I think is about the fool. I am now commited to Robin Hobb, excellent story and interesting characters."
5,Assassin's Apprentice,"I first read this book when I was on a train ride across the Midwest. I picked it up by chance in a bookstore in Boise, ID and read it nearly non stop until I reached Omaha, NE. Sixteen years and many re-reads later it is still my favorite fantasy novel, and I have read nearly everything Ms.Hobb has written. This book is by far, in my opinion, her magnum opus.As I scanned through some other reviews by readers and some by critics, I saw statements like ""too slow"" and ""forumulaic"". Being a hardcore fantasy and sci-fi reader myself, I couldnt disagree more. The narration and plot are perfectly executed, and the characters finely developed.If you are a fantasy fan, and haven't read anything by Ms. Hobb, you'll definitely want to check this one out. If you have read her work, but not this one, then be sure you don't miss it!"
4,good start to a series,"I really enjoyed this book. It was a great start to a series.Enjoyed the community and kind of ""shenanigans within a safe fortress"" feeling this book gave me.I also enjoyed the kind of 'mission style' plot development.I have to say that I was disappointed by the third book in this series."
1,Worst Book Ever,"If you're a happy person, and enjoy life, this series will make you want to kill yourself. Slowly. Painfully. I literally burned my books and was violent with rage after reading this series."
4,I was reluctant,"I went in search of a book series to read after I finished what is available for Game of Thrones, and was reluctant. While there were not as many cliff hangers as was in the Game of Thrones series (though most of those were caused by switching characters), it was still a great read. So much so, that I purchased the next book right after I finished the first."
4,"wonderful writer, enjoyable read","Love, love, love Robin Hobb. Great character development and emotional verity. I've read six books so far and thoroughly enjoyed every one of them."
5,Head and Shoulders above most other fantasy reads,"I've had this book and its two companions sitting on my shelves for years now, but kept putting off reading them as most fantasy novels I've tried have been lacking in originality and genuinely likable characters. These books have both."
4,Take a chance !,"I did alot of research on this model and after months of going crazy I decided on this Plasma. First I would like to compliment Amazon for their professional sale and delivery of this product. I was like several people who questioned spending big money and ordering it online. Hey guess what?Amazon lives up to its reputation and sold it for a great price and it got delivered in perfect condition. Thanks Amazon for not letting me down. You guys have my vote. Oh yea, the tv, I like it so far."
4,Everything I could ask for for lees than $1300,Moving I broke my old piece of crap television giving me an excuse to buy this one. My apartment is extemely bright so the anti glare was a must and works pretty good. If you're on a budget this set is great. Plenty of component spots and HDMI. Comes with a stand but I mounted mine on the wall and it looks great. Loads of setting options you'll definately find something that suits your situation. I found that the picture quality is not different enough to justify spending an extra $1000-$1500 dollars on a good 1080p set.
4,A very satisfied buyer,I brought this TV about a month ago and so far everything worked as they should be. The HD picture is near perfect and the standard TV via cable box and satelite reciever is also good. Sleek look and easily mountable with almost perfect picture.
1,Cheaply Made,"I got this clock as a gift for my wife. She used it for two days and on the second day when trying to push the button to shut off the alarm something broke off inside the clock causing the alarm button to come loose. We had to remove the battery to shut off the alarm. It is compact and the visual design is really attractive, but I wouldn't recommend it if you want it to work."
3,Sony SRF-HM22 AM/FM Headphone Radio Walkman,Works great but I bought it with the plastic stability strap missing which is necessary for stability of the headphones.It falls forward every time I bend over but the price was right for a used item.
5,Great to use with online students,"I am a teacher at an online K-12 school. Writing is an area my 2nd and 3rd grade students really needed help with. I received permission from the publisher (on the phone and in writing) to use the book in my virtual classroom. The book is amazing, written with language kids can understand, full of examples to demonstrate a technique, and the lessons go well with teaching the six traits of writing. After teaching a good portion of the lessons found in the book, my students began writing more detailed and creative stories. They were willing to take chances and try new techniques. Highly recommend this book!"
2,"Wow, the ball really was dropped on this one","This book was excellent until the middle of it, when the story starts to go to Amadea. I couldn't believe how many loose threads this story left. There was so much Danielle Steel could have done to make this complete. We never know what happens to Beata, Daphne or anyone else important in the first part of the book. I felt gipped in reading it. Also I felt Amadea being a Carmelite Nun, and then falling in love with men very easily with not much of a problem was an issue. With her latest books not being any of my favorites.. I'm wondering if her best days are behind her."
4,Excellent work with history,This was a wonderful book which inter mingled romance along with the terror of the holocost. It was a fine piece of writing which kept me on the edge of me seat. Danielle Steel incorporates just enough twists to keep you guessing. There's nothing like a love story that makes it way through tragedy.
2,Now remember why I stopped reading Dianielle Steel novels...,"Read her books for years but 3 quarters of the way through I knew what would happen and was left feeling like I didn't get closure. Too many loose ends that could have been explained. Like an 1940 MGM musical thats states ""alls well that ends well"".I was disappointed and will not buy again."
4,Different,This was not your typical D. Stelle. The characters were more rounded out. The one thing I hate about her book generally is that she will make a statement and then reiterate the same statement using different words for another 3 pages. Also even though fun you can always guess where the story is going next. A basic formula exists in most of her books. This was more interesting than most.2nd audio (2set special)was entertaining. The way the child was protrayed was especially cute.
5,great story,I thought the book Echoes was a great story. The book had a lot of history to it which I thought was good. The characters were very strong in what they went through in the story. I have read many of Danielle Steel books this was one of her best books. I would highly recommend this book. It is great reading
4,Under dire circumstances,"Only under the most dire circumstances would I have read a Danielle Steel book. But since it was the only book available to me at the time, I read it. And it was good.Ms. Steel is criticized for ""telling"" the story, not ""showing"" it (one of the mantras of The Literati). And, yep, that's right. Not only does she break all the rules of writing as put forth in How-To books, but she leaves numerous threads unresolved. So much for the technical aspects!In fiction, you have to suspend disbelief. This is especially true for this book. Why would a half-Jewish nun be shipped from Prague to Paris? Oh yes, to keep the story going and to add a number of derring-do scenes. Completely illogical.But then again, as a kid, I loved Grimm's Fairy Tales and that's what we have here -- a morality play."
4,8+ years,"I've had this phone for 8+ years now, and it still works fine. (I did need to replace the battery once.) I use it as a wall-mounted phone and have knocked the phone to the floor a few times--I suppose it could be better designed to prevent that, but it's been sturdy enough to not be bothered by it."
4,Quick Picks,"Missing Persons & The Motels / Back to Back: Five of the best from Missing Persons combined with five of the best from The Motels. A natural combination and a nice collection without Any possibility of filler. The Back to Back series does not always work, but it suits these two bands very well. Four Stars"
4,Really good Not Great.,Thier is a tremendous amount of information in this volume and for that I give it four stars. I am an aviation mechanic who has looked to it as a reference more than once and not found the aviation word or term I was looking for. For that I cannot give it five stars. Still a valuable reference.
3,magazine holder for treadmill,"This is OK. I need to buy some velcro tape or something to make it hold to my treadmill better. But, all in all, I like it and it gets the job done. I'm using my treadmill more, now that I have the magazine holder."
4,Reading Rack for Treadmill,"This reading rack not only fits my older-model treadmill, but allows me to read while I'm using the treadmill. The only reason why I didn't give this product 5 stars is because it interferes a little with the controls on the treadmill. Other than that, it works just fine. I highly recommend it."
5,The Pianist,I bought this for my mom. The book even though used-was in such good condition - looked new. Will have no problem purchasing used again.
3,"Mildly entertaining, but mostly disappointing","I generally like golf fiction, but this novel was not one of my favorites.The book involves a first year law student who is spending his summer interning at the law firm where Bobby Jones had worked. He is assigned the task of organizing and cataloging Bobby Jones' old files. During the summer, he discovers notes and correspondence about a mysterious golfer/client named Beau Stedman. According to the story, Beau Stedman had been quite the young phenom golfer prior to being accused of murder.Set against this backdrop, the story becomes part John Grisham novel and part ""Bagger Vance."" Unfortunately, it doesn't do either well. There is not enough intrigue to keep you in suspense and not enough ""magic"" or ""mysticism"" to keep you amused.Having said all of that, the book is still mildly entertaining. For a more enjoyable read within this genre, I would recommend ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"", ""Golf in the Kingdom"" or ""Miracle on the 17th Green."""
2,Veron writes like a lawyer,"J. Michael Veron apparently sat down to write The Greatest Player Who Never Lived in the same manner a trial lawyer would write a closing argument. He tells us what he's going to say, then he says it, then he sums up what he just said. There was very little tension in the story, only piles of documents to sift through along with the main character. It is at times laborious reading with a pleasant twist at the end. Golf fanatics and lawyers (who play golf) will enjoy it. Otherwise skip this tiresome read."
3,Expanded Short Story,"A nice, heart-warming book but no more than anexpanded short story. It is very short and thewriting is very simple. It never rises abovethe contrived setting but is so positive and upbeatyou can't help but like it. It isn't literatureby any stretch and it shouldn't cost what itdoes. Don't expect too much and you will berewarded."
3,GPS for tourists,"Useful, hand-held set of street, transportation, and attraction maps for a visitor to London. Be sure to get an up-to date copy."
1,Don't Waste Your Money On This One,"Because the artist is Geoffrey Oryema, I start with 5 stars. However:Subract two stars for a recording error on track 17. This was a first, in my hundreds of CDs.Subtract one star because of the lack of equalization. It ruins the listening experience to have to adjust the volume between tracks. One track can be so very soft, the next disturbingly loud.Subtract one star for the ridiculous price of this CD, considering the poor quality described above.For the insert explaining the songs, despite the typographical errors, leave a star. Besides, this rating system won't allow for zero stars.This is not a comment on the artist, only on the label. I have collected all of his work, even though it is a bit too westernized for my taste. And to note, all of my other Oreyma CDs are on the RealWorld label. They are excellent! So buy the original albums and avoid this compilation."
4,A great resource for improving interpersonal relationships,"What's different about this book are the temperaments themselves (choleric, sanguine, phlegmatic, melancholic - instead of the standard Myers-Briggs type) and learning how to ""guess"" temperaments by observing body-types and favorite colors. What's missing are ""quizzes"" to help figure out what temperament you are and helpful hints on working with others of different temperaments. The information is presented in an easy-to-read conversational style. I recommend it as a supplement to other books on temperaments (my favorites being ""Kids, Parents and Power Struggles"" and ""Raising your Spirited Child"") and not as your only source for information on this subject."
3,"COOL ON THE OUTSIDE, NOT AS COOL ON THE INSIDE","This game is pretty fun. When I first heard about it, it sounded like the best game around...the fact that you didn't have to use the control pad sounded really cool. The game itself also looked really cool. It's kinda like a neon see through pink. The first time I played it was at a friends house, and it was pretty fun so I went out and bought it. It is fun, but the fact that you have to keep moving the gameboy around can get a little anoying. If the light in the room is dim, and you have the game boy tilting down, then you can't really see the screen. I recomend it to people with a lot of patience."
3,I leaned the hard way,"This is a really fun game, and the graphics and sound are great... only problem is that is is not GBA SP compatible (I don't know about regular GBA). It loads fine and looks good, but because it works on a motion sensor chip, and GBC cards point down, and GBA SP cards point up, up is down and down is up, and right is left and left is right. You COULD learn to compensate for this, but what a pain!If, though, GBA regular loads cards the way GBC does, it should make a great addition to your collection. If you have GBA SP, and no GBC, I can't recommend it. Of course, you can get a GBC for $10. at GameStop, if you really want to play this particular game. It is a pretty nifty game."
3,Not bad. At least they came with Grilles.,"The speakers are better than stock speakers and they come with grilles that are not too bad. If you are looking for a replacement for a factory slim mount 5 inch, these will serve you well. Do not expect high end sound and you will not be disappointed."
3,"Neat watch, but not waterproof nor water resistant","I ordered this watch, but found upon arrival that the owners manual says it is not waterproof nor water resistant. Which is too bad, as it looks nice, and the braille feature is interesting."
5,Holy Guacamole!!,"Lawrence Tierney is one bad dude. This is an excellent crime-noir, introducing Lawrence Tierney and unleashing him on the unsuspecting public. Mr Tierney stars as John Dillinger in this film of his rise and fall. Dillinger starts on his life of crime at the hands of a b-girl. He gets sent up the river where he falls in with a group of professional bank thieves. The leader, ""Specs"", disrespects our Man, and you know where that leads. Be afraid! There is a lot of implied violence which is very chillingly portrayed. The movie is beautiful to look at and Mr Tierney is all cold nasty, sexy rage. Recommended."
1,"Great demo, or was this the game?","The game play is great, but what happened to the game? I finished the arcade mode in less than 20 minutes. This is more like a demo than a game. I never played any videogame as short as this one. I definitely would not recommend ...it in fact I wouldn't recommend buying it. Stick to the arcade version."
4,Boss Smart Vac is a good one!,"I like my new vacuum. The accessories are neatly attached. It does a good job on tile, carpet, or wood floors. It is heavy, but I knew that when I bought it. It is not good for doing stairs because it is not possible to balance it on the stairs without falling down them! The price is excellent for the cleaning power!"
4,Eureka 4870 HZ-Very Good,"This vacuum is very good on carpet, and does a decent job on tiles floors...I am a little disappointed in the way it cleans the tile floors, not as good as my old canister, at least I don't think so, but the carpets look new after vacuuming them with this unit."
3,Rebuilt?,"I've only had this vac for a week and I've used it twice with great success. My real concern is that on the back of the unit the manufacturer sticker says ""Rebuilt"". I've gone over this page again and again looking for mention of this item being refurbed or rebuilt and see none."
1,purchaser,"This vaccuum is a a piece of junk, I am an 82 year old widower and did not need a vaccuum for heavy use. After the unit arrived I used it to vaccum out my car a couple time and it worked well. After a few weeks I tried to vaccum my rugs, the rotor brush did not work(the rotor brush was actually fitted wood pieces, that assure a long useful life), and it was fitted with a belt much too big, took it to a local repair shop,was told they no longer produce belts for this model and there is no way to fix it fit so it will clean rugs. Been trying to contact the source it was purchased from, I have send four emails, NOT ONE RESPONSE. I have a lemon on my hands and apparently no recourse. Been a sour experience. Steer clear of the vaccuum vendor (Allergy something) Robert L Brewer"
4,"Great for cleaning, hard to manuver though","I have had this vacume for three weeks now. I am 9 months pregnant, with an ocd for cleaning. I vacume twice a day. For sheer cleaning power, this is the best vacume I have ever owned. We did not have the money to shell out on a dyson, so this is the next best thing for the budget friendly. What I like is the suction power and the attachments. It comes with a lot. The down size is that its a little heavy and stiff. This is a great vacume for one floor houses or apartments. I would not recommend it if you are going to be useing one vacume for multiple floors."
2,pésimo para el que NO sabe de escritura japonesa,"Cuando compre este libro y el otro que esta en venta de japones al ingles no pense que no iba a estar ordenado por orden de palabras romanizadas, es decir, si quieres buscar una palabra es estos diccionarios y no conoces la escritura japonesa, mejor no lo compres ya que sera una tarea titanica.aparte que tiene muy pocas entradas para lo que vale.chao"
2,What an annoying book!,"This book was lent to me when I broke my leg last month ""to make me forget my pain."" What pain? Claire, the narrator, is one of the most annoying characters I've ever met in fiction, self-absorbed, flighty, superficial, drunkard, shop-aholic, and we're supposed to sympathize with her antics? Not to mention her crazy sisters... The husband character in the story changes from being one of the most wonderful guys in the world to being a nit-picking jerk, which demonstrates either what a dim-wit Claire is at having so misjudged him, or a real flaw in the writer's skill. I stopped reading the book short of the last couple of chapters, it's just too painful!"
1,Pathetic waste of time!,"Don't bother with this book - it is truly an insult to one's intelligence - I can't beleive this trash was published as a ""bestseller""!I had to force myself through it in the hope that one of the numerous (badly timed & totally irrelevant) asides would actually have one iota of humour.You can't sympathize with the main character (or indeed give 2 hoots about ANY of the characters) because they are so transparently paper thin & predictable.Don't waste your time. I know I have. This was a very disappointing offering from a usually quite talented author."
5,A Wonderful Read!!,I am so glad I stumbled upon this delightful book. I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know the characters. I honestly miss reading about Clare and her crazy but funny family. I highly recommend this book!
2,Mindless Fluff,"I'll just ditto much of what the other 1 and 2 star reviewers have said, as I don't want to spend any more time on this book than I already have. This is my third Marian Keyes book and will be my last. I keep hoping for more but, I see they are all rambling, go-nowhere stories. I almost gave up on it but, plugged along and managed to finish."
3,A light read,"I enjoyed the book as an escapist read - very light, and I didn't find it especially funny as many others seem to have done. The end was just too unbelievable and predictable. Spoilt the whole thing for me!"
3,funny,"This book was very very very humourous - I was laughing throughout the ENTIRE thing....there is one problem though - LIKE NOTHING HAPPENS - I think if the author had mixed her humor with a bit more plot I could have enjoyed this 416 page novel Immensely, but I didnt"
5,A Great Summer Read!,I adored this book. The characters were very funny and real. I read it on the beach in about a day. A really fun choice for summer. I plan to read more of Marian Keyes' books.
2,Disappointed,"I enjoyed ""Rachel's Holiday"" and decided to try another book by Marian Keyes. I'm sorry I chose this one. While there were some amusing one-liners, I found little else to like. Nothing rang true - not the characters, not their relationships, and not the situations they found themselves in. I sympathized with Claire initially, but her self-absorbed babble wore thin all too soon. I got tired of the book about halfway through and skimmed to the end. I was almost sorry I did, because the scales were ridiculously tipped by the husband's behavior (though his description of Claire seemed pretty much spot on to me)."
2,Maybe I am just different but...,"I bought this book based on the glowing reviews I saw on Amazon. I expected a wildly funny book. I don't get it. I thought the book was slighly humorous but mostly very dull. I finished it because I try to always finish the books I start, but it was really not very good. It is written first person with conversations with the heroine's subconscious. Some aspects were cute. But the characters were just weird and the overall story was not very good. It was a let down after the reviews. After reading Watermelon I would certainly not read any other books by Marian Keyes."
4,Interesting characters,"I liked this book. It was different than the average mystery. The authors did an excellent job of developing characters, both protagonists and antagonists were well fleshed out and worthy of consideration. The plot was original and I found the story to live up to it nicely. The pace of this book will not let you go for a moment. I thought the twists were for the most part unexpected and unusual. The only thing that really bothered me about this book was one of the characters had an unusual accent that even though I didn't want to, I couldn't help but find entirely comical. That made it difficult to be serious when the book was actually intended to not be funny. Otherwise, there is some swearing in this book but I didn't feel it was uncalled for, and I would recommend it to those who like a good mystery. I've kept it on my shelf to read again later."
3,Less Than The Sum Total Of Its Parts,"Here we have a novel that can be neatly divided into three parts.The first third of this novel is gripping. Wonderfully written. Inspired even.The second is more pedestrian but still not bad.The third? It collapses like a souffle. I realised who the killer was long before the cops. And the glowering omission of a DNA test on the Keinfeldts/Monkeewrench posse? That was when the novel really plumeted out of the realms of plausability if not standard procedure.Ultimately, a disappointing read."
1,Predictable and Boring,"This book's plot was entirely predictable. All the characters were one-dimensional. The ending was stupid and made no sense. This book was so boring, it took me several sittings to get through it."
4,Great characters in a solidly plotted book,"The serial killer sub-genre of thrillers is overcrowded at the moment. And I, personally, started getting a bit tired of all this stuff. But 'Monkeewrench' is way above the rest of the bunch.I was attracted by a story, which has the killer coping murders from a computer game. The story is solid, with enough twists and a good ending.But the real treat are the characters. Every one of them is a pleasure to follow. This book even has a dog, which is more sympathetic then the main characters in some of the recent bestsellers! And the dialogue is up there with the best of Robert B.Parker.The mother-daughter team of the authors managed to create a set of characters, whom this reader will love to meet again and again. Not because they have the most amazing adventures imaginable. But because they are fun to be with."
5,"Great Characters, Great Storyline","This is such a great book! Not only is the story line suspenseful...the characters are real and very intesting. The writing style was so wonderful and the descriptions so well written that it almost felt like watching a great movie instead of reading a book. I would highly, highly recommend this book to any avid reader no matter what genre they prefer!!"
5,P.S.,"Just realized that P.J. Tracy will have another book coming out on April 22, 2004, with some of the same characters. Something to look forward to."
4,4 1/2 stars,"Synopsis.""Haunted by their pasts, Grace McBride and the crew of her software company, Monkeewrench, create a computer game where the killer is always caught and the good guys always win. But their game becomes a nightmare when someone begins duplicating the fictional murders in real life, down to the last detail.""I think the mother/daughter duo have written a wonderful debut.It will keep you guessing and it will keep you reading. The dialogue is humorous and the plot original. I look forward to more.Highly recommended."
4,funny football,"most don't think of Andy Griffith as an audio comic. ""What It Was, Was Football"" is really good! The others are fair to good as well. As always it takes an actor's passing for the studios to pull their finger out, and may-be now they will release Andy's other series ""Salvage One!"
3,Small and sounds like it,"Well, I was hoping for something louder. Wishful thinking. The speakers look great, but doesn't deliver the sound depth or volume I wanted. Sensitivity on these speakers must be low since Pyle didn't specify the dB level. I'll keep these to use for a future project."
1,boring,this album is dull and without any emotion.the only reason this guy is even known is because of his backgroud.
3,The Real Review,"I have never given a soundtrack a 5 star rating because even though they might have many talented artists on the bill, they seem to always throw out some excrement as well. Aaliyah's voice and persona are beautiful as always, and DMX is still tearing it up, but then they throw junk BG and Cash Money Records out there to make all the ignorant hip-hop fans happy in turn insulting the intelligence of the true fans. But then again to sell albums, I guess you have to try and please everyone. To me, it's better to shoot for the stars than aim for the gutter. It's an insult to to have Aaliyah and BG on the same bill."
2,Edited,"The music on this cd is great, the only problem is, I think I am old enough to make the decision if the cd is edited or not, I don't like it when I buy a cd and it is edited, when it is not posted, If you want a edited version buy this cd, other then that forget about it"
4,Great CD!,"I think this CD is really good. Lots of great stuff on there such as Aaliyah in ""Try Again,"" ""I Don't Wanna,"" ""Are You Feelin' Me,"" Aaliyah/DMX in ""Come Back In One Piece,"" Timbaland/Magoo in ""We At It Again,"" Dave Bing/Lil' Mo in ""Somebody Gonna Die Tonight,"" etc. The CD has so many great songs, except I give it one less star because some of the tracks such as BG in ""Rollin' Raw,"" and Mack 10/Comrades in ""Thugz."" I'm not feeling those songs and some others on the CD. Overall, this CD is very good, better than a lot of soundtracks I own."
2,Not bad,"Great CD but what dropped it three stars is the lack of Ithaka's ""Escape from the city of angels"". Oddly enough it was left off of the ""Replacement Killers"" soundtrack as well. Please let us know if you find it! Pretty good music to go along with the pace of the film."
4,Romeo Must Die...,"Is The Tightest Soundtrack Released Fo' 2000. Timbaland Once Again Proves That He Can Still Make You Make Bounce & Wiggle With His New-Produced Tracks By Aaliyah, Ginuwine, Magoo, As Well As Himself. There Were Other Banging Cuts By Up-N-Coming Producers, But Aaliyah Shines More Fo' The Soundtrack With 3 New Cuts. Pick Up The Soundtrack Now, And Also Check Out The Film Starring Jet Li, DMX, & Aaliyah, Wit Her Fine Self."
3,"Where's the rated ""R"" version?","The artists and the songs on this album are great, but what happened to the lyrics? Half the songs contain so called ""explicit"" lyrics in their original cut but are edited to the bone on the soundtrack. What went wrong? There is more censored silence in most of the songs than actual vocals. The movie was rated ""R"" so why can't the soundtrack be the same? I returned my copy and now I am searching for the ""adult"" version to satisfy my musical cravings. Hip-hop was not meant to be PG so stop hacking apart the songs and turning them into Barbara Streisand hits please!"
3,Music not on the soundtrack,"Hi,This technically isn't a review for the movie, its more along the lines of a hard to find music track. Anyone know of the techno/metal music track at the last fight scene between han(jet li) kai(russell wong)? Im not sure if its a multiple mixed track or if its one complete track, although in the movie it seems to be a one complete track with breaks, but thats Hollywood..:) lol"
3,It's Alright. Aaliyah and Joe make this one worth buying!,"It was not a great soundtrack in my view but the performances of Aaliyah with ""Try Again"", ""Back In One Piece"" and ""I Don't Wanna"" (which also appeares on the ""Next Friday"" soundtrack as well) along with Joe's ""Rose In A Concrete World"" makes this one worth getting! The other songs rate from stinkers to listenable."
4,Unique Review,"You no what hearing this soundtrack makes me eager to watch the film. Im feeling Ginuwines track ""Simply Irrisitrable"". With Aaliyah having four tracks on this soundtrack it makes me wonder which ones she's gonna have on her album."
2,Could be Happier,"I agree with everyone here, I need deep pocket sheets, these claim to fit up to a 14 or 15 inch mattress, mine are 15 deep, and, these don't even come close to fitting. Even after I used corner sheet straps, the sides were half way up the mattress. Very good quality sheets, but, they just don't fit deep pockets. I am giving mine away."
2,Not for thick mattresses,My mattress is only 13 inch thick. It does not fit very well.But it's good quality sheet.
4,The Osama Target,"It worked OK for my hand guns but was a little small for my daughter's bazooka. Could you make 'Super Beards' head just a little bigger and make a provision for an exploding balloon full of red paint for realism? Do they make this target as a road side type like the old Burma Shave signs, would be fun to do drive by's on the jerk while going to work in the morning."
3,Meh,"I guess I was expecting more than just Bin Laden. And they looked like they had just been printed on a big inkjet printer. Not terribly fancy (although, I know they're going to just get destroyed) but they're not horrible."
1,Found Better with No CHEMICALS!,"I have used Canus, but was very disappointed that it contained mostly sulfates and preservatives. Now, I use nothing but products made by Wendylou's Natural Bath. Homemade vegetable based bath and body products which my whole family uses and loves."
3,Terrible Star War,"Given the year it was published, the book was actually pretty amazing in telling a story centered around an AI computer. Although it took me a while to get used to the linguistic awkward and many times I had to read slowly and repeatedly, I've pretty enjoyed the first two parts. However, the last part of the book, the real war between Earth and Lunar, in spite of short, was completely BS. It's hard to believe lasers used for drilling would not be made for weapons and mounted on space battle cruisers. It's hard to believe that Earth would not take technological advantage but rather send ground troops for close combat. It's hard to believe the rocks thrown by Lunars would not be intercepted in the space much close to Moon. Nor that Lunars would not be swamped by military satellites from Earth side. In the essence, the battle described in the book was between Lunar of 2070s and Earth of 1970s, which was quite laughable."
5,Favorite Heinlein novel,"This is, as far as I am concerned, RAH's best novel. He'd gotten his skills up, and he wasn't quite to the point where, apparently, editors were afraid to edit him. (No, I don't know if that was what was going on with his last works, but it sure felt like it!)You have believable futuristic societies, and inevitable conflicts. Heinlein has points to make, but they are not done stridently, at least to my perspective. It's a good rousing tale of Moon colonists going independent from Earth, and it works well. I first read this years ago in the early 70s and the tale still hold water. His best novel by far, from my experience."
2,"Fun, but pretty brain-dead.","It's sexist, it's simplistic, it's kind of fun. Heinlein creates his fantasy world, where people without good manners are simply killed, society thrives without any government, and revolution is easy, fun, and mostly bloodless. Women are to be whistled at and are supposed to appreciate it and twirl for the guys. There's a whole range of wildly impractical marital arrangements which seem to work flawlessly. Also, there's a nearly omniscient machine which helps the revolution. Very convenient.Oh and the science! Did you know that farming in sub-terran tunnels is so cheap on the moon, it somehow makes economical sense to ship food to Earth? Somehow, farming in tunnels on Earth would be MUCH more expensive. Huh?Still, if you want to turn off your brain and imagine that you can overthrow the government with a computer, a professor, and a blonde at your side, this is your book!"
5,Heinlien's best book.,"The most exciting, thought rocking book Heinlien wrote. None of the preachiness of his later books."
5,"Go to a used book store, get the cheaper paperback version",Agree with all above. Just save some money as it has been out in paperback for several decades
4,Thought provoking!!,"I went into the reading of this book as a dreaded high school assignment some time ago, and came away with a haunting image of a society losing individuality and imagination. I was infuriated by the idea that the loss of the characteristics which make us unique was acceptable, expected, and desired. It made me think of what my own ideas of cloning really were, at a time when the subject was just becoming feasible. Have you ever pondered what a society of, say, ten people created over and over into hundreds would be like? This book gives just one view of that situation. As limited as that view may seem, it really opened my mind, and helped me to understand where I want to be in this issue. I HIGHLY suggest reading it, especially if you have followed any of the latest developments in regards to the subject of cloning."
1,An album of noise and sound-effects,"Why would any one want to buy an album of noise ? ? I guess if you need some kind of background noise or sounds if you were making a movie soundtrack..... , otherwise ? ? ?"
3,The role of categorics,"Philosophy is an apt topic of concision, nonetheless covering areas eclectic to expertiseI intend to write my own encyclopedia on the subject of philosophical paedism|| Symbolism, Linguistics, Sidereality, and Acoletics|| may be available in some form in the next two years, one of the only volumes available in considering categoric knowledge alone (ala Kant)256 pages cover topics ranging from Space-Time to Archana in a form of recundite categorics[...]"
5,a joy to use,"definitely a nice tool, lightweight, simple, well made, good cutting blades as other reviewers have noted. Like much better than using power hedge shears.My only complaints are that I did not buy sooner, and that they don't make an even longer version."
5,Perfect,"Clean cuts, easy to handle, and the extendable handles help me get to spots where I'd otherwise need a ladder."
3,Prepared in a rush,"The book does contain a lot of useful information, but the amount of typos is frustrating. Every other equation used in this book contains errors. The equations often contain notations that are not defined anywhere in the book.Some sections need cleaning - they contain miriad of equations which can be significantly simplified and their number reduced via a thoughtful layout strategy.I am not new to OCT and I am considering this book as a reference source, but right now I believe the book is not yet ready to be a book. Perhaps later editions will be much better."
3,Not the best anymore,"Four years earlier this was the only book available as a text book for OCT, but now there are more options and in my opinion there are other books which are better than this one. Specially with the technology now moving from time domain to Fourier domain there are many concepts which are missing in this one that you will find in the recent ones."
5,Great Reading!,"This book is about two children in the early 1900's living in Egypt. Stas, a 14-year old boy and proud of his Polish heritage, feels he has to protect his young 8-year old British friend, Nell. But he is challenged when they are both kidnapped by Arabs and cross deserts, meeting cruel and heartless Gebhr, and Idris, who is torn out of wanting to take the children to the Madhi in Khartoum as slaves and pity for them. When they arrive at disease-infested Khartoum and Stas comes face-to-face with the Madhi, they again are taken by order of the Madhi to Fashoda, where the children meet the slaves Kali, really the son of the king of the Wahima tribe, and Mea. After Gebhr threatens to kill the children, Stas shoots them and the four escape on a journey with many challenges and obstacles, to go back home.This book is definitely one of Sienkiewicz's best, and if you like adventure, it will make a great read!"
5,Belive me!!,"I bought this album on 2 reasons, one was the fact that I loved Mac's style of rapp'n and the reviews that people gave it! Belive me when I say that this album is the BOMB!!!!!Buy it and thrape them lyrics!!"
4,Another release from the NL,"Mac has finally dropped his first album and it's pretty good. Mac is recognizable as the only NL Soldier that is a stereotypically talented rapper. He has a smooth flow and it clashes with the guest rappers on a couple of tracks. One of the better songs is 'Paranoid'. Although it is an obvious rip-off of Geto Boy's classic 'Mind Playin Tricks on Me' it still works. The best track is 'Be All You Can Be' w/ Fiend, Silkk & Mo B. Dick. 'Wooo' & 'Murda Murda Kill Kill' are two other great tracks. Overall, it's worth the money for any rap fan out there."
5,Tight as hell,I think that Shell Shocked is one of the tightest albums No Limithas ever came out with. He shocked me and damn near every otherNo Limit fan with his lyrics. I hate that he's in the pen but if he gets out he needs to come out with another head bangin album like this. I haven't heard World War III yet but I doubt that it's as tight as this album. If you are a true Tank Dogg you'll get this banger.
4,"Ooh, Chris O'Donnell, Ooh, Minnie Driver","I have loved this movie since I first saw it over 10 years ago. I'm so glad I found a copy here, because it's still, such a wonderful film. Minnie Driver is incredible, a lovely trainwreck, and Chris O'Donnell is so lovely."
1,"""Help!!""","I have read all of Maeve Binchy's novel's and I am a huge fan. However, I was so disappointed in this movie adaptation! The story was so drastically changed that I felt that I was not watching the same story. Benny and Eve's childhood, was barely touched on--and when it was at the very beginning 'facts' were altered. Eve's relationship with the Sisters who raised her was entirely forgotten, as was Benny's difficult relationship with her parents. If you're interested in Maeve Binchy stick strictly to the novels. I do believe Minnie Driver and Cris O'Donnell are talented and fine actors, they played their parts well, despite the fact that the story was not adapted acurately."
3,Good Movie but Desecration when you think of the BOOK,For anyone that has read Circle of Friends...don't expect this movie to resemble the book..minnie driver does a good job as benny hogan - i think she captures the character and her spirit well...she is a joy to watch... but i didn't like how many of the characters were depicted...benny's parents are shown as close-minded... kind of mean .. needlessly strict... in the book they're strict... but you still feel the loveand they ignored Eve... who had a lot of personality in the book...but had no role at all in movie...I understand that a movie can't have all the parts of a book.. but at least the essence should stay the same...this would be a good movie if I hadn't read the book
4,Sweet Irish Fairy Tale,"This story is structured very much like an Irish fairy tale. It is about three girls who are best friends since early childhood. All but one live in poverty. They grow up and go to college in Dublin. Two of the girls fall in love; the third wants to marry for money. Bennie, the girl who lives in relative comfort, falls in love first with a boy named Jack. Her parents, however, want to set her up with a sleazy man who works for them in her father's shop. Eve is being brought up by nuns in a very strict environment. The third friend lives in dire poverty with an alcoholic father. It is she that wants to marry for money.The movie is sweet and poignant, with the inevitable ups and downs of girls in love, betrayals by each other and by men. The photography is beautiful and made me want to return to Ireland again.I recommend this movie for an easy viewing pick. Get some popcorn, set yourself down and have an enjoyable two hours."
5,The ultimate party song,"If you haven't heard this song yet than I think you should.This is the best party song that I have ever heard.The first time I heard it was in Germany at some party.Everyone just started dancing and I wasn't concentrating on the song so I didn't really catch what was going on.When I got back to South Africa I heard the song again and it just hit me what a cool party song it is.You know it is one of those sing along songs that everyone can learn and the beat og the music is just....I can't even explain it. I have been looking for the cd for the last 3 months but you can't buy it anywhere in South Africa. I don't really have 11US$ so I thought I would write a review and see if I am luck enough to win that 50US$ voucher, so that I can buy the cd. Please take my review in consideration. Thank you"
4,Emphasize the word 'novelty'........,"""Hey Baby (Uh Ah)"" is an updated version of the old Bruce Channel song that took Europe by storm last summer. Reaching number one in almost every country it was released in, this song isn't too bad just as long as you remember it's supposed to be a novelty song. The chorus is highly infectious (it's what the song is best remembered for), and the track is accompanied by powerful dance beat. I prefer listening to the 'extended club mix' version as this was the one played mostly in the top European resorts last summer. ""Uh Ah"" is really nothing more than an instrumental version of the lead track. The follow-up single, ""Do Wah Diddy (Party Mix)"", and the album which this song hails from, ""Never Stop The Alpenpop"" are both terrible though - proving DJ Otzi is destined to become yet another one-hit wonder.....Jon"
1,Don't waste your money...,"Don't waste your money on this film (if you can it a film). I could only stand to watch the first 20 minutes or so of this production. It is more like a slideshow of pictures, and the limited ""voice over"" was actually a computer programmed voice program that didn't do anything to elevate this production."
2,****YOU MUST BUY EXTENDED WARRANTY*******,"I bought a Satellite A135-S4527 1 year ago and my warranty just expired. I am very gentle with my laptop and the monitor went out. Toshiba tech support will not talk to you unless you give them a credit card and I have found that to replace the monitor (part alone) is $400 +. This is more than half the price of a new laptop. It doesnt make sense. So if you buy Toshiba get that extended warranty. Remember, when they sell something cheap its for a reason. Good luck"
1,Doesn't work as HDMI extender,I purchased this product because i wanted to extend my hdmi wire. i had two hdmi cables 3 meters each and i wanted to join them together but with no luck using this device.
5,HDMI coupler,"After going to RADIO SHACK and told the price was $17 for this coupler, I dicided to get on the internet and check out the prices..... a buck and a quarter was MUCH better than $17.... AND IT WORKS GREAT..... enough said.DON'T EVER GO TO RADIO SHACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Gift bag for an Obama fan,I used this as a gift bag for similarly themed gifts for my aunt's birthday. It was a little lower in quality than I expected. My main complaint is that the likeness to Michelle isn't as close as I has presumed it would be. I felt the face could've been better.
4,Hilarious,"Balzac is at his best in this very witty tale about a devious old maid who schemes against her family in nineteenth-century France. It's so much fun to watch the contemptible Bette manipulate everyone around her, and to follow her pathetic and ill-placed obsession for a certain young Polish character who marries her young, beautiful cousin.Everything fun is in this book-courtesans, lecherous old men, unfaithful young lovers, and of course, the virtuous, who get treated terribly and die abandoned and alone. Wretched Bette dies loved and valued. You will have a lot of fun reading this book and enjoying-and getting disgusted with-all the characters."
2,Just so you know...,"FYI, it would seem the basic chair doesn't include the lumbar support despite the photo showing it."
4,Excellent product if fitted properly....,"I have had an Aeron chair for many years. I was fairly careful to size it properly and set it up as I wanted. When I bought it, I figured that my body was worth the price averaged over ten years. Simply in terms of adjustability this chair provides a solution to nagging problems. I use it at a computer for many hours a day and have no complaints. The Posturefit was not available when I bought mine, but I do have the lumbar support and adjustable armrests. I spent some significant time setting it up for me and it has paid off. I especially like the tilt limiter. Buying a cheap chair every year for $50 is not really a bargain. This chair is excellent value to me."
1,does not deliver what is promised,very overblown & the description hypes up WAY more than you get...music is distracting and annoying. only 1 really believable scene in the whole program. not worth the money and they need to get better directors if they want to rip people off.
3,Bolle Sunglasses,Nice sunglasses only problem is they are loose. Not sure if they can be adjusted for a better fit.
3,Ho Hum,Not as engaging in characters or plots as the Stephanie Plum novels. Both character development and plot seemed overly contrived and personally midway through the novel I really didn't care what happened. The upcoming marriage of Jamie and Max was a water-downed affair and didn't really add any interest to the storyline. The mystery lacked suspense and some of the new characters were dull. Give me Lulu or Grandma Mazur anytime! I'd rather wait for the next Plum novel than a new book in this series.
4,"Funny, cute romance story","I bought the audio version to listen to while driving on a long road trip. The story was funny, cute and plenty of romance."
5,A hard grooving kinda album,"Phantom Power is the latest from the Canadian super group The Tragically Hip. It is an amazing album which is led by the wonderful vocals of frontman Gord Downie. Each song has its own unique sound and style from hard rockin songs like Membership and Fireworks to more reflective songs like Bobcaygeon and Escape is at hand for the Travellin' Man. From the opening lines of Poets ""Spring starts when our heart beats pounding..."" to the rockin end of Emperor Penguins it is a inticing musical journey for your mind. So sit back and let the ""Phantom Power"" journey begin."
2,Awful,"OK. I'll give it a generous 2 stars because musically, it's pretty good. But the vocals?!?! Oh my goodness---the vocals. Worst I have EVER heard. I could sing better. To Steve Walsh I would like to say brother, when it gets this bad, do us all a favor and go get a job in the private sector. At least they include ""Dust In The Wind"", and bring Kerry Livgren on stage to sing it. Kerry sounds pretty good on it---except for the high notes. Walsh introduces him as ""an old friend"". That's a laugh. Livgren was and always will be Kansas. The band basically threw him out, due to ""artistic differences"". Pretty sad when a guy's Christian influences in the music lead the band to pretty much boot him.If you are going to get some Kansas CDs, get ""Leftoverture"" or ""Point of Know Return"". However, if you want to spend $6.98 for a nice coaster, then I'd go with this one.Oh yeah---did I mention how bad the vocals are on this?"
3,Eh..,If it was a lot quicker and better range I'd rate it a 5 but other than that..it takes forever to turn off Tvs!
1,Doesn't Work,I've only tried this on about three or four TV's of various makes and models (all of them newer models) and it has yet to work on a single one.
2,its ok,"well its no sonic screwdeiver, but it DOSE turn on SOME tvs. but it takes like 8 munits. and it only works 1/6 of the time."
3,LSD Inspired?,"Tom Mcguane may be friend and neighbor to Tom Brokaw now, but he must have been on LSD to write this book back in the early 70's. Interesting, but just too FAR OUT MAN."
2,Not believable,"I had high hopes for this book as I am in love with Key West and fishing. I was hoping for something along the lines of ""The Old Man and the Sea"". The story was a total disappointment. Although the writer knows how to write, he does not know how to concoct a believable story."
2,Doesn't seem complete.,"I tried and tried the techniques in this book and the newer 2000 and just didn't see tangible results in my learning. Going over the material in such detail to record the tapes in preparation, seems to offer the only benefit - the actual listening to music part does next to nothing, in my opinion and experience, in its presented form. Great concept, needs something more."
5,"Excellent, no distortion, well built.","This is an excellent, longer length VGA cable. I've been using it for about three years without a problem. The image is clean, sharp without any distortion. I connect my computer to a 37"" LCD TV. The resolution is 1366 x 768. I've played all sorts of video files, displayed on my TV through this VGA cable, and they all display fine.It's very sturdy, well built, shielded and has ferrite beads at both ends. The ferrite beads (you may have also seen these on the USB cables that come with digital cameras) help reduce common mode current running along the shield, which can cause distortion in the signal.Before buying this cable I bought a cheaper VGA cable from Belkin or Tripp Lite and the image quality was terrible---blurry, lines were offset and wavering, etc. I sent it right back and Amazon fully refunded me."
1,Poor quality image - unusable - sent it back,"With this cable, the monitor image quality was poor. Text had serious ghosting and there was an overall red tint. The monitor worked fine with a DVI and DisplayPort cable of similar length. I was using this for a 24"" LCD monitor at 1920x1200.I sent this cable back - thanks Amazon for making that painless."
5,Love the Entire Series!!!,Could not put the entire series down once I started. You have to read all 3!! The author does a wonderful job of translating Scotland to the pages and you can feel the love pour out between the characters.I highly recommend this to anyone who likes a romantic read!
2,Kindle Download/Publisher Proofreading Errors,I am half way through the book and have been surprised at the amount of spelling errors that have been found in the Kindle Version. Very distracting. I am an avid reader of Christian fiction and have downloaded many books on my Kindle. I enjoy my Kindle and read from it daily. This book was the first were I found an error on almost every page that I have read. Higgs work is being sadly misrepresented by the publisher when read in the Kindle format. Proofreading from the publisher in this instance was minimal at best. Interfered with my ability to fully enjoy Higss story or the read.
2,Outdated in Animation and Story - Skip it,"If you want R-rated action, go with ""Ninja Scroll"". If you want PG-rated action, go with ""Dragon Ball Z - Tree of Might"". The animation look dated and cheap. The characters are card-board cutouts with no charisma. The story lacks originality. I stopped watching after 10 minutes. There are tons of better anime to be had, so skip this one."
2,Roger yesterday...Done That,"Should have given greater pause to the 7 reviews at the product site. This collection is too old, repetitive of his other albums,not indicative of Roger's ability to play and of less than good sound quality. I'm sorry that I was suckered in to buy it. Details were not listed when I ordered it. Had I known the sound tracks, I would not have bothered...those I liked in the past, I already had. The others...Yellow Bird, Cummana, near you etc.....Really? The only good things with this experience was the delivery with this seller."
1,godawful,"Spliced together from scenes of a 13 episode TV series run... good luck on that... so now I'll add more to hit 20 words and mention that I've viewed the 13 episodes with fan dubbing which weren't that bad, i.e. still recognizeable as to which short story they originate from, mainly those found in the ""Last Wish"" collection, along with bits from ""The Blood of Elves""."
1,Cheap for a reason,"This does not come with a chain. That is stated in the description, but I did not notice that when I ordered it, so that's something to be aware of. There is significant discoloration inside the locket, which would be mostly hidden by any photographs placed in it. The thing that I am displeased about is that the photograph of this pendant clearly shows the stone in the middle as being pink. The stone is not pink at all; it is a dark purple. The only nice thing I have to say is that I was pleased that the company shipped this to me quite rapidly."
3,"An ""OK"" bbq book","This book is ok. First thing you notice is how thin it is. Not much info in there. All it consists of is an assortment of a few BBQ recipies. The BBQ recipies are not necessarily incorrect BBQ, but that all they are. The book would be better if it had BBQ history, BBQ howto, and other BBQ related information. Just the straight recipies isnt enough. Granted, the begining has a couple pages on KC's bbq legends, but you only get a couple paragraphs on each. You also get very very litle information on important BBQ information, like the names of the cut of meat, the cooking techniques, etc. Really sparce. Plus, Rich Davis (father of KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce) should have put a recipe in for this famous sauce. This book is akin to an Anderson's (famous for their peasoup) cookbook, that omits a recipe for peasoup. Just doesnt make sense."
3,"Good, but Frustratingly Illustrated.","When this book was first published, it was one of a kind. It remains a good reference today, and it is surprising how much useful information the authors packed into a pocket-sized book. Bravo! Its illustrated plates, however, are suggestive of a broad-brush approach, particularly with the poor rendering of wing and tail shapes. (Nearly useless for silhouettes!) An unfortunate blemish on an innovative guide!The authors of this guide are also behind the well-regarded ""A Photographic Guide to North American Raptors."" And more recently, one author published two *superb* regional references (Raptors of Eastern North America: The Wheeler Guides,Raptors of Western North America: The Wheeler Guides) with Princeton University Press. These books are all worthy of your consideration."
2,Poor Design; No Ergonomic Consideration,What a disappointment! Prior reviews held much praise for the quality and construction of these shears. Sure the blades are sharp but that is of little consequence if your knuckles smash together each and every time the handles fully close. The aluminum handles bend quite easily too. Spend your $80.00 elsewhere... these shears will be returned.
2,Video is better than composite minus the HDTV experience,"With this kit, the colors in 480i mode are better than the composite cable that is included with the XBOX.However, if you want to run your XBOX in High Defination (HD), buy another product. When I set my XBOX to 480p, the text and color are horrid than composite cables. Setting it to a higher resolution such as 720p is equally bad. Though games runs smoother in progressive mode, 60 frames per second as oppose to 30 fps in interlaced, the image is just too ugly to tolerate.It's a acceptable product running at 480i and I'll keep it until I find a better replacement"
2,Tia Lola book review!,How Tia Lola Came To Stay is a decent book. Not good not bad just decent. I liked the spanish in other words... It is about a family that just moved from New York to vermount and the parents just got divorced the mom and kids go to vermount while the dad stays in New York. Their aunt vistits vermount from the Dominacan Republic and she knows litel english that is all i am going to tell you for the rest buy the book!
4,The Beauty of this Music,". . . Strangeness is a true American Beauty; everything about it smells like a rose. This music, largely instrumental, crawls into your sensorium and then starts radiating outward. The archaic symbols that the churning tunes awaken within oneself is comparable to The Power of Myth. And if popculture is your bag, as it is mine, then imagine a three-prong attack of Apocalypse Now, God Emperor of Dune, and Axis: Bold as Love prodding your mind into visions like a cerebral trident.The flow of this disc creates an effortless balance between the grounded and the ethereal. It is both the lion and the lamb! And Sparrow Orange is the third Aphex Twin! If you enjoy the works of King Crimson or The Residents, you should like this, and appreciate the value of its artistic direction."
5,Best rap la raza can jam 2,"This cd is still hitting hard in da souf, and its gonna be dat way 4 a long time."
2,If you like the Penthouse letters ...,"There's nothing wrong with this book as long as you understand what you're getting: a collection of Penthouse Forum letters for the house & home set. They are all suspiciously similar in tone, and for average people the contributors seem to know an awful lot of adjectives to describe their private parts."
3,Not as good as the competition,"If you want a book about two-wheel adventure in communist countries, far more enjoyable is ""Mi Moto Fidel: Motorcycling Through Castro's Cuba,"" a fascinating and sometimes hilarious, sometimes hair-raising story of a 7,000-mile journey and justifiably the winner of both the 2002 ""Travel Book of the Year"" and the North American Travel Journalist Association's Awards of Excellence ""Grand Prize."""
4,Overkill strikes again.,"This album took me by surprise. I was expecting a sound similar to ""From the Underground..."" and ""Necroshine,"" but this bad boy picks up where ""Bloodletting"" left off. Heavy as hell, no ballads. Each song is unique, and the songwriting is on par with Overkill's dark, straightforward outlook, but there isn't one stand out track that takes precedence over all others. I've played this disc straight through many times, and though that one killer cut is missing, listening to this album is still a pleasure. I guess there's nothing wrong with consistency, but hey, I like Overkill ballads!"
1,Natural beauty destroyed by photographic manipulation,"If you've ever enjoyed a sunrise, with the dew on the grass and birds serenading the sun - don't buy this DVD. The time lapse sequences are far too fast. The DVD is arranged in chapters, and I kept thinking there was a reason for chapters. However the film jumps quickly from one scene to another with no direction, theme, or purpose. There are some beautiful locations but their real impact is lost in this production. Also none of the location are identified."
1,Stuck the first day I used it!,Cleaned everything and installed the thermostat. Saw engine running cold for a long time. Uninstalled it and found it was stuck open in cold and hot water. Garbage!
2,Sweet Rocks!,"Glam Lives! While this selection carries few of their greatest,check out Desolation Boulevard farther down, which is undeniably their best. It contains all the original hits."
4,Best Overall Study Bible,"This is the best overall study bible I have used. The type is very readable, the notes don't overwhelm you but are there where they're needed. Only advice I would give is to get the genuine leather version if you can afford it."
2,Way too small,"I really expected this Organizer to hold letters or paper, but the only thing that fits in here are post-its. I will be returning it. I guess I should have looked at the measurements. I will be ordering something bigger. But other than that, it came within a few days and was packaged very well. If you are looking for some thing small this would be perfect."
4,"Pretty good, lots of movies- Mike Nelson (MST3K) is much funnier, though","If you have ever had a friend who tells you stories that should stand on their own, but instead must continually prop them up by reminding you how funny they are and how funny other people thought they were, then you have an idea of this book. You are told in each synopsis that each movie was so bad it was funny, but rarely does it come across as to why this is so. This may be more a fault of the format than the author, but as someone else stated- you're expecting something livlier from the creator of the Razzies. Still, I enjoyed it, and would give it a nod because of the sheer number of bad movies it lists, and the information it gives. However if you are looking for less of a reference book and more of a humor book, you'll probably want to keep looking."
3,Shorts.,"Reiko Momochi, Confidential Confessions, vol. 4 (Tokyopop, 1998)This is the short-story volume of the series, with Momochi cramming four pieces into the space she usually uses for two. Despite the smaller real estate for each one, the stories follow the same path we're used to, and the themes aren't unfamiliar to those who've been following along the whole time; if you like the rest of the series, you'll like this one. ***"
3,"Dull story, interesting light on book collectors","Very pleasant insight into the world of book collectors and small press publishers. I enjoyed that very much, but the story itself is dull, predictable, and too long."
4,"Great song with an extra,,,","Great song and I bought this for the Hex Hector mix of Love On,,,,worth getting,,,,"
1,Beware,This... unit doesn't provide two important items: 1) Instructions for use with a DVD player. The word DVD does not appear anywhere in the instruction manual. Apparently it is not designed for use with DVD players. and 2) Recording from the cable input while viewing from another input source. The remote control doesn't have two important items: 1) An eject button. and 2) A jump station button.
5,Love this!!,One of the things I really love about this DVD is that it's only the two of them playing. They don't bring their buddies out to play keyboards and bass. I really dig that it's just the two of them. If you like The Black Keys... You'll love this!!
1,Soooo boring...,"I just thought James Getzlaff was such a cutie from the Boy Meets Boy show so I bought this. It is a camera in one room for the entire like hour and fifty minutes... It's so dull and boring. I'm not gonna keep going on about how bad this movie was, it just all together didn't work."
1,Rubbish!,"What outdated nonsense. Don't waste your time on this neo-liberal clap-trap.It would be laughable, if it weren't for the fact that so many people have already taken this vicious glorification of greed to heart.Strictly for those who have already drank their trickle-down Kool-Aid and what to assuage the guilt (and one assumes loneliness from living in their glorious self-fabricated ""society-less"" society) ."
1,Australian School of Economics at its Worst,Mr Hayek's cartoon entitled The Road to Serfdom is clearly a ripoff of Ayn Rand's very good Anthem. Why he was awarded the Nobel Prize is beyond me.Verdict: Silly in retrospect and totally unoriginal
3,"An Essential, if difficult, read","This epic academic work boils down to the pre-cursors and result of political power. Not easy reading (else I would give it more stars), but essential reading for any student of human behavior and how men use political power.Van Hayek saw firsthand the slide of well intentioned ""progressive"" thinking into controlling fascist dictates. The lessons learned are univeral because they are derived from human behavior. And since the events are two generations before ours, the reader can draw conclusions free from the coloration and rancor of personalities known in our time.Von Hayek notes the arrival of the ""progressive"" (socialist) age was heralded as the end of economic man. The reality on the end of economic man is more like the emperor's new clothes: the ""progressive"" era is ""a change in a state of affairs that never existed, to a direction in which we are not moving."""
3,Good for entertainment,"It is not a masterpiece, but I like the trilogy so far. Epic happenings and battles are always thrilling. But, I think it is too many battles in the book, as goes for many of the latest forgotten realms novelles. It is almost as if you haven't finished one battle until the next starts. The book is divided in three different sitings, and on every siting there is just as much battle as on the last. More intrigues, and insight in the villains minds could have made the book more interesting."
4,Fun book,"Action, dragons, all the things I enjoy plus a well done story. A good read for any fantasy reader.If you like books like this one, might I suggest another I've recently come across. The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. It's another fantasy adventure sure to please. I highly recommend it."
5,Save your money as these rechargeable D cells work great!,As advertised- MAHA D cell's hold a great long term charge especially if you can either ease the connection on the light you are using them with when not in use or maintain a constant connection and utilize the MAHA charger to keep a second set of MAHA D cell's ready to go. The charger accommodates AA through D cell rechargeable and is made in the USA- batteries as well!
2,"too breif, it assumes too much","if you already know these topics this might be a good book, but for those of us first learning it, this book is terrible, way to breif, and it assumes you know way more than you really do"
5,You get what you pay for!,"WeatherTech! What more can you say? I had the run of he mill Bug Deflector. I got a dealand when I got it,I got what I paid for,can I say it ""cheap crap"" WeatherTech is quality.Not only can you see, you can feel it. I intend to buy more WeatherTech products soon.I know what i'm getting is ""GOOD OLD USA MADE"".............Need I say more?"
3,same as older edition?,"I haven't bought this 7th edition of the book, but I have the older 3rd edition of it (dark green cover, published in 1999). But the ""look inside"" option showcases the older edition, making me wonder if there is ANYTHING that is new and updated in this, and if so, what that might be. I was hoping the topics would be tweaked a bit, articles included would be updated/more timely, etc...but you really can't tell that from the listing. bottom line is why would I spend more money on this if it's the just same as what I already have?"
3,Good mystery!,"Not as good as The Sixth Commandment, but still interesting. At times, seemed like too many characters and with 2 story lines going on - got confusing. Again, another likeable male lead character, Joshua Biggs. I think that's my favorite thing about Sanders' books - his descriptions of the characters are so vivid and realistic. Funny one-liners, too. Unlike Sanders' other stories, this one had a moving romance with well-written scenes - usually he doesn't get that ""mushy"" and I liked it!"
4,GARRISON HAD THE RIGHT IDEA,"It seems the majority of people dissing the book are the same ones who blame liberals for the evils of the world.About this book, I think Garrison was on the Right track ,but could have spent more time investigating the Dallas connection to the JFK assassination. He had some of the key players down, but spent too much time on Clay Shaw. Worth reading if you can still find a copy."
5,Best Bible Study of the Year 2012 SELAH Award,"Thanks for all the great reviews and comments. Just wanted to let you know that ""Joseph: Beyond the Coat of Many Colors"" won the 2012 SELAH Award for Best Bible Study of the Year from the Blue Ridge Mountain Christian Writers Conference! Mary Englund Murphy"
3,Farflung - 'Raven That Ate The Moon' (Flipside),"Looks to be Farflung's second release. Probably my LEAST favorite Farflung CD. There seems to be some confusion with the track listing. The back cover lists four cuts, but the CD player registers there to be six tunes. Plus, inside the insert, they mention credits for tracks number 7 and 8. Haven't been able to figure it out. Either way, it's an okay title of the band's trademark industrial sonic mayhem. Since it may be tough to access much info on this disc, I'll go ahead and list the four actual tunes with their running times. Track 1)""Raven That Ate The Moon"" (12:21), 2)""Sonic Evaporation"" (12:00), 3)""Helianthus"", ""(10:23) and the super-lengthy ""The Way The Sky Is"" (40:30)which after about sixteen minutes, it develops into some senseless circus-like psych. Check it out for yourself."
5,Direct equivalent for APC battery,"This is the exact RBC7 equivalent battery that APC offers. It doesn't have the APC label, and as another reviewer has noticed, the sticky tab on the bottom of the battery comes mounted opposite where APC would mount it. Not really a problem."
1,OUT OF DATE Lawbook = Dangerous!,"While we authors are honored that people are selling our used books -- in some cases for more than the original purchase price, which is beyond weird: anyone buying at those prices? -- an OUT OF DATE LAWBOOK is not only useless but dangerous. While some information is timeless, other information is just: WRONG. Laws and regulations have changed, on some matters of pharmacy practice quite dramatically, since this book was published, even since the final online update (no longer available) for the book. Would be great if Nothing Ever Changed, but it does (drives authors c-r-a-z-y). Wrong legal info is dangerous for practice, dangerous for taking the CPJE. Latest edition, the 7th, is available now, January 2012."
5,I Love Chocolate!,"I wanted to let you know I just finished reading the book. I couldn't wait to tell you that it had me smiling, cheering, and angry. I was happy that Nina got a man she could love and respect. I loved the fact that she and Kyle adopted Topaz's and Sean's love child. (I must admit, I was hoping it was Germain's, so they could live happily ever after.) Speaking of Topaz. What a ""bad"" girl. I couldn't believe she flirted with Sean even after she got back the man of her dreams. Keisha is the ""glue"" that holds these people together. I was glad she had a son to complete her happy family. And poor misunderstood Jade. If the girl had just gotten off her high horse and given Sean the ""TLC"" he wanted and so desperately needed, there never would have been...well you know. Anyway, I loved the book, and of course you left it open for another sequel. I CAN'T WAIT! Keep on doing what ya doing."
5,an essential for owners of pushrod motors,"I second everything the previous reviewer stated. a little more than a decade ago, this book was part of the curriculum for a cylinder head modification course I took under the tutelage of Bank's Turbochargers' lead man. the book is still serving me well as I strive to maintain my trusty MoPar smallblock.non-beginners can skip the opening with it's review of the basics of the pushrod motor, then the top end in closer detail. all but seasoned pros (who've probably already read this) however, will benefit from Barkhouse's explanations of theory, mechanical functions, diagnostics, troubleshooting, dis- and re-assembly, and modifications.this is a book that will be on my kid's shelves when they inherit my 'outdated' vehicles."
1,Poor,"This is a poorly written finance text. It is not organized and unclear in some sections. I have a degree in Finance, and I would never recommend this book to anyone."
3,A Tough Read,"I would have to agree with what others had to say about this book. It is dense and written in such an ""academic"" way, that Cramer could not understand what they are saying. To be sure, I am not a student but bought this as reference. The best part of the text is that it features lots of CFA type questions."
1,this is NOT an exact replacement,"This battery is 1/4"" taller than a real RBC6, so it won't fit in some APC UPS units! Don't be fooled!"
2,Dictionary,For what I paid for this book... I have to say that I was not expecting the binding to rip off.
1,Horrible Seller 0 stars,Item was never shipped. Seller does not respond to emails. Dispute was filed on this order. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!
3,The Very Best and Very Worst of the Residents,"Originally, this recording came in a plastic LP format, one side with the works of the late Hank Williams the other with the works of the late John Philip Sousa - the famous composer of marches, both as arranged and performed by the Residents.The Hank Williams side not only works, but is brilliant, and contains the absolute best work the Residents have ever done - at least as far as arranging others music. If you are to get this CD, get it for the Hank Williams stuff. ""Kaw-Liga"" was actually a hit single in Europe, something we may (unfortunately) never see again.The Sousa stuff doesn't even work for elevator music, and is best left to folks like me who'll be happy listening to the Residents snore or to listen to some obscure sound check done by them in gosh knows when, and gosh knows where.A good idea that didn't quite work."
3,One of the more proficient short-form horror films I've seen.,"The setup is intuitive -- we get right into it with a minimum of exposition -- and the taut recitation of the mirror's haunted history reminded me of Richard Johnson's rundown on Hill House in The Haunting. That said, it's not exactly scary and I found myself wishing that writer/director Flanagan had given himself another 10 minutes. Graham's final descent seems a bit too accelerated, the little set cluttered -- a more spartan approach would have been spookier (a la 2001) -- and, most of all, I wish Flanagan had resisted the temptation to ""monsterize"" his film. The mirror, the room, the cameras need to remain the monsters."
4,A Million Dollar Contest...,"When the answers to a million dollar contest disappear with a man's wallet you have trouble. When the man is also dead you have murder. Sounds simple? Not in a Rex Stout mystery. Five missing answers and five people who wanted those answers. Think that makes it simple? No, not at all. Only Nero Wolfe can solve this crime but can he solve it and still get paid? Ah, that's the rub.Good but not as good as some of the books. Really no hook to keep you reading and some parts feel almost boring. Sad. A good book but not a brilliant one. Get is used."
4,Me senté y lloré,"Es una linda historia, auque por un momento se pasa por una parte retorica, el fin vale la pena.Es la historia de un amor perdido y recuperado, un amor que no se apaga, pase lo que pase...es el sentimiento de amar y aunque los personages no son muy jovenes, es increible saber que el amor puede y perdura..y que a pesar de todo el amor hace sufrir...."
2,I don't like it smell,"I got in on time but I don't like it smell. I ordered it to try it because I read that combination with mix of roses, musk and others."
3,Bigger and thinner than expected.,"While this earring looks pretty, it's much thinner, lighter and bigger than it seems in the picture, so I'm don't wear them much. I should have returned them, but they were a gift."
3,THERE'S A HOLE IN MY OZONE,"RECIPE FOR LOW BUDGET DISASTER MOVIE:Take one brilliant scientist who detects a cataclysmic hole in the ozone but no one believes him;Add a corporate exec who thinks he has a better solution;Mix in the genius' estranged wife and teen daughter who thinks he doesn't pay them enough attention;A dash of the dedicated assistant who suffers from diabetes and unrequited love for the doctor;Place all ingredients in a fog shrouded enclosure and freeze for 90 minutes.As in most ""cautionary"" tales, man conquers the elements. ARCTIC BLAST is okay but nothing extraordinary. Acting is average and the fog is fluffy if not especially ominous. If you don't expect too much, you shouldn't be disappointed."
5,Great construction,"These shears are great. They're not fancy, just single-piece steel with molded plastic handles, but they are razor sharp, and will cut long grass around shrubberies much better than the home-center varieties. An adjustable pivot allows good control of the blades. Time will tell if they stay sharp and are easily resharpened, but I don't foresee any problems."
2,How much can you endure?,"O.K., There is no doubting that Suicide was a big influence on what would happen in the early 80's. I don't think people were pissed of with them for lack of guitars or drums. It was simply more of a provocative endurance test where the artistic statement became more important than music. I love Captain Beefheart and The Residents and such. But Suicide (along with Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music) is just not that much fun to listen too unless you need bragging rights for just being able to endure the pain that this record dishes out."
5,Brilliant but Underappreciated,"I first heard this album 5-6 years, and I thought to myself ""This pretty lame. What do people like about this?"" I listened to it again a couple of year later, and I was blown away. Two guys, one with a menacing vocal presence and another with synthesizers that sound like they were bought at a yard sale, pulled off an incredible album with this one. It's absolutely incredible what a singer and a guy with old synthesizers can do. The music is spare, dark, edgy, and even pretty scary sometimes. The song Frankie Teardrop is legendary not only for its subject matter but also, in my opinion, the scariest visceral screams that any singer has produced. All the other songs are also great. The music pulsates and Vega interjects with singing and screams throughout the album. Absolutely incredible! If you're a fan of post-punk bands like Joy Division, you'll love this album. If you don't like punk or post-punk, you still may be pleasantly surprised."
5,Surf Punk Deluxe,Excellent return to form. This band is still out there playing! They personify the O.C. sound!
1,Keep Your Day Job,"It's a good thing Judy Collins can sing, 'cause she sure can't write! Dull, boring, redundant, and infantile."
1,Poor packaging,"Firstly I'd like to state that the quality of the ""Stargate Atlantis"" series is very good and I am a big fan,the reason I gave this product such a poor rating is because the product packaging is poor and damages the DVD discs.I tried watching one of the discs and the first disc out of the box did'nt work, so to anyone who is a Stargate andwatch a copy of the series to watch I recommend buying the DVDs or boxset instead."
2,Overpriced,This Boxed set is priced on Amazon for 179.99 but the individual seasons from Amazon are cheaperSeason 1 $29.99Season 2 $38.49Season 3 $33.49Season 4 $32.49Season 5 $16.99---------------Total $151.45What could the boxed set have that's worth an extra 28.54
2,Don't buy this set. Buy the individual seasons.,"I bought this set (not on Amazon). It was horrible. One disc didn't play at all and several had episodes that skipped or parts of them were not there in the first place. I love this show! IMO it is the best sci-fi show to have aired on SYFY. Better than SG-1 and way better than Universe. If you like science fiction, drama and comedy rolled all into one get SGA, only do it with the individual seasons. P.S. Don't hold your butt waiting for the promised movie, cuz it ain't happening. Star Gate Atlantis 5+++ stars, packaging 2 stars."
5,Nicely surprised,"After reading other reviews, I was not sure what to expect but was nicely surprised. The packaging is user friendly and all the DVD's were in perfect condition. I love the extras on the bonus disc as well as all the commentaries. Yes I listen to them because I like to hear all the things that went on in the filming."
4,Problem with Season 5 Disc 4,"I recently watched the episode ""Vegas"" which is on Disc 4 of Season 5, and at about 8.55 into the episode the picture breaks up into square pixels.I already replaced this set once already and it seems its a master flaw on the same disc."
5,Excellent series,"I still hate the fact that they cancelled this show for SGU. However, I am glad I have this on bluray so I can watch it forever! It also looks a lot better than the Netflix version! Excellent series, thanks. Now if they could do something with SG1!"
1,cheap,great series but cheap packaging wish i knew had crappy packaging would not have bought; will have to buy dvd cases to put in or have to replace the dvds eventuallyStargate Atlantis: The Complete Series Collection
2,Could have been better,"I tried this game, and it makes the Game Gear Version look a whole lot better. In the GG version, you actually walk around the casino to the different games. You go to the ATM for money. and there is Video Horse Racing. I am glad i picked up the GG version at [the store] than wasting my money on the GBA version."
4,A little far-fetched in some places but overall a pretty interesting read,"I agree with another reviewer that Maxie frequently acts really stupid - I kept thinking, why doesn't she go to the police? Well she finally does, but then more things happen and since she thinks she probably can't reach the exact same officers she spoke to before, she doesn't call them again. That and some other parts of the story were a bit far-fetched, especially the reason why the bad guys were after her, but it still was pretty interesting. Probably too much description of Hawaii, but actually we just went to the Big Island a few months ago and it was fun to read about the same places we went. Overall I enjoyed this book quite a bit and would recommend it."
3,maix and stretch on the road again in this mystery,yet another installment of the maxie and stretch hystory. Maxie has friends in Hawaii and she takes to the road in borrowed RV to explore the islands and of course finds mystery. another engaging book in this series.
2,change your life,An aspiring disc jockey and an aspiring comedian find their comfortable relationship becomes quite stormy when they get their big change to pursue their dreams
4,Amazon brings Canasta back,"After 30 years of not playing Canasta, a group of us senior citizens got interested again, but couldn't find any canasta cards with points. . . so, on the computer we went. There Amazon was with everything we needed. We now have a weekly game, complete with nice cards, tray and shuffler from Amazon. I was amazed how fast we received our order. Thank you."
5,Details on Tiffany lamp construction,"I've looked around a lot for a good stained glass lamp construction book, and I've finally found this one. It is excellent. It covers all the steps, from the basic cutting and soldering, to the more advanced mold making, and shop setup - even convers public health issues. Really worth it."
2,Terrifying,"We bought this for our daugher when she was 1 and put it on the proper setting. The first time the head popped up, she screamed in terror. I put in on the 4 month old setting and she played with it a little but overall is still terrified of it. Every once in a while we pull it out to see if she will play with it because I really think it is a neat toy and she just runs screaming from the room. I would give it away if I knew of anyone with a baby but I dont. It seems a shame to let it sit there collecting dust. We had it almost a year befor I even knew that the shapes came out."
4,Better Fiction Than Truth,"Verily, it is said that thou art not supposed to take this literally. The stories of the Creation, the Flood, Moses' parting of the Red Sea, etc. etc. art symbolical of more profound Truths. Forsooth what cranktwaddle this be! The scribes who first penned the ""Words of God"" upon the vellum and parchment intended each word to be taken verily in its literal sense, since when the alchemists and scientists have made great sport with such assertions that the World was created in Seven Days. As a view of the Universe, thou art ill advised to put much trust in this odd buke, but if thou carest to beguile a few hours with phiction and phancy, then I recommendest it highly to thee."
5,Sound Decision,"This book is an excellant starter for learning electric guitar. The music disc really helps in bringing the sound and book lessons together. I am still learning, but with the layed out weekly lessons, it makes it much easier to stay on track. The book certainly makes it much easier, but like anything else, it still just comes down to practice."
2,Pirated book-copyright violation-buyer BEWARE!!!!,"Very disappointed to get this book which has no bar code and clearly appears to be ""home project"" of copyright violation: Poorly bound with delayed delivery. As a collector of books, any one would be disappointed to get this wreck of disjointedly bound, unauthentic appearing copy of a book. I have contacted the publisher to investigate a possible copyright violation. It is a shame that Amazon.com is the cybervehicle of such books!"
3,Rumble in the Bay,"Classical late 60's / early 70's flick with a heavy randomness to it, not really any storyline. The bikes are cool; The Hells partying and fighting seemed like forced action, but probably generally reflective of the types of things that took place.Couple of points: the other review above says Sonny Barger is in the movie, but only for a couple of quick shots in the opening. The lead (playing Sonny/type) is WAY too sensitive a guy to be realistic (IMHO). The ending is comically abrupt and odd. Plus the factory version I bought was tapped in EP - THE WORST possible quality and horribly grainy - difficult to watch since the reproduction was so bad. It was still kinda fun as an era piece."
1,why has my shipment been delayed. This was a birthday gift but now I am cancelling the order. Your efficiency sucks,why has my shipment been delayed. This was a birthday gift but now I am cancelling the order. Your efficiency sucks
4,Good Book No Clue On What To Think,Although I only got to like the 8th chapter because I didnt start in time to finish it before my report was due I still really enjoyed the book. But I would have to say I had no thought about it not being real. But oh well. I still think it was really good and hope that he wouldnt make stuff up like that.
1,truth stranger than fiction,"Stranger than the tale in this book is the actual story of Mike Warnke. Check out the ""Selling Satan"" book from Cornerstone Press. It is well-documented, proving that ""The Satan Seller"" is a fictional work from the mind of Warnke. Read all about Mike's post-crusade parties, celebrating all of the money he fleeced from the flock. Mike: The ""Milli Vanilli"" of ""Christian"" Comedy."
1,Propaganda ( Because we'll believe ANYTHING!),"Completely debunked, Satan Seller is a fine testament to what we can be led to believe. My favorite chapter included an episode of a coven member materializing from thin air to tell Warnke their meeting time had changed. She couldn't call?This sort of trash gave us equally debunked moral panics like the ridiculous Satanic Panic of the 80's. Too bad so many people had their lives ruined before we came to our senses. (Read Remembering Satan)The Satan Seller uses as its selling point a constant message about spiritual warfare and being wary. Faith based in fear. Fear has been used to keep the congregation in line since the first stones were stacked to build a temple. Satans and devils and demons? How believable is all this? Do we ever stop to think how downright silly this is? Why not goblins and elves? Oh right, that's just dumb."
1,...,"HOW anyone could find this hateful book enlightening in this day is beyond me. I personally think that Warnke, if anyone, is the Satan seller.This book is hysterical and inacurate. It is a deep insult to the Pagan community--and in essence is also detrimental to Christianity as well. Please...be INFORMED before making a decision one way or another on this piece of work (and ultimately) this issue. Wiccans/Pagans/Witches/et all do not WANT to convert people--but we DO want to be allowed freedom of religion. Everyone deserves that. Warnke has all but been proven a liar, if you don't believe me, check out the evidence, then decide."
2,"Pack of lies, but a good read","I remember reading this in high school, and I bought it hook line and sinker. It was disappointing when I found out Warnke had been lying all of this time, I had seen one of his videos talking about his satanic experiences, it had left quite an impression on me. But looking back, it's hard to believe that we could have ever believed this nonsense, now that I think about it as an adult, it was all really too ridiculous to believe. I still slightly recommend it because it's well written horror fiction, a very scary read, just read it as a novel."
2,Automatic Wealth CD,"The product which I received was blank.I was quite disappointed.The company resent another Cd out and now it works.Amazon was very prompt in making sure to send out a new one.Thank you,Danny Bernal"
2,Needlessly complex,"I had to buy this book for Business Statistics, and some of the homework problems are poorly written. One particular example is when the book asks for the ""percentile ranking for the age of 25 years in the distribution of all ages of licensed drivers stopped by the police."" All they wanted you to do was take the full 100 percent and subtract it by the number they give you, but the way they word it makes it seem like you need magic powers to divide the percentage of people stopped based on their ages.My professor said having the last two chapters on the CD is done to save printing costs. I dread to think of how expensive this book would be (at the actual college bookstore) if the last two chapters were included in the book."
4,Wonderful Introductory Text,"Often using real-life examples taken from the media, McClave presents materials in an orderly fashion. Sub-sections are small (usually 5-6 pages) and problem sets are very nicely divided into Mechanics, Basic, and Advanced problems. My only dislike was chapter 3 counting rules, which seemed to be added without proper foundation. As both a student and now a tutor of this text, I find McClave's level of explanation sufficent for an introductory text."
1,Not used by my Professor,"My teacher only uses this for homework, so I sold the book to a friend, and piggy backed off another friend. Too expensive."
5,Looks Great,"I haven't played the game yet, but I do think that by the way people are talking about it, this game is great. I had sonic adventure on Sega Dreamcast and the graphics are amazing and 3D and I am sure that nothing can come close to that like this can. I still think that it is a little unfair that you can only play with your chao if you have a gamecube becuase some of us dont have one but this game looks cool and a BIG thanx to the creators of this game for taking the character ""BIG"" out of the game."
5,Blast from the past,"I have had every sonic game ever in stores and all were a blast. I remember playing sonic on my sega when I was smaller then today, but to be able to play it on a handheld system and take it with me in a car or at a soccer game makes it even better. I also can't wait till sonic comes out on gamecube. All in all it is a great game where the fun never ends for me, and I trust a lot of people do and don't feel the same way.-Brandon Widder"
2,PRETTY COOL DUDE,YO man i thought after buyin sonic games for dreamcast it would be better. its almost identical to the genisis version as well. if ur lookin for a real good game this isnt for u. buy somethin like golden sun or dbz:legecy of goku. maybe its me i like rpgs better. but this games not as good as nintendo could of made it. im a skater who likes rpg's and instant messanger.PPPPPPPEACE OOOOOOOOOOOOUT!!!
4,A Masterful power Metamnl Albumn,"This new project from Hansi Kursh and John Schaffer is awsome; with all the hype about black and death metal (which I love), its great to see a new power metal release that combines the savage brutality of Iced Earth and the epic melody of Blind Guardian."
2,JUST OK,"The music is cool! But those vocals are horrible! Man with some killer singing, I would love It! song writing is cool."
5,Genius,"THE BEST METAL CD EVER, PERIOD. This CD is pure genius and if you don't buy it your a moron that doesn't know what real metal is. Every last song is perfect."
1,Why all this claptrap against postmodernism?,"Above all, postmodernism worships the god of the free market. Right wingers should be happy."
3,A BIT SLOW BUT STILL TERRIFYING,TODAY WAS THE FIRST TIME I EVER WATCHED THIS FILM/I HAVE PUT IT OFF FOR YEARS CUZ DIDNT THINK I WOULD LIKE IT THAT MUCH/FOR THE MOST PART I FELT THE MOVIE PLAYED OUT AS LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRARIE UNTIL THE DOG MADE HIS FIRST KILL BUT THAT WAS 45 MINUTES INTO THE MOVIE/HOWEVER WHEN BOTH MOMMY AND SON ARE STUCK IN THE CAR THERE ARE SOME VERY INTENSE SCENES WHICH WILL MAKE YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE GO UP AND MAKE YOU JUMP/WHAT MADE THIS TERRIFYING WERE THE CAMERA ANGLES AND GREAT ACTING ON BOTH PART OF THE MOM AND SON/ALSO I DONT KNOW HOW THEY GOT THAT DOG TO PERFORM SO REALLISTICALLY AS TO BE RABID (GOOD JOB)/I READ THE PREVIOUS REVIEW WHERE SOMEONE NOTED THAT IT LOOKED THE THE CHILD WAS ACTUALLY SCARED THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE EATEN/I BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE WITH THE MOM ALSO/NOT A GREAT MOVIE BUT VERY ENJOYABLE
4,Movie vs. Book,I enjoyed reading the book. Most movies made from popular books take too many liberties with the acutal story in order to get it on film and maintain an audience. Tough changes were made here also I enjoyed the movie overall. It took a second viewing to accept the ending in the movie which drastically changed from the book. Both are enjoyable to read or view and would reccomend them to anyone who enjoys horror and Stephen King!
3,Bad dog!,"Cujo is one scary film! It doesn't help that I have a fear of crazy dogs, this movie leaves nothing to the imagination. Cujo is a St. Bernard who has been bitten by a bat and now has rabies, that explains his grotesque behavior. A mother and son are trapped in their tiny car and that insane Cujo wants to rip them to shreds. This film is based on Stephan King's novel, good film but kinda silly. It's a mixed bag for me."
4,"Good movie, but freaking scary!!!","A nice gentle st. bernard get's bitten by a bat with rabies. Between the scenes with Donna and Vic, the scenes with Cujo being pre rabid keep you on your toes. And when he does go nuts, it's scary. After killing 2 people, he goes after Donna and Tad. I found myself hiding everytime it showed a shot with Donna and Tad in the car. All in all, it's an ok film with a scary plot. (Cujo looks scary too)"
3,Good Dog Gone Bad...,"Big dog chases bunny. Bunny runs into hole. Big dog sticks nose in hole. Bat bites big dogs big nose. Horror results. CUJO is the tale of a poor St. Bernard who contracts rabies, causing him to kill and kill again. Dee Wallace Stone (The Howling, The Hills Have Eyes) is menaced, along with her son. They are trapped in their car by the huge, slobbering beast! Watch Cujo hurl himself at the car! See him covered in bloody foam and dirt! Sort of a hairy, land-locked version of JAWS. While the first 2/3 of the film are slow-going, the finale' is worth the wait! Not for the squeemish pet owner! No real Cujos were harmed during the making of this movie..."
4,Pretty good.,"This movie had the scares, the suspense, and the acting, so I can't see why you haven't seen this yet. Buy or rent and watch alone in the dark."
2,This dog is too cute to be vicious,"...and that's all I'm gonna say about this movie. I have always had a hard time hating the dog or being scared of it. It looks too cuddly and cute. You can totally tell that it is just sitting there, being told to grunt, but that in real, all he wants is just a bone and a hug. They should have picked something like a black Doberman or something or some other kind of beast. But a little cute Saint Bernhard? Speaking of miscasting for a role. I really wanted to like this movie, but because of their choice of dog I couldnt and if anything, it just upset me to see this dog be artificially made to look evil and be all bruised etc. The whole time I was thinking ""awww"". So good idea, wrong dog. If the audience wants to schmuse with it, it will not be scared of it."
4,Great!,"This movie has a LOT of action, quality is great, story is a little boring (hence the 4 stars) but, after all, it's about the IP Man and his legendary battles...watch it now!"
1,Disappointed,I had high hopes for this movies. I mean the first two about Ip Man were great... so I really expected this one to at least compare to those ones. But there is no climax... there's just pretty much the same tone throughout the whole thing.
4,it's a hook,it's a hook. what else is there to say. I got what I anticipated.more words to get to 20
5,A great help!,I have a female GSD whose coat was dry and flat. I started her on Nupro and within two weeks began to see marked improvements. She has been on it for 6 months now and looks great. She hardly sheds at all now (and for a GSD that's saying a lot!). I'll continue to use this product without hesitation.
4,A mixed bag of 70's classics,"From the highly recognizable (Maxine Nightingale, The Sylvers, Rick Springfield and others) to the obscure (Hotlegs and Flash), this collection covers a lot of 70's music territory. The hits are certainly here, as well as the misses (Moon Martin's ""Rolene"" peaked at #30 in Oct. 79 and Desmond Child & Rouge ""Our Love is Insane"" made it to #51 in March of 79), even a song some radio stations wouldn't play because it was a little too depressing. No, not Robert John's ""Sad Eyes"", but Bloodrock's ""D.O.A."" Frankly, my favorite song on this record is not a chart topper by any means, but it's one of the reasons I picked up this collection - ""Saturday Morning Confusion"" by Bobby Russell. And it's cool to break out your air drums for Cozy Powell too. A definite must-have for your 70's music collection."
2,Conquest,The conquest album is an below average Heep album. It lacked alot. The replacement for David Byron on this album was sub-par.
4,Mucha clase y buen gusto,"Juan Perro (Santiago Auserón) es uno de los músicos españoles con las ideas más claras. Sus discos siempre convencen, y ""Cantares de Vela"" no es una excepción. Ahora se acerca al jazz y al soul, y desde luego no es el primer rockero que lo hace, pero sí uno de los pocos que no ha fracasado en el intento. La clase de Auserón está presente en temas como el precioso ""No más lágrimas"", el jazzero ""Apaga la Vela"", ""Sólo El Vino"", con un toque muy soul, y en la exquisita y magnifíca ""La Misteriosa"", en mi opinión el mejor momento del disco. Este trabajo tiene el sabor de lo clásico, de esas canciones que uno intuye que se recordarán siempre. Aún así, algunos temas como ""El Cigarrito"" o ""No Me Conoces"" no me terminan de convencer, de ahí que sólo le de 4 estrellas. En cualquier caso, ""Cantares de Vela"" es un disco excepcional, algo poco común en la escena musical española de la actualidad."
3,It does satisfy your sweet cravings,"If you eat three or four of them, otherwise nothing. I'm a huge fan of Hoodia but these really didn't help."
3,Oooooh.... who lives in a Game Boy under the sea?,"This is a great game. It has pretty good graphics and cool sounds... but I beat this game in 2 days. And I'm thinking that anyone who is an andvanced video game player could beat this in 30 minutes. But for some reason, it's fun to play over and over again. I recommend this game for Spongebob fans or someone that's looking for a good GBA game to start out with. But all those hardcore gamers who like lengthy, adventurous games, this is not for you. This game is worth 3 stars which is average. I rate games thinking: 3 stars is average, 4 stars is above average, 5 stars is perfect, 2 stars is below average, and 1 star is, well, 1 star."
5,Spongebob Advancepants,much better than the gameboy color game of spongebob. you would play it over and over till your hands hurt.
5,it makes cooking fun!,"i've been using it for a month or so, and it works great for me -- perfect size to cook meal for 3-5 servings (and +- 2 servings), easy to clean, very aesthetic on gas stove. The best pot i've ever owned!"
2,very dated,"This book has some good ideas, but it is very dated. It refers to search engines and sites that no longer exist, and doesn't address new technologies and sites. A new edition might be worthwhile, but I'd pass on this one."
2,Don't mess with a classic..stick with the metro!,"I bought this CD for one reason: to get the metro mix of ""Not a girl, not yet a woman."" Personally I never liked the original of that song, but the remix is great, perfect for summer. The other tracks...simply [is bad]. To do a cover of a rock classic like ""I love rock'n'roll"" when you're a cheesy pop singer just isn't right. And Rodney Jerkins remix of ""Overprotected"" is awful! The original is waaay better even if her vocals are too whiney, but on the remix her voice just sounds even more worse! So in conclusion, I probably spent a little more money on this CD than I originally wanted too, but the metro remix is just too beautiful..."
2,Strap keeps falling down,"The strap provides good comfort on the shoulder, however it is loosely fixed and will shift easily down the strap. If it had a rubberized sheath it would hold up better."
5,5 on AB exam,"Stephen's daughter Amanda says- I found this book two months before the AP Calculus AB exam. It really helped me to review the concepts our class had gone over earlier in the year. It was easy to understand, and I found the step-by-step solutions to be very useful. I ended up scoring a 5 on the AP Calc AB exam. If you are planning on taking the AB exam, I think this book will really help you!"
1,Big Hit of the 50's,"This would be a fantastic CD. The chosen tracks are great. BUT - The sound quality if terrible! The whole CD sounds like (if any of you are old enough to remember - the old 78 records) very scratchy throughout. I sent it back and Amazon sent me a new one which sounded the same. They graciously credited my account.At their suggestion, I then ordered from one of their outside sellers, Import CD's, (my choice of seller) and the CD sounded the same. Amazon thought that maybe it was their own shipment that was defective. I have requested Import CD's to reply to my request to send it back and after 10 days I still have not heard from them. I did inform Amazon 2 days ago but have not heard from them regarding this seller either. Needless to say I am very disappointed. I would love to have this CD IF I could find one that was not defective."
4,Works better than I had expected,"Using the Leapfrog to split up signal from hi-def satellite receiver, I was thrilled to see how great the signal looked on other TVs throughout the house, (NOTE: signal will not NOT be hi-def, you need to use the downconverted RCA outputs). The range is surprisingly good, upstairs, the basement, it even worked on a TV outdoors! My 2.4Ghz phone interfered initially whenever I'd get a call, but seletecing a different channel on the Leapfrog transmitter and recievers completely eliminated the problem.Colors look great and detail is sharp on all channels, however the luminance can be a bit ""hot"", particularly from hi-def signals.I did not try the remote control extension option, as my receiver uses RF remotes, so it wasn't necessary. For a DVD player or VCR, this would probably be a good option to use.All in all, if you have a single video source for the TV and want to see it throughout your home without wires, Leapfrog sure worked great for me!"
1,"Low Quality, Low Quality, Low Quality","I bought this for my mom who wanted to hook up her TV in the bedroom to her satellite TV without running a new wire. The distance from the transmitter to the receiver was well within the specified range, but the sound and video quality we absolutely terrible. I read the other reviews, but sometimes people's experiences are different, so I figured I would give it a try. One sure thing about Amazon.com,. if one is dissatisfied, they take good care of you with their return policy.While I regret buying the product because it did not work as advertised, I DO NOT regret ordering through Amazon.com because they really take care of their customers."
1,Does not work at all,After hooking up this item we discovered that it did not work at all. No video or audio came through. We returned the item.
2,Range less than advertised.,"This was purchased with the intent of using it to transmit the video signal from one of our cable boxes to a projector on our patio. I tested the product first with the devices in the same room and had no issues. When I moved the receiver outside, I was unable to get a reliable picture and audio was awful. The receiver was less than 60 feet from the transmitter, and the advertised range was up to 150 feet. Overall, I would say that this product may be useful if you want to put a TV away from the cable box in the same room, but will not be reliable for transmitting A/V for longer distances or through walls."
1,Does not work with Dish Network 311 Receiver,I was not able to get it to control my Dish Network 311 receiver. Even placed sender/receiver in same room and it was unable to even turn it on or off. The audio and video quality was great with the unit in the basement and the tv up on the second floor. Too bad the IR didn't work so I'm doing the RMA with amazon.
2,item could use some improvement,"I am sending it back today. If you have a cordless phone, chances are strong that you will not be happy with this product. After 2 hours of trying everything, I did get a clear picture, but needed to be standing away from the unit.The signal is adequate for rooms that are in close proximity, but even testing the unit out 6 feet away, I experienced a loss of picture quality. If you don't mind lines of static, or have a phone that is not on this frequency, maybe it will work for you.For me...I will find a way to install a wire."
4,Satellite customer,"This product works as advertised, though you cannot change the channels on the receiving TV. I've had this product for 6 months and I am sufficiently pleased with it's performance. There are times when static interference occurs but just move the unit around a bit and it usually clears up."
3,Wont Work so far....,"Arrived on time with all the parts, no manual to put it together so It could be me? I am giving it 3 stars because I am not sure if item does not work or its just me. Seems easy enough to set up, but running from TV to TV and testing A/B/C/D options does not make it easy. Maybe someone might have a suggestion. Do I go into TV options? (I did that, but choose auto programming....is that wrong??) Should I call Comcast for help? reboot cable box or receivers after hook up? Both TV's are brand new. I am trying to search for help online and will give an update later. I have to contact the seller as well. Wish me luck.."
2,Meh,"Poor range and reception, easily interfered with by WiFi signals and cordless home phones. It works well when it works but small amounts of interference ruin it."
4,Works great for me,"I installed this product in about 10 minutes and that included cleaning up the wiring. The transmitter is in one room and the receiver in another. There is no line of sight between them. Even with the bedroom door closed, it still works great. Only when one person stands in front of the receiver will it start to lose reception. I was able to send back my cable box which was in the bedroom previously, so this until will pay off in 2-3 months.One caveat: I have no wireless phones other than cell. But one of my neighbors must because when they are on the phone, my reception is messed up. But it doesn't happen very often. Also, the microwave will affect the unit. Again, very minor issue.I highly recommend."
2,This item has terrible instructions and difficult to use,"This item has terrible instructions on how to install it and we cannot get it to work properly. It needs to have diagrams showing exactly what part of the item they are talking about. If you have any more detailed instructions, please email them to me at: betsy.cohen@albrechtco.com."
2,Did Not Work 30 Feet Through 1 Wall,"I set this up in my kitchen and the best picture I could get was black/white and grainy with bad sound quality. This device does not seem to penetrate walls well at all. If you need to go through walls, watch out. I should have opted for a better device."
3,Only works for a little over the one year warranty,"We have had two sets of these and both worked wonderfully....for just over a year each. Then we found ourselves having to change channels to get the picture to stop jumping. Then they died. The first time, we gave it the benefit of the doubt. This time.....not sure we will be buying this particular device again."
1,JUNK,It is junk nothing but junk it took forever to get and when I did get It It would not work It's nothing but junk.
2,audio transmission failed in 1 year,The transmitter only transmits one channel of audio after 1 year of use
1,Directions do not address my situation,"I have a Direct TV receiver. I want to transmit this signal to another TV . The directions that come with the Leap Frog assumes that I will have the standard in/out RCA jacks on the back of my receiver. Well, I don't. I have jacks that say AV1 and AV2. And I have an old TV with no jacks. The ad said I could use this product with a TV of any age.The directions that come with the Leap Frog to not address this situation at all. A google search was not helpful and there was no technical information on the Terk web site. I tried a few different things, but than I thought- Hey- why bother? There is probably a way that this would work but I have better fish to fry. Back to the seller it goes."
4,helping you decide to buy this or not,"This game is awsome and I do recomend this, but if you are above the rookie stage it is almost impossible to even make a first down. I give this a four because the new playstation 2 is about better graphics, and this game has awsome graphics!"
5,This game is da best,"This game is so sweet. You can get madden cards and use them to access secret teams, stadiums, and historic players such as Dan Marino. You can even create a team and start a franchise. You can control this team for up to 30 years. The graphics are great, as most have come to expect from the Madden series. You can even create your own coach!"
4,Not as groundbreaking as I'd hoped...,"Madden 2002 is more of the ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" philosophy from the good folks at EA Sports. If you've played 2001, you'll feel right at home. Don't get me wrong, it is without a doubt the best football game out there, but I think a lot of us were expecting more from this game. The AI is marginally better, but the computer still has a knack for completing 5 passes in a row in triple coverage with no problem. Where this game really shines is the depth. I love franchise mode, where you can build a dynasty and have control over just about every aspect. You can even import a draft class from NCAA 2002 (great game)! The scary look in players' eyes is modified (thank God), but I wish the graphics were better. I've seen better graphics on the PC, and I'd have hoped the PS2 could match them. All in all, I definitely recommend Madden 2002, although if you're short on cash and have 2001, it may not be worth it."
3,"this is great, but ncaa is better","I admit, Madden is a great game, but ncaa football 2002 is better. ncaa football 2002 has EXACT same game gameplay except it has dynasty mode, it has SO many more teams, and it shows mascots. hey, but I admit, madden 2002 is a superb game. If you like pro football, definetely get this game. Or if You do not like college football, get madden."
2,Wake Up Madden,I've alway's been a Madden fan until last year when I played the NFL2K1. I bought the Madden 2001 and played it. It was alright but it was just lacking something. I bought the Madden 2002 and it's the same thing. Madden is boring and unrealistic. EA Sports does to much of the graphic BS and to less of realistic football. I bought the NFL2K2 by sega also and if you like football games I promise you you won't be able to put this one down. The players movements are much more realistic than Maddens and the game play is much better than Madden. I don't know if I'll ever buy another Madden game after playing Sega's sports lineup. All the Sega sports games have been better than any others that I have played on the playstation 2.
3,"Good, but needs improvement","When i first saw the ads for Madden 2002, i like everyone else, was very pumped about it and couldn`t wait to play. Well i`ve had the game for a few months and i have mixed feelings about. I think it`s much better visually than the previous Madden games, but it has some major flaws that makes the game a disappointment like the difficulty with the passing game and the apparent lack of speed. I`m very disappointed that EA Sports would allow these flaws to be on the final product. Hopefully they`ll fix these problems for Madden 2003."
5,BEst Football GAME,5 STARS I THINK THAT IS ALL I NEED TO SAY. GRAPHICS ARE AWESOME AND AMAZING STATS. IT IS TO GOOD TO PUT IN WORDS.
1,They really missed it,This could be a nice product. It is expensive enough to make me think lots of positive things about the product and the company. The disposer did not have all of the parts included. The missing part is one that is installed at the factory and is not sold separately. A week has passed since I called the Customer Support at InSinkErator. The initial promise was to send me the part FED EX two day delivery. I called again on Wednesday and I could not get any information from the Customer support person other than the problem was logged in. No shipping date nor carrier was available. This is very frustrating that they would let a product ship with out proper quality control and now be so unresponsive after their mistake.
4,Good and quiet,"When I got this, I never put one in before. The instruction for installation where easy to use. its much bigger then the old one i had. so a few modifications where needed. When I finished, I had to try it out. Dropped a potato in and it was gone instantly. so quiet too."
5,Very Quiet,Installation was easy. installation manuals were clear and precise. Loved it. The operation very is smooth and quiet. Awesome Product!
5,Great book 20 years ago - still a great book!!,"I bought this book when it was first published. There is a reason WHY it is still in print after 20 years!This is an incredible book. I used it for years designing sweater patterns I sold to yarn companies and magazines. Everything you need to know about fitting, shaping, and designing sweaters is here, even when writing a pattern with multiple sizes. I treasure this book and am delighted to see it is still available."
2,"Plot, Admittedly an Optional Literary Device, Is Helpful","I loved Catch-22 so I read this book as well. Unfortunately, the passage of time is quite apparent in the work product of the author. It is true that ""Picture This"" is full of witty insights into history. But the plot feels forced, the comedic timing is off, and in the end, the book seems like a hodge-podge of ""gee wiz, that sure makes ya THINK about things"" types of statements. I think it's a safe bet that anyone who reads this novel has gotten there by way of Catch-22. This was also the case when ""Picture This"" was released. Something more is needed to justify the book's 351 pages in hardcover besides basic assurances that ""the world is f****d up."" You're better off just reading your copy of Catch-22 again. The theme is basically the same (absent the rant against money, which is poorly defended), except conveyed through characters that the reader actually cares about."
1,A vast disappointment,"There are a lot of things I did expect when starting that ""novel"". A plot was one of them, some of the famous Heller wit another (this book really is unfunny, but keeps winking at you as if you're just a tiny little bit away from getting some cosmic joke it really is about). I didn't expect to be treated to a 326 page long variation of Larry King's obnoxious observations in USA Today, set in ancient Greece and Holland of the 16th/17th century. The chronology is totally mucked up, it seems not because of some artitistic reason, but because it was cobbled together without any sense of structure.Finally, an author who seriously suggests that some of the dutch provinces are perhaps not even known to many INSIDE the Netherlands (hey Joe: this isn't the US you're writing about) doesn' instill too much confidence about getting his other facts right.One of the few books in my life I didn't finish (maybe the second half is a LOT better)."
3,Ok video card on the cheap,this video card is ok for a cheap office computer that does light task and will get you buy with some older games like old copies of Tetris but don't expect it to blow you out the water i made a cheap office computer for my mother with it on a budget and it works for her and her needs surfing the web and the like
5,The Hindu Times = The Best of Times,"The Hindu Times restores my faith that rock and roll still exists. With all of the hoopla surrounding this boyband/teeny bopper/ rap craze in American Pop Culture, it's nice to know that there is at least one band out there who is dedicated in putting out pure rock and roll music. Listeners won't be dissapointed for the long-awated new single, in fact they will be left wanting more. And they'll get it - In July when the fifth studio album titled Heathen Chemistry is released."
3,Good but will the album be the same?,HINDU TIMES caught my attention when I heard it on TOP OF THE POPS a week ago. Turned me around when I realized it was Oasis. Somehow the hook reminded me more of a Soup Dragons song from about ten years ago or that LA pre-grunge band...forgot their name....instead of the Beatles.
4,Strong 30 Years Later,"If you pick this CD up today, you will listen to a record thatseems ambitous, out of place, triumphant, and lacking. The Eaglesmade a country-rock concept album explaining all those statements. The Eagles start with the tale of Doolin-Dalton, gunfighters in the old West. The trail unwinds through anxious young men to a man losing it, to a dying relationship, to a lonesome stargazer trying to find love, back to a gunfighter. The second side echoes the first although the lyrics reflect the loss the first side had brought on. It was a brilliant concept and it almost completely worked. The album lacks a complete vision of one person bringing all the ideas together. Frey and Henley worked completely together and stood each other up on some issues while in England, Roger Waters always got his way over the others in Pink Floyd. That is why Dark Side of The Moon is a masterpiece finished and Desperado is a masterpiece started."
4,Eagles concept album works a treat with me!!,"The follow up to their first album, was an unusual choice. The songs however are so good. Like all their albums, contains some less well know gems.I really loved "" Out of control"", ""Certain kind of fool"" "" Outlaw man "" and of course the classic "" Desperado""A good mix of tracks, nothing really bad, never skip anything when I play it.. always a good sign in an album.A must for Eagles fans.Worth a listen for country/ rock fans too."
1,Displeased with a few Chapters,Some of these chapters are out of date and not useful for the radiologist in general practice. I especially disprove of the Charboneau chapters. Rumack and Wilson are excellent!
5,GREAT SURPRISE!!,"We ordered 2 different sizes for a flower girl dress, and they were adorable! We were looking at a similar one for $144! Shipping was quick, we sent one back w/out any problem. VERY SATISIFIED and would highly recommend this dress for the quality and price!"
3,Beatifull but poor termination.,"The dress look beatifull, but the termination is very poor, the same day that my daughter use the dress the flower jus't fell down."
5,Love It,I absolutely love this show its FUNNY!!!! I cant wait for season three t.o come to amazon. Also get season two its great
5,WHere is my personal assistant?,"Heaven's lost property is the ultimate in cool. Brilliant in concept though the slap stick in the use of chibli anime a bit over done. However, the overall series makes it work and makes this a great show to watch."
5,Intense,I am a 45yr old advanced stepper (exercise 12hrs a week). I didn't have 1lb weights so I used 2.5lbs. Very intense. I recommend this workout for days when you want to combine cardio and strength.
2,Not worth your time,"The book spends more time on military politics than anything else. There was clearly not enough material here for a book to be written, so the author goes into great detail on mutiple views of the same story. It would have made a better magazine article than a book. The PJ's clearly do great things, but this book fails to tell their story."
1,"Interesting retelling of local ghost stories, BUT...","Devon, identified as the writer and narrator, is not very good at either. Her writing, which she apparently reads verbatim from the script, is stilted and full of grammatical errors. She inserts her own opinion as fact, repeatedly. Interesting if you familiar with Wisconsin, but nothing to write home about or to recommend. Some of the photography is beautiful. But the mish mash of the writing and narration turns it cheap and cheesy."
2,Great Judo Instructional DVD...If there is sound!,"I have purchased this DVD and found it 25% useful. Why 25%? Well the rest of the DVD seem to have no sound (i.e. both the replaced and original order). I have notified Black Belt as well as Amazon of this problem and hopefully they will address this issue ASAP as it is frustrating and disappointing to say the least. However, from what I have previewed so far (with sound) is quite good and very useful for the budding judoka. I am crossing my fingers to preview a working version of this DVD (2nd replacement) and provide some positive feedback.LovenAustralia"
3,Not up to snuff,"This video was created by Master Liang Shou Yu and Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming. Even though this dvd was published by YMAA I feel that it falls short of YMAA's standard of excellence. The main reason for this is that even though Dr. Yang is in the DVD the primary focus is Master Liang and his style of baguazhang. As with Master Liang's other videos I felt the demonstrations lacked any sort of power or intensity. I was also dissapointed by the lack of historical information that is usually present on Dr. Yang's DVDs. If you practice Master Liang's style of baguazhang this DVD may be of use to you; if not I would advise giving this one a miss."
4,Killing From Understanding Her...,"Do you understand why a woman killed the other woman??? It sounds crazy, but the first one fully understood the other one, and did it for her. It is not guilty!!!"
2,Self-conscious art & gloom,"This movie is about two women with adjoining apartments who are both obsessed with food - one is unable to eat while the other is driven to get her neighbor to enjoy her cooking. Their opposing personalities, lifestyles, and food obsessions are rooted in dark, disturbing histories that are graphically revealed through flashbacks. The story is told as a narrative: it begins slowly with an investigation by a police inspector into disappearance of one of the women. It picks up in the middle and is carried forward along with the investigation to a final, stunning conclusion.The imagery and characterizations are vivid although I found it too macabre for my taste. Also, the lower production quality was a little distracting, giving it a disjointed B-horror flick type feel. Although I didn't like the movie, others might enjoy and find fascinating the dark psychological elements and the shocking ending. It's definitely a movie that doesn't fade from one's memory."
5,Great Book!,I couldn't put this book down. It was a real page turner. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story with great characters.
4,"An easy to read story that has a little bit of humor, romance, and mystery","This book is Stephanie Bond at her best. It follows the lives of three sisters from the time they are pre-teens and witness a horrendous event until they are adults, estranged due to that event. It has something for everyone; humor, romance, and mystery with plot twists and turns that keep the reader engaged."
4,Enjoyable read,"A very enjoyable and surprising book with somewhat of an unexpected plot à la Agatha Christie. It definitely keeps the reader interested to the very end even after the murderer is identified. Very light, smooth flowing writing ideal for a ""just a good time reading"". Recommend it."
5,So many aspects to enjoy...,"I am difficult to please when it comes to romance/mystery stories, but this was excellent. #1, the main characters all get to express their viewpoint. #2, the romances are not predictable little formula stories and the sex scenes don't sound like they were written by a teenager. #3, the mystery is NEVER predictable, which is my favorite part. None of the characters are all good or all bad, and that is what keeps you glued to the story. I am now a devoted Stephanie Bond fan!"
4,kept me reading,i can read these women with some identification and much pleasure. they are human and funny. I enjoyed all of this book.
3,I Think I Love You,"This is an enjoyable mystery about a dysfunctional family with three grown up, but messed up daughters. It is basically a ""Chick Book"", but I did enjoy the story and it is fairly well written - a good Beach Read..."
5,Looks Great,"Not only is the quality better then I had with my old covers they look good too!Perfect fit for my 72 inch table. I did not tuck my chairs under. I have the ""Stackable Chair Covers"" for those....but it's so roomy that I could."
4,"As expected, high quality","Very highh quality....big enough for my table and 6 chairs. A bit awkward to put on and remove, but effecient and able to protect my set."
5,Quality,"I bought another cover prior to this one. It lasted in the Florida sun for less than three months. The Veranda cover is superior. The color is neutral, the fabric is quality and it is made extremely well. Happy shopper"
3,somewhat pleased,"it has those clip ties at the bottom but they aren't long enough to snap around the legs, and the other tie thing i cant get to tighten."
4,Wonderful Condition,The english book came to my house in excellent condition and was purchased at a discounted price!
4,"mmmmm.......great !!,but a little disappointed...","I loved the design and the look of the album itself, just by looking at it when I got it, I got all excited but....when I played it....I don't know, the lyrics are great but there are some songs that the music just dosn't go with the song. Some of the old ones I reather just hear them in the old beat up versions from years ago. I guess he just wanted to experiment with new things and everything he does is fine with me but if you buy this album thinking is going to be your typical Silvio's you are up for a surprise."
4,Nice Rhodes,"Though I am not real hip to the work of Steve Talaga, I enjoy it. Isn't that enough?I bought this disc on a whim, because I wanted to expand my collection of jazz albums with Rhodes piano on them.I didn't give it 5 stars because I wouldn't dare place it above Chick or Herbie, or any of those folks, but if you're into this kind of stuff it's worth checking out. There are some ambitious compositions on it."
1,Don't bother...,"But, if you can get over the writer's ego, condescension, racism, ego, morbid look at things, sarcasm, ego, ego, ego that is prevalent and predominant in this book, you'll love it!"
1,"Irritating, Racist, Filled with Bias, Ignorant & Uninformed","I think I made myself pretty clear with the title. But, if further explanation is necessary: Theroux is exactly what he claims to abhor about tourists & travelers. He's an egotistical, self-centered racist who has paddled aimlessly around the world in lieu of actually parenting the children he chose to have and be a husband to his original wife. The only reason I kept reading is bc I was traveling to many of the places about which he wrote. Additionally, I lived in HI and was interested in what he had to say about it. Ultimately I was embarrassed that I had to share Oahu with him. And if he mentioned one more time about his claim that scads of Japanese brides throwing themselves off hotel balconies...I mean really. If you're looking for a fact based book about Oceania, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a self-indulgent POS about a man's traveling mid-life crisis, you can have my copy. Thank God I only wasted a quarter on it."
4,Interesting,"This book is certainly interesting. While the author does his fair share of whining, as previous reviewers have mentioned, I think it is important to remember how he traveled. He chose to see the islands of the Pacific by kayak - certainly not an easy task, and probably a task which colored some of his views. Having said that, his descriptions of the islands I've been to were right on. I can't speak for all of them, of course, but I can say I did enjoy the book. I especially liked his account of his time in Tonga."
