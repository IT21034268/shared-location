3,"Powerful product, really difficult learning curve.","For the price, this is an excellent product. But it is so frickin' hard to understand.Pros:Easy to make simple inanimate landscapes.Cons:Animation tool almost incomprehensible (for me at least)Rendering takes forever. Rendering crashes.Lack of detail. It looks cartoonish."
4,Couldn't put it down.,"Every time I read a Kurt Vonnegut novel, I wonder why I havent read all of his works. This is a brilliant, hilarious novel rich with cynicism and irony. Vonnegut's dark humor is the kind that doesnt always make you laugh out loud, but cracks you up inside.. I finished the book in about 3 or 4 hours.."
3,Not my favorite Vonnegut book,"This was the third Vonnegut Book I read, and was definitly my least favorite. I found the story of Starbuck to be somewhat dull and dry at the beginning. While it became more interesting as the book progressed, I never really connected with the story. While it isn't a bad novel, it certainly is not Vonnegut's best. I certainly would suggest reading Cat's Cradle and Slaughter House 5 over this one."
4,"""Tatie Danielle"" directed by Etienne Chatilez and starring Tsilla Chelton and Isabelle Nanty","This is the character you NEVER want to have in your own family tree but we can all relate to certain aspects of her personality as she represents ALL that you detest. ""Sandrine"" is a perfect character to sort of ""tame"" the obnoxious ""Tatie Danielle"". Great fun but I always feel sorry for the little cocker spaniel!"
2,Not too happy...,"The delivery was estimated to arrive around January 17th. According to my ""Track Packages"" page, it SAID my purchase had arrived on January 15th, but in fact it did not arrive until February 8th or 9th...what was that all about???"
5,The Quiet Man,"I found the movie to be exactly what I remembered it to be. I thoroughly enjoyed re-visiting an old favorite and a true classic work. I found it extremely easy to find what I was searching for and then to order same. I had excellent follow up on the sale as I was told when it would ship, then when it did ship. It was received on time, in good condition, which thououghly pleased me."
5,John Wayne Lover.,I was familiar with the movie before I purchased it. I am very happy with the quality of the DVD.
3,Great Film - Sub-Par DVD Quality,"Shame on Republic Studios for producing a sub-par DVD transfer on such a wonderful classic. ""The Quiet Man"" deserved much better!If you already own the VHS copy don't waste your money on the DVD, unless you're interested in Leonard Maltins' ""Making of the Quiet Man"" featurette."
2,VERY POOR PICTURE QUALITY,"I rarely review my purchases but this one deserves a special warning. I know others have said it already, but the picture quality of this DVD is very disappointing, especially for a classic that deserves a full 5 stars. My parents have a VHS copy from 20 years ago that is much sharper than this. And to call it a ""Collector's Edition"" is just absurd. Great movie, but wait until it is re-released on Blu-Ray or re-released on DVD."
3,B & W,"I remember watching ""The Quiet Man"" as a kid on videotape. The colours were absolutely amazing. I was utterly disappointed with the quality of the DVD. Everyone look like bleeding oranges!!! I had no choice but to adjust my tv to black and white. Although the gray scale was pathetic, at least I was able to watch the movie without getting any eye strain."
2,Terrible Picture!...,"Great movie, lot's of extra's but an absolutely terrible picture. Hey Artisan...RESTORE THIS FILM!!!P.S. There is no widescreen version. In 1952 movies were still square."
3,"Great movie, mediocre DVD","This is one of my all-time favorite movies, so I was pleased when Artisan released this DVD -- I had the old version, which wouldn't play in our newer DVD player. I'm glad to have a working version, but overall I'm disappointed in this release. The color is punched up almost to the point of being artificial. We don't have a home theater sound system, so we can't tell the difference between the regular and ""enhanced"" audio. Worst of all, though: WHY ISN'T THIS LETTERBOXED?!! With the exception of Maureen O'Hara's commentary (very nice), the extras on this so-called Collector's Edition are no different than those on the previous release. I'll keep this DVD until someone comes out with an edition truly worthy of this wonderful movie."
3,This is such a sweet movie,It uses every Irish cliche...wonderfully. I can re-watch this over and over again. What a lovely movie.
2,TV Version of a Sweeping Comedy,"I cannot believe that they went to all the trouble to restore this classic and then chopped the sides off to make it fit a television screen. I am very disappointed. I checked and ""Staying Alive"", the John Travolta turkey of all time is available in Wide Screen! Why not The Quiet Man?"
4,Its slightly difficult to get the disk to read.,"The product is a direct copy of the VCR of this movie. Now because of this there are problems related to attempting to read it while on line. It constantly displaysan error of ""Disk not Found"". Once I did get it to work and read the disk correctly. Not sure why but it had something to do with a ""Blue Ray "" that was alreadybooted and running the movie related to that particular ""Blue ray"" disk. The final test was to see if I could read the ""Quiet Man"" from my off-line ""Blue Ray"" connected to my 50 inch screen. It booted quickly with no problems and I watched the movie. In short I have decided to keep "" Quiet Man"" as a backup to my original VCR of the ""Quiet Man"" They are of the same quality images. Simply a reproduction of the original.Forrest Martin(Not a purchase from Amazon)"
2,great movie terrible print.,"i am writing to confirm the views of other contributors that this is a very disappointing release.Its supposed to be a collectors edition ,but no true collector would want it,the movie has not been restored ,the colour is washed out,and the picture is fuzzy.one of the main attractions of this film is the beauty of its irish setting and of course miss ohara.However the quality is so bad you will be spending most of your time adjusting the picture.Such a shame and an insult to release a classic beautifully filmed movie in this condition."
2,Wonderful movie deserves a better fate,"A great cast and a wonderful setting -- Ireland -- make this one of my favorite movies of all-time. I watched my VHS copy so often I almost wore it out and I was happy to see it come out in DVD form -- until I watched it that is. For the most part the sound is crisp and clear, but the picture often looks as if it had been shot through a Kleenex tissue. The once magnificent colors are dull and the picture is snowy. Buy the VHS if you can still find it."
2,A taste of the blarney,"I owned but eventually gave away a DVD copy of this film because of its poor video quality. I wonder why Criterion hasn't jumped on this classic?Having said that, I wouldn't give this film a five star rating for either story line or acting -- it's more an Irish feel-good movie. But because of the strong Irish flavor of, I presume, a bygone era, it is enjoyable. I partcularly get a kick out of Barry Fitzgerald's criticism of John Wayne's self-styled introduction to Maureen O'Hara: ""Just who gave you permission to play patty cakes in the holy water?"" That slays me every time!I hope Criterion or someone will do right by this movie eventually and then I'll buy it again. The current quality level makes me wonder if the distributors think: Let them have chopped liver now and, when we eventually do it right, we'll sell it to them again. If that assumption is correct, it's time!"
3,How about a remaster in Widescreen?,"While watchable on NTSC, the presentation is pathetic on new HD monitors. It is time for this movie to be remastered from the original cine."
5,quality picture,"i just purchased this and i guess they must have heard your reiviews because the picture quality was great .just got back from ireland and i visted cong the town that they filmed the quite man in , great place to visitvisit early the quite man house closes around 4pm"
5,So glad this classic is in print finally.,"This classic is a St. Patrick's Day favorite. We misplaced are taped video a few years back and were disappointed that ""Quiet Man"" was not in DVD form. We are so pleased to have it has part of our film library again. John Wayne protrays another side of himself in this film. Very nice."
2,The Quiet Man,"Found the picture for the most part was dark making it hard torecognize the players at times, especially in low light times.Other than that the sound was great.Although it was not the best quality picture, I decided to keepthe movie anyway."
3,often boring but heinlein,i agree with the reviewers who say this is far from his best. most characters thin. i often have trouble seeing in my mind. practically unheard of for me and heinlein. still way better than most. though this is a slog for me as heinlein goes.
2,"good concept, executed poorly","This is the only Heinlen book ive read and it will likely be the last. The story starts out interesting enough - the human race travelling through space in a giant starship that they believe IS the whole universe. Through the course of events, the main character, Hugh, learns the real nature of the ship and futilly attempts to educate the population of his discoveries due to everyone else's religious beliefs about the ship - the universe as they know it. This is another interesting concept, however, the story is marred with dull characters and a weak ending. I would recommend this book for children in grade school, but not for anyone who is looking for ""serious"" science fiction."
4,learning heritage,"this is probably one of the best videos i've seen for teaching children chinese. it's clear, and easy to use--i never learned chinese when i was a kid, and this is helping teach my son what i never knew--we're learning a new language together!"
3,Mneh,"This was a quick book to read, but I really didn't enjoy it. It was about a boy who had some form of cancer. In order to get rid of the cancer, the doctor prescribed an experimental drug that they had never used on anyone before. It then caused Fred, the main character, to have superhero powers. To me this book shows, to young readers, that if you have cancer, you can have super hero powers and save the world. I know it is only a book and not all books are true, but this book made it seem like it was real life. Maybe to some, this book shows that if you think you can, you can. It could also show that even if you do have cancer, Chemo won't make you incapable of doing the things you like to do. That's why I will be putting this on my list."
4,Thelma & Louise,"Get your bowl of popcorn and enjoy the ""Evening of Video"" full of laughter with thelight hearted story of Thelma and Louise."
1,Seen it before,"Boring. Nothing revolutionary, and it probably only got the feminist vote because the ladies shot guns and drove off a cliff rather than submit to men. Fairly pathetic, as there is much better feminist fair out there."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A mediocre chicks-on-the-run film with inexplicably bizarre scenes (a passing biker blowing marijuana smoke into a car trunk which houses a captured cop?), Thelma and Louise may have an iconic last scene but it's not an interesting, enjoyable, or particularly-good film."
4,"Girl's night out, in a sense...","This film stars two wild and crazy gals who go on a breezy and uninhibited spree of revenge that ultimately ends in disaster, but getting there is what's entertaining about this movie. The film features several wild chase scenes, exploding tanker trucks, pantomimed oral sex, whole squads of police cruisers on the trail of the wayward women, a sympathetic cop who wants to save them, and a law enforcement establishment which has been embarrassed by being unable to stop their spree of violence and that wants them dead. Overall a pretty decent flick despite it's somewhat downer message and ending. But the action keeps the film moving along and Keitel, Davis, and Sarandon turn in fine performances, as usual."
3,A disappointing cold-war thriller from the Master,"""Topaz"" is a tired Cold War thriller from the Master.After the disaster of ""Torn Curtain"", Hitchcock had a go at making another ""Bond-like"" film but once again he missed the mark and never tried it again. If he had not made the brilliant ""Frenzy"" three years later one could easily have come to the conclusion that he was well past his best.One of the major problems with ""Topaz"" is that the actors are all second-rate - particulary Frederick Stafford in the lead role of a French intelligence agent.There are some interesting touches - for example the scene in the flower shop where we can't hear what the actors are saying - but this film smacks of a once-great director struggling to find his feet in the ""modern"" cinema.""Topaz"" should be seen once by all Hitchcock fans, but despite the advocacy of Leonard Maltin and other reviewers, Hitchcock's third-to-last film doesn't have much to recommend it."
2,One of Hitchcock's few mistakes,"If you have not seen this movie I highly suggest you either rent it or wait for it to be shown on AMC again. This is one of Hitchcock's worst movies. The character's and story are wooden and uninteresting. There is no signature Hitchcock humor and no exciting camera work. I am a huge Hitchcock fan and it is very hard for me to think of anything really positive about this film. It is simply not up to the Hitchcock standard. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because a bad Hitchcock movie is still better than most other films made around the same time.If you want to see some good Hitchcock movies that you may have missed, I highly recommend the Criterion Collection DVDs of The Lady Vanishes and The 39 Steps."
2,"once again the ""master of suspence"" is washed up in more cold war dlivel","hitchcock didn't learn from torn curtain and tried another cold war tale with even worse results. this mess starts with an american and french spys tring to trace leak of info to the russians. the real proplem here is we expect so suspence or thrills from hitchcock and none are delivered and the movie just goes on forever. still some may like and hitchcock fans may even love it, but not me the master has and would do better"
5,Can't Tell the Difference,"I've tried the Sony Car Cassette Adapter with music, audio books, and phone conversations on my iPhone and it works great. I can't hear any difference between a CD or playing something from my iPhone. The added benefit is that I can talk hands-free on my iPhone while I'm driving. It also works great with my MP3 player. The price is very reasonable compared to other brands and types of adapters. I highly recommend the Sony Car Cassette Adapter.Walkman Car Connecting Pack for MD Walkman and CD Walkman (Model# CPA-9C)"
2,The sound quality is not as good as expected.,"While using this connector to forge my iPod's stream to the car radio, I find it carries some distortion on the high freq, making some noise on the cassette player as well."
3,IPod/cassette adapter,"For the price, this is a good product. With the exception of an annoying clicking from the cassette it does the job well. For cars without MP3/IPod Jacks, I think this is a better alternative than the FM option with it's inherent interference"
1,No good with Ford F150 factory cassette player,I couldn't use this adapter in My F150. Very faint signal and too much noise. Absolutely worthless.
4,Good Cassette Adaptor,"I used to have a RCA Cassette Adaptor, used it with my Creative MUVO TX on my car. The RCA was very bad, lots of noise and the sound quality was aweful.Bought the Sony one 2 weeks back, noticed a great improvement. The bass and treble reproduction is amazing compared to the RCA. A little bit of noise is there at high volumes, but i hardly play music really loud.Very good buy !"
4,The Sony difference,The Sony Sony CPA-9C is a bit different than other simular Cassette Adapter's whereas it has small link of simulated audio tape within the tape path. I have a 2002 Tahoe with a CD/Tape unit. The tape device has an auto reverse transport. The Tahoe's auto reverse feature rendered other Cassette Adapter's (such as the Monster) unuseable as the Cassette Adapter would continually auto-eject. This little bit of simulated audio tape effectively fools the tape unit not to think that there is an error and eject the Cassette Adapter. There are other reasons that these adapters auto-eject (Google is your friend). But this Sony unit seemed to be the solution for me.
4,Good Deal,"I got this for my ipod after trying out a couple of FM transmitters. Its much cheaper and the sounds better. If you still have a tape player, this is one of the better options for taking your ipod on the road. Mine does make some mechanical noises but they are fairly quite and you can easily drown it out."
2,"It works, but with annoying click and low sound quality",I looked at the reviews and thought this one would be different than the other I previously had. The cassette adapter makes a continuous clicking noise and the sound quality is like a 5 out of 10. I recommend the FM tuner adapted for your audio needs. Peace
1,Sound quality is WEAK,"I was really excited to use this converter but ultimately am very disappointed in the sound quality. Perhaps it is my sound system (I have an 03 TDI Jetta with a Monsoon set up) and the fact that I am using it with an iPhone, but the volume is greatly diminished and the static/background noise is AWFUL. I definitely will be giving this item away for someone else to try or chucking it into my closet."
2,Frustrating Experience,"When it works, it's great. Problem is when it pops out of the cassette player at random times, causing me distraction from driving to pop it back in and jump back in the podcast to catch what I missed. Sometimes it runs for hours without a problem. Then it might pop out every 20 seconds for 5-10 times in a row. I had an Aiwa version for about 5-8 years that never did this in the same cassette player. I'm going to buy a replacement and wish I had sent this back for a refund."
4,Sony Cassette Adapter For MP3,"This product has worked out well for my use. The price was fair, and the product works just as well as any other fancy type of cassette adapter. I wish I had known more about how it can sound because I do sometimes hear static when playing music through this product. It's possible the static is my own car stereo system."
4,Music through car speakers from iPod,"The cassette adaptor is a simple and inexpensive way to play your iPod music through your car stereo. It works perfectly when the volume is loud, but when I play the volume softly in order to carry on a conversation, I hear clicking from the tape cassette - very annoying."
2,very disappointing,I got this adaptor so I could listen to recorded books from my iPod. The hissing it causes is loud and annoying. Makes the product essentially useless.
5,Sony CPA-9C is an excellent product for the price,Very satisfied with this product. For the money you can't go wrong!
3,"Very Good Sound, except....(now fixed).","This adaptor puts out clear sound with much more detail than another similar adaptor that I already owned. The only problem is that it frequently has a ticking noise that repeats every 2 seconds or so. To me it sounds like some kind of static discharge from the turning of the mechanism inside the adaptor. This ticking happens even if I unplug the audio souce from the adaptor. If I focus on the music, I can usually ignore it, but once it catches my attention, it sometimes makes me a little crazy. Aside from this annoying problem, it is a well constructed product with otherwise excellent sound.UPDATE: I sprayed some WD-40 in the adaptor and it cleared up the ticking noise. I still think it was a static discharge problem and now the added WD-40 keeps it from building up a charge. 5-stars rating now that the ticking is gone."
3,Its OK...not the best.,"I bought this to replace my broken Aiwa Cassette Adaptor; however, after using it for only a day I realized its not that good. The construction is not solid, the sound quality is good at best and the tape itself rattles quite a bit in the cassette deck.Although I have to say the cassette itself does output a ""higher"" volume, but by doing so it reduces the quality of the output (even after adjusting the volume on my iPod).Going to try the Panasonic Tape next."
3,Car Cassette adaptor for iPod shuffle,"The adaptor works well but the mechanism is noisy. On lower volume music you can hear the noise. But, I am glad to be able to play my iPod while I drive."
2,Warning! Worked Fine Until...,"I've had this cassette adaptor for approximately six months and it worked fine throughout the spring and summer months. I use it to play my iPod mini in my car. A couple days ago, all of a sudden, my car cassette deck (I have a 2001 Acura CL Type S with a Bose stereo system) started ejecting it for no reason. I tested a regular cassette in the deck to see whether my cassette deck had a problem (my warranty runs out in another 7000 miles so if THAT was the problem I'd get it fixed promptly!) and my regular cassette played with no problems. I checked the reviews on the Apple site and I saw that there are a number of people who have this problem but the adaptor would not work in their decks from the beginning. My adaptor did work for six months. I'm not sure why this is happening. The only thing that has changed is that it has recently gotten colder here over the last couple of days so temperature is probably a factor."
1,Broke after 4 months,"As others here have reported, it began making annoying loud clicking noises in my tape deck after just a 4 months of use.I normally love Sony products, but this one is badly designed."
1,Worthless,"I bought this to play my iPod in the car. At first, it worked fine, but after three days, the sound would only come out of the left speaker. After a week, it stopped working completely, and would only make clicking sounds when playing. I thought this would be better than purchasing a much more expensive FM transmitter for the iPod, but after this, I see the money would have been worth it."
1,Bad sounds,"I really dislike the quality of this product. It is really bad !!The sounds of the songs were awful, I have to buy the same product but different brand :(("
2,"2nd one, both broke soon","It was great when I first got it, but after a couple of months, it started ejecting itself constantly. So I bought a second one. After 5 weeks of use, the second one started popping out after a couple of minutes. The only thing that kept it in was reversing it then reversing again. But it still keeps popping out of the cassete player."
1,Worthless,Worthless. The tape deck clicks incesently and is extremely loud. I have tried other tapes and CD-Tape adapters and those are all quiet.
1,Poor Sound Quality,This cassette adapter makes a loud clicking sound and has very poor sound quality compared to 3 other cassette adapters that I have used in the past.
1,Worthless,"Using this with my ipod in my Volvo S60 it played only out of my right speakers, and with a lot of static. Also the volume was difficult to control."
4,Works very well,This works very well! I'm happy with the product-- for such a low price it allows me to listen to my Ipod in my car with a very nice sound quality. The only thing is that if you have a pretty bad tape deck it might not work too well. I tried it in another car that had a bad tape deck and it produced a lot of clicking and gapping in sound; but my tape deck is fine so it works perfectly there.
1,do not buy,This product does not work well at all. The sound quality is interupted by a constant static and the volume is constantly muted.
4,effective for the ipod,Essentially a speaker connection from your ipod to your car stereo. You can not beat the price for such an effective tool. Make sure you use the ipod to control the volume otherwise the sound quality will be effected.
5,Works GREAT!,Love this item! I use it to get my pc based gps audio through my car stereo! Works like a charm!
5,One of the Best that i have Used,"Well, I have used 3-4 cassette adapters, till i heard this one, only words that i can say is you have to hear it to identify the difference.i have been using it with my cd player and also with IPOD, with others i had to make sure that the volume on ipod was 100% but with this one hey 85% is too much.Well i showed it to 1 of my friend and he also loved it, and took mine and told me to get another.Don't hesitate to buy this one."
5,Best So Far,"I finally bought this Sony Adaptor after having tried several others and a Belkin FM transmitter. No conparison. This is really the only reasonable option I have for my car (Jaguar) since a system upgrade for my IPOD is way too expense. So for 20 bucks, I get shockingly clear abd full sound from this adpter. It fits perfectly and I have no hiss or clunking sounds I've seen reported. BTW, the FM broadcaster was so bad it sounded like my speakers were blown even when I had no interference from other stations; that thing cost over 50 bucks. For the money, you should definatly give this a shot if you have a cassette slot in your car. I have a direct connection for the stereo in my truck and honestly my ear cannot tell the difference."
1,Does not work,"Constant loud clicking noise when the tape deck runs over the tape. Disappointing buy, thought it would work great with my smart phone but the clicking noise is obnoxious."
4,decent purchase,i needed an adaptor for my car to plug my zune in since it only has a tape deck. this works great and so far i havent had any trouble with it...
1,Terrible and completely unnecessary,"I cannot believe that anyone at Universal saw this screenplay and felt it worthy. This movie does nothing but detract from the original masterpiece. The characters and flat and uninteresting, the deaths are quick and unsuspenseful, leaving most of the movie to support itself on its boring story and poor dialogue, and the ending is terrible!I'm not saying that a sequel to ""Psycho"" shouldn't have been made. However, if a sequel were to be made, this obviously wasn't it. There's nothing remotely decent about this sequel other than Anthony Perkins. Made only to cash in on one of the most popular films of all time, ""Psycho II"" is a terrible slasher that has contributed to the bad reputation the genre has gotten. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
4,loving sex-ultimate sexual massage,"Just as the title says, 'loving sex & without question, the ultimate sexual massage,' thinking of which, I could sure use one right now!"
2,"Little, cute and silent","Same problem as another reviewer: the attractive tea pot whistled for a few days and stopped. If there was a mechanism for it, it's gone. Perhaps I poured it into my tea and drank it.Additional comment: After a while the teapot began to whistle at the boil. It's not particularly loud, but if I'm in the kitchen it's enough. So it's still little and cute, with a demure whistle. Give it two more stars."
1,Poor effort; would not recommend,"Mediocre presentation; little organization to the material; author on an ego trip to sell his ""espionage"" services to companies. Would not recommend."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I've bought many edging tools over the years and NONE do a good job, including this one. This does NOT edge up against the trim work, it leaves a small line and therefore I had to still trim it by hand with a brush. The BIGGEST waste of $15. If I had red reviews before hand, I wouldn't have bought it!"
2,why bother,"In the time it took to figure out how this thing worked I could paint the trim free hand. Messy, complicated, frustrating. the paint tray is hard to hold too. I used the Handy paint Can and a brush and was done in no time. Don't bother with this thing"
5,by far the best dracula,It is no wonder why they used the same actor to portray dracula in the buffy series. this film is by far the best dracula film out there. IT only leaves you wishing there was more vampire myth at the end.
4,"Nice overview for beginners, but...missing a few things","While it's always nice to have all of Mica's stunning singles all in one place, it would have been more valuable for true fans of Micar Paris and completists like me to have sought-after tracks, like her many rare, long deleted B-sides and non-LP tracks, PLUS where is the amazing club/house remix of MY ONE TEMPTATION remixed by Bruce Forrest in 1989 and only appearing on the original U.S. 12""? I have it on vinyl, but would have been nice to have on CD for clarity and posterity - but still, if you're coming to Mica new, this is a good value for the $$$."
5,one of my fav. albums of all time i would say,as first i didnt get songs such as bugs/ foxy mop/ etc.. but you have to listen to this album as a whole/ then it makes perfect sense/ vitalogy is awesome/ eddie vedder wrote some of the best lyrics of his career and truly moved me to tears many times when i finally gave this cd the proper chance/ bravo pearl jam/ brilliance
1,crap,"I am convinced that Amazon writes their own favorable reviews to sell albums. This is the only way that this pathetic, throw-away of an album could possibly get more than 1 star. This album lacks melody, structure, feeling, mood and originality. This album was clearly released to satisfy label requirements -Pearl Jam put no effort into this release. The reason that I am reviewing this album 6 years after its release is that I've noticed that there are very few negative reviews posted on this site. This led me to believe that Amazon either only posts favorable reviews or writes their own. So, in order to test this, I picked one of the worst albums I have ever heard and checked the reviews. Guess what? Every review claims this album to be a ""masterpiece"" and ""best ever"". Come on. Can anyone really find this album listenable?"
2,the same sentiment as my review for YIELD,"If you read my review of YIELD, it will apply to this album just as well - it's boring, bland and uninteresting.If I might add, I had a great time listening to the garage band THE DETROIT COBRAS - their musical sense of ROCK N ROLL is right on par with spirit, sound production and the way RNR should be played. PJ should take some lessons from them."
3,"There's some cool songs on Vitalogy ,but...","The opening few tracks rock, seriously; Spin the black circle is frenetic, and Not for you rages. Betterman, Immortality and Nothingman are really beautiful pieces of songwriting. What really irks you as you listen to this cd are the non-song tracks: Bugs, Pry to and Stupid Mop - they are just plain irritating and not in the least bit interesting after you've heard them once. I seriously pity anyone who buys this on tape because they won't be able tojust skip these tracks like you can on cd."
5,The third classic album in a row by Pearl Jam,"Want singles and hits? You've got em.Rockers: ""Last Exit"", ""Spin the Black Circle"", ""Not For You"", ""Corduroy"", and ""Immortality""Mid-tempo hits: ""Nothingman"" and ""Better Man"".And even: ""Tremor Christ""This is an excellent album with everything you have come to expect from Pearl Jam. Really, their first three albums were a dynamic trilogy that will always be their best work. They have continued to make strong music, but have released more experimental stuff in recent years, and have sort of become the new Grateful Dead, in a way.This is a must-own album for any fans of rock music, hard rock, and the Seattle sound of the 90s."
4,MORE GREAT MUSIC!!!!,"PEARL JAM is a great heavy rock punk band with some acoustic ballads...i really love TEN and VS, and enjoy most everything they did after...VITALOGy is a little different from the thunderous guitar attack of TEN and VS...they turn the sound to a more punk sound and the ballads become WAY more present...this is a very good album, with great songs like LAST EXIT, NOT FOR YOU, CORDUROY and BETTER MAN...VERY GOOD!!!"
3,Do I need to give this album a second chance?,"Everyone seems to love this album, many going so far as to praise it as Pearl Jam's best. I guess I just don't get it. Betterman and Immortality are great songs, and Not for You is certainly bearable... but lets face it, this is an album with a track entitled ""Stupid Mop."" The rockers on here are too repetetive, too boring, and smell too much of mindless punk rock too possibly compare with rocking-yet-insightful tracks on earlier Pearl Jam albums such as Once, Glorified G, Leash, Even Flow, etc. Oh, and Corduroy is a GREAT song live, but on the album it just somehow doesn't sound as good."
4,Fine Album,"I've not very much to add to the other reviews but one thing: The dramatically underrated song ""Aye Davanita"" is to me the highlight of the CD. It is not ""easy"" to listen, and it seems to be nothing more than some boring loops with no melody at first hearing. But close your eyes, and listen to all the details and superb guitar details, and you will hear the quality of this song."
5,"Dakr and Brooding, and I Love It","This album is very DENSE, in that one can hear the innermost thougths of pearl jam as they play through the 14 songs. There are a couple of tracks that are pointless (Pry, To, Stupid Mop, Aye Davanita), which serve as little more than background noise. But the others are sheer brilliance; right from the buoyant up-tempo of Last Exit through the terrifyingly emotional Immortality. Powerful and moving, Vitalogy pulls you in and exposes you to just how deep Eddie Vedder and PJ can be."
5,Actually I give it 4.75 stars,"This is Pearl Jam's 3rd cd. It didn't captivate me as much as Ten did, but still marvelous in its own right.My favorite PJ song of all is on this cd, Immortality. And I know my PJ. I have about 15 PJ cd's.The only disappointing thing about this cd is the last song, heyfoxymophandlemommathatsme.Get it anyway."
5,A little gem of a western,"One of Lancaster's best movies in my estimation. Also, I hike that country and you get a real feel for what it must have been like to have lived in that area one hundred plus years ago. Unlike some others, I thought the translation to DVD was pretty well done. The sound is especially good on my system."
4,let's reconsider,"I read through the other reviews and I understand where they're coming from. Yes, the book is written like an alcoholic's 12 step program BUT Harris is kind of right. At first, I was almost confused as to whether it was a joke or not, but as I read further, I realized that the bad habits that writers have are actually base upon insecurities. Harris tells the reader to suck it up - quit caring so much about what other people might think of your writing - and write good srong sentences. Once you actually get to the 12 steps, I think there is some really useful information in there. I was not overpowered by techinical issues. Harris clearly and simply states what to look out for in your own writing. He actually lists them - which makes this a good reference manual to put on my desk. So the book is based on a joke (if that's what you want to call it). I found it funny. Even funnier, I saw myself in what he was saying."
2,I got this for Christmas,"I need a diet scale and had been using a postal scale. I like how I can put my bowl on the scale and get a tare weight, measure in grams or oz. The glass surface popped off of its base and I am gluing it back on. Meanwhile I'm wondering about all the food values it has stored that I have no use for. Who would weigh a beer? but I can't get a value of my low carb cereal and store it in it's memory. I wish I could program it with my own values using the USDA food date base- It is a free 5 star download for dieters. I find the scale data base useless"
4,DigiWeight,"I was very impressed with the ability of this scale to weigh various food items; however, some of the food items that I eat are not listed in the book and therefore I cannot enter the proper ""food code"" to get the nutritional readings that are available with other foods on the list. Other that that, this is an excellent kitchen item and I am very, very pleased with it."
3,billy the kid,"this one is designed to fuel a billy the kid lives style story.it wont hurt the kids i dont think.lou diamond phillips,keefer sutherland and emilio estevez arein it.the first one was better.besides the first one,this is one of the best western flicks ever.a red head whore goes topless for a few.that part was the best.each of the actors did thier best in this and the first young guns."
1,Another Dr Oz suggested supplement??,"I am so done buying supplements suggested on Dr. Oz. I have yet to try one that actually does as he suggests. I'm sticking with my one and only tried and true multivitamin, my zinc pill, and a selenium pill a day."
4,Almost Perfect,"I purchased this vacuum for a couple of reasons. First of all, the power boost and hush modes are very helpful. With the power boost, it gives you a little extra kick for either a few seconds, or lock it into place to clean a whole area with it. The hush mode feature really does make the vacuum quieter. I saw a reviewer said this didn't work. If you read Hoover's website, this is a FAQ. You need to remember to take the vacuum out of power boost. Secondly, It has a HEPA filter in the dustbin as well as a second final filter for air coming out. Lastly, aside from your standard attachments, it has a ""power brush."" It's a handle with a mini agitator that you can use to easily clean stairs and upholstery with.My only gripe is that there is no onboard storage for the power brush. I think it was a last minute addition because their are two sets of directions, a big packet which makes no mention of the brush, and a 2 page insert specifically for the brush.Overall, a good buy for the price."
1,Horrible Product... Please don't purchase!,"Filter has to be seriously cleaned after EACH use.Dust canister stays dusty after use of product and overall looks very sloppy.Dust canister dropped out of my hand at a height of 1 foot and split 6 inches the 1st day - very low quality product.Packaging of product had been extremely abused upon delivery from original source - horrible delivery of product.Quiet mode isn't quiet - waste of product design.Would NEVER recommend this product! Please don't purchase, waste of money!"
1,piece of junk,"Awkward to use, unclear instructions (poorly translated from Chinese, which probably doesn't help), and didn't light up very brightly even after I figured out how to make it work. On the other hand, it was cheap."
1,make ahead entertaining...great idea,"Mabel Hoffman is one of my favorite cookbook authors and I have others of her books which I use a lot. I found the recipes in this book fairly good, but the make ahead procedures were just common sense, not truly ""make ahead"". They were just things you could do ahead of time (but I can figure that out myself). I did think that the recipes were different, interesting and good for new twists on old concepts. The recipes, as usual with Mabel, were reliable and instructions are clear. Pictures are good. Its good to have on the shelf."
2,Disturbing for young children & adults,"My 4 year old daughter borrowed this book from her pre-school class & brought it home. I saw the cover & thought the little boy & his dad were flying somewhere. No, they are homeless, living in an airport, disguising themselves so they don't get caught by security, bathing in airport sinks, dad is leaving for work on the bus & leaving his kid at the airport with other homeless people, etc... need I say more? I was reading this to my 2 & 4 year olds & after just the first page, I was thinking ""WTF???"" to myself. I made sure to put the book out of sight after that so they wouldn't ask me to read it again. I wouldn't say it's a book for kids & it will obviously lead to so many questions & I don't feel like my children would understand my answers. I think I was just shocked because this book was so different than any of the others that they bring home from school. Reality that kids that young don't need thrown in their faces."
4,Fly Away Home,"Fly Away Home really shows the difficulties of being homeless, from a little boy's point of view. This story is placed in a airport, where the boy (along with his father) plays the game of not getting noticed and not getting caught. You really feel bad for them, and the harsh truth is that there are people like this. But the boy still has hope that they won't be homeless and will have a better life. This really makes you think of how lucky we truely are. I give this book 4 stars out of 5"
3,"half of the book superb,half of it not fulfil","this book is talking about natural health, and it shows the diseases of many kinds in a very simple and short explanation, and short strategy that take place on a 1-2 pages. in the case of food healing secretes it is o.k. but when we discus diseases and strategy we should try to be more informative even though we need to be practical rather then just explainable.that is the reason why i said that it is more fulfiling in one part of it comparing to the otherone. in short it is a good book, and i do recommand it with 3 stars."
2,FORGET THE MOVIE-- READ THE BOOK,"After seeing this movie, I made a voew never to sell the movie rights to any novel I may write. This was clearly a Hollywodization of a wonderful and complicated story. There was too much going on in this plot for it to have ""and they lived happily ever after"" as its implied theme. END"
3,No award winning performances but worth watching.,"Not a bad movie but extremely watchable.Julia does a good turn as a surrogate nurse to a wealthy leukemia sufferer. The one snag is the title,which probably put people of.It did me anyway until I caught it by accident. Alternate title could be ""I want to live"". Yeah I know,the Susan Hayward flick. Pity miss Roberts didnt go on to better things."
4,Good movie,"I thought the critics' reviews of this movie were very unfair. Granted, it may not be the greatest movie ever made, but it's still a good one. Julia Roberts and Campbell Scott make a great on-screen couple, the story is intriguing, and it will definitely make you appreciate your own health and might even make you realize things you take for granted."
3,One of Julia's better films,"Before she became a star Julia Roberts did small films such as this one. Although she doesn't have great range, she does a good job and is believable as a woman who gets drawn in emotionally to a dying man. The leads are very good, but sometimes the movie relies on cliches. She's from the other side of the tracks, goes clubbing and is uneducated. He's working on his phd, is cultured, and hasn't been able to experience a full life due to his illness. This part could have been done better. Still it is a welcome relief to the pat dramas Hollywood is turning out now."
2,Love it only if you're obsessed with Bionicles,"My son loves this game, because he loves Bionicles. He likes having the characters, and he likes being able to fling the ball.The board game itself is almost entirely luck, no skill. The flinging takes a tiny amount of skill -- I never missed.The instructions are inadequate. They leave out obvious things like what to do when two players land on the same space. More importantly, the instructions on the cards sometimes conflict with the game instructions (e.g. rules say to roll die or take a card. The card that says to use it when you land on a specific type of space. Does that mean you can use the card on a turn where you have already rolled the die? no way to know).My son played the game for a couple of weeks and then forgot about it.So, buy this game only if your child is obsessed with Bionicles. For the non-obsessed, this game has little to offer."
3,"Excellent Performance, Poor Durability","Just 2 weeks ago, I purchased the PEG-S320. Although extremely fast with features such as 8mb and Palm OS v.4.0, I was very disappointed when, after only 2 weeks, the paint on the ultra- slick module began to chip. To further my dismay, I soon noticed the beam feature would not function. Overall, this product is packed with many appealing amenities, although the beam defect and the paint chips detract from my opinion of the PDA."
2,"Very poor visibility, and bad stylus response","This is the only Sony handheld (at present- 01/02) that can connect to a cellular modem and it's a shame. The screen is horrible. The color ones, such as the Clie 760 are great but there's no wireless modems to go with them."
3,An okay read.,"The Black Lizard Anthology of Crime Fiction contains 20 short stories by 20 different authors, including one by editor Edward Gorman. A number of the stories are copyright 1987, contemporaneous to the release of this anthology. Others had seen publication in earlier years, with the earliest dating back to 1957.Iconic pulp fiction writers, Harry Whittington and Jim Thompson both have stories in this collection. Though most of the authors are latter day types. Among the better stories is ""Scrap"" by Max Allan Collins a Chicago based tale featuring fictional PI Nathan Heller.All in all, The Black Lizard Anthology of Crime Fiction is a fairly average collection. Many of the stories are well written though, as is the case with all such anthologies, some are better than others. An okay read for those partial to short stories about the darker side of life."
4,Good service,"The quality of the product was great, and the speed with which it was deliveried was exceptional."
5,Pleased,"I was very pleased with my order from Amazon. It was in excellant condition, and I will use Amazon again when I am looking for Books, ect. Thank you for your inquiry,it means you care about your customers. T Y Donald Rankin"
2,A Shallow and Silly Book,"This is a silly book. The magical realism that is the hallmark of Alice Hoffman'sstyle is apparent, but none of the attributes of her writing are evident in thisbook. The premise of the book is ignorant, bordering on repellant.A young welder causes an explosion at a power plant and seeks therapy. Thetherapist falls in love with him and initiates an affair. No boundaries exist. Asif the affair wasn't enough, the therapist also breaches confidentiality. Hoffmantreats this all as okay.The relationships are shallow and the dialogue simplistic. I expect much betterfrom a writer of Alice Hoffman's caliber. I recommend skipping this book andreading one of her better ones such as 'Illumination Night' or 'Second Nature'."
2,Typos Galore!,"Is there a software program that scans handwriting and transcribes the text to arial font? That's the only explanation for the many, many typos in this book that are far too odd to have been made by even the most illiterate human; hum instead of him, |)lease instead of please, 1 instead of I, and periods instead of commas. I'm not even halfway through the book and I'm fed up with these ridiculous errors. Maybe it's only the Kindle version and maybe Amazon could run spellcheck on books before releasing them."
1,You get what you pay for,I just threw this radio in the garbage after about 2 months use....not even worth the money to ship back. It just stopped working.
2,Quality control issues at factory,"This is the 2nd time I've purchased this Coby CX39 radio. The first time, it performed well and I gave it to my roommate as a parting gift because he enjoyed listening country music radio stations out of it. The 2nd radio I purchased, I thought the quality was due to high voltage powerlines nearby that was causing poor reception. But I have a boombox stereo playing in another room. I moved that boombox to the kitchen and realized I can receive more radio stations on it that I could on this Coby CX39 :-{ Besides poor reception, the digital readout display is out of calibration. When the radio DJ would pause for station identification, they'd announce (for example) ""...news 980.."" (AM dial), yet the digital readout shows ""990."" I turn the dial to 980 and I loose reception on the radio station. I've posted this Coby CX39 on Craigslist and had sold it for $5 to some Hispanic guy (illegal alien) who spoke limited English. Thus, I was able to recover some of my $$."
1,hate it,This item is terrible. It has NEVER worked...and is not worth sending back. It would cost more to send it back than it cost to buy. I was surprised to find you selling it since you usually have quality merchandise.
4,This is great!,"So it's a little weird wearing a fanny pack...but the Case Logic CD Sports Beltdeluxe isn't too bulky. You can't compare it to strapping a mini ipod on your arm or anything, but for carrying your CD walkman...the stretchy material fit so smoothly and snugly that even after jogging for 30 minutes, I forgot it was there! The extra pockets are helpful, too. I like to keep a tube of chapstick and my car keys in them but you can put loose change or your ear buds in it, too. Oh yeah, there are three slots for extra CDs."
1,A Big Exam Cram Series Fan Pans This One,"If you check my reviews of other Exam Cram titles, you will find them near gushing and all 10's or 9's. This puppy, however, is a disaster. This book wanders aimlessly. It does little to teach coding techniques or exam topics, in fact, many of the examples are absurd and wrong. The end of chapter questions are an exploration of the depths of triva and irrelevance. How did such a book ever happen? You will be far better served in this one instance by spending the extra money for either the New Riders or Que titles. Let's hope this is the first and last time I have to write a review like this about an otherwise phenominal series of books."
3,"Good exam coverage, but too many typos","I found this book to be a useful study guide for the exam (passed on first try), though not really a substitute for general VB experience. The book covered the VB 5 exam topics thoroughly, and several of the book's examples appeared verbatim on my exam. I was disappointed, however, in the number of errors and typos appearing in the book, as well as the ""exam is going to trick you"" tone of the book's sample test questions - my actual exam was much more straightforward..."
2,Would have been nice if it actually worked,Got the generator in and it worked once. After that the motor would run but would not generate any AC or DC power. Customer servcie was unable to locate a service center that would work on the unit. They authorized a refund within just a few days.
1,Did not Start out of box. Opps my fault,Bought generator in Feb .Opened it when lost power. The generator would not start. Called customer service which required that you leave a message. Never got back to me. Finally got thru and now have to fax copy of my order before they will tell me where I can go to have it fixed. A bad company When I needed generator in an emergency ( out of power for 9 days) it was a bust. After repair found out I did not put in enough oil and when the repair man put in correct amount of oil started right up and runs fine. It's not operating was my fault. Will stay with customer service problems. Was repaired by Sears which was very accomidating
4,A great catchy album with only some minor flaws,"Imagine what it would sound like if you crossed Weezer and Green Day light. You'd get this collection of songs. This lbum has catchy songs like ""Happiness is all the Rage"" and ""The Deep South"". There's two mellower songs ""Things Just Getting Good"" and ""All of My Everythings"". I have several of their albums and musically this one is their best. Lyrically, however, a few of the songs fall a bit flat. The songs still rock but it feels like their creativity ebbs in songs like ""Skips a Beat (Over You)"". It repeats the same bouncy trite verse and refrain. Still songs like ""Emergency! Emergency!"", ""Living Around"", and ""Jersey Shore"" make up for that song. The only other song that's a bit on the weak side is ""Arms & Danger"". Other than that, it's a great album."
4,This is a fun pop-record.,"Much-improved vocals. I could've stood a little more variety on the guitar work though. Catchy stuff to sing along to. Jenny from Tsunami sings back-ups on some tracks, which was an added bonus. Worth checking out."
1,What Happened?,"This album was simply a dissapointment. the music seems like uninspired structured drivel, such a change from the complexity of 30 degrees. this is not what i think of when i hear the promise ring....."
2,LOL,"LOL, you have the group confused with someone else. ABC was never a boy band, silly. The music on this CD is their greatest hits compilation and it is very much a reflection of what they did while they were together. The guy on the cover is the singer and no one tried to pull anything on you, you simply ordered a CD by the wrong band. LOL"
3,Schizophrenic?,"ABC has never been the same since the smashing debut Look Of Love. There are one or two gems post, for example Ocean Blue - an absolutely brilliant song, perhaps their best. Putting the entire lot into one album is kind of a schizophrenic experience. The How To Be A Millionaire phase was just boring.And according to the reviews this collection contains Man Trap, the smoky remix of Look Of Love, but I don't see it anyway. Man Trap is a rare gem indeed - literally. It may have served this compilation to have the B Side of Ocean Blue - The Atlantic Mix is even better than the original version."
2,the look of flub...,"Where-are-they-now contenders and theatrical `80s video new wavers, ABC bandleader Martin Fry keyed off the synthesized R&B pop of bigger names like David Bowie and Roxy Music, and with a knack for glittery overblown melodics, thumped out a string of rather memorable dance hits -Poison Arrow, The Look of Love, Be Near Me, When Smokey Sings -all of them included here. The rest of it is a take-it-or-leave guide to the band's declining fortunes, wherein having milked every possible angle out of their glossy camp schtick, they tried their hand at writing serious music with predictably disastrous results."
3,OK...BUT MISTREATED,"... This is s film that is worth a watch. No one will ever rank it with The Searchers... but it has its own charms. To those who slam the film for the alleged anachronism... the use of the word ""punk..."" I suggest that they look up the origin of the word. It is not modern... Shakespeare used it four times and by 1858 in the United States was used not only as rotten wood used for starting a fire... but as term for worthless young man. Sorry... it is *not* '70s slang... You need to find another club with which to beat the film.... Peck took a lot of heat for the mustache that he had in The Gunfighter... critics griped about it at the time (though absolutely correct for the period...) Today the film is viewed as a classic... Anachronisms? Try 1890s Winchesters in westerns set in the 1860s and 70s... and most notoriously in The Comancheros, set in the 1840s... This film deserves to be viewed on its merits."
2,Same Old Hathaway Recipe,"Henry Hathaway found a recipe for making western movies and did not alter one lousy bit. True Grit, Five Card Stud, Shootout - the bad guys from each film in order - Dennis Hopper, Roddy McDowall, and Robert Lyons - they all wear the same outfit.What did they do - pass them down from one film to the other? Also, it appears that True Grit and Shootout have some of the same location scenes shot from the same angle. One more thing - take a close look at the scene at the train depot and see if you cannot find a jet stream. I recommend Gregory Peck's, The Stalking Moon, over Shootout. Stalking Moon has a little more bite and grit and makes no reference to ""punks""."
4,Shoot Out (1971),This movie Shoot Out (1971) is a good ol' western flick that brings back lots of memories from the days that I had my trusty 'Fanner Fifty' side arm. I recommend it to any wester lover.
5,Pleasurable mental stimulation,"There are two types of puzzles in this book. On each page there is a close up photo of a common object with a short textual clue underneath. For example, on page 37 there is a photo of two batteries and the caption is ""Cell mates."" Most of the time these puzzles are easy to solve, but there were some that I just could not get. One in particular was a paper towel with the caption, ""Dam the flow.""The other puzzles are textual and some are tricky, but easy to solve if you are careful. For example, there is the question regarding what historical event occurred on November 31, 1793. Of course, with 30 days in November, there was no such day. My favorites were the garbled nursery rhymes. I found them easy to decipher, but I admired the cleverness that went into creating them.This is an enjoyable collection of puzzles, they provided me with a great deal of relaxing mental stimulation, which is always a pleasure."
3,Good price but didn't last,"I invested in this product a few months ago and suddenly it quit working. The reason I invested in this cord was the same issues I was experiencing now. The cord was no longer charging my battery for my laptop. However, I found that this cord has become useful in powering my Canon MP series printer. So it wasn't a total waste!"
3,"Item as described, shipping a little slow.","I was pleased with item, seems to work well as described, however, shipping could have been quicker. My adapter was on it's last leg when it finally arrived, about 4 days after expected.Otherwise, a good purchase."
1,This video teaches you nothing!!!,"I mbought this tape b/c I was taking a fun funk aerobics class at my gym and was SO DISAPPOINTED!!! This video is hard to follow, goes too quicky and actually offers maybe 15 minutes of instruction....The biggest waste is a 15 segment which tells you to freestyle and jam to the DJ's music. While the music is fun and the people are really beautiful -- it is more like tuning into MTV's Spring Break than working out. Save your cash...."
3,Decent,Not bad at all for the price. But almost useless for recording music without the addition of other equipment.
5,A fun movie to see! Especially Andie.,"I loved this movie! It's a lot of fun to watch and very entertaining. The plot was a little confusing but i'm a huge Andie MacDowell fan, so i was occupied by her charm in this movie. It has a lot of cute jokes and even non jokes were still funny by the expressions on the actors faces. It was a very cute movie to watch. For all Andie fans, this is a great on to see. She's stunning in it. So i highly recommend it, just for the joy of Andie and a cute fun movie to watch!"
2,Make no mistake - these 2 stars belong to Andie only,"When I read the short summary of the story, I was anxious to see this movie. It evoked reminiscences of the exciting, urbane and witty thief-stories of the fifties and sixties. Instead, I saw 100 minutes where practically nothing is happening. The question arises: ""Where has the director been?"". Some films may have turned out the way they were expected to, flattening the tension curve to yawning dimensions. But this product hasn't even the slightest bud of excitement, veni vidi - that's all. You fans of Andie MacDowell - she's ""Too marvellous for words"". Rarely did she look better and her acting is charming as ever. That's the only recommendation I can give - but it would be enough reason to watch a bore like this film."
5,A good book for disillusioned liberals,"Thirty years ago I would have identified myself as ""A"" liberal. Now I say I am liberal, but I can't identify with modern-day liberalism. Sometimes I say that I am a 19th century liberal. Until I read this book, I found this confusing.The author shows that liberalism has been co-opted by collectivists (socialists) who have perverted the original liberal ideal.Skidelsy's analysis of historians, philosopers, sociologists, and priests is exquisite (p. 163), and his conclusion about the difference between capitalist democracies and communist countries is profound (p. 196).Liberalism was originally an ideal that promised to liberate people from supersition, servitude, and ignorance. It has turned into a system that is having the opposite affect.I infer from this reading that there is a natural tension between the halves and the half nots. However, economists and social planners are just a bunch of thirds.This a book well worth reading."
2,A psycological mishap,"Though this novel is supposed as a psycological materpiece I have found it to be sordid and incongruent. Stendhal should have spent less time on his discriptions of Julien Sorel's superficial love endeavors and ""rendez-vous"" and more time on his character's true personality. After reading 508 pages I found the main character to be a complete stranger. All that was revealed about Julien was that he stuck to his morals all the way to the end. Stendhal should have learned from his creation's ideals and stuck to the basics."
4,"Be Open, But Think For Yourself","Beginning of the End is a fascinating look at where the world is heading in relationship to the fulfillment of Biblical prophecy. A vague sort of marker on the timeline of earth's predetermined destiny. He does a fairly decent job of using previously fulfilled prophecies to prove the veracity of the Bible, and then goes on to give his educated opinion of how the end times might play out. While Hagee offers much to learn and ponder, no self-respecting person, especially a Christian, should take his word to be infallible. Read the book, do your own study and research, and come to your own conclusions. As Hagee himself states in the book, most of it doesn't really even matter for Christians because we won't be here when it happens anyway."
3,below Shirow's level,"Don't expect this to be Ghost in the Shell. It really isn't. Its more of a Bubblegum Crisis knock off. Five hot chicks, who work for another hot chick, pilot a squad of very kewl looking 'Land Mates', or power armours, and fight crime. I like the robot designs.If you want to watch hot anime girls doing action watch these: (Gunslinger Girl, Noir, Iria, Burst Angel, Original Dirty Pair, Mezzo, Najica Blitz, Slayers, Shadow Skill, You're Under Arrest, and more)."
4,a good place to start learing mental math,"This book does not give a system of how to use the the various short cuts.It does not say when and where each short cut is most useful.Thereby,trying to remember all or any of them leads to confusion.However,i found the chapters on ""using zeroes to hold places"", addition,subtraction,and ""cross multiplication"" to be superb!If you are a concerned parent,student ,or adult ; i recommend SPEED MATHEMATICS SIMPLIFIED by edward stoddard as the most comprehensive manual of shortcut math available anywhere! Learn the simple truths about the japanese and german approach to basic arithmetic . Then on the opposite side of the coin(READING) i recommend :HOW TO READ A BOOK ,by mortimer adler /charles van doren."
3,Dissapointed,"I was really looking forward to reading this book.I thought it was just ok, but the author repeats herself so much and you get the feeling that she feels sorry for this man. Hs should be executed I can not imagine anyone who thinks he should ever be free again! Insane or not he needs to be locked away forever!!"
4,yummie,loved the 1972 original and who doesn't like dessert? Lucky for me my wife received this and has made many cheesecakes and other yummy stuff.
1,B-O-R-I-N-G!,"This book is excellent as an insomnia remedy, but that's about it. Unless you cannot sleep at night and want something so dull that it will make your eyelids droop after thirty seconds, do not bother buying this book."
2,So little for so much,"Bit of a waste of DVD space. Interesting concept, but only 3 shorts, one of which is a readily available Chaplin short. Surely more than 2 ""impersonator"" shorts exist. If it had more shorts I would probably buy it. I'm sure there were several Billy West shorts released on budget VHS labels many years ago."
1,slapshot DVD,"after i received the DVD and tried to play it. it didn't play so i cleaned the machine and tried again and ,no good, it didn't play"
2,Movie,Okay movie would enjoy if you like hockey. Acting is good. Vey slow in parts. Person I got it for really like it.
1,Slap Shot Review,"The disc arrived in perfect condition, however will not play on the DVD recorder. Push play and it ejects with no message. Putting into the computer DVD drive it displays a ticked US and canada only. Australia is listed but 'in faint' and an inability to register exists. Whilst this probably is not Amazon's fault discs sold overseas should be playable.Adrian Abrahams"
4,Baldwin needs to be a little more observant!,"Um, did you perhaps fail to notice that this is an R rated movie? That usually means that there is a fair amount of coarse language, expletives, violence, nudity, etc. Just what made you think that this was a movie for children? Anyway, it's a great movie and being a *huge* Paul Newman fan, I really enjoyed seeing him in this very amusing comedy role."
1,SOPHOMORIC AND BANAL,"I wish I could say something positive about this movie but that is impossible.The humor is on a high shool level at best, and at times plumets to new depthswith offensive sexist and homophobic humor. The use of coarse language only serves to pander to the lowest strata of our society. Glamorizing violence in sports only sets a bad example for our children."
1,Not at all what I was hoping for - EITHER,"Although the story has some different twists & that was fun, it's the artwork that spurred me to write a review. What a total let down. In one case Cinderella even looks mean & ugly. What a catastrophy for a parent trying to explain that to a confused child. I think Debrah Santini is the illustrator. She really didn't do the book the justice it deserves. Another example, see the cover & notice the look of her face. I hate to put an artist down, but the word disaster comes to mind. Try to explain to you children that they should look at the beautiful drawings and not at anyone's face, yipes! Run away from this one at any price."
2,Not at all what I was hoping for,"My daughter loves the story of Cinderella, so when we found this at the library, I got it for her. We were both disappointed. It's not at all what I wanted. Cinderella is in a slightly different setting, but the story is very traditional. The only difference is that she appears to live in a 19th century city. I don't mind that. But the illustrations are completely unmagical. Cinderella scarcely looks different from anyone else in the book. I really couldn't tell which one she was in some pictures. What a let down. Find another version and don't bother with this one."
2,skylark,"I thought the first album was by far better. I'm sorry I waited so long for this, I play the first one over and over. They could have done better with this one!!!!"
2,Boring,What am I missing? This singer is GENERIC and BORING. A dime a dozen and liveless. Who needs cutesy so called jazz singers when we already have Jane and Diana. Please stop the mediocrity.
3,Disappointed,"I waited for years for this CD but have to admit,compared to the first two, this was disappointing so I don't play it much. The others I play all the time. Choice of songs is final assessment. Her voice and style are still wonderful."
3,Not nearly as Good as her previous work,"This young lady has a wonderful full voice. This CD has been in the works for a long time and now I wonder if it is the fact that it pales in comparison to her earlier works as to why they held it back. Still has a great voice, but there is definitely something missing. Hopefully there will be another CD soon that will offer, the listener, a much greater chance to hear that beautiful voice."
4,Skylark,"What an amazing voice! I hadn't heard of her before, but love this album and will definitely consider buying more of hers. The selection of songs is wonderful too."
3,"Good soundtrack, decent movie","I came across Dee Snider's Strangeland on a System of a Down site. I found out that they were on the soundtrack and deceided to rent Strangeland on DVD. I thought the movie was o.k.. It had the potential to be a really good movie but the acting was not very good and I found a few plot holes. For example, the scene where the detective found Captain Howdy's position only based on the fact that he heard a dog bark. It is also pretty unbelievable that Dee's character could have been hung in a tree for that long and not died. Anyway, other than that the movie is great. It is about gothic metal culture and that is what I like. There are a few stereotypes like the name of the club, and that all heavy metal listeners are obsessed with death. I enjoyed the soundtrack promo. I have never seen a DVD with 3 music videos on it. I was very pleased with the soundtrack... So in conclusion, the movie was o.k. but buy the soundtrack."
2,Potential horror thriller that failed,"Strangeland, the 1998 horror disaster written, produced, and starring Twisted Sister leadman Dee Snider, starts off in its first half hour as possibly the gothic Silence of the Lambs, but then it gets so dull it feels like the body pierced You've Got Mail.So Much Flesh So Little Time more like So Little Action So Much Time"
4,Good lessons to be learned here...,I don't do Horror... but his movie was not that. It did open my eyes to potential problems with teenagers and internet chatting. Dee Snider is great! the movie gets under ur skin.
3,The Best Song on This Soundtrack Is.....,"The absolutely best song on this soundtrack is ""Soul Searchin' (I Wanna Know If It's Mine)"" by Me'shell NdegeOcello. Check it out."
3,Quality varies,"A double shot of pianist-siren Amos steals the show in what was a marketable mix of (mostly) boring rap, bland R&B, and serviceable rock with a few other worthwhile contributions (Outkast circa Atliens and Rage before Evil Empire dropped to name the obvious ones) made this album enticing when it was released."
3,Not A Very Good Sountrack,"The only reason I give this soundtrack 3 stars is because of Tori Amos, and the wonderful Eve's Plum song. This soundtrack isn't that great, but the movie was wonderful...."
4,SPOOOOOOON!,"I was also disappointed that this dvd ommitted an episode. Last year I had purchased a Helios up converter dvd player that plays all regions. (or should I say it is a region free player?)I'm happy to say that the UK version of this title has ALL 13 episodes!!!There are no extras, the set is quite plain, but at least I have them all on disc. I've already pre-ordered season 2, which ALSO has ALL 13 episodes from that season. It seems there are quite a few UK released movies that have 2 disc sets, more features, extras, etc. Even alternate endings that we DON'T get in the States! I still buy US versions in most cases, but Amazon UK is worth checking out."
3,Disappointing.....,"When I heard that the Tick animated series was coming to DVD, I was initially psyched, seeing as how I've been getting tired of watching my poor quality VHS and DVD-R versions. However, upon its release, I was a bit disgruntled, seeing as how we only get 12 out of the 13 episodes from the first season (The Tick Vs. The Mole Men is omitted from this release, without much reason given), and there are no bonus features. We're talking BARE BONES here, citizens. Aside from that, on the copy I received, the first 4 seconds of audio are missing from 7 out of the 8 episodes on the first disc (I haven't gotten to Disc 2 yet). This was delayed for years, and I'm trying to figure out why, seeing as how this release seems like it was thrown together at the last minute. Hopefully, the studio will try a little harder if and when Season 2 sees the light of day."
3,"Good, but later seasons great","I bought this for a friend who is crazy about The Tick. Upon viewing it, he said that he now knew that the later seasons of the cartoon were better than the first one. If you need a tick fix until they are released, go buy the live action series."
5,Its The Tick!,"If you have seen the show you know how funny it is. The collection is apparently missing episode 11, though I can't recall what that one was anyway, but there are 12 episodes to enjoy."
4,Great acting but script changes disappointed me,"The acting was great but the changes made to the original detract from the greatness of this movie. The father (who is the Persian in the original) shooting Eric at the end is awful -the whole conversion and transformation of Eric due to the unselfish love of Christine and his peaceful death in the orginal is very poweful. Much of the contrast and tension of the original is lost. Eric was never loved by anyone including his mother - that is why Christine's love for him at the end is so transforming. Oh well, the acting is great and the balance of horror and comedy is present throughout."
4,best version so far - innaccurate but pretty good,"I am a huge phantom phan, and this is probably the best non musical movie version of Phantom yet! it is highly innaccurate though and didnt exactly follow that close 2 the book. charles dance and teri polo did a very good job in their characters. there is no Raoul - his name is Phillipe instead. christine and raoul were childhood friends, but christine was his servant! you never see Erik's face - not once. And the former manager of the opera was Erik's father. Erik's mother loved him and was a famous opera singer. as you can see, they totally ruined his backround, and Erik was NEVER Christine's angel of music!!!! But other than that, it was enjoyable and entertaining."
1,Hardly worth refuting,"I'll keep this short.I'm an atheist. I've read several apologetic works relating the resurrection. I don't agree with any of them. This, however, is by far the weakest. If you want a resurrection apologetic, read Gary Habermas or William Lane Craig. If you want one aimed at a more popular audience, read Lee Strobel. Do not, however, read this book."
4,Nice fit,This shirt feels awesome on due to the combination of lycra and cotton. The only downfall is it will shrink if you put it in the dryer too long. Suggest you either buy a size larger or don't put it in the dryer...
1,It was fixed with junk sony pieces,"Thing didn't work the first day I got it, I fixed it for a couple months.Turns out the inside motor for the dvd was replaced with sony partsI also found out this part from sony was a problem with several dvd playersPiece of *&$@# lasted 4 monthsNICE"
1,"DO NOT, repeat, DO NOT buy this program","[...] I thought installation problems only happened to other people, not to me. The program crashes upon installation! It is a waste of time trying to fix it and a big hassle. Repeat: DO NOT BUY THIS PROGRAM!!!"
1,Lawsuit waiting to happen,"Filed my taxes in February with TaxCut Deluxe. Just got my state tax return sent back to me saying that I had failed to fill out large chunks of my tax return. When I examined what TaxCut had filled out, it left out complete columns. When I started to do the tax return by hand, it became clear that TaxCut failed not only fill things out, but also filled out parts of the form incorrectly. It got the standard deduction wrong (to the tune of 2 grand).""Customer Support"" was what I have grown to expect with companies. Completely non-responsive. When I had problems with the program earlier I was told that I could expect all fixes to come in the future. The program told me that I could e-file my state tax return, but when I tried to do it, I was told that I could not. I contacted customer support and they said I could return it for a refund IF I still had the original box and receipt (this for a program I bought in January)."
2,Disappointing but easy to use.,I have purchased previous versions of TaxCut but I was not happy with this one. The software had to be updated on-line and most of the updates weren't ready until late February. There were errors when you tried to update through the software so you had to go to the website to manually download them. [...]
1,Won't install,"Same problem [...] - installation fails while trying to install a file named mmvdpro.swf. No help on TaxCut website. Used TurboTax in past but bought this because significantly cheaper. More evidence, I guess, that you get what you pay for."
2,Lost functionality from last year,"In 2004 I actually used both TurboTax and TaxCut. They found different deductions, which made the extra cost more than worthwhile. Overall, TaxCut was more intuitive and found more deductions.In 2005 they stopped allowing downloading of 1099s from financial institutions such as Fidelity. Once I found that out, I stopped using the product; it won't save me any time."
1,Useless Software,"When loading the program, it asked whether the copy was illegal, and my cursor just happened to be resting on the ""yes"" box. Without even selecting the yes or no, the program automatically selected the yes, and the software simply stopped. No way to correct the selection...Just had to toss out the whole thing. What a crappy way to cheat buyers."
1,Stay away from Tax Cut,"I wish I read all the reviews before purchasing. Just like many others, my installation failed on mmvdpro.swf. I chatted the supprt, and they cut and paste a bunch of support options for me to call. Idiots! Not worth the headache or rise in blood pressure! I had to give it at least one star, but I would really say it was a big fat ZERO."
3,Interesting.,"Butterflies are Free is about a young blind man who wants to live on his own and declare his independence. Goldie Hawn and Eileen Heckart make up the supporting cast, they give excellent performances. This movie is based on play so don't expect a lot of scenery changes. Good movie but not brilliant, and if you don't mind watching Goldie Hawn walk around in her bra and panties for half of the film, give it a viewing. Enjoy!"
3,Love Comedy,"Based on the play of the same name this is the story of a blind youmg man,Don Baker(Edward Albert) who has his mind set to make his own life for himself despite his handicap. He leaves the security of his parent's home and takes an apartment in San Francisco; he promises his mother(Eileen Heckart)that if he cannot make it on his own in three months he will return home. His first acquaintance is his next door neighbor, Jill Tanner(Goldie Hawn), an aspiring actress; she is enthralled with his sense of humor and they become fast friends and lovers. This ideal situation is wrecked, naturally by his overpowering, overly protective mother and the fact that Jill lands a job and the producer wants her to perform not only on screen or stage but also off screen or stage."
2,Has some glitches,I have been watching this and have found some glitches in the CD. I am hoping that I can clean them up.
3,"Very good show, very poor production house","First the show. Good stories with interesting characters. A friend got me hooked on it, then I got stationed in Japan. I bought the DVD's to catch up. ***** 5 stars.Onto the production value of the DVD's. Pretty interface, but no subtitles and cheesy extras. Really little more than the episodes themselves. *** 3 stars.Finally, the production house. They release a box set for every complete series they produce. Patient consumers have learned to wait for that set, staying away from more expensive individual DVD's. It must be effecting sales, because the press release comes out, ""we will not release a box set,"" they say. Then, as always, the box set comes. This falls into the ENRON style business practice. ZERO stars.The final tally comes out to my rating. *** 3 stars."
3,after the fact...,You can tell years had passed between the series and movie.So did the interest of the actors in the character performance.
3,"oh, well.","This episode demonstrates clearly what a useless human being Crichton is. Oh, wait. Not useless. Harmful. Although, I can say that, somewhat, about every crew member there, he's the worst of the bunch. And why I find watching this series so painful at times.Not only does he take apart critical systems that are not broken, because he's bored, he ignores crewmembers that are clearly in distress, which causes an entire chain of events that never should have happened if he weren't there, at all.The otherwise interesting crew, is made to suffer. I guess the show would not have lasted as long without him, but with another crew member instead, it may have lasted even longer. There are some really good stories here, and the scifi aspects of the show are out of this world!"
5,Great show.,"I was skeptical about this show but after getting into a few episodes I was hooked. Many people can not get passed the initial acting or lack there seems in the beginning but it really gets better into the second and third seasons. I had caught a few episodes when I was younger and I was interested in the show but seemed hard to find the time to watch it then. After buying the first season I was hooked on the show, now I own the whole set on blu ray. The biggest issue I have had with the blu ray is the screen resolution being in standard not wide, you can fix this on most newer televisions by putting it in wide zoom mode. Bottom line great show."
3,S'Okay...A Small Group Leader's Review...,"I don't know. Maybe I killed it. Maybe I shouldn't have cautioned people about slipping into denomination bashing upfront.Either way...the conversation for Sunday did not go as well as for the first three Noomas.I think Sunday is strong, though again like Trees, it does not have the best cinematography of the Noomas. The people walking by are a little distracting. The fact that there are phones in the booths but that they never get used and waitresses seem to be swarming is also an issue.God's message from Isaiah chapter 1 is one of my favorite pieces of scripture. I don't know if it was my leading, the weakness of this Nooma, or a mixture of both--whatever it was--I feel a disservice was done somewhere along the line in the meeting in which we watched and talked about Sunday.While I still contend that the Noomas are some of the greatest small group resources out there, I can't quote swing a full recommendation for this one."
4,My 5 yr. old daughter loves it!,"I purchased the toy for my daughters 5th birthday, not because Sponge Bob is necessarily the cutiest toy, but because she loves the character. It was a nice surprise to find that not only does the toy talk when you squeeze his hand, but when you squeeze his nose and flip his upper lip. Three sources of interaction make this toy worth it."
5,good history,"The book describes and compares the tactics, weapons and philosophies of both sides and also provides interesting biographies of the major players of the air war. The detailed descriptions and development histories of the various planes were very interesting and the numerous maps and diagrams help to make the text very understandable. There are many myths, such as the belief that the Germans did not have radar, that are dispelled in this excellent book."
5,As usual....,Julie Andrews never let's you down. How can one be so sophisticated and polite and make such comedy?!?! GENIUS!!! That's how!!! I recommend this movie to all!!!
5,Julie - 'Hot'.,"To the point:There is music, dance, comedy! What more could you want from this Blake Edward's classic! The more I see this film, the more I appreciate how cleverly the Broadway team changed this film into a Broadway show or how certain lines or scenes were fit into the Broadway musical like a seamless work of art. In addition to Julie, in this film there was Robert Preston and James Gardner, Lesley Ann Warren, all of whom contribute to this film's successful chemistry.Oh how I love this crazy film!! And Robert Preston! What an actor! What a voice! We will so miss you!! Check out Robert Preston in The Music Man."
1,Did we watch the same film?,"Maybe I'm not sophisticated enough to find this amusing or clever, but I was reminded of Hemingway's statement throughtout ""Never mistake motion for action."" There is a lot of motion in this film, but it is dying, like fish floundering in those buckets at open-air markets. And with stupendously wooden performances and coincidences so outlandish as to be irritating, I never felt anything above annoyed, and certainly felt more than annoyed in many scenes.When the end mercifully arrived (is this movie six, or is it seven, hours long?), and I was supposed to laugh at Robert Preston playing Julie Andrews, I watched in a combination of shock and awe. Who would find this funny (apparently many people, judging by the reviews here). And who would try such a stupid scene? Blake Edwards hit the big time with some wonderfully talented people helping him, but this sterile, phony, insincere and stupid film is a waste on all levels."
1,"Horrible Viewing Angle, Too Dark","I strongly discourage anyone from buying this photo frame.The screen is too dark, and raising the brightness makes the whole screen whiter, washing out the picture. You will also not be able to see the image unless your are standing to the right of the frame and looking down. The viewing angle is sooo small that you will almost never be able to see the picture as you are walking past it. You have to stop and make sure the viewing angle is right to be able to see the picture as it would look on a computer screen.In addition, the screen started flickering horribly after about 5 months, needing warranty repair. It would stop flickering if the photo frame was left turned off for a few hours, but would come back after a few hours of being turned on.New photo frames are comming that are cheaper, have better viewing angles and higher resolution. I strongly suggest you wait for those."
3,Significant downgrade from last year,"I need this product in order to file an estate income tax return. In a significant change from last year, the product can no longer do your own personal tax returns (1040). So now you have to end up buying two tax software packages.Also, it's substantially higher priced than other TaxCut software and doesn't have a rebate.Like before it assumes are relatively sophisticated (tax-wise) and will know what forms you need. This is a safe assumption given the target audience for this software, but a first time user will be somewhat stunned as to how less user-friendly it is than the personal TaxCut versions."
1,Please don't waste your money,I purchased this product instead of TurboTax because it was a few dollars cheaper. Guess what.. I'm now buying TurboTax because I simply don't trust this software. I have an accounting degree and have been doing my personal and business taxes for years now. Save your money!! Buy TurboTax.
1,REALL REALLY BAD,"THIS IS TERRIBLE SOFTWARE. There is supposed to be a 60 day guarantee on this - but all I got was lots of time on hold. They say it but don't mean it.BAD BAD software - mismatched numbers and forms, etc.Buy another brand or just get the fill in form from the IRS. Much better than this garbage. DON'T BUY THIS - YOU WILL PROBABLY BE SORRY!!!!"
1,"Zero stars, worst product I have seen in 15 years",The original DOS version of TurboTax beat this bloody. I can't believe H&R Block put their name on this product. It is an embarrassment to a shocking degree.
2,A disappointing read,"The story took ages to develop and this slowed the book down. The characters were well developed, but the outcome of the story was not in line with the general narrative flow. It required a deus ex machina, if you like."
3,Be cautious of lightheadedness,"I have immense respect for Jerry Cantrell. I saw him give a stellar solo performance in Seattle last Halloween. But dammit, that hair swinging makes you dizzy after 40 min. The metal affectations don't end there -- you'll see crotch-hugging pants, choppy 15-frames per second video effects, and a seemingly endless supply of onstage mist. Mike Starr's flannel shirt is the only hint of the grunge repackaging to follow a year later. That being said, the performance is terrific (although a bit rote) and the recording is excellent. Accept it for what it is: a 1990 artifact. Strictly for completists or AIC novices."
1,WARNING! THIS IS NOT A DIRECT REPLACEMENT!!! WARNING!,"This battery is NOT a direct replacement for an APC RBC4! The APC battery is 3.698"" high, this battery is 3.759"" high and WILL NOT fit into the APC UPS battery compartment! Buy it at your own risk, you have been warned! I, rather than go through the hassle of hauling this battery 10 miles to the UPS Store, took my Dremmel tool and modified the battery compartment to accomodate this battery. It was a mess, but less hassle than taking it to UPS for return. I am very, very sorry I didn't spring for an ORIGINAL APC battery. Do yourself a favor, pay the little extra and get a Genuine APC battery!"
4,A practical book for Communications,"This book is a graduate level textbook for Communications, yet can be utilized at a beginner professional level. It gives clear and concise tips on communication, analytical thinking and writing."
3,Pretty but superficial,"Collections of brief sketches of the monarchs of Britain have long been a popular theme for British publishers; most of them, being repetitious and superficial, are not considered in this bibliography, but Delderfield's is much more popular than most. Much more coverage is given to recent sovereigns -- those, presumably, of more interest to readers -- and biographies of earlier figures are extremely brief. Bare facts of events are given but not often the causes behind them. The nicely reproduced portraits are those, mostly from the National Portrait Gallery, that appear in every other book. While this volume might make a nice gift for an adolescent reader with an interest in royalty, it will be of little interest to serious students."
2,"Cadfael on Acorn Media a ""bummer.""","The video and audio qualities of this DVD are appalling! Yes, the main menu is crisp and compelling, but what follows will send you scrambling for your home-taped VHS copy of the production. I have noticed similar lapses of quality in other DVD copies of great British productions (e.g., Sherlock Holmes w/Jeremy Brett). A great performance deserves at the very least a good technical effort. (Note: The A&E issues of Poirot are excellent.)"
3,"Unfortunately, I agree with the negative reviews","Unfortunately, I agree with the overwhelmingly negative reviews. I also did not like the actor who played the sheriff as much as the usual actor, thought that the story dragged, and I was able to identify the culprit and why he did what he did because it was very like other Cadfael dramas. But, having said this, I still found the story somewhat interesting."
2,"Classic Bo Diddley, no Chuck Berry",The only footage of Chuck Berry here seems to show him refusing to perform his songs for some reason. A little bizzare given the title of the DVD.
5,The Bo Diddley Show,"Yes indeed, this is all about Bo Diddley and his all star band. Indeed, Mr. Berry is relegated to all star status like Mick Fleetwood and others. But once you get past the misleading title it is great music with good backstory."
3,"Good, not great","I paid about $450 for this printer. Had I paid much more than that, I wouldn't have much good to say about it. But for that price, it is a solid value and I'm happy with it.I like the duplexing feature and paper handling generally. It has a pretty big footprint, and you have to be careful about the paper tray which hangs out in front when in use. It is all too easy to whack it if you're in cramped quarters and that can cause problems with the printer.It caused me some problems with conflicts with other printer drivers that I've had to devise some workarounds for. Print quality is OK. I've been a bit displeased with the print quality of late, but I am not using genuinely overpriced HP toner cartridges, so I have to acknowledge that might be the problem there. But I'm buying knock off cartridges that work very well for about 25% of what the HP carts go for.If you can but it cheap enough, as I and others have done, it's a good printer for the money."
4,Needs NOT VISTA COMPATIBLE Warning Otherwise great,"No amount of fiddling, using the printer install disk or downloads from HP seems to be able to make this printer talk with my new HP Laptop with Vista.Vista does not recognize the printer, the software in the package apparently does not talk to Vista and the downloads thus far have been useless. And yes I know the first mistake was buying a Vista OS computer.By way of comparison, it took about 3 minutes to have it up and running with my XP Professional desktop. Since I put the Vista computer in the closet the HP printer has performed flawlessly running XP. Great printer in terms of quality and speed. Perfect for the office or home office.Update, thousands of pages later the printer is still working great. Vista is long gone. The world is great."
4,One of our family's favorites.,This is a hilarious movie! The manic energy of Robin Williams and the quiet dry humor of Walter Mathua make a wonderful contrast. Our whole family enjoys this movie and the characters that inhabit the story.
1,Weak script makes it impossible for great actors to shine,"I had high hopes for the pairing of Walter Matthau and Robin Williams, but I was very disappointed.The actors are brilliant--among my very favorites--but I felt their talent was squandered on a poor script and poor direction. I watched this with a friend who is also a fan of both actors, and we sat mostly groaning rather than laughing.I wasn't hoping for anything deep--just a few hours of good fun, but at least for me, this movie didn't deliver.Given the dozens of wonderful Walter Matthau movies available, this is one to skip. If you want a really good belly laugh with Walter Matthau, try the Sunshine Boys!"
2,Take it or leave it,"These guys were great once, but get their old stuff not this CD, it does have some good ideas for grooves if you play delta blues, but the skills are a little on the low side, sorry yall........"
3,book,Great book but I don't like the way it is organized. Too much flipping from one section to the next.
4,DS fan writting a review,"The movie was understandably dark. I got it because I'm a DS fan and I wanted to see him in it. He was in the whole thing. The rating had only to do with it's dark theme. Otherwise, it would have been five."
5,Cover is what I expected,The cover is what I expected. Luckily the GBA's color that I have is the same as the cover.The cost is very reasonable and shipping is very quick.
5,Not your average collection.,"Pastis is a genius even if he is a lawyer. Not since Calvin n Hobbes have I laughed as much at a comic strip. I hope to see Pearls continue to invade Cathy, Family Circus etc. This strip is a nice break from the insanity called life."
4,I love it--terrible puns delivered by poorly drawn cartoon animals,"This is a bizarre little cartoon with a great warped sense of humor. One warning; if you don't like puns and word play, this isn't for you, because this book has some of the worst puns I've ever read. Very clever.The two main characters are Rat and Pig. Pig is sweet, naive and more than a little stupid. Rat on the other hand smokes, drinks and is arrogant as well as slightly psychotic. Other characters pop up like Zebra who has had numerous friends and relatives eaten by lions. These animals go to work and go out on dates, and make political and social statements that only cartoon animals can get away with. Pearls Before Swine is along the same lines as Bloom County and Far Side. It's not at that level yet, but is well on its way."
2,Not impressed!,"I just purchased this DVD based on the reviews, but I really didn't care for it...at all. Minimal ab work, and just plain boring. Save your money and just do some squats and lunges, knee raises, side kicks and box steps. Throw in a few (very few) crunches & push ups and there you have it. Now stretch & repeat the next time you want this workout. I have tons of exercise DVD's and this one is one of the worst in my collection, luckily I purchased at an auction website for very little cost to me."
5,crunch review,This video totally kicks your butt..its starts with a stong thigh work out and keeps on going.. you defenalty wont be able to finish the video the first time you watch it..
5,Great workout,This is a really good workout because it is a great combination of strength work and cardio. The instructor is upbeat and encouraging. I highly recommend this DVD.
4,Catchy Tunes!,"Yes, she's definitely the Queen of Retro-Dance. ""Good Girl"", ""Favorite Things"", ""Kiss it all Goodbye""..... are among my favorites that I used to play all the time. Stacey's got a great soothing voice that just makes you feel good and want to dance, but she can do slow songs just as well. I personally like Better Than Heaven more that Hard Machine, because I really liked the tracks that were NOT ""hits."" A great album to me is one where quality of the ""other"" songs (the ones that didn't make in the charts)add to the overall enjoyment and value (their not just ""fillers""). All in all, Hard Machine is a great album with catchy tunes you will enjoy!Take a listen and you'll be singing along.I saw her in person back in the mid 80's........and she really puts on a show!! She faded away too soon like other artists, but I haven't forgetten about her!!"
5,You can't forget Sugarfoot!,Sugarfoot of the Ohio Players put out a solo album in the 1980's...does anyone out there know where I can purchase it?
5,Great,Was very pleased with item and delivery was prompt. Well packaged. Can't think of anything else to say about the produce as it satisfied my needs.
3,rock and roll noir,"being a huge fan of penn and teller, i was going to buy the book no matter what, so i am a bit biased. the book reads like film noir, hardboiled, erratic film noir. if you know lots of song lyrics the book will mean more to you, otherwise you won't understand some of the lines in the book. i like how he fits song lyrics into the story and they seem to fit well. a good story, well written, at times almost ""too much"" but it stays interesting and fun. about a third of the way in a rythm develops, the story takes over, and it's got you. has some good bits of philosophy, some interesting insights (""i didn't lose my parents, i know where they are, they are dead""), and is pretty fun. a good beach book or rainy saturday type book."
1,"Bocce, Daniele",No tree should have been cut down to print this. I wanted to know how to play bocce and how to build a court. This book did not satisfy my needs.
5,JUST REED IT,"If you feel that you can appreciate anything that goes a little bit outside of your ""normal"" perception of people and life itself, then you should definetly read this book. I tend to agree with Mr. Diffenbaugh. The dialog is so f'n great. This Philip J. Reed is a genius. My only fear is that he will pass us by unnoticed, and under appreciated by the rest of the world, that is, until its too late. Please, I beg you, if you are even just a little bit smart, can take a few jokes, and, can of course read, buy it. If you don't, well, shame on you. In the UNLIKELY event that you don't like it, refer to David's review!On behalf of all your fans, I would like to thank you Phil."
3,Beware - not made by American Battery Co.,Received the RBC11 pack. The product picture and title showed American Battery Co. but the shipped batteries were Sigmas made in Vietnam.Edit: forgot to mention that I bought from Powerwarehouse.
5,Nice,Works identical to the old APC batteries i had. It connected perfectly and works great. Saved a significant amount of money on it as well.
3,incorrect return policy,"i had a ups model sua2200 , unfortunately i had bought a battery set compatible with su2200the su2200 used rbc 11 , while the sua2200 used rbc 55 . though the dimensions of the batteries are similar , the connectors are different. so i purchased the batteries from amazon. the shipping was fast and accurate. but when i found out i ordered the wrong batteries i called amazon support to return the batteries... they labelled the batteries as hazardous and said it would be dangerous for them to receive on their warehouses. so they offered me half the price to keep the batteries.so i am stuck with batteries i cant use, and i am charged half ...if only this was mentioned in the product description.i could have felt better."
1,A waste of Ten Bucks!,"Sinatra fans don't be tempted by the cheap price. This DVD should have never been mastered. The ""Documentary"" with poor footage, lousy photos, very few snipits of music, none of which is in sync with the random pictures we see, make this the disaster of all times. The editor should hang his head in shame !"
5,Clarity at last!,"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Ronald Hutton, for clearing up all the murky waters surrounding the current Wicca craze. Having been in and out of a ""coven,"" as part of an ongoing exploration of religions, I can now see that my natural skepticism had its foundations in truth. I'm so relieved to know where all this claptrap came from, and that it has little or no relation to the ancient Celtic pagan religion. I agree with Hutton that it's fine for people to make up their religions, just let them be honest about it. I also appreciated Hutton's discussion concerning the difference between religion and magic. Other reviewers have called this work ""dry"", but I was fascinated to the last page--not tempted to skip a line. Would that the author would turn his considerable talents to the exploration of the folklore and magic of other cultures!"
3,For History Only,"I forgot the language in this movie was so bad. It was an older movie, so it surprised me! Otherwise, I pretty good show if you want it for a history lesson."
5,A music fan from Washington D.C.,This is a great CD.I would reccomend it to any one that's down.This cd is tight!
3,All for Angie!,"As a ""B"" movie and a storyline, this one is about 2 Stars. However, as it shows some of the most explicit topless scenes of former model Angie Everhart, it's still(!) easily worth the price of admission. I'm a huge Angie E fan, even though her movies tend to not be very good and they're always way outside of the mainstream.Daniel Baldwin is the least well known of the 3 Baldwin brothers (and yes, there are 3 of them). Brothers Alec and William have been regular movies for years. Daniel, meanwhile, has never broken through. He's always in ""B"" movies and Sy Fy channel movies. The one edge he has on his 2 brothers is that he can say he starred in a movie opposite the gorgeous Angie Everhart!The plot of this film is rather convoluted, but there is a decent amount of skin (not just Angie) to justify your picking it up. Angie is certainly the hottest redhead Thespian in Hollywood since Tawny Kitean was in her prime, so that alone makes this movie a must-have for fans of redheaded women!"
2,Disappointed,"This film should have been marketed as a drama. It sure wasn't horror. I think the monsters were in the wrong movie: they kept showing up, but no one gave them anything to do."
1,Where's Candace!,"Sorry folks, but this remake of a horror classic is an absolute joke! Nothing in this bubblegum flick could remotely compare to the original (or the beautiful Candace Hilligoss!)"
2,If only.,"This book could have been so much better. If only the author didn't rush the ending that way. The relationship in this book between Ruby and Daphne was fasinating and engaging. This book could have been as beautiful and intriguing as Dive by Stacey Donavan. But instead the author took the easy way out. If you want to know how, read the book. But prepare to be disapointed and let down."
3,Slightly disappointed and confused,"After waiting a long time for U2 to finally release some thing on DVD I was disappoited when they finally did. Songs that are listed as DVD bonus tracks on the disc arent there! The grainy black and white video is out of place with DVDs purpose of razor sharp images. Musically this is a great disc but visually their concerts are better than this. Aside from ""With or without you"" and ""Sunday, bloody Sunday"" I have a hard time recommending this disc to anyone. Lets hope ""Live at Red Rocks"" comes out soon."
1,"""This song Charles Manson stole from the Beatles, now we're stealing it back"" LOL","Bono's attempt to cover the Beatles Helter-Skelter is incredibly amateur. He can't get the timing or the lyrics right. Why would he film himself doing a song when he doesn't know the words? Compare Bono's take on Helter-Skelter to the original if you get a chance. If you know the song it is worth a good laugh.Bono is the last person who should be remaking Beatles songs for profit. Bono has pompously compared his inept, politically motivated band to the Beatles. The Beatles had 27 Number 1 hits in 7 Years. U2 have 6 Number 1 hits in 30 years (4 UK and 2 US Billboard Hot 100) The Beatles did it in 7 years if U2 were going to be the next Beatles they missed the window back in the eighties. I am sure all the hardcore U2 fans hate to hear it but the facts are in the hits."
1,U2 Rattle and Hum,I am on my second order for this disc and niether of the discs will load in any of my DVD players. I think there is a manufacturing issue.
5,A great Blu Ray disc from Paramount!,"This is a great Blu Ray Disc from Paramount,much better than the standard DVD,I was lucky enough to find it on sale for the same price as the DVD so I went Blu Ray and I was not dissapointed,the extras are the pretty much the same as the DVD though!!! A recommended Blu Ray title for the U2 fan!!!By the way,this title was briefly out of print due to the HD Blu Ray War,but since Blu Ray was the victor it's now available again to the retail public!!! A+"
5,A Biased fan's review,"Let me start this by saying that U2 is my favorite band and that I would buy any album that they put out, even if it was absolutely terrible (although I can't see that happening!). And, not surprisingly, I loved Rattle and Hum. If you have any interest in U2, I'm guessing you will too. Highlights of the film are the spectacular live versions of ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"", ""With or Without You"", ""Bullet the Blue Sky"", and ""Where the Streets Have No Name"". It's hard not to get caught up in U2's trip across America. The film is mostly concert footage, there's not a whole lot of interviews with the band or anything, but the concert footage alone makes this DVD well worth the money. A masterpiece."
2,Just get the DVD,"This is old video that looks like old video. There are some good quality tracks worthy of Blu-ray but all in all, I was quite dissapointed. Hey, it's not the music that is poor it's the quality of the videos, if you got it on DVD, don't waste your money to upgrade."
2,Mixed up,"II'm watching the first season with a friend, and what I find most glaring is that, compared to the broadcast sequencing on the IMDB, the discs have the stories way out of order!"
5,Brillant,"Each episode of Farscape is like a movie, and that is what first attracted me to the series. Beyond the visually stunning surface is a complex storyline with amazingly developed characters. Each episode is well-written and beautifully acted. I would recommend this series not just to those who enjoy sci-fi, but to anyone who enjoys character driven stories. This is, in my opinion, the best show ever made for television."
5,The best SCI- FI show ever created,Since the first season Farscape has been widely reconfigured in Hollywood and the movie industry as the most complete Sci-fi show ever to be created. A perfect cast of character to which ever viewer can relate and a great underlying story overlapping adventurous episodes. The cancellation of this show after only 4 seasons is a terrible injustice and will go on in history to reflect a period where people would rather watch degrading reality shows over creative and quality programming.
4,"Great show, mediocre DVD","My comments relate to the DVD, not the show itself (which I really enjoy):Problem 1) Lots of add junk before the menu comes up. Each has it's own track, so you have to do a lot of skipping to get to the menu.Problem 2) There are two episodes per DVD, but the menu doesn't let you go directly to the second episode. You have to play and then skip through the first.Problem 3) No subtitles. If you're running sound through a stereo, not the TV and thus can't use CC, you're out of luck if you just don't get what that alien said...."
5,"Buy 'em, cause no more new ones","Farscape is without doubt one of the best science fiction, or fiction, TV shows to ever grace the airways. Darkly funny, serious, passionate, exciting, intriguing, and intelligent are just a few of the adjectives that could describe this series. Unfortunately, the Sci Fi channel has decided recently to cancel the show's 5th season. So after a hiatus, the remaining episodes of season 4 and these DVDs will be all that remains of Farscape, so buy 'em all. You won't regret it."
4,You've got to be freakin' kidding me!!!,"$150 list price, and it's not even widescreen?! I ordered the first three seasons, just assuming it had to be widescreen for that premium price. That's my only disappointment - sticking a 5-star show on a 3-star DVD format is a major let-down. Even though I only paid $75/season(shop around online - don't get ripped off), I expected a DVD with all the bells and whistles.About the show - it just keeps getting better with each season. Believe me, if you are a sci-fi fan, it's worth suffering through the substandard DVD."
3,Lost points for the price!!,"Awesome show... loved it while it aired. But with other Sci-Fi shows priced as low as $35 US for an entire first season, why on earth would I want to pay $100 more for this show? I'll buy cheaper sets and rent Farscape online, thank you very much."
1,Check out the Starburst Edition before buying this,"Now that the Starburst Edition of Farscape Season One is available - for approximately x1.5 of the price of this set of 6 episodes you can get the whole 22 episodes of season one.In addition watching the whole season lets you see how the characters and the relations between them develop - which is one of the things that makes Farscape such a good series (The 1 star is for the packaging, I'd give Farscape 5 stars)."
5,I'm eagerly awaiting Season 2,"This is simply the best series on TV. The mixture of interesting characters and humor (they never take themselves too seriously) makes it a delightful show. Plus it doesn't hurt that there are some lovely ladies on the show (Officer Aereyn Sun to name one).A Friday time slot, however, was always difficult. I missed alot of them and am looking forward to seeing Farscape in its entirety. Got Season 1 and now eagerly anticipating Season 2."
1,Excellent Show... Horrible Price!,"I love Farscape,but this price is insane for a tv series set. They would sell ALOT more at a lower price."
4,Entertaining!,this is one of those shows that just makes you go WHAT? every few minutes but mostly in part to Ben Bowder. I really enjoyed it although seeing it the first time it took some getting used to. Interesting story with mostly likeable people and some very not so likeable people. Overall a fun series to watch for mindlessness.
1,Don't buy this item!,"Don't buy this product. Merchant has misrepresented this product, claims it is compatible with RBC8. The RBC8 has T2 connectors, but this product has T1 connectors. Mixing connectors is a serious hazzard when using high power UPS devices such as what this is intended for. STAY AWAY."
5,Fun!,"This book was just so much fun to read. Anna is a great character, and so is Cammie, the bad girl of the book. I felt like I was right there in the story, and even though the end left me wanting more, I can understand that because I think this is a series like Gossip Girl. Anna has great adventures and a hot romance. What could be more fun that that? I have a cousin in Los Angeles and she says that the book has a lot of real locations. All in all, read this book!"
4,What more could you want?,"'The O.C'in a book! I'm not much of a reader- if I'm not hooked by the second page, I get bored! If you are hard to impress, like myself, this is the book for you. Completely engaged in the book from the start, it's a terrific read! The main character Anna falls for this georgeous, funny, rich guy who she met on a plane journey to California. They instantly click and he invites her to an A-List party. Arterwards they set sail on a beautiful yacht where they ""get to know each other"" - or so we are lead to believe! By the end of the book we realise that he is nothing special but just an average (cruel, emotionless, annoying)little boy!"
5,Amazingly Interesting,"Once I started reading this novel, I couldn't put it down. It was a constant rollercoaster right from the start. I recommend this book to anyone! It was great! It gave a true picture of what some high schoolers are really like. I liked the way in which the main character didn't let her guard down and trusted her instincts."
2,Wanna-Be Gossip Girl,"This book reminded me a LOT of the Gossip Girls series, only the characters seemed a bit younger. It was an imitation, and everyone knows that imitations can't be as good as the original. Gossip Girl books have the whole ritzy, exciting life going for them. A-List don't have that as much. I found it difficult to relate to the characters, and did not enjoy it at all. If you've never read Gossip Girl books, then this could work for you-- you wouldn't compare the two. But if you have... don't bother. You'll only be comparing them and not really reading the book at all."
5,very good,"I thought this book was VERY GOOD. Gossip Girl has to be one of my favorite books. Although this wasn't as good as Gossip Girl it is still a great book. It is about a 17-year-old girl named Anna and she moves to L.A. because her sister is in Rehab and her mother is in Venice, Italy. So she has to move in with her father in L.A. who has totally changed since the last time she saw him. She has to leave her best frined Cyn(Cynthia) who is free spirited and very confident (gets all the guys) So Annd tries to be more like her. This book is about her trials and tribulations as she tries to be more 'cyn-like'. She falls in love with this guy ben and he invites her to a movie star wedding. they have a long night together and she thinks he is the one until something happens... (...)"
3,It falls short.,"Some say The A-List is better than the Gossip Girl series... The A-List only has two books in the series so far, and compared to GG, I'd perfer GG over this any day. I'm not saying that TAL is a horrible book, but it falls short of an actual plot. I believe it's like a try-hard GG, which, really, isn't that of a good read then.I think this book focuses a little too much on its main character, and even for the main character, there really isn't so much said about her. In GG, each of the main characters have their own story. In TAL, each of the main characters come off as too snotty or too cool to be there. The ending was the ultimate downfall of this book, though I know there's a sequel.It really lacked plot and some things seemed too repetitive."
1,Awful,"I have read a multitude of teen books, and this one has to be the worst of them. I despised and was disgusted with Anna, who is in fact the protagonist. She came off as a total fake, someone who we're supposed to think is different than the rest of the ""rich kids"" because she feels sorry for poor people. It was a total waste of time and I'm sorry I ever picked up this plotless book. If you must read books like these, turn to Gossip Girls instead. The writing is at least a little bit better, and it still has that ""rich-mean-girl-sex-and-lies"" element. Better yet, read The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, a teen read which beats out this book by a million miles."
3,Less Interesting,"I personal think that when The A-List is compared to The Gossip Girl Novels it is a little less interesting, in the way that it seemed to take more time to become interested in what was going on unlike in gossip girl there are so many things going on at once right from the start you find it hard to become bored. But overall I think that it is a decent book."
3,Beach Read,"A nice quick read from a debut author. Although the story was intresting and the pages flew by quickly, the authors fails to display any cohesive descriptions or well developed plot. If you're in the mood to read something that requires no thinking, I suggest you pick this up. It's full of details about designer clothes, cars and the lifestyle of the A-list. Hence the name. Definitely a read for teens, who can really relate to Anna's problems with her family, friends, and issues with school."
3,very average,"plotless. dry. there are many other words to describe dean's THE A-LIST, but most of them are too foul for FCC regulations.The book is basically one girl's journey through L.A, while she falls in love with the wrong guy and gets on the bad side of the ""a-list"": bitchy Cammie, insecure Sam, and oversexed pseudo-hippie dee. when i first bought it and read it, i thought wow, this is like MEAN GIRLS, when it's really not. rereading it, it seemed boring, unfunny, and not even in the LEAST way similar to Gossip Girl, it's obvious parent.there's a line between catty and stupid. THE A-LIST is neither."
2,Tricky Tricky,"I love light teen books all about love, well this book isn't flatly just isn't, it had be hooked in the beginning, all about Anna the girl who wanted to change herself, she did this by going to California, on her way she meets this perfect for her guy (cough cough perfect cough cough) well he turns out to make every wish of hers to come true, they are a match made in heaven, i'm not gonna gove away the ending but wow don't even read this, the author destroyed the happy ending, it was depressing, i couldn't believe it, the book was cut off a poorly written the only reason it got any stars was because the beginning kicked some major ace."
3,Slow begining- gets off course. Good book.,"The begining was a slow start, bored me a first, when Anna met the guy on the plane it started going off form there. The author spends to much time on other characters in the story, it also keeps you reading to hear what Anna is up to. It kept me on the edge of my seat through the middle to the end."
1,horrible,"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. There was no plot, no character development, and no point at all. Unlike the Gossip Girl books that are actually enjoyable to read, while reading this book I wanted to throw it out the window. It would talk about characters, then just forget them, definitly not worth your time."
3,yeah...,"haven't we already heard this before??? how much can we take of rich, bitchy girls?? anyway, i thought this book was sort of ok, and i had fun reading it. it was a perfect beach read and i read it in like two days. the story was sort of meaningless and stupid but i liked how they talked about LA and celebrities and stuff."
5,An Ye Harm None: Magical Morality And Modern Ethics,This book gave me alot more information than what I was hoping for. It goes into everything from children and how to raise them to involvement in your community. If you are looking for a book to learn more on ethics and morals ths is the one to check out!
1,so disappointed,"This sounded like just what I wanted. I don't know if the one I got was counterfeit or spoilt, but it smelled of nothing but stale alcohol. I couldn't believe it. I sprayed some on, waited awhile for it to settle, then asked my brother and sister-in-law to smell. The response? ""I don't smell anything but alcohol"".I tried it several times hoping something would emerge, but no such luck. I had to throw it away since you can't return perfume on Amazon. :(You really should test perfumes before buying. The one star is for the lovely bottle and packaging. The contents? Zero stars."
3,"Nice fragance, but...","The fragrance is very pleasant, but it doesn't last. This is such a pitty because Spanish scents are so clean and fresh."
5,Loving The Workouts,"I am really loving using these DVDs. There is so much to do to help focuse on your abs and then also has more to help with Ab combinations in the workouts and some nice general workouts to help you get a good overall workout.If you just want abs, use the first one, if you want just abs and add some things, use the second which has pure ab workout and also adds other things and the third adds cardio. Between the three, everything you want is here."
5,Classic,"Many narrowminded people will put this down ,Seriously read the lyrics and the sound is mastered. This was the last Dk release and controversial.get it punk."
5,Changed my life.,"This album proved to me that it's OK to be off-center and unclassifiable. Even the punk scene wasn't totally sure what to make of Nomeansno. These Canadians seemed too brainy, too frenetic, too able to play their instruments and spin off-kilter narratives while pogo-ing around the scene with endless energy to fit exactly into any scene. Their take on human nature was dark, to be sure, but there were big, fat tongues in cheek while they let their edgy, heavy, and dare I say funktastic satire cascade over the music scene.This album - well, fusion of two EP's - still carries the intensity of their live shows while staying musically complex. It set me on a path of challenging music for the rest of my life. Utterly essential, incredibly influential, hopelessly classic."
4,Lucas Davenport in New York?,"In this installment of the Prey series, Lucas Davenport finds himself in New York City chasing his old foe Michael Bekker. Having had his fill of Minnesotans, Bekker is now killing New Yorkers, and Davenport has been enlisted by his friend Lily Rothenburg to help find the monster.Of course that is not the only story unfolding within this book. Plot twists and subplots abound, as is Sandford's way.How can Bekker remain at large for so long with everyone looking for him? The answer to that question sends the reader spiraling toward an ending that resolves everything beautifully."
5,My wife has been using it during almost two years,My wife has been using it during almost two years and she is pretty well satisfied with it.
1,I can't believe Ann Rule wrote this!,"I am a fervent fan of Ms. Rule, and eagerly buy her books as soon as they come out. I find her writing clean, engaging and difficult to put down. All the things I admire about her writing is missing in this book. The story is very slow moving, she does not make the characters seem like real people, the descriptions are repetitive, and there are even grammatical errors. If you want to read an Ann Rule book, read one of her older ones. This one is a pale shadow of Ms. Rule's gift."
5,landmark film,"This is a landmark in sports documentary films. It is over-long for today's taste (115 mins) - one tires of watching the heats of the decathlon - but this is balanced by many superb moments.Unfortunately the version available here omits many of the classic sequences mentioned in reviews and monographs. The arrival of the Olympic torch in Berlin and its stunning entrance into the stadium is nowhere to be seen. Neither is the footage of the Hindenburg airship passing over the stadium during the opening ceremony.It seems to me that the source film print used for this video has been tampered with, and many of the key sequences removed, perhaps by a selfish individual for personal use at some point during the history of the print. These sequences certainly wouldn't have been removed by a competent editor familiar with the full original version."
3,I'm not convinced,"I love Gillian Welch's first two albums and had extremely high expectations on her new work. It's not bad, but very different. The lyrics are surreal, even Dylan-esque and the music sounds more modern, despite the spare acustic setting. Some of the songs are very beautiful but they don't speak to me as clearly as her previous songs."
2,I wish I liked it more,Saw her at the Garrison Keller show recently in Tucson AZ. I liked her music but this CD was very much a downer. Too slow for me and way too ballady. She has a great voice and has a lot of talent. But she needs to be in a real band with some drums and some electric guitars. This CD was very dull. Sorry.
5,A Classic Americana Album,"If longevity is a measure of an album's appeal, then the fact that this is still one of my favorites, SEVEN years after I purchased it surely says something. ""Time"" is a beautiful, poetic, and soothing album. ""I Want To Sing That Rock & Roll,"" is perhaps the happiest of the bunch...the rest have mournful (but not depressing) lyrics and sound. If you like Alison Krauss or Emmy Lou Harris, Gillian Welch is a sure-fire hit."
5,One of the greatest recordings I have ever heard.,"In a lifetime of listening to music, in the wake of thousands and thousands of albums sat with, there are perhaps 50 that are so self-assured, so complete, and so beautifully executed that there is nothing to say other than... ""don't let another day pass without listening to this."" Finding records like this is the whole reason I listen to music in the first place.Sunset on a decrepit back porch with a glass of whiskey..."
1,It's a Doggy.,"I was hoping to hear something like Alison Krauss or the Whites or something bluegrassy or folkish like John Prine. This is in a category all by itself. Nowhere.I played it once about a year ago when I bought it and then again last night and I still don't like it. I can't even tap my foot to it. It's just too darn S L O W. I did not know a person could write a slong as slow as these things are. And her voice is just boring. Excuse me, but you can keep your Gillian Welsh."
2,Trite Eurotrash,"I love foreign films and artsy flicks, but this one was simply trite Eurotrash. Messages and morals were forced down your throat at every opportunity. The film pits several foreign-exchange students all in a small apartment, and we're to believe that the only culture clash comes only briefly, and only from the brother of one of the students? What a joke. I would only recommend this film to Americans who believe the unity propoganda perpetrated by Europe. At the end of the film I was disgusted by the main character's actions and his cheezy reflection on all he's ""learned."" Save your money and buy something more meaningful and realistic."
4,Love this,"Loved this movie. Not sure why Audrey Tatou is on the cover when she has a minor role in this movie. This is a great coming of age story about a young man from France, who goes to Spain and experiences life. It happens to be one of my favorite French movies to date. There are many languages spoken in this movie but the main character speaks mainly French. Its a wonderful film I recommend to everyone over 17. Plus it has great music and great comedic moments."
4,Auber-genius,"Despite the sinister European Union funding of this film (there is no doubt that it promotes an unrealistically rosy view of European integration), it is an extremely enjoyable viewing experience.The acting is good, lines are witty, and the dialogue is equally amusing in English, Spanish or French.I recommend a purchase!"
5,Cabins of my dreams!!,"I love this book. It has such beautiful pictures and very detailed descriptions and bits of information. I just can't stop going thru the pages. I have looked at each cabin several times. I would definitely advise anyone that wanted to see some fantastic, unique cabins and get great ideas for one of your own, to get this book. It is well worth it!!"
4,Works,This is a good basic lap top case. Can't say anything negative about it. I would recommend it for sure.
4,"Great movie, poor DVD","I totally agree with some of the reviewers. This movie is great story-wise and acting-wise, but as a DVD, it is poor.First of all, WHY ARE THERE STILL FULL SCREEN DVDs?Is it for those TV morons?When you go to the theater, you see it in WIDESCREEN!!!Why not put BOTH versions on a DVD so everybody will be pleased.I bought 'Roxanne' and 'Taking Care Of Business' together.Roxanne offers full & widescreen formats for the same price.I know that this is a 'budget' DVD, but I think that DISNEY is rather cheap on this one. No extra or choice of language whatsoever.Like I said, Great movie but very disappointing DVD, even though it's still much better than VHS."
3,"pretty good movie, dam shame I had to watch it like this","Full screened of course, you are missign out on like 30% of the picture. But I will comment full that in a minute.The movie is absolutely wonderful. It is your typical sword drama with PLENTY of fighting at teh end to satisfy any genre fan. The movie starts out with a man going home returninig from the war. It is your typical killer clans, superhuman feats beign done type of movie. But it does so many new things. There is a MONSTER of a man in this, their are a ton of great henchmen. And not the best story but still very enjoyable. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for anyone willign to put up with one of the worst pan and scan jobs ever.But even if you don't enjoythe story, in the last 30 minutes you have a TON of great battles among various people(including the giant) that leads to a pretty good final fight."
1,I Hate This Thing - Do NOT Buy It,"I received this and the matching spatula as a present. I care about people who take the time to give me culinary gifts (inas much as they know that I have professional training), so I gave this stupid thing a good, long trial in my home kitchen, and I hate it.On one hand it is flexible silicone, so you can stick into a blazing hot pan and not worry about it. On the other, it is stiff, like some of my favorite melamine cooking stirrers/mixing things.This goofy thing combines the disadvantages of both tools: it is flexible, but only for about a 1/4 inch at the tip, since the core is solid metal. It is not a versatile soft scraper thing, since it has a solid core; nor is it a stiff, solid pot stirring thing since the edges are soft, rubber like stuff.I do not get it, hate it, and advise you not to waste your money to buy this thing."
4,"It's the music, stupid","Reading some of the reviews to this album, you would think that the producer did something to personally offend some DMB fans. People need to stop being backseat drivers and just listen to the music. These tracks will be great live, which is what a band like this is all about. It usually takes me about a month to figure out where an album belongs on my personal list of favorites, but I'm already warming up to this album, which is a very good sign. Reviewers seem to be worried about where the band is 'going' with their music. Enjoy the view from the backseat and let the band worry about driving the car. They've consistently taken us where the scenery is fine."
2,More Caffeine Please,"Sadly, I must agree with the other negative reviews. My beloved band has hit bottom with this collection of sluggish, uninspired tunes. It sounds like the DMB boys have switched to decaf - the songs are all a slow, meandering tempo combined with lackluster vocals. The title song is frighteningly bad, the vocals could be better done by a bunch of drunks. American Baby, the single, would be fine if not surrounded by the other plodding tunes. I love DMB, and could never give them less than two stars, but if you're not a die-hard fan, buy any and all of their other discs, but not this one."
5,everyone grows... and changes,"being a major fan from 2 things and on, this is new warm and inviting you that think this is simple and lost find your way.... LISTEN. dave rules always has always will."
2,Die Hard Dave Fan Dissatisfied,"Dave, what are you doing to me? Let's go back to the classic form that we all know and love (Crash, Ants Marching, Too Much) and do away with your lastest CD, Stand Up. THere are a few decent songs on this album (American Baby, Smooth Rider), but even those either lack true definition, or are too short to truly get in to. For some reason, the band has deemed it necessary to do away with a nice rythmic driving backbeat and lean toward a softer core of chants and other mediocre vocals.Finally, Dave and Co., KEEP YOUR POLITICAL VIEWS OUT OF MY MUSIC."
2,"Weak Effort, I hate writing this paragraph below...","In this Album it seems as though Dave did not really give too much thought or effort into the album and it clearly shows. He may have been attempting to do something he has never done before, but either way, it is uncomfortable, poorly done, and overly produced, in my opinion. I refuse to listen to Everyday, so keep that in mind, as I consider it better than Everyday, but not far from. Every other Album from DMB showcases the musical talents of the band and takes music in new directions, while this album is not even close to the expectations or talents DMB has established for itself over the years. Also, I guess you could ask if my musical tastes are changing as well...who knows..."
2,What Happened Here?,"I am devout fan of Dave Matthews Band, I have every album except of a few of their live albums. After reading the Rolling Stones review and buying the album I totally agree that the conventional sound of DMB is gone on this album, the sax especially. I was expecting a lot more from this new album, I waited and waited for it and it fell right on its face. I hope for the better for this band that they listen to what the fans want and go back to what they are known for. Oh yea watch for the copy protection on the disk."
1,Dave - Stand Up to RCA,"I popped the CD into my car on the way home from the music store. I was very pleasantly surprised with the sound and content of the music.Once I got home and put the CD in my computer to add it to my database and IPOD, I became concerned. Apparently RCA was installing something on my PC (as had happened with a recently purchased Sony Shel Silverstein CD).Now I've discovered that I am facing hours worth of tweaking my computer in order to remove an insidious program that's opened a security hole on my PC. Now, I'm ANGRY.Shel, unfortunatley is not with us anymore; but, Dave (and other artists that proport to care about rights) need to take a stand for fair use.Music: 5 StarsIntegrity: 0 Stars"
1,Take It Back,"I'm one of those people who listen to music on my laptop. Guess what, Stand Up has a DRM scheme that loads a program which you must accept or it will not play. Well I don't allow spyware on my computer. If I was using iTunes or MS to download a song I would expect this but I don't on a CD that I buy. I'm taking this worthless plastic disc back. The DMB can crash into me."
1,Mediocre Music + Copyrighted CD = Don't Bother,"I was a huge fan of DMB in the early and mid nineties and still love their live shows...but their recent recorded work doesn't capture what used to be so good about them (and what still can be good in concert). Basically, Stand Up seems a bit drab and a bit un-noteworthy. Nothing really stands out in a positive way (with the exception of the first two songs, Dreamgirl and Old Dirt Hill). The choruses are annoyingly repetitive (like in Stand Up), etc...just bad.On top of the mediocre music, they added copyright protection and a host of annoying materials to the CD. There is nothing worse than spending $15 on a cd, putting it in the drive, and having your computer freeze up from some lame-@ss flash demo...and then not being able to rip it. I hate that."
1,Waste of Time,"I want my money back - this new CD is not DMB. I listened through twice and took it back and got my money back. Now, I want to be compensated for the wasted time in listening to it.The riffs are weak guys. The melodies are lost. Too much crap in the background. Seems like they lost something after Lillywhite. Where did it go?"
2,Evolution?!,"The interesting thing about all these reviews on Amazon is that they're either people who 1)are fans of Dave Matthews Band's early stuff, or 2)people who justify the current album as part of the evolution process. First of all, why do groups have to evolve? The Rolling Stones have been doing the same thing for 40+ years, and no one seems to be complaining. The real weakness behind this album is not the production, or evolution of the band, but the strength of the songs. This was becoming obvious on ""Everyday,"" and continues here. There are just no songs that instantly capture your attention here. An acquired taste? Perhaps. But this band was always known for its catchy tunes, and innovative instrumentation. The earlier albums had this. So did ""Busted Stuff."" Thank goodness Dave puts on one of the best live shows in the business, or else there'd be a lot of angry Daveheads."
2,overproduced,"First off, I think this record could have been better with a more hands off approach from the producer. Too many studio tricks,and too much non musical gadgetry going on. Why on earth on some of these tracks would you have a synth drum beat instead of Buford playing straight up in all these songs. In my opinion he is the strongest part of the band. Why on earth would you want to dilute his playing. Also, the songs seem just thrown together. Lets face it. Everyone knows the strongest part of this band is the jam. Just let them open up and go for it. This disk is short on improvisation and catchy hooks. No one was expecting another Crash. Busted stuff was a step in the right direction. Stand Up, sorry to say, is not. Drop the producer."
3,Decent album but lacks inspiration.,"I dont like rap because by the end of the song I feel like I have listened to it 3 times over. This is sort of how I feel about this album and blame rap producer Mark Babson for this. The album has a nice smooth feel to it but lacks true character. If this was their first album they would quickly fade into nobody's, no long tangents like seen in Before These Crowded Streets. I agree they should have discarded Hello Again and kept Sugar Will. Louisiana has great potential but once again the repetition kills it. I think they should have spent another more time in the studio making a more complex album and released the CD next month. I like it but it is not up to their potential. Buy if you are a fan, the casual listener will not appreciate this album."
2,Music is a 3.5 the disk is a 1,Do yourself a favor and pirate this album. If you don't you will have to go through countless unecessary steps to get this on your iPod.I never thought I would pirate a Dave Matthews album until this one. Who would have that that DRM would CAUSE piracy?The music is sub-par for Dave Matthews as well. Unless you like the pop crap that is everywhere.
1,Sunncomm?,"Apparently one can bypass this excellent media protection software by holding down shift prior to installing the cd. Of course, sunncomm threatened to sue when the subterfuge of this software end-around was made public. I suppose they must protect the millions that go into the development of such sophisticated software. By the way thanks Dave--first the Chicago dump and this (a dump of another kind)."
1,Try a new band instead,"Dave has lost his passion and his writing shows it time and time again. I suggest you try a new band's CD, perhaps one without SpyWare. I buy ALL of my music legit, but I do make copies for MY use. Between autos and home I have five CD players. (Eight if you count computers) Does Sony (or the DMB) really expect me to buy 5 copies of the same CD? I hereby swear my allegiance whatever group that opposes this type of copy protection."
3,Different Direction,"Like many other reviewers here, I own pretty much all the DMB albums. I like the sound these guys make. Look at this way; they have been playing together for many years, they have sold over 20 million albums. They are talented musicians, so why would they want to trot out another ""Under The Table & Dreaming"" or ""Crash""? How satisfying artistically would that be? Not very I imagine. It's not like they need any more cash. They are keeping their music fresh and different because that is what makes playing music interesting for musicians. Guys of this calibre would want a new approach, a new groove, a new style. I would imagine that if DMB trotted out 5-6 ""Crash"" albums, people would moan that they all sound the same, or that they're boring. I bet that would be satisfying for the band members, writing, playing and recording the same formula for 10 years. Yeah!"
2,Dave Matthews on cruise control,"DMB is basically on cruise control the entire album. I still remain disappointed after many listens. As far as I'm concerned DMB's best album is and will be the shelved and then leaked - Lillywhite Sessions; which became what we now know as 'Busted Stuff'. However, when the tracks were officially released it became apparent that they were ruined by 'tampering and over production'. On 'Stand Up the band has turned on cruise control, and have produced a creative dud. I really wanted to love this album. Dave, I suggest you look through your roledex and give Steve Lillywhite a call next time around."
2,Mediocre,"WTF?Dark,dreary and artificial sounding.The drum mix bites,and the unnecessary use of drum machines/sequencers add an aspartame/corn sweetener taste to this album.Sounds muddled and confusing in terms of production.Dave,get another producer and engineer,cause the ones you have are deaf,dumb and blind.Not a big fan of this one."
2,SUPRISINGLY- new is not better,"Graciously awaiting a new album with high expectations is something I live for. I never thought that I would be so dissapointed with a DMB album as I am with this one. It rates nowhere near any other past release. With the release of ""American Baby"" I thought that the album would be unbelievably awesome but they went the wrong way. Boyd is nowhere to be found but for a few tracks, Leroi is also on select tracks and Carter is still his awesome self but there is that electric drum beat feel which doesn't feel good. There is more piano than ever before which sounds ok. I hate writing this bad review but the songs were just boring and lacking FUN. They sound like a country gospel band. I have given this album a chance but it doesn't work. I'M ANGRY!"
1,major disappointment,"this album is like dave matthews, carter beauford and stefan lesard with special appearances by boyd tinsley and leroi moore...there's no need for the violin and sax in this music, you mostly just hear the crappy producer on the keys...i don't expect DMB to stay exactly the same forever, but this is just bad news...i could barely bring myself to listen to the whole thing"
3,"OK, but ultimately forgettable","I'm not sure how disappointed I am in this album. It's not bad. It's just that I've listened to it four times now and I can't remember a single song on it well enough to hum it. With DMB's old stuff, I couldn't get it out of my head--and didn't want to! This album is stocked with easy listening, happy, fluffy songs. It says, ""Go ahead. Drink the water."" There's no passion; no poetry. Previous albums had the band doing things with instruments that blew you away. This album . . . anybody could have played it. The music isn't bad, but it isn't exceptionally good. Not hot, not cold. It's one of those albums you don't regret buying, but--after a month--forget that you bought. Ho-hum. I can only hope that it grows on me in time."
1,a load of....,"This is the biggest load of crap from DMB since his tour bus opened up its septic tank on the bridge in Chicago, showering the boat passengers underneath with stuff that smelled like this music sounds. Avoid as you would New Orlenas flood water, toxic stuff!!"
2,The new Dave Matthews Band,"I think we can all agree that this album is very much not like the DAve Matthews Band of the old days. I would argue that if some random badn put this album out and all you DMB fans heard it, you wouldn't like it. It's because it's DMB you are blinded, and you can't see past the fact that it's DMB and it actually is a bad album. This album is not Dave Matthews Band you find on Under the Table and Dreaming, Crash, Before These Crowded Streets and Busted Stuff. If you like those albums quite a bit and dismiss Everyday as a non-DMB album as well, you won't like this. It's junk, overly produced and I hate it. Don't buy it."
4,Dual Disc--Be Careful,"I bought the dual disc this morning, but when I got it home, it wouldn't play on my computer or in the cd player. There's a small print warning on the back of the CD they pointed out to me in the store when I returned it that says the audio side of the CD will not play on all CD players.So, be careful buying the dual-disc--I had to exchange it for the one-sided CD.Otherwise, it's a great album."
2,Not the Dave I Grew To Love,"This is not the Dave that the true fans know and love. The band has lost its way. Having 24 CDs means nothing...I started listening to this band from the creation and was in owe with its creativity and step away from the norm. They have sense been taken in by the commercial world of crappy pop/new age rock. And this pains me to make a comment like this about DMB. But, given the last three albums (not including Some Devil) I would say it is over with this band."
3,This album is sexy,The year is not 1994. Who wants to hear the same stuff from the same old band? Let Dave and the band create. Let them experiment. They have already proven themselves as great musicians. So shut up and sit back and listen to one of the sexiest collection of songs to be assembled by Dave and the gang.
3,Where has the Dave Matthews Band gone?,"This album, will not become a classic, it lacks key elements that made DMB what they were. This album is a bit slower and laid back, less passion than the first few albums. They are better off recording some non-studio tracks from back in the day and releasing them as a new album. like ""Granny"" for example. The sound mixing on this album is good for 2 channel audio; everything is clear and crisp. However, I specifically bought this thinking it would be in 5.1 multichannel audio. I was wrong, its not. Its an extreme dissapointment to me, But I soppose if DMB will ever release a 5.1 audio album, Id much rather it be a re-mastered version of one of their first 3 classic albums, and not this new stuff. I miss the old Dave Matthews Band."
2,Lyrically lacking,"Maybe it's a coincidence that printed lyrics don't come with the artwork on ""Stand Up"", but maybe it's because there's not much depth to plumb here. Lyrically, this is Dave Matthews' weakest offering to date. The songs ""Stand Up"", ""Wake Up"", ""Hello Again"" and ""Louisiana Bayou"" all have a very fast, repetitive chorus which is sung over and over, ad nauseum. What makes it worse is that the repetition doesn't allow for any of the musicians to veer from the track and experiment with the melody. There are a few really enjoyable, melodic laidback tunes on the album, but again, they don't have the lyrical heft of ""Don't Drink the Water"" or ""Proudest Monkey"" or ""Ants Marching"". Fortunately, the band's website offered this album as a package deal with three previously unreleased live albums, so I am at least enjoying those. Check out the website for their latest live albums, and don't be surprised if ""Stand Up"" leaves you underwhelmed."
1,Disappointing for the last time.,I give up on DM. He sounds like he has Emphysema on this album along with the lack of melody and instumental talent that had made his '90s albums great. His bands talent went with the sewage that he dumped on those poor people on the tour boat in Chicago.
3,What happened to the the old DMB??,"I am a DMB fan, I have purchased all of their albums, but I have been deeply disappointed by the past couple of releases. The band hardly ever used synthesizers and computers on their old stuff, and now, that is all this album consists of. Don't get me wrong, I still like the songs, they are not bad songs, but I am a lover of ""Under the Table..."" and ""Crash"", the music that would lift you up during the day. The music that you didn't want to take out of your cd player. The bands newer stuff has been a bit lackluster. My advice, get the cd if you have liked the previous two DMB releases, you will not be disappointed, but if you have not been to keen on the previous two, you can skip this one without missing a whole lot. By the by... If anyone who knows the band happens to read this, tell them to go back to the days of ""Crash"", that was DMB at their best."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"HUGE dissapointment. I'm not usually one to give extremely bad reviews, but this one deserves it. You cannot rip this CD without installing some mysterious software on your computer which seriously limits what you can do, and quite possibly has spyware. In the future I will be VERY weary of recent RCA albums, as this is something they have been getting into lately.Musically, it is a substantial departure from their traditional style (and I do like their previous albums); it's pretty boring to me."
3,From a dinosaur fan:,"I have always been a big dinosaur lover, and in this book, Silverberg, Dobson, and Zimmerman really bring these creatures to life. I loved every page. This is a book for both kids and the paleontologist."
1,similar product,I bought the Care Bear's version of this sprinkler as a gift for my niece and it is pretty much the same. The hose won't attach properly and basically broke before she even had a chance to use it. Target needs to pay a little more attention to it's quality of products.
5,A great spider movie,"This was a great movie. Everything about the movie was great. Very good acting throughout the movie. It's about these killer spiders who invade a small town killing almost everyone in it. As always, the ending was the best. The ending was filled with suspence. Even people who hate spiders should see this movie. I am not a spider lover but still loved this movie. Jeff Daniels is wonderful in this movie. Buy this movie, it is great for the whole family."
4,Real Eight-Legged Freaks,"Forget that David Arquette movie, ""Arachnophobia"" will make you laugh and get an upset stomach. A mysterious species of spiders have made their way from Venezuela to a Northern California town. Unfortunately for the new doctor (Jeff Daniels), his patients were becoming ill and dying. Bad bugs. Again, he could've used Black Flag instead of hiding in the corner. At least somebody exterminated the spiders (John Goodman as the Exterminator Dude) and called it a day. Spiders were everywhere: the barn, the house, and even in the shower! Those are some sneaky, slimy bugs. If I see a spider, I'll squish it with my bare hand. No problem. Man, these people and their phobias... mortals. Frank Marshall's movie is funny and entertaining."
3,"Good Family Movie, but...","If you are looking for a good family movie that will keep on the edge of your seat, this one would be a good choice. BUT, if you are a fan of special effects and you want to take full advantage of your Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound System, this is NOT a movie for you. (Especially if you own the Matrix, or Terminator 2...) You could watch this in 3 Channel Stereo, which is essentially what I did. The plot drags a bit at the beginning...overall, not bad. The video is pretty good...You'd probably be better off watching this in VHS and save your money."
3,"Good Film , but where's the Spider?","I laugh every time I see the cover art for this movie. I own the original movie poster for the film , which is almost identical to the one pictured here EXCEPT! There is supposed to be a Spider dangling from the top and hanging in front of the moon. Why they removed the spider in a film called Arachnophobia has puzzled me for years. It is a decent campy scare film regardless."
3,Its OK but its kinda lame,I do like parts of this movie and im happy I own it anyway BUT an that's a big BUT this isn't much of a spider movie.This is a movie i would let and 8 year old watch.I would recomend this as a great movie to introduce horror movies to kids.Its not scary in the least hell they could show this movie un edited on TV its like a family freindly creature feature.So while I do like it there are plenty of better spider movies out there (...)
1,He should have quit while he was ahead,"After enjoying the eventful and emotional journey from Texas to Montana and back, who could imagine that the very same author would pen such a banal work. McMurtry deliberately selected a proper starting point for Lonsome Dove. Pushing the line back even further was a mistake. He created a torturous journey for Woodrow and Gus, and for this reader as well."
3,too violent,"I liked the sequel to this book, Lonesome Dove, and I know that this book was about the wild west, but the characters went straight from one violent situation to another."
3,Good Story Despite the Writing,"I am not a big McMurtry fan because of his writing. He switches POV all the time and I have yet to read one of his books that couldn't have benefited cut about 20,000 words or more.Even with that Dead Man's Walk is a pretty solid read. It's episodic, like the other Gus and Woodrow novels I've read, full of violence and humor and pathos....these are his trademark and he does it pretty well, right down to the surrealistic ending. This is the book that purports to be the first in the series, even though it was written after Lonesome Dove. That's okay, the book is still fun (for the most part) and if you like the characters from the previous novels you will definitely like them here, too, as they begin their work for the Texas Rangers.Not the best and not the worst I've read from McMurtry, but still memorable...and in a good way. Check it out."
4,Interesting Prequel,"For me, Lonesome Dove is not my favorite of McMurtry's work. It is an excellent book, and I would rate it 5 stars, but I've always enjoyed The Last Picture Show series the most. That being said, Dead Man's Walk is an enjoyable read. It's not Lonesome Dove, but then, who would want to read the exact same story? For me, I like the variety. This story introduces us to some great characters. Gus and Call are fun, as always. People who wanted the story to be another Lonesome Dove -- for the author to be true to the characters -- another Lonesome Dove is not what has been written. They are young men in this story, and it give us an inkling of what helped shape them into the characters we read about later. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially fans of the Lonesome Dove series. It's definitely worth the money..."
3,Why does he use real-life characters ?,"Why doesn't the author use fictional characters only? In 1841, our heroes meet Charles Goodnight who was born in 1836 - making him 5 years old when the story takes place. The black man with him would be Bose Ikard who was not born until 1847 ! Lady Carey apparently had her portrait painted by Gainsborough - who died in 1788. She must be at least 60 years old - with a 10 year old son ? 'Bigfoot' Wallace actually survived the 'Black Beans' lottery and lived until 1899 ! If Mr McMurtry insists on using real people as characters he should at least do some research."
2,Too Much,"If all of the miserable experiences of DEAD MAN'S WALK are to be believed, then young Gus and Call missed their calling. If indeed these two nineteen-year-old greenhorn Rangers survived the never-ending onslaught of bloodthirsty Indians and the harsh environment of the Old West--while seasoned and battle-tested men all around them drop like flies--then they should have abruptly left law enforcement and become priests.Total suspension of credibility is the theme of this book, culminating in the improbable, laugh-out-loud climactic scene, when an English lady suffering from leprosy strips naked and wraps a boa constrictor around her shoulders and rides a white horse through a band of savage Comanches. (See what I mean?)McMurtry is a master storyteller, and LONESOME DOVE is as good as it gets, but this prequel misses the mark by a country mile."
5,"Fear of a Punk Planet, Vol. 1","I haven't watched the DVD or have seen its condition however, my boyfriend has and, as he is extremely critical of almost everything, him saying it was great should say enough."
3,"No, Ma Ya is better.","I respectfully disagree with the other two reviewers of this cd: Ma Ya is better (great) IMO. This cd actually sounds more western to me, and the songs seem a bit less full. Habib's voice and playing is less powerful, and the songs sound a bit nervous and tinnier. There are some great rhythmic exchanges between the bass and drums, but I feel the whole band, and especially the other three players, really blossom on the second cd, where the songs are richer, better recorded, and more emotional."
4,Dead Kennedys - A Great Introduction!,"This was my first Dead Kennedys record and a I thought it was fantastic. The first half of the album is a bit stronger than the second half, but overall it was a great introduction to a band that I had heard much about, but little music from. I will definitely check out more of their catalog."
5,DKs finest,"DK is without a doubt one of the most prominent names in punk history. This CD sums up all there great work from a long time ago. This CD makes it easier to enjoy DK and not have to dig up all there rare records. By far the best DK album, buy today"
5,Essential,"Good release and all the songs are good,I recommend this withBed time for democracy,Fresh fruit..., Plastic surgery disasters,Get them all."
3,Longitudinal Study,"This book is a description of the longitudinal study conducted in England by Elliott Jaques of an actual factory in operation and various methods used to affect production and employee relations. It is valuable from an historical and scientific perspective and the study formed, in part, the basis for Jaques theories of management, organizational structure, and executive levels. It was followed by numerous works, especially: ""Requisite Organization,"" ""Executive Leadership,"" and ""Human Capability."""
2,Maybe okay for the guitar...,"This book was recommended by Amazon as a third accompanying Bluegrass Fakebook and The Real Bluegrass Book. I checked the description, but maybe not the buyers' comments well enough--I was surprised to find only guitar tabs. I'm a mandolin student. Need I say more? :-/"
5,this movie is amazing,"so...I don't know about the dvd. I have only ever seen this as a movie on the big screen (thank you rep houses and indie cinemas!). but, if you like cassavettes films, opening night is one of his best. gena rowlands gives a mind-blowing performance as a woman dealing with and running from her fears and responsibilities. it's a gorgeous and heavy movie about how staggering it can be to come to terms with who you are and where you are in your life, vs. where you think you should be. of course, as it's a cassavettes film, it's also a lot about what you bring to it as well.it won't please everyone(see one-star review) but it impresses the hell out of me every time I see it."
4,Behind-the-scenes info for Cass buffs,"For a fascinating behind-the-scenes info about Opening Night and a list of books about Cassavetes' work, go to Ray Carney's website dedicated to John Cassavetes (found through any search engine)."
5,an old tale in beautifull new pictures,"We all know the story of Cinderella, however, there were two things about this version that sets it apart from the many others of this oft-told tale.First, the illustrations are exquisite oil paintings which bring a new magic to the story.The second thing that makes a difference is the relationship between Cinderella & her father. In most other versions, the father loves her to pieces, & then dies. Thus he is unable to save Cinderella from her nasty step-mother. In this telling, the father does not die, he keeps his mouth shut about the way his daughter is treated, for fear of his new wife's anger. I thought it was an interesting twist.To sum it up, this is one of the better & more realistic Cinderella stories"
4,Excellent flight instruction book,"Tom Knauff is acknowledged as leading instructor and has written a very good book. It leads you through an entire flight training plan to solo with an emphasis on safety and decision making. However, it is meant to be used in conjuction with your actual flight training so be sure to discuss using this book with your flight instructor. There is an updated (1995?) edition."
2,Not a book to waste your money on,"I find it hard to believe that any of these ""strategies"" would work. Hang up signs, assume mortgages, options... don't waste your time. I have read many books and this is probably the worst. It may offer some motivation, but the majority of these ideas are worthless!"
2,"Details career, lacking info on personal life.","You can find out a lot about Chuck Connors career in this book, but little about his personal life. I was really hoping for an in-depth biography, but only found an in-depth filmography. The title of David Fury's book is misleading. It should read ""Chuck Connors;The Career Behind the Man Behind the Rifle"". This would be a good textbook for movie buffs. Disappointing."
4,chuck connors a good bio,This was a good book.It gave lots of information about his life. It also gave good details like the teams he played on.How tall he was.It also gave lots of pic and where and when he was born and grow up and where he died.It is clear that he spent a long life and that the authour spent a long time researching
4,"Great photos, lots of details, excellent quotes","David Fury obviously put a lot of work into this book. I believe almost everyone interested in Chuck Connors would be glad to own a copy. There are dozens of excellent photos, details about all his movies and television shows, and quotes about Connors from many of the performers who worked with him. It's a quality hardcover book, well worth the cover price. I also recommend that those interested in Connors check out the chapter on him in Baseball's Forgotten Heroes."
3,Disappointed; not what I expected.,"I am an occupational therapist in the schools and had hoped for practical information that I could share with teachers and parents, or use myself in the classroom. The book seemed geared toward teachers; I liked that there were descriptions of why each activity was beneficial for kids. I feel like I get the same thing from Brain Gym, though. (This does offer some other suggestions, however.) I would have liked to see more than just isolated exercises...more of a program or routine (how can we make this fun for kids, especially those who have motor planning problems or other ""out-of-step"" problems). As an OT I could have come up with most of these exercises myself, but teachers may find it useful and I may end up using it as a resource for them."
1,Be Careful,"Only rarely does hollywood make a better movie than the original book -- as in this case. This audiobook is true to the original book, but probably not what most customers want."
1,Doesn't Last,Didn't last a year before it wouldn't light up. Replacing the $14 bulb didn't work. This is just poorly made and has no chance of ever lasting the 3 yr warranty. Walmart has even stopped selling this item because of so may returns.
1,Don't waste your time!,"I purchased (and returned) this from a local home improvement store. This bug zapper is JUNK! I read the varied reviews but figured I'd give it a try anyway. I liked the propaganda about attracting more bugs because of the true black light, and the light sensor. I had an older bug zapper, so I placed it about 25 feet from this new one. The old zapper worked good, as always. This zapper zapped once or twice when it first turned on, but then not much more. I don't know if it was because it didn't attract bugs, or if the high voltage wasn't working. It lit up every night for about 2 weeks, the after the first rain....KAPUT! If one good rain will zap the zapper, then I'd say it is a p!ss p@@r design. I don't know how this company is still in business."
1,didn't work,"i have a creek right behind my 1 1/2 acres and we have always had bug issues. i got the stinger at bjs, worked great the first day and thats it! it wouldn't come on the second day, i just returned it and i'm getting a flowtron instead...i'll see if that lives up to the glowing reviews."
1,looks spiffy; doesn't work,"...not on flies, anyway. The flies land everywhere on the outsides of it, on the cord suspending it, but don't want to fly between the wires at all.If your problem is flies, get some sticky tape and a fly swatter."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Within a month, the outer paint started shelling off leaving an ugly two tone look of black and brass like color. This was with minimal use and no abuse or exposure to say chemicals etc. it seems to be a defect. Don't waste your money!"
2,A little goes a long way,"This popcorn salt is incredibly strong. We have a smaller, amusement-park style kettle. A little bit makes the corn incredibly salty and bright orange. It's possible that this is extra potent for big theatre kettles. But use sparingly in a smaller kettle."
5,SHATTERED HOPES The True Story of the Amityville Murders.,Just Finished Shattered Hopes TRUE Amityville Murders Part 1.Got to say NO Stone is left Unturned. This is The MOST in depth Documentry on this Subject I have EVER seen. So much NEW STUFF never before exposed. Even if you are mildly interested in The Amityville Case this is THE ONLY Documentry worth watching as it is an in Depth Account of The Events. The only Downer for me is I've got to wait to see The other parts. This is a MUST SEE...
5,nice,"I have been using this saw for about 3 months now. I have found it a pleasure to use. The vibration is truly minimal, no numbness in hands after using. Nice straight, easy to guide cutting. Minimal splintering on cutedges using finer blades. I have never had the orbital control off the first 2 settings and these have been plenty for up to 1 inch hardwoods. On 2x4 pine it is also a joy to use. much easier to use than my old B&D. Actually I would say that in ease and smoothness there is no comparison. The blade change system is excellent. No tools required to change the blade, no screws getting gummed up with sap from the wood. A minor point, but the carrying case is also nicely laid-out. The dividers hold the saw securely when transported and the positioning inside makes the case well balanced when the tool is in it. I think this is one tool that you do get what you pay for."
3,Motor burned out after two years,"The saw was a pleasure to use. It was powerful, comfortable, easy to change blades, and accurate. The saw only lasted two years though and the motor has burned out. I don't use it every day and I keep it in the case in a closet, when not in use. For a saw that is called a pro saw it doesnt last long enough."
5,Well made and powerful jigsaw from the folks who know handtools,"The Bosch 1590EVSK is one powerful jigsaw. I have had mine for about a month now and I've put it to every test I can think of... metal pipe, sheet metal, laminated wood, thin wood, thick wood and concrete board. It scrolls, it cuts straight and it bevels with ease. It is really a fine tool. The only thing I can think of that is a detractor is the lack of accessories available... at least on Amazon. Most of the accessories that I would want are not listed for this model. I'll have to check with the manufacturer to see what gives."
5,The Best,"This is the best jigsaw ever made, period. Kip (is this a real name) please don't give a great product a bad review because of shipping. This is about the product not a third party shipment. It's people like you who ruin the value of these feedback forums."
2,Definitely NOT vintage Clive Cussler!,"A formulaic thriller that includes everything but the kitchen sink - unrepentant Nazis, Basque separatists, an outcast murderous tribe of Eskimos, Canadian natives in northern Quebec, environmental activists and the usual female sex interest. This one goes beyond the pale and actually seems comedic at best. The heroes can thank their lucky stars that the dastardly villains resort to that time-worn cliche of gloating instead of getting on with killing them when they've got the chance!This one's definitely a laffer! Give it a pass and save your pennies for the next one."
4,Still good - but losing its luster,"I've always enjoyed Cussler's books, and have always felt that they maintained their enjoyability - despite many people saying that Cussler had lost his luster. I now agree that there is some improvement needed in order to get his books back to what they were. Trojan Odyssey was just plain awful. This book is better, but was somewhat stale. The authors seemed to reach for plot points, and the characters seemed a little too stereotypical. Dirk Pitt was always great at getting out of a squeeze. It is just assumed that Austin will get out of a squeeze, leaving no tension whatsoever. Unlike Pitt, Austin's solutions are not inventive. It was Pitt's inventiveness that made a predictable result exciting. Despite being a relatively new character, Austin seems to have surpassed Pitt in his abilities. I would like to have seen his hero status take a little more time to develop.The book is still worth the read, but I have to wonder where this franchise is going."
3,Loved it,I would recommend it to anyone who likes adventure and fantasy. I love all of the Clive Cussler books so far
4,Bad fish,"Having been a commercial diver for 25 years, and my attraction toCussler's novels, this one was especially different. I really did likeit and is well worth reading."
4,need replacement battery?,This battery is working fine for the few months that I've had it. It fit my APC UPS 500 backup system and it cost a few bucks less than the APC version.
3,Right size for APC ES-650 but wrong terminals (small),"I bought this to replace the battery for my APC ES-650. The specs are right including the size of the battery but the terminals are smaller than my original. It works but a bit loose. If somebody moves the UPS, there is a chance of the battery getting unplugged which already happened. I would need to replace the terminals of the UPS to make a perfect fit."
1,Pathetic,"Sorriest product I have ever purchased. Didn't function at all. After spending most of Christmas day trying to get this thing to work, my son and I finally gave up. The instructions were both inconsistent with the existing hand controller configuration and incomplete (no instructions as to how much battery charging is required, nor are there any battery charging indicators). I would not recommend this product to anybody."
1,Tedious boring idiocy,"This film is a remake of the 1962 classic. But whereas the 1962 version was haunting and poetic, this remake is drab and boring.The story has been ""updated"" to include a child abuse theme, thus explaining why the lead character has trouble ""connecting"" with people. Also tossed in are special effects monsters taken from JACOB'S LADDER. None of this new stuff adds anything to the film.This film is also poorly edited. The character keeps waking up, discovering that what happened was a dream. Then waking up again. Now she's in the water, then she isn't, then she's crawling out of the water, then it didn't happen.If you've seen the original, you might be able to guess what's going on in this remake. If not, then you'll probably be even more confused."
1,BOOOORRRRIIIINNNNGGGG!!!!!!!!!,"What has happened to the once great Wes Craven? If he had any respect whatsoever left, he would have asked the studios to lose this one. As a favor to yourself, just put the video down and walk away. Act like you never saw it. confusing to the very end."
5,This pool is soooo cute!,"We love this little pool! I found mine at Ocean State Job Lot for $5.99! It took some effort to blow it up, but it can be done! It is so colorful. Nice and cushy for our 7 month old so if he topples over he does not wack his head on anything hard. He was obsessed with splashing once he got in it. We could not get his attention for a photo to save our lives! Great buy for the price!"
4,Cute little pool -- but too little for my active 9 month old ...,"I love this pool ... I thought it was adorable! After reading a few reviews I ran out and bought it (at Wal Mart - a bit less expensive). Well, my 9 month old son was occupied for the first day and then decided to spend day two by crawling out of it! So we had to buy a slightly larger one to keep him contained. But I still love this pool, I just wish he was interested!"
2,This pool may be great for under 9 months but is not so great for older toddlers,"I purchased this pool when my some was about 8 months old. He enjoyed it while it was inside our home, but when we took it outside to fill it he got bored in less than 5 minutes. It barely holds any water (and 1.5 inches) and theres barely any room for other children. I'd be lucky to get 2 1 year olds in it. It's probably great for young babies, but for parents of older, busy toddlers it's just not big enough. The price was great on it and its very durable but just not big enough!"
4,Rogue Valley history,"With this book, you can visit the deep canyons of the Rogue River as one of the West's last frontiers. The faded memories recalled by this tale of a good and simple people in a land of hardships will walk with you down a heritage trail, hand in hand with those early trailblazers who opened a wild country of beauty and abundance , the Rogue valley."
2,older version,"book arrived in a timely manner, although the book is a previous version, not the current version sold by A Beka. I should have paid more attention to the version / copyright date. It should work find for this fall."
1,A Terrible Study Guide,"I recently purchased the Police Officer Exam study guide as a way for me to practice my exam skills before doing the actual tests. While the information in the beginning is helpful the tests are very incorrect. For example, question number 93 in the very first exam asks how do you spell the word ""magnificent"". I selected ""b"" as this is the correct spelling. Much to my dismay I found out when I checked my answer that I was wrong, the word is actually spelled ""maggnifisent"". I just finished the second exam and so far I have found over 20 errors in the questions and in the answers so I will not be using this book anymore. DO NOT PURCHASE! Use Barron's Police Officer Exam study guide instead. A much better way to prep for officer examinations!Barron's Police Officer Exam (Barron's Police Officer Examination)"
5,A valuable tool,"This book provides an insightful and even-handed appraisal of Ronald Reagan and his presidency. The author, a journalist and former White House correspondent for The Washington Post, covered Reagan extensively during his tenure as governor of California, his campaigns for president, and his tenure in the Oval Office. The book describes how Reagan treated the presidency as an opportunity to perform and gave a magnificient performance as president of the United States. The book highlights Reagan's intelligence as an actor, his commitment to his craft, and his success at being presidential."
1,A weird bird,The author - not the subject. Just a very strange book that requires a real will to finish.
4,Great Inside Look at Reagan White House,"This book really focuses on Reagan and his relationships with those who were in his inner circle. Mr Cannon seemed to be very objective in his writing and it is obvious that he had close relationships with most of the key players. The amount of detail concerning major events, i.e. Iran Contra, Iceland Meeting, was really amazing although in the case of Iran Contra somewhat tedious. If you are a Reagan fan, you may find Cannon's portrait of a distant, detached president disturbing, as I did. I did enjoy this book very much and felt that I gained some insight to the players of this fascinating presidency."
2,Hard to operate for little ones,"We got this for our three year old and she isn't strong/coordinated enough to push the silver on switch, we have to do it for her. This has not been a problem with other flashlights, just this one."
5,This story IS cute!!,"Like all the Little Owl books, this story is VERY cute. It perfectly captures the mixed feelings young children have about always being called ""cute."" On top of that, the illustrations are big, bold, colorful, and adorable. It's easy to see why the other animals keep calling Little Owl cute! The language is simple, and the story is repetitive and easy for young children to follow along. (I add a little song when Little Owl says ""I'm not cute!"" - it goes, ""I'm not cute! I'm not cute! Please don't call me cute!"" Children like to sing along in a small ""Little Owl"" voice.)I think the cutest part of the whole book is the tiny stuffed owl that Little Owl cuddles up with at bedtime!The young children I teach, ages eighteen months - six years old, all love this story."
4,Unstopable Cell,In the video the Z warriors are aready tired out. Cell has become so strong that no one can take him. He is almost perfect Cell. This is last video for the Imperfect Cell Saga. I say it rocks.
4,Cool Pool Toy,"I like Intex products. I've had many over the years and they usually are good quality. They're pretty durable and if they do get a puncture, patches usually work. This sea turtle is the perfect size for kids. Plus it's wide enough that it tends to flip over a lot less than a lot of the other ride on toys."
4,great purchase,Love this item. The adults like it for sunbathing and kids love to play with it. Large enough for three of my young granddaughters to play on. We are very pleased.
4,Good value,"This pool toy is a lot of fun. It would be good to have some sort of air pump. Blowing up by mouth can be a little too much. We purchased this one to replace the one we bought a year ago. The first one's leg ripped off but only after some very rough play. Over all, a very good value for the money."
3,ok,"The book is good for those who have either watched the movie ""Hawaii"" or read the book by James Michener. The author compares the fiction with the actual historical figures in Hawaiian history. If you would rather just read a more historical account, read ""Grapes of Canaan."""
2,This book is about networking,I was disappointed. This book is about networking with other businesses within the community - which would be OK if it were named properly.
5,A multi-faceted and meticulous presentation,"The collaborative effort of authors Roger Keeran and Thomas Kenny, Socialism Betrayed: Behind The Collapse Of The Soviet Union 1917-1991 reveals the true story of what led to the overthrow of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. a multi-faceted and meticulous presentation of historical facts and personalities, the authors provide a wealth of insights and an especially perceptive analysis of the campaign to introduce capitalism from the top down, leading to the abandonment of collectivism, socialism, and the communist ideal. Socialism Betrayed is a welcome and much needed contribution to the continuing international and scholarly dialogue regarding how capitalism came to replace socialism as the governing economic and cultural systems of the Soviet Union, the downfall of global dominance of Russia, and the rise of the bloody ethnic conflicts and civil wars that we now see happening between sister states within the former communist coalition."
2,Not a Great Book,I was not impressed with this book because it did not have all of the cat breeds. It only had some. I returned this product. I do not recommend this product.
1,Poorly written trash,"In the hands of a writer like Stephen King or Ramsey Campbell this material might have worked. When I bought this book I hoped that I might have discovered another greater horror writer - but after reading only a couples of pages I knew that Campbell/King/Barker etc. can rest easy in their beds. Morris's writing style is atrocious, the use of similes and the conversation being particularly dire. I gave up reading after the first 20 or so pages and flicked ahead to see if anything scarey happened. It didn't ..."
5,Bone chilling and exciting!!,"Following the theme of his Ghost of Gettysburg book series, Mark Nesbitt has put together a great documentary on the more popular ghost stories of Gettysburg. Filmed in the actual areas in which the events occured, witnesses are interviewed or stories are told to bring the ghosts back to life! Stories of haunted Gettysburg College, movie theatre, battlefield and homesteads around town can send a drafty chill down anyone's spine. I highly recommend this video and also his Ghost of Gettysburg II video as well! 5 STARS!!"
4,Best with the Captain at the helm,"Yeah, I gotta say that ANYTHING that Damned did without Brian James looks pretty shabby next to the first album. That said, the only thing I can say against this album is that it's a tad overproduced, especially in terms of the guitar sound. This album sounds like it was a lot of fun to make, and there is a lot of branching out from the classic Damned sound on this record. While they hadn't yet gone goth, they were definitely showing the world how much they like the Doors on some of these tracks. Just about every song on this record has an amazing hook, and the sheer sonic diversity displayed here is staggering considering their recorded output prior to this point."
5,Outstanding book of tunes,This is one of the best books I've come across for classic English/Welsh/Scottish tunes. It's especially nice for flute and recorder playing. It also includes chords for guitar and a disc of the tunes. I initally checked this book out of the library but quickly realized I had to have it in my own personal library. It's a keeper!
2,Disappointment to anyone seeking in-depth analysis,"I was hoping this book would take a much more academic, intellectual look at psychoanalysis and the study of father-daughter relationships. Instead, the language and tone are simplistic, the anecdotes are quaint and pleasant, and the overall depth of research seems minimal. It may be a fine place to start as an overview on the topic, but this is definitely not the book to buy if you're searching for anything serious or memorable."
5,good for little pups,"I purchased this cuddle buddy for my medium-sized dog (a Japanese shiba inu) even though she's a little old for it (over a year old). She snuggles with her other toys but they are not soft so I thought she'd like it better. I started by giving it to her while she was already asleep, which helped keep her from chewing it like a regular toy and associate it with sleeping.It's too small for her to really cuddle or use as a pillow, but that's because she's older than the target age. She does like it but the problem came when we heated it up. That worked fine but instead of being comforted by the heat, she became interested in the internal pack and determined to get at it. Now we have to take it away from her since she chews around the velcro.I'm sure this is perfect for a little puppy as a surrogate for cuddles with littermates and mom's warmth."
3,Picture is deceiving in size,"Yes, it's well made, but this thing is tiny. It is smaller than my 1.5lb Peke-Poo pup. I 'm having a real hard time justifying the price for this thing - I mean, it's 7"" long. At least, it should be the size of a small puppy, not a flattened gerbil! I can't recommend this toy..."
1,Disappointed,"I was vey disappointed in this product. We had gotten a product close to this 3 years ago when we got our first pup. It worked so well that we passed it on to my brother when they got their first pup to. She ended up using it as a chew toy. But its so small, we are getting a great dane puppy this week. And she is already 5 times the size of this. The original one we had bought and I can no longer find was 4 times the size of this one. You could also use the velcro on the bottom to bunch up the stuffed rabbit so the puppy could actually cuddle with it, or you could lay it flat so the puppy could actually curl up and sleep on it. It was large enough that it stayed warm for most of the night if not all night. This little one is not worth the money to small and doesnt hold heat that long at all."
2,SOOO STUPID!,"First of all there is a bag of BUCKWHEAT inside this product! If you look on the list of toxic substances for animals buckwheat is on the list!! What kind of a company would put a toxic substance in a dog toy? Soo stupid!! Yes, it was good for keeping him company as a two month old puppy. But as soon as he was ready to chew on it It was harmful to him. I took the bag out and my dog loves playing the the toy case. But im sure a piece of cloth would have been just as good."
1,Not safe for puppies- Do not purchase,"Our new puppy is 12 weeks so I used this in his crate at night to help him settle without his littermates. The second time I used it he quickly bit open the toy and the sack of grains inside, spilling them all over his bedding. Hoping he did not ingest them- glad I have a vet appt. today. Our pup is not a destructive chewer and is not teething either. Do not give this toy to a young puppy- much safer to let him adjust on his own. Also did not stay warm long and is very small- much smaller than he is at 12 weeks old. I wish I still had the box as I would return it immediately. What a terrible idea."
4,Sweet cuddle toy,"Purchased this for our 8-week old German Shepherd Puppy. She slept with it the first night and then discovered that it was fun to chew. In order to prevent her from leaving stuff all over the house and risk choking, I removed the insert. Now she is happy to carry it around and chew on it. It seems tough enough (so far!) and she does sleep with it, too."
4,Set it up!,"I am an audio professional, but not overly obsessed w/ my home audio. This is a very good system for the price. One must adjust the settings in setup. Leaving the settings all at the default will result in flat low audio for music. Once you adjust the levels to each speaker & set the distance of each, your music will sound very good & your movies even better. A search online shows it's common for ppl to neglect to adjust the setup & complain ab audio from sony receivers like this one. I've had the system for three years & have had no problems. I had to call customer support once to use another sony remote & they were extremely helpful w/ that. There are other systems on par w/ this one & better, but this one is very good for the price."
4,Backcover:,"""Shy Megan Cooper was bld enough to answer the advertisement for a secretary in a London newspaper, but no sooner had she arrived on remote Harrow Island than her courage began to falter. Lord Ambrose Hawkins ruled his fogbound domain with a stern and unsmiling demeanor; the dark secrets of his mystery-enshrouded mansion were whispered in the village and in the echoing corridors of his vast estate.Not once but many times, Megan was warned that she should leave. Then the strange occurences began...Terrified now, Megan had been drawn so deeply into the web of evil intrigue that there was no one she could trust...no place she dared to hide...no way to escape the stormswept island that had become her prison!"""
2,Not my cup of tea,"This book didn't do a thing for me. The author suggests making faces in the mirror or laying down and feeling the Earth,...and that is supposed to help me get out of a slump? No, I think this book would appeal to those who take to yoga, or are into metaphysics, and holistic healing. I'm not saying that this is a bad book, I just think that it is suited for another target audience. The bottom line for me is that it didn't snap me out of anything, sorry."
5,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST J.LO SONG !,"SHE IS A WONDERFUL SONGWRITEN, ""ALL I HAVE"" WAS #1 IN BILLBOARD HOT 100 FOR 5 WEEKS !!!ALL I HAVE CD MAXI-SINGLE FEATURES:1.-ALBUM VERSION2.-RADIO EDIT3.-INSTRUMENTAL VERSION4.-ACAPELLA VERSION5.-VIDEOTHIS SINGLE IS AMAZING, I HOPE THE THIRD SINGLE FOR ""THIS IS ME...THEN"" THAT GONNA BE ""I'M GLAD"" HAVE A DANCE REMIXES !"
2,Cheap Watch,"I normally like almost every item with the Coleman name, this watch has been a big dissapointment. I ordered this watch because of the features on the face. It has military time listed on it, which is not common on most modern pocket watches. When the watch came, it did not function. I took the backing off, and found that the internal workings were very cheap and plastic. The battery that came with the item was dead. I replaced the battery, and the watch still did not work. I will need to take it to a watch shop. The seller is Target, the store does not normally stock this item. As for the watch, it is thin, light and does not have much substance to it. The top mount and time setting post is of an almost plastic material, the chain and belt clip are nice. With some work done, the watch could be nice, but as is, leaves something to be desired."
1,Terrible watch - you get less than you paid for,"I have owned two of these watches. The first one ceased keeping accurate time after I had the battery replaced. And I mean wildly inaccurate.The second one did not hold up well. The ring at the top of the watch came off (with normal in-and-out of the pocket use) and could not be replaced. I tried tightening it with pliers and it instantly came off. I used it anyway, and now it has ceased keeping accurate time (even though it is on its original battery).Setting the time is an adventure -- be sure that the button is fully back in or it will never start back up. And I have had the time set button pull out when I pulled the watch out of my pocket.It is a cheap watch -- but you get less than you paid for."
2,Not recommended. Avoid.,"I got this watch a year or two ago, and it was fine for awhile, but recently it has started losing big chunks of time. Not sure how it happens, but I'll look at when I know it's around 7:30 and it will say 3:15, or something on that order.It will keep time fine for a few days, then will go bad, I'll reset it, it will keep good time again for a few days, then it will go bad again. Can't find any rhyme or reason.Replaced the battery, but that didn't solve the problem.EDIT: finally got frustrated, bought another one. It soon started doing the same thing.A watch should do one thing: keep accurate time. This one doesn't. If you need a shiny $20 paperweight that will sometimes tell the correct time, buy it. If not, forget it.Sometimes the cheap turns out expensive.If I could drop my review down to one star, I would."
3,Nat is King,"Nat is King; BUT it is hard to tell from the ""stage/sound work"" if he is actually singing. I dont' mind sittng and watching someone just sing; that's what Nat does; but It is really hard to tell if he is ""live"" or 'Memorex"" ."
2,Product Description Misleading/Contradictory,"Amazon.com's Review states ""This package contains three sets of GKI/Bethlehem indoor/outdoor miniature lights."" There is only one 50-light set per item ordered. I would return if I didn't need the lights this season."
1,Lord! this game sucks,"First it is unfairly hard and you can't change the difficulty2. it crashes all the timedon't spend you money on this garbageI did, and regret it soooooo much.The disk made a good archery target though"
2,Brian May songs overpower this compilation,"What is this, a personal Brian May mix? Seriously, of 18 songs, 13 are composed by Brian. Only a handful are Freddie's (and one by Roger). Skip this compilation, it's neither anything new nor a well-rounded introduction to even just the ""rocking"" Queen sound."
3,"Queen Rocks: Another ""Best Of""","First of all, I have to say that this album is another Best Of, but it has ""No One But You"".1. They should have included ""Princes Of The Universe"", ""Gimme The Prize"" & ""The Hitman"".2. Where's Volume 2?3. Bad art work.Well... At least it has No One But You..."
3,it good pool but..,"I got this pool this summer the first of june make sure you set it on level ground and do not go over the fill line cause i had to put the pool up 4 times the first time it wasn't level the 2nd and 3rd time my mom was over at the edge and half of the water came out and then the 4th time we had a bad storm and it was passed the fill line which mean it went over the pool water and rain water made it over fill so i had to clean the whole pool and re do it and it filling up. so make sure you have level space mine off 3 inches on one side . id hate for you to make the same mistake i did. and i used regular bleach for mine cause i am not pay for expensive drops you put in the pool when it the same thing as bleach and it has keep the pool cleaned we do it every 2 weeks . and that a lie it doesn't take 30 mins to 15 mins to get up who ever put that lied cause it not easy as 1 , 2 , 3 .more like a few hours unless you have 3 hose pipes in the pool are your water goes faster then mine."
2,Intex above ground pool,"This should be the Intex set and reset and set again pool. I'm not sure what's wrong but after a couple of weeks the pool just suddenly loses a foot or more of water. It also seems to ""roll"" toward the pump filter as if the hoses were dragging it down. Our site is almost perfectly laser site level on super hard clay. No grass only 2 inches of premium sand. I spent 2 weeks carefully leveling the site and it still slowly rolls then collapses. Of course it still has a massive amount of water but I have no choice but to finish draining it and set it back up. This pool is pretty tough never had a leak except for the mysterious collapses. I think I've spent more time screwing around setting and resetting the pool than I have swimming."
5,GREAT POOL FOR EARLY SWIMMERS,"I HAVE HAD THIS POOL FOR 4YEARS NOW AND IT IS WONDERFUL. MY KIDS WHO ARE 9, 7, AND 5 YEARS OLD LOVE THIS. IT IS GREAT FOR TEACHING YOUR KIDS TO SWIM AND GETTING THEM USE TO WATER. I THINK THE POOL IS VERY DURABLE. BUT TO KEEP IN GOOD SHAPE I TOLD MY KIDS TO TAKE CARE OF IT ALSO BY STAYING OFF THE SIDES OF THE POOL AND TO USE A LADDER AND NOT TO CLIMB IN OR OUT OF THE POOL. MY KIDS ARE NOT AFRAID TO SWIM IN BIGGER POOLS DUE TO SWIMMING IN THIS POOL. AND I LOVE IT TO BECAUSE I GET IN AND ABLE TO PLAY AND SWIM WITH THE KIDS. BUT THE BEST THING TO DO WHEN YOU FIRST SET UP THE POOL DIG OUT A FLAT AREA FIRST THEN START SETTING IT, THAT WAY YEAR AFTER YEAR IT GOES UP EASIER AND QUICKER"
1,Not what you think...,"We only have had this pool for one season (purchased in the middle of the summer in 2010). There is a factory defect and the company will not cover it. I will NEVER purchase any product form INTEX, they do not back there product that they sell!! Not worth your money if you plan on using often with the family. Cause any damage is not covered by company and your money is gone."
5,WOW,"After reading the other reviews on this page, I need to think to myself that people are ignorant, these pools are GREAT for people who do not want to spend thousands of dollars on a pool, above ground or inground. Of course you need to find level ground, after all there are a few thousand gallons of water going into these pools, you need to avoid rips and tears in the liner, you need to keep your children in line, and not allow them to jump into the pool since it just adds stress to the pool, even though it is far from a normal blow up pool, it is still a blow up pool, you can not have children that destroy their toys in these pools, unless you want to be replacing it time and time again. Take it easy on them, keep up with the cleaning, and it will be fine."
4,Early Morning Explosion,"Bought the 15 x 42 May 2003, easy set up, easy fill,easy drain. Filled the second time it slowly leaned further & further to one side as the kids jumped around in it. At 3:30 a.m. the neighborhood awoke to a ""KABOOM"" and a flooding due to our pool ripping apart between the wall and the bottom. 3100 gallons of water gushed out all at once watering the whole neighborhood. We are lucky the kids were not in the pool when it exploded."
3,Wop-Sided Pool,"Not very happy with product. Had to set up pool in three different places, leveled all places and pool is still uneven on one side. Spent numerous hours on trying to set up correctly and still no luck. After moving pool for the third time noticed that the bottom of the pool had a small tear in liner (I'm sure due to moving it three times), not as durable as I thought and all of this happened within the first week. Don't feel like I have gotten my $230.00 worth."
4,Thinking about it,"I`m looking for a toy that will be both good inside and out. I know this is for outside but if you have the space and want a cool place to chill out, this might be it! I haven't purchsed this toy but it looks like a lot of fun! The only reson I rated this toy 3 stars for durability is because of other reviews. I know I said I don't have it yet but I could'nt write this review without giving it stars. So don't decide if you will buy this toy because of me."
4,Make Sure You Need It,Just as a heads up - open up your vacuum before you buy this and make sure that the belt hasn't just come loose rather than broken.
5,Perfect,"Great product, exactly what I needed. Very thick and durable maybe even better than the original ones that came with my vacuum."
3,"Right Belts, High Freight","$5 for belts, but $20's S/H for an 82 cent package. Cheaper to drive to Walmart."
5,Much better than I expected. The CD is GREAT!,"I thought that this crossover thing would be a mistake. I'm glad I was wrong. Ricky knows how to get to the audience in English and Spanish. One of the most amazing things on the CD is the way it mixes so many cultures. I've seen him perform other times, but I can't wait to see this concert in particular."
1,one hit wonder,only thing keeping him going is the teenyboppers and the huge Latin American population. He is a good actor though - loved him in the soaps. And have to admit that I love la vida loca - a little trite but very catchy
5,HOT! SULTRY! NON STOP LATIN BEAT!!,WOW! What an excellent album. Every song is great especially the dance mixes. The duet with Madonna is out of this world. Ricky Martin has delivered the hot Latin beat that has been missing state side.
3,At least it's not awful,"Several of Ricky's songs are pretty good actually, as pure dance music that is - e.g. the way-underrated Cup of Life, Maria, and the over-hyped Livin' La Vida Loca (I would discount Shake Your Bon Bon though since it is probably the most ridiculous song with the silliest lyrics and most hideous melody I've heard in quite a while). But, sorry, those are pretty much all there is in this CD. (O, the duet with Madonna is kind of interesting too.)"
4,Like a long lost friend,"I originally purchased this CD when first released years ago, but lost it somehow. I recently bought it again as a replacement. I had forgotten how much fun listening to Ricky Martin(in what I believe was his prime)was. Okay, the lyrics are not profound, but I dare you to sit still while listening to ""La Vida Loca"", Shake Your Bon Bon"" or ""The Cup of LIfe"". The slower ballads are also easy to listen to and I had forgotten about a duet with Madonna. Overall, a worthy purchase."
2,One Good Song And Lots Of Filler!.,Like other reviewers of this CD I bought it because I liked the song Livin La Vida Loca which is played a lot on radio stations and to be honest it's the only song I like on this CD! The other songs just don't appeal to me. He is a good singer though!
1,His crossover career is over.,"I have to admit that i bought into the Ricky Martin english crossover hype because of that song Livin La Vida Loca. It's an okay song, but unfortunately the radio played it to death. I bought the cd on the strength of that one song and tried hard to like the rest of the cd. Tried very hard! Other than Cup Of Life, which i found to have more energy and passion than La Vida Loca and is actually a better song, there isn't much left on the disc worth noting ..."
4,TRUTHLY A ENTERTAINER,"WHEN THE FIRST TIME I GOT HOLD OF THIS ALBUM,I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE IT PARTLY BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY LIKE THE FIRST SINGLE 'LIVIN LA VIDA LOCA' EVEN THOUGH IT WENT ON TO HIT #1 ON BILLBOARD FOR 5 STRAIGHT WEEKS,SELLING A MILLION COPIES.THE ALBUM ALSO WENT ON TO DEBUT AT #1 ON THE BILLBOARD TOP 200,SELLING MORE THAN 6.5 MILLION COPIES AT THIS MOMENT. DUE TO THE RELEASE OF 'SHE'S ALL I EVER HAD',I WAS COMPLETELY MESMERIZED BY THE VIDEO AND THE SONG ITSELF,WHEN I BEGAN TO LISTEN TO THE ALBUM ONCE MORE,IT GAVE ME A DIFFERENT SIDE OF THE RECORD THAT I NEVER DURING THE FIRST TIME TEYING OUT THE ALBUM.'SHAKE YOU BON BON' SOUNDS GREAT AS WELL. INDEED RICKY MARTIN IS SOMEONE THAT CAN LEADS THE AUDIENCE WELL DURING HIS CONCERT.HE'S TRUTHLY A GREAT ENTERTAINER IN TERMS OF MUSIC."
3,"Pretty good, but the first one's definitely better","I have to say that I was disappointed with this CD. After wearing out ""Vuelve,"" I was looking forward to more jazzy dance songs and heartfelt ballads but this CD doesn't deliver. It seems too commercialized and feels as if Ricky forgot his Latino roots and tried to mesh too much popular music in order to market this CD in the U.S. ..."
5,Puerto Rico does it better!!!!Ricky Martin Rules!!!,AWESOME!! This CD rocked! Invigorating and meaningful. Ricky Martin's first english album is truly fantastic.Ricky does it again! Again he puts together a complete CD.Very uplifting!! One of this years must haves and one of this decade best!Ricky Martin deserves the success he's getting. Ricky=A real Puerto Rican! YES!
4,A Good CD,"I first got this CD for the song Liivin' La Vida Loca. When I picked up the CD in the store I was suprised to see Madonna's name. So that made the choice easy for me, as I am a Madonna fan. I listened to the whole thing with a open ear. I loved the love songs, and the beat of the fast songs. The love song ease the soul, my favorite was She's All I Ever Had: and the upbeat song,Shake Your Bon-Bon, makes you want to get up and shake. I hope The big hype he is getting now doesn't jinx him. I hope to hear from Ricky a long time to come."
2,2 stars for 2 good songs.,"Ricky Martin's c-d only has 2 good songs- Living La Vida Loca and The Cup of Life. That's it. Even the one with Madonna is way awful that I can't even listen to it. ... we like it, we love it, and we expect more of it.ut I've been listening to him since he was singin Spanish only. Even if you are not interested in most of the English tracks, the CD is worth it with the ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" (English & español), and ""La Copa De La Vida"". great sounds of the Latin culture. Way to go, Ricky!"
1,Don't believe the hype!,"As far as hype and new albums goes don't believe the hype. He is supposed to be the ""Latin lover from Puerto Rico"". Well, I know I'm male, but I can't see what all the fuss is about. It has to be stated that Ricky Martin has the vocal style of Beck and the rhythm of the Gipsy Kings for that one track. The best song on the album has to be ""Living la vide loca"". The rest, unless you are really into soft romantic ballads, is tripe. Unfortunately, ""Living la vide loca"" is the highlight of the whole album. Never mind, better luck next time, that is if there is a next time!"
2,Nothing compared to Vuelve,"Ricky rocked on ""Vuelve"", but he kinda sinks on ""Ricky Martin"". I was expecting so much more and even rushed out to buy it the first day of its release; only to come home, flip it into my CD player and go ""Huh? That's it?"" ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" is possibly the best track on the album while ""Spanish Eyes"" and ""She's All I Ever Had"" are also respectable tunes. The 11th-hour Madonna duet should have been tossed out because they both sound absolutely lifeless on the track. The other duet with Meja is much better than ""Be Careful"". If you like ""Livin' La Vida Loca"", go out and get the single. If you wanna listen to more of Ricky, go get ""Vuelve"" cuz this cross-over doesn't cut the mustard."
2,Needs more songs like Livin' La Vida Loca!,"I bought this CD for Livin' La Vida Loca and I like that song but that and the Spanish version are the only songs on the CD that I like, the other songs really just don't do anything for me, they are very insipid compared to the energetic and electrifying Livin' La Vida Loca! Now I like Ricky Martin, he's handsome, sexy and he's got a great voice and what girl wouldn't like that and if he put out an album with more lively songs like Livin' La Vida Loca I would buy it in a second and I also have to say that I really don't mind that he also sings some songs in English his voice sounds great with whatever language he sings it in."
5,A GREAT CD!,"this cd brings out the mexican in me! i love ""spanish eyes"" it reminds me of the house in mexico that my grandma owns (i go down there every summer) i love his music and this cd is just absolutly great! i diffenitly recommend this cd! if you are in to latin music, then this cd is for you!"
4,Pretty Good...,"I liked this cd. I got a bootleg of the street so the track listing was different but it was still the same album. I especcially liked the Spanish versions. The best songs are the singles. I'd buy this only if you like ballads and not dance music. The duet with Madonna is not that good. Overall this was a pretty good album but not the best. If you like pop I suggest the Backstreet Boys' first album, Britney Spears' second album, the Christina Aguilera album, or the first album by Mandy Moore. ...ife is still on ok song after 2 years on the radio. ..."
3,"Not bad, not bad at all.","I agree with one reviewer who said his ballads were weak, but ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" and ""The Cup of Life"" more than make up for it. I mean, how many CD's do you buy that you like *every* song? Out of 14 tracks, I like 8 of 'em. Pretty darn good, I'd say.As for the ballads, the best one is his duet with Madonna, ""Be Careful."" His voice isn't strong enough to carry a ballad by himself. He's definitely better on the rowdy tunes...."
5,bueno,"muy buen disco. si eres fan de ricky martin tienes que comprar el cd ""aprendiendo a querer"" de jessica cristina, donde ricky grabo con jessica el tema ""todo es vida"". este tema es el primer duo de ricky en su carrera musical y fue grabado en 1992."
1,"His career is ""Livin La Vida"" over",Remember how big this guy was back in 99? It's a really good thing that it's 2004 now and this guy is now a complete and utter joke. Shake your bon bon indeed...
2,Crossover album not entirely satisfying,"I admit that I became a Ricky Martin convert after seeing his performance on the Grammies, and I also admit that I was seduced by the ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" video. I bought this CD and ""Vuelve"" at the same time, and there's no comparison. Ricky went way too commercial with his English-language CD. There are too many mediocre songs on it. The ones that really have some genuine spark are the songs sung in Spanish. ""Bella"" sounds so much better than the English version. ""Vuelve"" is far superior, not only in the choices of tunes, but in Ricky's vocal range.This self-titled CD is not the best introduction to the U.S. English-speaking audience. But I'm hopeful that Ricky will not let us down with his next CD."
1,kinda disappointing.,"I have listened to Ricky Martin's CD Vuelve, and i find that one much better. in some of the songs on this CD, his voice isn't as good as i thought it would be. all in all, this CD is very disappointing. i could only find 3-4 songs that i liked on this CD. i couldn't wait for this CD to come out, and when i got it, i was disappointed. i think ricky should stick to spanish music. ...thoroughly enjoying this CD. At least 4 more songs should ""make-it"" off this album, ""Spanish Eyes,"" ""She's All I Ever Had,"" ""Shake Your Bon-Bon,"" & ""Be Careful."" What a great voice for Latin & American cultures. The best for both worlds. Ricky's going nowhere but up! I can't wait for the next one. But until then I have two great pieces of work to ""shake my bon-bon"" and sing to!"
3,"""Livin La Vida Loca"" Awsome beat makes you wanna' dance!!!","Ricky Martin's Livin La Vida Loca Has great dancing beat. I really like his music but the radio stations have to play some of the other cuts from his c.d. I'n taking my girls to Wango Tango concert at Dodger Stadium on June 12,1999. Hopefully Ricky will give a great show along with Wil Smith,98(degrees) Blondie, Shaggie and the rest. See Ya....."
4,This CD (almost) rocked!,"this CD was really cool. But, you have to like some slow music. I mean, some of the music is fast and up-beat, but most of it isn't. But I over-all think it was really great. I just don't want you to get dissapointed when you hear all the slow music. All of the songs but one on the CD are about love."
5,The Latin sensation of the moment,"This is a well prepared and elaborated album, time paid off and it looks like it did for Ricky, this album has multiple mixes of latin rythms, pop music and disco that makes the album one of the best choices of the moment, no wonder he sweep the Grammys, Billboard Music Awards (latin and american), MTV video music awards (and music awards), and several in Europe. Good Job Ricky"
1,This is really bad...,"Everything about this album is wrong, the worst thing in it is Jesse. Avoid it at all cause..."
1,HA! HA! HA!,"This makes me laugh. This CD sux. The only reason it was put out is because Jesse works on MTV. Basiclly this album is just 80's butt rock. And trust me, I'm not just saying it sux cus' it's Jesse's band... it just flat out sux. I think he should stick to his gig at MTV."
1,"cero stars, actually...","Where's the option for cero stars? Oh well, all the songs are wrong and there's a simple explanation... Jesse doen't know anything about doing music"
3,Good Gun - lacks some features,"Overall, good crown nailer for the cost. DeWalt seems to be slipping in features though. This one doesn't come with the air chuck or a belt clip. The belt clip is extremely handy...would have paid extra to have it."
5,You can't go wrong with DeWalt...,"This stapler was perfect for the job I had to do - install checken wire. It made the job quick and easy. Trying to ""nail down"" the chicken wire using a hammer would have been slow and very frustrating."
3,Pandora's:puzzles are repetative,"I found the Pandora's puzzles a bit boring. While there are several types of puzzles, you have to solve the same type of puzzles over and over again. Only the difficulty of the puzzles change. If you like repetition then this will be fine but, if you like variety this is not for you."
2,Not much here...,I have to disagree with the other reviewers. I think that the puzzles were not mentally engaging. The interface is very pretty but the challenge just wasn't there!
3,not what I expected,well this is not what I expected there is a lot of useful information but not enough detail on wiring different types of systems but its good to learn a lot of terms and details on items worth the 4 bucks I paid.
3,Good read for an oblivious 13-year old,"I too saw an ad for this book in a magazine in 7th or 8th grade. I remember asking my teacher for permission to cut out the page so I could take it home to order it. I don't know if a 13-14 year old is a better or worse candidate for getting use out of this book than an older person. After reading and following the instructions in the book for some weeks I was a bit disappointed that I did not literally have a photographic memory. However it did affect some positive changes in my life. The most striking improvement was that I found I was a lot more observant of what was going on around me. Although I eventually abandoned the techniques in the book, in the next couple of years I went from being an average student with lots of potential to a outstanding student."
1,Instant Anger,"This book is a complete sham! The low price and promising improvements lured me to purchase this 60 page pamphlet. The two 5 star ratings are no doubtedly from authors, company workers, or the like. Either way - ""STEER CLEAR"" - Don't think twice about this book.I benefited in absolutely no way from this text."
5,Harry Potter,Such fun to read. I'm a fan and will be always. I have several books and enjoy the background of this wonderful series. Hat's off To J K Rowling.
5,Best book I've ever read.,"I had to read this book for a high school english class...and I actually read the book...all of it. The book is about a man telling the story of his life. The man is beginning to realize that that his life is near an end and he decides to take a trip with his cancer striken wife. The husband and wife take a road trip and reflect on their lives. The author sets up the story for an expected ending, that is still unbelievable. A must read."
2,Where is the CD?,The info - plus a comment by the AUTHOR - said that a CD of the music being discussed was part of the book purchase.If this is NOT TRUE you should highlight this fact in the sales offer.Ross Kane
2,disappointment,"Product arrive on time and work as promise. But I was highly disappointed with the quality. My wife use it to make yogurt and sour milk. She is careful how she use her tools. She read everything that come with the product and never abuse them. Approximate 30 day she notice the arm indicator was not moving. Regardless the price of a product it should not be broken in such a short time. We contact Amazon, they immediately reply and send us another one. Hopefully this one will last longer."
2,Does not give consistant accuracy,"We are a private, non-profit that delivers meals to seniors and we test meals monthly. These thermometers are inconsistant and usually not accurate. I would not recommend them. I had hoped that they would work as I liked the large dial for easy reading. I am having to replace all of them."
3,Decent thermometer,"I purchased this thermometer to find a temperature of water when I'm making coffee in my press. I wanted something that was going to be a fairly quick read and did not take batteries. So, I decided to try this out. The whole thing is built Ferley well, but the actual sensor part of the thermometer is not at the very tip which is somewhat unfortunate. Also, it is a fairly quick read, but as to it being instant, it is not. You definitely have to wait a couple seconds for it to reach the peak temperature. That is somewhat annoying when you're trying to find the temperature of water, because by the time it gets to the point where it's done reading, your water is already cooling-off."
1,Poor Construction. Flimsy product,"The head of the thermometer separated from the stem as it was very poorly attached. Right out of the box the dial never moved because it was so poorly made. Contacted the company for warranty information, but at this point I would just like a refund and a different thermometer altogether."
5,Excellent read,A great book on recordings of those who have had near death experiences. Love it! One of my favorite books!
5,Great book so far,"The book came late, package damaged and because of that it had damaged the book in the corner, however the book itself was new.!So far so good, love the book!:)"
4,Hiking,Used this item on a 3 day trip. Worked better than I imagined. A little smaller than anticipated. But for a simple hike n camp .. GREAT
5,A linguistic bag of tricks,"What Strunk & White did for syntax, Arthur Quinn does for rhetoric in this slim delightful book. The 60 figures covered enable sentences to say more than they mean, resonating with the writer's intent. Through examples drawn from sources as diverse as Homer, the Bible, Shakespeare, Romantic poetry and Abraham Lincoln's speeches, Quinn shows that concepts like metonymy and synecdoche, far from being erudite, are pervasive in the best literature.Anyone with an interest in effective writing will enjoy and benefit from this book."
4,Bien Hecho,"Pio Baroja is a master with his novel the Tree of Knowledge. Being able to identify with him as the main character is a soul-searching and thought-provoking privledge I recommend to anyone. He is a hero among Generation '98 authors, a true symbol of the Spanish spirit."
5,Unique product!,"Great example of American music with a diverse variety of performers. I love it. If you like history or folk music, you will too."
3,Not a perfect DVD but a must for fans,"The DVD release of ""Diva"" is a must for those who love this great film and for those who have never seen it. Take note that this DVD could have and should have had a far better transfer. Digital glitches are evident in dark sequences; the fantastic soundtrack has not been remixed into Dolby Digital 5.1; there is no supplementary material.Nevertheless, this DVD looks and sounds far better than any VHS release."
4,A Pleasant Easy Evening,"While this operetta is very light on plot it is enjoyable and humorous. What really makes this a treat is the music and the singing. It is exceptional. I find myself humming and mentally singing the songs days after watching it. It doesn't compare with Die Fledermaus but what a relaxing, enjoyable evening it provides!"
3,Comments on Tax Cut Premium,I had to wait until late February for HR Block to makecurrent updates to TaxCut 2005 Premium before I couldcomplete my tax return.I was not able to see any of the forms TaxCut wasfilling out until after they were all completed andready for printing and filing. This is just a bittoo opaque for my taste.
1,Buy TurboTax instead,"I've been using Turbotax for a few years now, and decided to try Taxcut this year simply because it was less expensive. It was a mistake. Taxcut was not able to update to the latest version, even tho it kept trying. I finally had to manually update the version, but Taxcut still did not recognize it. None of my forms would print without the update. I then bought Turbotax and was finished with my taxes in 1.5 hours. The difference between what Taxcut said I owed and what Turbotax said I owed was $1300, well worth the higher price of Turbotax."
5,Jane Austen Fans,"If you are a Jane Austen fan and obsessed with Pride and Prejudice, then this book is for you. It has text on one side and notes on the opposite. The notes explain words and terms that are either out of date or definitely British. It also helps with passages that seem inexplicable."
3,Amiable and Condescending,"In my title, I use ""condescending"" in its modern sense, not that of Mr. Collins. By ""amiable,"" I mean ""user friendly."" I find some useful material in the annotations, but I am left with a feeling that I'm not sure of the extent to which the annotator knows whereof he writes."
4,Worth the read.,"I agree with other reviewers that a lot of the annotations are obvious and annoying. Most people can figure out the intended meaning of ""sensible"" from context. It should be noted, however, that the author says in the introduction that he intends the book as a reference, and therefore repeats many definitions of words and annotates pretty much anything that could be annotated.That being said, there is a lot of good, interesting information- history and context that I couldn't find elsewhere, even when specifically searching for it. Many of the interpretations he gave made me think more about individual parts than I had before, even though I didn't agree with all of his opinions.This should not be your first, or even second read of P&P;, but if you've read it a few times, and are looking for more about the customs and traditions of the times, this is a good book for it."
4,Great Death Metal Album,"When I received this CD ... I thought that I was going to listen to some brutal death metal, but I was mistaken. This album has power, speed, brutallity, but also has a lot of melody. I JUST LOVE IT!!!If you like melodic death metal this is your album.The gloomy atmosphere of this Cd will really get you going crazy.. there's so much darkness on this music. The first song shows that Hypocrisy is such a mature band, with great vocals and great keyboards. This song makes me feel like it is the end of the world.I didnt rated it 5 stars because there are not enough fast songs as I wanted, but this doesnt mean that it is not an excelent album. My favourites songs are: Fractured Millenium, Fusion Programmed Minds and Time Warp."
5,Best Hyproscrisy ever!,"This is without a doubt, the BEST death metal release ever. While, the sound of the past 2 Hyprocrisy are still somewhat in effect, the sound goes so much further. Singer Peter is now singing clearly on about half of the tracks and the melody has been brought to the forefront. There are still brutally, fast-paced songs but there are also slow atmosperic doom rock power anthems. Wow! Truly a masterpiece and still uncompromising at the same time. UNGODLY! If you ever like one Hypocrisy song, you will love this entire CD."
1,To counteract the first review: 1 star,"I don't think that the first dude who reviewed the book has considered the character of the supposed co-author (God). That is, I find that the bible presents a picture of a god who I can't believe in. As I was unable to suspend my disbelief, the story fell apart under the weight of the ages.As another reviewer commented, there's no point in reviewing the bible. I would recommend that everybody read it, depsite the fact that it was possibly the most boring and pointless works of literature ever. But I have reviewed the bible because reviewer #1 did. No amount of commentary, indices, etc can make it interesting."
4,Good Bible,"I'm a protestant, but I have come to appreciate the expertise and insights of catholic scholars. I'm really fond of study bibles - I have a few - and I can say that this Bible is a great help for those who seek a better understanding of the biblical text."
4,A Very Good Study Bible Overall,"The Catholic Study Bible is one of the best study bibles for students and scholars of biblical criticism. The biggest asset is the extensive Reading Guides which are very helpful for gaining a historical perspective and general background on all books of the bible. The New American Bible translation and footnotes are understandable enough, but this study bible lacks an important feature: an index or concordance. This study bible is recommended mainly for those in serious critical bible study, not normally for the mainstream Christian."
5,The Catholic Study Bible,"This is great for those who are Catholic and want a deeper understanding of their faith, for those who want to study The Bible, for those who love scripture, and / or for those who just want to know what Christianity is all about."
1,Better Scholarship and Linguistics are Needed,"The NAB and the Catholic Study Bible appear to be a competitive attempt at more thorough Study Bibles decades in the making, (Scofield, Ryrie, NIV Study Bible, etc.). Although the attempt is genuine, the content is lacking both linguistically and in historical scholarship. The translation itself is lacking and shows only a basic understanding of the Greek/Hebrew/Aramaic sources. Also, an an odd isogetic bent is found throughout the NT in translating. The commentary is cold, overly literary, and lacks the true warmth and personal nature of the Holy Scriptures as they are found in the original sources, (Hebrew/Aramaic, Greek, and possibly Syriac). My hope is that a revision of this text will reveal a true desire to communicate the Sciptures accurately to Romanists. Unfortunately, as a scholar of the Scriptures I cannot recommend this volume."
5,report from the besieged city,"I have not yet read all of this, but was familiar with the title poem so wanted more from the author. Any reader of poetry would like this bood."
5,Finally... Hurray!!!!!,"After 6 months of collecting, I finally got my hands on a Legolas! This might not be big news to those in America, but they are so hard to find over here because toy-crazed freaks (or sculkers as my mum calls them) buy them as soon as they come out and sell them overseas. It was mostly worth the wait.There are a few odd things. Firstly, the bow that came with my one didn't have a string (and I haven't been bothered to try and put one on yet). Next, I'm a little annoyed...that you can't put the bow in the quiver, like with the Rohan Legolas. Also, he towers above the other figures by I guess, half an inch. But I guess, you can't have everything. So buy it!"
5,WHAT A SPLASH!!!,"This is our fourth year to have an Intex pool! We started with the smaller 12x36 or 42 and have graduated to the 18x48 as of two years ago. We actually could have used the smaller one for longer, but decided that bigger was better in our case! Ourselves, friends, and family enjoy this pool all season long. Not only is it fun for our child and our niece and nephews, but, we have adult time too alone and with friends! It's like a BIG hot-tub party for us, accept that we are not hot, but refreshed! Can't wait to get it up and running again this spring and summer! One more thing, we had someone get in the pool and puncture it (very small hole, and they don't puncture easily at all) and were able to use a tiny bit of the repair kit and sealed it completely. Haven't had one problem since! You can't even tell! THIS IS A PERFECT SUMMER PLEASURE FOR ALL!!!!"
3,Not At All Happy!,"This is a MAJOR pain to set up... must layout PERFECTLY flat and find a level surface for the pool will sag. If you lean on the side there the pool may turn into a waterfall as hundreds or gallons of water propel your small children over the rim and onto the hard ground! After 1 season, my pump's motor stopped working. If you are going to buy a portable pool, get the one with the posts that provide wall support, otherwise you will have a 18' water ballon!"
5,read this!,no words!!just read it!!my words are nothing comparing to Bahagavad Gita!!read it whoever you are!Thanx
2,Unimpressive results - 2 lbs loss,"I read the book and followed it exactly. It's not a hard diet to stay on, especially in the winter time. However I only lost 2 lbs (and I'm a hefty guy). I've lost more before just from cutting back portions. I expected better results."
5,Excellent overview of technology and techniques,The authors provide an excellent treatment of the problems associated with starting and maintaining virtual teams. An excellent concise presentation of working with differences in culture is presented. Many technology alternatives to facilitate group interaction and collaboration are also presented. The strengths and weaknesses of each technology are given for several different problem solving situations. I would recommend this book to anyone who must solve problems with others who are off site.
3,Fun Movies,"good movie,cast and full of lots of laughs and romance. suitable for all ages! although its not better than the first movie Bring It On."
1,Utter crap,"This movie is extremely racist and makes white people look bad. Escpecially when one white girl calls another white girl a ""white girl"" like it is an insult. Pathetic."
1,Elite 8.5 Slow cooker MST-800V,I would Not recomend this cooker to anyone. When in use the out side of the cooker is so HOT it melted the OFF High Low instructions on the front of Cooker. Dangerously Hot on outside.
1,slow cooker,"I returned this product today. I recently bought this cooker for a friend and he was very happy with his. I decided to purchase one for my family. We were not happy with it from the first use. The auto function never changed from HOT to cool. I decided to give it another try using only the low setting. On low, the liquid rapidly boiled and the cooker and the surrounding area were very hot to the touch. While I love the size and shape, it is not a consistently safe unit. It may be that this one is a lemon and others are OK, but I wouldn't chance a replacement cooker."
2,Nice size but is not a quality unit,"I was more than excited to have a slow cooker large enough to cook the quantity I like to cook at one time, so that I can freeze for later use. During the first use, the sticker around the front dial and light melted into a rolled up mess, then fell onto my counter and hardened when it cooled. Granted I could have etched in the information on the front of the unit into the plastic, but I worried that if the machine didn't even survive the first use in one piece, then it wasn't worth keeping. I returned it and am back researching for a new one."
1,Not working,"This item did not work right out of the box, I had loaded it up to have a nice Sunday dinner and pluged it in and low and behold it did not work. It just would not come on ,so I checked the fuse on the wall plug and that was fine so I had to make arrangements to send it back and throw the food a way, so need less to say I was not happy with that, but I was able to get my money back from Amazon. Martin Hannon"
1,gets VERY hot!,This cooker gets extremely hot on both the high and low settings. It would surely ignite a dish towel or paper towel if it came in contact for a while. I also received a 2nd degree burn on my wrist when I touched the unit. I would not dare leave this cooker unattended or sleep while it is on. I called customer service to express my concerns and they told me they would send me a new base. A month later I am still waiting and they no longer answer my emails.I made the mistake of buying this pot while on vacation at a store that is not in my area. Otherwise I would have returned it right away.
2,Colored backing defeats purpose,"I have one bad eye. It doesn't look funny from the outside, but when I'm in a theatre watching a performance (live or movies) I like to cover the bad eye so it doesn't undermine the clarity of my vision. So I got these patches so I'd have something around to cover the bad eye. I liked the different colors, kind of fun. However the backing of these patches are the same color as the front. This can be distracting because now my bad eye is seeing nothing but pink or green or whatever. This undermines the benefits of wearing the patch. I'm sure that these patches would be fine for a children's party but for those who need patches to improve vision in a darkened theatre, better to get a patch with a black background."
4,The Honeymooners Game Set,I bought this for my husband who loves the Honeymooners. It is a great collectible gift and a fun game to play.
3,A Moment of Clarity is a Death song!!!,"Came out about a year before this album was released on Death's album, The Sound of Perseverance. The REAL A Moment of Clarity by Death is also far superior to Satyricon's song. I loved Nemesis but this is an insult to THE GREATEST EXTREME METAL band ever, Death."
1,Contains inaccuracies,"I bought this book in preparation for diving Nitrox on a dive vacation. One of the tables simply did not make sense. I contacted the publisher, who, after at least 2 emails from me, provided me with corrections by .pdf file. I subsequently asked the publisher how it intended to address the clear inaccuracies in this book and received no response. Further, although the publisher includes errata for certain books on its website (www.bestpub.com), despite my notification of these errors, it has issued no similar errata for ""Recreational Nitrox."" In my opinion, anyone relying upon this book without inquiring into the validity of the information provided therein is misplacing their reliance."
3,"Good, but not great.","When sawing at non-extreme angles, the box works well. When you start getting too far off center, however, the saw gets wedged against the plastic from the force of the sawing and gets stuck. The included saw is actually quite nice, however, and with most light woods such as Balsa you can use the box to make a slight line on top of the wood and then you can just continue the cut by hand without the box. This has worked for me on the extreme angle cutting. This package is not expensive so I am basically happy with the purchase but not thrilled."
4,perfect lil miter box,"I bought this miter because I work with styrene making models and dioramas . After checking the prices of all the other brands and checking on thier sizes this one worked for me . its the perfect size if your using either plastruct or evergreen styreen and the fact it has built in pegs which hold your plastic in place while you cut is great . It comes with a back saw thats fairly well made and is a really good size , while I have big hands I dont have sausage fingers so it fits great . Now how long the blade will last I dont know we'll see but I can always get an exacto knife later .The seller shipped it quick and I got exactley what I asked for its totaly worth the money ."
5,cooking,"I had checked this book out from the library and was so impressed with it, decided to buy it from you.As usual, you are the ones I contact first. We just love the book, and the price was great. Also, it arrivedin record time! You are the best!!!!Donna"
1,Didn't get much help from this one,"Another lousy cookbook from Martin Yan. The only thing I got out of it was the spicy garlic sauce that I altered to make Chicken with garlic sauce. That sauce recipe was in a recipe with eggs. I couldn't get anything else out of this cook book. I spent some time with it in a book store before I decided to buy it. But I couldn't agree wth many of the recipes in the book. I wonder if anything in his recipes are kitchen tested. I was looking specifically for sauces and there isn't one recipe in this book that I could make to taste like what I wanted, either at a Chinese-American restaurant I have gone to in the 'burbs or a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. Or the recipe given I already have another method to make. This one went in the recycle bin along with his Chinatown Cooking one. The adage, ""Never trust a skinny chef,"" applies well to Martin Yan."
2,Not as good as others,I have read other ARS books; this one was not as good as others. THe middle and ending definately did not live up to the beginning.
2,Unbelievable!,"I have read a number of this author's books and found them to be really good vacation reading. So, I looked forward to starting this one with some anticipation. However, what I found was a bunch of snobbish tripe!It wasn't worth wading through to get to the utterly impossible ending. If you are addicted to Anne Rivers Siddons you just might need to read it for a fix, but it wouldn't be a quick one. It takes a quite a while to finish because of the slow moving and boring descriptions of the beach, the homes, the clothing everyone wears, and the shallow characters. If your reading time is precious to you, as mine is, I'd skip it entirelyPurchase at your own risk!"
1,I lost patience with this book very quickly,"I have never read another book by this author, but picked this one up at the library after I thought the book jacket blurb sounded promising. What I found was a tedious novel with very little plot, only a few spurts of good writing, and an ending that seemed to be a desperate twist to make it into a murder mystery. The characters were very poorly developed and had the most tedious lives you can imagine. Maybe this is how the rich live in Charleston, but it certainly didn't make for good reading. I simply skimmed through the last two-thirds of the book, and don't think I missed a thing."
4,"Even if you enjoy it, you don't have to like it","I love Siddons's books. I'll read anything that has her byline on it and I'll enjoy it whether I like it or not!How can that be, you ask? Well, she's a pictoral writer. By that I mean her words conjure mental pictures of characters and scenes in the reader's mind. The setting she writes about in ISLANDS (the coastal South) is beloved and familiar to me. She has the ability to create a charming world for the reader that is a delight to experience.All that said, although I enjoyed reading ISLANDS, I felt the story was weak. The ending seemed dux ex machina and the characters were too familiar to avoid the feeling that they were cliches.She's still my favorite author and I'll read every book she writes, but ISLANDS strikes me as a book written by someone who no longer has anything to say. Ms. Siddons has lived in her world so long and written it so well that it's time to stretch her talent with something new."
2,Would not recommend,I tried making biscuits twice and ended up throwing out both batches. It has a strange taste to it and the consistency was not good. I would recommend gluten free bisquick over this.
1,Totally Disappointed,"I like this Cannon Santa Cruz bath towel design (classic). I used to buy them from Sears years ago but they don't carry it anymore. I bought 8 pcs of different colors and was very excited about it. When I used it, I was totally disapointed of the quality. In the tag it says 100 % cotton but it does not absorbed water from your skin well unlike any other cotton bath towels. I wonder if this is a true Cannon or not. I don't use them anymore."
3,"Somewhat boring, no action","There is no action in this tape. All it is pretty much is the Z fighters sitting on their butts trying too hard to think up a way to kill Majin Buu. Goku thinks of one, he wants to teach Goten and Trunks the fusion dance, so that they can fuse together and become really strong. However, Gotenks does not appear in this tape, so don't look for him. Everybody finds out that Vegeta is dead and Bulma and Trunks don't take it so well. Piccolo and Goku think that Gohan is dead but actually he is taken to the Supreme Kai's planet to remove the legendary Z Sword from a huge cliff. By going Super Saiyan, Gohan crumbles the ground beneath the sword, allowing him to pull it out. I recommend this video to complete your collection, but the episodes are pretty much just trash. The music that played when Gohan was removing the Z Sword was pretty cool, though."
2,The Gypsy Baron,"Transforming a stage operetta into an outdoor film is difficult, but the crew should have tried harder. The singing is fine, but the handling is so heavy-handed that it hardly seems worth the bother. The 1950s German film of ""the Gypsy Baron"" was infinitely better. Buy this disc only if you cannot find a good recording, since this operetta is better heard that seen."
4,"""Campy"" at It's best!","If you like campy horror flicks or ""Horror comedy"", then Basket Case is right up your ally. Basket case is a film about a young man who moves into a shady apartment in New York. People who meet him find him a little odd because he is always carrying a basket with him. It is later reveled that what he is carryig is his grotesquely deformed siamese twin. When I say deformed, I mean it. It gave me the freaking creeps.(It makes terrible noises when it's mad)Well, the young man soon starts to see a cute desk girl who he meets at his doctors office. The two start to date but it turns out the his brother in the basket has some murderous ""Seperation"" issues. The production is B grade. The acting is so corny its hilarious but ""Basket Case"" still delivers enough scares to keep you interested. The beauty of the film is that it knows it's corny but it makes it's corniness one of it's strengths. If you're a fan of B horror or just horror in general ""Basket Case"" is a must see."
3,Engaging low budget horror,One of the best horror movies of the 80's.This extrememly low budget masterpiece is a must see for all horror film fans. The movie was shot in 16mm but the DVD transfer looks pretty clean. A lot better than previous video transfers of this title.
5,One of my favorites,I remember reading this book when I was in the second grade. I am now 35 years old and just seeing the cover of this book brings up such great memories. If you should choose to get this book it is something your children will remember and enjoy.
4,Tylina's Review on Teen Ink,"This book is a good book for all teens to read. All teens' deal with many different problems growing up weather it's with your best friend, a teacher, their parents or a boyfriend/girlfriend. The problems in this book deals with common problems of a teenager's life. This book tells teens how to deal with their problems, instead of making the wrong decision. These stories are not just helpful they are interesting. An interesting book can grab your attention and make you want to keep reading. The stories in this book grab your attention and make you want to finish the whole book. I enjoy a book that can grab your attention and make you feel like you can't put it down. This book is rated four stars with me because it's good but just not perfect but it near perfect."
1,Not Really Great..,"I thought this book would be a good book, but after I ordered it from amazon.com, then I started to read it. Most of the stories are confusing and sometimes dont make any sense, the poetry is weird, I think chicken soup is way better! Its an okay book, but if would have know it was going to be like this I wouldnt have bought it."
4,Quality Work Shirt,"These are easily my favorite shirts. They fit particularly well on big guys like myself, which can be a very hit or miss proposition with some other products' sizing. Not so with these. When they first arrive, you will notice the fabric is somewhat stiff and a bit scratchy against the skin, but after they've been worn and washed a few times they soften up and get comfortable. They rarely require ironing, but can be a bit of a lint magnet at times - nothing a lint roller can't fix, though. You will find the fabric and colors are nearly identical to some lines of Dickies work pants as well, which is nice if you need a uniform look."
5,Great Buy!!!!,These shirts were great and they all the sizes I needed for my guys. From M to 5x. The men loved the shirts too and it looked great with khaki pants.
3,Larger than expected,I was expecting a XL but it turns out that dickies' XL means a normal XXL or XXXL. Other than that it seems fine.
5,great shirt,I got this shirt to replace my other work shirt. It was also a dickies shirt.I wear it everyday in a metal shop and only have to buy one per year
4,Just what I wanted,I wear large shirts and have to custom order them because I like having two pockets but not having the size of one pocket restricted by a pencil slot. In other words I actually use my pockets. This shirt was exactly what I wanted.
2,Best Resumes for Attorneys,"This should be entiled ""Best Resumes for Attorneys at the Top of your Class, (As for the rest of you, we're not concerned)."" Hey, everyone knows law is extremely competitive, but shouldn't there be something in this book for someone not in top 20% or above. Every sample resume involves being at the top of your class. Obviously, I didn't graduate in the stratosphere but I am far from being alone, 80+%. Also, I've been able to eke out a decent practice despite this. I've used this book for the past few years and it is helpful because there is a large selection of sample resumes and cover letters to choose from, but I've often chuckled to myself when doing so, because for having such a large selection of examples for so many areas of the law, it just deals with the ""elite."" It never addresses anyone who might be below this standard. That is why I think that its use is somewhat limited and not realistic."
1,"Should be entitled ""Simple Resumes for Top Attorneys only""","This is probably the worst book I've ever reviewed on the subject. Sure, it's great if you are an attorney from a top 10 school at the top 20% of your class, but still are not bright enough to figure out the most basic of tactics. True, the gatekeepers for the elite jobs are not authorized to think outside of the box, and therefore resumes based on these tips will appeal to them; on the other hand, there is no reason that these attorneys should have to put more than a cursory search together as these employers will be chasing them. As to the rest of us presumably unqualified professionals, the book is of absolutely no relevance. Based on this, I presume that the authors (legal recruiters) are likewise only interested in finding jobs for the papered best and brightest."
2,Everything sounds the same,"This is the first CD I've had from this group, and was hoping for something that sounded Irish. Unfortunately, both myself and my wife thought all the songs were basically the same and the group did nothing for us at all. Each to his/her own, but I am not impressed at all and this will be the last CD from the Corrs."
3,The silliest of the Incarnations of Immortality,"The first book in the series was great, full of interesting ideas and ponderings about the nature of good, evil, and death. This book was rather devoid of that. I ended up wondering whether the protaganist ever actually did his job, and if so, did it have more to it than taxi-ing Fate around time? The only point to this book, it seems, is to provide some background material for the climax of the series. Otherwise, it was just Norton playing fantasy games with Satan."
2,Not even as good as Anthony can be,"I've been going through this phase of re-reading books that I first read when I was younger, and like many pre-teens I had been an avid reader of Piers Anthony. It's interesting that I find now what I also found true then-- namely, that the first Piers Anthony book in any given series is always the best, with the following books becoming increasingly sillier and sillier. The first book in the incarnations of immortality series had some clever and original ideas, but past that it lapsed into the besetting Anthony sins of pre-adolescent boy fantasy and deeply goofy plot."
2,"Mediocre Story, Interesting Idea","Seriously. I wanted to like this book. The concept was so fun. The incarnation on time living backwards? sweet.But somehow Piers Anthony managed to make the whole thing boring. Perhaps it was the quasi sci-fi ""magic come out of the closet and the Earth it made whole again"" setting. Perhaps it was the plodding pace. Perhaps it was the over-long interludes in supposed anti-mater galaxies that (SPOILER) were just illusions. Do I feel bad publishing a spoiler? NO! Because I they didn't feel so much list satanic illusions (per the plot) as weak filler for an underdeveloped plot. Sure, some campy fun that makes laughs of pulp sci-fi and epic fantasy... but for every page of intentionally overwrought ""illusion"" I would have prefered a single paragraph of well-written storyline.I finished the book because I like to finish books and I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't."
2,Just read it to get on with the series,Ok - this one is SOOO not as good as the first... or the other books in the series...Just get through this one so that you have a basic understanding of Chronos and proceed to Fate... Trust me - Fate is worth it!
3,"OK, I guess","I couldn't work up much interest in this book. It started out well, but went downhill. There were parts that didn't seem to have been thought through very well; there were some problems I thought of that didn't seem to have occurred to the author. I didn't find it very confusing, as others did: Several parts *would* have been confusing, except that I wasn't interested enough to think them over.Also, I didn't like Piers Anthony's afterword much. Although I could relate to it more than to some of the characters in the book, it was filled with unnecessary details, and it seemed very arrogant (""I *am* a world-class writer"", Anthony declares).The plot kind of went nowhere (there was no very obvious climax or complication), and there were several subplots that felt like a waste of my time (Time, ha ha, get it?). Overall it was an okay book, but it's far from the thought-provoking masterpiece the back cover suggests it is."
3,Great-- if you don't pack a lot,"The bag is cute, yes, but is it that great for carrying things? Not really. You'd have to be a breast feeding minimalist to get this to work. The pockets on the inside are inconviently shaped and my bag's inside ripped very easily. I use this bag and don't like it very much, but it can work if you really try."
2,Lousy Phone!,I purchased this phone because it was a motorola. Big mistake....worst reception I have every had with a cell phone! Don't buy it.
4,Basic,"Its a phone. It makes calls, it sends text messages, and can even take some pictures. If you're sharp, you can upload a custom ringtone to the phone.Can be pretty slow...typing a text message takes a while, since the text doesn't show up for half a second to a second. Address book searching and scrolling is similar; don't press a button a few times to scroll down one thing, you will end up at the bottom."
5,Libertarian Sci-Fi at it's best,"The novel is a fast pace, exciting, vivid account of the last enclave of freedom in the human universe and their struggle against the communo-socialist power brokers who seek to enslave them. The main character around which the story swirls, Kendra, is a female from earth who flees to Grainne (the Freehold) to escape a plot to scapegoat her in a typical military/corporate scandal. She is shocked at the unbridled freedom she enounters in her new home but slowly adjusts to her new found liberty. In the end does our hero go back to Earth and slavery or stay on Grainne and remain free? Does the Freehold remain free or do the forces of tyranny prevail? You'll have to find out for yourself in this page turner! I couldn't put it down."
2,Could use an edit,"This novel reads like a mashup of Heinlein's worst works, with a bit too much anti-government propaganda thrown in.Don't get me wrong, I love Heinlein -- but the Earth Kendra comes from is too much like a futuristic China than anything I recognize about the United States.Seriously, I know people complain about lowered educational standards, but do you honestly think any self-described 'political scientist' would not know what the term ""empirical data"" means?Overall, the book could use a good editor. And really, just eliminate the scenes about gardening."
2,Go Back to the SOURCES,"THIS BOOK WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT> It used mostly secondary sources, which were eclectically selected, and ignored all of the secondary literature about women in the Revolution, including Kerber, Norton, and Hoff, among others. To choose The World of John Cleaveland (a great book but about a little town in Massachusetts) as your community study that proves all sorts of economic theses, etc. and ignore Women of the Republic is not only peculiar; it is irresponsible. There was no fresh research and although it was well written, it was no Creation of the American Republic."
3,Decent Show while it lasted,"To be honest the main reason to watch this show is the beautiful Milena Govich, the 13 episodes of the 1 and only season were typical courtroom drama fare seen many times before. Milena makes the show more watchable just because she's so gorgeous you can't take your eyes off of her. I purchased the dvd set only because she's in it and i am happy i did."
2,it was a sad movie but I liked corey haim in it!,"Seeing as this was one of corey's film's i hadn't seen,i thought it looked good.Corey's character was goneNew Terminal Hotelvery early in the movie.That was the reason i got it,to see him in it.Ugh!I think his character was high too,,i loved gorey corey and yet the writer killed him off like corey and the media did, with his career cuz of drugs.Wasn't he sober by then? I'm glad the director gave him a 2nd chance at an acting career! I would've liked to see him it longer.the movie role was short for his character.but i still liked him in it.May Corey live on though in the matinee in the sky.:0)"
3,Meh,Worked ok but my freakishly oily skin adapted to it quickly and the shine control didn't last as long as I'd hope. Check out Skindinavia No Shine for about the same price with better shine control.
4,Not the oil prevention I had hoped for.,"Its a good primer, but my face tends to still get very oily later in the day due to my foundation. I have been trying every brand under the sun. I may have had too high of an expectation. It's just as good as the expensive brands, although it is very small. However, the directions state ""apply sparingly."" It is a good alternative to the silicone based (which don't work) or expensive brands."
2,Was looking for a Medical Journal,"I am a senior and I find the notebook disappointing. There are not enough Tabs. Only one page for Recent and Past Surgeries, one page For Current Meds, Really? And one page Current Tx/Test then we go to Doctor/Office Visits, would you believe 79 pages? The over all design is inadequate for an adult. I plan to give mine away."
1,Couldn't get through the introduction,"""There are about 49,000 metric gigatons of carbon on Earth today, making it the fourth most plentiful element in the universe""... ""Seven hundred and fifty gigatons of carbon hang in the atmosphere, accounting for less than 1 percent of the world's carbon.""Was this book edited at all? Yes, while carbon IS the fourth most plentiful element in the universe, the statistical distribution of elements on earth is relatively unique compared to the rest of the universe. This could be chalked up to ignorance of what the word ""universe"" means, I suppose. However the next error, the ""less than 1 percent"" line, isn't even close to correct. I'm no math major, but I'm pretty sure 1% of 49,000 is 490, which is quite a bit less than 750. How do blatant, elementary math errors make it into a published book? And how can the author be taken seriously after introducing such errors?"
4,"Davis, Scofield, Foster make a great combination","I have no idea why Columbia has not remastered this one, it is an excellent, blues-driven album from 1983. It has the same electricity and energy of Miles' 70s recordings, but with less of the chaos. To be certiain, Marcus Miller and Mike Stern are great. However, for me, the key to why this album is so good is the presence of John Scofield on guitar and Al Foster on drums. The two collaborated with Joe Henderson to do a tribute to Miles in the 1990s and it is great to hear them with meastro himself in this set."
4,"Plenty big, and nice for the price","This is a good sized spoon, maybe even a little on the large size - it's about 10"" long by 2-1/4"" wide, and nicely proportioned.Substantial feeling. The handle is fairly flat, not rounded like some pieces, but nicely thick.Look closely at the photo, there's a little ridge design along the end of the handle. Attractive, but just so you're not surprised when you see it.An exact match for the oversized serving spoon, so they can ... spoon in your drawer."
1,Appallingly Bankrupt of Intellectual Integrity,"Michael Barone in his time did good work: so this re hash of Tom Sowell's elderly ""Ethnic America"" (1981)is embarrassing to read. But far worse, it is deeply dihonest: puporting to discuss the issue of immigration and cultural transformation Barrone deals with dissenters by simply ignoring them. Neither my brother's ""Alien Nation"" (1995) nor Roy Beck's ""The Case against Immigration"" (1996) nor Chilton Williamson's ""The Immigration Mistique"" (1996) are graced by a single reference."
2,A Major Disappointment,"Well, the extras are good, and it does seem to be the German version, with a choice of that language or English. The quality, on the other hand, is inferior to the Criterion laserdisc, which is ten years old and left much room for improvement even when it was new. The video is badly compressed, causing noticeable tiling, and the print is quite grainy. This looks pretty lousy even on a 19' monitor. The only advantage I can see is that it is slightly less cropped than the Criterion. The previous five star review reads suspiciously like a press release."
5,excellent book,"I would highly recommend this book to any law student who is taking a class on patent law. Professor Mueller is an excellent writer, and she explains otherwise complex subjects in a way that is both comprehensive and easy to understand.If you're taking a class on patent law, this book is simply indispensable."
5,Fantastic performances,"Christoph von Dohnanyi and the Vienna Philharmonic truly deliver fantastic readings of these three popular symphonies by Felix Mendelssohn. The Vienna Philharmonic (as always) is well balanced, very transparent, and well rehearsed; they play incisively and with total conviction. The playing is especially inspired in the Scottish Symphony, where the dialogue between wind and strings is delightful. However, the best parts of this set are the ""filler"" overtures. Both Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage and Fingal's Cave are played to the hilt. Dohnanyi conducts the symphonies tightly, and that taught quality makes these recordings very exciting. My only complaint would be that, at times, the orchestra sounds a bit small. Still, overall, a wonderful compilation by London Decca."
2,Falls Flat,"I chose this book because I was looking for a good gay mystery series and it sounded entertaining. Unfortunately,the plot and characters are extremely trite and one-dimensional. How tiresome it is to use gay characters for comic relief.Although it bills itself as funny, I didn't crack a smile or laugh once during the whole book. All in all, it was not very well written and I do NOT look forward to his future work. I was left counting the pages until the ending."
3,I Accuse This Movie of Being Funny,Who knew that Truck Farming was so interesting or that the life of Jimmy the Liar was so complex. The SOL knows. This one featured Joel and the bots making fun of one of the longest soaps I have ever seen. Jimmy wins the essay contest at school and tells everybody about his great mother who in reality is a lush and dad is a corpse. He meets Kitty and then he joins the mob. Not a movie for the faint of heart but thank good Joel is there to save the day. There is also a pretty rotten truck farming short.
5,Truck farming short,"I can't believe no one has mentioned the truck farming short! While the boys have seen much funnier shorts, I think that this one is the best part of this movie. As usual, the Encyclopedia Brittanica company puts a positive spin on things like migrant labor and DDT. As usual, Joel & co. shoot them down. Overall, a quality production."
4,It was great to see an opera that is not often presented.,I was not crazy about the opera but I was happy to get a chance to see it. I thought Marilyn Horn was terrific. I enjoyed the set and the costumes.
3,Not sure I'd buy this again.,"Seemed to work (anectdotal evidence during pollen/allergy season), but not sure how well. Not much dust trapped on the screen or pre-filter. Not sure what happened. It was worth a try, and seems to work a little bit (seems to have cut down on fresh paint smell in two bedrooms we painted).I would investigate other units before buying this one."
4,Just What I Was Looking For,A great air cleaner for the small apartment I live in and I love the fact that I never hace to purchase a new filter for it. Just remove the filter and clean !!!
3,bittersweet,"The mirror ball has small glass squares for extra sparkle which makes me happy, however out of the box there were eight squares that were either cracked or chipped. These squares are in the same general area so it's assumed that the ball was impacted at some point. The American DJ box had obviously been re-taped which leads me to believe this product was returned and reissued. On arrival there were smudges and hand prints on the ball as well. Given the relatively low price with Amazon Prime, it's not worth my while to return the item, but it would be nice if Amazon not advertise a ""new"" product when clearly it's been previously handled/gently damaged. From a distance the damage is barely noticeable, but annoying nonetheless."
1,Failed to entertain,My mom and I really enjoyed Funny Girl but felt Funny Lady failed to be funny or fulfilling. Thought it was a flop
2,"Rancid, except for the ""Great Day"" number","I attended the Filmex L.A. premiere of this alleged musical in the spring of 1975. At the time, it was highly anticipated and did make good money for Columbia Pictures. Even the stars in attendance that night like Henry (Fonzi) Winkler, Roddy McDowall and Rosalind Russell, seemed bored by it.And no wonder. The character of Fanny Brice in this film is completely different that she was in Funny Girl. The story is dull and goes nowhere. Fanny has become a hardened woman and not a very nice one. James Caan is poorly cast. as Billy Rose, who tries to turn a professional relationship into a personal one. The whole thing is for her fans only. A few of the songs are nice and the musical numbers work well. The musical number ""Great Day"" is stunningly well done. It is a shame the rest of the film didn't meet this level."
2,A struggle to read,The format of this book makes it real hard to read and detracts greatly from the content. Your eyes have to dart from one side of a page to the other and back again then to the middle. The content is important but on the edge of the spectrum which makes it even more difficult to read at times with the far fetched concepts. I'm not a big fan of this one.
2,Disappointing,"Ummm... I must say, I was expecting something a bit more vibrant than this. This whole CD seemed flat and lifeless in comparison to the score heard in the actual film. I did like the sections of dialouge, and the music is still reminiscent of the film, but it just sounds like two guys made the recording in their basement instead of an actual studio that made this CD, I'm sorely disappointed with this product."
4,SWEET HOMER ALABAMA,"A nice debut by yet another blue collar southern bard. It reminds one of Harry Crews or Larry Brown. God help me for saying this, but Franklin portrays a kind of pastoral weirdness and brutality with an unflinching eye. At some point, readers are going to have to ask how much unflinching they can take.Some of the early stories in the book are not as realized as they might be, but the payoff is the tour de force that is the title story at the end. ""Poachers"" is a memorable little novella that will leave readers looking forward to Franklin's novel."
3,Wishful thinking,"My review is titled 'wishful thinking' because I had hoped to delve into family Cherokee ancestry. Even if I am to find an ancestor who is registered in the Dawes Roll, there is little to no explanation of the various columns that follow that name. There is probably some obscure printed guide that will explain what I am looking at. The spiral bound, paper back book arrived in a white paper envelope. On both sides of the book there was a piece of corrugated card board. That cardboard's dimensions weren't as wide or long as the book. When I opened the envelope I was, and am, upset that one corner of the book is all bent. The 'protective' card board was bent, also. Was this the fault of rough handling during shipment? Yes. I am sure it wasn't packed that way. Could it have been better packaged? You better believe it could have."
4,Tuckwell Does a Great One on This Album,"While in most instances I do not care for Tuckwell's style of playing, I must say that after hearing him play the Franz Strauss Concerto I was quite impressed. He adds delicate phrasing to the little-known concerto and it (out of the few cd publications of this piece) is the best recording I have heard of the work. I would advise any horn admirer to purchase this one."

5,THE TRUE POKER STORY,tnIn my opinion Uncle billy truly steals the scene. It was true inspiration to me. I couldnt wait tot see how it ended . I recommend it to anyone
4,Very good!,"I've been enjoying this book for the three years while going to Seminary and in my home Bible classes. Very practical and handy book. NASB, of course, could be even better as a parallel text, but NKJ sometimes suggest an even better flow of thought. Too bad, it does not have a Greek-English dictionary in the end. Some grammatical notations above the words might have been of some help as well."
3,Surprisingly good,"I bought this book for my daughter (an advanced 10-year-old reader) because it was required reading. I was without any books of my own one day with a long wait, so I picked it up and started reading. It was a surprisingly good read.Many of the books on the reading list were overly simple for her, but I thought this one, while not complex in writing style, was a thought invoking book. It was very realistic and would be a good topic of discussion for classes at my daughter's age-level.It's really good to see kids' books that are not all about ""Paris Hilton""-esque main characters. There are other real issues going on with our kids that deserve attention while not being overly serious about them and this book does a great job!"
4,Very high quality watch!,"This is a finely-crafted watch that will impress. No need to repeat what's been said by other reviews. Just one note: the face on thie watch is a darker blue than the picture shows; it's a deep navy blue/steel blue, which is very classy."
2,Scratch magnet,"It's a very nice watch and I've been using it for more than 3 years now. I bought it from Kohls when they had a 30% coupon, so I got it for around $200 after all the discounts and cash backs. It has been running perfectly ever since. The blue dial is darker than pictured and is almost black, but looks great.Now the problem. It's a scratch magnet. The dial window is supposed to be a hardened mineral, but it looks like acrylic after 3 years of use. It has lot of scratches all over it. May be I use it rough, but my 4 year old Skagen that cost me $50 does not have even a single scratch on the glass! For a $300 watch, I would expect a sapphire window or at least a harder material.2 stars for the movement. -3 for the materials."
5,Fantastic watch,"Bought the watch from sivermoon jewelry, fast delivery.This watch is so beautifully designed, with solid stainless steel bracelet. Looks like a very expensive watch. I have not seen any other watches that as beautiful as this one. Ecodrive technology that doesnt require change of battery, perpetual calender, what more do you want?"
1,Get the hell out of there!!,"Call me old fashioned, but this movie reminded me of an old adage about beating a rug. ""The stubborn stains remain in the middle."" No matter how hard you beat it, there still seems to be that nasty stain in the middle, in this instance its the middle of our country, the Heartland, the great (?) Midwest, where minds are small and bigots are big.Perhaps it is because I live on the West Coast, but I found this film to be difficult to follow and irrelevant. Never have I seen a gay and Lesbian themed film with so many unattractive, useless and ineffectual individuals. People! Pack up your bags and get the hell out of there!! Do not waste your money or time on this useless endeavor."
4,thought provoking,"could not believe that such small mindedness still exsisted, but so much for small town anywhere not just america, i certainly hope things have changed. A well put together documentry."
4,Flexible USB Adapter,Works just fine. Gets the usb device out of the way lessening chance it will break off. Worth the money.
5,handy gadget,This adapter makes it possible to use more than one usb port on my laptop where the ports are too close together to plug in two devices. I find it very useful.
2,Disappointed,"Purchased a flex angle USB connector and a fixed 90 degree angle USB, to fit tight spaces. BOTH of them would not work correctly. I have a Toshiba laptop as my main PC, and a 3-monitor setup (including the laptop monitor) The ONLY change was the insertion of the right-angle connector to the docking station. On the fixed connector, I lost both external monitors; on the flex connector I lost the Toshiba monitor. On both, I got various ""could not load/find""... messages. Everything works fine without the added connector. Hard to figure why a simple pass-through would screw things up."
4,Heal Your Body by Louise L. Hay,"I really enjoy the Book ""Heal Your Body"" by Louise Hay because it gives you a lot of valuable insite in what causes some aches and pains we experience in life. I especially like the Loving Statement at the end of the book, I am trying to memorize it, to help me use it on a daily basis."
5,A life saver when nothing else worked!,"I absolutely love this book! Seeing the relationship between our thoughts and how they affect our body is simply amazing---and true. I have been doing a lot of energy & body work to heal myself from a 'terminal' disease--the doctors have been amazed that I am still walking around & active. I still have work to do, but honestly, without the help of Louise Hay's books & some others, I would not be alive today!"
2,"Just a chapter taken from ""You Can Heal Your Life""","I did not realize that this book was just a section of ""You Can Heal Your Life"".I wish I could return them, but it's too late....they are brand new....Anybody want to buy them?? They are handy for a quick reference of the body part /disease connection."
4,Hardcopy vs kindle,Great little book however I would suggest the hardcopy as apposed to a ebook version simply because it would be easier to flick through the book to find the symptom you're looking for rather than type.
5,Heal Your Body,Heal Your Body by Louise Hay is a wonderful book. It was in great condition and did not take long to get. I have read this book several times and give it away after reading it just to buy it again and again.
1,out of control,This game sucks it is so difficult to control the character that they have to train you just how to control the way oni walks. what kind of [...] is that maybe others like that but I for one want to start the game not spend two hours in training rooms figuring out how to move that is crazy. I gave up after two hours of training and gave it back to my friend thank goodness I didn't waste money on this.
3,ONI YOU,"When I first popped in this game and started to play I found it to be extremely frustrating, the controls were all out of wack. As I played on I found the game to be excitng with a great story line, and the controls were bcoming more familiar. Yet as I came into the more difficult levels the controls were again frustrating as hell. My advice... RENT IT!!! It's a great game don't get me wrong. However, I believe that many people will be done with it after the first week."
4,Oni,"Oni is such a class game, although the Graphics are a bit [plain] looking but the gameplay is awsome, the Story is class also and so is the plot. I don't usually like PC gaming i usually prefer Consoles. I don't like the PS2 cause i think its a bit over rated just cause its made by sony doesn't mean its the most excellent console in the world but if your into Third Person, Shooters, hand to hand combat games or Anime you'll enjoy this game it kept me going i could play it all night and not get sick of it."
5,cleansing the blood,"I was told by my NATURE PATH that this tea is BEST for me since I have a YEAST problem. This tea is a BLOOD CLEANSER so I believe it would be good for all and if I have my information correct the PAU D'ARCO is the only tree in the RAIN FOREST that does not get FUNGUS hence good for CANDIDA YEAST. You might want to check this information. This tea is soothing and has a very different flavor, and I find it relaxing I do so enjoy the taste I also believe that knowing it is good for my BLOOD is another reason why I enjoy this tea so much. The price was excellent and the product arrived on time and packaged well I would recommend this product HIGHLY"
2,no win for Hamish one more time,"I keep coming back to M.C. Beaton, then am put off by the fact that she NEVER lets her characters win. As I'm not into light fiction for postmodern angst, I'm going to give even dear old Hamish a pass from here on. The story was the usual. Interchangeable with previous tales. I actually liked the new love interest. But the ending. Whooh! Way lame."
5,Don't be fooled by appearances,"When I first looked at this self-published book, I was somewhat dissapointed. It looks kind of like really thick term paper; typed, double-spaced, etc. But on reading this, I found it contains a wealth of information on covering your assets. As Bill says, ""CYA doesn't mean 'Call Your Attourney'"".In this book, Attorney Bill Bronchick gives a good overview of various trusts and business entities for individuals, professionals, and small business owners to avoid lawsuits and lessen their impact if you do get sued.I have used Bronchick's materials to form my own corporation and put my real estate holdings in trust. This book is an excellent place to start."
2,product didn't work but the vendor did,The easy seat appeared to be built well but it did not fit my physical requirements. The vendor was most helpful when we return the item. I Would work with them again.
2,A Celtic Death March,"I have always enjoyed Morgan Llwelyn's books until I read The Last Prince of Ireland. I'm not sure if I didn't like the book because I wanted the outcome to be different (unfortunately, the title was a dead give-away) or if I truly did not like the book.This book feels like 280 pages of a Celtic Bataan Death March. The Prince and his family/friends/companions travel the length and breadth of Ireland harrassed on all sides by not only the English, but his own people. It was written as a testimony to resilience in the face of starvation, exhaustion, betrayal and hopelessness. Unfortunately, it simply felt like a very long slog - both for both Llelyn's characters and the reader."
4,Melancholic Sciascia,"I have grown to love and respect Sciascia above all the other modern writers of political and social issues in modern Italy. His writing is absolutely mesmerizing (in Italian) and this translation makes a good job in transposing what is clearly a very difficult prose to transpose intact.As always with Sciascia, the themes are universal: death penalty, corruption, terrorism of state, decadent society.These are not among Sciascia's must-read works (look at ""The Day of the Owl"" and ""To Each his Own"" for that), but they express values and a vision of the tragedy in human nature that are typical Sciascia, albeit maybe a little more bitter, written, as they are, so close to his death.In particular I found ""Open Doors"" a beautifully written reflection on the meaning of justice and a harsh comdenation of the practice of capital punishment.I wish the almost universal love of everything Italian would extend to these lesser known gems of our contribution to the progress of the world."
2,"Great Book, But DO NOT BUY ""Creating Money"" audio tapes","This book is a great ""how to"" on visualization and spiritual wealth building. Skip pages 140 through 195 and you should be ok. Now to my reason on giving this book a 2 star rating: there are several Audio programs offered at the end of this book with the same title as this book. DO NOT buy any of them, this book has all the information you need to know about manifesting and wealth building; those tapes are an absolute waste.Buy this book, relax in a silent room, read it slowly and follow the meditation techniques, it will help. You are the creater and the created, having said that, you can have whatever you want and this book will show you how."
3,Too academic for me,I've always been fascinated with what being famous does to a person's life but there are surprisingly few intelligent books on the subject. This one comes sorta close but the guy's an economics professor so everything is seen through that lens. There are some really engaging ideas here but overall it was pretty dense reading and kinda dull.
3,"WITTY, SLAM-BANG DIALOGUE BETWEEN TWO SCREEN GEMS","John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara - I don't believe there's ever been another screen couple who can make the verbal, and romantic, sparks fly the way they do. Of all the movies I've owned over 18 years ofcollecting, none makes me laugh-out-loud as much as this one, even on repeated viewings. The dialogue crackles with testy good-humor, and the cast of supporting characters (Chill Wills, Edgar Buchanan) adds immensely to the fun. Sour note - this film absolutely screams out for a letterboxed or enhanced for 16:9 widescreen version. There are WAY TOO MANY characters missing in the poor pan and scan framing, ""barely there"" profile shots, characters talking to an off-screen presence. Also, the extremely poor DVD quality actually detracts from enjoyment of this fun film. It looks like a 3rd or 4th generation tape transfer. A sad way to treat such a popular film. Summary: Content - 5 stars, transfer quality - 1 star."
1,Poor print leading to lousy transfer to DVD,"McLintock is a great comedy/western; the casting is perfect and the script intelligent and witty. However, Good Times Video treated this excellent movie with tremendous disrespect and cheated buyers of this DVD badly. The ancient Greek saying of""caveat emptor"" or ""let the buyer beware"" fits well here.Anytime you see that the DVD comes from Good Times Video I highly recommend that you pass purchasing that item. Hopefully a REAL version of McLintock will be released by John Wayne's estate soon. This movie was not one of John Wayne's favorites and was released late for being such a good movie. Hopefully this had nothing to do with the estate of Mr. Wayne in releasing a crisp (and letter box) version."
1,Terrible film transfer!,"I agree with the previous reviewer, this absolutely has to be the worst transfer I've ever seen. The picture goes out of focus several times during the film. It was done from a bad print in the first place. I love the movie itself, but don't waste your money on this dvd version.... you WON'T be happy if you do."
1,Who butchered this great movie?,Goodtimes video has butchered this great movie. Sometimes the person talking is not in focus or even on the screen. Some scenes are missing. I can't take it back for mine was a gift. Make sure you buy the version authorized by the Wayne estate if you want the real movie with all of the scenes included. I have that copy on VHS. Sorry to say I have not yet found it on DVD.
4,Superlative movie-poor quality transfer to DVD,"One of my all time favorite movies. Was hoping it would come out on DVD. However, very poor transfer to DVD. Quite possibly the poorest quality DVD I have ever seen. I realize that I might just have received a bad one, buyer beware."
1,this 2002 version is horrible quality,"The video looks like a very very bad transfer from video tape to DVD. This is not the version of this movie you want to buy, ever. It's not worth $1 even."
3,Great Movie; lousy video quality,"This is one of my favorite movies, hey, it's a John Wayne flick. Lots of fun, action, and the standard brawl scene. Unfortunately, the video quality is the worst I've seen on a DVD... muddy color, blurry, grainy. I'm not sure if the film was shot widescreen or not, but this DVD is not widescreen. If a new edition came out with the problems corrected, I'd rebuy it. The lack of technical quality gets in the way of the enjoyment of the movie. Were it not for the video quality problems, I'd give it 5 stars."
1,McLintock,Great Movie but DO NOT BUY this poorly made copy from Hong Kong/Taiwan. Our bought VHS tape has better picture quality than this DVD version.
1,Do not buy this version!,"If you love McLintock! as much as I do, you WON'T buy this version from Good Times Video. The overall quality (picture, focus, screen ratios, etc.) is absolutely awful -- this goes for both their VHS and DVD versions. If I could give it a half star I would.Apparently, the John Wayne Estate or his family lost control of either the reproduction or marketing rights to McLintock! some years ago, and Good Times took some Scotch brand tape, staples and chewing gum and patched together this awful copy.The good news is that John Wayne's family authorized a VHS version made from the original master footage, which is excellent. Look for an orange box with the Wayne family authorization printed on the front. Let's hope The Duke's family will work to produce an authorized DVD of McLintock as well."
3,"People, People, People......","I have to say I was very disappointed that this was the pirated version of ""McLintock"" and not the original, that was used for the DVD release. This is my favorite John Wayne movie. It is so obvious that scenes and lines are missing. I wish they would have used the legal copy, it would have been much better. With that said....""McLintock"" is a hilarious look into a rich cattleman's life. Maureen O'Hara plays his wife and she is perfect. When I was younger, I always wanted to be like Mrs. McLintock, so brave and strong. Patrick Wayne is wonderful as a hired hand. There is a fight scene at a clay pit, that will have you rolling on the floor, laughing. The line by John Wayne, ""I'm not going to hit you, I'm not going to hit you, the He** I'm not!"", it's perfect. There are two scenes with spanking involving grown women that you just have to see to believe."
1,Buyer Beware,This is a horrible copy of the original. The color is bad throughout the movie. There are lines in the picture like you would see if you were watching an old home movie. The widescreen version is much better than this one.
2,"Great fun, POOR quality DVD","Couldn't wait to get this movie. We bought it on DVD thinking it would be of higher quality. WRONG! This movie is so poorly transfered it made me mad just to watch it. It needs to be offered in letterbox, sometimes all you see is the back of someones head and the person who is talking isn't even on the screen. Then the brightness goes up and down, and the picture gets fuzzy. If I had released this copy to the public I would be thourghly embarressed. I feel cheated out of my money and the fun of watching this movie. If another version is offered with letterbox and MUCH better quaility, I would buy it and throw this version in the trash. It has set a new standard in our house, rent the DVD first and check the quality, then buy."
5,McLintock,Love this movie. I consider this to be one of John Wayne's finest movies. This is entertainment at its finest. They don't make movies like this any more. I would recommend this all.
4,"Yes and No, Buy and No Buy","I must agree with both of the comments made by these two!I like Michael Colyar, I think he is but this DVD wasn't all that, in other comedy series he is very funny, his way of presenting comedy is out of this world, but in this dvd he wasn't really doing that if you know what i mean.If you purchase this DVD you will have a laugh but the Michael Colyar edge of comedy style is missing or he didn't show enough of!"
1,"Cute, but Watch out for Paint Flakes!","My husband and I were very excited to receive this as a gift off of our baby registry. As we were putting the liners in the baskets and placing them in the changing table, we noticed white paint flakes and white paint powder all over our hands, the changing table, and the carpet.We immediately sent these back, as we did not want paint flakes and dust floating around in our daughter's room."
2,Canvas Totes are the Way to Go,"I received a set of these for my shower. At first, they seemed ok, but after a short time of handling them they began to wear very easily. The paint does chip and the wicker becomes brittle and cracks. I have found pieces of the wicker (as do my 2 year old twins) around the house constantly. I would highly suggest finding canvas totes that work instead. Much safer than these baskets!"
4,BIG,These are really cute. They are very big. Too big that they wouldn't fit on the shelves I wanted them on. I had to return them. If you have a deep wide spot to put them you will love them. I found this smaller & love it.
5,Doesn't take up a lot of space!,"I wanted to upgrade from a 15"" to a 17"" monitor however I have a really small desk and most of the standard 17"" monitors would be too big. I couldn't afford a flat screen so this Philips 17"" monitor is perfect. It doesn't take up a lot of space and it didn't cost a lot either. Amazon customer support people answered all my questions too!"
1,Misleading description from the publisher,"Full of wonderful verbal cotton candy, this book seems to promise some insights into the role of technology in architecture. Instead we get shallow commentary scribbled down at various airports and other points around the world. If you are interested in learning more about how information technology will shape architecture and urban spaces I recommend you start somewhere else."
1,Apollo 18,"I don't see yet the items I bought, because they don't arrived to me. What is happening? Please, review your items sending to me."
3,Ok scary NOT,It was another hyped movie that showed all the good stuff in the previews. This was a movie that should be rented so it goes away and you never have to see it again. Was not scary and the scary part was they actually had it on the big screen first.
2,Too much far-fetched big conspiracy stuff...,"A movie like this is not compelling because of the all-too-often repeated storyline of an all-knowing government who knows all about the dangers and dead Russians but sent the men to the moon anyway. This is a real ""9-11 Thruther"" type scenario which falls apart as soon as you sweat a few first order logistical or historical details. My main objection to this type of movie is that it gives birth to the most meaningless and false tripe when the actual history is incredibly compelling."
2,The Blair Witch Project Goes To Space,"This movie left me feeling like I'd been conned out of the cost of an Amazoid rental. While watching, I had feelings of ""bad-movie-deja-vu""...like I'd felt this compulsion before. It was an irrepressible impulse to grab the remote and permanently pause this bit of filmic three-card Monte. Then it hit me---this was basically the Blair Witch Project on the moon! Meh...I hated the Blair Witch Project."
3,Worth the Red Box price ... but no more than that ...,"The Blair Witch Project goes to the moon ... could have been better ... could have been worse ... you can't go in to it expecting too much when they tell you it's made up of footage that was ""recovered"" and ""uploaded"" to the ""internet"""
1,Lame movie,"Watched this movie at a friends house. Oh my it was stupid. Found footage, yeah right. Glad I didn't pay to see this trash.Moon rocks are the attacking aliens.... really stupid."
1,This movie is terrible,The rocks are alive...stupid. Don't waste your time on this...even if it is free.There is nothing interesting about the movie
1,Worse movie of my lifetime,"This is the most terrible, rotten, stupidist movie I have ever seen. This has replaced my most worst movie on my list. Using old Apollo films then having the stupid idea of secret Apollo mission which means nothing is not even something a 5th grader would think of. The worst thing is what I payed for it. Another bad thing is making it sound like another good movie like Apollo 13. Apollo 13 was very good and accurate. Dirty trick to make this sound like another good Apollo movie. Made me sick........."
3,nitemares,"do not, i repete, do not watch this film before going to bed.you will spend the nite, if luckey, trying to talk folks out of killing you.luckily i tried talking them out of it, by demanding that i be aloud to write a will.on one dream. and telling the folks id infecy them if tried.thankfully i woke up on those ocasions to wiz.thank god for beer!"
1,Moon's rocks are the monsters!,"So stupid, one of the weird movie ever, shacking camera all the way, the story is long very long before to get to the rocks eaters (witch is unbelievably stupid), so at the end, it s only the last 20mn that you know that the moon's rock are the devil, and they do not have even the shape of a monster, they are still rocks....I DO NOT RECOMMAND THIS MOVIE !!"
1,Disappointing at best,"Good sf movies are few and far between. So are horror movies. Good horror sf movies are even more rare. Sorry but Apollo 18 was not a good sf or horror for me.Spoiler:The basic theme seems sound: There was a mission after 17 which went to the moon and discovered Russian cosmonauts had been there as well as a ""menace"" which had killed the Russians and contaminated one of our astronauts. This we know from secret film which was edited to make the movie.Supposedly degraded film and shaking the camera do not make a good horror movie or sf movie. This film is a big bust so don't waste your money or your time. The trailer was better than the movie."
2,Boring..... ZZZzzzZZZzzz,"Some cool scenes but just a bunch of weird stuff not connected to one another and way to many issues with the movie.I get the idea and what they were going for, but they failed to make a movie, rather it's just like watching youtube video(s) out of order."
4,Good enough,IT was like most people said... part blair witch part conspiracey and part apollo 13.Compared to the other crappy movies in 2011 this was at least as good.
2,"It's okay.... ""Spoiler alert""","The movie was short, nothing gets resolved...basically a rock that turns into a spider alien thing. Everyone dies in the end and while it did keep my interest, that was only because I thought I would find out what was happening at the end."
3,Apollo 18,"Saw this movie last weekend. This type of movie I really do not care for however, it was better than both ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Cloverfield"". I guess if you had to rename the movie because of the TS nature in it. You could always rename it ""Space Crabs""."
2,What did I just watch?,"Shaky camera , poor actors , and budget special effects.I don't think anyone is trying anymore to make good horror movies. Watch Moon if you want quality movie. One dollar from redbox deserves two stars"
3,Really big plot hole,"I can accept the ""found footage"" style cinematography. The plot is is also new and contrary to most current Lunar Landing conspiracy theories out there so at least it's not the same old. ""Capricorn One"" did that already in 1978. My problem with the movie comes as the very end. Spoiler alert: Stop reading this if you plan on watching the movie.The orbiter and the lander both did not make it back. Everyone were killed. So how did NASA get the video tapes back on Earth? Apollo 19? OMG! Are they going to make a sequel?"
2,should been better,"Great premise for a movie, that never got any traction. Too jumpy to let a story develop, so the ""footage"" style never hit home. I'm a big sci-fi fan, but this?...pass"
2,Apollo 18 shouldn't have happened,"I usually enjoy movies with a space theme, and I love seeing scenes with the moon, but this story was a bit hard to follow beyond the basic theme as something bad was up there and very hard to watch. The scenes were deliberately poor quality and shaky. This is one space movie I will not be watching again."
2,Has some really excellent parts,"This review is based on the audio CD that I have just finished listening to. Someone needs to tell the author that at times the cartoon is just that a cartoon. He seems to feel that it is an unrelenting engine of social reform exposing the ills of today's society....well, sure it is a very insightful and biting satire that is one of the few ""must see"" programs on tv today. But an engine of social reform...DOAH!"
2,Small Hamper,"I bought this for my main bathroom, and was disapponted as it is chipping all over, and will not last more than 1 year. Will replace with a large plastic hamper which gives more depth but takes up the same amount of space. Looks nice if the paint did not chip and pieces of wicker were not falling off as well."
3,A Danish Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf,"This is a subtitled Danish story of adults deeply scarred by child abuse. It is also about how powerful people can maintain a secret, even one that everyone knows. The movie often reminded me of how politicians are adept at coverup. The movie is difficult because the camera work is so jumpy you'd think it was done by strapping a webcam to a kangaroo. I would imagine many people would tune out early unwilling to put up with that. The male characters are as sharply drawn as any in film, however, I had great trouble telling the female characters apart. It is not at all like a typical Hollywood film where you understand every word of dialog and its significance, and you get every joke. There is lots to offend anyone the least prudish in any sense. The tobacco and alcohol ""pornography"" bothered be more than the nudity and suggestions of sexual deviance and racism. It a meaty film, not a particularly feel good film."
5,Amazing,This is a film in a class of it's own.Can't compare it with anything I have ever seen.Five stares is a modest rating. You wont be disappointed
5,Brilliant!,"Christian is about to reveal a big secret. A secret that he has been terrified to reveal. He's on his way to his fathers 60th birthday. His father tells him that he'd like to hear a speech from his son during the birthday. But what he doesn't know is that Christian has a truly unforgettable story to tell.""Festen (The Celebration)"" is a powerful movie. I understand how much pressure the main character must have had when he had his speech during the party. And how much emotions poured out when he did that. What is so shocking with the movie is that there is secret being told. A secret that hardly no one knew a the party. And how brave Christian was when he revealed the big secret.The movie was shot using the rules of Dogma. No lighting, no make up, hardly nothing. Just a hand held camera focusing on the actors.A brilliant movie made by some people in Denmark. :o)"
1,Don't waste your money on this -- it is free in Bangkok,"That's right. At any Skytrain station this map is free. So, unless you need the map before you get there, don't buy it here. Get it free in Thailand."
3,Sixty Years In Southern California,"I'm impressed that this otherwise hard-to-find book is being made available by Forgotten Books. This reprint ""has been generated by a scan of the original,"" which in theory is an excellent way to maintain the flavor of the time period. HOWEVER, the scanning job they did for this particular book could be better in my opinion. It looks more like a photocopy than what we think of today as a ""scan."" The text is readable, despite being light. But the photos are a real disappointment and definitely look like bad photocopies rather than scanned photos. Someone at Forgotten Books should be doing more quality control. This being said, if you were to photocopy the 700 page original yourself, it would probably cost more and not be bound in book form. So if you can live with the photocopy look, the Forgotten Books edition is an affordable way to own this book."
5,Shifrin is spectacular!,This CD is one of the better recordings of the Mozart and Brahms Clarinet Quintets that I have heard. Shifrin is one of the most amazing clarinetists of our time today. He combines clarity of sound with true artistic ability. His interpretation of the Brahms is second to none. To have this great of a performer combined with the Emerson String Quartet is the making of an excellent recording that I highly recommend. You will treasure this recording for years to come!
5,One of the Best Brahms and Mozart Clarinet Quintet,"This CD is simply wonderful!I bought thinking about the sensational Quintet of Brahms, which I consider one of the best songs in the history of art.The performance by the Emerson is great!Clarity, dynamics, lyricism, it all together!I strongly recommend"
4,Great Bags!,I ordered these bags in black and red. They are for my dance school and I got them embroidery with our schools logo they look great! Perfect for a dancer! Everyone Loves them! Very Roomy!
1,Zipper broke,"I've had this bag just under three months and started having issues with the zipper for the past month or so. Today the zipper completely broke. I was happy with this bag till these zipper issues, now sadly I feel like I just threw money away."
3,Better than Bad Mojo Jojo but still not great,"This game doesn't really capture the spirit of feisty Powerpuff Girl Buttercup or the show. You die if you land in a pool of water, Buttercup has limited ammunition for her laser vision, and she doesn't fly for very long(so unlike the cartoon). Each level looks nearly the same as every other part of the same level, making it hard to find navigate. Still, this game is better than Bad Mojo Jojo. In Paint the Townsvile Green's favor the characters, from Buttercup to villains, look pretty good. There is more of an emphasis on fighting, and it's a lot harder to get lost than in Bad Mojo Jojo. I, a fan of those doll-like Powerpuff Girls, enjoyed it, but perhaps the average game player wouldn't."
4,pure hell on earth,"if you don't know about Immortal by this time, you have either been living on an island for the past 20 years or simply are not a fan of black metal. Pure Holocaust is just that...pure hellish metal torment. One of the fastest black metal records ever recorded by one of the fastest bands of the genre. Not much diversity here as on their later albums, but most fiends will agree, all of their albums are worthy."
2,Outdated but somewhat useful,"Having just finished a course on ""Understanding Other Cultures"" where this book was one of the required texts, and finding the book sadly lacking in many areas, I wanted to warn future purchasers.This book is out of date. Badly. It's basically pre-Internet in the tools you are asked to bring to bear in the projects used to understand other cultures. Granted, you can work around them by applying the principles behind the different methods, but that means you could rip out 40 pages or so and not miss them.No demographics. No Google Maps. No GPS. No digital - anything.So if you are happy with your Atari game system, you will enjoy this book. On the other had, if you are toting a smartphone or using the internet at all, this will seem like card catalog remembrance days at the school library. What's a card catalog? Go ask someone over 50."
4,what talent,It is great to hear the real Rob - love him with Huey and the boys - but this lets him shine
2,Many other options; however nice background noise,"I'm a long time game master and am always looking for good background music to set the tone for an event or situation presented in my games. I found Legends of Kitholan Vol. 1 to be a good background but its not significant enough for me to justify a high rating. There's no comparing this sound track to Midnight Syndicate; Legends of Kitholan is more of a generic feel for dungeon crawling. I would recommend this sound track to a younger audience. In the end, I didn't find anything new on this sound track, nor was I impressed with the price for what you get. If your going to buy this sound track be sure to download the MP3 album to save what money you can."
4,"Down the Garden Path, A Thatched Roof, Village in a Valley","I love this series of books by Beverley Nichols...I enjoy so much his writing style and the fact that he's just a ""little"" irreverent...I love his enthusiasm for his garden...He seems to have lived in a wonderful world of his own...Reading about it 70 years later is such a gift...Kelly Burgess."
1,Routine,"To paraphrase samuel Johnson, what's good about this album isn't original, and what's proginal isn't good."
1,"This is what's wrong with ""new country""","Mediocre voice, trite lyrics. Country music has devolved into bad pop music with a fiddle. And Rodney Atkins is the epitome."
5,Awesome,I have heard a couple of his songs on the local country station and never really paid attention to who was singing the catchy songs. My boyfriend got us tickets to his concert and I became an instant fan. He has great stage presence and his songs are great. Needless to say I can add this cd to my collection.
4,if you're gonna listen,"To be honest, I am new to the whole country music scene. From my standpoint this is a great CD. I love the melodies that Rodney chooses for his songs. My least favorite song is ""What I love about the South"" simply because I hate the twang in it. I love ""Come on in boy (cleaning this gun)"", ""If You're Going through Hell"" and ""Watching you.""Even with the bit of twang, it is still a good country rock album that deserves a listen... even to those who do not consider themselves ""die-hard"" country fans."
3,Oddly drying,"I live in the NE and have fine hair. I bought this shampoo thinking that it would hydrate my hair during the winter without weighing it down. It certainly left me with lots of body, but my hair looks like I just used a clarifying shampoo. It's more dried out than when I use my regular shampoo (Fekai's Glossing Shampoo). I love the Carthame mask, so I'm quite surprised. Maybe it will be OK in the summer, when my roots get oily, but for the winter this will not work for me."
2,Konka DVD Player,Drive motor noise is unacceptable. I returned my unit. I didn't bother to find out whether this is a model problem or a unit problem.
3,The dvd menu would make an excellent screensaver,"When you put this movie into your dvd player, a nice menu appears with a very beautiful picture of the frozen girl, with big wide open eyes, and with hauntingly beautiful music playing in the background. If you have ever seen the movie Solaris, the music at the end of the movie Solaris is a bit similar to the music in Freeze Me.I would love to have the menu as a screensaver on my computer.As for the movie itself, I did not like it that much. I hate the way the female acts weak and submissive. The one police authoritative figure in the movie seems weak, and even the girl's boyfriend is weak.I did enjoy the 3 scenes where she murders her 3 tormentors, and the one scene where she has an interesting conversation with them as they laid dead in the freezer. She gives them a ""I got you Now"" speech."
3,Smack Down! 2: Know Your Role,"My 12 yr. old son, a die hard wrestling fan, begged me to purchase this game for him. I'm glad I did, he LOVES it. He has just about every wrestling game that has come out. According to him, the game is a lot of fun."
3,"""THE THRILLS WONT LAST LONG""","The first time i played the game i was going to give it a five star rating.Then after a week i found myself getting bored with the game.I sometimes find myself playing with my friends now and thats it.Even after I created a wrestler i found myself getting bored even before i unlocked all of the characters.This game is somewhat a little fun,especially the hell in a cell match,tlc match,and hardcore tornado tag.As said before the game is a little fun but the thrills wont last forever."
5,LAY THE SMACKDOWN 2 ON ALL THE OTHER GAMES!!!!,Smackdown 2 is the most AMAZIN game i have ever played and thats something.I am an absolute wrestling addict.I never miss a WWF event or TV show.And i have bought every wrestling game i know of and this is the best#!!!!!!Top Dog In The Gaming World....????!!!!!!
1,Poor Quality Tape Recording,Do not waste your money on this very bad copy of this film. We studied this in school years ago. This copy has not only been edited but the image quality is very poor. You can try to help the image quality by lowering the contrast control on your TV.
3,Portland House Edition vs. Calla,"**Disclaimer: This is not a review of the Calla edition only the Portland House one I received through this listing. I have no experience or knowledge of the Calla edition.**Lovers of Kay Nielsen be wary of the Portland House edition of The Twelve Dancing Princesses. The black and white illustrations are beautiful, but the color reproductions are not in their correct text placing throughout the book. They are stuck together 3-5 at a time in various places in the stories e.g. An illustration ""Felicia listens to the hen's story"" pairs with the text on page 62, yet is found next to page 104 in Rosanie (a completely different tale). I also found the color reproductions wanting; they were a bit blurry.All in all, if you want your illustrations paired with your text (and who doesn't?) this edition is not for you."
2,"Once more in unison: ""mine broke with no warning""","Bought this refurbished from the Epson website. It worked fine for about a year (light use), then whammo, one fine morning the pulley mechanism failed. A well conceived device but poorly manufactured."
5,Great scanner,"I have owned mine for several years and am pleased with it. It's still hard to believe that you can get this kind of quality for the price - I believe it's cheaper now than when I bought mine. I scan everything from book pages, B&W and color prints, and negatives, to transparencies, and it does a great job."
1,"Used to be great, but now an anchor....","I used this scanner for over two years without as much as a hickup, it was much better than the huge HP flatbed I had before. Then I reimaged my HD, reloaded XP (the same I had before)and updated to SP2 from the microsoft website. The packaged software ""Epson Scan"" no longer functions. I scan using the copy utility but nothing else. Their support site led me through the same routine many times, removing, re-installing, direct connect over and over again. Kicked to the curb, craziness. I just can't believe there are no fixes out on the web for this...."
5,Great deal- 2 of the best seasons of Miami Vice for 1 price,"I bought this set with a Best-Buy gift card it was worth it. I was too young to watch the show when it premiered in 1984. But later on I watched reruns of the show and I was hooked. I feel that seasons 1 and 2 were the best of the show's 5-year run. My favorite episode is the 2nd season opener ""Prodigal Son"" mostly because shots of the Twin Towers was featured. I would purchase the 3rd season of Vice as well. But not the last 2 seasons 1987-1988, 1988-1989."
3,From the Frying Pan Into the Fire,"One cannot help but be moved by this personal account of an Italian priest's evolution into a devotee of the India guru, Sathya Baba. Not surprisingly, Mazzoleni's growing loyalty to Sai Baba resulted in his excommunication from the Catholic Church. His dilemmas are authentic; his soul searching is intense.Watching him embrace Eastern thought is inspiring and fascinating.One can only wonder what this sincere cleric's response has been to the current torrent of print and media articles classifying Sai Baba as a corrupt pedophile and trickster."
2,Not the Ultimate Collection,"Yikes! What have they done with modern Spidey cartoons? The four ""modern"" animated Spidey eps on this disc are terrible. They are paced so quickly that my head spun when watching it. The stories are not so bad but they try to squeeze so much into them that it is pure sensory overload. Slow it down guys and tell the story with confidence, not speed.This contrast is most evident when viewing the original Spidey cartoon from the 1960's, which, while technically inferior in animation, had so much more character, a better theme song, interesting angles and perspectives and those great deep ink colors reminiscent of a real comic book. I'd buy all of the original Spidey cartoons from the 60's on DVD but not this 90's stuff. Bring back the classic Spidey cartoons!"
1,Horrible DVD's,I have a lot of problems with the dvd's of this cartoon. I like the cartoon but these 3 problems make these dvd's look like crap!1.These are not boxsets like the region 2 dvd's. This would not be a problem but dvd's have region coding unlike VHS.2.The dvd's only 3 or 4 episodes plus one from the 1960's cartoon which sucks.3.Buena Vista Home Entertainment(the ones who makee the dvd's) have not announced that their going to make boxsets like the region 2 dvds.Overall: Don't buy these dvds they suck. Me and my grandma like the series and we watch it on the internet but the problem about that is that it has to load. I wish Buena Vista Home Entertainment would make boxsets like the region 2 dvd's!!!!!!!!!!
1,"This is written like a story, not a textbook","I understand that Knight wrote this in a very pedagogical manner, but this book confuses the hell out of me. He goes back and forth with references within the book, takes forever to describe a simple concept, and describes the mathematical side of physics poorly. On top of that, the layout is very poor. The examples in the book are in small print (8 point, maybe max 9 point font?) and the explanation for them are usually one huge blob of words. The text is just not clear for those who are more on the math side of things. To be fair, if you don't like reading science textbooks and would rather read something that is laid out to the most obvious detail, this book might serve its purpose. If you have a choice, Giancoli's Physics is very good."
1,NOT impressed,"This book is ridiculous. The examples and explanations in the text do NOT even come CLOSE to preparing you for the homework problems in the back of the book. If those are what your instructor bases his exams off of, you're hosed. Personally, I don't understand how this book makes it into universities.I'm holding a 3.8 accumulative and I'm FAR beyond the calculus series in the math portion of my bachelors, into 300 level math. IMHO, in a 100 level class, one should be able to sit down, read the chapter, study it for a couple hours after reading it and have a pretty good grasp of everything in the chapter. With this book, that just isn't possible. You're going to have to hope you have a good teacher, and utilize that teacher and other resources to grasp what is going on."
4,Love it!,"I am thrilled with this purchase! I didn't want to have to use a chest strap heart rate monitor, but wanted to be able to have a better estimation of my calories burned and use my heart rate range to better focus my workouts. It's done exactly that for me! Occasionally I have to try a couple times before getting a reading from the finger sensors, which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars... but overall I am very satisfied. It's easy to use and understand, and I feel like it has increased the efficiency of my workouts a ton! I highly recommend this heart rate watch!"
4,Heart Rate Monitor Watch,Watch was just as described. I chose this watch because it was smaller and looked like a woman's watch. The heart rate monitor works good and I do not have to stop exercising to get a reading. I would recommend this product to woman looking for a heart rate monitor watch.
3,"First one didnt work, second one seems to be fine",So I bought one of these for my girl. The first one broke on the second day. It stopped taking the heart rate even after going through all of the trouble shooting steps I couldn't get it to work. I got a replacement through Amazon and she says she is not having any issues with this one and she loves it.
2,heart rate monitor,"The watch works well as a heart rate monitor, but is terribly inaccurate as a calorie counter."
2,Hard to change batteries,I tried to change the batteries and the screws warped so they could not be turned by the screwdriver. I went to a jeweler and they were able to change the batteries for me.
2,Unhappy with product,"I am very unhappy with this watch. I bought it specifically for the calorie counter and heart rate monitor. The heart rate monitor works sometimes when I am not working out and NEVER when I am working out. When I check the heart rate it will just kick back and show me what time it is. Yeah it says to wet your fingers and try again, lower your wrist below your heart, wait 3 minutes and try again...bla bla bla. When you're at your peak you want to know where your heart rate is. Not 3 minutes later after you are cooling down. I know that I burn at least 1,300-1,500 calories during my back to back spin/strength training class and my watch states that I burn less than 1 calorie per minute?? REALLY?? Come on!! I would really like my money back. I bought it because it was inexpensive and had decent reviews, but I guess you get what you pay for sometimes?? My spin instructor bought the same watch from Amazon and she is having the same exact issues. Guess it's not just me...."
2,Not Quite Acurate,"I love the idea, but unforunately, not quite right. I spent 2 days comparing the rate for the watch to my B/P monitor every hour and found that the watch was off by at least 10 beats too rapid, even just sitting at my computer. The only time they about matched was when I was laying down watching TV. My PCP also does not like these watches for just that reason. Too bad. I read the other reviews before I bought it, and thought it would be great. Use caution when using these watches."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS WATCH,"It simply doesn't work. It did a fine job of taking my heart rate for about three days, and then simply stopped working. The calorie counter never worked, but I didn't particularly care about that feature. I really just wanted to be able to reliably check my heart rate, and I didn't want to spend the money for a Polar heart rate monitor. The manual has VERY limited troubleshooting, and there is no help number or customer service number. Save your money."
5,Loved IT!,"I love this watch. It doesn't have or need any wires to hook to your shirt or chest. Just simply use 2 fingers to press the 2 buttons on the face of the watch. It has a lot more programs than I thought it would have. It has regular time with the day and the date in the face, heart rate, alarm, calorie counter, timer, dual, and CHR. It is great. I dont even use all of the programs. Actually, I wear the watch everyday, even when I am not working out."
5,"Oh, the Brutality","Anyone who knows anything about Heavy Metal knows that Pantera is one of the best bands there is... Pantera has been playing straight-up brutal metal for years and have never changed. Everybody knows this. You either love them or you hate them. All the songs are in the same style. Some would even say they all sound the same... If you love Brutal metal that will make you pets hide when you turn up the stereo, then check out any of these albums. Be prepared for Phil Anselmo's vocal, he has a voice like no other. Darrell's riffs are unparalled. Many of their songs have become anthems to Heavy Metal fans. Pantera is a mainstay in the metal world."
1,CD doesn't include the business plan,"The business plan in the book is a pretty good template to get you started, but it's an insult that the CD that comes with it doesn't have the business plan on it. So here I am at 3:45 AM typing it from scratch, using the CD as an all night coffee coaster."
3,wordy,I found it a bit wordy in places but having never read any other HG Wells it maybe just my impression.
4,Great Itch or Hot Spot Relief Spray,"This hydro-cortisone spray really helped relieve itching from hot spots, I was also able to dip a cotton swab in it, and swab the inside of itchy ears for my two cats with allergies. Certainly relieved the itching enough to diminish the scratching and chewing associated with the problems."
2,if only it didn't smell,Pros:I do think it soothed her itchingCons:smell... my cat didn't like the smell so she became more hesitant around use of the product.The smell wasn't really that bad. And I did use it some. But eventually I started to use something else that she didn't hide from
1,Concentration is suspect...sprayer in operable...,"This spray applicator works minimally if at all forcing the user to apply directly having to unscrew the bottle cap. The resulting waste factor makes for ""a very poor experience"" only further challenging the product itself who's chemical concentration appears suspect if not significantly dilluted. Convince me otherwise? Thanks."
2,Expect Brand Substitution,"I just received the product, and apparently the seller doesn't stick to the named brand. I received Excel Hydrocortisone spray with Aloe Vera. It probably doesn't matter, except that I thought I was purchasing one product and received another. I'm glad the dealership didn't take that approach on my most recent car purchase.Also, the product leaked all over the package. Not a lot of the product was lost, but having veterinary grade cortisone spray all over the packaging of my wife's prenatal vitamins was not what I expected."
1,Bottles opened received soggy box,Bottles opened during delivery. I received a soggy opened box. One bottle was empty the other had small amount still leaking out. Can't tell you if the product works or not. I can only assume the shipping box and the mail truck are not itching. Poor packaging for shipping.
3,"Good book, but not the best so far","I liked this book, but I did not find myself riveted as intently as some of the others I have read so far. This book is the slowest of the 5 I have read so far, but still good. I found myself reading through it just so I can move ahead without skipping a book."
1,"how about a zero star rating, guys?","This LaHaye guy is basically the modern-day equivalent of the old tent-revival preachers, except that he is pocketing millions instead of pocket change. His books do achieve one worthy thing, though: they actually make organized religion seem dumber than it already is. This one panders shamelessly to the pre-millenial panic crowd, and I'm sure a lot of them will stock up on copies of LaHaye's books along with the Spam and portable generators. Verdict: just another end-time huckster trying to make a few million bucks before the big nothing at the end of the century. A side note: since when did fundamentalists become so interested in computers, anyway?"
4,Contiued excellence,"Despite some negative comments here, I still believe these books are wonderful writing. Apollyon continues that, keeping the reader in suspense until the end and beyond."
3,Unabridged CD version,"Two reviews in one... what a bargain.First the book. This one sort of dragged. There were a number of exciting scenes, but a whole lot and I mean a WHOLE lot of phone calls and baby talk. I had to fast forward at times to get through it.Now the CD quality. I listen to a lot of books on CD because I'm not a very strong reader (big words confuse me). Typically they select someone with a good voice who can do a moderate number of characters/dialects. This one sounded like a children's puppet show. The voices were some extreme that they were either comical or hard to understand and words and names were pronounced differently on this CD than on the first few. Just read me the book... make my life easy, I don't like to try very hard."
5,The best of the series,"The left behind series is a worthwhile and as a whole a well written fiction series. (It should not of course be used as a substitute for the actual study of Bible Prophacy) Of the entire series (8 books so far) this one is the best read. It mixes action and characters better than any other. It keeps the reader glued and wanting more. You find yourself caring for these characters more and more in this particular book and Rayford interaction with the newest member of the tribulation force is very well done.In a long series it's not easy to maintain the quality of events and characters, the series as a whole does and this book in particular does it best. If you don't intend to read the series but just want the best taste, then start here."
5,This book shows you that we must pick sides.,This is the best yet. I cannot wait till the next book in august. I beleive the plot is better than the superstars in the market. Tom Clancy or John Grisham have nothing on Jerry Jenkins. This series I beleive will lead to a Soul Harvest of its own . The question is what side will you be on when this time comes. I have also ordered on Tape and will listen to it until the next book arrives.
1,urk,Freakishly bad writing. This word-slaughter doesn't even deserve one star; it begs for a negative black hole. We are all smoking crack if we think this sort of dreck can fly in the general market.
5,Wittness Gifts,I have read this book and all of the books in this series. I have given the series as gifts to my non-Christian friends as a wittness tool. It gives the simple message of salvation and does an excellent job of it. Besides having some very exciting episodes in each book. I would highly recommend it even if you aren't using it as a tool and like stories with great adventure.
5,Fast paced and thought provoking.Can't wait for next one.,"I've now read the series to date and Apollyon follows suit. The twists and turns keep you reading with a ""can't put it down"" attitude.Don't be tempted to skip to the end, too much happens! This is an emotional story. I would like the synopsis of the previous background to have been shorter. Everyone needs to read them all."
3,A fun read but written a little too light weight,"The series have been very fun to read. I have enjoyed the characters and the ongoing development of the storyline. The writing is, however, targeted for readers who have a lighter experience base in literature. Reading this after a Clancy novel is sure much easier, but not as rewarding.Keep em coming, but reduce the font size and put more story in the book."
5,grab your seat and hang on you're in for a bumpy ride!,"What a thrilling book series! I'm glad that I know that when He calls, I'm going with Him! If you're not sure if you're going to get caught up, then grab your seat and hang on you're in for a bumpy ride. It only lasts 7 years, maybe you'll live thru it?"
1,Deceptive. The tool of the devil.,"Has it occurred to anybody that perhaps these books are the tool of the Antichrist? Wouldn't that be the ultimate deception? If evil comes disguised as good, then it is entirely possible that these books, rather than warning Christians about the end, are being used by Satan to deceive and mislead Christians. Perhaps Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins are actually the mouthpieces of the enemy, wolves in sheep's clothing. Do not be deceived. Trust in the Lord, not in Left Behind."
1,one-dimensional characters and dispensationalist propaganda,"I've read every book in this series (borrowed from a friend) and am incresingly frustrated at the authors' inability to create characters that are anything other than victims of the plot in which they are trapped. All their actions read like something from a comic book. What is also distressing is that the authors appear to be using this story as a thinly veiled attempt to prove their personal theological ideas. The Christians in the book are weak, powerless, petty, and usually self-serving. They scoff at the suffering that surrounds them, and the Holy Spirit does seems to be replaced by the human spirit in all of their 'triumphs'. This book is distressing in its pridefulness."
5,Lahaye is once again on target with biblical based fiction.,"This continuation of the series is just as readable as the others. If you have read John's Revelation of Jesus Christ, you can see that Lahaye has captured vividly the ""tribulation"" of this time of life on earth after the rapture. One thing that I have noticed in this book is that he outlines the plan of salvation much more often. Good for him. Maybe these books will reach many who have never studied or read the Bible, but will read a novel."
1,Pathetic,"More of the same terrible writing. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm almost embarrased when I read some of these reviews talking about how well written this garbage is. It's horrible. Not only that, but were it spaced and lined like normal books are, this book would be at least fifty pages shorter. I wish it wasn't true, but I have to think that this series is no more than an effort to take your money and run with it."
1,Disagree,"My disagreement of this book is brief: the word ""rapture"" appears nowhere in the New Testament, which is embarrassing to many who hold the position that the rapture will be real. Additionally, ""Anti Christ"" appears in 1 John 2:18-22; 4:3 and 2 John 7, describing apostaste Christians who were teaching false doctrine regarding the nature of God and Christ. These are the only references to ""Anti Christ"" found in the Bible. Something to think about."
5,Fantastic book,"If you read the other three book of the Left Behind series, you'll love this one. It is one of the few books that I have had a hard time putting down. The only problem is, is that they take so long to produce the next one in the series. Excellent for Bible and non-Bible fans. Read the first three then pick this one up. You believe in the characters and their mission. Very realistist."
5,Best Installment Of The 7!,"Don't listen to the bad comments about what anyone says about this book. If you like what I like in a book: action, suspense, a great story, then you will fall in love with ""Apollyon: The destroyer is unleashed"" This is the best book of the installment so far. It kept me on the edge of my seat with suspense. You will be very pleased. VERY!"
1,What if morons were the only people left?,"I'm sorry, but these books are just terrible. It's hard to determine exactly what makes them so bad. The pace is terrible. The plot is ridiculous. The characters are incredibly thin. But, after reading ""Apollyon"", I'd have to say the worst part is the dialogue. The things the authors have these characters say to each other actually make me groan every page or so. Don't read. These books may make you stupid."
4,Must read for Left Behind fans,"If you are a fan of the Left Behind series then this is a must read. Find out what happens to Rayford, Buck, Hattie and the rest of the gang as Nicolae's true nature is revealed."
2,Buck & Chloe have no business having a kid.,"What the heck is the deal with Buck and Chloe having a kid? What are they thinking? The whole world is about to go kaput, and they're trying to repopulate the world? Lame plot line. Now the future books are going to be saddled with stupid things about raising a kid - midnight feedings, postpartum stretch marks, cloth vs. disposable diapers. As if you could even get diapers in a world where millions have perished and the infrastructure is demolished. At least they won't have to start saving for the kid's college fund, since he won't live to see kindergarten. Spare us the parental details, kill off the kid (or the parents) and get back to the action."
3,Good mythology in line with the previous books in the series,"This book is interesting, entertaining and seems consistent with most fundamentalist interpretations of apocalyptic literature. Great escape literature and not yet as predictable as the books of John Grisham have become. I like that this book has less rehashing of its predecessors too. Besides, the people left behind during the tribulation are sure to be the most interesting people!"
3,Same thing over and over and over......,"I am not a believer in the Rapture but found the first book very informative on what it is all about. However, the following 4 books are pretty much the same stuff repeated. I am hanging in there just because I started but they are getting quite boring."
3,more sculpt than cardio,"I ordered the tape to get some cardio and sculpt, but the workout was more on toning. Also they used the Firm steps, etc that I didn't have. I improvised, and used a chair, a step stool.. I preferred the newer version, where only handweights are needed, and you don't keep swiching from one type of equipment to another"
5,Essential book for the Japanese robot collector.,"In addition to Tim Brisko's incredible photography, Matt Alt and Robert Duban provide a brief history of Japanese toys that explains how these toys fit into the grand scheme of things. Recommended!"
2,Cost of this book is ridiculous and unconscionable.,"This is a required textbook for a College English Class. I assume nobody but a student would buy such a book at this price unless forced, which is exactly the case. The cost of this book is ridiculous and unconscionable.This book should be at the very most $25.00 At the College Bookstore it is was $65 and online $51.There should be student protests all over the country about such ripoffs on campuses - especially tuition costs. In Europe, students would protest in the streets at such exploitation but here in America, the public are sheep that all go to slaughter without so much as a wimper.When will American students become activists looking out for their own interests and social justice? I am betting never."
3,Good but could have been better,"I did receive my order promptly and in time however I received a different edition then the one shown, fortunately my teacher allowed me to have a lower edition of the book."
5,Powerful and enlightening.....not for the faint of heart,"This is probably the most important book written on the subject of Universal Natural Law, for several generations. This book is so dangerous to religeon that there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the author would have been burned at the stake only 200 years ago...or even today, in some of the less civilized parts of the world. The reason is the book gives away for free what religeous authorities would hoard and twist for their own power. There are places in the book where the Divine obviously guided the author's hand. Religious nuts of all flavors will get apoplexy reading this book. Everyone else, should pick up a copy and spend a great deal of time contemplating the truths inside."
2,Not the quality I expected,"Without question Larry Lam is more tolerable than the superfluous Billy Blanks. He also gives much better instruction on form. But when I spend this much on a VHS workout tape, I expect it to be in some kind of studio with a good recording system. It's recorded in some gym with huge fans running, and microphones attached to clothing. And for heaven's sake--what's up with the plentiful chest shots of mascara-laden women in under-sized sports bras? ""Is this for women or men?"", I kept asking myself. As far as the actual workout is concerned, sure it gets you breathing hard, but I was looking for something more comparable to a class I took at a Karate studio-- no frills, no hip hop aerobic moves-- just straight forward self defense made into a workout. I guess I'll keep looking."
3,"love the movie, hated the shipping","I ordered this movie because I had already seen it and was delighted to find it and add it to my collection. I ordered it along with a couple of other purchases. The other items I ordered arrived within the time stated and even earlier. This movie, however, didn't arrive until approximately 2 weeks later! I will not order another movie from this resource."
1,Bad Everything,"I bought 2 pajama sets ,size small, for a xmas present. Both tops were like extra large and both bottoms were like extra small. I returned them at my cost($10.00). Intimo did not correct the problem as promised or phone me back as promised. One month later, they emailed me that the sizing was correct. WHAT??? Intimo issued me store credit. NO REFUNDS. Would you have faith in buying here again with the strong potential for the same result at your return cost? Credit card disputes did not help. Don't shop with Intimo!!! I regret it. I give this item one star because they don tallow 0.Intimo Women's 100% Silk Pajama"
2,Misleading,"I have to disagree with the last reviewer, I bought this CD because it said it was TYA with the original members. When I read that, of course I expected ALVIN LEE! I thought the new guitarist was terrific for a newcomer, but I don't need to hear anyone else play Alvin Lee's songs when he does it so much better! Truthfully, it was kind of disconcerting. Nothing new here to warrant the very high price on this CD, I'm afraid. And it should have been a lot clearer that I wasn't going to be a live Alvin Lee recording."
4,Gret Super-deformed Robocop Set,"The entire Mezitz line of movie tie-ins has been pretty great so far, and this new set is just as good as the others. The figures are well-made, inexpensive, and sport that cool super-deformed look. I wonder if the reviewer who knocked these for that very reason has even HEARD of ""super-deformed"" toys (started by the Japanese, like so many other cool toy trends). These look exactly as they should, and are a lot of fun."
5,Fun to watch....,"Planet destroying space bug , piloted by a hormone challenged traitor, with a walking dead guy and people eating plant for company.. What's not to like?"
1,You've all been fooled!,"I'm afraid I'll get a lot of heat from this, but if you liked this movie, you've lost your mind. I'm afraid all too often people are influenced by critics and intimidated by old black and white films with subtitles. Though it may be a ground-breaking style of film, that does not make it a good film. In a sad attempt to confuse the truth about the death of a man, Kurosawa frustrates audiences with a bad Twilight Zone episode; too long and without that creepy plot twist so very needed. Best performance goes to the bad dubbing-over for the psychic."
4,Everyone needs to get the meaning of this movie . . .,"The movie Rashomon is intended to be conflicting, to the point that the viewer is left with the task of finding the truth. Each character tells some truths and some lies, therefore all the testimonies are both true and false. But beyond the truths and lies is personal interpretation, which is reduced to the individual viewer's subjectivity. As in with life itself, there is no such thing as true objectivity, everything is a variation depending on one's prejudices, motives and background and more so because these variations occur on different levels from materialistic to philosophical. Speaking of philisophical: the meaning of Rashomon is that we can not be honest with our selves about our selves. Our egos drive us to actions that are always self-centered. Each character tells his own story for his oun gains. As the stranger says ""we can not survive unless we are what you call selfish""."
5,Secrets of Rashomon,"Rashomon was the second Akira Kurosawa film I have seen after Yojimbo and I am proud to call it my best film experience so far. The plot is amazing and leaves the audience stunned with its mystery long after the film has ended.The screenplay and photography is wonderfull along with the incredibly amazing acting staff that really gave me a new perspective on films and how strong they seem. I really love this movie and is recommended very strongly.A stunning Masterpiece of a Film, everything is good about it and you wont get dissapointed."
5,Who was lying?,"I recently launched my quest to watch classic movies by Kurosawa by watching first, Seven Samurai, then Yojimbo and finally Rashomon. Of the three, Rashomon is my favorite with it's presentation of four contradictory accounts of a murder. The perspectives are from a bandit, the dead man's wife, the dead man himself(through a medium) and finally a humble peasant. All the stories have a grain of truth but all the stories also contradict each other. As I was watching the movie, the peasant's story seemed to tie up the loose ends except that for the fact that a notorious bandit like Tajomaru does not get that way by being a snivelling coward. He had surely killed many people before and dispatching the noble man in cold blood would not be as difficult for him as the peasant seems to suggest. Then it turns out that the peasant had a reason of his own for fabricating the story.Who is telling the truth? Personally, I believe the dead man. Watch Rashomon and make up your own mind."
1,Bit of a rip off,"If you've seen his other stand up dvd's (Animals,Politics, Fame) then you have seen this. I am not convinced there is a speck of new material in this at all. It's a huge disappointment, as I am a big fan of Gervais."
2,What does this have to do with Jack London's book?,"I love Jack London's books and have since childhood, so it's hard for me to understand why Disney would take a classic book title and make up a new story to go under it. I re-read WHITE FANG two months ago and there is precious little in this movie that was in the book. Jack London did not write kiddie books (nor did Anna Sewell, for that matter) and I understand how difficult it would be to adapt his works to the screen and get a family rating. Even so, people who read and loved the book and expect to see an adaptation of the original classic might well be terribly disappointed. If it's a good film and a good original script, then it should be allowed its own title and the Disney writers should get the credit for the story."
2,It's a Shame (cont'd.),"P.S.- Both the novel and the movie were entirely fictional. There is not a single part of either story which is based on fact. In a way, I like that because it shows just how creative and how excellent a writer Jack London is."
1,Not at All what I Expected,The recipes were not low enough in carbs for my personal preference and too high in fat and calories. The quality of the book is also not what I expected for the amount of money I paid. There are not that many pages or recipes. Not much of a selection. Very disappointed.
3,Fair,"It was all right. It should have told where it was situated, and what era or year. I couldn't figure it out so some of it made no sense. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
5,I'll allways will read this in years to come,"I was a teenager when this came out. My mum brougth this when I first stating reading this I was 14. I kept reading it and reading it and it helped me lern to read good, cause of this book I felt better about reading I am proud to say I collect books about Diana. I feel sorry for her she should've not married, big ears however there are two sides to the story, I like Diana's better.This book was all the rage in England even my loser mum and creepy step- father read it and his only intrest was teenage girls and stupid soccer."
1,n00bs only - waste of $,This book is only good if you've been playing for a day or so.It is not helpful at all to me.. but thats just me.
2,"Airy, nothing concrete","Ugh. This book is *not* worth it. There's a lot of fluff, but almost no information you can't find hundreds of other places. It's just a mishmash of old ideas, with absolutely nothing new or concrete. It *certainly* doesn't focus on herbs, as it might seem to; it mentions them a few times in passing, mostly in only one chapter. Instead, get ""Making Your Small Farm Profitable,"" by Ron Macher. Not only does it cover all the ground covered in this book, it does so without the fluff and feel-good-ness, and with real, concrete, actionable plans and ideas."
5,Insightful and dramatic!,"Reads like a cloak and dagger thriller at times. This is a riveting account of the end of apartheid and the birth of democracy in a society that should be, by all rights, engaged in civil war at this time. Instead, Ms. Waldmeir gives us the reasons, historically and diplomatically, as to why this amazing transition took place in relative peace. She tries to give a fair representation of the roles of all the major players in this incredibly complex real life drama. I found the writing to be very insightful as an academic work while at the same time it was told as the dramatic, tension filled drama that the story truly is."
2,Terrible Publisher,"While the book seems to be fairly well written, reading easily with examples worked out in full detail, there are an abundance of errors throughout the text. Rather than actually correcting these errors, the publisher instead decided to put an ""Errata"" section at the beginning of the book, leaving the mistakes strewn throughout the text. So, prior to reading a chapter, one must look up what errors there are and either make a mental note or correct it by hand. Since the errors are quite copious, 16 pages worth in all with an error every 5 pages, it becomes extremely distracting.From the author's webpage, the following is a list of errata in this edition: [...]."
1,Left my skin dry,"This is an extraordinarily expensive after shave balm, so my expectations were very high. The product went on very smoothy, with no oily residue and no off putting or overwhelming scent. So, right off the bat, I was impressed. That is where my fondness stopped.I have rather dry skin, especially around the corners of my mouth. I had hoped that this balm would have done better than the Nivea Sensitive Extra Soothing Balm I had used in the past, which was adequate. I was sorely disappointed. The reason for a one star rating, as apposed to perhaps two, is the fact that each tiny bottle costs ~ $40! Outrageous! My advice would be to try a much less expensive product."
2,tesla book,Dissappointed because this is not an actual book but more like a photocopy. It has some good information but is not as complete as I thought it would be.
4,Excellent information and very well written,"I am currenty writing a book on Okinawan martial arts and felt that a better overview of the history of Okinawa would better enable me to write my own book. There is little to nothing on Okinawan martial arts in this book, but it is an extremely readable book on the history of Okinawa up to the end of WWII. There are also a couple of addtional small sections at the end of the book with corrections and a brief history of Okinawa from the end of WWII to the end of the twentieth century. I learned a lot from this book and found it to be easy to read and easy to understand. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of the Orient in general and Okinawa in particular."
3,"Informative, but Plates are Missing","This book contains a very thorough description of the history and culture of Okinawa. However, the Plates, listed in the Table of Contents and referenced throughout the text, were missing from the book that I purchased."
3,It does not fully rewind so can't watch the beginning of it,It does not fully rewind so can't watch the beginning of it? Did arrive when it was promised?the end bye
1,Does not follow old storyline by Ludvig Bemelman,"My 4 year old grandson loves the old version of Madeline's Christmas by Ludvig Bemelman. This does not follow that story line. He immediately rejected it saying "" this isn't the right Madeline's Christmas."""
5,Keeps your childs attention!,"I have tried several different videos and this series is excellent. I have 2 of them and my son watches them both. I have been surprised at how well he is picking up the mandarin. It is not just a musical, but also conversation and interaction that keeps his attention. No longer do I have to spend money that ends up being wasted on a video that is not working. I would buy any addition videos that come up in the series!"
5,GE TL86597 InstaJack Wireless Phoneline,This item is simply the best. It replaced the first one I had used for over 15 years. Performance is consistently great! Easy to set up also.
5,Must Read Book - Highly Recommended,This book touches on all of the important aspects of the Criminal Justice System. I have found it very useful in supplimenting my legal education and also in learning about the world around us. You should read this book and open your eyes to what is really going on. This book is full of invaluable and thought provoking information. You must read this book whether fighting for your life or interested in helping others do the same.
4,Nice if it were in print,"I have attempted to order this book for close to a year, and the pub date continues to be moved out. I would love to review the book, but if the publisher cannot get the volume out, that is impossible. Why the long delay/???"
4,Basil Rathbone a Genius On and Off Stage,"I always enjoyed Basil's performances in his movies. His autobiography gives so much insight into a brilliant man. He also had a high moral character, even though he was portrayed as a villian in many of his ""motion pictures"". I regret I never saw him perform liveon stage, I'm sure he was brilliant. His reflections on his life, stage and movie career are very interesting. I especially enjoyed his remarks on some of the greats that new and performed with on stage and in Hollywood."
4,Fun,This movie is fun and very entertaining. Even if you don't believe in angels this is still a good movie. Christopher Lloyd iis excellent in this movie.
3,Disney still don't get it......,"Here is yet another DVD from Disney which has yet to take advantage of the wonders of this media format. They have taken a movie which I loved on VHS placed it on DVD widescreen anamorphic in menus ONLY! THE MOVIE IS IN LETTERBOX..The colors and picture quality are not bad, but why not just do it right the first time.They just don't get it.Alan Miller"
2,Whatchamacallits in the Thingamajig,"A theologically murky, emotionally maudlin, dramatically musty baseball comedy that is visually meritorious. At the press conference, the statements about God and angels are so vague, bland and incoherent as to call into question the wisdom of including angels in the plot at all. Based on the press conference, the movie should have been called whatchamacallits in the thingamajig. Why was the Mel Clark disease plot point sprung on us unless it was to jerk more tears? Was there any other plot point that wasn't telegraphed like a pitcher with a tell? The movie does look good and young children will probably enjoy the slapstick but it isn't very satisfying for the whole family."
3,Worth reading!,"In chronological fashion, this interesting book sets out to describe the creation and the evolution of the English language since its very beginning. Many references are made to essential authors such as Chaucer, Shakespeare and Dickens. The emphasis, of course, is placed on Great Britain and the United States but the specificities developed in India, the West Indies and Australia are also discussed at some length.The audio version should be avoided however as the work includes lists of words that are of course rather tedious to follow. Also, the audio format makes it impossible to go back later to verify the history of a specific word or even a particular author's contribution to the language."
5,The Adventure of English,A wonderful description of the evolution of the English Language from its beginnings to the present day.The author relates the evolution to the world events of the time.He shows the contribution of other languages to English and emphasises that it is constantly evolving
3,The art in the movie is excellent!,"All I have to say is that the art in the movie is extraordinary. John Scane, a local Los Angeles artist, provided some of the artwork, and his work can be seen at Kantor Gallery in West Hollywood, CA. Other than that, Arquette, Capshaw, and Tucci show their comedic side, and are pretty good together. But I'd see it mainly for the art!"
4,"Great acting, actually quite funny, WEIRD!","Watch out, you're in for a great time, but don't forget to lock your doors, if this movie can get into your house, then burglars may seem very ordinary. Give the burglar some popcorn, sit back, I think he's gonna like this one too, don't forget to make that a really big bag, of popcorn. If he has any sense he also sells security system, in case his acting career doesn't pan out. My advice to you, use that few extra bucks you saved on your new secutiy system to get this movie."
4,Cheap looking but functional - now has better packaging,"The glass looks a little cheap and the seam is super ugly, but it'll do the job. The topper seems to seal in nicely. One thing to note is that the seller must have seen the Amazon reviews complaining about the poor packaging because it was greatly improved...almost excessively. Two layers of bubble wrap, large inflatable plastic packing, and two boxes."
2,Not great for LCD,I bought this cleaner with the attention to clean my LCD and plasma TVs. The plasma TV came out perfect while the LCD had a fog to it. If you want to clean your plasma TV then use this product but for LCD TV stay AWAY!
1,Not for Education majors,"I bought this book for my Education Specialist class, and it was useless. But, that's the school's fault. Maybe if you're actually a Communications major it might be more helpful, but the book sure does repeat itself a lot. Also, lots of ""fillers"" are used to share simple ideas."
4,GOOD FOR THE SLOW LEARNER,"After search far and near for a easy to understand yet informative and practical book and music theory and scales, I found this one. I've been playing guitar for around 6-7 years with NO FORMAL training but have practiced scales before which taught me nothing useful. However this book starts with some very practical exercises that have been useful so far in my playing. I have a feeling that if I stick with the lessons in this book over the next couple months I may actually be a better player."
5,Ackley's nursing diagnosis handbook,"I was not thrilled with the textbooks that my nursing college was using. I searched Amazon for books that I felt would help me write care plans without flipping back and forth between NIC, NOC and Nanda. Nursing Diagnosis Handbook: A Guide to Planning Care was just what I needed. The rationales are provided--along with the research data sources. It is also easy to do concept mapping with this book because it lists clusters of symptoms for different medical problems. With the purchase of this book, I have access to the Evolve website--which I find really helpful.Thanks Amazon!"
4,great tool!,"This was a great tool, that helped me with my homework such as nursing care plans as well as with my other nursing classes."
4,Nexes,"Great guy flick, real time racing through the narrow streets was exhilarating to watch on a good large screen. Story line as well as the actors were believable. You may want to add this one to your collection along with Hunt for Red October, T2 and True Lies as well as Jurassic Park."
2,"Great surround sound, awful movie","If you have a good surround sound system in your home, this has killer sound. As a movie, it is banal, boring and plain silly."
2,A good idea gone bad.,"What makes RONIN fail? As an action film, it has plenty of action. Too many characters? Maybe. I found it very hard to focus, like I was always asking the person next to me `what was that?' or, `who is he again?'.Those sort of digressions make me wonder about the story. I could neither stay with it, God forbid ahead of it, as we've been conditioned in most films today of this genre. There have been wonderful, simple heist films (The Italian Job) and complicated ones (Heat), but Ronin is neither, just messy.What might have been a wonderful, fast-paced car chase is destroyed by too many close ups of a very scared Robert Deniro in the chase car. A needless appearance of Katarina Witt verifies that `sold out for no good reason' feeling.The characterizations are all too predictable, Natasha McElhone and Jonathan Pryce are weak in key roles. Stellan Skarsgard is superb, however. Jean Reno and Michel Lonsdale, as always, are excellent.Poor story, poor direction, poor film."
1,A pretentious film about nothing,"This is pretty aweful. The film tries (very unsuccessfully) to study ""the reality"" of assasins and former secret agents. It tries to convey how void of meaning the characters's lives are and how bored they are. But that is done at the cost of boring the audience."
5,One of Frankenheimer's best.,"Unfortunately, I have had to wait a long time for this excellent film to be realeased on video in England, I even considered good enough to warrant two cinema viewings. Every area of the film was put together with sheer professionalism, including the casting which gave Jean Reno another chance to shine after his brilliant performance as Leon. Although the centre piece of the film is undoubtably the fantastic car chase through the streets of Paris, the build up to it was very well acted by all, adding a hint of tension and expectation. DeNiro's rather painful scene was another highlight, as was Sean Beans' failure to keep his dinner down after some good driving by one of his associates. Some reviews I have read have said that it to slow for an action film, but I don't think the director set out to make another guns and explosions adventure, just a well rounded and very entertaining film. See it!"
1,Dialogue,"There was no Quint Tarantino style dialogue, though it offers that pretense. I found it virtually impossible to suspend disbelief. The script seemed canned and by the numbers instead of creative cinema art. De Niro is one of my favorites, but even he couldn't overcome the lousy directing and crummy script. The accents of the characters were transparently fake. There was little suspense as every scene was so predictable.If this is the best (1st I've watched) Amazon has to offer its 'prime' customers, forget that as a bonus. I couldn't work up the desire to finish watching the film, so I didn't."
2,To fast paced and too jumpy !,This movie was so fast paced and so jumpy I had to use playback option to understand plots and subplots. mr. Robert has made better movies than this and acting was real bad. Love interet was not very good in her part plus she had real poor Irish accent. Movie also had way to many bad guys and way to many plots for it wo be watchable. I say if you pay more than $10 for this movie you are getting taken. It is the kind of movie 1 viewing of it and you are done period.
2,FROM JAPAN/ japan verson,"this is here because of amazon japan do not buy just wait it out. if you are into hong kong movies then wait for a brittish relese of mad detective, as most hong kong blurays are watermarked. most of the time blurays of american films not relesed here but someweres els are of low quality nuliffing the gold brick price because in the end its just a pice of plastic with code on it. all good things come to those who wait for r1"
4,Fantastic Bluray,Fantastic movie. Watching the car chase scenes on HD keeps you on the edge of your seats. A must have for Bluray collectors.
5,Excellent Action Packed Movie,"Unlike some moves you get a sense of realism, the car chase scenes are excellently choreographed, and the movie is fairly clean of vulgarity and sexuality which makes it a great clean action movie. Also, Robert De Niro plays an excellent character which really brings you into the movie."
2,zzzzzzz,"Oh man, this is a terrible movie.So its not like your usual Hollywood formula lets blow stuff up and put beer in the dog's water bowl shoot 10 million people every single day action flick. Its still lame.I mean, um, well its a boring movie. Really. Great cast, bad script.The car chases, while half-way realistic are pretty dang boring. I can't find any other words to describe this film but boring.Its basicly Mission Impossible trying to be Mad Max. If you want a really beyond Hollywood action flick check out Fallen Angels.Good DVD, packed with good stuff, if your a fan of this film pick it up. If not, why are you here?"
4,Great thinking (wo)man's movie.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The scenery and location was real and beautiful at the same time. To me it had a very non-Hollywood feel, and a terrific realism applied to everything; especially the gun fights and the *incredible* car chase scenes. You'll appreciate the detail even more if you listen to the director's comments on the DVD version. One of those movies that, after you watch it, you feel like you've read a book instead of watched a flick."
2,A little farfetched,"One of the hard things to believe about this movie is that an undercover CIA agent, played by Deniro, will actually go through surgery, having a bullet removed, by an amatuer in order not to blow his cover. This would never happen in real life. Also, the alternate ending on the DVD did not make much sense to me. This has all of the cliche's of all action movies, long car chase scenes, guns shooting, and the mysterious betrayals left and right, not knowing who is on who's side. Further, this is not Deniro's best performance. I would pass on this one."
4,Full of special features,"There are many reasons to buy this DVDa)It has the best car chase scene everb)It is filmed on the beautiful streets of Francec)It stars Robert De Nirod)Has a gripping adrenalin pumping storylinee)Great supporting cast including Jean Reno, Sean Bean and Natasha McElhone&f)Is full of heaps of great special features."
4,Grew on a second viewing,"This feels a bit like of mix of Percy Adlon's earlier 'Bagdad Café' andRobert Altman's 'Three Women', set in Alaska.k.d. lang plays an androgynous miner who falls in love with a straight, private, local German librarian.They both have muddy, tragic pasts that slowly emerge. There are some deeply moving moments, andsome wonderful slightly magical realist touches. The cinematography is very good. But while lang does asurprisingly decent job, I can't help thinking a stronger, more experienced actress could have brought outeven more in this amazing role.That said, I did enjoy this much more on a second viewing. While it bothered me that it felt at times likeAdlon was trying to simply re-create the magic of `Bagdad Café' (odd, surreal setting, quirky out of placecharacters, cinematography that uses color in exaggerated ways for effect, etc.) overall I foundmyself more able to just let go and accept this tale on its own merits. And doing that, it made me smile."
1,"Great Song, Shame about the film...","If you are not a lesbian, run don't walk to get a recording of k.d. singing Calling You, and give this movie a wide pass. It's appeal is VERY narrow... 'nuff said."
2,Why are sequels always bad?,I loved Homeward Bound I. It was a warm and funny movie that was well made. I blindingly thought I'd like the second one too since I loved the first one so much. Boy was I wrong. It was cheesy! The bad guys and the extras all seemed like amateur actors. I learned my lesson. Sequels are not worth it!
1,Not worth your time when there are so many other good books,"On the plus side, the science in the book was interesting and bioterrorism is certainly a hot topic. However, as a novel, the book failed completely. The writing was abysmally bad, the characters' motivations were missing or unbelievable, the characters were one-dimensional, and the plot made no sense. I didn't care one way or another what happened to the protagonist or his friends. I only finished it so that I could discuss it with a friend but I really had to force myself to read. Don't waste your time."
4,A lot of thinking went into this story.,"Before modern mankind had classified the insects and given names to disease, the ten plagues were loosed upon Egypt by ""I AM"". Could these plagues be mimicked today by, let's say, a mad man?! That is exactly what happens in this story. It is easy reading and satisfying to be able to figure out who the villain is without needing a masters in criminology to do it. The real scary thought is if some person reading this story may want to try any of this stuff out on people. In response to that frightful question, I have read on the ProMed medical bulletin board that the facts have been changed enough to prevent this from becoming a bioterrorist cookbook. You can relax. Read it and enjoy!"
3,"Excellent premise, riveting in some chapters, lost in others","The plagues are ominous and quite interesting in their development. It certainly makes you wonder about possibilities for modern day biological warfare. Keep this book away from Sadam! Though I enjoyed it, It would drag in some chapters. Wait for the paperback edition."
5,A must read for lovers of the Medical Thriller genre,"This was a fascinating blend of medical horror, religeous history, and a very real view of the world of virology, epidemiology and medicine. The character development was right up there with Dean Koontz and possibly more intense."
4,PLAGUING BY THE RULES,"If you can avoid all the techno-[material] and long histories of some of the characters, you're in for a frightening look at how easy bioterrorism is. THE ELEVENTH PLAGUE revolves around a madman's plot to mirror the ten plagues of Moses and kill off vast amounts of people all in the name of God. Character-wise, there's no one here we haven't met before, and even the villain is rehashed from Dr. Phibes through Hannibal Lechter. However, the book has some terrifying scenes and some surprises, too. It's a little long in the tooth and is nowhere as realistically frightening as THE HOT ZONE, but it's still a scary read.RECOMMENDED."
5,Great read.,Have read it twice before. Good story and provides insight into the Bible Book of Revelation. Others I know have read it more than once.
2,And I'm done with the series...,"Although I am of a secular world view, I admit the hype surrounding this series sparked my interest. This spark quickly expired and I am confident in saying I will not be reading any materials from LaHaye and Jenkins again.I read this book shortly after completing Left Behind. I found Left Behind to be somewhat entertaining and thought, well, let's give the rest of the series a go. About half way through Tribulation Force I regretted this decision and cursed my inability to put abandon a book once I've started it.The storyline between the characters in this series is painfully dull and reeks of those ""after-school-dramas"". Honestly, if the authors stuck to their take on the actual Rapture, they'd have a winning story. But they haven't and I can't take anymore."
1,Dating - Circa 1920,"First of all, I will read the next one because I have read that it is a lot better then this book. Then again, I have read better character development in my son's Blue's Clues books. The problem is that this book centers on the characters and their dating turmoil which frankly made me cringe. A 30 year old 'famous' journalist who cannot even hold a girls hand! Silly. During the ""most historic moment of our time"" he is eating a cookie because his girlfriend is too. Come on! He kisses her about 8 months after they start dating and is so happy after she effortlessly HOLD HIS HAND in public - even though they are married. And, all of a sudden, Rayford is married. Please! It's a shame because the last few pages are excellent and I wish the authors would concentrate on the end-times rather then ""Leave it to Beaver II"". Poorly written - but I'll try the third one."
1,Leave this false rapture teaching behind,"Leave this false rapture teaching behind. Read Carl Olson's ""Will Catholics be left behind?"" Totally debunks the ""Rapture"" and these books."
3,Good follow up,Was so drawn into the first book that I had to get the second. Glad I did. Sure wish they would have brought it to a close though. That is why it only got 3 stars.
3,It's getting dry.,"I loved the first book so much I couldn't wait for this one. Though it explains Revelations in ways I never could have understood otherwise, it is getting predictable and dry. The authors are doing a good job building the characters, but Nicolae is just too predictable and insane. Surely the population at large would know by now, or at least have an inkling who he is. I'm now reading ""Nicolae"", which is not a whole lot better, but it is keeping my interest, kind of like a soap opera with one drama after another. At any rate, it's making me review my faith, and this alone is worth it."
5,The best book!,"Intriguing, exciting, fast paced drama. The 2nd book brings a whole new perspective on the view of the new testiment. As the book unfolds, evil, love, hatred, preaching, understanding, and death are entwined, leading to whatever there is to come."
2,"Disappointing follow-up to ""Left Behind #1""","This was a pretty okay read. The early struggle between Chloe and Buck was ridiculous, tiresome and sloooooooow. Some of the other subplots going on didn't flow overly well, and the political aspects didn't seem very plausable. I did enjoy reading about the 2 witnesses, and for a while, that aspect of the story kept my interest."
3,"Interesting, BUT","I don't find the premise biblically accurate. Where in the Bible does it state Christians will be raptured BEFORE the tribulation??? It's always nice to think we'll be gone, but it looks to me like we'll see more than these books would have you believe."
3,A step down from the first Left Behind book,This story is the continuation of Rayford Steele and Buck Williams from the first book. This one was a huge disappointment from the first one. There was way too much lovey dovey stuff in it between Buck and Chloe. I though I was going to be sick at times. Is this a book about how not to get a date in high school or is it about the end of the world. I was disappointed but I hear book #3 makes up for this mistake.
2,Poor sequel to a good book,"I liked the first left behind. The constant developpement of the plot when the characters realize that everything around them is written in the bible makes you wonder.The problem is that the poor aspects of the 1st left behind are overemphasized in Tribulation Force. I wanted to know what was happening to the temple, to New Babylone, to the new Global Community...i got pages and pages of cheesy platonic love dialogues between shallow characters.Also, while the first book was subtle about instilling the idea of conversion in your mind, this one gets you right into it without false pretense. It becomes repetitive and can fall on your nerves because it is so obvious.I believe that this subtlety made the charm of LB. It is lost in TF.I will give a chance to Nicolae (book 3) if it is much of the same, it will be my last one"
2,Is there a point to the second book?,"To tell you the truth, this book is a dissapointment compared to the other books. I did not need to hear anything about Buck of Chloe, atleast not through the whole book. Like what someone said, only the last part is good. But luckily I read LeftBehind already...if I had read this book first, I would have never chose LeftBehind becuase this book [stunk]... But the other books rocks!"
2,a lot slower than Left Behind,"""Left Behind"" was phenomenal, 5-stars. But ""Tribulation Force"" had very little to hold my interest. ""Nicolae"" was much better. Can't wait to read ""Soul Harvest"" much love in Christ."
2,T.F. - too long and too romantic.,"Well....I guess that I'll read Nicolae because my mom liked it and hey, moms know best! Well the whole marraige thing upset me and I didn't care for the 18 months later thing so I give this a 2 Star award!!! A little worse from my 5 star Left Behind rating. I didn't learn much about the rapture from this book. All I learned was that eating a cookie on TV makes you look like a love sick puppy. BOW WOW. PLEASE MAKE NICOLAE A GOOD BOOK."
2,Amanda's presence raises some troublesome issues.,"The authors made a big mistake in having Rayford hook up with Amanda, a minor character whose only role is to provide a romantic plot. What's going to happen at the end of the series, at the Glorious Appearing, when Rayford is reunited with his first wife, Irene? What will she think or say about her husband remarrying when he knows that the tribulation means that the marriage won't last anyway? Amanda is little more than a marriage of convenience, or if you like, of desperation."
4,"Very good book, however...","I found this book very interesting, however contrary to the opinion of some of the other customers, I think it wasn't quite as good as the first. For a while it drags on semi-boring job details. A must read if you read ""Left Behind"". A well written sequel to one of the best books I've ever read. -Jessie"
3,Depends upon your perspective,"I have only read the first two books of the series so far, but I found them enjoyable. Hopefully, the authors are only speculating, and not predicting, how the true Rapture would play out. Some people I know have read these books and gotten the idea that this is how things are really set to happen. If one is truly living a Christian life, there's nothing to worry about! The strength of these books is their ease of reading, plus the authors genuinely do a good job of keeping the action and suspense constantly present. Just don't take the eschatology literally!"
4,Yet another thriller!,"I will also admit that this book is not nearly as good as the rest, but I think it was necessary! We have to get to know the characters better, and there's no other way to do it than through reading about them. That's pretty much all that happens in the book, but there are a few other things. We find out that the antichrist in Nicolae Carpathia, that the times are going to get much worse, and more. A must read if you intened to finish the rest of the series(which I would also highly recommend!)"
5,charactor manual of survivial in the tribulation,"THis was the first book I actually read in the series. I enjoyed it enough to read them all. I have read several of books of similar nature, including Pat Robinson's. This series strikes me as the most acturate. The charactors are real enough to be believeable and I was sympathic to their cause."
1,Egads.,"This is utter dreck. I remain at a loss as to why this ill-conceived and hackish series continues to make the best seller list. I am particularly disturbed at the xenophobic impulse which gives the Antichrist(whatever that may be) a foreign name, multilingual abilities and influence in the United Nations. What is wrong with the American reading public? Not to mention that the phrase ""Tribulation Force"" gives the reader an image of lycra-clad superheroes stuck in a bad morality play. It's all just plum silly and a complete waste of ink."
4,"Not What I Expected, But...","The book is smaller than it was pictured, and what I expected, but I have to say that the recipes and household suggestions are quite good. Sound advice from a 90-year-old cookbook!"
2,Disappointing & expensive book,This book just scratched the surface and I was extremely disappointed in the contents. Very little information about the many china shapes and patterns. Nothing about the beautiful bird figurines that Rosenthal is noted for. Lots of pretty pictures but not enough useful content.
4,Bleak Noir,"I bought Brotherly Love, a discounted, yet signed, copy from the remaindered section of the bookstore where I used to work. At the time I was enamored by Pete Dexter, whose books Train and Paris Trout I had recently read. Both of those books are spare and menacing, at times brutally violent, but done in a masterful way. Brotherly Love is like those books, but to call the book spare is an understatement. Dexter takes his time - most of the book, really - fleshing out the main characters, cousins Peter and Michael Flood from a Philadelphia gangster family. As the plot slowly develops - or comes to a boil, one might say - it becomes clear that Peter wants out. But of course, Michael and his band of hoods keep dragging him back in. In Brotherly Love, Dexter doesn't quite plumb the emotional depths of his characters as he does so effectively in Paris Trout and Train, and the reader is left with a book that feels empty and characters that feel doomed from page one."
4,Terrific,"The only thing that mars this novel is some really bad writing when it comes to the women characters. Other than that, this is close to being a great book."
1,terrible dvd,"What an awful DVD!! Language is Japanese, with NO subtitles. Thus, it doesn't make any sense, unless you'd understand Japanese. This DVD doesn't have menus or chapters. It's by far the poorest DVD I've ever seen, and a complete waste of money. Definetely not worth buying."
2,Not for beginners,"I liked the high speed but it is definately not for beginners. There is virtually no instruction on how to do moves correctly, and you could end up hurting yourself if you haven't been taught the correct way previously.Also, I felt very rushed and there's very little warm up. You kind of have to do something else before starting.Yoga Zone is much better."
1,The Exhibitionist,"I did not understand the need or marketing ploy to have Rodney Yee clad in trunks that were so tight that you could clearly see the outline of his private parts! What an exhibitionist! The routines were boring, too."
3,"Great film, poor product","This is a fantastic film, but unfortunately this DVD package is not worthy of the work. The subtitles are the main point of criticism here - at times they are illegible (white captions on white backgrounds) and when they are legible the translation is often an embarassment (grammatical errors and typos throughout). If your Italian is strong, though, you shouldn't have too many complaints."
3,it's okay,I bought this for my husband and I. We just wanted a small maker for breakfast. It makes the perfect amount but it's a cheesy coffee maker. The plastic lid for the coffee pot keeps going crooked. I DO like the mesh filter and it brews a full pot in a few minutes. It does the job for the price.
4,"Works well, small, one flaw","This is a nice little coffee maker. It's perfect for an office or anyplace small. My only complaint, like other reviewers, is it just doesn't keep the coffee very warm, and if you add even a small amount of cold milk or cream, like I do, then you end up with even cooler coffee. The first cup out after brewing seems to be hotter than the second cup after it's been sitting on the hotplate for a while. I would recommend this coffee maker with this one caveat on temperature."
5,Excellent for the money and a lot more cookware!,"Most cookware packages come as 10-piece. I have had this set for nearly two years now, and it is still holding up good as new. Someone mentioned that this cookware can be hard to clean or food will stick when cooking. That has never been the case for me in anything, from grilled cheeses to sauteeing vegetables. However, if you use gas, make sure the flames don't lick up the sides of the cookware.. it will permanently discolor it. Also, you cannot cook with these at too high of a temperature."
1,DOES NOT FIT USA XG350 VERSION!,"Ordered this part for my 2004 XG350 and when it arrived I noticed it was 1"" in diameter smaller than what is stock on my vehicle. AND YES, THE PART NUMBER WAS CORRECT! (I wonder if this was meant for the European vehicles.)I was able to return the items to Amazon and they paid for the return shipping. NO HASSLE!I have never had good luck with the Beck/Arnley products. I stay far away from them."
3,A short and not-so-sweet story,"This story was very short and not exactly what I feel should be called a classic.This is the story of a man named Fettes, who was an anatomy professor's assistant when he was younger. He would wake up every morning at 4 a.m. to pay two men who delivered a dead body for the professor's anatomy class. Fettes soon discovered that all the bodies that are coming in were victims of murder. When the men refused to deliver bodies anymore to him, he and a fellow student, named Macfarlane, became the ones who murder or dig graves for bodies.I do not see how this short, and rather blandly told, story could be a classic. The language and the way Stevenson tells the story is often-times confusing and uninteresting. It is neither scary, nor a mystery. Look elsewhere for good reading.~Atalanta"
4,"""Heart of Stone"" is a ""Heart of Gold""","Cher's 1989 album ""Heart of Stone"" is one of the best Cher albums that I own (I have seven). I bought the CD just for the song ""If I Could Turn Back Time"" and started to like ""Still in Love with You"", ""Heart of Stone"", ""LOVE ON A ROOFTOP"", ""Emotional Fire"" and ""Starting Over"". If you're a ""Cher"" fan you'll love this album!"
5,A Civil War battle book of the highest caliber.,"If you are a Civil War buff as I am you will find Battle ofThe Wilderness one of the best researched and written booksof the gendre. Rhea's descriptions are vivid and even thoughyou know the outcome of this battle you relive every hourthrough his step by step recounting of the action.For those who have never read Civil War history this isa moving tale of two of the greatest Generals locked inmortal combat, as well as how the common soldier fared inone of the most bloody battles of the Civil War."
2,British Humor,"Just not my cup of tea. Maybe when I watch it again I'll get into the mood and follow it more closely. An early work of Dame Maggie Smith. The theme is about how to raise yourself to a higher standing in a community and do it through the escapades of finding and cooking a pig. Whatever, I just expected more hilarity. How very American of me!"
4,great modern day gothic heroes,"great book if you are into vampires.... I am a lover of Anne Rice novels so this one really took my fancy. the book I have has two novels in one. Hope she writes more about these characters, cause I really enjoyed them all!!"
4,!,"Book arrived in stated condition and prior to est. arrival date. Not a bad read, would have been better minus the lead author."
4,Meaning of Jesus,"I bought this book for my husband, who says it is an interesting approach to an age-old question. He is still reading it, so that's something."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book on the recommendations of Amazon readers, but I found it to be a very poorly written book in many ways. The ""secret"" of the book was obvious from the start, the plot was disjointed, the characters were unbelievable and bland. Many loose ends were not tied up. The meaning of Judaism in the characters' lives was not shown except for the mention of letters in Yiddish and various Jewish foods and holidays. The very end didn't make sense with the rest of the book.I wanted to like this book and did like certain parts individually, but on the whole I thought the book didn't live up to its reviews."
4,This long way home is heartwarming.,"In this story of three generations of a Southern Jewish familythere has been a secret, hinted at, obliquely wielded. In the crisisof her mid-life, Thea begins to unravel the mystery that has haunted her life, at first wanting to share it with her younger sister. In the adventure of deciphering some letters written in Yiddish between their mother's mother & sister, Thea unearths a heartbreaking lie & her sister begs her to desist. I found this book absorbing & very well done! END"
4,Love Dr. Joy,"This is not a new book, however for a friend going through some difficulties it seemed like a good way to offer some help and advice! Dr. Joy offers practical, no-nonsense advice with no room for self-pity; she seems to be able to accomplish more in a short time than many shrinks do over an extended period."
1,Disapointing and confusing,"After reading Womack's books on lean, Feld seemed to be coming from a completely different perspective. The intriguing title and description suggested to me this book would be helpful in furthering my understanding of lean concepts (as described by Womack) and how to implement them. While I found a few bits and pieces to be helpful, overall it suggested a much different and confusing approach. In addition the way ideas were presented seemed to come more from a ""how things might be done"" rather than ""how things were done that lead to success."""
3,Question?????,"Folks,Could someone PLEASE comment on the Quality of the VIDEO OUTPUT of these Coby 'toys'. I could only find one mention re the A/V output, but it was in passing - nothing detailed.I would be interested in hearing your comment re ANY of the Coby units, but I think comments re the DP562 5.6"" model, as it requires that you shrink down you photos to low-res, would be of high interest to your fellow inmates :).I'm imagining that the DP562's pix (resolution of 480 pixels by 234 pixels) can't look that hot on a 26/27"" tube or a 32"" LCD, but I may be wrong :o. I'm guessing that the larger models with the higher (native) resolution should provide nice viewing on any tube, but again I might be wrong.So I hope some of you happy (or unhappy) campers will provide a little feedback re the A/V output, Much thanXs.angel"
4,Photo Player,The photo frame was purchased as a Christmas gift and as such has not been given; but being inquisitive; I opened the box to see how it works. I am glad I did because it simple will not work without the additional purchase of a memory card.Would be nice if the advertising would include this information. Would have save me a trip to the Mall.
3,sharpness and vibrant colors were not there...,I did'nt like this because the sharpness and the vibrant colors were not there as if I was to view it on my computer. It did not operate well with my photo program.
4,"5,000 Open Salts","Very good ""reference"" book for any collector or antique dealer to have for valid identification of collectible open salts. Because it includes all types of open salts, i.e.porcelain (china), glass, silver, etc., it is invaluable for not only the beginning collector, but for the advanced collector wishing to positively identify their collection. It gives just enough ""history"" and information about this interesting little collectible to make the book interesting, but happily, the focus is on identifying individual salts for the collector. The photos are such a nice plus (as some guides have only line drawings). One needs to purchase another ""guide"" that gives values and rarity, but as an identifying source, ""5000 Open Salts"" is wonderful."
5,Its really good book for exchange student to study TOEFL,It is very good bookBarron is the best product for TOEFLI recommened it
4,Defenatly NOT his best .,I gave it 4 stars insted of 3 only as my respect to his earlier music . As my friend Alejandra said : after he mooved to US from Japan...he is not the same anymore .What Kitaro's music was about ? About the feelings it was waking up inside you . What did I feel while listening to this album ?... Nothing ?!
3,It is small,I love the product but one should be able to step back and see the poses on a wall poster. If it were larger it would be a five star.
4,Surprisingly entertaining.....,"As a fan of low-budget sci-fi and horror, I've found that in most cases poor plot and poor acting can provide worthwhile entertainment if one keeps an open mind. I maintained this open mind when I popped Mindwarp into the VCR and was pleased with how entertaining and good this movie turned out to be. Set in post-apocalyptic times when most of humanity lives in a virtual-reality dream-state, it features a woman who desires a ""real"" life and, as a result, is outcast to a hostile wasteland. Bruce Campbell is excellent as the ""hero"" who rescues her from the elements and the wasteland inhabitants -- cannibals. Angus Scrimm (from the Phantasm films) is delightful as the demented underworld cannibal leader. It may sound strange (text on the back of the box gives little insight about the film), but the movie has a very good plot, good special effects and some surprises that easily place this movie in the ""own"" category."
4,Wilton Candy Melts,"Wilton has amazing products. The color of this yellow is perfect for making ""troops"" support ribbons. They melt well, a little on the thicker side, but still work just fine."
1,Charming? Boring!!!!,"I read this book on the strength of the reviews. I did not find it a bit charming after the first chapter. What I found it to be was startlingly Anti-American. And what is worse, I found it incredibly boring after the initial chapter. I found myself skipping pages, then chapters, trying to find something ""charming"" or remotely interesting. Save your money on this one."
3,I hope the author reads this review...,"Although I enjoyed reading the book, I question all the references to Anti-Americanism. The author states ""historical"" problems with U.S. interference. I try to keep current on issues but have never heard of the situations she describes concerning the U.S. involvement with Greece. I have always found the Greek people to be very friendly and welcoming. IF the author's information is correct I would hope everyone keeps in mind that U.S. government decisions are not necessarily the decisions of the U.S. people. Why be uspset with a PERSON from a foreign country simply because of decisions their GOVERNMENT has made?"
4,'O' Crque book.,"I bought this book used as a gift for a friend whose favorite cirque show is 'O'. As far as technical information regarding the show, it has next to nothing about it. There is however a lovely and artistic collection of photographs from the production. In that regard the book is a wonderful purchase."
3,good book with not-so-good pictures,"I found this book an excellent source and a good introduction for Akikdo. There are several techniques in the book, accompanied by very clear and concise verbal explanation. The only thing I don't like is the quality of the pictures. Most of them are too dark and too small. It is difficult to see the exact hands position in the picture. If you are an experience Aikido practitioner, you probably can guess what they are doing and how to place your hands in certain technique. If not, it's hard to see the subtle point of the technique.Of course, even the best book is not a substitution of a real practice with a good teacher, but good books can help you a lot. I think this book is a good reference for a seasoned Aikidoka, but for a beginner or a general audience (like me) who needs more accurate description and illustration of teachniques, two books by Mr. Gozo Shioda are much easier to follow."
1,Black Shoes - Description is Wrong,"In the description, it says ""Black is made of a leather that has a classic smooth finish"". Imagine my surprise when the shoes arrived and saw that they have a microfiber (i.e. synthetic) upper. I tried to contact Amazon to ask if they accidentally shipped the wrong shoes. Instead, Amazon's return system automatically sent me another pair of the same shoes and asked me to return the originals. Didn't really help my case much. Anyway, beware...if you buy the black ""leather"" sandals, that's not really what you're going to get."
3,Easy to set up; works; slow compared to other equipment,"Just bought the 2TB LaCie Ethernet Disk Raid Unit. Easy to set up, and the software works as documented in the documentation (that's a treat!). Putting a shared folder online was very easy. But you have to be patient with this unit. It's slow.It was slow to complete the setup steps, having to reboot itself several times. And, when set up as RAID level 5 (fault-tolerance) it is a very slow shared disk drive. Using a gigabit network, It took more than an hour to copy 20 gigabytes from other computers to this device. On the same network it typically takes 15 to 20 minutes to copy 20 gigs. Even doing a directory listing of the files in the folders is slow.So it works; just be patient."
2,"Very, very dull.","This really doesn't match up to Castle of Cagliostro. Lupin isn't as funny or wacky or as hyperactive. The scenery and music are uninspired and plot just isn't interesting.The only good thing about this 'un is the nudity (only in the uncut version) provided by Fujiko. It helped spice up some of the tedious scenes. CoC had a formidable villian and set up the movie for some imaginative set-pieces. The locations in TSoTG are not very vivid or engaging.Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen don't even provide decent sideshow entertainment this time. It's like they were just filling a contractual obligation by appearing.The DVD is in full-frame with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent amount of extras, including quite a few trailers. But one curious thing. There is no chapter selection on the disc or timecode displayed on the player once inserted. Though you can still skip to the next scene number using the remote."
4,"""Please people, don't make me out a monster. I didn't eat the Capt. Mateo.""","In director Luis Llosa's ANACONDA, Jon Voight clearly relishes his campy role of a South American game hunter who commandeers a boat and National Geographic documentary crew so he can capture alive a monstrous Amazon River constrictor that's big enough to swallow a whole cow.Don't worry about the cheap special effects, just enjoy watching Voight, Owen Wilson and others disappear down the creature's seemingly limitless maw. (Trust me, it's a fun picture.).Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(4.3) Anaconda (USA/Brazil/Peru-1997) - Jennifer Lopez/Ice Cube/Jon Voight/Eric Stolz/Jonathan Hyde/Owen Wilson"
1,Very bad movie!,"This movie was terrifically bad! The acting was well below average, the special effects were shoddy and the story line is weak. It is a shame this movie didn't get a R rating because it is very violent! If I were one of the actors, I would be embarassed to admit it. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone!"
4,Jungle Thriller,"Anaconda is an excellent jungle thriller set in the Amazon River. The huge and scary man-eating snake is making life hell on earth for a team of people in search of a rare Indian tribe along the Amazon River.This is an action packed film, full of suspense and has some excellent special effects. There is also great acting by the likes of Jennifer Lopez, Eric Stoltz Jon Voight and Owen Wilson.This is an enjoyable (if creepy and scary) film that is well worth watching especially for snake lovers."
1,One of the worst ever,"What do terrible special effects, terrible acting and a stupid story line equal? One of the worst movies ever made. Unless you really want to waste an hour and a half of your life, I suggest you avoid this movie like the plague."
3,Be aware: no extra features,"I am not going to go into a review of the movie Anaconda b/c others have done a pretty good job with that (My rating would be 3.5 stars). THIS IS A WARNING: Although the Superbit version does have slightly better sound and picture, there are absoultely no extra features. The increase in picture and sound performance is not significant enough to sacrifice extra features. So I reccomend buying the regular version of the Anaconda DVD and not the Superbit version.My rating of the superbit collection DVD is a 2.5"
3,This movie was filmed in a parallel Universe...,"Cue up the DVD at about 71 minutes and watch the waterfall flow upwards as they back the boat up! ""Heck, boys, why spend more money to film the boat actually backing up when we can just use stock footage run in reverse?"" Hillarious that this could get into a finished film!"
4,"Personal Favorit,DVD SUCKS",A personal favorit ovie of mine yes the Anaconda looks terrably fake but still is enteraning...By the DVD is kinda like just buying it on VHS Yes the sound is more imrpoved but the picture just the same. The good thing is that it atelast gets the widescreen treatment it decerves. Some Deleted sceans wouldent have hurted or commintary! but comes wiht a booklet thats intresting to read.
4,"Don't Judge a ""Movie"" by its cover",When I was looking around Blockbuster for a good non R rated snake movie I found Anaconda sitting on its shelf. The eyes of the Anaconda looked like they came from a deranged walrus. When I popped the VCR in my Video Machine I was really amazed. It was much better than Python and Boa. Those movies were so bad I can't even explain how bad they are. 0 doesn't even explain the rating for these movies. They deserve a rating of - 4 billion. If you rent this video and are a current victim like me take the tape anf throw it in a fire place add 2 gallons of oil and set it on fire then go to the video store and ask for your money back (if they don't give your money back beat up the clerk)Now back to Anaconda. This movie is one of the top dangerous Animal attack movies#1 Jaws#2 Silent Predators#3 Anaconda#4 Lake Placid#5 ArachnophobiaThis movie is great except for the acting. ENJOY!
3,The money can't buy a solid script!,"After his filmic project, ""The specialist"", Luis Llosa bet hard with this movie that certainly lacks of central nerve in its script. A group of investigators go to the Amazon for making a documental about a tribe, but meanwhile, in the middle of a night storm they will aid to a strange (Jon Voight) who has other plans in mind.So, the film will experience a twist of fate just for showing the true proposal of this mysterious man: to capture anacondas.Special effects, and the well expected gore sequences will make the rest of this hodgepodge movie, that thanks to the presence of Voight, the alluring J. Lo and the young Owen Wilson are worthy to be watched.Entertaining, but nothing else, one of these recommended movies for a lazy afternoon."
4,Jaws of the 90s,"It's an outstanding original production of its kind. I wish the movie shows more floral & fauna around the great amazon basin and not too much focus on the snake. Fireflies were nice, a wild boar, tiger & wasp. And what about piranhas and wild flowers? They're part of the wild life, too. Anyway, the movie has its purpose to terrify viewers that anacondas kill and eat their prey including MAN?!? Jennifer Lopez shines in this movie."
3,Takes a little bit too long to get the point!,"To be honest you didn't see the snake in the first 1/2 hour which made the movie slightly boring. It's about Jon Voights character - an evil guy who lets his 'mates' (Jennifer Lopez, Eric Stolotz, Ice Cube) into the world of Anacondas! I think that Jennifer Lopez did a really good job of acting and the snake looked pretty real but it needed the get to the snake quickly to make it a better movie!"
1,I watched it for Kari Wuhrer,"Disastrous movie has only one saving grace and that's sexy actress Kari Wuhrer, who is absolutely stunningly beautiful. Unfortunately, she has to take a back seat to Jennifer Lopez."
1,A REALLY BAD RIP-OFF OF JAWS PLUS BAD ACTING TOO.,ANACONDA in my opinion is as bad as you can make a movie.With the snakes which look as fake as a GRADE B MOVIE the acting is awful too from JON VOIGHT to JENNIFER LOPEZ who seem like they need good acting lessons. My advice avoid ANACONDA you won't regret it.
4,Trekking map,"This is just what I needed. The paths are clearly marked as are the camp sites and contour lines. Some of the print is very small and sometimes blends in too much with the background colour, but you will be able to work it out. All walks are also given an approximate walking time which really helps give an idea of the terrain before you go there."
2,research only,"This map is enormous. Don't expect to take it with you. Kind of a waste of money, even though it's fun to look at before you go. I'm sure there is a smaller one you can get at the park."
5,Systematic Theology that Reads Like a Great Novel,"Last spring at about this time, I read Christ Plays in Ten Thousand Places, Peterson's first volume in his projected five volume work in spiritual theology. It was poetic, beautiful, and systematic, and spiritual. I am a devoted reader of theology, so even really dense and plodding works are ""fun"" for me to read. But Peterson is unique- he writes his theology in such a way that it reads like finely crafted novel.Furthermore, his theological insights are spot on. I may be sympathetic, because his theology seems increasingly more Lutheran as the years go by. By this I mean he is still on the Protestant side of things, but thinks liturgically and squarely out of the catholic tradition. He is the Kathleen Norris of the clergy.This book will work wonderfully as an introductory text for any class you are teaching to introduce people to the Bible. It is also simply enjoyable to read, and I commend it highly."
5,Created an Insatiable Appetite for More in me -,Renew your appetite for the written word.A must read.
2,The Scream Museum,"I thought the Scream Museum was a slow, boring book. I wouldnt really recommend it to anyone, unless they really like those suspence books alot. It was about a boy, P.C Hawke, who dreams of being a detective. When there is a murder at the Museum of Natural History, where his father works, he jumps on the case. Tom, who is the custodian at the musuem, is accused of the murder but P.C knows that Tom wouldnt hurt a fly. He along with his best friend, Mackenzie, try to find the real murderer and prove Tom innocent. They believe that it must have been one of the two co-workers who are now fighting for the womans job. Can P.C and Mackenzie prove Tom innocent?"
5,About This Book,"Posthumous collection of photographs. Part of the Photofile Series, which was founded to present the work of the world's greatest photographers in an accessible format, with the highest standards, at an affordable price.

3,Some good suggestions... for $7,"There are few good ideas presented, but not many. The book doesn't explain why a certain sentence pattern would be powerful or useful in a particular circumstance. Some sentence patterns are similar or have similar function. The book emphasizes a lot on the correct syntax to create a certain sentence structure, which I consider unnecessary because I my grammar is not the problem. I guess it is OK for $7."
4,Pocket knife mania,"I found a cigar box full of old pocket knives in my mother in laws attic. I wanted to learn more about them and what they might be worth. This book answered that question easily while also sparking some interest in acquiring other similar knives of value. I would recommend it or ""Official Price guide to collector knives"" by Price to anyone wanting to know more about pocket knives they might have.What I didn't like about this book was the poor quality pictures and sketches for many of the knives, they were of copier type quality. But they were good enough for me to learn what I wanted to know."
4,Very funny!,"Ok, I admit it...I'm a closet Rob Schneider fan. His movies are just silly and fun entertainment and I love to laugh at them. Of all the Rob Schneider movies, I would rank this at #3, first being 'The Hot Chick', second is 'Deuce Bigelow'. It is definitely better than 'The Animal'. I was surprised that this was shelved for a couple of years yet 'The Animal' made it to the theaters? The scenes with David Carradine as The Master were a hoot!"
1,Two thumbs DOWN!,"What S**T! Do yourself a favour and buy its breathtaking sequel... ""THE Priest They Called Him The Life And Legacy Of Jack Dolson""... a masterpiece! This film is not only a book but a film! This film was made to be seen on Cable... God knows why? Watch out for its faboulus twist at the end! Anyway the orignal... ""Titanic"" is slow from the second it starts, gets better during the nudity scene but slows down all the way through. But when the Aliens arrive on the ship and the man gets explodes is the sadest piece of the film!"
1,we all know what happens.....,"why did it take 3hrs to tell this story.i could tell it in 2.2 minutes =maiden voyage of a self proclaimed unsinkable ship,bunch of snooty rich people abord suddenly are in danger because, oh my, the driver probably really was drunk and had too much courage in a bottle and thought he could ram a glacier like ""garrr, blasted glacier, get out of me way""boat sinks, thousands die.the end.the best part of this movie was when find reotardo diCrapio frozen in the water. haha"
2,"3D - not great, 3/10","I have seen DVD with 2D to 3D conversion.I have seen blu-ray with 2D to 3D conversionI feel that blu-ray players with 2D to 3D conversion did better job. They were consistent during whole feature film.In 3D movie, I feel many places cheap tricks used to convert 2D movie to 3D movie and DIFFERENT tricks, although the film producer might paid a lot money for that. The DIFFERENT tricks made the film looking horrible to me. I've very good 3D perception.For this movie, I'll prefer DVD or blu-ray with 2D to 3D conversion next time.Studio conversion of 2D to 3D is quite expensive, it used to be about $100,000 per minute. Sorry to say, I don't find it worth - it is OK for collection, not for viewing. The blu ray player 2D to 3D converters are doing consistent job giving better view.In comparison to 3D movies like ""How to train your DRAGON"", I'd give 3D version of Titanic just 3 out of 10. The 2D stands at 10/10."
5,there is hardly no words or breath for this movie!,"i couldn't stand the hurt in this movie. they realy out did thereselves,to feel love and strength and the real pain of titanic,this would be a movie to endure."
3,Kinda corny...,"I thought it was a good movie (I better think that, I saw it 4 times) but it got pretty ridiculous. I mean, there's so much empasis placed on the fact the Jack died, but who really cares? People say how they cried and cried when he died, but I can't understand that. I laughed when he died. The part that was really sad was when the band was playing ""Nearer My God to Thee"" and they showed the mother reading to her children in third clas. THAT was worth crying over. It was also way too long, and too predictable. If it's a love story, of COURSE he dies in the end, it's inevitable. And hey, guess what? THE SHIP SINKS! GET OVER IT! And another thing (yes, I'm just full of opinions), couldn't they find a better singer than Celine Dion? She looks and sounds weird.PS: I saw the movie 4 times because twice was at b-day parties, and one time, my friend wanted to go. END"
3,Not the best Best Picture Movie,"The special effects are unforgettable. The movie itself is not forgettable. But I don't think it should have been a Best Picture movie. This movie was definetely overrated at the time of release.However, the movie is enjoyable and somewhat likeable. Nothing more than that, though."
3,REviewing DVD NOT the movie,"First off I liked the movie. I do not like the DVD. When you consider how huge this movie was it is shameful that the only extras anyone could come up with is only one of the 7 or 8 trailers/TV Spots and some trivia in text format.Think about that for a minute. How many interviews, TV Specials and featurettes did you see when this thing came out? Where are they? No idea. All I know is they aren't on this disc; so if you're looking for extra footage or bloopers or even a ""Making Of"" short, do not buy this DVD.On the positive side, unlike the VHS, at least it is condensed to one disk without hurting the video or sound appreciably.Undoubtedly there will be a 2-3 disc Special Edition or Directors Cut at the 10th anniversary. You've waited this long, hold out till 2007."
4,"seriously, you hypocrites","Its not plausible that the country that made Titanic the highest grossing movie ever would now verbally bash it. I see that many viewers have given this movie 1 or 2 stars. I agree completely that it is probably not the best movie ever made, but it is still well made. DiCaprio and Winslet have good on screen chemistry and the supporting cast is also strong. This film is not deep in its themes and revelations, but it provides good entertainment value."
2,"great movie, bad dvd","i agree with another user's comments about this dvd: i love the movie (for me it's one of the best movies of the last decade), but i think this dvd edition is really really bad... it's not only that it doesn't have any extras at all: to add pain to injury, the video it's not anamorphic but letterboxed, so if you've a widescreen tv you'll have to zoom in the picture, losing quality. of course it's better than a vhs, but that's not the point with this kind of film... it's one of the worst dvd editions i've ever seen, period. but the movie is so good that you'll forget about this details when you start to see it!"
5,Brilliant !,"Titanic is by far the most compelling movie I have ever seen. Love can be so tragic at times, yet so wonderful. Titanic made me cry and laugh. Even after watching this flim, you still can not imgane what those poor people went though in the real tradgey. I give Kate Winslet and Jason Barry 5 *****"
1,Stupid,"I thought this was the most stupid movie ever made. Seriously. It made me cry a lot. But, maybe this was because my mom wouldn't let me out of the theater so I could get away from that monstrosity. I hated this movie. It had a cheap, not down-to-earth love (if you could call it love, more like a one night stand) story, and stupid ""special effects."" The only reason why I gave it one star was because it ended."
1,titanically awful,Can there ever have been a more 'made for television' piece of rubbish than this. Without doubt the must stomach- turningly cliched waste of good videotape it has ever been my misfortune to watch.And as for the oscars. Can there now be any credibility to these awards at all? I think not.
4,Titanic,"I would watch it again though, my son enjoys movies about sinking ships. I thought that the love story was nice."
1,It ws allright,"It was good, but the main character was sleeping somewhat. When the ship was sinkingit was very exciting. I would recommend the book . Some of the real facts were missing I have study this diaster very closely. Like I say it was good but not exact."
2,If you have nothing better to do than cry...,"This movie made me cry and cry. I don't know about you, but I don't enjoy becoming unhappy because I watched a movie. Although Titanic was a terrible event, there is no reason to make a million dollar movie about it just to make people unhappy."
2,Chic Flick Sinks,"I was told to see this by a girlfriend. It lost my interest after the Poker game(Thats early). I found Kate W. a totally unattractive woman, and just kept wondering if I was supposed to care about this suicidal loser (I was, we all are). It goes on and on and on. The ending REALLY REALLY blew chunks. I can't imagine anyone ever throwing a diamond into a pond let alone what the old prune does in this chick flick.Why 2 stars, you may ask? Well, when its sinking, its great special effects. People are spinning all over the place. This movie has 7 minutes of entertainment value."
5,The Greatest of them All,"This is the greatest movie ever made and I am so sorry so many of you don't appreciate it...oh well, your loss. There is no movie more beautiful or more watchable, ever. Just ask my VCR."
1,Horrible in every sense of the word,"I hate this movie, not because of some deep seeded hate for Leo whats his name. No i hate this movie for what it is. A POORLY written and acted movie. The characters are flat, the storyline is laughable. The plot makes me want to vomit. I've seen this movie twice, the only time i enjoyed it was the second when me and my friend made funny comments about each scene a la MST2K. This movie so overhyped and over rated it makes me sad to live in a time when a glorified piece of garbage can make so much money."
1,very dumb!,I really hated this movie!I like the old version of the titanic.The iceberg wasn't even real.I really thought this movie was stupid.
5,great movie,"i'd have to say, this was a fascinating movie experience. the story of titanic has always been one people crave info on, and i give snaps for the accuracy of the film and its characters. superb acting, although i'd like to have seen more of the other characters (such as tommy ryan. he was quite humorous). but all in all, the storyline was great and i think i've found a new favorite film."
1,The WORST DVD ever next to The English Patient.,"OMG!!!What the heck! One of the greatest movies of all time treated as the worst! A trailer. T.R.A.I.L.E.R. I'm collecting all the best pictures on DVD and I'm skipping this and The English Patient.If I had to get it I'd rather get the Special VHS Edition in the box.Don't get me wrong. This is one of the best movies of all time.James Cameron. I'll kill you if you don't release a special edition of this.""Like a thousand knives stabbing you""-Leo A.K.A Jack Dawson"
2,Unbelievable story,This story of a big ship getting sunk is plainly unbelievable. They should have thought about the plot better before setting out to film the movie. Why write the story in such a way that the ship sinks and everyone dies? It would have been a better love story if the ship had just plainly reached its destination and had a happy ending. Just my 2 cents.
3,deceptive quality,"I bought a ""Very good"" used copy of Titanic from this seller that turned out to be absolute crap. It arrived in due time. The packaging was in tact. The case shell was perfect and the included scene guide was flawless, as was the DVD...upon surface level.I tried to play the movie 7+ times yet it kept routinely pausing and permanently jamming a little over a minute in. I tried to seek past the first minute or so of the film but couldn't even do that as it kept remaining stuck. The ONE time I successfully managed to seek past the jam point, it played for about 5 minutes but featured pauses on and off throughout before, once again, jamming dead still.On a positive note, I contacted the seller and reported the flaws. In my request for a refund, they sent me another copy instead. The second was flawless..."
1,The worst film of the history,It's the worst film ever shoot in the world!!!! It's a so stupid story!! It's a film only made for 12 year-old girls!!! If they want to watch a guy naked they just have to rent a porn...
3,Differences of Opinion,1st time you see it: Whoa!2nd time: What's the point?Buy it on video only if you must.
1,This is the worst movie ever conceived,"I was hoping for more blood. More gore, I mean there's gotta be sharks in them thare waters. Plus, you dont fall off a mile long ship thats straight up in the water, hit a damn pole on the way down and not have a arm or leg detach. I hate this movie more than life itself."
1,Non Historic,Titanic was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting was pitiful and so was the plot. The only relationship between this movie and what really happened is that the ship's name was Titanic and it sunk. If you want to watch somthing historically accurate than watch one of the documentaries. If your out to see a poor movie and a little bit of pitiful romance than go watch Titanic.
5,This is a great first-time DVD!,"This is an all-around great DVD. With Dolby Digital and Scene Selections, it is great! I have watched this on my computer alot lately, and it never gets old! Leo and Kate are great and they are super actors. Cool DVD! Don't go into scene selection and choose, ""The Drawing""! If you know what I mean!"
2,"Oh,my dear.....it's PG-13!!!!!","Surely,I won't let my 14-years-old sister watch this! Nudity,profanity,chilling corpses...it contains in intense degree.What happens to flim industry today??They expect Titanic to be perfect entertainment for everyone in family? If so,Scream and 13th Friday deserve PG-13,too. Besides,soap-opera love story is terrible."
1,NOT WORTH IT!!!!,words can explain how bad this movie is. total waste ofmoney....the money could have been burnt instead and would be worthmore....just my 2 cents
1,I want fact not fiction!,"Titanic may have cool looking special effects but other than that it's just a waste of time. it starts off with the fictional love story between a guy named jack and a girl named rose. and when you watch it unfold you get a been there seen that type of feeling which you have throughout the movie. Also, the movie didn't focus on the real people that died or lived through the sinking of the titanic which people would like to see & learn more about. I say just watch the second tape or watch terminator 1&2 or the abyss that's james cameron at his best"
1,The most overrated film of all time,"Titanic is completely overrated and is stupid. One of the main things that ruins this movie is it is pretty obvious what is going to happen. The ship is going to sink and one of them is going to die. Like we didn't know. The plot is nothing new. <Didn't NBC air a movie called ""Titanic"" a few years ago in which the plot was similar?> The acting is horrible. With the exception of whn the ship sinks Kate and Leo provide no drama or suspense. This scene is the only ""exciting"" scene in entire the film. Titanic is nothing more then a boring 3-4 hour soap-opera."
1,Please read this if you liked Titanic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"There is nothing in this film but a shallow, maudlin attemptto make you cry. The ending produced no emotion in me whatsoeverexcept bewilderment at how such banality could be made. Those who call this the most touching movie ever have obviously never seen a film with such emotional power as The Rules of the Game (1939). Let me recommend one of my favorite films in lieu of Titanic. If you want to experience a film with a compelling drama that climaxes by giving you a surge that not only brings sudden tears but also a heart flutter, watch Zinnemann's The Search (1948). There is nothing like it on al of cinema- it's on my top ten list."
2,3 Hour Movie-2 Hour Waste,"This movie had one of the worst plots I have ever seen. You can tell right from the start that it will end in tragedy, but James Cameron drags the already thin plot out over two hours before the real action even begins. The only thing that saved this movie from total disaster were the effects, and even they were a tad fake at times. I also think that it's somewhat depressing to see James Cameron spend so much money to make a blockbuster out of one of the most horrible disasters in history. You have to ask yourself, ""Where's the respect for the hundreds of people that died that night in 1912?"""
1,Awesome in 3D,It has two disc in 3D. The movie was very well done. We had a problem with the 2nd disc. It stopped just before the ship went down. Had to restart and some of the movie was not there. Will have to send back.
4,Almost a great movie,"The movie had incredible visual effects and really pulled the audience into the tragic events building up to the sinking of the Titanic. It could have been the one of the best epic films in history if not for the hollywood morals exhibited by the main characters. I felt they were terrible role models for younger people -- displaying the sort of flash-in-the-pan lust that typifies most movies today. The real emotional impact came from the love shown by the man on the deck of the ship saying good-bye for the last time to his wife and children as they boarded the lifeboat; the older couple holding each other in their arms while the ship was sinking; and the mother reading one last bedtime story to her young children as she tried to ignore the inevitable. All of these visuals made a deep and lasting impression on me of the true love that people share for one another. This was a good, but not a great movie. END"
1,THE MOST OVERRATED FILM IN THE HISTORY OF CINEMA!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I actually had to watch this stupid film and wonder why so many people liked this horrible movie that it makes my stomach turn. It was either that women wanted to see DiCaprio, the moviegoing public wanted to watch horrible stupid and miserable acting, the special effects that hide the film's awful flaws, or the awful love on the tradgedy of the great Titanic. I advise you not to even watch this film ever and I mean EVER for it's unsympathetic storyline, harsh reality, and stupid characters doesn't deserve the fame. Cinema has lost it's leap of faith!"
2,I'm probably going to get lots of hate mail for this...,"I finally got the DVD in the mail today and I was less than impressed. Here are my problems with the DVD. The movie itself is split into 2. I thought the creation of the DVD was to have the whole movie on one disc. The VHS of Titanic was two tapes. It's the 21's century. Now people are going to argue this point with the ""The alternate ending is on the second disc!!"". Then what is the 3rd disc for? All of the special features should have been on one disc. The other featuretts really didn't astound me. They were short and rather boring. If the special edition wasn't so cheap I would have just gotten the regular DVD and probably would have been much better. On the other side of the spectrum, the movie itself is fantastic! Minus the having to get up mid way to change the disc. Titanic is my favorite movie and features my favorite actor and actress. I reccomend the movie, but not this edition of the movie. Not worth it."
3,This sucks.,"As happy as I am that there's finally a Special Edition, I can't say I'm not upset about this, too. Back in March at an AMERICAN press conference, James Cameron confirmed that there were going to be two Special Edition DVDs released. A 4-disc version and a 2-disc version. After searching everywhere I can think of after seeing this on here today, the only conclusion I can come to is that the 4- and 2-disc versions are European releases and this is the only Region 1 version. I really want to be able to get the 4-disc version, but I can't if this is true. All I can say is that hopefully the Region 1 4- and 2-disc editions (Deluxe Collector's Edition and Special Edition, respectively) just aren't listed anywhere yet."
5,Great addition to our collection,Product came in great condition. Present for my wife. At first I was sceptical about the 3D but it really did come out great. Any Titanic lover should have this as an addition to thier library.
5,TITANIC,Its really good the effects are wonderful and the ship lookedMAGNIFICENT!!!!!!!The acting was also wonderful.Its worth MUCH more then 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!
3,An epic monument...to something...,"It is huge. It is unstoppable. It is a force of nature that humbles the greatest works of man. It looms above us in icy grandeur, but its greatest force lies hidden beneath the surface. See James Cameron's epic and moving tribute to the greatest force of nature: James Cameron's ego."
5,IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED.....,"ALL IT TAKES IS TWO... TO CREATE AND SUSTAIN THE LIFE OF A FAMILY, THE GARDEN OF DELIGHT OR THE INFALIBILITY OF A HUMAN MADE DEVICE. THANK YOU FOR THIS REMINDER AND FOR DISPLAYING YOUR TALENTS AND OMNISCIENCE FOR HUMAN VISION. WITH YOUR GREAT SKILL OF MOVIE PRODUCTION AND DIRECTORS ABILITY WE SHALL HAVE THIS TOKEN OF YOUR GREATNESS DURING YOUR ACTS OF CREATION AND YOUR INHEARANT ABILITIES TO PROJECT THE TALENTS OF THE CAST AND TECHNICIANS TO LIVE AS LONG AS VISUAL IMAGES TITALATE THE HUMAN SENSES."
1,I must have never been young enough to appreciate DiCaprio,"It's been a long time since I was 10 years old, but I can never remember liking an irritating pansy like Leonardo DiCaprio. I surely HOPE no one older is impressed by him!!I would much rather have watched a half-hour of the sinking of the ship. The movie sunk much earlier."
1,Everyone stops for the accident on the side of the road,"Why was Titanic so popular? One word: disaster. Sure, the special effects were well done, but the plot was lame, the acting mediocre, and the theme song makes me want to slit my wrists.Titanic was popular because everybody wants to see the big, realistic disaster. We are fascinated by death and this movie is a very realistic portrayal of death on a catastrophic scale.And if you still think Titanic really beat Star Wars in ticket sales, think again; A movie ticket was under $5 in when Star Wars came out. Titanic may have grossed more money, but it still didn't sell as many tickets.Spend your three hours watching a different movie or reading a book."
1,What a waste of money,"This movie is horrible. That's right, horrible. ... The movie hardly describes the event correctly, and it does not honor the hundreds who died that night. All it focuses on is sexual relationships between a criminal and a woman who would be a criminal if it weren't for the fact she came from an upper-class family. And let's not forget the adultery it potrays. There's only tradgedy, and it's not the one it should be: crimal dies, adulterer cries. Horrible movie. What a waste of money."
2,Two Mall Rats Flee a Sinking Script,"I agree the special effects, sets, costumes and soundtrack are impressive, but after those, what is left? For one, the dialogue is about as shallow as the Atlantic is deep. When Jack Dawson (DiCaprio) is first told the ship has struck an iceberg, all he can say is, 'Hey, that's not good....' Jack and Rose speak like two mall rats of the 1990s, and their oil and water chemistry was not convincing. Jack, for one, is so chipper that he needs to be doused with cold water -- and is. Most of the other characters are stereotypes, with the only heartfelt performance turned in by Gloria Stuart as the elderly Rose. In short, Jack and Rose's romance just didn't seem authentic. My expectations sank before the ship did."
2,Not as great as it was at the cinema,"OK, first of all I don't understand why this movie got so much attention, I mean, at the cinema it was like... Oh.. wow... great... stunning, but when I watched it at home, it was not as fantastic as I remembered it being, in fact, I am now ashamed that I actually have it! Kate Winslet is a really fabulous actress and she does a fantastic job, but... no this movie is NOT something I would have recommended. If you want a STUNNING film, a romantic film, I highly recommend ""A room with a view"", it is simply stunning!"
2,Leonardo DiCaprio=bad actor,"Leonardo brought this review down a lot. He CANNOT act and he doesn't look old enough to be Kate Winslet's lover. There are lots of good people that could be Jack. By the way, he's not king of the world!"
5,Great,Everything it said it would be. I love this movie. Good quality. I really liked that it came with Four discs. Good buy for the price.
5,classic,my favorite movie of all times. and leo is excellent. you cant help but love him. id go down with the ship for him
1,AN ABOMINATION!,"Ok mouth breathers...so you think this is a good movie, huh?! There are about 1200 reviews for this movie. They are all to be dismissed! Here is the TRUTH: James Cameron is a ... This movie is brain-dead. And it's fans have the mentalities of ... ..."
5,Great movie,This is a great movie which is going to become a great American classics movie. This is a good movie to watch as a family. We will and have watched this movie many times.
3,"long, overrated, big budget nightmare","yes it's james cameron, and big budget but it's too long, and the story could be set anywhere, not just the doomed ship the Titanic. anyway, i was not thrilled but had to give it some stars just for the effects and not altogether horrible acting. after all, it had cathy bates."
2,Movie for girls,"James Cameron put together a nice movie for girls. Rich ladies falling in love with tramps looking like Leonardo Dicaprio and silly stuff like that. Everlasting love within seconds after boy and girl meet for the first time. After half an hour any male viewer will start screaming for the iceberg to show up.I have got to hand it to James Cameron, that everything looksquite realistic. Too bad the love story is ruining that part as we find Leo and Kate walking through 0 degrees water longer than even a polar bear would be able to. However this movie became an enormous blockbuster, so let's not be too negative about it. (SARR)"
1,"Academy, were you paid off by Cameron?","OHHH NOOO!!! First of all, L. A. Confidential was a bazillionmillion times better than this overlong schmoltzy movie. I can'tbelieve this lousy piece of crap got what, nine academy awards? This shows how the money it made at the box office can earn academy awards. However, most of that money was adolescent girls seeing it 8 times or more. First, Leo is very much a boy from the late 1990's dropped into the 1910's, and it doesnt work. Second, it focuses on this love story that is somehow irritationg and rings very false. If the movie had focused more on the thousand people who died, it would have been better. But it treated this silly, annoying love story as more important than all that. I guess the only good performance was by Gloria Stuart, who was pretty good, perhaps good enough to deserve the Oscar she got. But, all in all, I don't know how anyone could see this lousy film more than once. And it was so LONG!!"
2,Not a classic !!,"Why all the hype? Just proves that oscars can be bought. The acting was less than average, with the odd exception (Kathy Bates was great), bad casting (Leo and Kate aren't convincing), and way too long. This movie had it's moments, although few, but did not deserve 11 oscars, especially not best picture. See it once, then forget it ! By the way, Celine Dion is awesome."
2,Not that great.,"The majestic special effects scenes of the Titanic itself is the only thing that saves this movie. Otherwise this is a totally forgettable movie. The acting has some moments of inspiration, but the scene when they're in the water is pathetic. I didn't even feel cold - there was no communication of the actual event. I think the fact that teenage girls made most of the money for this movie says it all. It's a love story with no depth, and good-looking actors that didn't make a huge effort at acting. Go see it once at the theater if you have to, but don't buy this DVD."
2,"Seems that ""good"" movies can be really bad.","I have realized that this movie is considered a ""winner"" In my opinion, it is mediocre. Kate Winslet's acting was very dry and Leonardo DiCaprio always seemed that he needed something new to talk about. The dialogue was plain and boring. Although the special effects were outstanding, the movie lacked in what should of been the strong points. The acting and dialogue in this movie made ""Bride Of Chucky"" seem like a masterpiece."
2,Great Movie - Shame about the transfer,"The movie Titanic is one of those great movies of all time. I have a huge gripe with the quality of the DVD. It is worse than VHS! The resolution lines are clearly visible, and even though it is not anamorphic, it should have been way better than this."
3,"Original Special Effects : Everything Else Recycled,","""""Titanic"" is a spectacular roller coaster ride"". What is disappointing is the total lack of a plausible script. Does anyone really believe that a charcoal sketch could survive intacked for 70 + years in a safe in the wreck the Titanic? Has anyone ever heard of hypothermia? Does anyone understand that the sucking wash of the sinking Titanic alone would have drowned anyone hanging on to the stern in those last minutes.Also the movie is heavily derived from other films. Obviously earlier Titanic films such as ""A Night to Remember"" But what surprised me was the Second half of the film (DiCaprio, Winslet Love affair) is directly lifted from Michael Curtiz's ""SEAWOLF"" (1941) with minor changes to blend into Titanic first half. With $200 million budget + you would think Cameron and company could have done much better."
2,Waste of money,Yes it has a lot of features. Why split the movie to two discs?To me that is annoying. If they split it why not add the deletedscenes to the movie. Maybe then I could understand the split.A 2 disc set probably would have sufficed.
1,It figures...,"I lose a lot of respect for a person's taste when I hear them say ""I loved Titanic!"" I mean, please... Titanic? One exasperated moviehouse owner, dismayed at the movie's popularity and thus extended run at his theater, would actively encourage people not to come to the ""boat show"" so he could stop showing the foul thing. Wake up, people! Why does popular always have to be so stupid?"
3,It was OK.,"I liked it okay, and most of the things (Besoides the luv story) were true.Like a cook really was on the very end of the boat and familys were split apart, and even woman and children who were considered ""Lower Class"" died. THey did only have 1/2 as many life boats as they needed. It had some parts that could have been taken out, but all-in-all it was a good movie!"
2,alright,"The first half of this movie is really boring and unoriginal.The second half is interesting only because of the great special effects and they were only interesting in the movie theatre.additional note:The theme song for Titanic is really annoying, Celine Dion cant sing."
5,The Best Movie Ever Made,"I liked watching this great movie becuase it worth watching it. Great actors,music,picture and real story. The Love between two people made me think, what make Kate to go back to the ship while it... . Still I have no answer. 200 million movie, really worth watching. enjoy it"
1,Boring chick flick movie!,"I barely remember seeing this movie in the theater and the point of this movie was is seeing the annoying Leo's face through the whole movie and having teenage girls screaming at him which gets annoying too. Awful special effects, bad DVD, and really not worth watching. It maybe good if your a girl and have a huge crush on Leo but really it's not my type of movie. Pearl Harbor was even worse but anyways don't waste time watching this movie it's just a stupid chick flick."
1,"I'm Sorry I Didn't Make You A Better Movie, Folks","Pure schmaltz. Cheap romance, pathetic dialogue and special effects that look like cartoons. I am certain James Cameron used subliminal hypnosis to convince the public to shower him with billions. I know I'm the only one who disliked this movie. I just had to speak up. Thanks for the use of the hall."
5,Best Movie of All Time!!!!!,"I love everything about the Titanic and being able to have the movie in DVD, Blu-ray, and Digital format just means I can take this fantastic movie everywhere I go!!!"
4,This movie is great except Leonardo,"This movie is really good. The special effects are great except for the role of Jack Dawsn played by Leonardo DiCaprio, why didnt the movie makers get a better actor than him. But i still liked it."
5,Excellent motion picture,"By far the best Titanic Motion Picture!At this point in the review process it would be pointless to tell you about this movie. So many other reviewers have already done it pretty darn good.However, I can tell you that I wholeheartedly enjoyed this motion picture. An absolutely great picture that is a must see.If you haven't seen this picture, then you should. This is a movie to own!"
1,Lame love story,"I thought the love story was really lame. Leonardo de Caprio and Kate Winslett just can't act to save their lives. ANd they really didn't seem to go well with each other.I will say one thing though, the cimemotography was beautiful. For all of you who didn't care for the dialogue and acting like myself, I recommend seeing this movie without any volume...you'd be surprised how much better it is without listening to Leo and Kate's obnoxious lines.,,"
3,"Titanic, schmitanic!","I'm glad that damned Titanic craze was over and done with once and for all after a year, so why are people still saying that this is the bomb-diggity? I definitely don't think so. Leonardo DiCaprio's most recent movie, ""The Beach,"" reportedly had him sunk again, and this time there was no boat! I also heard about his affair and that child he's having with his French co-star. He ain't the king of the world no more. Neither is James Cameron.Yeah, it made over a billion dollars, and that Céline Dion song which became a megahit, it isn't the best song in the world, though Céline, regardless of what many people think, has class and plenty of vocal talent, and the song is okay, too. I'd go with Bette Midler's ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" or Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston's ""When You Believe"" any day of the week, though. And the dialogue is Power Rangers-esque tripe. Not to mention way too much fiction.My recommendation: get ""Gone With The Wind"" instead."
2,titanic- only for dates its too much of a chick flick,"this movie was not so good it is one of the longest and mos boring movies i have ever seen. i have seen real life documentarys on the titanic and they were much better(well... except for old Kate.)its long extremely long, so unless you have a really good date or you can stand 3 hour boring movies i recomened you dont see it. Kate and Leonardo are both good actors but this movie will bore you and make you forget whos in it. the sinking of the titanic is a tradegy but dont give us this movie."
4,Great entertainment!,"I have one question for future trivia buffs -- how many times does Rose say ""Jack"" in this movie? After I watched it for the 3rd time, it occurred to me that about 70 percent of Kate Winslet's dialogue consists of her saying ""Jack"" -- ha! Loved it. END"
4,Titanic in 3D,"This was a great movie to view in 3D, Blu-ray. A friend who watched the movie with me said, ""When the Titanic sinks, you get wet."" All the details of the movie are so clear, in beautiful color. It is a thrilling experience (if BEING on a sinking ship can be described as such)."
3,Reviewing Reviewers,"This movie isn't even out on 3d blu-ray yet and people are reviewing this movie. How can you review something that isn't even out yet? Don't think seeing it in the theater is the same thing as the disc. the theater and home are 2 different experiences. Unless some of these reviews are down by people who have something to game by it. Maybe I might review part 2 of this movie tomorrow, years ahead of time."
1,Flat as a pancake,"I was almost 16 when I first watched this film, and I understand the story very well, and I still found it to be painfully long. The scenes of fe-male toplessness crossed the line into sickening. That this film broke the billion-dollar record at the box office is a sign of the Apocalypse. This film is the biggest visual disgrace to color films since Heaven's Gate."
1,Titanic,"Titanic is a long, boring bomb of a movie that was grossly over-rated. The acting is abominable. The subplots about the personal affairs of several passengers are an annoyance to watch. They are not believable as to what some people were doing with their time as their lives were in peril. They detract from the real event, the sinking of the ship and circumstances that led to its happening. Kate Winslet is a lousy actress and is tiring to watch. The one good feature of the movie is the actual sequence of frames of the sinking of the ship, which are well done."
5,Best collection!!!,"This is my all time favorite movie. I could write an entire thing of why and disprove the hate on it, but I'm gonna talk about the box set.It comes in an amazing box, looks and has a great feel. It opens from the top revealing the case with an amazing slip cover. The slip cover artwork is my favorite of any release of this movie. There are neat little added things from artwork of the consumes to news from the time.The box is sturdy and feels like it holds together and not cheap.The 3D is very well done and not annoying to where it takes away from the movie. It adds to certain scenes while others not as much. But any case of 3D or not, this collection is amazing and is worth the buy"
3,I think Libby Gelman-Waxner said it best...,"...the love story in this movie is like giving Anne Frank a wacky best friend in the attic to make the story ""more interesting."" Or words to that effect.I would rather have seen a broader storyline encompassing more of the real people on the ship (Molly Brown, John Jacob Astor, Isidor Strauss, etc.) than the saga of fictional Jack and Rose. That having been said, however, I must add that the special effects are superb.Between those two things, it comes out to an ""average"" review."
1,Oh please,"This is so realistic. An old lady still deeply in love, with some kid she spent one night with more then 70 years ago. Does this not make sense to everyone. I mean she only had a husband and family, 'course she'd still remembers the guy. Let's see other problems? Too many horrid acting for one (Leo's best scene was when he looked like a frog sinking down down down...) The only good actor was the computer generated one who bounced off the propeller. Don't waste you time."
2,The most over-rated film ever,"The love story was little unbelievable and DiCapprio's final scene made my sides hurt laughing in how corny and cliched it was. The entire script was just stupid. Cameron knows how to direct special effects, but he cannot write. Nor can he get universally good performances. Some were good (Winslet's, Stuart's), some were mediocre (DiCapprio's), and some were just horrible (Zane's--I kept waiting for him to grow a moustache so he could twirl it evilly like in the stage melodramas) The effects saved it from being a disaster, and there were some good moments. But 11 oscars? Gimme a break!"
2,Why all the hype?!,The plot was horrible in Titanic. The only impressive thing (which saved it from a one star rating) was its special effects.
2,"Cliched, substance free fluff for pubescent, hormonal set","The movie looks great, and the scenes depicting the struggle ofpassengers towards the end of the movie are touching and pathetic.However, this ""Titanic"" is ultimately a disappointment. After viewing it, one can spend hours thinking of ways Cameron could have made the movie better. The story is puerile. The characters are 90's cliches. That this movie won an Oscar indicates just how big of a joke the Academy Awards have become. Buy ""A Night to Remember"" instead."
2,Overrated,"This is one of the most overrated movies of all time. The plot goes at a snail's pace, filled with little romantic quips and cliches. The first two hours of the movie are completely unnecessary. By the time anything exciting happens, you don't care. Titanic was a good idea, but failed in it's execution. Just another Hollywood hype."
3,a very slow movie,"This movie lags in many places - after the ship sinks, for instance, Jack and Rose are just shown casually conversing in the chilly waters for what seems like an eternity!! The iceberg looked fake to me and DiCaprio seemed pretty lame in his role as Jack. Winslet was terrific as always."
2,Not Happy,I have purchased items from Amazon in the past and have always been very happy with the condition in which they arrived and the quality of the product. This is the first order I have received that I was very displeased with. The DVD came in the mail with a broken case and 1 of the 2 discs missing. The condition ordered was 'Like New' and it definitely did not come in that way. I am very dissatisfied.
3,"Not A Must See, But Definitly A Rent",I have always been a fan of Kate Winslet and when Titanic came out I went to see it 3 days after it's release. And I was very disappointed in it. For 1 the story seemed to focus more on DiCapreo & Winslet than the storyline. And being a fan of Growing Pains too I thought DiCapreo & Winslet would shine instead I don't see how either got an award for it. If I had known it was like this I would of rented it and saved some money. Also I think after this James Cameron & Leonardo DiCapreo gloated way to much!
5,Excitment,"Same story but the screen quite different than the but which is not 3d, cool. If you like this movie I will recommend you to get it."
4,Truly One of the Most Expensive Movies Ever Made,"I gave this film 4 stars for its beautiful production values. I wish a good script came with the movie. While the script may have won an Oscar, it must be one of those great mysteries. No adult in this movie speaks at a higher level than your average 15 year old. No matter how old they are. The bad man is Snidely Whiplash's younger brother and a Degas and a Picasso went down on the ship. Still, the special effects and the disaster of the Titanic are extraordinary and I did cry at the end. So it comes out to a draw. I know of many movies which are better and many which are worse."
2,passable dreck,"One of the most technically amazing efforts in cinema attached to the most horrible pulp screenplay ever. It was manipulative and drawn-out to tell me howto feel about it, instead of allowing me to become involved and create emotional reactions on my own."
2,"The first time was okay, but the rest was horrible.",It was an extremely sad plot. See it only once. I have it and saw it at least 50 times. I feel as though I should be sick.
2,Every comment counts! Be open-minded!!,Don't assume those who don't like Titanic are weird or insensitive.I cried when watching sinking scene and people dying..but..many scenes were so annoying and ridiculous that I couldn't sit still watching them.And Academy Awards really prove something? NO.I've seen many brilliant movies that not even be nominated.Titanic is very overrated and I'm not surprised why some people hate it.
3,Once is more than enough,"I went to see ""Titanic"" in the theater like millions of people. I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio was cute and Kate Winslow was charming. I felt goosebumps when Jack screamed: I am the king of the world! and felt sad when he finally....well, you know. Great effects, beautiful wardrobe, but pleeease: How many times can you see that ship sink. I believe that once is more than enough; maybe in ten years we could see it again on T.V. Meanwhile, you should buy ""Casablanca"", a movie worth seeing a thousand times"
3,IT WAS OK I GUESS,I guess it was ok but it got really boring.There are better movies out there people and I would NOT recommend this to anyone.
1,Ugh.,"The only big hit movie that was worse than this is TWISTER. If you liked TWISTER, you may like TITANIC."
5,oopsies !!!,"well, while watching this one the TV, i came across a mistake that must have been made by the prop guy. There is a scene in which Jack hands Rose a yellow slip of paper, and when he leaves, she opens the letter. But when she takes out the note again, its colored white!! also, does anyone realize that Rose's mole keeps switching from the left side of her mouth to the right side of her mouth?"
3,The sinking was good...,"The special effects were quite good as the ship went down, but the unlikely love story was contrived and unconvincing. Leo is miscast big time as Jack. With the sappy love story between him and Kate Winslet, I anxiously awaited the sinking of the boat.Best picture of 1997? Yeah, right!"
5,ONLY 4/12 STARS?,"Jeez you people, those who rated this movie 3 and below are CRAZY! It's a wonderful touching romantic story while taking place in a tradgety. It was very well directed if anything! Buy this movie!!!!!!!!!!"
1,[sound of me projectile-vomiting at nearest copy of tape],"I have never seen this movie, though I feel as though I have due to all the damnable previews, music videos, awards, and just general idiotic ranting about how great it was. If I ever break down and watch this atrocity, you all have full permission to SHOOT ME! And if I catch ANY of you listening to that damn Celine Dion song, I'll shoot YOU! This thing is worse than a Mickey Roonie flick! All of it's patrons make me hope for nuclear holocost! Please oh please, somebody just analy rape the whole cast and crew with a large spiked chunk of wood so they NEVER make a sequal! I swear, if I see one more goddamn trailer for this thing, I'm buying a semi-automatic assult rifle and heading for the top of the nearest tower!"
5,Theater quality.,"Bought this edition as I had been waiting for years for it to come out, and I was not dissappointed. Looked better on my 3D TV than I remember when it was re released as 3D in the theaters. (Seemed more grainy, lost some color and light values). I got the box set to share with others that were pleased also, and the extras fed my interest in this tragic/romantic event."
1,Tasteless bunch of crap,"If James Cameron wanted to honor the victims of Titanic, he would have observed 196 more minutes of silence. For those of you who can't figure that remark out (the average Titanic fan, I assume), I mean that the movie is a (subject line) which exploits a tragedy by adding a fictional, impossibly cliched romance in a grand marketing scheme. Fans come to us(Anti-titanic crusaders0 and say we have no respect for those who died. Of all the gall. People, it didn't happen, it couldn't have happened, You don't need to pay 29.95 for this END"
1,Too Much Hoopla Over Cheesy Movie!!,"I hated this movie!! It was long and had cheesy dialogue. While I did appreciate the technical aspect of it such as the scenery, cinematography, special effects,etc. This movie had no clue what to do with its main character Jack. Was he supposed to be a nice guy, a hero, or a jerk? The script was poorly written. The writer had no clue what to do after each scene. What's the deal with the gun chase?? Where in the world did that come from? This is just a cheesy romance movie disguised as an epic about two lovers on the ill-fated Titanic. I am a movie buff and Titanic seemed like too much of a formula film."
1,An Atrocious Waste of TIme!,"TERRIBLE. I went to the theaters to watch this film, and could not wait for it to end. A terrible rehash of a cliched love story sold only by its special effects. This film is not worth ten minutes, much less three hours! Nothing can save this film from being placed on my list of WORST CINEMATIC EVENTS OF ALL TIME. Its difficult to believe that in an age of such movie diversity, this title could be so highly recommended and praised. I must say that even my fiance, who enjoys romance films, thought Titanic was a monumental disappiontment. With all the great romances available, leave this one on the shelf and spend your money on somethign worhtwhile. I gave this film one star, although it is considerably lower than that!"
5,It's a brilliant movie!,"""Titanic"" is an excellent movie from director James Cameron. DiCaprio and Winslet make a great couple in this movie that always keeps you in suspense! Did you know that ""Titanic"" is the most popular movie of all time?"
2,"Nice effects, but the story and dialogue was awful","The good news is the effects and the costumes were wonderfully done. I was so distracted by the sappy and stilted dialogue though that the movie was painful for me to watch, I kept thinking ""this is acting?"" I've seen high school plays with more convincing characters. I did not find anything in the storyline that made me think, made me question, made me feel especially touched, which I think the movie had a potential to do if the dialogue and acting were done at a higher level. Certainly a nice teenage date movie, but because of it's lack of feeling, humor, intelligence or originality, not a movie I think deserved near the acclaim it has received."
2,dialogue,"""Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack!"" ""Rose, Rose, Rose, Rose!"" ""Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack!"" ""Rose, Rose, Rose Rose!"" ""Jack!"" ""Rose!"" ""Jack!"" ""Rose!"""
4,Disc 3 Is Where The Real Value Is At...,"This collection was the first I have seen in so long after the first DVD release to introduce all of the deleted scenes and alternate ending. Many of them are available on Youtube now, but this is certainly a collector's item. Disc 3 is really the gem in this set with all the extras, special features and really getting to dive into the making of this film. My father originally gave me this set when it was released years ago but after recently giving it away to a friend I decided I wanted a copy again for myself. For the Titanic collector, this is a perfect gift and a great keepsake."
2,It Is Loud,"Feels solid and looks well constructed. Small form factor. Power cable fits nice and snug. There's a 2A fuse on the underside covered by a rubber cover. I think you need pliars to remove it b/c I was unable to with my fingers. When you plug in the APV12US the internal fan turns on and is VERY loud. Only a lot of road noise and music will mask the sound. [I previously owned a Xantrex XPower 175 Inverter and it was completely silent. Loved it, but it only has one 3-prong plug.] I bought the APV12US with the intention of using the EmPower connection on an international flight. The two 3-prong ports and USB port looked like nice options to have. Hopefully this unit will last, but seems like the fan might be the first thing to go.Weight: 13.5oz (384g)(I did not buy this from Amazon. Sorry Amazon, you were't the cheapest this time.)"
2,not very interesting,"The author uses personal records such as diaries and letters to add local color to this campaign. Overall the book does not turn much new ground.McClellan is, as usual, condemned as barely competent. For my two cents, McClellan is the victim of hindsight, and was a serious, effective man, though I have yet to read that in any popular Civil War history. Perhaps McClellan did overestimate the size of Lee's army, but he acted on the data that was provided him. Much like Admiral Jellicoe at the WWI naval battle of Jutland, he did not lose his force, and he held the field, and that was the essential strategic requirement.The book has a general point of view bias to the Union side. An OK read for someone unfamiliar with the campaign, but Civil War buffs won't find much new here."
1,A disappointment.,"This was my first book by this author and I am not encouraged to read more. It's not that I thought the author didn't know what he was talking about. It's that the book (and the reader) would have benefited from some brevity. If he'd just made his point and moved on, it might have been enjoyable. But then again the book was so short that brevity would have reduced it to a whisper. It looks like he was just filling pages."
1,McPherson Folly,"James McPherson has misconstrued the importance of the Battle of Anietam by asserting that its importance reached across the Altantic and influenced England and France not to aid the Confederacy. Queen Victoria declared in 1861 that England would remain neutral. Confederate Ambassador, William Lowndes Yancey knew before he left on his mission that the odds were against him. Southern cotton was no longer the only source for European mills. Egypt was already in the market.McPherson has tried to ""up the stakes"" by making claims about the importance of the battle to Lincoln's and European decisions that just are not so. He is just another northern writer trying to polish the ineffectual fighting image of the yankees, at the expense of the South."
4,A focus on contingencies,"I have always had a high opinion of Dr. McPherson, and he certainly doesn't disappoint with this excellent work. ""Crossroads of Freedom"" isn't a thorough examination of the Battle of Antietam. Instead, it is an expert look at the perilous condition of the Union prior to the September battle, and illustrates the critical importance of this engagement, and how it served as a turning point in both Civil War and American social/political history.Full of generalizations by one of today's most enlightened historians, this book is perfect for the Civil War enthusiast and novice alike; It simply puts the first few years of the war into perspective. Perhaps the most valuable facet of this work is the excellent bibliography and appendices that serve as an invaluable asset to further research in a variety of subjects."
2,A Great Magazine Article,"This would have made a wonderful magazine article but to call it a ""book"" is misleading. If you eliminate the maps, pictures and blank pages between chapters you probably have 125 pages of text. At its price, this is not a worthwhile investment for any civil war buff. While it is well written, it simply makes the case that Antietam was a pivitol battle. I think most people, who are somewhat informed about the Civil War, already knew that."
1,Extremely inappropriate,"My daughter was assigned to read this book in her 7th grade literature class. She showed the book first to my husband who thought it was borderline inappropriate after reading one page. Then I read several pages and couldn't believe that this book is available to 12 and 13 year old girls! After doing some research, I have found that this book has been banned in many schools in America and some have even called this soft porn."
4,Good book,"This book does a very good job of expressing all of the emotions of teenage love. ""What My Mother Doesn't Know"" is a novel of short verses, all written by the point of view of a 14-year-old named Sophie. In the book she tells about her first 3 loves. In this coming-of-age novel, Sophie learns the difference betweeen lust and love, and also learns that you can't always trust people, even if you think you love them. The poems are really well written. This book flows; I finished it in 2 hours. Make sure when you start reading this one you have plenty of time, because you won't want to stop. I think anybody who has ever either been in love or thought they have been in love can relate to most of this book, no matter what age you are or what experiences you have had. I really suggest that anyone reads this book, whether you normally like to read or not; you'll like this book."
5,What My Mother Doesn't Know,"Even though the set-up of the book is a bit funky (set-up like a poem even though it isn't) it is a great read! This book takes you through the eyes of Sophie with her 3 loves Lou, Dylan, and Murphy (a.k.a. Robin). This book shows a lot of issues that most teens face some are being accepted, popularity, and girls who are boy crazy. Even though this book is strange sometimes its a great read! I recommened this for girls ages 13-15 because there is some issues which people under 12 shouldn't read about until they are older."
3,"Better than the first, but...","This book was definitely better than the author's first. It was longer and obviously more sophisticated, but I still think it was just a little too shallow. She falls for this guy and rambles on for 50 pages about how much she loves him and then all of a sudden, she meets this guy on the internet and the other doesn't even exist anymore. She later dumps this guy and then after a long (not) period of soul-searching, she finally finds her true love in the guy she never expected to fall for and they live happily ever after. Blachhhh."
3,Okay...,"This book was okay, it wasn't that great however. Sophie - a sixteen year old girl writes in sort of a diary form about all the meetings she come in contact with diffrent boys. I didn't like it that much because she was portrayed as a little too boy crazy for me."
1,"WOW! Who would have known it was a book of ""poems""?!?","This book made me so mad!... This was a VERY quick read, with no tangible plot or deep charactarization. It was a book based on ""poems"" about her life. The poems themselves described what was going on, which is the main reason this book was so bad. The poems are boring and dry and offer little insight to the situations going on. I reccomend you do not read this book, unless you are keen on wasting your time."
4,What My Mother Doesn't Know,"What My Mother Doesn't Know is a wonderful book. I think that because I could really relate myself to the book. One of the main characters are Sophie. Sophie is a girl that goes to a party and starts to dance with this guy she named Robin. Robin is this really dorky guy that nobody likes and always bullies. So she tells her frieds about Robin, but she doesnt tell them his name because she doesnt want them to make fun of her. Then she doesnt see him anymore because of her friends. You will have to read the book to figure out if she starts to see him again or not. Also, if her friends ever find out it was Robin."
3,um...,"I don't really know how I feel about the poem form of this book. The poems were in a style where if you really got caught up in it, you could forget that they were poems and just read it like a regular book. But, the poems made it go by really fast. I was just really getting into the story and then it was over."
4,very good,"definitely a good quick read (only 1 hour). its cute and quirky and good with the mother daughter issues though it is not mentioned in the descriptions. A tad bit too sappy and sweet, though."
4,series of unfortunate events,the main idea of this book is there are three kids who are sent off to another distant relative. as they fight there way through count olaf and his disguises. yes count olaf is back in just one more of his evil disguises which didnt fool violet at first. my opinion is you read this book because it takes you to the world of the three orphans and how they fight there constant battles with count olaf and his many aliases.

3,What you don't need to know...,"The book centers around Sofie and her boyfriends and crushs, once in a while taking a diversion to take a peek at her realtionships with her best friends or her mother. The entire book is written in sort-of poetry form, which makes the reading faster and leaves the reader wanting more, as many facts are kept hidden.One word to describe this book? cute. It won't change your life, but if you're looking for a light read, consider picking up this book."
1,ARGHHHHHHHH,"Why do people like this book so much? The plot is very very cliche...and the shortness of the book only makes this worse because there is no room for it to develop a slightly unique plot...The characters didn't develop well and before I knew it, the book was already over. I spent 10 bucks on a book that lasted 30 minutes and was written in a poetry format."
1,What My Mother Doesn't Know,"I was offended that this book is written for 12 year olds and up. I don't think any mother would want her preteen, or teenager reading this book. It is extremely inappropriate for the lead character to be involved in any of the dating activities or internet conversations that were portrayed in the book. I know that as a mother of 2 teenage girls, I do not want them to think that what this girl was doing, or feeling is what they should be doing at this age. And we wonder why our teenage girls are becoming sexually active at a much younger age."
5,good book =],I really do recommend this book. I thought it was a great book. It really teaches girls that it really isn't looks in a guy that you should always go for. I would recommend it because it really is a good girl book and has a lot of lessons to learn in it. It also makes you want to keep reading on because it always keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. The book also teaches you how much you can have fun and how much you can have in common with a person you never would of expected. This book has a great ending you wouldn't exspect!
5,THis book was amazing!,I just read this book a couple of weeks ago and its amazing! I loved it even thought its in poem form the story is great! I think any 13 year old girl will love this book! If you like this book you should realy the Gossip Girl books there also amazing!Thanks!
4,Already within the text,"All cases in this book are already within the hardcover text. I wasted my money. The actual cases within this text are great ones though, because they really require the reader to think about several aspects of business."
2,Hisonic HS-668 Amplified Speaker,"I bought this unit as an external speaker for a shortwave radio. The units sound has to much bass when listening to Shortwave broadcast. The tone control does little to reduce to bass output. If you are listing to FM,it sounds great with lots of room filling sound. There is also a problem of noise when listening Shortwave. I think there is some inter-action between the amplifier electronics and my portable shortwave radio. My Two star rating has to do with Shortwave radio listening.Tony"
4,High Sierra Ravine water bottle,Very nicely made water bottle that attaches to your belt. I like the small side zipper pocket that was able to hold a granola bar. You can switch out the water bottle for a smaller one and still use the holder.
2,It is just ok,Not so impressed with the water bottle. I feel that it is too expensive for the quality. The holder probably cost more than the actual bottle. It is also not dishwasher safe.
4,school,"this book was for one of my college classes, it wasnt the correct version but it had most of the similar things as the newer edition"
1,NOT PLEASED,"I ORDERED THIS BOOK AND HAD TO RETURN IT BECAUSE THE 3 CD SET WAS NOT INCLUDED. I HAD TO PAY THE SHIPPING TO RETURN IT. THE DESCRIPTION SHOULD NOT OF SAID ""WITH 3CD""."
3,Minnesota Librarian,"I ordered three books from this series sight unseen because I have a fondness for Minnesota and because I live in a small town where I was once librarian. It seemed a great combination for this mystery fan. The book is well enough written. My problem is that I could not warm up to the heroine. I find it difficult to have patience with anyone who falls in love and has sex with someone she met only a few hours before. This might be generational, but I was irritated enough with the heroine from the start that I didn't enjoy the book."
1,TRYING TOO HARD FOR DEPRAVITY,"I thought this would be cute but with every character introduced, some form of disfunction was brought into the story. Can't figure out the author's motive but to say it was disappointing is doing it more justice than the story merits. Don't waste your time."
