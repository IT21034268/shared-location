2,Sort of cheaply made,"All the Simpson's trivia is fun, but the quality of the game is poor. Seems like it was made so cheaply so the Simpson's franchise could suck all the profit out of it. I read the other reviews and decided to buy the game only because of the buy one get one free offer. The spinner barely spins. I think I need to go buy a 10 sided dice."
2,Hasbro made this Edition ... the Origial was made by Milton Bradley,"After reading all the other reviews I noticed at the bottom other products people looked at...I did not realize until then that The Simpsons Edition is made by another company...Hasbro. Maybe that explains the difference in the quality that all reviews seem upset about. I have not check out to see if the current The Game of Life (still manufactured by Milton Bradley) is also as poorly constructed.I would not go out to purchase this game, however, it is a request on a child's Christmas list that we are to purchase a gift for in our family name draw."
5,THIS GAME IS GREAT!!!!!,"i am i big simpson fan, we boght simsons life and WOW!!!! we played it non stop it is totaly worth the money.... it is like life with the added fun of the simposns!!! i love that game!!!!!"
4,Incredibly fun... must-have for any Simpsons' fan!,"I love this Simpsons edition of the Life board game. It is hilarious and includes many small fun facs or direct quotes that a diehard fan like me remembers from the series. The first time I played it with my two smaller siblings, I couldn't stop laughing all through the game.As far as the gameplay goes, there are many nuances like buying a house, getting a job (depending on your level of education,) buying insurance for your car and/or house, all with humorous names (like Otto Insurance.) True Simpsons fans will understand this pun.The durability of this game is great! There is nothing to break in it. The tokens are plastic cars which couldn't be broken short of a direct nuclear missile hit and the game board includes plastic houses (like Springfield Elementary School, the powerplant, Burns' Manor, etc.) and only the money is likely to be crumpled during gameplay (especially with my kids.)Overall it's a GREAT game and I recommend it very much."
4,Entertaining,"I remember this movie from when I was a small child, and thoroughly enjoyed it.It was great to watch it again as an adult, and even though it is quite clearly dubbed, as the original was in Italian, its still entertaining, and a great kids film. Was lovely to watch it again after all these years."
5,fantastic!,"I've listened to my cassette tape of ""Talk on Corners"" so many times that I can clearly remember the way each song goes and know the lyrics to almost all of them. I've never loved an album so much as I love this one, and it's made me become a fan of the Corrs---I've been a fan for about a year or more now because of this album. It's great and it doesn't sound common---one thing I like when it comes to music is the uniqueness of the song. Totally relaxing and fresh, it is not at all a disappointing buy."
4,Latest Corrs CD different but still Corrs (lovely),"It seems clear that the Corrs, or their handlers, are trying to get this incredible band a bigger share of the American market, and found it necessary to put out the Reader's Digest version of my favorite, ""Runaway,"" but Andrea is such a talent that she pulls it off despite the cut corners on the lyrical and romantic touches the original had. I enjoy listening to this edition, but I'm glad I have ""Fogiven, Not Forgotten"" and hope to see more in that line in the future when my favorite band gets big enough to risk it."
2,Yuck!!!!,"This version is worst than their ""In Blue"" cd. Gosh, why can't people just be and stay true to themselves? This is the Corrs's first attempt to be ""Americans"" and that says it all. If you really want to hear them at their best, buy their first cd and their ""live"" cd, where their Irish culture and heritage shines through. But if you want to hear ""non-Americans"" try to be ""Americans"" and then fail, by all means this cd is for you."
4,They Get Better 2nd Time Around,"The Corrs seem to get better the 2nd time around. Although Forgiven was, no doubt, an excellent debut release, Talk On Corners-Special Edition offers up some nice up tempo remixes of thier tunes. All the remixes (only 4) and the remaining regular version tracks on this Edition are like ear candy, your ears want more. What is interesting is the version I got here in Canada has a different cover and has a toal of 15 songs on it not 12 like the USA version. All in all I recommend picking this cd up and thier other cd's (imports and domestics) because you sure will not be disappointed with what you hear. The Corrs are a combo of ear candy and eye candy. But without the sugar coating."
5,Wonderful timeless children's book,"I read this book about 45 years ago and still remember how muchI loved it. It is a beautiful story, whose ideas, relationships, themes, opinions, and manner of writing not too dated (like Rebecca of Sunybrook farm) ... about 2 little girls whose only real desire is a loving family ... but more like Lucy Maud Montgomery's ""Anne of Green Gables"", the Stratton-Porter books like ""Girl of the Limberlost"" or Frances Hodgson Burnett's ""The Secret Garden"". For slightly younger children (to read toKindergartner's and up). GET THIS BACK IN PRINT!!! Betty Macdonald also wrote humorous adult books .. I think ""The Egg and I"" was made into a very funny move about a city couple taking upfarming (with Fred McMurray and Claudet Colbert? ... pre-dating ""Green Acres"")."
2,No es gran cosa,"Este video es un video de ejercicios mas, lo unico que vende es que lo hace Claudia Shiffer"
3,Barbie boy dolls break easily,Every time I get a barbie men doll they break easily. The legs and heads snap off all the time. I think Barbie boy dolls are cheap. They would be ok if they didn't break so easily. I have bought 3 and all of them broke in just a few days.
2,I dislike this Product,"I was looking for a product that will be a comfortable fitting prouct, not a bunch of HARD ICE CUBES"
2,an okay movie,"i saw this one before i saw the first one and i thought it was the best movie i had ever seen but then i saw the first one and found it a whole lot better than this one.i still like this movie but,if your deciding which witchboard to get,get the first one and dont waste your time on this one."
4,Almost As Good As The First,The first one was a classic but this one is pretty good too. It's along the same lines as the first one about a woman being terrorized by a vengeful spirit who was contacted through a Ouija Board. It haunts the apartment and makes things go bump in the night. It becomes more and more vicious as it kills people by causing bizarre accidents. Then it begins to take over the woman's body by possessing it. Pretty scary stuff!
4,Smooth and silky,"I've had this CD about 3+ weeks now, and it's a very easy listen. Mr. James' breathy start-ups and smooth sound are in full force, but there's a decidedly funky edge to several of the cuts as well, which is , for the most part, also a Boney James trademark. This is just some simply good stuff to listen to after a rigorous day at work, lets you kick ack a bit, but keeps you listening to the fine work he does. Nothing to doze off to. Give it a try."
5,Love Boney James,"I think that this cd showed a softer side of Bone, nice and mellow. I think this is a must have cd for any collection. I am a big fan."
2,eh.,Mostly black and white. Got it to replace a better book that was a gift that got lost before it was given.
5,Longhorn Steering Wheel Cover,"I LOVE this product. I've looked for one of these everywhere. Walmart had them at one point for close to $30.00 and I got it for half that on Amazon.com and free shipping. It is a snug fit, (I have a Honda CRV) so it takes a little work to get it on, but you don't want a loose fit. Just follow the instructions on the package and you will work it on your steering wheel. I've had so many great comments from friends. It is very sturdy/thick material, arrived timely and was pkged well. I highly recommend."
4,Surprisingly good!,"When the blurb about this DVD says it has an all-star cast, it's not kidding. Each of these short vignettes has not one but several bona fide stars, from Cate Blanchette as a young woman coming unglued over dinner to James Gandolfini as a man waking up from a drunken stupor to find that his wife has left him and, quite literally, taken EVERYTHING. I have to admit that I didn't expect much at all from this DVD, in part because I'd never heard of it and in part because it came from the bottom of the bargain bin at Wal-Mart. However, it really is surprisingly good. The vignettes themselves are a bit uneven - my favorites were ""Standing Room Only"" (a wordless, nearly slapstick piece starring Hugh Jackman) and ""Euston Road"" (a short and clever tale of a down-on-his-luck gambler who isn't quite what he seems). Even if there are only a few of the pieces that you really, really enjoy, for the $5 used DVD price, you can't go wrong. Give Stories of Lost Souls a try."
4,"Jazzy, downbeat and moody","Joe Henry has now completely abandoned his folk-rock, alt-country roots. The songs here are more jazz than anything else. The album is more about subtle shadings of sound than songs. It's his most complex and inaccessible work, but will reward dedicated listeners. Overall, I like Henry's more song-based, pop-oriented material. I find this album to be a little ponderous and oblique for my tastes, but there is a level of musicianship is really jus beyond belief. Marc Ribot adds his distinctive guitar tones and the great Ornette Coleman even plays on some tracks. Ruben Blades adds vibes. The lyrics are also very intelligent an poignant. I don't know. I guess this album just hasn't ""grabbed"" me yet."
3,Fiddlesticks,These are hard for my 4 yr old grandson to keep together . He likes to put them together but frequently they fall apart. My grandaughter tries to make what is in the pictures but needs help . She is 6
4,Fun family project,My son and I have bonded building the Ferris wheel. We had fun and it looks and runs great. What I like about the Classic builder is that you have to think and follow directions.
2,"good idea, bad execution","Cuts good and performs well, initially. The ratcheting pieces constantly loosen, resulting in sloppy cutting. The nuts and bolts do not stay tight and therefore get lost while working. Keep your tools handy so that you can tighten the pieces about every hour. Its the typical stuff from China."
3,Bone Storage Bin,"Very cute with a tight lid but not very big. I put in 4 small stuffed animals and it was full. Probably better for smaller toys, clothes or treats.Might not recommend if have lots of toys or larger toys."
4,Good solid picks,"I ordered these because I wanted to try something new and a friend recommended these kinds of picks. I was amazed when I first plucked my first string on my guitar. These picks give off a sharp, clear sound.While they look cheaply made and the material is glossy, they are very durable (even after I tried to snap one in half).I am very impressed by these picks and I will be ordering them again once I use/lose all of these picks.My only gripe is that they are very slick and I sometimes lose grip on them."
3,Too Short,"Just received this DVD, haven't even watched it. There are only four (4) vids on the DVD - kinda short. I am a little disappointed with this. I enjoy Dennis's music & was expecting a few more choices."
1,Tested Positive for LEAD,"I bought these dishes at Ross 2 years ago. I really loved them for everyday dishes. Last week, I saw another review on Amazon, saying that her dishes tested positive for lead! I bought a lead tester and sure enough, this morning the dishes tested positive for lead in the glaze.We are shocked and devastated! I am getting rid of the dishes, of course. Lead is a very poisonous substance.I went and bought 12 white dishes from Pottery Barn this afternoon. I'm going to test them too! I am disappointed that Amazon is selling dishes with lead leaching from the glaze."
2,A lot of irrelevant parts,"This film is more like 20 minutes if you remove the shots of trees or people taking 2 minutes to walk to their gate. I guess this is the way they shot films in the 60's, a lot of extra unneeded stuff. Besides that you had to know the story before watching the movie. We had no history of the characters and there were a lot of assumptions. Not interesting, save your money."
4,A MUST-READ book for anyone interested in the ancient world,"Every possible reason why Atlantis once existed, why it has not yet been uncovered, and the extraordinary evidence of very advanced early civilizations..."
4,Great Set - shame about the Product Control Quality!,"I'll keep this short-and-sweet. For anyone who loves the Pink Panther, this is THE set to buy on DVD! It has almost everything you could ever want!Sadly, the set loses 1-star, because of the bad product quality control. 1) Although sealed in cellophane, discs in my set arrived with adhesive on the playing side of the discs. 2) The cover for Volume 2, has the spine labelled incorrectly as ""Pranks In The Pink"" instead of ""Adventures In The Pink"". 3) None of the slimline DVD cases are identical. All are different in terms of the way they open, the manufacturer, and the type of spindle the discs are held on! 4) Lastly, the cardboard outer sleeve is fractionally too big to hold the discs snug, and thus is likely to get squashed during transit!For such a great set, it's a shame that MGM's DVD Quality Control has been so awful with this particular release. I have contacted them about this, and eagerly await their response!"
3,Kind of suspicious....,"I find it hard to believe that there could be 17 reviews of this album and not ONE of them mentions the uncanny resemblance of this band's sound to that of Steely Dan. Furthermore, all but one of these reviews are anonymous and most of them are very short blurb-like remarks, not to mention that every single one of them gives the album 5 stars! It makes one wonder whether these ""reviews"" are possibly being supplied by people friendly to the band, at least.As a disinterested person, let me opine that this is a perfectly decent, well-executed smooth-jazz album, with several songs featuring Donald Fagen-like vocals. Admittedly, sounding so much like the Dan is no small feat, and there is not exactly a glut of new Steely Dan product being released, but it is tough to listen to one of the vocals and not be distracted by the similarity. If this doesn't bother you, then this album could be a reasonable purchase."
1,this game sucks,"This game lacks in almosst every subject you look or in a game. The plot is totally stpid and outraegous, he weapons dont have much of a range and the game has many glitches and laggs a ton. I would pay, at the most 3 dollars for this piece of shiit."
1,Misleading advertising,The ad displays a tan purse.After I purchased it then I found out it only comes in BLACK.My wife has decided she will use it this fall/winter.
2,The Dilana Track is good,This is a dud except for track 3 Black which features Dilana. Download that one and skip the rest of this
1,"So bad, it could only have been self-published","My first clue how bad the book was going to be was the miss-spelling of Bennett on the first page. Due to the grammatical and spelling errors, I don't think the book had a professional editor review it prior to publication. The book is a series of disjointed little stories, each one becoming progressive preposterous. Personalities have dramatically changed and among other continuity errors, Mary Bennett is now the youngest sister. I agree with the other one star reviews submitted - this book is so awful I didn't waste my time finishing it."
1,What a mess!,"This is, without a doubt, the worst sequel I've read. Historically innacurate in plot, character's choices and language, I just finished it to laugh at it, actually. As has already been noted here, only purchase this if you are amassing a collection -it's not worth it."
1,Major interference with my other programs,The rest of my programs would not function after I installed Kaspersky.I had to unistall it to get them to work again.
3,Why my computer won't work.,"Kaspersky Anti=Virus 6.0 was installed several months ago but it is still not up and running completely. This is mostly because I haven't taken the time to learn all of its aspects; all I want to do is get up and running. It was so strict when I first loaded it I couldn't get anywhere on the internet, my computer seemed to be running continuously in the background, and slowing down what programs that were running. Finally I shut it down, and I still haven't set it up correctly.I think this program has some real benefits, and will use less computer time once I get it set up the way I want it, but for now it is a real pain. (as are all of the anit-virus programs that I have tried like Norton and McAfee. The latter two are even worse!"
5,Excellent Product for Virus Protection,"I am very pleased with this product. It was easy to install, Windows XP. Once installed it scanned my computer and found several virus that had gone undected by my Norton software."
1,Do not buy,When you can download for free a much better system from the web I would not even consider this program. Download AVG for free and you will never have any problems or hang ups.
2,Depressing follow-up to his great debut album..,"""Author Unknown"" is so superior in every way to this medicore album, it's not even funny. This album lacks the hooks and sweet melodies of its predecessor. Nigel Godrich strips away whatever musical virtues Jason may have (had). The ""Flavor of the Month"" Godrich was a wrong fit for Jason. The best songs here would be the lesser songs on ""Author Unknown"". And even at that, those songs were either outtakes from his previous album, or outtakes from the Grays album. As of May 2006, Jason hasn't recorded a follow-up (not counting that Beatles novelty album). He did record an ep a year or two, but that, like this album, was a virtual washout.Save your money and skip it."
4,no snap in the connection,"I give this product only 4 stars because when connecting the cable into my cable box and my audio recever the connection is some what lose, it did not snap into place as did another cable I have from a different company. The cable does the job but I have to make sure that the cable does not come out when moveing the equipment around. For the price it works!"
4,very sturdy,"very nice toslink cable that feels like its going to last for a whilei dont know about the rest of the reviewers but my receivers are leveled and never tugged on or touched so the cable stays in place perfectlythe sound, tho, is not that good for me but ive been thru alot of amplifiers and expensive monster cables so im veeeery picky. plus im only 19 and haven't lost any of my hearing.....im using it for my room, not the living room but for average users, its alright.."
5,Awesome!!!!,"Best buy or Radio shack would want to charge you at least forty bucks for a wire of this quality. Save yourself some cash and go for this! It has a nice rubberized surface, and the length was perfect for my needs!!!"
5,works and cheap,I always believed that all optical wires were created equal. Its just the name that makes it expensive. Great buy and cheap.
4,Excellent product and shipping,"It's an excellent product, but it's not actually Belkin. It's Pure A/V, which is made by Belkin. I have 2 HDMI cables and this optical cable from Pure A/V, however, and they work perfectly at less than half the cost. I have used other brands, and there is no difference."
2,"No way these have ""precision-polished optical terminations""...","Even though on the package Belkin claims ""Ordinary optical cables can compromise your audio performance by using lower-grade, optical-fiber materials, and hot-plate termination of the fiber, rather than polishing."", this cable DOES NOT have ""precision-polished terminations"". One look and you could easily tell the terminations are dull and cloudy. They are not shiny and clear like genuinely polished terminations. If this cable went through any type of polishing it would have to have been some very shoddy work. If it weren't for the rest of the cable's good quality this would've gotten 1 star. Sorry Belkin, but this one does not deserve to be a Belkin product. In the end I decided not to use it and got theNyrius NWOC500 High Performance Digital Audio Optical Toslink Cable (6 Feet)instead. The Nyrius does indeed have ""polished terminations""."
4,Does not fit in all optical plugs,Great thick optical cable with built in cap to protect the connector.The connector itself doesn't fit snug into some optical ports. Perhaps a manufacturing error?
3,...,"Beastie Boys Rock! I am the biggest fan in the world I reckon. But the remixes on this EP suck. Why? Hail Sagen has a good beat once it gets going finially. And who the hell are the Prisoners of Technology? They have talent, but why delete all the lyrics to intergalactic? That's my favorite part of the song. But to their credit the base line to that song is pretty sweet. Oh well, at least the Body Movin' remixes are awsome, but that's a different single boss."
4,Centrism...,I wanted to read about centrism since I didnt know exactly what it was in our American political system and the politicians known for being centrists. Its a good read but kind of cerebral sometimes.
2,a mirror? why?,"This Amityville choice has us in our seat by the power of a mirror that once resided in the house that fear built. The story might have succeeded were it not for better evil possessed item outings in the Amityville series. The camera work and effects strive to make up for the lack of ingenuity with the storyline, and never do we the audience believe this could be anything other than a B-movie attempt at the greatness approached by some Amityville films. Still, some suspense exists and occasional inventive scare tactics intrude now and again, pushing the viewer slowly along the rails of a slightly better than average haunting tale. Not really Amityville caliber, but worth a single rented watch unless you are a die hard Amityville fan who must posess all the films. 2 and a half stars"
4,Great sounds!,"My 10-1/2 month old son absolutely loved this kitchen, from the minute it came out of the box. He loves opening and closing the refrigerator, microwave and oven doors. Mostly, he loves the ""egg"" and will search the living room to find it (even under the bookshelves!). The sounds are great - and are much less annoying than those of the many of other toys in the livingroom. The refrigerator door did fall off once, but was easily fixed. And while the set IS pretty small (it's the same height as him when he's sitting), it's nice to have a kitchen set that we don't have to move out a couch for!"
4,saves your kitchen cabinetes,We decided to get this toy for our 11 months old son after we saw that he was spending hours with the same toy at a day care. He loved closing and opening the doors and placing/removing objects in the microwave and fridge. Before we got him the same toy at home he would open all kitchen cabinets and pull the stuff out. Now since he has his own kitchen he stays away from the real cabinets.
3,Not for Everyone,"I loved the Historical information presented, best for Individuals of American Indian Ancestry, not for everyone."
2,High hopes but was let down,"I read this book last year but never got around to reviewing it at the time. We all know the story, but this book seemed to lack imagination and was mostly boring. Despite some issues with his other book, Moon of Bitter Cold, I thought it had more spark and imagination, and overall, I remember it fondly. But this book left me feeling like the author was just going through the motions. I see that most other readers strongly disagree with me. For a good Custer/LBH novel, I recommendBroken Eagle. I read it a long time ago and need to read it again to see if it holds up, but I have very good memories of it."
4,pretty good,Got the CD for one song (what a 90's thing of me to do) but was pleasantly surprised at the overall CD. Its super chill and nice to listen while writing or driving.
5,more choices,"I did not know of this converter until a search for camp fuel. Liquid fuel was not available during the last two power outages, this allows the use of propane. It attaches easily and does not prevent future use of liquid fuel. Delivers a perfect flame for emergency use. Don't hesitate to try it."
5,"Simple, Effective Conversion","I installed the converter in my old Coleman stove. The latch is a little awkward to hook to the stove so that the converter is tight. The stove lights easily and quickly with the converter installed. And, the heat intersity regulates easily. Cooked with it in hunting camp. Stove works better with propane than with white gas. I am very satisfied."
2,Could have been better,"This story could have been great or even a little better if the author had put a bit more personality behind the characters. Also she gives you a brief history of the two womens past in the beginning of the book. Then when the flashback happens it is sudden and takes over half the book. I would have liked some more meat to the two of them getting together and what they did to get where they are now. To me the characters seemed one demensional. The only one I really liked was Cyndi, Danis friend."
5,Loved it,"I should start out by saying that I'm generally a fan of Mormon cinema. Given the low budgets, most of the films are remarkably good. I'm curious to see what happens as this particular genre matures over time. Within the genre, Charly's production qualities are well below par. I often felt like I was watching a 1980's made for tv movie. Most of the acting, with a couple of notable exceptions, is also below par. That said, I somehow managed to give this movie 5 stars. It is one of the most powerful love stories I have ever seen because it not only tells of eternal love, but it believes in it. Forgive its failings and listen to the message. You'll love it."
4,"A very well thought-out book on symbolism in the media, basically","I bought this book along with ""If it's Purple, Someone's Gonna Die."" This book (""Visual Story"") is the more scholarly and useful of the two, while ""Purple"" is an easier read.If you are a critic or student of film-making, this book definitely is a must-have. It's got great info on ""why."" So many books are centered around ""how.""""Why"" is more important than ""how.""Descriptive, though pedestrian illustrations. Clean, honest writing. Easy to understand. Slightly dry. It would be nice to have more real-world examples, but that get's very difficult to get all of those movie and TV show clearances, so I understand why they're not there, but it would have definitely made the book much more interesting."
1,Same taste no Flavor,Ok most of these songs are classics in their own right and it seems like so many of the artists here just played the song as it was on the original recording. I enjoy punk covers and was hoping for something a little more edgy to the sound. Only a couple of songs on this cd are following that formula. I might as well listen to my cure album because the cover really just tried to sound like Robert.
3,Could have been better,I'm a huge fan of Techno and metal and when these 2 forces collide I usually like the outcome. But....Videodrone..I really don't like it that much. There is something about Videodrone I really don't like. The singers voice isn't that great and insturmentally Videodrone is lacking.Hopefully their next cd will be better..
5,More Thrills From the Book of Korn,"Videodrone are simply amazing. This CD puts together the electronics and vocals of Orgy, the fright of Korn, and the slight funk of Incubus. This CD demonstrates it all. Ty Jonathan Down and Faceplant, the singles are the best songs here, but Alone With 20 Bucks is also good. The only part I don't like is that they don't pour on their funk metal influences like they did when they were Cradle of Thorns. A few other good songs on it are Jesus (Lord of the Apes), Human Pinata, Closer to Coma, and Ant in the Dope. If you like this I'd recommend these bands; Orgy, Professional Murder Music, Taproot, and Hoobustank."
5,Great record,...but the vocalist from Cradle of Thorns / Videodrone is not in this Karmahitlist band like this other guy says. FYI.
2,Disappointing...,"I think that while this book was better than the fist book in the series, it wasn't that great. It was a lot of stereotypes. The characters just did what they always do. There are a lot of better books by these authors. I'm just sorry this good idea about the Day of Honor series turned out to be so bad!"
1,Don't read this book!!,This book was poorly written drivel. I didn't even finish this it disgusted me so. I want to make sure no one else has to go through the torture of reading that. And is it just me or is the science vessel named after a Spice Girl (Victoria Adams)? I will never buy another novell written by her/them ever again. It hadn't even talked about the day of honor and I was about halfway through.
1,Don't bother,"This futon literally fell apart the first time I sat on it (all 130lbs of me). We had to by extra wood to install to make it last longer, but it literally collapsed withing a few weeks of owning it. Do not waste your money."
3,Scar Scares,"Warning people that scarring may be a consequence of a natural cancer treatment may seem important, but these risks need to be weighed against similar risks associated with surgery, not to mention the danger posed by cancer.In my book, Cancer Salves: A Botanical Approach to Treatment, I offer a number of suggestions for reducing the potential for scarring, simple measures such as adding turmeric to a formula to more sophisticated strategies that entail detoxifying the blood before commencing an escharotic treatment."
3,Good buy,Nice product at a nice price. There are not that many pieces but if your son or daughter enjoys marble games this will get them started. If you are interested into more complex constructions get the bigger set.
3,OKAY.......EXPECTED MORE.,"Tevin Campbell use to be one of my favorite male singers but what happened to his career. This album is just okay but I think the real problem was the promotion behind it. Even though the first single which was titled ""Another Way"", got a lot's airplay, it wasn't enough to put him back into the runnings with other male R&B stars. His first two albums got him famous but this album and his third didn't make a dent on the charts. Overall, due to the scandals and tabloids, this talented young man's career is over."
4,Tevin & his music are growing up before our very eyes!!!,"Act like you know cause if you didn't I'm here to tell you. This album Tevin showcases a broad range and travels a path where many R&B singers would not dare to tread. Radio, keep it up by not giving Tevin any love, 10 to 15 years will pass and the man and the voice will still be around. I appreciate the fact that Tevin is using his gift to bless us all who would stop to listen instead of trying to formulate the regular R&B booty and freak songs that cloud the airwaves daily. This is his fourth album and we've watched him grow before our eyes and just think he's the bomb now..wait till life bites him in the tail a little and he REALLY has some things to sing about. His best is yet to come!!!!!"
3,Manufacturing issues,"The first 2 that I ordered, the attachment straps on both were incorrectly sewn and the straps just came away before installation. The next two I ordered work well and had no issues. Worked great. Again, no problems with return of the first two."
3,Good Book. Great if not so many errors.,Overall a good book but the exercises and CD solutions are full of errors. For example: A question will state a 7% interest rate and a 4 year repayment but the solution CD will be solved at 8% for six years. Excel formulas used incorrectly (using blank spaces rather than zeros in NPV/IRR data ranges). Fudged numbers in the chapter on financial statements--multiple errors were used to offset each other to give the right answer. Should have found a better grad student proof-reader.
5,Excellent Finance Textbook,This is the best book I have adopted in this area of finance. There have been several books attempting to incorporate or integrate Excel in Corporate Finance and Investments. This book is the first one that comprehensively covers most finance subjects at the introductory level fully utilizing Excel. I find that there is a smooth linkage between finance and Excel in this book.
5,Incredible Read,"I've known Cyndia for several years now and was blessed to be able to read ""Amanda's Rib"" when it was still in its infancy. This is an incredible read. Cyndia grabs your attention in the first paragraph and never lets go. This is a highly recommended read."
3,this album was OK,"I got it for ""What Would You Do"" this album was alright, but not that great.. I don't like the producer, Wyclef Jean. And the only person who has a good voice in City High is Claudette Ortiz.. But the CD is still OK... My favorite tracks are Best Friend, Sista, Caramel.. I recommend this album to you if you're a fan of City High, which I'm not really.."
1,Very disappointing.,"I was extremely disappointed as I was expecting useful information above and beyond the respective web page's information. This short, brochure-like book, contains nothing that a person of minimal intelligence doesn't already know. While I love the concept, this book, in my opinion, contributes nothing to the desired results - letters to our children."
2,Not the best beads,"I bought these beads for my 2 year old because he needed them for fine motor skills. Although there are a lot of choices here at amazon, I went to the store and these were the only ones they had, so I got them. Well, he was excited at first and wanted to play, and he likes the bright colors, but because they are made of wood, the string doesn't go through that easily. It catches all the time on little pieces of wood on the inside and he gets very frustrated. I would recommend the soft beads offered on Amazon over any wooden set!! I'm going to order them too."
4,"An up-to-date text, useful for the competent beginner","I bought the book after (and despite) the review of the Reader From Austin, TX; and I was not disappointed by this book. Martin covers all aspects of U/W photography in a concise way, giving just enough examples and explanations. It provides a lot of feedback on using common contemporary housed systems, which not many other presently available books do.I agree that it offers little in terms of complete basics; and it will not stretch the professionals. But hey, I'd like to think that I fit in the middle. And I do not want to waste another 20 rolls of expensive slide film before finding out where I went wrong. Martin's book has warned me in advance about some of the pitfalls.The only possible criticism is that the book could have provided more than just a couple of examples for each described situation. However, this would make the book big and pricey. And as it is, you can even take this reasonably slim volume with you on the liveaboard."
1,Very disappointed!,"I was very disappointed in this book. It was so old that the pages were all yellowed at the edges. I bought used, so I guess that part is acceptable, but it was copyrighted 1989 not 1992 like the listing said.The information in it makes no mention of anything from the viewpoint of anything electronic. I am afraid that the information is probably so outdated that it will be of little use to me. Should have dug deeper instead of being sucked in by the title; my fault. Just be warned...get something more recently published so you don't waste your money or time. I learned my lesson. Won't happen again!"
3,"Good subject, lousy implementation, worse than the 1st.","I have to ask some of the people who RAVED about this movie if they actually were awake during the whole thing...The computer generated graphics can not compare to real whales, sorry. I'm a big fan of computer generated images, but not this time.The story is stretched to levels of disbelief that I didn't believe imaginable.It's not horrible, but it's not as good as the first movie.Kids will love it more than adults, that's for sure.The subject matter is great. I love a good eco/bio movie any day but it could have been done better.The little bit of budding romance was actually done reasonably well.Net: I own it, only cuz the wife bought it. I wouldn't have. I've seen it twice, but other than that, it's tough to get through it without laughing. I know, I'm probably much too critical on this one, but hey, sometimes ya just gotta say ""YO.""You might want to rent it before you think about buying it."
4,Cover Draw,"I have to admit it was the spooky cover that made me pick this up, having neither heard nor read anything about it. It's true that sometimes Darnton's passages of expositon are less than artful, but I found it a fun, chilling thriller."
2,"Goofy, but entertaining","Darnton's style of writing is clear and easy to read. For this reason, it was easy for me to keep plowing through the book. It managed to hold my interest, but I'm not sure why. As the story progressed, it become increasingly implausible and ridiculous. When I finished the book, I resolved that I must find more productive ways to spend my time"
3,Somewhat different; somewhat the same.,"This was a good try at somthing different, however you could see elements of ""Jurassic Park"" and most ""Lost World"" type stories. And the love affair of Matt and Susan was predictable. A lot of research went into the story and most of it came out in the text. I commend Mr. Darnton on his attempt, but it was really nothing new"
2,"Decent research, silly plot.","While this book isn't awful, it is certainly not a work which I would strongly recommend. The problem isn't the subject matter; the topic is interesting, the author seems to have done his research and there are some tense scenes. However, the basis on which the book is based is ludicrous. The addition of the usual CIA/government conspiracy theories was old ten years ago, and some of the characters were just downright useless. Finally, large portions of the plot didn't seem to have any place/make any sense in the overall story. Overall I'd say I found the book more interesting for the scientific research than for the story itself"
2,Neanderthal is pretty darn far-fetched.,"This book has a beggining you are going to love.Imagine discovering a living neanderthal village!That would be great, but the village that Darntonhas painted for us is so hard to believe in,that Jurrasic Park seems like news of the day.Then the plot twists! I believe the author couldhave thrilled us all with a plausible story whereNeanderthal people have somehow existed. Thetelepathic powers and other absurdities are justover the top."
4,good entertainment,I enjoyed this very much. Enough detail for a good storey but not so many that it bogged it down.
2,Neanderthal Clunker,"Neanderthal was a disappointment. Books of this type often enthrall me, but this one didn't. The cartoon-like characters weren't realistic; I don't think that even the worst of academic professionals would behave as unprofessionally as most of the characters in this book did. The book degenerates into New-Age pseudoscience, with lots of loose ends. The subject matter is tantalizing and needs a more thorough, even reverent look at the roots of humanity."
1,X-Rated Jurasic Park?,"Good concept, simple plot, too much sex! The combination of the three did not work for me. If the movie screenplay follows the book, it will be R-rated. I found the undressing and groping un-nceseeary to the plot and quite silly"
1,An excrescence,"I would recommend the option of zero stars to allow the reviewer to more honestly rate this book. The concept was weak at best, not to mention old-hat for any one interested in the subject. There are huge flaws in the logic, and the dialogue, and the plot, but I'd have to say that characterization is the area in which the author really shines. And by ""shines"" I mean sucks, of course. The real tragedy is that there are authors who cannot get their *non-execrable* works published, and there are porn movies in need of a script. The world is so unfair. I propose a chat group where victims of this book can meet to tear this travesty apart, and maybe learn to trust again."
3,So-So plot,"This book started off alright but the action quickly dropped off and some of the science sounded fake and out-dated. When they they FINALY found the creatures, they seemed like somthing out of a 60's Bigfoot movie. I found it was hard to read near the end."
3,"""Michael Crichton Goes On A Dig""...","Similar to Crichton's work, a scientific twist to a techno-thriller. Not a lot of gee-whiz high-tech stuff like Clancy, but a good page turner based on a scientific concept. I enjoyed it very much."
3,I can't believe it...,"I really can't. Even though im still bussy reading this book, i think its really great! I've had to admit that the firt 20 page's are not full with action and things but you've GOT to read these page's to understand the other pages. I think its mean to give this book 1 star because i think that if you rate it that low, you don't understand the whole story. I really love it. The passion of the characters, the fear, the romance everything it's so? How do i say it HUMAN. I really love the idea that someone at the States makes a movie about this book. Bravo John Darton. Keep on going!"
3,Not all bad,"Neanderthal wasn't a bad book. If Kellicut hadn't changed so much it would have been a lot better. The ending was also depressing, too easy. The idea itself was really good."
2,not as good as the ads,"I had several problems with the story, the least of which was credibility. There is no scientific basis for any conclusions drawn by the author. Jurassic Park was based on faulty thinking as well, but at least it was mildly beleivable. Neanderthal left me feeling like I got taken by the advertising campaign"
2,Darnton: The next Crichton?,"Darnton writes an entertaining story that seems perfect for adirect transition to movies. While it reads fast when it getsrolling, Crichton fans won't help but notice the similaritiesbetween the two writers. They use similar plot devices andcharacters to tell their supposedly ""scientifically-based""stories. Personally, I try to avoid expressing disbelief and try to play along but some of Darnton's reasoning left me scratching my head. Still, it's an entertaining book that you should at least look into"
5,A beautifully illustrated cleverly crafted children's story.,"This book was pivotal in my formative years. To this day, I vividly remember the intricate sequence of events leading up to the firing of the canon. If the story line isn't enough, the meticulously crafted, colorful, woodcuts brighten and add depth to the whole experience."
5,Great oldtime favorite with rhymes and rhythm.,"This story was one of my (34yr old) son's favorites when we took out library books years ago. I was thrilled to find this lovely copy for his son, my young grandson."
2,STAY AWAY...You deserve better.,"Even if you're a beginner, stay away from this brand.I bought an Austin Bazaar brand guitar from Amazon a few years back. Within a month of purchase, the neck cracked (I did not drop or mishandle it) and the company would not allow a return or refund. I was stuck with it.The action is too high, making it harder to play fast notes at the higher frets like many rock guitarists want to play. This can be adjusted, but it would cost the same to fix as you would pay to purchase it.Finally, the brass pieces separating the frets are actually sharp and don't feel good as you're moving across the fret board.Pay just a little bit more and get a Fender Squier Bullet or an Epiphone Les Paul Jr. For smaller hands, Fender and a few other respected brands make mini versions of their guitars for about the same price.And happy playing!"
3,Appropriate for value priced shoppers,"The quality and durability is average for sets in this price range.The appearance is clean and simple.The soft metal surface does scratch easily. If you have any hard water issues, the smooth surface may show water spots.If you use any sort of abrasive cleaning, such as a scratch pad, the surface WILL scratch. Hand drying may be necessary.The knife handles are somewhat heavier than average. The set is heavy enough to prevent bending.If you are looking for a set in this price range, and avoid the scratching issues mentioned, you'll likely find they are satisfactory."
3,it's just an empty feeling,"this is the rock and roll girls vs the Aztec mummy..without the cool music..if you like that video,this one going to leave you wanting more..like craving chines,but eating a muffin instead..sure you feel full,but your still craving the chines..look if you never saw the rock and roll girls..and you like over dubbed,classic aztec mummy movies..than get it..you won't be disappointed..great bad acting,mad doctors gone wild,sexy weseling girls,who's hair never gets messed up..and even a mutant guy..who eats raw meat..and a pair of laurel and hearty,cops..and the gang..i love these kind of movies..so i'm there even with this one(kind of)..just plz....give me the music..thxs for the read thu..hope this helps.."
5,Greenwich Village mystery from the inside - great fun.,"What seems to be another mindless killing on the piers off Christopher Street takes you to an Art Opening in SoHo, a Dog Show at The Garden, hidden places in the Village, and introduces a dog that sees and understands more than most people. Walking the streets of NY with Dash and Rachel gives the reader an insider's perspective. I am hooked. Could Benjamin become the Clancy of Canines? I hope so! Waiting for the sequel."
2,Uhhh,I love Susan Conent books and expeted this was simmlilar but it wasn't. It was catchy at the beginning but the rest was just boring.
3,Without Susan only one star,"Most things are wrong in this thriller.It starts with the title, which must have been selected by a robot. No relation to the story.The casting is wrong. As much as I am a Susan Sarandon admirer, she just should not play young mothers any more; she is about 20 years too old for the part. Sorry, Susan, make that 10 years.That said, she does a marvellous job as a woman on a journey into nervous wreckdom.The script makes hash of a story which might have been saveable, it has good elements. The wasp espisode is underutilized, it has potential. As it is done, it is amateurish and weak.The solution to the riddle, w/o wanting to give it away, is surprising enough, but not entirely plausible as far as the ""bad guy"" is concerned. It is not fully in character, which falls back on the casting and the actor.The closing scene is sort of a minor quote from Psycho, but lacks the creepyness of Anthony Perkins in his cell."
2,an is-she-or-is-she-not nuts thriller,"It amazes me that such fine actors participated in such a bust of a film. This is so excruciatingly bad, even painful, to watch that I could barely watch it to the end.Take a beautiful, accomplished if somewhat ditzy older woman, throw in a mid-life marriage crisis, and a mysterious younger beauty. Add fear and possible insanity, titillation, and some haphazard explanations thrown in that don't fit with the plot, and you have a disaster of incoherence, eventually leading to violence and wholly unbelievable pseudo-resolution. But at least the actors were fine. OK, the ending does add a nice twist. So 2 stars instead of one.Alas, this film simply doesn't work. Don't get it, don't even rent it."
2,Australian Teleplay,"I bought this movie based on the Amazon reviews and the star power I like both Susan Sarandon and Sam Neil.The movie is very slow (which doesn't bother me) however its not well written and its not very interesting. The viewer comes into a story that feels like its been in progress for a long time. We're supposed to question, I guess, if Sarandon is unstable or being stalked. Then out of the blue we're given a story hook that is a complete gimick for explanation.I doggedly stayed with the film but the ending wasn't satisfying and the story felt like it was being written along the way.I really like the actors, Emily Blunt (a hoot in the Devil Wears Prada), Neil (you MUST see him in the Tudors season 1) and Sarandon. I don't need bang bang shoot em up to enjoy films. If the writing is there so am I. This film is not worthy of such a talented cast."
5,Roy Orbison: In Dreams,Had been looking for this for my husband. Just typed in Roy Orbison on search engine. Came up on ebay Amazon the suppliers. Ordered it and had it within a week. My husband is one happy chappy! He watches it all the time. I must say...I love it too! Thankyou AMAZON.
2,great on paper but it sucks in reality,I was extremely dissappointed. Followed instructions and SOAKED chips for 2 hours only to have them start on fire and BURN everything on my grill.....But don't take my word for it ...try it yourself!
5,Kids say the darndest things,"I first found this book in a library, and I enjoyed the honest, personal stories shared within so much that I bought a copy for myself. This is a book I want to share with my own family some day. The editors let each family say their thoughts, be they politically correct or not, they are honest. Many, many thought-provoking comments made by the kids especially!"
3,Modern roots,"This album, which sounds a lot like Steel Pulse and Third world, does a great job being both very fluid with its solidrhythms and catchy. I love the lyrics."
4,Cats don't mind it in their bowl,"In fact, either they didn't notice it or they actually like the flavor. When we first added it to the dry food bowl, it was business as usual. We stopped putting it in our little schnauzer's bowl because it gunked up his beard and made it stinky.How else to take care of your cat's teeth? Dental cleanings are getting more and more expensive--and we have three cats. So, we're doing all we can to try to keep tartar at bey. We also use Temptations treats by Wiskas. I think this product is worth it. We'd do almost anything to avoid putting the cats under anesthesia to clean their teeth.I wondered if the powder would cause cat acne, but we've not had any trouble with that."
1,Doesn't work,"Either this stuff doesn't work or my dog has super bionic kibble breath. My guess is the former, not the latter."
2,"Easy, Breezy for Me, Dog Won't Eat It","I'm not one for brushing pet's teeth and my dog is no fan of anyone fussing around or in his mouth. We're PERFECT candidates for using this product and I readily volunteered to test it. The convenience and ease of use definitely got my attention. Simply sprinkling it on his food (kibbles) is easy, breezy for me BUT he won't touch his food. Mixing it in didn't help either. Hiding it with gravy or broth got him to eat it.My dog's rumbling stomach was unnerving. When he asked to go out I didn't stall at all. Cleaning diarrhea and/or vomit takes my breathe away as I dry heave my way through the task. Perio-Support for him = Life-Support for me if those ""rumbling tummy results"" were in the house!Although it didn't work for us, I suggest getting a sample to make sure your pet will consume it without tummy upset or other issues."
3,Intriguing Zombie Flick,GRAPES OF DEATH is not your typical zombie film. It is very different from every other zombie flick. Although some have compared it to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD...it really does not resemble NOTLD beyond it being about zombies.I found GRAPES OF DEATH slow but not unappealing. It reminded me of an art film basically. It is definately an 'auteur' type of production.At times it is confusing but I think Jean Rollin was trying for something more than just standard fare.
4,Good children's book about immigrant life at turn of century,"I found this to be a well-written children's book with a good story-line and fun to read. This story is about a young italian immigrant (second generation) girl growing up in New York City about the turn of the century. She loves to read and has a wonderful summer adventure that enriches her life and the life of her family. Both girls and boys will enjoy this book, although I think girls might enjoy it more."
5,Deserves 6 stars,"If you have to get only one Unix book, this should be it. It won't provide tutorials or a lot of background, but it does provide the most wide-ranging reference for Unix available.The section at the beginning of the shells section which lists standard operators is invaluable for writing scripts.It does have weak spots -- it limits its scope to relatively generic Unix commands, and doesn't deal with the often-proprietary command sets for LVM and networking, among other things -- but otherwise, it's a fine book."
5,"How can you not love ""Love Songs?""","I love this CD. When I was shopping for this CD last year, I couldn't find one that had all the original songs on it, like ""No Valentines"" and ""You Can Make History."" So I was glad to find that this CD that Amazon sells contains all the original music. This is by far Elton John's best CD, imo. Shipping, too, was great! I received the CD in just a matter of days!"
5,Wonderful for lusae like me!,"This book is one of the greatest purchases I have ever made! It provides what is sorely needed in the Latin language - a comprehensive conversational guide. Other foreign languages have no shortage of such books, but for some reason people think that no one needs to speak Latin. Even if you have no interest of speaking with Caeser, using this book will vastly help your comprension and understanding of Latin. Amo Latinam linguam!"
3,Please...,man screwball fell off..anyone who listened to their first album knows this. The lyrics dont even compare and the beats are beyond weak. I still say Y2K is one of the illest albums of all time.
3,Very Nice,"This toy has made my little sister, Corrina, so happy! She's almost completed the Happy Family set and really enjoys playing with them! She says they rock! They're the bees-knees for any child to play with! Even, I, (...) like to join her game once in a while!Courtney,(...)"
4,Great oven!,"I bought this oven to go into the conversion school bus I'm working on. It's the perfect size for cooking - and can serve as a microwave (which i will not have in the bus) as well as an oven! This oven is made by Hamilton Beach. We own one other, smaller Hamilton Beach toaster/toaster oven (it has toast slots in the top) and it works great! We LOVE it! I have yet to actually use my new oven, but I am very excited about it, seeing the great performance we have seen out of the smaller Hamilton Beach oven we have. I bought this while it was on sale - only around $90 - which is why I haven't used it yet. The bus is nowhere near ready to have cooking appliances installed, but I couldn't pass up the great low price, and it offered everything I wanted in an oven for my bus!"
4,Rotisserie,Just got the 3199R Countertop 1.1 Cft Convection Oven with Rotisserie. Tried to Rotissiere a whole chicken. 5lb chicken is too big. The Rotissiere has trouble turning. Will go to Convection Bake. Next time I will buy a smaller chicken.Reccomendation: Beef up the Rotisserie motor and connection.
3,Large but slower cooking than T-Fal Avante,"This oven is quite spacious. However, when I broiled a dish that I make regularly it took 25% longer than the broiler on my old T-Fal Avante elite. I miss the digital controls and toast settings on my T-Fal and lacking on the Hamilton Beach but hopefully this oven will last longer (my T-Fal died after 18 months)."
2,"Sadly, had to send it back","With high hopes we purchased the Hamilton Beach counter top convection oven. We researched several different ovens, and based on the reviews chose this one. We tried it out the first day, and noticed that when taking it out of the box the top of the oven had several small dents in it. We decided that the dents alone weren't a problem, we could live with them, but once we turned it on (following the manufacturers recommendations) the convection setting had an awful rattling noise. It was so loud it actually vibrated items on the counter sitting close to it. We cooked two meals in it and decided that the noise just couldn't be right and wasn't acceptable. We did not want to listen to that every time we cooked something. So we decided to send it back and purchased a Breville through Amazon instead. Hopefully, the next convection oven will be a winner."
2,Worked well for two weeks...,"This worked really nicely for the first two weeks, then the convection fan failed. Hamilton Beach has promised to send a replacement but we haven't seen it yet."
2,"Reviewed well, but not my thing","I'm very hit or miss with doom/goth metal, and this is a miss for me. The first track, Sear Me MCMXCIII, starts off well, but doesn't go anywhere. The rest of the album continues on the same path. I know that people who love doom metal consider TLTS to be a classic, and magazines, like Decibel, hold it in high regard. To be fair, I wouldn't listen to my opinion if you're into doom metal. Find out what other doom metal fans think and judge it that way."
1,Hi,"Thought this cologne was gonna be better, not worth the price for a small bottle, smells very cheap, like something you would pick up at Rite Aid or Cvs, for 10 dollars more I got a small bottle of Dolce&Gabbana which smells amazing, I'd recommend about 20 different scents before Realm.."
3,it works,"this is a good video to use with minimal equipment to purchase. but its for people that are already fit. if you're just starting it, don't do as many reps until you get used to all the exercises. or use light weights."
3,O.K. workout but got annoyed by Claudia,"The workout itself was fine, but I got turned off by the porno-soundtrack music and the way Claudia kept looking suggestively into the camera (winks, come-hither smiles, etc.) This video is definitely aimed more at Claudia's male fans than serious exercisers."
5,Awsome,"Blitz is the best game ever. Madden is a good game if you want something realistic, but in Blitz how can you not love doing wrestling moves in football?!!"
1,Disappointed,Very disappointed with this - partially my fault as I didn't realise it was an essay.Had no idea who the author was.basically vitriolic politics - but a necessary work for anyone research the Atlanta Youth murders.Not wanting to appear racist but I was offended but a variety of comments.Being white and English is obviously not a good thing in Baldwin's eyes.But everyone is entitled to an opinion.
1,A waste of money. Did not help a bit on recent trip,"We tried 2 recommended places. Ronneberg Gard was an unfriendly place up a nondescript hill with no signs or advice and we just gave up and left. And I speak Norwegian. Petrine's Gestgiveri, at Norddal,had one grubbyroom available when we arrived, with 2 low sloppy beds and a bathroom a long walk away.I am sure they had better rooms with advancec reservation, to be fair.In many other towns on our West country tour, there was no listing in the area. This book offers much too little to justify buying it or carrying it to Norway."
1,Worst Marley Album to date!!,The Over dub took away his reggae roots. All Fans of Marley Be Warned This is bad!
2,Not Good,"I don't mind a low budget effort if it can get an important message across.However, there is a real lack of craft here. The acting seems decent enough,but the look of the thing, the lack of finesse in the soundtrack, and the failure tosuccessfully capture seemingly strong performances is surely the fault of an inept director.I don't sympathize with the characters and some of the actors come off as over the top and unbelievable in theirperformances. Some of them seem to be acting in a play while others, like the amazing Keir Dullea,are acting exquisitely for the camera. Unfortunately, most the time, the camera isn't capturing that work.I'm no expert on screenplays, but there seem to be some holes there, too.There are two related story lines going on at once, but only one of them crosses the finish line.There's a good reason you haven't heard of this film before."
4,Comebacks,"another in the Dean Hargrove - Joel Steiger Comeback Series {Perry Mason Movies first (Raymond Burr), then Matlock (Andy Griffith), then Jake & The Fat Man (William Conrad), Diagnosis Murder (Dick Van Dyke) and finally McBride Movies (JUohn Larroquette), all guest starring actors making comebacks (too many to name!)Matlock (1986-1992) {NBC} 140 eps & (1992-1995) ABC 55 ep Andy Griffith comeback as an Atlanta lawyer. Watchable and entertaining, the best thing is the jazz theme is one of the TOP 50 All-Time TV Themes!Amazon webpage says won't send me Season 2 so will have to buy it somewhere else!"
2,MATLOCK Season One,"QUALITY OF DVD IS TERRIBLE! Matlock is an enjoyable series to watch, as far as the content goes. Who doesn't like watching Andy Griffith? However, the reason I give this only 2 stars, is that the quality of the picture is simply terrible! Have you ever bought one of those $1 DVDs at Walmart, and noticed how bad the quality of the picture is during playback? Well, that's exactly what you get with this Matlock DVD set, with the only difference being that you pay 30 times more for it! Images are fuzzy and blurred, except for in extreme close-ups that fill the screen. In many scenes it actually has ""wavy distortion"" of distracting artificats going along the top of the screen.It's really too bad, because DVDs are capable of a much-better picture quality than this. If the quality of picture doesn't matter to you, then you will totally enjoy this set. But if quality of picture does matter to you, then you will be disappointed with this presentation. Rent it instead."
1,The packaging sucks,I don't know where they get these packaging designers from but the designers of this package didn't know what they were doing. I've had two sets delivered and both times the package arrived with the hinge assembly that is inside broken. The discs are damaged. There are better ways to package multiple DVDs.
3,Fair introduction to the Vatican,"DVD, not Blue Ray. Fair introduction to the Vatican but lacks pictures of major places one would expect to learn about. Minimal historical review. Not bad but not what I was looking for."
2,Strictly for the devout Catholic viewer,"I was disappointed in this video. I came to it not as a devout Catholic but as a fan of travel videos. In other words, I watched this video with the same motivation I would have to watch Shackleton's Antarctic exploration, or something from the Globe Trekker series.With that in mind, the target audience for this video is not me. It is the religious Catholic. Therefore, from my perspective, I can't recommend it. I'm not one for all the pomp and circumstance of religion. I don't enjoy worshipping the ""Holy Father"", or watching the construction of the clownish uniform of the Swiss Guard.If you are a devout Catholic you will probably enjoy this video. If you are not, and just came to the video because you wanted a Globe Trekker style tour of the Vatican, you are likely to be disappointed.And that is what these reviews are for - to let you know whether you will enjoy the video or not."
4,Good with a twist ending.,"This book was semi-good and it also had a twist ending. Not one of the best books I've ever read, but it was still pretty good. The book kind of stayed on a subtle level."
5,A Kiss To Die For...,"R.L. Stine is amazing!! This book was very cool. I have read it twice and it hasn't gotten boring. I would recommend reading it at least twice because the first time I read it, I didn't catch everything.Excellent book!!"
5,LOVE THESE BOOKS!,"If you're a fan of vampire romantic fiction, you'll enjoy this one, I know I did. It is extremely funny in places and as typical of Katie Macalister you feel as though the book is in first person. It is an amazing read. You will enjoy!"
1,disappointing characters....,"this is the second book by this author that I've tried (Noble Destiny was the other), and sadly I do not see what all the fuss is about. I noticed that in both books the heroine's behaviour and dialog, in particular, are very immature.Maybe I'm just too old for this writer's style (I'm 36), but like another reviewer indelicately wrote, the heroine in this book is annoying and ditzy to the point of headache inducing. I also find the idea of a ""airhead"" heroine and a dark, brooding, intelligent hero hooking up highly implausible.I was hoping for a fun, funny book-but in a intelligent way. I find many of these ""comic"" romances tend towards vapid, seemingly brain dead heroines-not my thing-I'd rather watch an Anna Nicole Smith show if I want that:)For a funny and sexy vampire series-may I recommend the Sookie Stackhouse series by Charlaine Harris instead.1 star."
3,Tough Read,"I want a smart heroine for once. I enjoyed the comedy, but in some way was insulted by the ignorance of our beloved star.Despite my disappointment, I still enjoy Katie's style and most of her works."
1,Uninteresting or Boring.... you pick!,"I am sorry....but this book was so annoying. Actually, the author should be sorry....really sorry for writing this mess. I really love this author too but I can not ""fake it"". I did not care one iota about Joy, who by the way was not interesting or amusing. Just not worth my vision time to read about. The only character that I did like was Christian, he was interesting and sounds very sexy. As for Roxy I am surprised that Joy didn't ring her next on about 5 different occations. She pushed me over my tolerance level. I couldn't take it any more...I just skimmed to the ending with relief."
4,"at times silly, but still fun to read",I think my biggest disappointment was the hero. I expected more I guess from him. At times I did roll my eyes at the over the topness but it did keep me engaged.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Very light weight, and drags it out a bit. A desperate and dateless chick decides to go on a holiday to the Czech Republic after hearing about some weird vampire legends.Of course she runs into a couple of guys that might be or might not be. Cue George Hamilton, etc. Ok if you like that sort of thing, very tongue in check and not taking itself at all seriously which wasn't too bad."
1,Don't go breaking my eardrums,"Yet another hits collection from Mr. Boring himself, this one features the sickening ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"", which is surely one of his most worn-out numbers ever. Can anyone actually want to hear this stuff again? Besides, they still play this junk on the radio, so why would you want to spend your hard-earned cash on this CD, or any other by Elton John, for that matter. This stuff is the antithesis of cool. Do yourself a favor; buy something else."
1,Over-Priced,I'm a luthier and bought this one for my client 3 years ago (in 2005). It was the first guitar I bought from the amazon.com. It was made in China... so... we know what the quality is. The seller had to ship me another one because the first one had a crack on the neckheel. With half of this price you can buy the same guitar on the ebay.. and of course with the same BAD Quality.
1,Why is it edited?????,"Like most everybody else, the packaging was an issue at first, but frankly the new packaging takes up a lot less space on an already crowded shelf, so no problem. My gripe (and it is a BIG one) is the fact that these episodes were edited from the originals. Don't believe me? Look on the back of the case in the little rectangular box at the bottom and it says so right there. Had I known this, I would never have ordered it, as much as I love this show. What the idiots at CBS Video apparently don't understand is that the whole point of buying complete seasons is that so we can see the complete episodes as they were intended to be seen, not some hacked up versions by some no-talent hack who has nothing to do with the show in the first place. I feel like they should redo this season on dvd and give everybody who bought these hacked up versions a copy for free. Anybody out there in Hollywood listening????????"
3,great show but hate the dvd case,After waiting a long time for this season to come out i was very disappointed when i saw that they changed the case for the box set. I hate it when they do that mid release of a tv series on dvd. sometimes i feel like not even buying it because of this reason. I dont know who they have working on the sets for any tv show they do that to but they need to be fired and replaced with someone who has some common since. but other then that the show is great. just hope the next season doesn't take a few years to come out.
5,Very happy little boy,My 4yr old rec'd this for his 4th birthday. He cannot stop playing with it. We went out and purchased almos all of the other pieces to go with it.
5,The best CD single I've heard until now! AWESOME!,"This is an excellent CD. It's the best Macy Gray single and anyone's single I've heard. ""Why didn't you call me"" is cool, funky, and it is a song you can identify with. The music is incredible and the enhanced video is awesome. I especially like the live version of ""I can't wait to meetchu"" because you can feel Macy Gray's great stage presence and tremendous voice. I think everyone should buy this CD. Don't hesitate! It's GREAT."
2,Good Book but contains errors,"The book has some errors that I would like to point out:Rebirth not ReincarnationReincarnation as a plant is not possible (not sentient)Craving not DesireAlso a Buddha does not arise every 32,000 years; only after a very very long time (usually measured in eons). There has and will be immeasurable Buddhas arising in the world (not 25). I did also note that there was a references to the Buddha and monks going to and eating ""dinners""; this is not possible as eating in the afternoon is forbidden. The book was a nice read overall but needed a more knowledgeable editor."
4,Good stuff if you're intellectual,"Karen Armstrong, an established author, has given us the story of Siddartha Gautama, who eventually became the Buddha, while also delving into Eastern thinking and philosphy and culture. If you're just looking for the story of Buddha's life, this is probably more involved than what you're looking for, but as a scholarly introduction to Buddha AND Buddhism, this is a wonderful book!"
4,Another Armstrong thorough history.,"Armstrong is never easy to read,but always worth the reading . She always gives me what I wanted and a lot of data I didn't need."
2,Highly disappointing,"Although the author has the requisite academic credentials, she is tone-deaf where Buddhism is concerned. This book reads like something written in the early 20th century, when studies of Buddhism were entirely overlayed with Western philosophical preconceptions. A much better life of the Buddha is Sherab Chodzin Kohn's ""The Awakened One: A Life of the Buddha.""Armstrong's main contribution is to situate Buddhism in the context of the yoga movement that was in full swing when the Buddha lived. But she is so unreliable in discussing the essentials of both Buddhism and yoga that only serious practitioners will be able to see through her Western academic filter.The biggest annoyance of this book is the author's insistence on using Pali spellings of Buddhist terms that are generally known in Sanskrit. This just makes the book harder to read. Unfortunate."
3,Pronunciation of non-English words a distraction,"The story was basic and perhaps better presented in some of the other books about the Buddha, but I did enjoy it. However, the reader had no idea how to pronounce the terms, cities, and names of the persons which were not standard English. It was more than a distraction but an embarrassment and belittled the content."
4,Karen Armstrong Does it Again,"Academic writing typical of KA. Informative, extremely well researched and organized and pretty inspirational due largely to the ""subject matter."". I've studied Buddhism with Geshe Sopa (a Tibetan monk)and prefer the Sanskrit terms but she was apparently working more with the Pali scriptures and used those terms - maybe this was the language of the Buddha himself. Her writing might have had a little more sparkle but am very satisfied with this book that I've been planning to read for a long time."
2,Overrated and detached,"Ms. Allyson tries so hard that it's hard not to at least appreciate what she's trying to do. But the lyric is removed, her vibrato is fast and ugly, and there are so many affectations it's hard to hear the music. I don't understand what the hype is about."
3,"Relax, enjoy life","Sometimes, you get off the train or the bus back from work, payday is a day or two away, you've got beer or wine in the house and you just couldn't afford to stay by work and listen to club music. I mean REAL club music. The kind of music that let's you unwind and relax, the kind that makes you think it's Friday night and your date is Saturday, but you just want to mellow out. Go home and listen to Karrin Allyson while you pop that beer top. Sit on your sofa and get comfortable. She will put you in that club or lounge you couldn't get to. You're home, you're comfortable, but you're down where you should have been if you made fortunes (like your boss). Call your Saturday date and give her a beer out of your fridge. With the two of you and Karrin's stylings, you could be in one of the finest clubs in town. God made your Stereo for a reason, enjoy it."
2,Not for true Coltrane fans,"If you really like Coltrane - if you have ever turned to John in a state of anxiety, depression or melancholy, and were soothed as if he understood your tangled soul and gently combed through it - then you will find little of interest in this peculiar tribute album. The singer and producer have made no apparent attempt to recapture either the emotional space or the lyrical innovation of Trane's approach to balladry. It is, if you will, Pat Boone to Trane's Little Richard. That said, if what you're looking for is a pleasant, quiet cd to sit along side your ""Jazz After Midnight""-style compilations, this one will do just fine. Of course, if you want Coltrane with words, and you don't have it already, then you must buy ""John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman"" before (or instead of) this."
4,Glad I started here,"This was the first Karrin Allyson album I heard. I liked this album -- her singing as well as the ensemble work -- enough to seek out more. If I had started with some of her other albums, though, I probably never would have checked this one out, and that would have been unfortunate. She sounds less forced, less self-conscious, on this album than on, say, Footprints or In Blue. She wears these songs more gracefully than on the other albums. The musicianship here is also more organic than on, particularly, Footprints, which has got to be (I hope) a low point in her catalog. Lewis Nash is one of my favorite contemporary drummers, and he turns in a typically agile yet supportive performance. The sax blowing is the hottest you'll find on any of Allyson's albums. I don't mean to damn Allyson with faint praise, but I'm glad this was the first of her albums I heard, because this is a good one."
3,Early Argento,Early film (1971)written and directed by Dario Argento that is characteristically stylish and gory. A reporter is in pursuit of a mad slasher and is aided by a blind ex-reporter.
3,Surprisingly good,"I had read somewhere that Dario himself didn't think highly of this film and Maltin rates it a BOMB. I was sceptical when I rented this one but in the end I was relieved that I did. It's actually quite good and it has a cohesive plot that keeps you guessing 'till the very end. There's no gore here to speak of but Argento keeps things lively from start to finish and the actors here are amazingly good (compared to many other Argento films). Check it out, it certainly doesn't deserve a BOMB rating, and also, it seems that Dario is never entirely satisfied with his old films, apperently he can't even watch them on t.v."
4,A Surprising Thriller,"I had many difficulties to see this movie from Dario Argento because it was not easy to find it in my country, but when I finally saw it, it really surprised me. Like THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE this second film from the Italian Master of Horror is very impressive. Again Dario used a calculating and very complicated plot, even more than in THE BIRD... This time with more colors and a fabulous score from Ennio Morricone. A great thriller even if Dario thinks it is his most disappointing film."
5,Great wings!,I wore this for dressing up at the elementary school where I work and the kids LOVED it!! They are very durable and big enough for an adult.
5,cold steel choice,"You, yeah you pansies & eunuchs inc., if for once in your life would like to feel the burning coldness of existence, do not miss this unique work of dynamic expressionism.It's gonna blow your brains out, sweethearts."
5,"Great Mott The Hoople CD, But Even Better Was To Come","ALL THE YOUNG DUDES, produced by glam-rocker David Bowie, was the band's first success after three years of great albums which nobody bought. Bowie had offered Mott two songs, the first of which they turned down, but the second of which (the title track) they accepted, because they felt it fit their sound and style, and the result was a song that became an anthem for gay people everywhere. Ironically, however, the band members themselves were all straight, so they had some trouble getting used to this. There are other great songs here, too, including a remake of the Velvet Underground's ""Sweet Jane"" which is better than the original, and guitarist Mick Ralphs's ""Ready For Love"", which he'd remake with Bad Company in 1974. This album is absolutely essential, but an even better one would come in 1973 when Mott ditched Bowie, produced themselves, and came up with the elegaic/cautionary MOTT."
2,Not a Great Advance,"This is a very basic overview of easy descriptive statistics, combined with some Tufte-esque notes on graph display, but for the more sophisticated reader on metrics/data/stats, this is not a real keeper. About 20% of it was new or thought-provoking, so if you're already well-read on this topic, don't get this one."
2,Somewhat helpful,"Few applies the Tufte principles, but with less brilliance. Many of his examples are useful - but the book lacks examples of graphical sophistication. The book may help those looking to simplify the business-class Excel experience - but anyone involved with serious scientific data graphics need to look elsewhere. Consider William Cleveland."
2,Not a puzzle!,This is NOT a puzzle. You don't GLUE a puzzle!!! This is a model and should be labeled appropriately. The flimsy pieces break as you try to get them out of the stamped wood block. I guess that's why they tell you to use sandpaper. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk.
3,A hard one to peg...,"I'll make this short. Bought it, listened to it, didn't really ""get it"". It all sounds VERY lush, deeply philosophical, artsy....but I don't hear anything terribly incredible happening here. Make no mistake, the musicianship here is tight & well-executed, but the Jeff Buckley-isms are just downright TOO much. There's even a hint of Bono happening here in places. Just seems to be a little too derivative for my tastes, but I can certainly see how there's an audience for this kind of thing. I for one am not in that audience. Strong cuts: ""I'm a Monster"", ""Sometimes"", ""Miseryhead"" & ""Medication""."
1,I wish I was Jeff Buckley,"It seems like this guy wishes he was Jeff Buckley so bad, that he even dresses his hair like Jeff. His vocals are hours of Buckley impersonation in the mirror. Lack of originality is so common now, I think I'll pick someone to imitate, then I'll make it big, right??? Then I could be best buddies with my daddy corporation that really really really cares about me!"
1,YAWN.. Thank god the '90s are over,"After listening to my sister's copy of this CD, The part of me that was still awake decided to write this review.Boring. That states it perfectly."
3,mediocre/boring,"other than the excellent song, ""dizzy"", the entire album is either mediocre/boring or slightly better than mediocre (""fallen angels""). if you want entire albums of excellent songs, check out vast (""v.a.s.t."", ""music for people""), remy zero (""villa elaine""), or travis (""the man who"", ""the invisible band"") instead"
5,Awesome,"My brother recently informed me that the album ""Distorted Lullabyes"" by Ours had recieved mediocre reviews by various critics. However I beg to differ. All the songs are smart, melodic, and full of empowerment. The lead singer's voice is strong and clear as well as the instrumentals. Whether you like harder songs like Fallen Souls or softer pieces such as Medication and I'm a Monster, Ours has succesfully produced an album that is truly a work of art and talent. I recommend it to many."
3,The novelty still hasn't worn off...,"First of all, the favorable comparisons to Jeff Buckley are inaccurate. He has the range and that emotive power, but none of the subtelty and that warm jazzy blues quality.Needs to work on songwriting. I'm mainly interested in when he's screaming or doing something interesting with his voice. That seems to be his songwriter's vice. Also, covering more genres wouldn't hurt.That being said, his voice to me is a porchlight to a moth."
5,Awe-inspiring,"As I grow older I find that music doesn't give me the goosebumps that it once did. This music brings back the goosebumps. I swear there are times I'm drawn to tears for the shear beauty of these songs. This band can make you rock out as well as swoon. This singer's voice charges into your soul and wrenches it out. It's very powerful. I hate to compare bands, but the singer's range rivals that of Freddie Mercury. I purchased Ours ""Precious"" first, and when I couldn't get enough of that, I bought this CD. This music is an experience."
2,Salad Bowl Defective - Poor Quality,"I just received the Ironwood Gourmet Extra Large Acacia Wood Salad bowl. The shape and size of the bowl were perfect, however I was surprised at the light weight feel of the bowl when I picked it up - and I was equally disappointed to see a large wide crack down the side of the bowl - rendering it useless. I also ordered the Ironwood Salad UtensilsIronwood Gourmet Acacia Wood Large Salad Utensilsand Ironwood Handled TrayIronwood Gourmet Acacia Wood Norwegian Saddle Tray. The Salad Utensils and Tray are also being returned, due to overall quality issues."
2,Poor quality,This product is real cheap looking.Probably only good for one use.Whatever you do-never ask for a gift wrap- they just put it into a sack
1,Don't waste your money!,"I was so disappointed when the backpack arrived. The poor quality is not evident in the picture. The napkins are cheaply made, the plastic glasses are ugly and the breadboard is like scrap wood. I believe this was the first item I've ever returned to Amazon and I'm a frequent shopper."
4,Low budget but excellent psychological thriller,"Paul Fox wrote and directed this subtle and engaging psychological thriller. Gripping, scary but not your classic horror/slasher."
3,MIND GAMES,"While THE DARK HOURS certainly has its terrifying momments, it lets us down when by the end we are not really sure how much of what has transpired is real or imaginary. It is also a trifle sadistic in its tone, which makes it all the more disturbing and uncomfortable. Kate Greenhouse does a commendable job in the leading role, with good support from Gordon Currie, Aidan Divine, and Iris Graham. I don't mind ""twists"" in movies; in fact, I Love them...but when they come out of nowhere and make little sense or require immense examination, they aren't as satisfying."
5,Still a masterpiece.,"Mike Oldfield's first solo album, leading to a string of distinctive works spanning a decade before he drifted towards commercial mediocrity, remains a masterpiece.As progressive as instrumental progressive rock gets.We've all heard the opening piano-and-bells sequence in The Exorcist, but surprisingly few have listened to the equally-remarkable remaining 20 minutes of Part 1, much less Part 2.Oldfield specializes in complex, overlapping, syncopated melodies and polyrhythms, foreshadowing the nouveau-classical works of Vangelis, Jean Michel Jarre, Steve Reich and many others."
3,the format description is not true,"of course it's a badly dubbed, mexican vampire/wrestling movie...I knew that going in. If you know anything about this movie, you know it's good for some laughs because it's so ridiculous and also it does have some nice scary, atmospheric scenes that lovers of cheesy horror will love. But my main gripe is with Amazon's format description--there's no dolby sound, there's no way this was restored...it looks like a cheap DVD-R copied from an old tape, there is no color and there are absolutely no extras.It's not a special edition and not a director's cut. It's not from Cinevue and not from 2005.When I told this to customer service their response was that if I wasn't satisfied to send it back. They don't understand the concept of correcting the description. We definitely had a failure to communicate."
5,Must See 4Suspense thriller Nuts!,"I ignored this movie for a very long while until I finally made a mistake and clicked on it.this was definitely a hidden gem in terms of a great horror and suspense. The only cast I was familiar with was Dennis Hopper and I never had that much like in his acting as a sane character, but he really took this role with greatness. I was happy about this movie as a whole (despite the crazy finish). Highly recommend for thriller nuts!"
2,Awful in a good way,The acting is so bad in this movie you have to see it. A ripoff of about 300 other movies that are exactly like this.It needs to be seen just for the terrible Dennis Hopper acscent. It fades in and out through the entire movie.
2,As boring as reality tv,"A brilliant premise. Recreate reality tv in a movie. Yay!A bunch of people are kidnapped, locked up in a house, and left to their own devices. The one who is still alive at the end wins the prize money. Yes, it's like Saw 2, but without the sadistic violence. It plays out like most reality shows. The participants party, get drunk, throw up, argue, and fight. It's about as boring as reality tv too, but at least here the participants die and don't just get voted out.Dennis Hopper feels misplaced as an irish priest, but he does add some weight and depth to the film. Without him, this would not be worth watching."
5,Durable and beautiful!!,"I bought this necklace around 2 years ago, maybe more. I wear it every single day and it is not even close to breaking. I absolutely love it! The beads are all the same size, and the color is amazing! This picture does not do the beads justice, they are much, much prettier then that. The lock still holds the same way it did years ago and it had a chain at one end so it's size is adjustable. I take it off before every shower so I'm not sure how the sterling silver would hold in water, but I highly doubt it'd be a problem. Overall one of the best necklaces I have ever purchased. The shipping was fast and the packaging was great. It came in a small blue bag which I still have and use to keep other jewelry. I would definitely buy this again, either for myself or as a gift."
5,Good Intro to Bible,A very entertaining way to learn about the Bible. Good as an introduction. It also helps people who are familiar with the Bible to look at biblical stories from a different perspective.
4,Great book ! Very interesting and revealing...,"Christian fanatics will tear this book apart, but open-minded, interested people will appreciate this book. You'll never get too old to learn new things. This is the kind of book you either love or hate...like always when religious themes are concerned..."
3,Don't Know Much About the Bible Needs a New Title,"This book should be called, Don't Know Much About the Bible by a Christian for Other Christians. The author assumes his readers are Christian and want a Christian interpretation of the Bible."
1,Audiobook Review,"Because there were no footnotes to refer to (being an abridged audio version), I am not sure how documented the author's research is in the print version, but I am fairly certain he relied heavily on the pronouncements of the so-called ""Jesus Seminar"". This gathering of clearly ""progressive"" (read: liberal) biblical scholars has little cachet with traditional Christian thinkers. They are charged with the undermining and distortion of time-honored Christian thought and beliefs.The author makes frequent use of innuendo, half-truths, and as mentioned in other reviews, selective and incomplete scholarship. This work cannot be considered a serious attempt to further understanding of biblical history. It is an obvious and blatant effort to deceive and distort."
1,Natural man trying to describe the spiritual.,"1 Corinthians 2:14-16 ""But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritualy discerned. But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ."" (King James)"
2,Picks out various bible events backed by weak arguments.,"Davis lets his emotions get control of his writing and lacks any substantial facts to back up his arguments. He is quite on sided and doesn't objectively supply all facts relevant to an issue. Don't know much about history or the bible, do we Mr. Davis?"
4,Very Interesting,"I found this book to be an interesting study of the Bible. Although I did not agree with everything the author had to say, I was astounded by all the facts I had never thought about before. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a book about the Bible to challenge your thoughts and teach you something."
1,This book missed the boat,"While I enjoyed Davis' history books, his treatment of the Bible misses the boat (to put it in Noah's terms). While he states some of his finding are controversial, that's not a license to print pure poppycock (such as comparing Genesis to Greek mythology.)It's as if Davis is more interested in looking for controversy instead of simply telling a wonderful story. He does cover the main premises of the Bible very clearly and if he had just stuck to that it'd be an A+.I was going to send this back but want to keep it as an example of how not to study the bible. If the bible is real stuff written by real people (who are at times, real messed up) then I'd have to say Mr. Davis ""don't know much about the bible."" Instead, I'd suggest ""The Message"" by Peterson (available from Amazon.)"
2,Not so funny,"You have to be a fan of Shirley and Laverne to appreciate this not so funny video. Too much performing (dancing, singing, etc.) and not enough well-written humor as in the prior seasons. I actually found a few of the segments boring. Perhaps Cindy William's disputes and dissatisfaction with her acting parts affected the performance of this particular video. Would probably not be interested in purchasing any further produced seasons."
1,bogus baptism belief,"Our local used bookstore had copies of several of Jong's books. After reading them, I can see why. The sellers obviously found out that Jong is teaching a confusing, misleading message, and no longer wanted to have any part of him or his teachings.Jong's premise is that it is essential to one's salvation and freedom from sin(s) that one believe that it was in His baptism by John that Jesus took (""washed"") away and took on Himself the world's sins before finally carrying them to the cross. This ""water and Spirit"" baptism doctrine is a confused misreading of the New Testament. Neither the New Testament nor any of the Church Fathers taught this.In the guise of freeing his readers and followers from a ""works righteousness"" gospel, he instead burdens them with a quirky correct-belief-according-to-Paul-C.-Jong gospel.What other confused Christianities can we expect to come from the East?"
1,Do not believe the lies,"Stale alblum all the way around. Dara has never been the best d&b dj, but he's always been solid. This cd has no feeling to it. Dara, you need to have more creative track selection! There are much better jungle cd's out there! Don't waste your money on this. If you need some ideas, ask me."
2,The Last Drop falls into the gutter.,"At first I was excited about this movie, hoping that it would blow me away like Saints and Soldiers, yet I found myself let down. The opening backdrop on Market Garden and use of real footage was excellent. However despite the intense beginning the movie fizzled out. A confusing story line was the biggest let down, it kept jumping back and forth without proper explanation or time for the viewer to understand what was happening. I was annoyed that the SS Major in charge wore the uniform of an SS Major General, with poor collar insignias. The end was weak, but not horrible. However I would have written the script very differently and found some technical, costume and historical advisors who knew what they were doing. Overall I'm not really happy with the movie and will be passing on it."
1,Disorganized Plot,"This movie is supposed to take place during Operation Market Garden in September 1944, when the Allies tried to get across the Rhine in a serious of three major air assaults. The lack of background to set up the story and cohesive plot make this story very hard to follow. The characters are not introduced in the traditional sense, so you struggle to follow along.Billy Zane's role was a real mystery. He was a British glider pilot without an accent. Was he a Canadian? The Americans, led by Michael Madsen, are played as inept and follows the European template for how to portray Americans.This movie tried to be a cross between Kelly's Heroes and Bridge Too Far. It failed."
1,"Very poorly done, no plot, lousy uniforms, historically garbage.","Looking at the box art and reading the desription, I was expecting something like maybe an updated version of Kelly's Heroes. This is a long way from Kelly's Heroes. This is a great example of some pinhead producer with a decent budget making a pathetic movie. The uniforms of the characters involved are horribly innacurate and in several instances look like they were made out of construction paper - I've seen better in college drama club plays. The plot, if you can call it that, is bloody awful and completely unbelievable. The only thing I kept wondering through this whole movie was ""how did they get the guy from 'Titanic' to agree to be in this train wreck?"" Avoid this one like a bad rash, this could well be in contention for the ""worst war movie of all time"" award."
4,A must for permanent retainers!!,"These are amazing for permanent retainers like I have on both the top and bottom front teeth in my mouth. They are a pain sometimes, but they are necessary in order to make sure your teeth stay clean!"
2,what I wish I had known before buying this book,"First off, this book is meant to be a companion to a course. I bought the book thinking it was something I could read and study at home. That is not what it is meant for. There are many references to class handout materials and audio tapes that I don't have. As far as I can see, the handouts aren't sold seperately on the website (they are bundled with the book) and I can't seem to find where there are classes in my area.I took great offense to chapter 2 of this book where the author outlines her view of the history of pain in childbirth. She basically blames Christianity and the Catholic church. I just didn't need to pay money to be insulted.There are many exercises that I can practice at home (so its not a total waste), but I have no idea if I am doing them correctly as the book is not meant to stand alone.I have yet to give birth, so I can't comment on the course's effectiveness."
1,hypnobirthing a celebration of life,"it wasn't well written and didn't prepare me,i also got The Hypnobirthing Bundle for Happy Hypnomoms and Blissful Hypnobabies which totally transformed my anxiety and prepared me for all the physical and emotional stages of pregnancy and birth. check it out .it was amazing . bennids"
4,"Overall Great CD! If You Liked Eyewitness, You'll Love this!","Although there are a few songs that dont I dont love, songs like ""Beat by Beat"" and ""Gravity"" are great. Other fans may be familiar with ""Behind the Wheel,"" which was available on their website a long time ago. If you're a Shades Apart fan, you won't be disappointed."
2,Don't buy it.! Be careful.,"This is NOT a book for beginning figure drawing. I made the mistake of buying it and I am now returning it. There are no step-by-step lessons in this book. It is way, way too advanced for beginners. Don't even consider getting this book."
2,Very graphic,"This is a very graphic book, like much much nudity. I was reading the reviews wondering if it was really bad and i didn't see anything about it. I think there should be fair warning on how much there is. Frontal male nudity, back male nudity, female nudity. I'm not prim or anything, but i can't open this book around my parents so that should give a good idea of how much there is in this book. Also, the book was in a kind of crappy condition when i got it. It wasn't falling apart but it was dirty and taped up."
4,"Good book, not the greatest style but technically worth it","Again, I'm not fond of Hogarth's personal style, especially with regard to women -- but aside from that, this is a good technical book (as are all his others) on how to draw a dynamic figure in space. Lots of good examples, and I'd also definitely recommend his ""Dynamic Light and Shade"" as a companion piece."
1,Eh.,"Besides just having a whole bunch of figures having dynamic gestures, it doesn't teach you how to draw the figure, the body properly, not enough! I prefer you get ""Drawing Dynamic Comics"" by Andy Smith! His book is great! He teaches you how to draw the body and how to move it and such. Amazing book!"
4,good book with little instruction,"this book increases ones ability to understand drawing ta figure in 3d with no model. however, if you have no clue where to begin with drawing a figure, then buy this book, and another. i learned basic figure drawing from ""how to draw comics the marvel way"", but there are a plethora of books for artist whose styles are more realistic. thank you very much"
1,This really stinks!,"Bought this for my wife who did not find it very therapeutic at all. It is a a non-compressable roll of material that is neither soft or comforting. When we put it in the microwave as the instructions say to do, it produced an odor so vile we immediately brought it outside, and spent the next 2 days trying to rid our house of the smell."
1,Bad Product and an even worse Customer Service,"Bought two of then in a span of 6 months. Both went bad. Spent 3 hours with customer services - approx. 2 hours on hold, and one hour talking to various reps. whose English pronunciations were sad (to say the least). Hopefully, after I send these back they will refund my money. If they replace these two units I suppose the story starts again !!I wish we have negative points - they would have aced it!"
2,Bad customer service!! Waste my time for nothing!,"My office purchased this EF4124 switch in June 2006. It was working fine without problem. But recently, our IT people unpluged it for re-routing wires, after they put the wire back, it was not working.Then we called LinkSys customer service for RMA, but they needed us to talk to the technical support first in order to activate the case ID. Ok, we would do it, but we had waited 30 mins, and no one picked up the phone. Before calling the technical support, we had talked to many different customer service representatives. Just felt like they were taking us around different departments.We may try to call back later for activating the case ID when we feel happier. Also, we need to fill out the online form with that case ID again.This switch is good, but you will feel disappointed from the Linksys customer service when it is broken."
2,Worked well for 4 years,"We have 4 of these. One of them just started having problems after 4 years. Hopefully the other 3 won't suffer the same fate. Otherwise, no problems."
1,Inconsistantly inaccurate!,"I purchased this scale for light industrial use. The scale was unable to be calibrated consistantly, and weight varied depending on the location on the weighing platform. We also observed using NIST calibrated weights that the inaccuracy percentage increased directly with the weight. Beware!"
2,Amateurish audio production,"This tape is poorly done. The tape quality is bad, and the production is cluttered with music and other background noise. Some of the readings are too fast, and some of the voices aren't very pleasant to listen to. No index is provided, so you have to listen to the tape if you want to know what's on it, and you have no way of knowing who's reading what. This is annoying if you want to read along with the audio.If you buy this, buy the audio download instead of the tape. Audible.com cleaned it up considerably. One nice feature is that if you burn this onto a CD, each poem is on a separate track, as is done with songs on a music CD, except for a few longer pieces that run over to a second track.For the record, there are 50 poems in this production. All but 2 of them, ""Asking For Roses"" and ""Spoils Of the Dead,"" are in the print book by the same title."
1,"A possibly OK movie, UNVIEWABLE on DVD","One of the worst DVD transfers we have seen to date. Subtitles were imprinted on the original film, and frames jump all over the screen, making them impossible to read. Not to mention overall bad quality of video and audio. Otherwise, could be a something for Chow Yun Fat fans."
1,I second that review!,"This transfer is absolutely horrid. I have probably hundreds of 'budget' dvds and this is absolutely the worst transfer that I have seen to date.To further amplify the first reviewer's comments, the subtitles are not only hard to read but generally IMPOSSIBLE to read. The bottom line of the subtitles is nearly always unreadable.Stay away from this and look for a Hong Kong version instead. Beverly Wilshire transfers are always among the worst of the budget dvd's."
1,God of killers,"If you are idiot! do not buy this DVD!!! it is the worst copy of this film!!! Poor images, and the subtitles look like a madmans breakfast!!! As they said to Big Julie, on the way to the Forum, dont do it Big Julie!!!"
4,Fun game,"This is a good, fun kids' game. I would say kids 5-10 would enjoy it most. I think it's fun and especially for kids who like Dora."
3,My plans to review these films have been delayed,"When I ordered this set on August 20, I planned on reviewing these musicals in just a few weeks. Four months later, they haven't been shipped. The latest estimate for a shipping date indicates that I'll get them next year."
2,Language too racey,"The description of the book seemed tame enough. However, I am glad I inspected the book before giving it ot our daughter for Christmas. Subsection headings like ""How to Be a B-tch Goddess"" with discussion about how to ensalve guys, etc. were not exactly appropriate. I was expecting some uplifting incantations for helping through the trials of teendom. This was truly a case of buyer beware. I would not recommend this book for anyone under 21."
2,Low quality,"I was disappointed by this DVD. It is a series of about 20 Shakespearean soliloquies by semi-pro actors. The production quality of the performances are average but the quality of the DVD itself is atrocious. The menus are backwards, non-existant or confusing. I thought the purpose of this DVD was to show the best soliloquies from Shakespeare but the choices don't include Othello and many others where there are great speeches to be found. Might be good for kids or others who have little exposure to Shakespeare (definitely not me). All in all, it's maybe worth half the price I paid for it. Anyone wanna buy my copy?"
1,Battery doesn't work,"I'm not a really lover of Motorola products, but i wanted to try this phone because i didn't need a lotoffeatures one, but i'm sorry it's disapointing, battery is always down, voice quality is poor.I don't return this because i'm not in USA, sorry don't recommend this for anyone."
1,lasted about 1 year before the lcd screen stopped displaying the letters corectly.,"I still use them so they function properly, I just can not read the screen. Also I left them unplugged while i traveled and then when I came back 6 months later, the batteries were dead and would not take a charge. Maybe you can never not charge there types of batteries. I replaced all the batteries with ones from radio shack and the units/phones work fine again. The screen LCD displays are burned out though the phone works."
1,Problem,"The phone I bought was the wrong one. I left sevral msgs, goth by phone and email but nobody ever returns my call. I just wat to retuen it.Please help"
5,Love my rack,Love my bike rack but. One of the best items I have bought. The only thing that could have been made better is the screw and locking system.
4,Great Story,I have seen this movie quite a few times. Worth Watching an oldie with great stars in it. Kevin Costner did a great job acting. Good story.
4,Rigourous,"For whoever likes the book by Feynman on path integrals, this book is very different. The author gives a much more rigouroustreatment of path integrals than Feynman, especially for the ""measure"" theory underlying these functionnal integrals. The scope of the book is pretty broad, even though the editor insists that the book is not an ecyclopedia. The author's style is much nicer than other textbooks on this subject like the one by Kleinart. The first 1/4 of the book (5 chapters )constructs the theory and its application to simple cases and its very readable by the amateur ( as myself)."
5,Great game for kids and parents,"this is an excellent game for you to play with any group of people. It is based on the rummy game but it is easier for kids because they don't have to keep up with the suites on the cards; they only have to focus on the colors. also there are no face cards, they are labeled from 1 to 13. It is an excellent game for developing visual/spatial skills because everyone plays off the tiles in the middle of the table. You can manipulate the tiles anyway you want. It is an excellent game."
4,This is a great game for everyone over 8 !!,Rummikub is a fun game which uses your tactical skills and imagination in many ways. It is competitive and oftentimes gives us a lot of laughs. I would highly recommend Rummikub. My family and I play it about four times a week after dinner.
5,Addicting,"It's a wonderful, challenging game and very addicting. The original version had different colors which included yellow, very hard to read when your eyes are tired from hours of playing! With this version, the red and orange can be mistaken for each other.The Rummikub fever has spread to several households and still going. I keep one in the car!"
5,Fun for ALL ages!,"This is a wonderful game, everyone in our family loves it, from the youngest (7 year old) to their grandparents (in their seventies). It's a great thinking game that takes the kids away from the TV and video games."
4,Buen Producto,"En general el producto es muy bueno, resulto facil de configurar.La apariencia es buena como para no dejarlo visible y que todos lo puedan ver, como para alardear jajajaja.Pero aun no se porque pero cuando me conecto con mi laptop me dice que la conexion esta a 130Mbps en lugar de la full velocidad del estandar -N que es 300Mbps."
3,"Average, could've been better...","I've been told that ""First Option"" which was directed by Gordan Chan was horrible. This time he produces in ""Option Zero."" The plot consists of a special branch of the HK police known as SB. After one of their members is killed, the group disbands, and three of the members try out for an elite group known as G4. First of all, I thought that the plot was loose, and that the ending was abrupt. I didn't mind the element of love that was added in between the star Cheung Chi Lam, his girlfriend Carman Lee, and a member of SB Monica Chan (who is secretly in love with him). There were so many things that should've been expanded on, such as the ending. G4 takes up about the last 20 minutes or so. The cinematography was off in a few scenes, which made me feel lost. What this movie needed was gun fight scenes John Woo style!"
1,Absolutely terrible-,"This movie is beyond bad. It's just plain long-stupid- and not funny. It takes a BIG ego to make a movie this awful and star in it. This is an embarrassment for Lewis -it's that awful; watch JL chain smoke act like he's so cool. This was the 60's remember? The time of the Beatles-Stones-Doors; and here's Lewis acting as he's part of the London hipster scene. Makes you cringe when you watch it; as I said, it takes a big ego to make a movie this rotten during those times. If I were JL, I would have bought every copy and burned them."
2,Pales in comparison,"I have enjoyed Goodman's other novels, and I was looking forward to this one as well. It just didn't hold up in comparison. I found that there were too many thinly developed characters, too many conveinient discoveries, too many predictible twists. Even the lush description I have enjoyed in previous novels, particularly The Drowning Tree, were absent.I am still a fan of Goodman's, barring this one misstep."
3,Cheap shipping info,Hi- Hopefully someone out there is still looking at these reviews! I would looove to know where the affordable shipping site is- could someone please email me the info at rebecca.sousa@thomson.com?? Thank you- this is just what I've been looking for!!
5,Please help,Hi everyone I to have been going crazy looking for the cheap website to order from. Could anyone please help me. My niece has had the one with the red lid since she was 15 months and is now eight and it is still in brand new condition . Now I have a little one that I would love to purchase the pink lid for. So if any one reads this could you please help me thank you. You can email me at Sheriberry1@msn.com
3,I thought it was boring.,"I wanted something fresh and unique fromthis book, I got something really lame. There are some very sexy scenes and you can tell the love, but it was boring and not well thought out."
2,Global Protection Night Light Glow in the Dark condoms sold by ToysNGamesEtc,"The Global Protection Night Light Glow in the Dark condoms shipped by Amazon for ToysNGamesEtc is only the three pack as shown in the picture, not the 12 pack listed under the product features. The price is a little high for a three pack, look around you can find them cheaper. I contacted Amazon and asked them to fix the features listing. It's been two weeks, they don't seem to care. The Stars are for value."
5,neolk,"As a member of the Caribbean community and someone who knows something of the phenomenon called Bob Marley, I must say that this documentary successfully illustrates the many facets of one of the greatest poets/songwriters/social commentators the world will ever know.Live on Robert Nesta."
5,My best photos have been taken with this lens,"There is little to say that has not already been said in previous reviews. If you have the means do try this lens. It will not disappoint you. Photographers are by nature very picky people, so the face that so many great reviews have been written for this lens should say it all. I own many Canon L lenses but sadly they have not made one yet that is as good as this lens in my opinion. I feel as if this lens captures the essence of the individual almost like it lets you see into their soul a little bit. I know maybe that sounds silly but may your results speak for themselves."
1,what on earth,"am I supposed to do with a fony Tarot application. I toatlly agree with the previous reviews. TO much hassel. I am getting into some flash application development, for which I got the taste after working my way through Friends of Ed's Dynamic Content Studion, which, by the way, is an EXCELLENT book....but this....c'mon"
2,Poor design,Very inconvenient to use. The hose and cord are much too short. I have to use an extension cord and move the pump around too much. The old model had a long cord and a long hose and was much easier to use.
1,Do not buy,"I purchased this inflator and I did not use it on a daily basis. One morning I was checking tire pressures on my wife's car due to a change in the temperature. And started to add air to one of the tires, I started to smell something burning and this compressor then stopped working and was very hot. We were using this inflator for only two months and as I indicated we did not use on a daily basis. So do not waste your hard earned money by purchasing this brand. Also the nearest service center was over 25 miles from our home and we live in the Chicago Area so do not count on customer support from Black and Decker."
3,"Pumps fine, but poor design","This unit works fine for occasional use. I live in the country and use it perhaps once a month to maintain proper pressure on my cars, riding mower, yard debris trailer, and other lawn/garden equipment. I don't mind the short power cord because an extension cord is almost mandatory for this sort of power tool and the way I use it. Don't trust the built-in tire pressure gauge, but you should always keep a separate pressure gauge because built-in gauges hardly ever accurate on any make/model. What drives me crazy about this B&D model is that I have to unravel the DC adapter cord to get at the power switch. I usually use the AC wall adapter for my needs. Having to also pull out the DC cord is simply poor engineering. B&D should seriously consider redesigning where they locate the on/off switch. I have owned this model for two years. It is still going strong. So, basic reliability is good. I would have given it 4 or 5 stars if it weren't for the DC adapter cord hassle."
1,Not working as described,"1) I tried it on my car tires and it stopped inflating just a few seconds after it was started, well below the pressure level I set at the built-in pressure gauge. I also tried it on my soccer balls and it also stopped below the pressure level.2) The pressure gauge pointer is about 1.5 mm wide and it is not clear which edge (upper, middle or lower) it is supposed to be aligned with the PSI range which does not have accurate readings itself. It claimed to be+/-3% accurate which is a joke."
1,Broke on first use,The first time I tried to use this the lever on the fill nozzle broke off rendering the whole pump useless.
2,Black & Decker Air Station Inflator,"I got this product because I wanted to be able to power it through the power outlet in my garage, rather than the car's cig lighter. It worked fine for the first tire. When I got to second tire and connected it to my tire air valve, the plastic connector broke. I figured I was going to get more uses out of this..."
2,Don't Use at high elevations,This is the second unit that I bought. The first one was one year old and died when I tried to inflate a wheelbarrow at a home located at 6100 ft elevation. I thought the unit had died a natural death until the second unit which was brand new also died. No where in the BD manual did it warn about not using at certain elevations.
1,Didn't work for me,May be ok for bike tires but that is about it. Tried topping off my motorhome tires with this unit and never finished. Both the 12 volt and 120 volt pump stopped working. Very disappointing. Also seemed to act erratic at times as mentioned in other reviews.
1,Wouldn't Buy This Again,"Obviously these inflators are not built to stand up under even light usage. Like several others reviewers, my inflator died in the middle of adding a couple of psi to a set of tires. Since this is something that is not user repairable, I have to take it 20 miles to the B&D repair center so they can order a new one under warranty. This is particularly annoying because this one was a replacement for my original one that had the same problem. I'm seriously considering just buying a different brand."
4,Great Product!!!,"I had owned an earlier model of the Black & Decker Air Station which is now more than ten years old & still works. I wanted to have a more portable unit that I could carry in my car on trips to my local biking trail & when camping as well as to fill the tires on my car in a pinch.The Air Station works very well & yes is a bit noisy as some have mentioned which my earlier model was as well, but you get used to it. The main thing is having a reliable pump you know is going to do the job. And Black & Decker has come through in it usual fasion with this model.I've read a review where someone had problems storing the electrical wiring & air hose connections in the units storage compartment. But I don't see a problem there as the 12.5 volt ""DC"" connector that plugs into the cigaret lighter for the unit will remain in the trunk of my car at all times leaving more than enough room for storage of the air hose & AC power cord.I intend to get many year of use from this product."
2,Two broke - won't get more,"The size and function of this thing work well and it was great while it worked. I used it for balls, bike tires and the occasional car tire.However I have had two now both of which have stopped working after about six/nine months. I suspect an internal fuse is blown but since it cannot be replaced the unit is effectively dead.It pains me to have put two in a landfill for such a short and light operating life.Please don't buy more and black and decker might take note and make a better product."
2,Not Reliable,"I thought I had found a great, convenient little unit for inflating car tires, balls, etc., around the home. But, to cut to the chase, this has been an unreliable unit. As other reviewers have noted, the deeply-buried internal fuse blows, rendering the unit useless. B&D says ship it back, but how many times can someone do that before it gets ridiculous? It's a bad cost-saving design, pure and simple. I'll invest more for a higher quality one next time. Lesson learned."
2,slowwwwww filling rate,I don't know if I got a lemon but this thing took an hour to blow up a small inflatable pool. I filled up a huge inflatable raft using a different compressor in about ten minutes. Returned this puppy the next day.
3,"NOT GREAT, BUT NOT BAD EITHER.","This little unit gets the job done, even though it does have a couple of flaws. The most glaring is the position of the on/off switch. I don't know what engineering genius placed the switch right underneath where the power cord attaches to the unit. So every time you turn it on or off you have to move the power cord out of the way, which is a real pain. I ended up duct-taping the cord to the housing. The other issue is attaching the hose to the valve stem of your tire. Make sure you cover all the metal threads of the stem with the hose or the inflator will not work. Aside from these issues, it's not a bad little device."
2,Needs to go back to the drawing board...,"There seems to be an inherent flaw in the concept of moving the dial to the air pressure desired and actually having the unit do this.I've now returned two units as the dial didn't work correctly and then unit over-inflated tires.the basic concept is great, just needs more fine tuning. I like the dual power concept and that is the primary reasoned I purchased it in the beginning."
4,Item works fine,"I had an old car in my garage that had not been moved in more than 20 years. It had five flat (and I mean flat) tires - including the spare. It pumped up the tires in practically no time. One of the tires does not hold air, so I have pumped it up several times. One of my other cars needed air and I pumped it up - no more going to the station - can now top off the tires at my convenience (have three cars). Also used it on a bicycle and it worked fine, but it is actually easier to use a hand pump for the bike. I think it does what it is supposed to do and does it very well. Nice design and easy to use. I recommend it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I'm on my third unit - and it just failed.This is a great little unit in that it runs on AC or DC, and has an auto shut-off.Problem is, they keep blowing fuses - even when used very carefully - and the fuse is permanently wired into a circuit board and can't be replaced. Bah!The idea of this machine is convenience - which it doesn't provide because of its poor electrical design and complete lack of reliability.Apparently some of the units work OK, but I suspect that these are units that are mostly used for very low pressure work. If you need to pump something up to more than 40 psi I suspect that most of them will fail. Too bad B&D; rates this thing for 160 psi. I'm really surprised that with all the excellent products they make that they are peddling this POS."
1,Not worth the cost,"The first time I used this product it failed. I was able to add air to one vehicle tire, but the Black & Decker ASI300 stopped working when adding air to the second tire. The Black & Decker ASI300 has not worked since."
1,Black & Decker Air Station,I returned this item when I saw that the part of the machine that attaches to the valve stem is made of plastic instead of metal. It seems inevitable that at some point this was going to fail.
4,Worth the money,Nice unit for the price. A little slow for pumping up automotive tires from a completely flat tire. Probably not uncommon for models in this price range. Nice looking unit. AC/DC capable. Slightly noisy but not too bad. Plastic interface for the connection to the tire is plastic is okay. I have not had it long enough to tell if there will be any problems with that. Automatic shut-off is a nice feature when attaining the proper set psi. The gauge is a little hard to see but ok. Seems to be accurate. Short AC cord. DC Cord is much longer.
2,More of a toy,"I bought this to replace a cordless inflator I owned that recently stopped working after many years. I liked the built in pressure gauge feature. When I took it out of the box to use, my first impression was that it felt like a toy. I tried to use it to inflate my car tire, I set the pressure to 32psi but it immediately jumped to over 80psi and then shut off. I took out my handheld pressure gauge and set the machine on its highest setting so it wouldnt shut off and proceeded to inflate the tire and checking the pressure every so often. Doesnt work as claimed, no hands free/no-worry/ set to pressure and forget....Not accurate, toy-like, not recommended."
1,B&D Air Station Review,"My new air station replaces one I bought about 15 years ago. Compared to the old one, the new one inflates much more slowly, has a harder to read gauge, is larger, and has much shorter cords. Definitely a huge step backward."
2,BlackDecker AS1300 Air Station Inflator,Great machine until it's 10th use. Simply stopped working and there is no way to repair it if out of warranty. Wasn't abused in any way. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! Spend a few more bucks and buy a better quality compressor!!
1,Why is Amazon charging full price for this but...,Why is Amazon charging full price for this but claiming it cost $90. Lowes sells it for $49 also. It was $40 about 3 4 months ago.
2,died after 3rd use (in 4 months),"It worked reasonably well for the short time it worked, and the other day while adding some air to the car tire, it just quit.There is no fuse on the AC side, and I opened it up to see there is a small fuse on the circuit board. The fuse did not look like something you can get at Radio Shack or home improvement store, so I will have to go to the B&D; Service Center to exchange it;it's a good thing it has 2-year warranty, but just to get to the service center will be a hassle as they do not have late or weekend hours.Somewhat disappointed."
2,Lasted for a year.,"The fuse was burnt after about 1 year of light usage. Replaced the fuse and it worked for another month. Then, the fuse got burnt again. Replaced the fuse again, and it didn't work. I just don't bother to fix it again and will have to buy a different brand this time."
1,Quality,Valve inflator head broke after the first use. They used thin plastic. I hope they will do some improvement on their quality . It's made in china anyway..
1,work in a pinch,"Main negative is that it is basically a 12V pump. The 120 plug in just feeds a 12V transformer [like a cell phone charger] and the pump is DC and the output is really low. Ok for a lawn mower or bike tire, but go have a sandwich and a nap if you're trying to pump up a car tire. Had a B&D; Air Station many years ago that was 120 only and while it does not have the pressure of a big pump, it got the job done much faster than this one. Anyway the 120 side went bad [after warranty] so can only use it with a battery.For $50 you can find a better air pump."
1,Do Not Buy - Cheap plastic nozzle,"The nozzle broke on only the second use. Unfortunately it was after the 30 day return policy so I am stuck with it. I should have listened to the countless other reviews on Amazon that said the same thing. The compressor itself seem alright, but it is useless when the nozzle breaks. I can't believe Black and Decker would make the most integral part of the unit out of such cheap material. I will never buy another Black and Decker product again. I couldn't be more dissatisfied with this product. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. If you are depending on this pump to fill your tires on the side of the road in case of an emergency, you couldn't pick a worse pump. It is highly unreliable."
4,Does a pretty good job,I bought this item to replace a battery operated unit which was a slow inflator and the battery wouldn't last long enough to top off the air in the tires of my three vehicles. This unit operates much faster but a little slower than I expected for an AC unit. It did not seem to overheat with continuous use on multiple tires. The air pressure guage is not accurate but once you got it set by trial and error it always stopped at the set pressure even though it didn't quite match the setting on the dial. The on and off switch is not located in a place where it can easily be turned on and off. Overall I am pleased with this unit and would recommend it for home use.
1,Bad Luck?,"I just picked one of these up at Lowe's. Everything else I've ever bought that was made by Black & Decker was great, except this. I tried to fill an air tank I had which maxed out at 150 psi, I set the dial to 120 and let it run. About 10 minutes later it shut down, which it should do when it reaches the desired psi setting. In this case it had reached 85 psi and shut off. The unit smelled and felt very hot. After letting it cool, I was not able to get it running again. It may have blown a fuse, I'm not sure, but in either case it should not have gotten so hot and shut off well before it hit it's own limits. It looked like a nice unit, very handy, and good reviews found here which is why I bought it."
1,Junk,"I bought this product 2 years ago for car and bike tires. It works ok, but is very loud and slow. It takes about 10 minutes per car tire, and that is just to raise about 5 psi each. The noise is so loud that you need to set the pressure and then leave the garage, unless you put on hearing protection. I did like the auto shut off feature. I could have lived with the slowness and the noise if it were not for the fact that they keep breaking. The first one broke after about 1 and 1/2 years of use. The replacement only made it about six months. They just stop working. I am done with Black and Decker. (Come to think of it, I have never had a B & D product that worked very well....)"
1,Poor construction,"I didn't use this compressor very frequently, maybe once every couple months. It annoyed me that the tube and attachments didn't fit correctly in the storage compartment, and that the power cord was not long enough. But after having this for around a year (and using it a handful of times) it just stopped working."
1,POOR QUALITY,"Pump lasted less than than a year. Stopped working after a few months on AC, then two months later quit working on DC. Threw it away."
1,Had it 2 yrs and it died,"Had it 2 yrs and it died. Tried to inflate my car tires and all it did was suck the air out, didn't have enough juice left to put any air in. Don't buy this"
1,fuse blew short of the warrantee,"Unit had been working well, but after 18 months fuse blew. No easy way to replace and apparently not covered under 24 month Warranty. Will not purchase this product again."
4,It is a very good product,"If there are somethings need to be improved, they are the accuracy of the pressure gauge and morespace for storing wires."
1,Stopped working,Bought the unit 3 months ago from a local home improvement store. I usedit 2 or 3 times a month to keep various tires properly inflated. It wasslow and noisy but got the job done. This morning it ran for about 5 secondsand quit working. I suspect a bad fuse or switch but it's unimportant now becauseit's in the trash and I'm going to invest in a good gas powered air compressor.You get what you pay for and B&D; needs to stick with drills etc....
1,This product stink,I bought this product because I need an air station trustable but guess what? it is MADE in CHINA. I receive and read the instruction I plug in start making a lot of noise and blow up in only 15 seconds incredible but what can you expect with someting made in china. Dont buy it stinks.
2,"Garbage - Worked 3 times, then burnt out","Giving it two stars for the two year warranty. Good warranty for $50 product. Still, this product is for minimal use, expect to use it only a few times."
3,AIR STATION,"wE HAD AN OLD AIR STATION BEFORE,AND IT LASTED FOREVER .tHIS NEW ONE IS HARD TO USE, GAUGE IS NOT ACCURATE AND IS CLUMSY. DISSAPOINTED"
1,say it ain't so.......,"wow. what an abysmal album, completely devoid of originality musically and good lyrics. save your money......"
1,Can anyone say sellout?,"This album was terrible. Enough said. I hated it. They have moved away from teh weezer of the Blue Album and Pinkerton to this utter crap that was made to try and relive their legend of the 90s. Sorry, but after they lost Matt Sharp, they lost their touch. You can't have teh same music without the originals. Well, at least they got rid of Mikey Welsh and replaced him with Scott Shriner, who is taking the band down the road of Nu Metal and 80s rock. That isn't weezer though. Weezer is weezer, the deep lyrics of Pinkerton ad the fun of the blue album is no more, and now they are shallow and insecure. Sorry to dissappoint you, but they suck now."
3,eh,"This cd is trying too hard to be catchy and commercial....I get confused when i read reviews saying it's like the blue album, because there's hardly any heaviness in the guitar, and all of the songs are extremely poppy....I know the first one was too, but this is ridiculous.....6 years for a 28 minute album is interesting."
2,Why bother?,"Catchy hooks can't make up for a lack of inspiration, and there is none to be found here. Singer/songwriter Rivers Cuomo seems to have completely removed himself emotionally from the music he's producing, and it's a shame, considering how great the first two Weezer albums were. Sure, they were a little immature as far as content, but every song had a heart and infected listeners like some glorious plague. This is a totally heartless album. ""Hash Pipe"" and ""Photograph"" are saved by a little bit of humor, but most of the music and lyrics are extremely bland (lyrics for ""Island in the Sun"" and ""O Girlfriend"" are outright embarrassing, considering Rivers isn't 15 years old). It's too bad Cuomo didn't challenge himself a little bit more, and it's too bad that fans had to wait almost 5 years for 28 minutes of soulless fluff."
5,Great but not the same,"I love the new cd. The only thing that's botherin me is that it sounds more rcok. It's a lot different from their first 2 cds,but then what can you expect, it's been awhile since their last cd and they've matured a lot and they're older. No matter what it's still a great cd. I love weezer. I always have and always will."
4,"Great album, just too short","It's a great album, I thoroughly enjoy it, with Weezers typical infectious pop grooves. Problem is that it's just too short, and the material wears out pretty quickly. Besides that, one of the better albums I've heard this year, my next best to Jimmy eat World."
3,Lacking,"When i first bought this cd, i thought it was the greatest thing in the world, but after a while i realized that it is terribly lacking. In this album, weezer has lost their great lyrics of pinkerton and the blue album as well as their complex music style. Every song on this cd sounds the same and all the guitar solos consist of merely the melody played on the guitar. I know i may offend people by saying all this, but seriously, listen to the first two albums...especially Pinkerton and you will realize the same thing. They have definitly lost something and i hope they get it back because they need it. Don't get me wrong though, i'm a big weezer fan. Just listen to the first two albums and see the truth!!"
2,What A Let Down,"I was anxiously awaiting this album and rushed to get it. Unfortunately, it lacked the depth of the previous 2 albums. The songs were short, very short. This album is done before I commute to work everyday. After reading that Rivers Cuomo had 100 songs written I found myself asking, ""Why ten songs, this short and this uninteresting?"" Crab is an interesting track. There are no real standouts on this record. Nothing like other songs such as THe World has Turned and Left me Here, My Name is Jonas, or Pink Triangle, Tired of Sex. The record seemed to fall into the rut of Blink 182 and behaved as if the attention span of the average American listener was only 2 or 3 minutes. Sorry guys this album just was not up to snuff. If I were you Rivers, I would jump back into the studio and release a few more of your other tracks!"
1,Boooooooooo!,I don't like this album or Emo. weezer and Emo are for suburban squares whose favorite movie is Ferris Bueller's day off and favorite book is catcher in the rye. These guys should of quit 8 years ago.
2,"Too little, too late?","Gone is the cleverness that made Weezer ""special"". Now little more than bubble gum rock from from a bygone era. But there are little gems in this otherwise mediocre offering. Hash pipe comes to mind with it's quirky vocals, and for some reason I think Island in the sun will appeal to all you Trashcan Sinatra fans out there.Smile is reminiscent of an Oasis B-side. Other than that, the tracks basically come together template style. Three chord, simple lyric music has been overdone overmuch as of late. I still enjoy this album because it's not challenging in the least. A simple listen when simple music is in order."
4,A little Sweet,"Although I like the new Weezer album entitled ""weezer"", (which is the best name by the way), I must say that it sounds a little sweet for me.....letting Ric Ocasek produce an album can only achieve one goal-it will definately sound ""poppy"". For any of you who love Guided by Voices-and I am a huge fan, you can relate to what I'm saying via the ""Do the Collapse"" album that Ocasek produced in 1999. I wish that guy would stay away from every band I listen to. He's a masterful producer, but tends to try to turn all bands into top 40 sound. Anyway, I like the album and am I weezer fan, all fans should and probably do have the album. Don't expect Pinkerton or even the Blue album, but you'll like it.Am I the only person who thought Pinkerton was the Best Ever?"
2,Lightweight Weezer doesn't cut it,"Nobody loved ""Weezer"" and ""Pinkerton"" more than me, and that's why I can say wholeheartedly that ""Green"" (or whatever we're supposed to call it) sounds like a bunch of dumb kids imitating Weezer. It has none of the intelligence, imagination, and wry wit of their first two albums. In fact, all it does have is Rivers Cuomo's reedy voice and the wall of guitars. Where are the riveting guitar leads? The neck-snapping shifts in dynamics? The delicate guitar intros and intervals? The intricate vocal arrangements and harmonies? And most of all, the sincerity, the warmth, and the passion?Green leaves me cold. Light and poppy, with no guts at all. Serious Weezer fans may as well pass this one up and wait until Cuomo starts getting serious about his songwriting again, and stops worrying so much about what his fans think. Teen angst. Get over it."
5,Excellent,"Other reviewers are having mixed reactions about this CD, but I think it is very good. There isn't a track I dislike, and some songs (""Island in the sun"", ""Photograph"", ""Hash Pipe"", and ""Smile"") are extremely catchy. Perhaps people have set their standards too high for this release, or they haven't grown to love the CD yet. The style has once again changed for Weezer, probably resembling their debut the most. Among the most noticable aspects of the songs are their shortness, and the solos (which are usually just the melody in the verse played over again). Despite this, the CD is very strong, and if you like Weezer, don't hesitate on buying the CD... it is definately worth the money. =W="
3,"Sounds like Weezer, but less than half an hour???","I liked the album, actually had burned several songs...(before), but had I known it was only 28 minutes, I would've just burned the rest. The songs are fine, think they learned from Pinkerton not to self produce (especially after only 1 album) and with Ric Ocasek producing again, it sounds great. But not even any special CD-Rom features make this a CD to wait on, I'm sure you can get a used copy for half price.... :)"
3,Blech!,"They really do sound like blink 182. THe reason I started to listen to weezer so much was because their albums were full of emotion and tempo changes. But the album is over-produced, songs 5-10 are identical, they didn't even change the knobs on the amps. The lyrics are so-so, there was no way this album could have lived up to my hopes, but I really do think this was an attempt to make a platinum record and not another pinkerton."
2,Kind of bland...,I thought the bad reviews were likely wrong because they were all written by pop-hating music snobs. They weren't. How many words is this now? Aaand done.
1,ugh,"this is a terrible album,it's like they weren't even trying,i didnt expect much from the first single hash pipe but i figured i'd get this album on vinyl just for whatever's sake cause i had just gotten a turntable. this is a completely unredeeming release, it's all filler, incredibly short and just boring. pinkerton rules and the blue one rocks too,you don't want this, believe me."
1,This is the biggest let down ever,"This cd is awful, it is straight-up the worst weezer cd ever, and i am ashamed for them because this cd is absolutely the biggest piece of trash i've ever heard by any band whom i like,(...)"
2,say it ain't so,"Ok, I certainly agree with a lot of reviewers, as well as my frinds that this album falls way short of what a highly anticipated album should be. Besides it only having a few short highlights, i.e. ""island in the sun,"" bits of ""crab,"" this ablum is too short--it's less than 30 minutes! wow, that says a lot. are they going to have a bunch of singles with a lot of b-sides?!?Not worth yours or my time...too late I already got suckered into buying this garbage."
3,BuyTripl3fastaction CD's,"I'm not sure what to make of this album yet. Hash Pipe and Island in the Sun are obviously the most catchy and the rest of the album does kind of blend together into one long similar song. Having seen them on tour, they've got some better stuff--""I Do"" may be a b-side, Christmas Song is on an ep--Both of these should have been included, that would've pushed it past 29 min. at least. Check out Tripl3fastAction's CD's ""Cattlemen Don't"" and ""Broadcaster""--both are GREAT if you're into Weezer/Nirvana/good rock. When's the next Weezer album??"
2,Dissapointing,"I'm sorry, but I had very high expectations for this album, as the Blue Album and Pinkerton are two of my favorites of the 90's. This one just left me flat. I know they tried to go back to something like their first one (even with the same producer), but they didn't come close. These songs just have no heart and soul, especially compared to their previous efforts. I know it's really not fair to compare them to their past cd's, but it's impossible not to do when they've fallen off so much. For what it's worth, ""Simple Pages"" is a pretty good song, but without it I would have given this cd one star. In a sea of soundalike pop/punk bands, this makes out ok, but this is a far, far cry from ""Undone"" and ""Tired of Sex."""
2,Disappointing!!!!!!,"I have been a Weezer fan for a long time, and I can't believe that this is what they give us after 5 years. This album is just plain weak--the first album had great well crafted songs, and Pinkerton was great because it was raw and emotional---but this album is derivative, and the songs sound like they should be on a soundtrack. ""Hash Pipe"" and ""Island in the Sun"" are the only ones that standout and sound different. I am very happy that Weezer is back, but I am upset with this album...let's hope Weezer works to their potential on their next album."
5,A wonderfully emotional and lyrically complex album,"In the style of their second record, Pinkerton, the new self titled CD by Weezer is a truly amazing album. Lead singer/song writer Rivers Cuomo succeeds again with an emotionally complex performance. The musical talents of Cuomo, Brian Bell, and Patrick Wilson are now complimented beautifully with the raw talent of newcomer Mikey Welsh on bass guitar. For Weezer fans and music fans in general, this is a must buy."
3,Weezer?,"I grew up with the blue album and ""Pinkerton"" and now this album comes along, and I feel cheated. Some of the songs are catchy, but there's a good amount of filler on this record. The first four tracks are on a good start, but the rest falls flat. They really didn't put enough thought into this LP, and for me, nothing will be able to re-create the magic of singing along to any of the songs on their first record. And what's with ""Hash Pipe""? That's not Weezer! That's Rivers Cuomo singing along to Green Day!"
1,aw geez...,"One day, a band called Weezer was created. They made wonderful pop music with an equally wonderful rock. The band continued to do this with 2 albums. In the course of that time, other people thought, ""I want to sound like them!"" So many people tried to copy the weezer sound and was heard as a weaker version of the original. Somewhere along the line weezer lead singer Rivers exclaimed, ""I'm so greatful for these bands that want be just like us, i think i'll return the favor and try to sound like them!"" Thus, the Green Album is born. An album that sounds like a band trying to sound like a band trying to sound like Weezer."
4,Speechless,"I just don't know what exactly to say about this. Their previous two albums were the soundtrack for my life for the last 7 years. Now i have a new soundtrack. Upon first listen, i was upset, because the lyrics are pretty much trash. I know Cuomo has often said that he sacrificed the lyrics in order to make better melodies, but the melodies are not THAT good, not enough to justify the lyrics.It is a great album though, much closer to the sound of the debut ""Blue Album"". Very short pop tunes. That's it. So when taken at that angle, it's an excellent record. Is it as good as Pinkerton? No. If you are looking for innovation turn to The Rentals ""Seven More Minutes"" or Nada Surf's ""Proximity Effect"". This is a pure pop record, all fun, no frills."
4,I've had better but its alright,"The songs tend to be much of the same music. Weezer tried to make the cd sound more like the first than the second. The songs are catchy and nice to listen too. They're not noise in the background. If you LOVED the first two albums, this is a a good buy. But if its your first weezer cd get the Blue one its much better.OH AND THIS ONE IS WAY TOO SHORT!P.S. I don't think weezers done, if you want a great song look around for Jamie by Weezer, that still has to pop up on a Weezer CD, its one of the best songs they've written recently"
3,Great Album.. Too Short,"Weezer's new cd is the pre-mature [...] of the music business. With their latest attempt to be successful the geek rockers fall short. Though the cd is overall good and quite relaxing it is far far too short. Once you get pass how short is is it can best be described as relaxing Sunday music. It's smooth rhythms and melodies are often quite relaxing. The voices are smooth and it makes a good, relaxing listen. The group's hit single ""Hash Pipe"" is one of the better songs on the album but some of the other good ones are ""Island in the Sun,"" ""Photograph"" and ""Don't Let Go"". Overall this cd makes a good listen anytime and it relaxes you. Lyrically wise many of the songs have to do with girls, a favorite subject of the geek rockers."
4,Thank God for Weezer,"Along with a small handful of other bands (notably Dave Matthews Band, No Doubt, & Red Hot Chili Peppers), Weezer is one of the very few mainstream rock bands that still matter. Compared to the tuneless sludge (Creed, Matchbox 20) and disposable trend-rock (Sum 41, Blink 182) that has been invading the radio waves over the last five years, it is so refreshing that Weezer returns to show rock bands how it's done.Weezer has always gotten the most important thing about rock music right - have great songs. This album, although considerably short by today's standards, has great songs - fun, direct, and full of life. From the blunt rock of ""Hash Pipe"" to the upbeat ""Photograph"" and ""Knock Down Drag Out"", Weezer gets it right on every song. ""Island on the Sun"" is the album's highpoint - a beautifully understated song.Pick this album up if you want to be reminded of a time when every song on a rock album was catchy, fun, and most importantly, well-written."
1,STOP!,"Oh my god.DO NOT buy this album unless you have money to throw away.If you are like me,you might decide to pick this cd up because ""Hash Pipe"" was so addictive.Well,unfortunately,you won't find any other songs on this album of the same style.Melodically,the best songs on this album are ""Hash Pipe""(nice singing,but in a quirky way;kinda cool,unusual lyrics) and ""O Girlfriend"" (infectious,dreamy). A couple others are catchy,but get old quickly.This is the type of stuff you'll hear played at a jr. high school dance;musically puerile,but very get-stuck-in-your-head-able.I admit,I'll probably be singing ""O Girlfriend"" until the end of time,but frankly,there are simply not enough good songs here for the album to be worth more than a few dollars."
4,You Know Its Going To Be Great,"You know this album is going to be great because Weezer have never really put a foot wrong. Weezer have an ever increasing fanbase that has made this albums impact huge. The highlights on this album for me are Don't Let Go, Photograph, Crab Smile and Hash Pipe. If you are unsure about this album, but it anyway as you are bound to find someone who will appreciate it even if you don't"
3,Listen once. Then file away.,"This is a decent album of guitar pop, but after five years of waiting it's not enough. There is nothing that makes me want to come back to this record, unlike Pinkerton or the Blue Album. Where is the innovation? Where is the experimentation? Don't tell me what Rivers wants to write ""simple happy songs,"" and that therefore I should like this album. A disappointment. You could do better with Superdrag."
3,Well: give Pat's music a chance,"Ok, the Green Album is what I expected Rivers to write: pressured by Interscope and trying to come in the actual ""teen neo-rock music market"". It's done. The best thing I've heard from the Weezer staff after Pinkerton is Special Goodness.Yeah, Pat's band. Excelent album without a label which I downloaded from Special Goodness' site. Rivers, if you are 'Tired of x', give Pat a chance, he is a great musician too. I would have prefered to wait 5 yrs for Special Goodness' ""Pay no mind"". EXCELENTO !!"
5,"Great, but short","Weezer is one of those bands that just explodes and then just as quickly disappear. But unlike most bands, Weezer has once again exploded, proving that they are here to stay.It's been nearly five years since they released Pinkerton, and many thought that this CD would never come out. Well they were wrong, and I'm glad. It's been a while since I've listened to a CD that was so fresh, pleasing, and totally different. Only Weezer could pull of their sound, and they do it magnificently. There is not a bad track on the CD. Hash Pipe is the definite standout but many others also deserve to be singles. Overall nothing is wrong with this CD except for one thing. It's less than half an hour long! But after one listen you can forgive the briefness due to the awesome songs."
3,Island in the Crappy Solos,"Yes, I'm sure many of you rabid Weezer fans will give this album 5 stars just for being Weezer, but honestly, it's not as good as their previous efforts. I've been a Weezer fan since the beginning and still am, but this stuff just doesn't cut it. Gone are the killer solos, the sweet bridges and the attitude. Now we just have 10 songs, all following the exact same pattern: 2 measures of intro, verse, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, guitar solo of the melody, verse, chorus, chorus, end. Check it out for yourself, they are all the same. It's ridiculous. I still like Weezer, but this is not what I was hoping for."
4,Dont be fooled and buy this for the radio songs,"Blue and Pinkerton are awesome, solid CDs (Pinkerton being the best), but what is this nonsense!?Only the singles are good (and Dont Let Go is OK), the rest are SO cheesy and its so obvious how rushed and overproduced the CD was. Every song follows the same formula and has the same cheesy solo copying the verse.The CD is a joke. Dont be fooled and buy it for the singles like I did, the rest of the songs sound NOTHING like Hash Pipe and Island In The Sun."
3,"I hate to say it, but it's true","The greatest thing this album did was bring Weezer back to its fans. If it needs to be a hastily written attempt at their first album's pop feel, then so be it. But come on! To those of you who think this album is wonderful . . . the lyrics make no sense, every, and I do mean EVERY, guitar solo is the same melody as either the chorus or the verse, and (yes, I understand it can't be helped, but the fact still remains) the loss of bassist Matt Sharp's unique and almost soprano voice damaged their sound. The songs are still pretty good, despite these immediate flaws. In fact, I like listening to most of them . . . on the Weezer mix disk I made with all their other best stuff on it, but I never put the Green Album in my cd player anymore."
2,Dont buy this cd. Stick with pinkerton and blue,this cd sounds nothing like weezer except for photograph and island in the sun. Knock Down drag out sounds like a blink182 song. Looks like either weezer lost their formula or they completely sold out. hopefully their next release will be more like the other two.
1,pales in comparison,"weezer's [=w=, henceforth] blue album was the consummate pop record of the 90's; their next album, pinkerton, was an angry-but-subtle recording which is, in many =w= fans' minds, their best... .... all 3 of =w='s albums are 10 songs long, but unlike the 2 previous ones all 10 songs on the green album are 3 minutes or under, resulting in a 25-minute album. this should have been labeled as an ep, not an full-length album. i hate to write such a negative review but i was severely disappointed by this poor effort. ....the one positive ramification my buying this album had was it prompted me to repurchase =w='s 2 previous releases, and in the process, reassess them. .... now go and buy yourself the blue album, pinkerton, or preferably both."
2,"Talk about a ""walkthrough"" album.........","Sounds like the band showed up for recording a little drowsy every day. There's about ZERO emotion conveyed through the record. VERY flat. It's a pity that Pinkerton was largely ignored because it blows this album right out of the water. Can you say ""pandering to the masses""? Almost sounds like someone forced them to make this album."
2,what happened?,"the blue album was excellent. pinkerton was better, one of my top 5 albums of all time i think. the new green album was about the most disappointing release i've ever had to suffer through. 10 songs that all have the exact same structure. 10 songs with guitar solos that mimic the vocals exactly. this sounds like an album that took a couple of weeks to put together. i would have given it one star except for the fact that it's catchy, but being catchy does not redeem the fact that it's unbelievably weak music. i would rather they had not released another album if it could have prevented this travesty. weezer has gone from a clever and talented band to just another pop rock group. i think they were hitting that hash pipe a little too much while they made this. bring back the old weezer!!!!"
2,"Nice fragrance, poor quality","The fragrance is warm and pleasant, however the fragrance fades quickly, as if it were a knock-off and not a genuine brand product."
4,Yummy!,"Smells great! I just ordered some for my husband. He's been wearing Obsession for Men for years, but the sample scent of Tommy Bahama is so sexy! I can't wait to receive it!"
3,Complementary readings to Keegan's book,"There are already many good reviews to this book, so I will only suggest reading the following books in addition to Keegan's book: 1) above all, ""War in human civilization"" by Azar Gat; 2) ""War before Civilization. The Myth of the Peaceful Savage"", by Lawrence Keeley; 3) ""How War Began"" by Keith F. Otterbein; and 4) ""War and Peace and War: The Rise and Fall of Empires"" by Peter Turchin."
3,Keegan goes beyond his Expertise,"A History of Warfare by John Keegan is a quality history as far as it goes. Keegan does a fine job describing the ins and outs of warfare as well as its evolutionary process. As always Keegan writes well in a very readable manner. His description of the warfare on Easter Island and its resulting destruction of the Polynesian civilization was especially appealing. However, Keegan falters when he attempts to move from historian to anthropologist or psychologist. While his attempts to explain differences in warfare by referring to cultural or psychological differences certainly have a place in understanding a history of warfare, Keegan as an historian probably isn't the person to make the argument. His explanations at times seem simplistic and border on arm chair psychology."
4,Good source about this subject,"I read this book, translated to the portuguese, here in Brazil.Good source about general military history.This books talks about military history, since stone age war, until almost our times.With no prejudices, and almost unbiased, this book is good.The problems in this book are small.There's some thing in it who are outdated, and this book sometimes calls too much about minor subjects.After all, this book is good and easy to read."
2,Disappointing,"I am surprised that one who has studied war so much and so well (The Face of Battle), understands it so little. After reading this very wide-ranging but spotty book, I remained unconvinced that wars are simply cultures expressing themselves. The emphasis on cultural expression, whatever the cost in military effectiveness, was overdone.Keegan could have read a little further in areas beyond his expertise. For example, there were plenty of reasons for the use of Mamluks (slave-soldiers) that made excellent military and economic sense, but which are ignored by Keegan, who prefers to believe that Muslims would under no circumstances fight with fellow Muslims. And did anyone else find his portrayal of Aztec warfare suspicious?"
2,A regrettable read,"War...or at least the kind that's mustached and carries a swaggerstick. A hard read for those who do not buy Keegan views on war. There's too much of his own coloured personal opinion in his thesis to be quite convincing. It isn't hard to see why he ascribe to the view he does (ie ""Fog in Channel; Continent cut off"") but it makes for poor history for those who really wish for a clearer understanding of war."
1,MOST BORING GAME EVER,I bought this game for my kids for Christmas 2012. And we are a family BIG on playing board games we have a closet full. This game was just boring its purpose of how to win made no sense to use . Cheap
3,"Great read, very funny","I have recently finished this book by W Boyd, which I thoroughly enjoyed, the flawed characters, the humour, and the irony, I seriously laughed out loud a few times. I'm certainly going to read more from this author."
4,I laughed out loud,This is a very very funny book - I found myself laughing out load several times when reading it. I see some reviewers have taken exception at the characters and stereotypes but it is all in good humour and the central character does have some depth and develops during the course of this novel. Boyd writes flowing prose and you will enjoy this book.
1,"Horrible print, void of fresh ideas",Stick with The Women's Comfort Book. This could be the most disappointing book I've ever bought. It's also truly ugly. Not a nurturing experience at all.
2,Dickies uniform pants (boys 8-20),"The dickies pants are made of good quality durable material ,however the zippers are are of poor quality.The zippers were hard to zip after 1 wear and did not zip at all after that.I would not recommend purchasing this pants."
4,rvalentine,"Excellent fit for husky boy, solid heavy material, will hold up through the school year. a little stiff but it does bother my son. Good for play and school"
4,Good family game,Played on a small travel one before so this is great and adds another channel to it for more challenge.
1,bumbed out and disappointed,"I ordered The Black Pirate that was suppose to star Terrance hill and Bud Spencer,but amazon sent me The Black Pirate starring Douglas Fairbanks Jr. which was made in the 1920's.Not interested in this movie,wasn;t what i ordered.Amazon has done good on everything else so far,but this movie."
2,Disappointed,"I thought I'd like this tacklebox, but I do not! The entire unit is softside which makes it lightweight (good), but when you remove something from the bottom section the entire thing collapses because there's no longer anything to hold it up. I also found that the cloth gets dirty/wet. I used this tacklebox for a long weekend of camping/fishing and immediately retired it upon my return home. If I hadn't used it, I'd return it."
3,happy but not,We were happy with this product for the fact that it held three suitcases and various other items and allowed us more room in the vehicle for the family. However we were disappointed that after traveling from Michigan to Massachusetts there was a tear in one of the seams. I expected to be able to use this more than once.
3,3.5 stars... Strap broke on day #1 :(,"I could have pulled too hard, but seriously - the straps should not be THAT weak! First time using it and one of the clips broke apart when I tightened it. Other than that, it worked fine for us. Part of the trip was rainy, but our stuff (two sleeping bags, medium cooler, pillows, blanket, tent, two camping chairs, and a few other random items) stayed dry and secure. I tied down the extra strapping, and didn't notice any flapping sound whatsoever. Overall I'd give it a 4-4.5, but with the broken clip I have to dock it a bit. Definitely worth the price, though... Can't argue that!"
2,good value,"The bag served it's purpose well. It freed up much space in the vehicle and everything stayed dry in soaking downpours.It was hot and the bag is dark black and shiny causing me to be sweaty and irritable. I'd suggest loading in a garage if you have one or in the shade.It took considerable time to adjust the straps (we chose to unload at night and store it while in the hotel).The front collects a lot of bug bodies.The material wore where the straps laid, so we will have a few places that will not be waterproof for our next trip (duct tape will fix that!)."
4,Great Space Solution,"We purchased this cargo bag for a 500 mile, early March trip from VA to VT. It was super easy to handle taking it up and down from the rooftop, easy to load and zip, and easy to attach to the roof rack. It is VERY durable for loaded boxes and suticases, and the perfect size for the top of our Traverse. On the way back we followed a nasty band of driving rain and wind all the way home, and I wondered just how ""waterproof"" it would really be. To my surprise when we unloaded the bag there were only a few small puddles that had formed from the 30+ MPH wind gusts/rain. GREAT bag for the money! It's only missing a fifth star because of the few puddles."
5,It's waterproof!,"I was a bit nervous to see how this would perform, but it proved itself out well. Driving through Florida summer thunderstorms on the Interstate is as good a test as any. I had no wet luggage and no issues whatsoever. Otherwise, it was easy to set up, load, and take down. I am real happy with this."
5,Great buy,"GREAT BUY, rugged,easy to use, plenty of room. Fits perfect on a Toyota FJ Cruiser roof rack, quite, straps stay tight during travel and water proof"
4,Like It!,Just completed our 2000+ mile journey from Texas to Massachusetts. The bag held up very well. Still looks like it came out of the box. I was thinking that that much time at high-speed and sun exposure would take somewhat of a toll. No bug splatter or stain or color fading. Did run into some rain and contents were just as dry as when packed. Zippers and tie-downs work well. Very pleased with the product. I just wish they'd make a larger size.
2,Fine but not weather proof,"Just drove 300 miles with it this weekend- not reAl easy to install as the straps are not easy to adjust. Fits a lot of stuff but we drove in high winds, rain and then snow and the inside was wet. I did wrap something's in garbage bags which helped but something's were wet.More -found a small tear in the top of the bag. Had to take another star off - bag ripped after one rd trip-'if I had to do it again would go hard case"
4,Worked Perfectly!,"This was great! Used it in a cross country move, no leaks! After the trip was over it was very easy to clean. Worth the purchase for sure!"
4,Great value - wish it was a little bigger,"My family was driving to Martha's Vineyard with 7 people in the car and needed to claim some space inside the car for people! This bag did the trick - very easy to install on the roof of our Town and Country Minivan. At no time did we have any trouble with straps coming loose or making noise. Didn't get to see how waterproof it was since it didn't rain during our ride up or back to NY. Only downside was the size, would have liked it to be a bit bigger, but definitely a great value for the minimal cost."
1,cargo bag mess,"I bought the cargo bag to carry my golf clubs and give me more room inside my van for luggage. As soon as I hit 55 mph, the bag started flapping and making a terrible noise on my roof. I fixed that by using extra tie downs and the noise abated. Then when I tightened the cargo bag straps, one of them came loose from where it was supposed to be adheared to the bag, so I had to throw that away. Then when I unzipped it to get out my clubs, they were very hard to extract. The solution to my frustration and disappointment with this product was to remove it from my roof and throw it away. I guess if you go cheap, you get cheap."
1,YOU NEED TO HAVE A ROOF RACK ON YOUR CAR,"It 9pm. I'm leaving on vacation tomorrow morning. I just opened the box and it says, ""DO NOT install on a car without a roof rack."" My car doesn't have a roof rack.It would have been nice if the product description said something about this."
4,Keeper cargo bag,"Spacious, easy to install and pack--did it myself in no time. Straps were easy to fasten and tighten. I was confident in the tightness of the straps, but the ends of the straps flap around noisily--I had to stop and kind of tie up the ends(there should be some kind of built in mechanism to account for this). I didn't notice much effect on miliage. All in all, very good product for the money."
2,roof top carrier,"It is hard for me to give this a 2 star as I really liked the product and the design of it. After taking it on a trip of 350 miles, and I only packed soft sided items in it, like my duffel bag, sleeping bag, boat cushions, things like that, I took it off the car and noticed the front seam had a 2 inch rip in it and one of the velcro tabs came off. So, while I would like to think it was an individual flaw and get it replaced, I am asking for a refund as I'm afraid to try another one"
4,Can't give it 5 stars!,"I'm giving this product 4 stars because somehow some of our clothes in our suitcases got wet. The amount of water was minimal and our cloths were only damp. I'm not sure how the water got in but I do know that only the suitcases on the bottom were the ones that got wet and I did not see any visible holes. Overall this product did the job for our trip from MA to SC, with minimal dampness to items stored at the bottom of this bag and it allowed us to have more room inside our crossover vehicle for items we needed easily accessible during the ride. Not once did the straps become loose or need adjustment. I would recommend putting extra plastic inside the cargo bag to keep everything completely dry. The best part is I was able to fold the cargo bag up and store it in the box it came in and put it out of the way until next time."
4,Adjusting for a Subaru Forester,"I didn't check the illustration showing how this carrier fits the car top racks. The racks need to have space beneath them so you can pass the straps around them. My Subaru Forester does not. However, I went to my local fabric store and purchased some 1"" wide nylon strapping and strap adjusters and made extensions. With these I could bring the side straps inside the car and hook them around the handles above the inside of the door and this worked well. However, the loaded carrier sat outside in the rain and somehow the rain wicked along the nylon straps and inside the car and some items inside the car got wet. The items inside the carrier remained dry.I thought I could purchase 1"" wide parachute clips and just clip my extensions to the existing clips on the carrier. However, the design of the clips differed enough that the clips wouldn't fit. With the strap adjusters I was able to make the connections."
2,Not that great,"This CD has Mark Lindsay and Tom Kolb re-doing Paul Revere and the Raiders' songs. It's interesting to see how much their voices change, but I was disappointed when I heard these songs. This appeared to be a great collection, but nowhere on any advertisement does it give sound clips or say that these are new recordings. If you like re-makes go ahead and buy this but if you question whether you like re-makes pass on this. Go with the Columbia or the Legend of Paul Revere CDs which have their original greatest hits."
3,city to jungle,"The second DVD in this juvenile series continues the story of Haruka, the pre-teen girl who is apparently the sole human being left alive in the world after the great war. In this second set of eight 12-minute episodes, she and her robot companions, a mix of humanoid and non-humanoid surrogate mom and dad, brother and sister, are forced to leave their cozy ruined city home by an apparently natural disaster. They find a working aircraft to take them, and eventually end up on a jungle island where, surprise, they find at least one more human survivor.So far the heroine remains sweet, sensitive, and bland as toast. (I think the actress who does Haruka's English voice deserves kudos for a very good performance, though.) There's not a lot of plot to pick at. The side stories appeared to be poking half-heartedly at the notion whether her robot friends have emotions or souls. The introduction of a human boy near the end of this DVD may give the series some direction."
3,Kurogane communications,This got here so fast. I was surprised. These cartoons have simple Japanese so I use them just to hear and practice. Good stuff!
2,not an exact replacement,ordered this pump for my 2006 Buick LaCrosse CX the pump is shorter in height than the origanal an therefore will not snap into place.
3,Bad service,My two stools were missing hardware and had a piece broken. Amazon said I would have to deal with the supplier which I have for almost 3 weeks and my stools remain unassenbled. I won't order from Amazon againBill Black
5,Coaster Bar Stools,"The Coaster Bar Stool chair with swivel arrived quickly and in good condition. It took about 20 minutes each to put the chairs together, but the assembly was easy. I am pleased with the quality and looks of the chairs."
3,Not quite Vampire a go-go,"I had seen all the other Hammer Dracula films before finally seeing this one and I was not exactly sure what to expect, but I think it is a little better than I thought. The beginning is terrific and the ending is one of the better demises for Dracula. The film looks very sharp, fine photography. The film's strongest point is certainly Peter Cushing, his performance is extremely well-done. Christopher Lee is once again used way too little. The acting done by the group of young people ranges from average to terrible like Scott Noame as Johnny Alucard, which is about as clever as Ed Wood's villain Dr. Acula from Night of the Ghouls. Of course their is too much funky music, late 20's hipsters acting like teen-agers and cheesy humor. Still this is better that I thought and it certainly has it's share of moments."
4,Dracula at Church!!,"Okay, Hammer was really scraping the bottom when it decided to do this one (don't ask me why they made the Satanic Rites.)But this flick isn't bad, despite the gaps in continuity, the lame supporting performances and the lack of depth.If you have the others in this series, you need to get this one."
3,Kind of Cheesy,"In the hope of finding fun music for my younger ballet classes, I thought I hit the jackpot with this CD. Wrong. It is very cheesy and hokey and the vocals are seriously lacking. The instrumentals are great and a lot of fun but it just wasn't what I expected it to be."
4,"Great Toy, but...","I'm not sure how long I've owned this buggy, but my son who is three years old still loves going around the block in it.It is a little small for him - his feet don't fit the places for them.But the biggest issue I have with this buggy is the tires. Solid plastic tires. They are very loud on anything except the smoothest concrete. I can't hear anything my son is saying - and he's a talker so I have to stop a lot to listen to him.So, this would be the ultimate push toy, if:a) It was designed with rubber or air-filled tires.b) It was designed with larger platforms for my child's feet.While he does enjoy riding his tricycles, he still likes his little red car - and it reminds him of the Wiggles big red car."
5,One of our favorites,"Our son got this from his grandparents when he was about 11 months old. He loves it. Some mornings he climbs in it while I'm making breakfast and sits there looking at me as if to say ""Can we go now"".The hard plastic wheels and hollow body do make for a noisy ride, but that is pushed by the wayside when considering how much our son enjoys this toy. It's very durable and we expect it to last for many fun-filled years."
3,"bulky, loud...","We bought this car for my son's first birthday. He likes it a lot and it has a good strap to keep him in, however it has its faults. First of all it is huge and doesn't fold up. Next, it is extremely loud on the sidewalk. Also, and this is the absolute worst, my son can take his foot and touch the sidewalk with his shoe as I'm pushing him (he has ruined several pairs of shoes this way) which really causes drag. If I were to buy a toy such as this again then I would go with the more expensive version of this (the similiar car that's 59.99) b/c they can't drag thier feet and it's more convertible."
3,"Good stroller buggy, bad independent ride-on","My 16 month old son likes to ""drive"" around in this toy, however there is no way he could use his feet to ""drive"" it himself. It makes a good, but loud stroller. The plastic wheels tend to give a noisy ride on conrete. For a ride-on toy that can be used independently, I wouldn't recommend the Push-around Buggy."
5,Great Fun for Little Drivers,"My son hates to sit in strollers. However, he can't wait to ride in his buggy. The buggy is noisy on concrete and a little difficult to turn because the wheels don't swivel, but we couldn't be happier when we go on neighborhood walks. The seatbelt secures him comfortably. It's lightweight and easy to pack in the trunk of a car. Moreover, the Step2 company is easy to reach and extremely responsive to its customers if there is a problem. It's a great product in every way."
5,Perfect for when your toddler is Driving YOU Buggy !!!,"I bought this 2 years ago for my 1st daughter who immediately LOVED riding in it. I am now using it for my 2nd daughter who Loves it even more! Both my children hated being ""strapped in"" their strollers which made taking a simple stroll around the block a Major Endeavor. But both my toddlers would happily sit in the buggy (with the seat belt on)- I think they really feel like they are driving vs. being pushed around. My 13-month old recently CRAWLED from one end of our driveway (under my watchful eye of course) into our garage and tried to get into the Buggy all by herself. We also have several friends who purchased it after their kids rode in it at our house. The wheels are a bit noisy on the sidewalk but ""If your child is NOT fussing, do you Really Care?"" Buy It. Trust Me on this One."
5,You got to get this buggy,"My son loves this buggy. We take our daily walks in this buggy. We go to the park, the mall, the grocery store, etc in this buggy. It totally replaced the stroller the moment we bought this. It is extremely durable, easy to clean, and fun for the kids. The trunk is great as well. Whenever we go for a walk, my son likes to put his water and snack in it. You can put sand tools, a lite lunch, or toys in this trunk. The strap holds the child right around the belly button, so it isn't uncomfortable. Very easy to adjust. Best buy!"
1,Disappointing,"I agree with the other 2 reviews (at this time), there are much better live recordings of Giant out there, but there are some very worthwhile moments on this CD for the true fan. If you're on a CD budget, get this one last, but at least try to hear it once. And shame on the person(s)releasing it without trying to improve on the recording/mastering quality."
2,Have to give it a 2 out of 5,"I love GG! This is a bootleg gone public. Lousy sound quality with extra noises and stuff from the BAD recorder. GG is close to flawless though, which is why it gets a two. On spin? No comment..."
1,Unreadable,"I've read all of Deaver's books eagerly awaiting the next one. This one however, I've tried to read many times and just cannot garner enough interest to keep reading. I even checked to see if it was one of his first efforts at writing books. For me it was just unreadable and very disappointing!"
3,Hard to review as read on and off during travel in Europe,This book is not bad if you have time to sit down and read it rather then read it on and off.But it did drag on in the end when the killer is still at large when suspects get caught and died or killed off.Too many false leads so became a bit repetitive and thought why doesnt Deaver just finish it?Caught the wrong person once or twice but thats enough and finish it.
4,A nail biting Deaver thriller,"Bill Corde is a former big city cop turned small town detective who is assigned to investigate a murder of a local college girl. Although signs point to a cult killing, Corde knows better and he closes in on the real killer. He discovers the victim has left him with a number of suspects and as he gets closer to the killer, the killer gets closer to him. In typical Deaver fashion, there are twists and turns with every new chapter. You are kept guessing until the very end as to the identity of the murderer. The book is a smooth read and it held my interest throughout. Deaver conveys real suspense and dread by bringing the Hero's children into the sights of the villain. Deaver and suspense fans will find this as a book worth reading."
3,Probably the weakest of his books,"I've read all of Deaver's books and this is probably the weakest. That, however, is like saying that a painting is one of Da Vinci's weakest -- the guy is so good that even his earlier, poorer stuff is still worth reading. I found this book fun and gripping, but it has the same flaws (hard to empathise with the characters enough to really get into the story) as his other earlier work.This is quite fast-paced (not as fast as his later work) and quite chilling in parts. He really knows how to get inside peoples' heads, particularly loonies, and describe their thought processes scarily well. Good for a rainy day or when you're sick at home, once you've read all of his others."
2,Too biased for my taste,"Read more as a story about the history of BMW, I found it to be lacking in use as a buying guide for someone unfamiliar with BMW. Considering it is a model by model guide I would have found more data on options and sub-models useful. And there is little doubt that the author is a very biased BMW driver. This is where it really falls down, according to this book each BMW is practically faultless so how do you choose?"
2,You Are Alone,"An amazingly depressing movie. I would rather wind duct tape around my head and pull it off slowly than to watch this movie again. I'm consigning it to recycle. If you like to watch self-absorbed people making agonizing choices in a virtually plotless film, this is the movie for you."
5,This Tape Works!,"I love reviews becuase it is real people talking about their experiences and I find them very helpful. Over the winter I put on a few pounds, especially in the hip and thigh area. I tried everything and got very frustrated. I started this tape and saw great results in only 2 weeks. My jeans started to hang on me and I felt great. It is easy to follow, not boring, and you have no annoying person trying to motivate you. Some of the reviews say Claudia looks awkward in some of the moves. I agree, but believe it is because she is tall, with long legs. I love the location and music. Try this one and I don't think you will be dissappointed."
3,save your money,"While the squats and lunges are good, the floor workout is horrible! Even if you're at an intermediate fitness level, she does endless repetitions (say 100) tiring the leg you're working to exhaustion that you're forced to stop and thus don't get the complete workout. Other workout videos switch legs between sets, but not this one. The cool down does not have a good stretch and why does Claudia stretch her shoulders in the warm up? Claudia looks awkward exercising, she's naturally thin. All the video editing is annoying."
2,Terrible form,"The exercises in this video would be effective if done properly. Although Kathy Kaehler (Schiffer's trainer) demonstrates the proper form, Schiffer doesn't follow through when she's exercising. She seems very awkward and not into the moves at all. This workout may be good for a beginner, but for anyone at an intermediate or advanced level, it wouldn't be worth the purchase."
3,Kind of hard.,"My 5 year old son likes this game, but it took him several tries to get the hang of how to control it. A few parts are very difficult to beat, and the kid needs to be able to read, or have an adult read some parts.Some parts are funny, and it's fun to be able to change your character and mode of transportation (walking, skates, or skateboard) at any time."
5,Nickelodeon Rocket Power Beach Bandits,"It's a great game. Buy it. Unlock Pi,Lars + others Tito says ""Hey Brudda!"" That is funny Conroy says O mon those robots. When Mackenzie sits there and wines crys and complains so get ready for a hard game. It is easy just goto options and goto cheats and answer about 5 Rocket Power questions they are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy to easy. It rocks with a Rocket & some Power."
5,Wildly touching!,"This superb documentary guides you through the life of a beautiful and playful leopardess in Botswana, from small cub to young adult. The story develops around her interaction with other animals ---to acquire the skills needed to survive--- and her adaptation to the environment. Other leopards (including her mother), squirrels, wild pigs, deer, baboons, hyenas, and lions contribute to this film. It contains amazing scenes and shows incredible behaviors that you would never imagine. I felt great empathy for this wild star and enjoyed every bit of the film."
3,Reversal of Fortune; a different type of movie,"Oscar-winning actor Jeremy Irons delivers a great performance. He plays a very cold blooded bizzare man. Glenn close was very good also as the frustrated millionaire wife. The film was very unusual to say the least, but very good. A must see."
2,"Not one likable character, thoroughly unpleasant","Not one likable character, thoroughly unpleasant. . .If you want to know what happened, go to the encyclopedia. The movie is rambling, showing the same unpleasant situations multiple times with multiple interpretations.A big problem is that none of the characters is pleasant. Dershowitz should be, but he is played in such a hamming, cocky way that he is just as unlikable as the rest."
1,Wrong cd in package,"The cd received was not the one ordered. The sleeve was correct, but the cd was different. Considering the price, it was not worth the hassle of sending back."
1,Four Tops 40th Anniversary Special,"If my wife and I had not loaded the player ourselves, we would not have recognized this group as the Four Tops. We assumed after listening to this performance that it wasn't the original group or at least not the original lead vocal. Checking again, we couldn't actually verify if this was the original group or not, however, they are represented as ""The Four Tops"".This performance simply does not represent the golden sound of the original group....Extremely disappointing. If you're into this group, buy some of their older releases on CD and save your money on this DVD."
1,workout video,"Video was broken. However, seller did manage to give refund after a few days. I would probably give this seller a second chance."
5,No Doubt About It..........,"The sad ""Simple Kind of Life"" never sounded so sweet as it does on the acoustic version on this single. Gwen Stefani's breathy singing gives you chills instantly. The slightly dark ""Beauty Contest"" comes through much like a hybrid of what sounds like ""Marry Me"" and some missing lyrics from a possibly early edition of ""Magic's in the Makeup"", with some beautiful and eerie vocalizing. Be sure to listen to the last couple of seconds for a cute little surprise. Trust me it'll bring a smile to your face. All in all, a perfect buy for any No Doubt fan, or even a fan of enhanced cd's (the digital clarity is perfect in the cd-rom music video). Buy this NOW, and you'll have no doubts about it."
4,"Decent, but not a perfect replica.","This poster is printed on thicker paper than I was expecting, that's nice. However, it's a bit blurry and not the same poster that is in Mulder's office in the X-Files. It is similar enough for me, and I like it."
1,Terrible documentary,"This is a terrible documentary, it promises too much and it actually has like 5 minutes of interviews with spiritual leaders and brain scientists and the rest is like watching a bad soap opera."
2,Disappointing,"I loved Hay's earlier novel, A Student of Weather but was extremely disappointed in this offering. The story is character driven, but the main characters aren't particulary interesting or believable. Their (endless) ruminations about films are so banal I kept wondering if the author was deliberately making fun of them. The fact that main character Harriet is supposed to be a writer is also hard to buy into, given her slightly creepy and thoroughly pedestrian missives to her idol, Pauline Kael. The setting is supposedly contemporary, but the characters' sensibilities and interests seem oddly constricted and old fashioned -- as when husband Lew flees the undercurrent of marital tensions by retreating to his room to play his mandolin. If you like to hang out with people who revere Guys and Dolls as one of the greatest films ever made, and consider the question ""Sinatra or Astaire?"" the height of probing film criticism, this book is for you."
1,Why did I bother?,"I bought this book on the advice of a friend and forced myself to read it all. I have never read such a disjointed, uninteresting novel - and I'm a movie buff!!! The maneuvering of the plot in order to bring it around to the movies is contrived and boring. The constant change of point of view is distracting and the characters unbelievable. One of your reviewers compared Garbo Laughs to Margaret Atwood's work and Russo's Empire Falls...PLEASE...get real.Pauline M. Grocki"
1,Where's the rest?,"I completely understand works like Milne's Winnie the Pooh, over which there are reprint rights issues, being omited. There is no reason for classic children's works like Montgomery's Anne (of Green Gable and Avonlea) to be missing from a ""complete"" collection when Penguin publishes them individually elsewhere.And as a sidenote, Frankenstein was never intended as a children's book, but was Shelley's novelization of her ethics and philosophy works."
5,Great injector,"This is a serious injector for shoulders and other large meats. Very durable and well-made. The capacity Is fairly large, too which makes injecting go faster with less re-loading."
3,Injector,The holes in the needle are too far up the needle. Too big for the average back yard BBQer. Well built!
3,Too BIG,"Although I have seen one reviewer said that it was too big but obviously I wanted to try for myself and yeah .....the needle insert is too big and there are like 20 holes on the other needle....This thing is good for BIG piece of meat, like an cow leg or something, something like a 30lb turkey size.....To summarize, this is good for industrial use and not for small stuff"
5,Classic and Simple,This is the perfect tool for injecting flavor into your meats prior to cooking or smoking. Simple to use and easy to clean. A must for making your meats juicy and tasty.
2,wish I hadn't,"This injector has not worked for me at all. I find that it is only really useful for liquid injection and even then, it is difficult to assemble (the parts aren't mechanically perfect) and injecting it into meat such as a chicken breast results in a lot of projectile splatter of the marinade. Hurray, salmonella on the walls and ceiling!I'm giving it two stars (instead of one) because I hold hope that someone with greater skill could make this thing work wonders for them. For me, it's a wasted $20."
1,Bayou injector _Junk!,Should have paid closer attention to other reviews. The top will not stay on-threads are worthless. Terrible quality for a $20 item.
3,Good but not great,"The appliance is of decent (not great) quality and should last a fairly long time. The machining tolerances of the threads could have been tighter and because of this, they are easy to misalign and care must be taken when attaching and removing the needles or the threads will strip. I can see why others have had isues with this. The device arrived oiled, and i was unsure whether it was veggie oil or a light machine oil left over from manufacturing. However, when I washed it prior to first use, metallic residue was present from the machining. Therefore, I recommend a thorough cleaning prior to use. Also, there were metal shavings where the needle was cut that I had to remove during cleaning. I do like the multidirectional openings on the needle; they are a big advantage over a traditional needle. I would purchase the item again for this reason. However, lower than expected manufacturing quality resulted in a lower rating."
5,Well made product!,"Best part of this injector is that it comes with two types of needle, one with many holes and one standard end of tip hole. Also like the silicone ""o-ring"" design inside on the plunger."
5,Great for Marinading Brisket,This weekend I smoked a 12lb brisket and I used this injector for the marinade. I have to say it is a great injector very sturdy and not flimsy at all. Watch out with the needle with multiple holes it will spray at you when you are taking it out. I loved it! Cant wait to you use it in a turkey!
5,Great toy for toddlers,I bought several of the Giggle & Go vehicle packs as Christmas presents for my Elmo-loving toddler.These cars are adorable. Chunky and sturdy for little hands to push. The wheels move without any problems. The cars are colorful and eye catching. The cars seem durable and will withstand long-term toddler play.The cars are compatible with the Little People garage that we have as well making this a great versatile toy.I would have loved to have been able to buy one large set with all the vehicles instead of duplicating the Elmo car just to get the other characters.Great toy though. I would recommend these.
3,Not half bad,"These things aren't half bad. They work better than the ones with the foam in them. However, mine seem to break very easily. I myself take very good care of the mat, it's my sister and her friends, on the other hand, that tend to break them.I would get it for kids, but for teens and adults, try to find something else."
3,Smells toxic,This mat has a very toxic odor. We tried to air it out for days and days and the odor is still very strong. I have had a headache after standing on this mat. Do not purchase this brand if you are sensitive to odors. The mat that came with the Playstation Game manufactured by Konami works and smells fine.
3,Durability a problem,"For a beginner like I am, I thought this would be a good way to try out the the DDR games without investing too much money if I didn't like it. So in that sense, it did exactly what I bought it for, but it turns out I really enjoy DDR and its construction just didn't hold up. One month and the sensors are shifting so it isn't accurate anymore and causes me to miss on timing. Still for ten dollars, if you don't want to chance spending a bunch of money on something you aren't sure you'll enjoy, or you only play occasionally it's a good place to start."
5,Happy Mom,"Item was just as expected, shipping was delayed however it still arrived in the time stated! Kids love it! Thanks"
1,Terrible.. Terrible... Terrible....,This switch is garbage... (as is all linksys switches). We own this and many 5 and 8 port switches. Every single on when the power goes out must be manually powered off and powered back on. Linksys's terrible technical support says it is normal.... How is that normal? DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE... YOU WILL BE SORRY!
3,Creative for sure,"The songs I love and listen to over and over again are as follows:JP Rooster (fun song and it reminds me of Bessie Smith's (Nobody Knows You When You Are Down)Mutron Angel (superb vocalist and background singing and meaningful lyrics)The Greatest Show (just a fun song)Morris BrownI absolutely love these songs.Honorable mentions:Call the LawJazzy and Bluey Instrumentals with the horns (maybe did not care for lyrics)In saying that, I think there were 5 or 6 songs that I really liked. I was really turned off by songs with profanity and racial epitahs. Overall I thought it was a very creative cd. How many artist do we know of that have even 2 or 3 good songs?I think my money was well spent, and I don't even like rap."
2,Not latest edition,"The book I purchased is not the current version. It's full of errors, which have been corrected in the current edition. As soon as I received it, I immediately made notes in it and it is not resalable condition.Good prodeuct, but outdated."
4,"""No brain...No pain""",True this sequel is not as superior as the original...But it was still pretty good overall...It had some creepy moments...
4,INTERESTING MOVIE,"I AM A FAN OF SORTS, FOR THE GRUESOME (NOT GORY), AND FOUND THIS DVD AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL."
1,Not for children and certainly not for those with conscience,"Basically, the same exact thing. Only without the road. Boy's mother actress dies in an accident on the set and his friend's dog is murdered by his father. And the two seem to think they'll do better in a pet cemetary. Just as bad as the first with the same degrading garbage that isn't worth lowering yourself by watching. If you liked BEETHOVEN, you won't like this."
1,Ick.,"This sequel is a disgusting splatterfest with the bare bones of a story wrapped around it. Anthony Edwards (who should have known better) and Edward Furlong (who shouldn't have, probably) star as a father and son who move to the town which the Creed family from the first movie didn't have so much luck in. Mayhem ensues. A zombified sheriff oozing face goo onto his cute little screaming wife as he sexually assaults her... A box full of chewed-up kittens... A young boy getting his neck snapped in a scene which winds up being played for laughs... These scenes are not just disgusting, they are in bad taste.The first movie was not ""Silence of the Lambs""-caliber cinema either, but at least it was scary and a decent ""popcorn"" movie. It was gross too, but it was practically ""Annie"" compared to this sequel's pointless, offensive gore-a-thon. Apparently the filmmaker's goal was to make as many audience members as possible flee the theater retching. Mission accomplished. Shame on you, Dr. Greene!"
4,Fantastic!,"I think it's great! If you're having a boring evening, just run down to the video-store and get this film. It's better sounds and graphic quality than the original. But the original is scarier."
2,"Not good, but has its moments","Sequels to films based upon Stephen King stories are usually rather awful. The ""Children of the Corn"" formula was beaten into the ground fairly early, and the sequel to ""Carrie"" was an absolute dog. This one, although it is a clunky, poorly-written hack job, is nonetheless entertaining in places. It it worth viewing just for Clancy Brown's outrageously funny portrayal of Gus. Other than that, it's nothing special. Edward Furlong somehow manages to look and act creepier than the villains, but watch it anyway. Gus is a gas!"
3,An interesting take on advertising,Ralph Nader's intro was good. The book assumes that advertising and marketing are all bad. It's up for you to decide.
2,"Good HRM, if you get a working one.","My first order arrived DOA (dead battery I think).Amazon sent out a replacement, which died (again, battery, I think) during my first workout. Amazon then refused to send out a replacement for the replacement---issuing me a refund. I'm not happy about this, because, in the meantime, Amazon's price has tripled.Based on my reading of the manual, and very limited use, this is a great HRT for us beancounters of our workouts; it keeps track of a lot of information (no PC download, though).Amazon needs to get a batch with good batteries (which are not user-replaceable, BTW)."
1,Not user friendly at all,"I purchased this product since it looked like it had good capabilities for a very attractive price. After reading the manual and trying to set it up for 20 minutes, I gave up in frustration. I'm returning it and looking for a Polar, which has many user recommendations."
3,Portable Heart Rate Monitor w/o Cheststrap,"Good product, comfortable to wear, however the enclosed instructions are very poorly written and difficult to follow."
4,Not even a woman,"I'm not even a woman and I don't know what the hell I'm going to do with this. (Hence four, not five stars.) But I had to buy it. HOW ELSE can you possibly save an incredible $500,000?!? I am the World's smartest, most savvy shopper. I am probably going to feel good about myself every time I get it out of the safe and look at it."
4,White Gold hater no more,"I've never been a huge fan of ""white gold"" ... for the same reasons white chocolate doesn't get me excited. They're both posers. This watch changed my perception of white gold. I still think white chocolate is lousy, but you can't please everyone."
3,horozum,"its ok, i like my swatch better, the diamonds are too small, i prefer min 2 carat diamonds, the chinese make better watches, it gets dirty when i work on my truck"
5,Phenomenal edition -- can't wait for Season 2!,There have been some really great reviews and I don't have much to add that they haven't already written. I am thoroughly enjoying this edition of ST:TOS Season 1 and I really like the new/updated audio track and the updated graphics. I also like how with the press of a button I can toggle back and forth between the 'original' and 'updated' versions -- mid-show!
5,Great memories!,"It has been quite sometime since I have watched the original series. It reminded me of what I liked about Star Trek. Watch, remember and enjoy."
5,Great Set,"""Rating this set less than 5 stars because you think Paramount is ripping you off is silly. Who didn't know that they would release the season sets?""Back in 1999 the norm was to release shows in individual volumes. It was Fox and the X-Files which changed the way we think. But when Trek started on DVD, this was the only way (Twilight Zone and I Spy also came out individually at this time). Anyone who bought the DVDs as they initially came out thought this was normal. Anyone who says different is lying to sound smart.Trust me, if I knew box sets were coming, I never would have bought the 40 volumes. But, I did, I loved them and they did tide me over until today. I am buying the box sets and either selling my old or donating them.Great show, baby. 1966 is back!"
1,Cant watch,I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion. This is the first of two downloads that didn't play. I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok.
4,Greg,"I am 57 and so grew up with Star Trek TOS on TV. I found this new Blu-ray set to be fantastic. However, there are some technical issues. The toggle between the enhanced and the original did not work well on my system. And the audio was a bit spotty from episode to episode. But all in all I am really happy I bought this and hope they continue to release all of the seasons of the original series. Just saw the new movie today and having this DVD makes it all the better."
4,Beautifully remastered,"Very happy with this purchase. The episodes are remastered and the colors just pop. The added special effects are seamlessly added. Only downside is the packaging, which is a bit frustrating and resulted in many of the title inserts to constantly fall out. Also, the discs are double-sided so they do have to be handled more carefully than regular dvds. But the show itself is brilliant and as cutting edge as ever."
1,You've got to be kidding?,"One of the things that is the big difference between HD and Blu Ray right now is the price of the movies. Blu Ray movies are 50% more than normal DVDs while HD is usually around 25% more. I think this is the only thing that's keeping the race going.The Star trek sereies is great, no doubt, but to charge this much is absurd. They are alienating those who might be on the hi-def fence by showing them that it's not only a hefty investment in the machines, but that they are going to get taken to the cleaners on the DVDs.Ouch, this is just a slap in the face to not only Star Trek fans (like myself) but a great way to convince people NOT to go Hi Def.These need to be $79 a season for me to even consider them. I got the original DVDs for $40 a season and love them, and would love to have the new Hi-Def versions... but not at thier asking price. Pretty sad."
1,Enough of the DUMB ANIMATED MENUS !,"I certainly hope paramount doesnt screw up THE BRADY BUNCH set when it comes out in March!!Of course i have nothing to say about the series itself! But, the over animated menu design is a pain in the neck along with the navigation. (just a personal opinion)Along with that, WHY DOESNT THE LOSER WHO AUTHORS THESE DVDS IN MANUFACTURING simply make a ""Play All"" button on the menu!!???Its a pain if you intend to watch the whole disc and have to run for the dvd player every second to initiate a new episode.How hard can it be?????????????????????????"
3,star trek another sci-fi adventure,"star trek, as a kid i never like it or watched it as my parents did. now im grown up and like it. so im watching it for the first time. i got the first season off e-bay (sealed) brand new. disc two skipped. i looked at the back of the disc. 2 scratches. effected play. but i guess not deep enough. it plays on my computer. but not the one hooked up to tv. so i checked all disc. no scratches on them. who ever packed them was'nt carefull in putting them in the case. for that kind of money they should. so i would advise people to check disc."
3,boldly taking your money,"Priced at about double what it should be, and lacking the pilot. Nice extras, but not worth the extra bucks. Good to see all the shows in one package, but lets get the price down!"
5,Damm i want this,they had to make it hd-dvd.i can see that blu-ray is where things is going.i want this so bad.ill have to wait till it comes out on blu-ray.after seeing and hearing whats been done i cant wait.i got the big burr for this...lol
1,cant download to second pc with 1.5 G cable,"dont work. only a short 3.51 min was downloaded. want to transfer from one pc to another for viewing but cant download on second pc. ""says you hav eno more PC`s you can download this too."" dont get it."
2,The Price Is To High,"I love Star Trek but the price for this seems to be $20.00 to high. It would be nice to know what is going to be in the set so we can understaStar Trek: Original Series - Season 1 [Blu-ray]nd the price. Maybe there is a lot of extras that would make the price reasonable. Please give us some details to help with our purchase decision, thank you."
3,Love the Series; hate the packaging.,"I have to say that the packaging of this series is absolutely the worse I have ever seen in a series, or nearly so. The distributor should be ashamed of this. Loyal fans deserve better than a clamshell case that falls apart in their hands. And take care that the tape holding the individual jewel cases together doesn't break. What a bunch of crapNote for Greg: The color of the boxes has nothing to do with the color of the titles. It has everything to do with the color of the tunics worn by the crew: Gold Tunics for Command staff, Blue Tunics for Sciences, and Red Tunics for Engineering and security crew."
2,Not worth that much money,"I took in all the hype and was really waiting to get my copy..... I wish I'd spent my money on something else. The HD redone effects seemed way to short to short for me. Not there long enough to take it in. And there are still alot of ""record pops"" in the video, not to much , but for this much money I expected better. And I do not know about seasons 2 and 3 , but the colors seemed out of wack or something. Sortof like a music song which has been processed too much. If it were cheaper , I would not have any issues, but for this much money, I do. I give it two stars instead of one because I appeciated the attempt. Please for the sake of everybody ... LOWER THE PRICE!!!!"
3,Slightly Disappointed,"Star Trek: The Original Series - Season 1 [Blu-ray]I recently purchased the first season of Star Trek on Blue ray. I was impressed by some of the enhancements, ship motion is more seamless and other graphical changes. I must say that I am disappointed by the fact that the episodes are not in order. I grew up in the 60's, and my family sat watching each week as the latest episode was released. So when I sat down with my son to watch them for his first time, there was just something missing.I will say in the defense of the product, that they include stardates in the menus so that you can try to arrange them in some order. So far I have not found the first episode ""The Cage"" with Captain Pike, and I really wanted to start with that episode. I am hoping that it is buried somewhere in the multi-disc set, and not simply omitted.Overall, I will say that at the discounted price, the set was worthwhile, but as stated before, I am a bit disappointed."
5,He Loved It!!!!,"I was not sure about getting this for my daughter to give to her Dad for Father's Day because I have never ordered anything like this online before.I was not sure if it would be in good shape or not, and if it would even work!I was very pleased, and so were they! It works and it was in great shape!!!It was like buying it from a store!Thank you!!!"
1,Boy Am I Glad I Waited...But Stinks For Those That Didn't,I am glad I was smart enough not to throw away my money like the people that paid $20.00 for only two episodes on prior DVDs.But I have to say I sure feel sorry for those people. So sorry that I will be laughing all the way to the bank with the money I saved for waiting!Seriously...this situation is TERRIBLE for the Star Trek fans that got ripped off. We feel your pain.
3,"Paramount, please restore prints","I remember in the early 70's through about the early 90's, Star Trek reruns ran in syndication as horribly muddy-colored prints. Then, all of a sudden, we started seeing these beautiful shining pristine prints, like they were filmed yesterday. I'll never forget the stunning contrast when this ""switch over "" occurred. All I can say is what happened to those beautiful prints? They're not on the Star Trek DVDs. Did -they- get faded already? Digital technology alone does not make a great DVD. Lets spend some money on print quality Paramount!"
3,classic sci-fi tv though at a higher price,"When I got aeound to picking up Star Trek the original serries vol.1 I had a bit of sticker shock. Amazon was by far the best price for a new copy, but even then for the material it is a bit pricey. Nice looking video quality and a fancy storage box aside, I will have to think hard about spending any more money for the rest. I guess the question to ask yourself is ""How much do I love Star Trek vs the cost?"" 3 not 4 stars because of price."
3,Great-but I'm not buying,"This version has great 5.1 sound, menus, and features. The deal breaker for me is that the episodes are not in order (stardate). They are arranged by original air date. This puts the second pilot behind several other episodes and jumbles up the first half of the season. I have had the series on vhs for a decade. I guess I'll be happy with that. One last thing, as of now (10/3/04) Amazon has the best price by $20 or $30 bucks of any where I have seen."
3,Funky,"Funny how far we have come electronically. Watching this old series with its outdated ""futuristic"" electronics is amusing. But it was entertaining!"
3,Not bad,"The picture is good the sound though out the speakers leaves something to be desired. I used it to play my xbox, as well as being my computer montitor and after 11 months the speakers blew, luckly I was just barely under the warranty yet but it's taking forever to get it fixed."
2,Another opinion,"I absolutely love Deva Premal's voice and CDs. This was a huge disappointment for me. I don't like almost everything on this CD. There's nothing remarkable about Miten's voice, even though it's certainly nice to listen to. His lyrics are banal. Sweet and heartfelt, but hackneyed.There's nothing really bad about the music, but most of it is Miten by himself (the ones with Deva are far better, to my ear), and I honestly can't find anything to recommend it.I only gave it two stars for the few songs that are predominantly Deva's voice.As much as I am dissing this CD I wouldn't hesitate to recommend ""Love is Space."" So, if you're expecting something along those lines, don't get this as it's totally different."
2,GT IS TERRIBLE BUY the SHONEN JUMP MANGA!!!,I loved the Graphic Novels of Dragon ball and Z but they edited it on cartoon network all the content adults call *bad*!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,...,"Its cute in ways but really now? It can be appealing but he IS a total loser(sorry but it's true) and he doesn't think of the future. All he cares about is this date...and nothing can come of it... It happens once, and then its over. The movie was so dragged out. I did like the aspect of one guy going for his dreams but this was a little too extreme... He also was unemployed and putting off a job for the sake of his date..... Also he was picky about the job that he was offered... ""a low paying job"", he said. Hello idiot you don't have any money you need a job just take it. I know I'm a very harsh critic so I'll look at how it was good for the sake of those who loved it.It was cute and a different kind of movie. Also the movie had its funny parts. It had ways of being real life and personal...but thats it..."
4,So it is bogus...,"Give the guy a break. If not for the entertainment, then for his ingenuity. It's actually a cute, heart-warming movie. For a star-unstruck person like me, Drew was very likeable in this movie. She came across as down-to-earth and natural. I'm sure Circuit City did not mind their policy being ""abused"" with all the free promotion they got. For all I know, they might be on it also. Call me naive, but I prefer to believe the best of people's intentions. Best of luck to Brian."
1,Good book to read if you are a self centered bridezilla,that only cares to fit into a size 4 dress. This book was annoying to read and had very little humor. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.
3,Okay but not great,"Pretty good, if not great, modern (1999) surf music. A bit formulaic and not overly original, but it sounds good. Can't hold a candle to a band like Los Straightjackets, for example."
1,this game sucks,This game is so bad. the graphics are not the best the controls are slugish. The characters look blury they don't even look real
5,Indian Thought,"The Author has aimed at eliciting the relationship between Existentialist ideas and some aspects of Indian thought. In the first two chapters, which briefly review modern Existentialism and it's background, the analogies and correspondences have been just indicated by Sanskrit terms juxtaposed in brackets.Their fuller implications have been examined in the third and last chapter: with what success, it is for the reader to judge. It is hoped that the transliteration of Sanskrit is sufficiently clear for ordinary purposes, although it may not satisfy the demands of meticulous scholarship."
4,"Good stuff, great message","I never heard of Charlie Louvin until hearing a piece on him on NPR radio. Once I got this CD I couldn't help but tap my feet and sing along. ""Atomic Power"" was stuck in my head for a week.It's sort of like listening to your old grandfather singing at a family picnic. Not your typical country singer. He sounds aged but fun. His backup singer(s) are more than complemetary. I was surprised at how much I liked this CD. I am usually not a huge fan of country music, but Louvin is contageous and inspirational"
5,It's not a LOSER!,"This movie should be a regular holiday classic right along side ""It's a Wonderful Life"". I love the colorful language and if you see it on normal TV, you're not getting the true movie.This movie is so good, like others have said, it's got a little bit of everything. If you have an ounce of italian blood in you and grew up anywhere in the Northeast and you have not seen this movie, you're missing out. What upsets me is that you can't find it to rent in most Blockbusters/video stores anymore and it's very hard to find on VHS for purchase. Hopefully they will make this in DVD format someday soon. If you get the chance to see it, you won't be disappointed."
3,pretty Good should have been better,this film had some moments.Danny Aiello did a Good job as did Anthony Lapaglia.but this film is a bit too Cliched for it's own Good overall to me.it starts fairly straight&then it goes all over the place.it's a film worth watching but not a film that breaks any new territory.
3,Something missing,"The second concerto is good.The first concerto is too reserved. As usual, Bernstein delivered a certain level of power and dynamics. Zimerman, on the other hand, was way too reserved in terms of colors of tone and, particularly, power. My 10-year old son and I found the Rubinstein version (also on DVD) is more satisfactory.BTW, Zimerman's recital DVD was wonderful; go get that one."
3,Madden 2003,"First of all, this is not the BEST VIDEO GAME EVER. It's in the top five, yes, but not the best.What is up with the music? Do we really need to know who signs the songs? I don't think so. Does the music needs to be that loud during the game?Where is that cool introduction video we had on Madden 2002? Now, all you see it's a football player saying ""Madden 2003, it's in the game"", what the hell is that?I don't know what happened this time. I mean, the game is good, it's even better than Madden 2002, but they said it was going to be jaw dropping and it is not."
1,[It's Bad,"This game is almost no different from it older brother, Madden 2002. THe older one sucked too. You couldnt press a button at the same time as your opponent or it wont pick up the signal. I shall say it again. It sucks. In addition, it Blows very large noses, as well as sneezes. I highly warn you not to even look at it, let alone buy or rent it. You will be dissappointed guaranteed. Every time you hear its name called, run to the nearest church and pray to God you havent been cursed. If there isnt a nearest church, or the nearest church isnt very near at all. Simply say or shall I say scream, NO! Kind of like the whole say no to drugs thing without the entire idea of running to the nearest church. I ONCE AGAIN WARN YOU NOT TO EVEN LOOK AT THIS GAME. TURN AWAY AND RUN."
5,WOW - looks just like Monday Night Football!,"I haven't played, but my hubby gives this the HIGHEST reviews. He can't turn it off! I have to say, between the graphics, the commentary, and the music, for me it is a whole lot like watching an actual game! Only these guys actually go to replay when they should, unlike the real game when they carry on and on about something totally irrelevant. Plus, when we play it, the Lions actually have a shot at winning. This is a really neat game!Buy it for the NFL fan in your family - you won't regret it! Have fun!"
3,"Good game, Bad game","This game is not bad because of the good franchise mode and other new options available. the worst part of this game is by far the gameplay. The a.i. is so bad in this game it's no even funny, they only make the impossible interceptions not the routine ones, the fumbles are so stupid because u have like 3 a game, the d-backs will make stupid plays like not batting the ball away when they can just staying down and waiting for the wr's to make the catch. The play books are also still TOO SMALL. i give this a 3 because it's got good game modes but HORRIBLE gameplay."
1,MAJOR DISSAPOINTMENT,"Madden 2002 was probably the greatest sports title of all time. Needless to say there were a lot of expectations for Madden 2003. Play-action passing is improved. Trick plays have been added to the playbook. The game is loaded with new extras, such as online play, training camp, preseason, etc. Where the game fails is the actual gameplay. The normal Madden buttons are the same, but the Offense is almost impossible to stop. Where in the last Madden punts were a norm and a defensive battle took place often, 2003 is all about the scoring. It is extremely easy to put up over 70 points a piece in head to head competition. The offense is easy to run. It is no longer difficult to pass for over 70 percent completion rate with almost any QB in the game. The game has me looking to rent NFL2k3 to see if it can top this dissapointment."
2,Nfl 2k3 shall blow this game out of the water.,To start of let's talk about the graphics.This game has terrible graphics.You wouldn't even recognize a player if they told you his name.The gameplay is bad.The rookie draft was ok.The only thing I really liked about the game was it's soundtrack.I just didn't have fun playing this game.
4,MADDENHEAVEN,"I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME. THE GRAPHICS ARE GREAT, AND THE PLAYER ANIMATIONS ARE FANTASTIC. THE ONLY GRIPE I HAVE IS THAT PLAYBOOKS ARE LIMITED. I HOPE THAT THEY CHANGE THAT IN THE FUTURE."
2,Awkward,"Wasn't planning on learning how to make arrows, but there you go. The book feels like it's put together or spliced out of sync. The author is obviously an expert at his craft but is one place beyond the decimal for this beginner. This may make more sense to me after a season or two of shooting. However, right now after finishing this book I just feel dumber, cheap and light years behind an unreachable curve. I'm going to shoot anyway."
1,Sickening mindless violence,"I strongly regret I watched this movie. It is so emotionally disturbing! It contains multiple scenes of unbelievably brutal murders, usually followed by arsons. Do not expose yourself to these images -- they are totally sickening."
1,"How do you spell this, ahem, FILM??","Three words: SLICK-IDIOT-PLOT.Sad to think that this is what Hollywood has sunk so much money into: a stupid story with half-baked characters, lousy go-thought-the-motions acting and the above stated three-word phrase. Plus, it's TOO DAMN LONG!At best, this is a good film for testing your 5.1 system. But then again, that's what most empty-headed Hollywood films are about these days."
3,Not awful but not great.,"First off let me say i surely didn't hate this movie but it mad me mad the fact that Denero had to die. Of course seing the film he becomes the center of the whole movie but if the Writer/Director who i must say did a great job on ""2 days in the valley"" should have at least let him be in more of it. I thought from seeing the trailers that Denero and Burns would be the 2 bringing the criminals down but i had no idea that he was going to die. Or at least not that early into the film. I thought the movie was real good up to that point but in a way i almost stoped caring. I would recomend this for a rental especially on dvd because New Line does does good dvds. So if you can get an idea of what your going to see and you think you might like it. You most likely will."
2,boring,"The storyline- two foreigners enter the country and Robert De Niro's cop character has to bring them down. It's as boring as it sounds. The writing is really generic and typical as well. It's boring just thinking about it. I refuse to recommend this film to anyone.I'm not trying to be a jerk by being really short here, it's just that I've seen so many predictable films in the same exact style as this one, and it's just a repetitive nightmare watching these kind of movies these days. I've honestly had enough.But hey, maybe 15 Minutes is for you, if you're someone who likes frequent ""cop chases bad guy because bad guy remains smart and free for the majority of the film"" scenes. There's many scenes like these throughout this film for you to enjoy then. Me? It's been done a thousand times by this point, and I'm just really tired of the formula."
3,"Good storyline, but weak tension setting...","I was surprised by this movie. It is the first Robert DeNiro movie that I did not really enjoy. I thought the ""reporter"" character was overacted, and I've never enjoyed this actor's work, including the long running Cheers show, and the spinoff show in Seattle.SPOILERS ALERT:Robert DeNiro dying half way through, was quite a shock. I actually bought it, to enjoy Robert DeNiro's acting.I thought it was over-violent for the storyline. I know that seems strange, being a DeNiro film. But, I thought it was overkill. I thought the actions towards the females were blantantly overkill as well.I would not recommend this film to anyone wishing to enjoy a Robert DeNiro movie as I was. I would say that it is ""interesting"" at the most.Not recommended.MC White said: Not recommended."
3,15 minutes,"I bought this cd based on other people reviews. It's good, don't get my wrong, but come one: 7 songs, only one is longer 2 minutes, $10. That's almost one dollar a minute. I feel kinda ripped off here and it makes it hard to appreciate this way too short album (I don't see ""EP"" anywhere). Then people complain about kids downloading songs illegally..."
2,Size Report,"Great Delivery. I probably did not research enough and it resulted in a bad choice. The box is entirely to small however, I'll adapt."
4,too expensive for its age,"i have bought many movies and have many of the old ones, so i have a pretty good idea of what i expect to pay. and new ones starting out at over twenty bucks is too much for this movie"
1,traded how long ago??? and still whining...,"you forgot 2004.4-0.see ya ruth. don't let the door kick you in the *ss on the way out.signed,the boston red sox"
5,Timeless poems from a very contemporary poet.,I looked for this book at a book store today and could not believe that it is out of print. I read this book at least 25 years ago and find it as poignant and profound today as I did then. Diane Wakoski is truly gifted and I think every woman who has loved and lost or loved and felt betrayed must read these poems. You won't be able to forget some of them and you won't feel as though you're the only one who loved someone too much and did not receive their love in return. Put this book back in print!
2,The manual that came with the calculator is better,"I bought this book to help me use the calculator for school. I hoped it would provide straight forward instructions on how to do basic tasks such as finding the zero's on a graph or maybe the vertex. The answer is probably in there somewhere but it is not in plain site. This book may be useful for dummies who have the time to plow through it in its entirety to learn how to use the calculator, but it is not organized to show you how to do basic things quickly."
3,"Well, ya, it's ""educational""!","Okay, so it's not really educational, however, my older kids, who are big SNL fans, have gotten a good sense of the older shows from the game. We've had a blast playing this together.The little game pieces are SNL characters, however, they are mostly recent (Land Shark and Conehead are the only older ones.) The pieces are CUTE though! Really funny.One disappointing thing is that while the DVD plays a portion of a skit, it doesn't play the whole skit. Surely, in a DVD (part of a $40 game!), they could have included entire skits.I like the questions in general, and found the game challenging, but not overwhelmingly challenging. I think it's great for the average SNL fan."
4,A wonderful game!!,I bought this game for my 3 year old for Christmas and he loves it. He did really well until the final levels to get to Clockwerk and then he needed mommy to step in a help him out some. We still haven't finished the master thief sprints but we have finished the rest of the game. It was a blast and worth every penny
3,good but got old,"this game was very fun and adective, but after u play it until like the third or something like that level u get really bored, i haven't touched it since, all in all not worth it's price"
2,too much,"most importantly this strap will not ""float"" any camera with a substantial lens attached. In hot weather it is just too hot to even hang on your neck,and it takes up way too much room in any camera case. Apart from these criticisms it looks great!"
4,This book is an excellent aid in understanding the Biz.,"All You need to know about the music business has been a tremendous help to me in learning about the basic workings of the music business. Subjects range from publishing to royalty calculations and from finding good management to merchandising.It is clearly focused on the US legal and structural situation, though, and should not be used by Europeans as a ""manual"" without checking the facts. For example, publishing works slightly different in Europe and so do royalty calculations.If you want to understand the basic principles of the business, however, it is an absolute must!!"
2,Not for producers,"I guess this would be a good book for singers and musicians, but it was no help to me as a producer. Nothing applied to a producer."
5,A Must Read Book! - Ty Cohen Author of www.Important-Music-Industry-Contacts.com,"Talk About Over Delivering!In ""All You Need to Know About the Music Business"", author DonalD Passman covers every possible angle one would need. NO matter if you are an entry level beginner or a highly paid executive expert, I suggest you read this book from cover to cover, you will learn something new.Ty Cohen Author of www.Important-Music-Industry-Contacts.com(The Industry Yellow Pages)"
4,it had an very informative out look on the music industy,if i wanted to stat a music lable i would definetly get this boo
5,This book should be required reading,"for anyone who is interested in being part of the music business. Every teacher at UCLA in the Music Business program recommends this book for their class, and I can see why. Even though I am now in the business itself, I STILL go back and re-read sections because of the great info in here."
3,Good book but not all you need to know...,"This book it a good book but it leave a lot of valuable info out. I belive that the Steps to Stardom Volume 1 DVD is far better because it actually takes you behind the doors of the music industry to gain priceless information from CURRENT industry CEO's, A&R's, Producer's, Distributor, Celebrities, Engineers, and many more. Once again this is a good book, can be better."
3,"Well sorry P.V. Spade, I like it!","P.V. Spade reviewed this translation back in the late seventies after its was first published and validates the two introductory essays as some of the best work he has read on the subject. Coming from his expertise this is big praise. However he denotes that Loux's intention for a readable translation leaves many technical errors and translational fudges in the work itself. My advice is to place these interdisperced errors in the back of your mind as you study the work. If you have read the secondary liturature on Ockham's logic this translation will be invaluable, especially if hacking through the original latin isn't a possibility. Some of the most modern scholarship concerning this text can be found in the Cambridge Companion to Ockham, epecially the first 5 chapters. A refresher on Aristotle's Categories will also establish precedent."
4,Great for Bon Jovi fans,The CD is great. The only drawback is that they play their old songs (ie Living on a Prayer) when they were older. I was expecting them to sound the same as when they were younger. It's still good but not like the good ol days. It's worth buying if your a fan.
3,"Not good, not bad","I have been a fun of Bon Jovi since 1986. One wild night is their first live album with so many hits I was expecting a better selection of songs what happend with Livin in Sin, Always, Bed of Roses, I'll be there for you, Blaze of Glory, etc.Buy crossroad instead of this if you want a compilation of Bon Jovi's hits."
1,not good at all,this live cd is not good . each song is from a different show it makes the cd sound bad. also the songs sounds bad. what you need to to is go on ebay and get a lootleg cd like i did. please stay away from this one.
1,AIN'T AS GOOD AS THE HEAVY PETTIN LIVE SHOW,I was disapointed with this CD. After ripping off the rock band Heavy Pettin with their song In An Out Of Love it's about as much as I expected. Bring back Pettin any day.
3,BON JOVI COMPILATIONS,Bon Jovi : 'One wild night'I don't normally like live cd's but this has a great collection of songs performed live which makes it a very good compilation.It also includes a studio track 'One wild night 2001' version 2.I still however prefer Bon Jovi: 'Tokyo road' which came at the same time and is the 2nd greatest hits album after Cross road.However copies of 'Tokyo Road the best of Bon Jovi' are very hard to get.
2,Not my favorite,"I really thought this was going to be red. The picture shows that it is red and there is no type to say it isn't. However, it is clear glass--I guess the picture assumes that you will fill it with food coloring. The flowers aren't red either, more of a pinkish color. And it is very heavy--seems like it would fall and break very easily."
3,Doesn't live up to it's billing......Yet,The game has received rave reviews and I bought it based on experience with Baldur's Gate I and and II. THe game is much to linear with the built in storyline. Not nearly as challenging as the prior games. A major problem is that it follows the newest Ad&D rules and they are just a little to wierd for someone who started with the first edition and only grudgingly moved to the 2nd ed. I quickly lost interest in the built in scenario and have not gone back to try out any custom games.This game runs fine on a G4 400mHz with 896MB RAM and 64MB ATI video card.
1,Do Not Bother - Worse Than Terrible,"Do yourself a favor - play Diablo 2 instead of wasting your money on this absolutely worthless, frustrating, terrible game. Yes, it may be 3D, but the character control is show-stopper terrible - unplayable - especially in combat.Also, regardless of how many people are playing together, there is only ONE main prize-weapon. This has two game-ruining effects - first, only ONE player in the team gets rewarded FOR THE ENTIRE QUEST!!!! Second, because everyone knows this, at the End-Main-Battle, no one is trying to defeat the boss, but rather are all fighting each other for the main prize weapon.Stupid story, blah 3D graphics, show-stopping game quirks, horrible interface. Gaming does not get any worse than this - avoid at all costs!!!"
2,more negatives than positives,"Positives: The foam padding was great. My daughter looked very snug in it. Received great reviews from consumer reports.Negatives: So hard to tighten and loosen the straps. Seemed like a great idea with the turning of the knobs, but my hands were red and sore after 10 minutes of trying. Also, about the straps...they are spaced far apart where they go over the shoulders and could easily slip off a small child. The seat is larger than most and the knobs stick out on the sides. Probably won't be able to fit 3 people/car seats in the back seat of a smaller car or SUV.I returned it immediately and purchased a Britax roundabout, which I love."
3,"Nice Scent, Doesn't Last","Based on the other review, I was very excited to try this product despite the cost. (Our diaper champ has been in use for two years now and we have to light candles to mask the odor of some diapers.) The spray has a pleasant odor, but it's power just doesn't last - and you have to use quite a lot of sprays on the offending diaper."
2,kinda dissapointed,"There was only one good thing about this album and that is number 15! Every song sounded exactly alike.You really can't tell the difference between each one of them. Especially the music and the beats, they are all the same!"
5,One for your personal library!,"This book serves on several levels, as a primer showing how to do the stitches, as a pattern and stitch encyclopedia, and it provides sample projects for you to try your hand at your newfound skills. With this in your library you should be able to confidently approach most crochet patterns secure in the knowledge that if the instructions are less than perfect, this encyclopedia will fill in the gaps more than adequately! I would recommend the hard back version as you should get a lot of use from this volume!"
5,Everyone Who Crochets Needs This Book!,"Last holiday season, my family could not find the crochet book I had requested. ""Donna Kooler's Encyclopedia of Crochet"" was substituted, My disappointment over the book not being the title I asked for was brief for, as soon as I opened the book, I was thrilled! I have been crocheting for 40 years and already had several ""How To"" books in my extensive crochet book collection, but this Encyclopedia is different. One, it is presented in a very clear format. I love that the instructions are for both right and left handed as I am helping a left handed woman learn to crochet (I am right handed). The history section was a treat to read and the patterns offered are tasteful and functional. I have not made anything from the book, but will one day. The version I have is paperbound. I like this book so much and refer to it so often that I wish I had a hard-bound version."
5,Excellent!!,I am a beginner and I love this book it has help me so much. The instructions are very clear. Buy the book and you will be crocheting in no time!!!!
3,My first Coben,"Coben had been recommended by a friend and this is my first one to read. Will definitely NOT be my last. Fast-moving and full of humor! Myron is self-deprecating in a quick comeback sort of way that pulls him up from the tough-guy-cop level that many detective novels display. Win, the dog-loyal companion, is a great character & also adds depth."
4,if you've read one Myron Bolitar novel you've read them all,"I have read most Harlan Coben novels but I've finally gotten around to reading 'Deal Breaker', the first of the Myron Bolitar series. Oddly, it gave me a sense of deja vu ... did I read this book before? Myron Bolitar tries to uncover the mystery surrounding the mysterious disappearance of his girlfriend's sister and the death of his father. Of course we are entertained with often humorous dialogue and intriguing characters. And unusual for a Harlan Coben novel, the ending ties together fairly cleanly (that is, no bizarre plot twists at the end). But overall I felt this was only a mildly diverting read, nothing special.Bottom line: a fine light read. But you will forget all about it once you're done."
4,Myron and Win: A Winning Combination,"Harlan Coben's first novel featuring sports agent Myron Bolitar is Deal Breaker. This is one of the finest debut mysteries I have ever read. Sheer enjoyment with an excellent mystery. Bad guys that you love to hate, and wise cracking good guys that you love to love. Myron's sidekick is the refined Win, who likes nothing better than applying pain to ne'er do wells. I found myself laughing out loud on numerous occasions during the brisk reading of this book. This book goes down easy and has a mystery that is not easy to crack. Great fun and highly recommended. Coben is a heck of a writer and he has filled this novel with some memorable characters. Enjoy."
5,As best as a mystery novel can offer,"This is the 1st Myron Bolitar book I read, and beyond my satisfaction, this is a superb book. Not only it offers sufficient twist and suspense to the end of the book, the characterization, humour, romance are perfectly blended in a page turner. It is sometimes shock, sometimes hilarious, sometimes violent and sometimes sexy. Absolutely highly recommended and one of the best in the genre.I am now having a new series of books waiting for me to read, together with Alex Cross and Lincoln Rhyme and Harry Bosch series."
3,Dates Dates Dates,"Like many Amazonians I am a voracious reader. So much so that I don't always remember the titles from the books I have read . OK perhaps I am forgetful as well. But I really hate when publishers and Amazon tout an old book as new. This is done more and more in the industry and I certainly understand the practice from a revenue maximization strategy. From the readers point of view it is often infuriating however to buy a book and later realize that one succumbed to the ""new release"" hyperbole and had in factread the book years ago.Great book. I am a huge Coben and Bolitar fan ..... but please give us the dates of publication honestly."
3,"I'll stick with the ""stand alones""/","I have read 5-6 Coben novels and really enjoyed them, and was anxious to start the Myron Bolitar series. I am just luke warm about it. Yes, the writing is good, and Myron is a likeable guy. While I love sports and am certainly not a ""girly girl"", I did not enjoy the sports agent aspect as much. I would rather a police officer or detective be the center of investigations, not a sport's agent. After reading this, I went back to another stand alone novel, ""Gone for Good"", and enjoyed it immensely. This may be my last Myron novel for awhile."
4,OK book,We enjoyed listening to this book. It is easy to follow and we like the Myron Bolitar series.
5,Don't Read This Book (Unless you like a good series),"Take Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt, mix in a bit more humor, kick him around a bit more, and give him a more mundane job, and you have Myron Bolitar, the main character of Deal Breaker. My wife bought this book thinking I'd like it. Being a bit of a book snob, I began reading it reluctantly, and found my self greatly enjoying the character. He's a likeable fella, and you find yourself wanting to read the entire series."
3,Over the top,"I gave this book 3 stars because it's very readable. I found myself enjoying it and reading through it quickly. But, as I read it, I kept thinking about how unrealistic the characters were. Win is basically a martial arts superstar, wealthy sidekick who will be there to literally blow the heads off your foes at the last second. Oh, and he's also super rich and a near club champion quality golfer. Myron is similarly exceptional - a former college basketball star who now represents the top pro football draft prospect. The story is also overly complex and didn't feel realistic. Over the top and not in a good way.I like realistic crime fiction with realistic characters and stories. This is well written, but it's not believable. Doesn't really work for me in spite of the good writing."
4,Myron versus Alex Cross,"I have read several of Mr. Coben's other novels and enjoyed them so I thought I would try his hero. So far I have been entertained by Myron and enjoy the fact that he isn't jumping into bed with every woman he encounters. It's more about the story and discovering the answer to the mystery that evolves in the story. I enjoy his staff as well as his buddy ""Win"". I don't feel as if I have to totally suspend belivability in his books. Thank you Mr. Coben"
4,GoEs WiTh AlOt,These are shoes that goes with a lot of outfits. Especially browns. Only down fall is the scratches so up a lot.
5,Another great Marley album...,"Seems like another apple didn't fall far from the tree. Just like his Dad and other siblings, Ky-Mani once again shows he can play other styles of music as well as roots reggae, yet keeps the spiritual torch burning, giving thanks and praises to JAH and calling all bredren and sistren to stand strong and trust in the Almighty."
2,A stretch from his father's talent,"I don't expect any of Bob's children to have the same amount of talent he did. This album is sub-par and does not meet the standards of the Marley name as did his brother, Damian's CD Jamrock. I easily gave this CD away."
3,Its just ok!,"I looked forward to reading this little book, after enjoying Mayle's A Year in Provence, but just when I have developed a dislike for the way humans insist on humanizing their dogs I get the opportunity to read this.I know he is writing this from the dogs point of view but...maybe I am just tired, but it didn't entertain me that much!!"
3,NOT a children's book,"Take a quick look at this book and you might think it belongs in the children's section of the library. Not so. While there is no profanity, a few sections are inappropriate for kids. I read it and found it rather boring... and I even like slapstick comedy. Save your money."
5,Beautiful illustrations!,"This is a beautiful book and I absolutely LOVE the bold illustrations. My 2 year old loves reading it and knows what comes next, he loves acting out the song. It is a high point of his day. However, one caution -- it is NOT a bedtime book. It will get the little ones too hyper, spinning and jumping around. Good storybook for the morning or after nap. I would buy it again in a second and it is a wonderful gift idea, too. Fun for parents and kids."
2,I like Greenies but these are too tiny and snap in half,"I'm a fan of Greenies for dogs. However, this size is just too small and almost immediately snap in half. The issue with that is they end up chewing each 1/2 down to a size that is easy to gag and choke on. Part of the advantage to Greenies is that they're supposed to break down to tiny bits that are easily swallowed. These breaking in half defeats the purpose.For puppies and even for grown up tiny dogs I recommend going one size up."
1,Greenies Dental Chews For Dogs,"Consumers Beware of Greenie products for dogs or cats. It contains a very toxic ingriedant called, Menadione Sodium Bisulfite {MSB},which is a synthetic {man made} form of Vitamin K3 and causes cancer, organ damage {kidneys,lungs,liver,and mucous membranes}. It is also in almost All dry and canned pet foods. Chech your ingredients on All of your pet treats and foods. This will kill your pets. Check to see if BHA,BHT,and propylne glycol are listed in your treats and foods, both dry and canned. These Will Kill pets."
5,Greenies Rule,"My dogs (3 pugs and a lab mix) have to have their greenie after breakfast. Now I usually can only afford the teenie size given I have 4 dogs. But when they have been very good, they get a petite size. Please put them on sale again."
3,Great Product But Overpriced,"My dogs love these chews, but they are extremely expensive. They seem to help my dog's breath but I can't buy them regularly because of their price. If they were cheaper, I would buy them by the case load!"
4,Highly Recommended,"I have only used these for about two months or so, but from my observation so far the Teeth seem to be much cleaner.Recommend buying the right size for the Dog involved. Size matters because the cleaning process in directly related tothe time it takes to chew."
4,Go away bad doggy breath!,"My dogs don't have terribly stinky breath and I have Greenies to thank for it. I've tried the knock-off products and to be honest they don't seem as well made, plus my dogs actually seem less excited about them.I ended up buying the large Greenies (pkg of 8) for two reasons. One, the price-point seemed right and two, I have two dogs (60+ lb catahoula leopard dog and a 10 lb terrier mix) and its easy to break the large Greenie into two portions for them. One packages last us about 1 month (1-2 Greenies / week).Our dogs really do love these things. If we present them with the option of a Greenie versus some other treat (say a bone) they invariably take the Greenie."
5,Always great!,A great deal on a product that I always buy. Thanks for making it easier to buy what I need for my dogs!
5,Dog loves these!,"I give my dog a greenies everyday when I get home from work. So after she greets me, she goes and sits next to her treats and waits patiently for one. They smell horrid, but she goes crazy over them and it keeps her teeth nice and clean in between brushing!"
5,Greenies for My Dogs,"I recently found Greenies at Amazon. My dogs love them and I found them cheaper on Amazon than I can get them locally.They are a treat that, also, keeps their teeth cleaner and their breath smells good. When my dogs are happy, I'm happy and with Amazon's price, my wallet is happy!!!!!"
1,Worms in product (twice) and makes dog ill.,"Purchased the first box of the Greenies over the summer for my girlfriends Chihuahua. Dog liked the treats but then began to vomit. Took dog to the vet and nothing found. Soon after, the box contained small worms and larva yet had been kept sealed. Threw this box out.A few months later, ordered another box. Once again, shortly after giving the dog the treat, the dog started to vomit. Took the dog to the vet (again) and this time vet suggested the dog had a stomach infection and gave us antibiotics to provide to the dog.Today, upon opening the box of treats, once again, worms and larva were found.Two boxes, two thrown away. No more Greenies in our future. The manufacturer for certain has a quality control issue on its hands if worms are developing in the product. Both boxes were ordered from Amazon.com.My recommendation? Absolutely find a different treat. Dangerous product - and costly!"
5,Greenies for Dogs,"How well the dogs would eat them. Glad to know the benefits the animals get from chewing them, both for teeth cleaning and breathe. Safety us always an issue."
4,Great value!,"Half the price of Petco, etc. My Auggie looks forward to ""brushing her teeth"" every night just before bedtime :-)"
4,whiten your dogs teeth,"Greenies are an excellant way to whiten your dogs teeth. The costs were much lower here, than what you can buy locally at the dog food stores. They have made a great improvment in my dog(s) breath, tarter and overall mouth smell!"
5,Dog loved it! and not too bad in pricing,"You get 96!!! so you're dog will love it, and it isn't too badly priced. It is definitely a little more pricey at pet stores. Our dog loved it though :)"
5,Greenies,Shipped very fast. Great product for your dog's teeth. I have been giving my poodle greenies ofr years now and my vet said that her teeth are just as white and healthy as a 2 year old dogs. She is 10 years old.
4,Great price for this product,This is a terrific price for this product and quantity. The package always arrives early.
1,Junk - Don't Buy,Fell apart within about 5 weeks of mild use. When tuning veneer cover pulled apart and splintered. Not worth $10.
1,Waste of money!,"We bought this guitar for my 10 year old son as a guitar to start him on. It was nothing but frustration for all of us. It is very poorly made, never tunes properly, and is all around junk. He is constantly irritated at the fact that even if he plays the chord correctly, it still sounds wrong. After questioning a nearby music store about this particular guitar the manager told me that they get at least 5 or 6 a month in for repairs that end up costing the same as the guitar did.Reasons for the ratings: This would have been so much more fun if it wasn't such bad quality. Sure a guitar has incredible educational value, just not this brand. It's like getting a lego set with warped bricks. Durable? I think I have already stated my case.You could consider this for a 3 year old to go crazy on, but it would be cheaper and more educational if you sat down with the tot and made a guitar out of a kleenex box and rubber bands."
4,Good budget priced seat..installs well in most cars,I am a Certified Child Passenger Safety Technician and Pediatric Nurse. Sometimes choosing a seat can be confusing. This seat provides all the basics without alot of expensive extras. Consider having a Certified Child Passenger Technician help you install this seat or any seat you purchase. The service is generaly free. To locate a technician check out the Safe Kids World Wide web site and search for technician locator.
1,bad stroller,"I have this stroller of two years already. There is only one good thing I can tell about this stroller; it is easy to push even there is a heavy child in it and it is full with groceries.The bad parts are that first at all the stroller did not come with a pump and regular bike pump did not fit. I had to go to the bike shop to fill up the tires. Even now time to time I have to go to bike shop to inflate the tires.The underneath basket is smallish and difficult to access. You have to unsnap one side of the basket to put in bigger bag.After a half year use the front wheel start to shake when you go for fast walk. And when the front wheel is in fixed position the stroller start to pull to the right side. After fixing this problem couple months later the problem came back.Tips over easily, when my kids is trying to get in it.The seat is adjusted with one strap on each side, which takes time and patience.The buckles for straps are hard to open and close.It is bulky and heavy."
2,Not as described.,"The picture shows just the ram head, the product also has the text 'RAM' underneath which. I have just used a black marker rather than send it back, fine if your Dodge is a ram....."
4,Still the Best,"EA Sports continued in the Madden legacy this year. Madden is still by far the best football game franchise out there. Best graphics, best gameplay, best extras.A new addition to the game this year, that I love, is the mini-camp mode. The mini games are lots of fun and wicked addictive.They also improved the franchise mode. Now you can scout rookies and see them before you draft them.It will be hard for EA to improve upon this for 2004."
3,Meh...,"if your looking into starting the empire earth series, get the first one, gold edition, while this one is a bit better than EE2 in some ways, its still bad compared to EE 1, empire earth 2 and 3 were taken over by a new company and development team, needless to say, thats the reason why its not as good as EE 1"
5,Great for Pens fans!,"I was in the 2nd grade when they won the cup for the 2nd time, but this takes me back to the days where ""good 'ol hockey"" still meant something."
2,"Cheap, cheap, cheap","I love the game, but the product is incredibly cheap. The board is cheap, thin plastic. Only a few chips and no cards are included. Its worth about 25 cents. I should have gotten one of the other Michigan Rummy games. This one is junk."
4,Michigan Rummy,This game brought me back to a time when family and relatives would sit around the table after holiday meals and play for hours.
2,"Entertaining, but this is a flimsy version","This is a good game, especially for a group. It's easy to learn and easy to play. You need cards as well as more poker chips than the game comes with, and this board is flimsy plastic. Look for a better version."
3,Ok,"I downloaded this book for free, and that's about what it's worth. It drags on and on, and really, not worth your time. I skipped so many pages of whatever, and I can't say that I missed anything. I've read better books."
4,Bitter End,Story was well written and very interesting!!!! Would definitely read more from this author. She knew her plot very well and described the people and places so your imagination could take you there.. Well done!!
5,Great Cave book with color photos!,Great cave book with color photos! This book is packed with geological and biological information in regards to caves! It's fascinating! Amazing photos!
5,Best deal on Amazon,"Love this book, was a steal for what I paid for it.. and side of the artistic name written in cover, it is in absolutely perfect condition. & is now sitting in its just place among some nearly 50 other 2.0-3.5 books, screw 4th Edtion!"
3,Avoid unless playing an evil character,"When I first heard of this book, I was wondering what WotC was thinking when they wrote this book.It's not a bombshell, it's a dud.First, aside from darker tones in the artwork, I would not hesitate at all for a 10 year old to read this book. All it is is an excuse for TSR to give those players who prefer evil characters to have lots of tools that most players are nopt allowed to have.Quite frankly, if one wants to add ""dark stuff"" their campaign, they are advised to simply skip this book and translate the stuff from VAMPIRE RPG to d20. They'd be much happoer."
2,Is this book tastless or laughable?,"This book isn't as evil as Wizards of the Coast said it was going to be. In fact, I wasn't really impressed by it and found 3rd Edition Ravenloft far darker than anything in here. Sure there were somethings in this book that were vile but most of it was laughable. Mr. Cook seemed to be trying to shock people more than anything...Speaking of the demons and the devils, those chapters bore me to no end. They didn't make the fiends evil enough, in my opinion...I wouldn't recommend buying this. It's hardly worth the money, not to mention its rather tasteless in some parts..."
1,Goddamnitman!,"Almost everyone on this review board is lying. This book is definately for adolescents from ages of 12-16. No one else in their right mind would incorperate such boring things as sex and drugs in an RPG for ""kewl factor"". And remember: when playing an RPG you're sitting around the table with 3-10 other MALES. Meaning unless you're homosexual (a lifestyle, not a problem), you're not going to want to have sex in a game.Doesn't anyone else see the Maturity issue here? Maturity means a measure of being mature. Those who incorperate this book automatically aren't. Ah, nevermind"
4,A valualble supplement for DM's.,"The criticisms and praise of this book are well placed, in general. I fear that I am too callous, however, because I found little of the book remotely chafing or offensive. My two criticisms for the book are the ""Mature Only"" warnings, which seem unneccessary, and the inconsistent artwork (previously mentioned).The book serves exactly the purpose I hoped it would: As an interesting resource for DM's to throw new bad guys at the players that they've never heard of and do not know how to counter. It's tiring when players come up against a monster, forget the 4th wall, and reiterate to each other information that the characters would never know about the quickest/easiest way to kill the monsters. Given that my players would never purchase this book, it has already given me material that has surprised them and caused them to really sit and think.If you're a DM looking for new options, this book is a good resource."
5,Moomintroll books are great for all ages!,"My 9-year-old brother read the Moomin books and liked them, while I still read them at 13 years and adore them! The charming Moomins and their friends will delight all ages in this endearing series."
3,Cute Toy,"My sons ages 1 and 2 1/2 both enjoy this toy. It has been dropped a few times and hasn't broke, (which say a lot compared to some of the toys I have purchased recently)I would say that for an infant this is a very entertaining toy, has lots of buttons to push, blinking lights and plays music or talks. My older son likes to sit in the chair and pretend he is driving, I feel it is well worth the money."
4,A handful of Danes trying to establish a Danish Colony in the Mongolian Wilderness,"In the 1920's a small group of Danish men went into the Mongolian wilderness to form a Danish colony. This is the account of one of the groups members. It's a happy story, where he loves the wild and primitive life. Close to nature, with hunters and nomads and the wide Mongolian plains, with high to the sky. They found a farm in the Mongolian wilderness, but eventually, the venture is destroyed by the negative effects of the Russian revolution."
2,A disappointment,"I enjoyed Big Stone Gap and anticipated the sequel, hoping it would further explore the relationship between Ave and Jack. I always found their relationship and Ave's decision to marry him in the last part of BSG a bit shallow minded, with Ave putting her dreams and aspirations aside to become the doting housewife. An easy ending. I was curious to see how the relationship would develop, obviously Ave is a more complex person that that, only to find Ave and Jack smack in the middle of a crisis and serious lull in their relationship. Never having experienced the ""good parts"" which were not fully realized in the first book, I continue to wonder why Ave chose this life. Of course, Ave goes off and attempts to explore herself with a glimpse of her old independent spirit, only to return to BSG and accept all of the fault for the breakdown of their relationship. Pleazzz."
3,could have been better,"The 1st book was better than this one. I did not care for the way the book gave this family ""problems."" They were deeply in love, and yet both considered having an affair. Even after Ava discovers her husband really did have an affair because she was upset about her sons death and not attentive to him, they just fall madly back in love and all is well? What??It is missing the elements of ""stuff"" happening. If you want to read about descriptions and color, blah, blah, then buy it.If you actually like a plot with a little going on and would like for people to delve into deep conversations and have real anger and pain, this isnt the book for you.I felt it was written by someone who really never experienced a real realationship."
1,Pales in comparison to the first book,"I purchased this sequel expecting some of the same warm characters and quirky storylines that made the first book wonderful... and I didn't get any of it. The book is slow, and the story is poorly written. Each chapter felt like torture. If you really want to read this, wait to rent it from your local library, it's just not worth owning."
3,big cherry holler,received on time. Haven't read yet -saving for a rainy day Big Cherry Holler hope this is as good as the first book
2,Good concept but flawed execution,"My daughter (who is nearly two) loved this doll the minute she saw it. It is the perfect size for her and fits nicely in her doll stroller. Her stuffed animals have gotten very dirty from going outside and they aren't washable so I was excited that the doll could get wet. Unfortunately, the doll doesn't dry very quickly, so she has been relegated to a bath toy. We bath her at night and she dries overnight/during the day. This frustrates my daughter. I don't really understand why the whole doll couldn't be made out of the plastic material??????????????????????? That part dries immediately!"
4,Recommended!,"This is one of the first pagan-themed books I ever read and it is written in an approachable, interesting style. Definitely on the must-read list for any gay man who is pagan or interested in pagan belief and practice."
5,Best Gameday yet!,"better than gameday 2002,which was a sorry effort,NFL gameday 2003 allows you to catch tip passes,which is cool,one time i caught a pass when i was lying on the ground after the defender tip the ball,the defense is much better,thank you 989,cuz last year's defense was the worst i had ever seen,the graphics are smooth,meaning really good,theres 3 commentarys,play 20 season in GM,Play Online! you can break tackles which looks really good on this game,unlike the famous 1 hit your down deal, theres tons of new tackles,almost a different tackle everytime!theres training camp where you can learn how to run with the ball,throw,kick,punt and dodge defenders, if you love gameday,but hated last's years version,give this a try, but,if you love madden or NFL Fever,Gameday will NOT match those games,but a better effort this year,atlease rent it,i hope this review is some help."
3,More hype than anything else,"I have just turned in my dreamcast for the PS2 and am also an owner of the PS1. I was excited when I first heard of this and have always been a fan of the Gameday series. However, I was very disappointed in this game compared to Gameday versions on the PS1 and the NFL2k series for the dreamcast. The play was sloppy and the graffics have taken a turn for the worst. Choosing plays make it more difficult because you can only tell what a play is if you have it in the middle of the screen. The anouncers are a plus as well as the opening of the game. Other than that, it just doesn't live up to the hype and the PS1 versions are better."
2,"I have played the demo, here are my thoughts","This game is a definate improvement from Gameday 2001 (the last version i have played) but there are still flaws. First of all, the controls take some getting used to (at least for me, i'm more of a madden fan). Second, the running game is non existent. Picking a play is extremely difficult, especially if you do not want a play in the shotgun. When you are passing, the best way to gain yards whaen the recievers are covered is to make your QB run, the computer will not stop you at all. The graphics are extremely better than 2001, it finally looks like a ps2 game, but the players are too skinny and they never show their faces. and this year they also took time to put everyone's name in the game, which they didn't do in 2001. That is all i have to say for now."
2,Just not for me!,"Liked Bostons other books but struggled with this one.The book was not what I had expected. No way this would ever be possible.By the time I got near the end, I started to skip lines then pages.I quess I didn't realize how middle of the road I was until this one."
2,molon labe!,I'll finish reading it but the book seems to be a self serving manifesto for the Libertarian Party.
5,Page Turner,Great Book. Interesting concept and would love to see the experiment happen. Lot of useful information and technology described. Waiting for another...
4,Blueprint for freedom,"Boston delivers an outstanding book of resistance, and hope.I highly recommend this for those anyone who has said to themselves, ""...OK, but the government is completely out of control... what can we do about it?""While there is a good story line, I think Boston has come out with a unique new type of book. Not quite a novel, not quite a non-fiction... it's almost a hybrid. If there were a section of books called ""self help for freedom lovers"" this book would be at the top of the list.Molon Labe is a blueprint for those who still desparately want to believe that America is the home of the free. It is a well thought out, well researched plan for finding or establishing a ""free zone"". Buy it, share it, plan to move to Wyoming!"
2,Dumbass,"Thank God this dumbass looks like he does, otherwise he'd be broke and homeless. He's an idoit."
2,Marian Helpers,Their efforts were more of a performance than a prayer to me. I found all of it to be distracting. Sorry.Elaine Glenn
2,No Service Available? (And you will need it!),"I bought this watch six months ago---It was a great watch to use in workouts. Unfortunately, I've had to replace both batteries and the watch band has torn twice along the slits next to the holes. The first time it broke I used Superglue, but that won't work a second time. Evidently the company is out of business and emails bounce back. So, what was a good watch six months ago has turned into a worthless paperweight."
2,Second Best on Xbox to NFL Fever 2003,"I am a die hard football fan first and a gamer second. I bought Madden 2003 and NFL Fever 2003 and played them side by side for a week, and Madden has gone back to the store! There is NO comparison to the realistic look and feel of NFL Fever compared to Madden. Sure, EA may have put more features like drills and cards to collect etc. but I bought this to actually play a football game, and NFL Fever allows you to do just that with better graphics and more realism! Not having owned any previous version of either, I gave both an equal amount of time, and even invited several friends to try both and NONE of them chose Madden after playing both. If you own an Xbox, there really is no better choice than NFL Fever 2003, sorry all of you with Sony or Nintendo, you have to settle for second best!"
2,Where's the oxygen mask?,Probably the weakest UFO album I own. Phil Moog appears to have trouble with breathing which requires him to take deep/loud breaths constantly throughout the songs on this album. The song lyrics also leave allot to be desired.
5,Miller was King,"Fast service on quality dvd of my favorite country western singer, songwriter. Been that way since ""King of the Road"" and stays that way. Enjoyable, well done dvd."
5,Back to Basics,"This game is great, and a lot of fun. I bought the sequel to theis game (SOCOM II) and it is very, very amazing, but I thought I should go ""Back to Basics"" to see what the hit game of the year stemmed from.I really like this game, and it's a lot of fun, it also makes you appriciate the work done on the levels. In SOCOM 2 there is the same levels as the first one but they are improved on. You have to Try out SOCOM 2 but try out the First one, it is great.Overview:Fun- 10/10Gameplay-10/10Difficulty-10/10Graphics- 9/10, only because I've seen the awesome graphics of the 2nd one.Overall- 39/40This game is Amazing, although SOCOM 2 is multiple times better...you have to get this game, and you HAVE to get SOCOM 2."
4,Wait for Sequel,"Great game - I've been playing it for months now and love it. However, since the game has been around a while too many geeks have hacked the game so now you go in and play online and some guy walks through walls with a super machine gun and kills you in 2 seconds. It was a great game but now too many people have hacked it. Wait until a sequel comes out."
5,SOCOM is the best online/offline game ever!!!,"SOCOM is awesome!! The graphics are great and the game is pretty easy to play. The offline portion of the game is ok but the online part is addicting! Once you play the game in online mode a couple of times you never want to get off. Its so cool because you get to talk to your teamates and you can have up to 8 people on a team to equal an 8-on-8 game. There is a wide variety of weapons and you get to choose the one that you prefer. You really need to buy this game and get it hooked up online, but if you get it hooked up online, you have to buy a microphone for the game. It is very annoying when you cant talk to a teammate and tell them the plans for a mission. You dont just have to complete a mission in the game, you can: kill all enemies, blow up the enemy base, or secure the hostages. Most of the time you just kill all enemies but the game is great. SOCOM is worth the money. GO BUY SOCOM!!!"
4,cool,This game is really cool. The mature rating on the game is a bad rating the game has good graphics but not good enough to make it look incredibly real. The game is very hard and those 12 and up are most suitable for it. For those who buy the game the headset is the best feature. You talk to your fellow navy seal team and if you the online adapter you talk to the people yr playing with. Let me warn you the 5th mission takes time.
4,"A very good stealth, strategy adventure!","Once you get past the controls, which are a bit discombobulated, US Navy Seals is a very satisfying play for the Playstation 2.I find myself getting frustrated at times as the level of difficulty increases dramatically as the game wears on. I've been stuck on the same episode for some time now, but the infused teamwork aspect adds a unique and necessary dimension for you to succeed. Once you figure out the teamwork aspect, solving the missions comes at a much quicker pace.I give these designers a lot of credit, as teamwork is required for your success as you move through the missions. Not only do you need to learn teamwork, you have to master teamwork in order to master the game. It is one of the few games that entails this kind of strategy successfully.Solid effort!"
2,A very pessimistic story,"I have seen this film twice and it makes me sad and pessimistic. If you like real heroes, do not buy this. It is well-made and acted film, but not for romantics like me. If you can take that all persons in this film are morally suspect, just enjoy it. My heart just is not able to give it more than 2 stars."
2,Great Film - Sound Not So Good,"I was very disapointed with this film ""LAWMAN"" and not because of the film itself, but because of the sound quality of this DVD. The sound was very flat, high pitched and with no depth to the sound at all and that's sad because this is a great film in itself. This is a great Western with an excellent cast, especially the great character actor William C. Watson as Choctaw Lee, the gunfighter. Richard Jordon as Crow was also great. You just don't see great films like this anymore, basically because you don't have actors like this anymore, Burt Lancaster, Lee J. Cobb, Albert Salmi, etc. If someone else purchased this DVD and the sound is great, please let me know as maybe I received a defected DVD. I hope the DVD was defected as I would love to enjoy this film once more."
2,Poor recording of a great concert...,"I'll agree with the reviewer who called it his review ""great artist; poor recording"". I bought this hoping for the same great performance I saw on PBS but the recording process was just terrible for this concert in Salt Lake, UT. The concert music sounded very far away and when Peter Cetera's voice climaxed, the audio muffled which was very annoying for me. The recording wasn't as clear as it was from his television performance which has me thinking the recording process is what is terrible."
2,"Looks good, but . . . .","Tried this product for tennis elbow. Thought it would supply the needed support for golf, but because it wraps your entire elbow with fairly thick Neoprene the inflamed section of the elbow become even more painful, even when at rest. Perhaps it would work as a support after you're recovered from tendinitis, but I have serious doubts."
5,good tips,this book offers many practical tips for everything about pcs. the section on setting up a pc is helpfull.
4,Too small,"I gave it to my mom as a gift because she is a Chemestry TeacherShe loved it, but I still think its kind of small to appreciate itfrom far away."
2,did not deliver,This film had lots of potential but it returned very little. There were very few close ups of the women at the time of orgasm and therefore it was difficult to determine if what you were seeing was real or just some camera tricks. Much of the DVD was dark and poorly lit. The interviews with the women were interesting enough and their bodies were pleasant to look at. Overall this film was way over priced and was very short in duration. Production quality could have been better. I feel a 2 star rating is generous. Consider skipping this one.
5,An excellent meta-view of human evolution,"In this book, Goldschmidt, an emeritus anthropologist, pulls together several strands of scientific work on genetics and cognition into a view of human evolution that provides some deep insights into what makes us human. One of the primary insights that he builds on is the recent discovery of mirror neurons, which allow us to learn through observation. Goldschmidt's idea that the evolution of language and tool making are related is also a valuable one. But most important is his overarching idea that affect hunger is the source of culture; that it is a biological need, yet one that connects us with others, and therefore encourages the cooperation and empathy that makes culture and civilzation possible."
3,Good idea but needs a better screen...,"This is a reasonably powerful chess computer that will certainly give the average chess player a run for his money. Unfortunately, the screen is very difficult to see. You have to hold it just right and really look at the pieces carefully to make them out."
4,Yessongs: pioneering progressive rock on video,"I loved Yessongs the first time I heard it in the mid seventies. When I knew that a video also existed, I began to look for it. It was a long search. Now that I got it, it's a treasure, although I expected that the movie had all of the songs of the records. I also found that some songs in the video are not the same versions of the records. A little dissapointing thing is the picture and sound quality (compare it with Pink Floyd's Live at Pompeii, from almost the same year). Anyway, the video is an important progressive rock testament."
3,Must Have for Reggae Collectors,"This video may be a little boring by today's standards (it's about 10 + yrs old), but the coverage of DENNIS BROWN, LUCIANO, SHAGGY, MAXI PRIEST, YAMI BOLO, AND GARNETT SILK are crucial 'must have' items for any true reggae music collector!The production & editing are excellent (especially by REGGAE standards....as many reggae videos are poorly produced)"
3,Okay thriler,"When I bought this movie I had never heard of it. I'm not sure if this even came out in theaters or not, but since it's only $10 I figured why not. This movie is mostly lame. There are some good moments. Edward Furlong's acting is pretty good and sadistic.There are absolutely no bonus features at all. The only menu is a pop up menu to use while the movie is playing. Still it's not so bad for the low $10 price tag."
1,Cruel Scam,"Cruel false advertising is what THIS is. Put Jaime on the cover (Wearing something she never wore in the movie) with a shadowy monster figure in the background, and everyone will think it's a cool new-age horror film. Hopefully everyone can see through the lies the cover holds, including the fact that Jaime is in this for less time than any other character in the movie. Aside from that, the movie is a lame use of a special FX guy's talent. In this scene we'll lob a head off, and none of the characters will even flinch. How about a finger? Don't worry, he'll just bandage it up and be all right. I hate you Kelsey T. Howard. You're a punk."
5,Architect's Review:,"I must say that as an architect who has been practicing for over 25 years, I have not read any book quite like this before that reaches so deeply into the creation of a master work such as Fallingwater. I have always ""appreciated"" FLW work but only recently have more fully understood what he has accomplished and created in built architectural works that to me borders on magical and genius at the same time. The glossy pictures alone only begins to reflect him as the gifted craftsman he represented. Living in Chicago I get to enjoy much of his work all the time. I'm still enjoying the book and must say your work here is amazing and a fitting tribute to an increbible individual and architect. Thanks for the experience. Jack Svaicer"
3,"An engrossing thriller with a little action. I liked it, but this is another movie you need to be in the mood for. I say B.","""You told me it's worth millions, so I went for it. Now you get to play the hero, and me? I'm hiding all over."" When competitive shooting champion Ken sees an armored van being robbed he uses his quick thinking and shooting to take out the robbers. After he is found not guilty in court he is attacked by the surviving robber. After a discussion unveils a hidden agenda can he overcome his fear and stop it before it's to late. This is another hard movie to review. I did like it, but I was expecting more of an action movie. While there was some action in this it's pretty much concentrated at the end. As a thriller though this is a very good mystery and is worth a watch. The twists keep you watching and interested. This however is another movie you must be in the mood for. Overall, a good thriller that is a good watch, when you are ready for it. I give it a B."
1,"A terrible Tornado movie, but funny!","As someone who grew up in Kansas (the heart of ""Tornado Alley""), I thought this movie was stupid, had poor acting and a poor plot. --I just HAD to buy it!!!!!!Gee, when was the last time that you saw a tornado with a human face that peers in windows? Did you ever see anyone be blown around in a tornado that did not get covered with mud, glass and be copped up with debris? The houses that are hit by the tornado are destroyed, but clean! This movie is Hollywood, not doing research, at its worse!A future cult-classic for mid-america!!!"
4,"Fun, but short lived","It was great fun for my kids that are 5,8and 10 for about a day, so for the price, it was worth it"
2,Go for the bigger one,"The junior version of the Slinky is too light on the ends to walk down steps. It barely bends. Without the weight and flexibility of the larger original one made this junior sized slinky all but missing the fun of walking. (Of course unless the ones I bought are defeative then I'm only complaining about the bads one I have now.)Update 12/20/2009: I counted the number of ""loops"" of the junior and the bigger one. Junior has only 64 while the original has 83. The Junior slinky is only 75% of the number of loops compare to the bigger one. I also tested the plastic junior and it works fine."
5,This is the only ear wash that heals my lab's chronic ear infections.,This is the only ear wash that heals my lab's chronic ear infections. Really that is all that needs to be said.
2,One feature was not playable,"This is a very good transfer and plays very well. If you like Carole Lombard, this is a great start to collecting her films although her more famous efforts are on single DVDs.Best of the bunch is ""We're Not Dressing."" Pre-code humor and gowns, star power galore and fanciful tunes make it the most watchable of the movies presented."
2,"Looks nice, feels bad",This is a very attractive shoe but it lacks any type of support for the arch or ball of the foot. The footbed is very hard. It is an attractive round-toe style which I really liked. Too bad it would be very hard to wear over the long haul.
3,Mary Jane Walkers,"I liked these shoes a lot. I ordered them a little big, and they are holding up quite well."
2,not comfortable,The size is correct for me but since it is not very comfortable and the scrap is hard so I have to return it.
2,Poor fit; can't return.,I was desperate for a new pair of work shoes; I have purchased this Mary Jane from Propet before however the sizing on this was so wide it gapped when I put it on with thick socks. Had a hectic schedule at work and missed the short return period which was barely thirty days. Better to go to Zappos.
4,Works Great! but Hard to clean,"It works great, but it's really hard to clean since you can't wash it. I wish the Pot area would be detachable (like a rice cooker). I love how this machine is so easy to use, and it's perfect for really small batch of food. When it's time to clean the machine though.. it takes like 30 min.. Pouring out the oil.. trying to scrub the inside.. etc. Using wet cloth to wipe since you can't wash it."
4,Allergy Free Cooking,Great cooking ideas for the person with allergies. Also great information about allergies and how they can affect your entire well being! A must have.
3,A good book but far from a complete reference guide,"I could found many of the answers I needed to solve my administration problems, but when I was looking for further information about data replication, the statement was: ""It is a very complex topic that is not discussed in this book"". I was frustated, but I could find many other helpfull information, mostly helping to configure the INFORMIX DB and keep it alive."
2,if you need something small,"As a portable handbook and quick reference it contains some useful information if you need something to carry in your pocket, beyond that I feel if you have a graphics standards or building construction illustrated you are better off. The cost estimation is a bit simplistic but useful, but does not offset the lack of information. Plenty of areas are covered with only the most generalized and basic information. Reason for two stars: should be a 10 dollar notebook."
4,Great product!,"This has so much more back support for the baby than many other bouncer type seats. I also like the fact that it has different incline positions, so if baby falls asleep I can lay him down. It's nice to have the option to let it rock or to stay stationary. The newborn insert is great too...keeps their little heads from flopping when they're so little! I do have to agree with another reviewer...the canopy doesn't stay fully drawn. It inches back some. It still provides plenty of shade, but not as much as it could. All in all a great chair!"
1,disappointing ending,"My husband is a huge vampire fan, and we listened to the cassette tapes on our vacation. Even though many of the descriptive scenes in the book are too graphic, the thread that kept both of us listening was the hope that she would solve the mystery of the woman's death. Unfortunately, the author decides in the middle of the book to abandon the search for the truth, and instead continues to listen to Rath's fruitless stories."
1,A terribly childish and naive treatment...,of a fasinating subject. There are three problems with this book: 1. It's self serving. The author has no special insight into the subject yet she insists on assaulting the reader with her bland opinions rather than reporting the phenomenon. 2. There are no shocking revelations here. Nothing a casual observer wouldn't pick up in a Goth or BDSM club. If Ramsland thinks this is a recent phenom she needs to do a bit more research. 3. If I wanted to know how Anne Rice felt about Vampyres i'd pick up one of her books. The author needs to stop name dropping and riding on Rice's coat tails.I find myself a little angry that such claptrap could be clothed in such an alluring title.
3,a wave of good bad good bad,"While reading the book it's hard to keep in mind the story is true, as you continue on in the book you realize the writer goes off focus of what the story started as and it's really good then it gets stupid and the end was good but really disappointing. All in all it's not a bad read there is just a lot that could have been left out of the book. If the book was a biography of her experience through different vampire culture I could give it five stars, but the story is about the investigation on what happened to Susan Walsh."
5,A Classic,"This was Q's first album after producing the ""Thriller"" album for Michael Jackson. That album had Q's touch all over it.That album was my first introduction to Quincy Jones (I was 20 at the time) . So when ""The Dude"" was released I bought it immediately.I was very impressed once again. It had all the ""slick"" production values I knew from ""Thriller"" and a great lineup of artists.And it introduced the very talented James Ingram to the masses (who would go on to have a number of R&B; hits on his own later).I played ""The Dude"" to death back then.Quincy is indeed a very all-around talented man. From producer, to writer to musician, arranger, conductor and entrepreneur.My only criticism of this album (speaking of James Ingram) is that I frankly got sick of ""Just Once"". I'm still tired of it. It's still payed to death on AC radio.It's a great song, but enough is enough already. :-)In any event, if you've not heard this album, I highly recommend it and most any album from ""Q"" for that matter."
5,Tricky for those who don't get it...,"I have a great affinity for this book for a few reasons, the biggest being there is no longer such scathing political satire that is created in so many layers like this little missive from Roth. The media, literary world, and even the OpEds in many newspapers forget the power wielded and the passion invocked by a well-crafted satire instead of mud slinging and innuendo. The story of Trick E. Dixon and his fervent and funny fight for the sanctity of human life as well as the right to kill anyone who disagrees is the perfect paradox of politics. The persona of Richard Nixon, love him or hate him, is the perfect foil for this kind of dialogue/novel and it is an eerie historical note when so very much of the spirit of Trick E. Dixon was soon to be exposed in our own president. If you vote, read this book. If you don't, shame on you!"
3,Disapointed,"I was so pleased when Louisa Luna released a new book after ""Brave new Girl"" which is by far one of my favorites. I kept reading ""Crooked"" because Luna has such a talented style that you have to know whats going to happen to the main character. unfortunatly nothing much happens and the ending leaves one asking ""why..""? still worth reading if you are a large fan of ""brave new Girl"" but also a little disapointing. Rated 3 stars because Luna has wonderful talent and I have not lost hope."
3,weird,didn't get the chemistry... love johnny but what was he doing with her? Awkward and disappointing. Too bad. Could have been a great story!
3,Not as good as PBS DVD.,"This 1993 95 minute documentary with no supplemental material is superficial and overly laudatory in comparison to the 1998 117 minute plus 39 supplemental minute American Masters DVD documentary, Leonard Bernstein: Reaching for the Note. The 2 pages of printed program notes, compared with no program notes for the PBS DVD, is no compensation. This documentary does include information and video materials about Bernstein, so it is not worthless. And it is cheaper. But if you have the PBS DVD you don't need this one."
1,there's always one and its me,"I received this CD as a Christmas present and thought this was going to be one I'd like cause it sounded right up my alley but well not so much.........It was OK I guess for an amateur but I'm not gonna read these reviews and agree. Sorry but don't waste your money on these one hit wonders, just get the good stuff. Sorry but I gotta be honest."
3,"Ok, but not my favorite","I don't mind the workout, but it isn't my favorite. I can feel it in my buns and thighs but I also find that if I'm not careful to relax my shoulders and neck, it can cause me to have a lot of pain in my back and neck.Oh and also, the black rubber has left some lovely stains on my carpet that were very difficult to clean off. If you have light-colored carpets, might want to put something down before using this."
3,Quite a bit different from what I usually read,"in time travel. Wasn't quite what I expected for romance. Wish I haden't bought this book. I did read it, tho."
4,Simple movie with only a few faults,"I bought his movie purely because I was a huge fan of Paul Popowich in the ""Twice in a Lifetime"" series. This role is certainly different.Paul plays Silver Man, a talented violinist who plays by a beach and sells tapes. He falls in love with the girl in the apartment next to him Tivoli who is with Jake. Jake treats her badly and when Tivoli finally gets rid of him and falls for the mysterious and gentle Silver Man.Overall I loved this film for the acting and the script, with one exception. While I realise that the character of Jake is not a nice person the influx of one particular offensive word from his mouth was at times a little too much. If the swearing had just been toned down a little then I would have given it 5 stars.This is a great movie, but it isn't a movie for children due to the content."
4,Good Generic Code Scanner,This is a great scanner for reading and deleting generic codes. The freeze frame data is also helpful for diagnosing issues. Be aware that this scanner will not read manufacturer specific codes. You may want to shop around for another scanner that includes the manufacturer specific codes. You can find some online that are similar in price that include this ability.
3,Poor quality book!,"I felt this book was fair to read and offered some new items concerning relatively unknown characters in the Cookson Hills during the 1920s and 1930s. The book lack direction and flows all over the place. The photos and documents presented in the book are hard to even see. The author has no endnotes or footnotes, which would tell his readers as to where he is getting his information from for the book. Lastly there is no index. To be considerated a truely good book on nonfiction or true crime, this author needs to get his documentation inside it so his readers can believe what he is stating is true. Photo's and documents need to be in focus for the old and young to be able to read too. In all, I felt Mr. Morgan may have rushed to get this out and he could have done a much better job."
4,Quality Indie Hip Hop,"Quality indie hip hop music for those who crave raw style. This groups sounds as if they have the potential to make it in the big world of hip hop. In other words, I like it."
2,Junk!,"I bought this product last summer. It worked for about a month then I had an issue with the XM receiver not powering on. I sent it back to Delphi, they fixed it and sent it back. It worked for two days then the same problem occurred. I sent it back again, and guess what? It did not work out of the box at all on the 3rd try. The CD player still works so I gave it to my kids to play with. All in all, I ended up paying for shipping three times.....Now I'm gonna buy a Belkin."
5,Just what I was looking for,"I purchased this Delphi boom box about 3 months ago and I'm very happy with it. It's just what I wanted, a portable unit to listen to my XM radio anyplace in the house or out in the yard. I have had no problems with it. Runs everytime and sounds good. The only complaint is that it's a little bulky but it's not that much of a problem. I'm glad I bought it."
1,Cyber King and Queen......YEAH RIGHT,"""This movie was really interesting and realistic"" Yeah,O.k. getting everything you want and singing in the Marble decor school bathroom is REALLY realistic. And I dont understand how... it was 'realistic and something they could relate to'. Oh come on! Do they sing ""hip tunes"" in the bathroom too? No, I dont think so, unless they are ALWAYS are rich and they ALWAYS get EVERYTHING they want..."
1,BOGUS,This movie was so stale. It lasted about 20 minutes if that long. Then it had super stale music afterwards. I can't believe I actually wanted this movie. It was a total waste of money. Don't bother buying it unless you like to waste your hard earned money!
4,mary-kate and ashley vido,i got this last year and i love it. it has it all. it has a stly that is good for any age. the soundtrak is vary good and the polt the only bad thing is that it is not current and ashlkey and her boyfriend don't....... i cant tell you beacsue you got to get this for your cild she will love it
4,Joe Sample classic!,"This is a import, a late 70's analog recording with a slightly better mastering than the US edition. Only slightly. This album is a classic, EVERY track is an excellent example of Joe Sample's signature improvisational style and keyboard lyricism. Just wishthere was a digital remastering of this fine album."
3,Charlie Rich,"This CD had a hard-to-find song on it - -""Tomorrow Night"" A really beautiful rendition by Charlie Rich"
3,More useful for a newbie,"I love the ""Dummy"" books, although I think they are a bit overpriced. Maybe I was a dummy, but I purchased this book after being on the internet for over a year. I guess I was hoping to learn things I had no prior knowledge about. For me, this book basically contained info I already knew. Don't be a dummy like me. Purchase this book while you are a newbie, otherwise you will be wishing you had better spent your money."
2,SIMPLY NOT UP TO THEIR STANDARD,"Simply Red's earlier music was beautifully executed, and I can listen to that music all day. ""Stay"" is a great disappointment and I probably won't listen to it again."
2,Not nearly as good as some of the other logic puzzles out there,"After playing with Thinkfun Chocolate Fix Board game, I thought I would try some others. This one is boring compared to Chocolate Fix, the pieces aren't as easy to manipulate, doesn't store as nice, cards aren't as easy to use. If I was buying just one, it would not be this. We have several games from Thinkfun and they are all well designed and fun."
4,Martina is finally getting the acalades she so much deserves,"To be honest, I purchased this CD purely because I'm in love with the song ""There you Are"". I cannot listen to this song enough. Everytime I hear her vocal range, I get goose bumps. As others have said, such a huge and powerful voice for such a petite woman. I cannot compare her to ANY Pop Vocalist that is popular now. Britany Spears, Jennifer Lopez are NOT EVEN in her league. Although Martina is considered a ""Country"" singer, I can see her successfully breaking into the Pop side of music. Other songs I enjoyed on this CD were: 'Anything and Everything', and of course the catchy ""I love you"". I love you, I think was written much in the form of Faith Hill's song, ""This Kiss"". I enjoy both of them."
4,I Think this is a strong CD and very enjoyable to listen to,Not to often do you get a CD which you can listen all the way through. I think what martina has done is very solid. Now i no huge country BUFF but i think anyone who likes a good melody and good lyrics will enjoy it. i dont think any performer should be put i a set boundry if you can judge the music for what it is you wont be dissapointed
5,Excellent Speaker-Easy to install,No need for a mounting bracket. Niles have flaps that flip out to sit on the drywall. The speakers are amazing. I use them in my morning room and dining room. They have a directional tweeter for optimal sound distribution. I really like. But them on Amazon to save money. The speakers I bought were brand new and aren't knock-offs.
4,Completes my tiger's eye set.,"I have tiger's eye (brown) earrings, a ring, and 2 bracelets, and wanted a short necklace to complete the ensemble. I have a narrow neck and like to wear necklaces choker style and this fits the bill. And, it was FAR less expensive than other places I looked!"
2,"Nice try, but . . .","I was very excited to get this book because of all the stitch patterns in the third section. There's a great variety.Unfortunately, almost every pattern I've tried so far has had at least one error in the instructions. I'm glad I didn't try the beaded scarf, as another reviewer did--I'm not sure I'm resourceful enough to recreate the pattern myself.In addition to the huge number of errors I've found so far, I also feel like the book is rather poorly organized. It's hard to find the information your looking for, due to the way the book is set up.If anyone can recommend something equally comprehensive that isn't full of mistakes, I'd be happy to hear about it."
2,Not a good book for beginners,"I bought this book instead of some of the other ""How to Knit"" books because I could see this book getting me beyond the basics. The problem is that this book very poorly explains the basics. I ended up googling ""How To Knit"" to figure out what I was doing and became much less confused. Part of my problem is that I feel like many of the steps to get from skein to scarf are left out, because I'm always asking myself ""But what about __."" I'm sure that when I become more mastered in the art of knitting I will open this book again.I also agree with another reviewer-this book is very poorly organized."
4,Very good product,"I tend to like my lentils a little firmer than these come out. They taste incredible though, and I would mix them with other grains or used in a soup.Clem"
4,Quicksilver fans Buy this item!,"This cassette features three episodes of the first series ofX-Men Evolution.These episodes introduce important characters of good and bad nature.They introduce THE BLOB,QUICKSILVER and SPYKE even though in series three Spyke isn't a main character.It's best to buy or watch UnXpected Changes first if you don't get the storyline.UnXpected Changes is the first part of Series 1.Xplosive Days is the second part.X marks the Spot is the third partBut you'll have to pre-order the final part out in September 2003.This video isn't as good as some of the episodes in Series 3 but they are a good way to introduce main character.So I believe this is one wicked video.[...]"
3,Not bad.,The series start is decent. Don't expect it to follow old story lines and you won't be disappointed. A pretty good buy for any Marvel or just X-Men fan.
4,A very good second book in a series!,"This is a continuation of historian Daniel Kind and police detective Hannah Scarlett. It's by Martin Edwards, a British author. It's about the Lake District in England. I had never heard of Cipher Gardens before this book. This is where the garden is laid out and items are left buried throughout with clues as to why the garden was created. Of course there's a murder to solve. If you love British authors, you will enjoy reading Martin Edwards. He is right up there with Louise Penny."
4,lots of songs for not a lot of money.,"this set contains 3 downliners sect albums plus a bunch of single/ep cuts. every song fades-in. i don't know what the point of that is, but it annoys me. the other thing that bugs me is that the tracks aren't in quite the same order as the original lps. i guess i'm a bit of a purist. all in all it's a great set and i'm satisfied."
2,Flashback to when only teenagers read SF,"Had I been alive (and reading science fiction) in 1930's and 40's, reading this book would have been like meeting an old friend. However, for a Benford/Niven fan like myself, it is just awful. The main premise is implausible, the technology, both human and alien, does not even pretend to follow any kind of physics, and the plot is utterly predictable. Moreover, while 1940's SF characters lacked any personality - the intended audience, male teenagers, did not need it, - all ""The Black Sun"" characters have ridiculously exaggerated personality traits, as if the author used to the original model were trying to overcompensate. Not worth buying."
2,A pleasant juvenile adventure,"Although The Black Sun is not labelled as a juvenile adventure, it seems best suited for adolescents of all ages (like me!). A drunken star captain and his conniving cohort face outer-space monsters and probably (although I'm not through yet) get saved by the brave young people on board the colony ship."
5,"Wow, faeries and a plot that makes sense","There are a lot of faerie stories out there, and most of them rely on hoary conventions, coincidence, or random magic to get from start to finish. Plot coherence is usually the first casualty of the effort.Well, this is the most entertaining, coherent, satisfying, ""tie-up-all-the-loose-ends"", alls-well-that-ends-well, adventure story that I've ever read in the genre. Humor, romance, excitement, multiple plot threads and sub-plots, engaging characters, and not a hint of the twee or precious.I like everything that Gaiman, (in his own words), ""makes up and writes down"", but this particular effort should appeal to everyone."
3,"Short, cute, fantasy book, I guess","This book has a lot of potential, but it didn't seem to quite reach it. Great ideas for the characters and all, but none were really followed through. Each character had his or her own little story, but none of the stories were elaborated on very much. Example: Tristran walks a six month journey in a night, fine, then he has to walk back. Well he does, but it really doesn't seem like too much happened to him. He did a lot of things, but each was just a quick little episode. They could have been more detailed, and the transitions between them were unclear. Ok, so I'm cynical, but I've definitely read better. Still, it was a very cute story. Good for reading to littler children ( but, um, you might want to edit out for a couple of sex scenes before you do). Not for serious fantasy and sci-fi readers, though."
4,Loved this Book!,"I was given this book by a friend who introduced me to Gaiman's work in a book swap (I gave him a book I loved, he gave me a book he loved).I had expected it to be miserable and dark and suffering and full of too much ""angst"" for me. Instead, it was beautiful, creative, and very funny.I have made a specific effort to avoid Neil Gaimon because of all the ""hype"" around Sandman. I now realize there's a reason why people get so excited -- the man is BRILLLIANT!"
4,It's Good But Does It Completely Satisfy?,"Stardust is a great book. The characters are whole and unique, and the realm of Faerie, and it's inhabitatns, are described beautifully. The story is nothing new, a man goes off on a quest in order to win the heart of his love, but it's what happens on the quest itself that makes the story so charming. The only complaint I have about the book is that I thought it too short. I was so interested in the world of Faerie that I felt cheated that I didn't get to see more by the end of the book. I think this book could have easily been expanded without taking anything away from the core story."
2,Mediocre,"I loved Good Omens and REALLY loved Neverwhere so when Neil Gaimans newest novel came out, of course I had to buy it. Well what I got was a rather dry fairy tale that moved way too fast and had an unoriginal and pretty boring storyline...hey, dont get me wrong- I love Neil Gaimans work, but if you want real fantasy/fairy tale stuff, go with J.R.R. Tolkiens: LORD OF THE RINGS. Now that book is a true classic."
1,not the same,"this is the same title , but thats where the simmilarities end. This book is very small . also there is very very small amount of art inside. Just a small amount above evry few pages .more in the way of decorations. So if you are buying hoping to see Vess art ... . You wont , much."
5,Beautiful book in perfect condition.,"Being a fan of the movie I decided to read the book and I have not been disappointed. The book that I found on amazon was in perfect condition, the illustrations were beautiful, and the book was a very easy read."
1,This should not be marketed to Young Adults.,"I really did enjoy this book, but I am disgusted that it is being marketed as a Young Adult novel. There are two very erotic scenes, and one use of the ""F"" word. I don't even think the ""F"" word was being used during Dickens' time. Shame on you Mr. Gaiman for marketing smut to children."
3,Eerm....,Slightly shocked when I came across a ...explicit scene at page eleven. Good book besides that.
5,Whimsical and still exciting,"Neil Gaiman is a great fantasy Author and I feel really comes to the fore with this book. I have to admit, he really won me over with this one as I was wan't a massive fan ofAmerican Gods- although the critics loved it! If you would like more whimsy and an entertaining read, then you should certainly tryThe First Discworld Novels: The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantasticby Terry Pratchett. If however you would like a great adventure but less of the funny then tryInto The Treesby the little known but excellent J. Alastair Nash."
2,lackluster end,"I was very disappointed with this book. I give Gaiman props for originality and great technical writing, but other than that the book I felt was just eh. The book was bloody but never exciting, I never truly felt that any of the main characters lives were in danger. The end for anyone with a keen eye was incredibly predictable and incredibly anti-climactic. Maybe they'll do a better job with the movie."
3,"Nice read, but too constructed","There is a small village at the edge between fairyland and reality. From this a young boy sets out to bring a fallen start back to his love. Yet he falls in love with the star and stays. This is the simple storyline, which Gaiman expands and embellishes. Written in a florid fairytale prose, the book is an easy and nice read. The scenes and wordings are often very magical indeed. Yet one never really gets rid of the thought that Gaiman sat down and constructed this story: ""Here is a river, but to say 'River' would have been to bland, no, we call it 'A sparkling stream which had run through the dark forests of Elbion and had touched the fair feet of the maiden of Undragil"".Thus in summary, a nice read, good entertainment, but do not expect more."
5,"Jeep Grand Cherokee, top radiator hose, good fit","I purchased this Jeep Grand Cherokee upper radiator hose to a 2004 vehicle with 4.7 motor.The original needed replacement as it was bubbling out, ready for failure. I installed thepurchased hose immedietely, size just right, lenght just right, clamps fitted perfectly well.Good, well manufactured quality item."
3,only a Zappa fan would be happy with this...,"My 3-star rating is the average of 5 stars for the movie itself and 1 star for the DVD. The video is no different from the VHS pan-and-scan version (it looks like you're watching a worn out tape), and the packaging seems pretty cheap. If I had a 5.1 home theater system, I'm sure it would sound fantastic, but I only have a plebian stereo TV to watch this on. But let's face it, the fans have waited long enough for this to be available again, in any format...at least it all fit on one disc!!!"
2,Incredibly tedious experience...,"This film was a disappointment for me, I had never seen it before until this DVD, and being a HUGE hardcore Frank Zappa fan even I found it to be incredibly tedious to sit through. It was just too long and it could have been edited down. I found a lot of it boring and unfunny. It has great moments but as a whole it falls flat on it's face as a film. I found the claymation to be pretty unique and most of the concert footage (not all) was pretty good too, the performance of 'Punky's Whips' is particularly great. I preferred the 'Does Humor Belong In Music?' DVD a lot more. I doubt I could ever sit through Baby Snakes in it's entirety again, thank God for the convenience of DVD Chapters."
4,Zappa in one word:genius!!,"Zappa was one of the most original artists around and still to this day,no one has ever come close to his musical ability and imagination....Zappa never got BORING like Clapton,who keeps coming out the same cd every time.At least Zappa took chances..Could you imagine Clapton coming out with a classical cd??? I don't think so..I mean,Clapton is good in his day and wasn't bad later on,but what has he done now?? Same old stuff...Get over it,MR.SEEKER!!! GET A LIFE!!!"
4,Great Value,"I put together a futon using this mattress several days ago. I have a normal bed, but slept on this the first night to get a feel for how comfortable it was. The second night I fell asleep reading a book. It's a comfortable mattress at a good price."
2,smelled so strong,This product was true to the description and comfortable but when it arrived it had a terribly strong chemical odor. It smelled so strong we considered letting it air out in the garage for a week or so.
4,Good replacement,"Mattress is a good replacement for the original futon mattress for an Ikea full-sized futon that I acquired second-hand. It came well packaged, although some part of the tag had melted onto the fabric and took a while to peel off. Most importantly, I can no longer feel the bars when sitting on the futon as a couch. I've only had it one day, so I am unsure of the durability of this but it looks like it will last longer than the previous (a few years). Very satisfied."
4,Top Notch Performances for Entire Cast,This movie was not highly publicized and not even shown at cinemas in my town and that is a shame because this was such a compelling story with excellent performances by the entire cast. Kate Winslet is always amazing and Patrick Wilson played the part of the underachieving husband to a tee. Jackie Earl Haley was perfect and so deserved the supporting actor nomination.
3,tired intersecting paths retread,"Magnolia may not have been the first of the overwrought 'intersecting paths' film constructs, but it did seem to generate a series of these in its wake. Crash was of that genre and nowhere near the best pic level it was awarded. Babel might be the best of the lot in regards to employing this screenplay formula.So here we are again, but with little to be compelled by. The film is erratically narrated, taking us even further out of 'their lives' and leaving the audience as voyeurs of a frankly uninteresting collection of quiet desperation.The pathetic sex offender and his hapless date are the highlight of the uncomfortable world, but it is not a pretty sight... or a particularly convincing one.I rented this because Painted Veil was not on the shelf. This disc would have been better left on the shelf where I found it. I give it 3 stars for Kate Winslett and the tragic offender, but 1 star for the truly awful ending."
1,disappointed,"Unfortunately not at all a good movie with poor dialog, no spice or chemistry between the characters.I like Kate as an actress but this role should not be part of her career.Very disappointed for the time wasted overall"
3,Academy Awards Material? You've gotta be kidding,"Given the hype about both the book and the movie, this was a let-down. Not bad, per se, just much too predictable and cliche. The book's ending was clearly too dark for the producer, or for his intended mainstream Hollywood target audience. Too bad. It coulda been a terrific film, but ..."
5,Revealing portrait of a city through its buildings,"The best book on Houston that I know. This collection of articles on the architecture of the city captures its aesthetic history (or lack thereof) wonderfully. The book's production quality is clean and beautifully done, and the narratives reveal Houston's vicissitudes - its humble origins, its disinterest in history, its deification of power, and the origins of its sprawl. Excellent."
4,Worth Reading to understand modern SCIFI,"I read this book because of the many raves it has gotten from friends. I liked it, but did not love it the way many other readers do. However, Bester's work is an integral step in the creation of modern sci fi. In many ways his work prefigures great works like Hyperion and Diamond Age. People who love the genre should take the time to read his work, just so they can understand the juncture between the old masters (Asimov, Clarke, etc) and the moderns."
3,"Interesting, but dated...","This book was written in 1956 and the reader can tell. Though there are some uncharacteristically strong female characters in this book (for the 1950's), they all fall in lock step behind some male character in the book and become submissive and completely unbelievable. Each of the lead female characters just happens to fall in love with one of Gully Foyle's pursuers. A testimony to the times in which the book was written. In the 1950's men were not allowed to feel and most of the male characters are either souless or deserve pity of some kind. The tepid of romance in this book was strained with men falling in love with women on sight without getting to know them. It would have been a much better novel without it. Aside from these huge flaws, I found the book an exciting read, full of intrigue suspense and some surprises."
4,Weird tatoo is the key.,"I can't explain the success of this novel. It is in fact well written, but a bit generic as far as good sci-fi novels go. It must then be the weird tatoo of the main character - maybe it allows today's youth (read: dorks reading sci-fi/fantasy) to bond on a higher level with the main character?Otherwise, the story offers a great plot, lots of spaceships, freshly designed societies, and the struggle between the questionable good and limitless evil.A must for any sci-fi reader."
5,Amazing!!!!!!!!,"The first 7 pages had me giddy with excitement! And I'm grateful to say, that it never let up. This is undoubtedly one of my favorite books of all time. It's an amazing story about an ""everyman,"" if you will, and what is possible when you put your mind to it. Now with the modern CGI technology, I certainly hope Hollywood will bring this to the big screen. I don't think a movie will do it enough justice, but will at least bring some well-deserved notoriety to this wonderful book. You would never guess it was written in the 1950's! My only regret is that the next book I read has a tough, tough act to follow!"
1,If I could rate it lower I would have,WARNING! This book contains some of the most graphic description of senseless brutal rape I have ever read in science fiction. I can not believe that this has received so many rave reviews. It must have gotten MUCH better at the end because I could not finish it. It was worse than Stephen R Donaldson's horrible Gap into Conflict book. I loved Demolished Man. I was extremely disappointed in this book. I can't imagine why The Stars My Destination was chosen to be on the list of all time classics. I have read all but 2 of the rest of the books on the list and they are great. This is pure trash. Demolished Man should have been on the list instead.
1,"simplistic, typical 60sh","Simplistic, cartoonish, trivial, liberal novel that should be 1000 words story. All based on one assumption (teleportation) and as old as.... Degenerative book!"
4,"SHARP 13"" LCD TV","Great item. Picture great, sound great, connection choices great.One problem: Being located about a foot away from an under-cabinet radio, the presence (shut off) of this TV produces an annoying ratteling sound in the radio. To eliminate this sound you must unplug this TV from the power source! Or, optionally, move it at least three feet away, which in our case is not practical.Very curious!"
4,Cyril Morin Review,"I purchased this CD on a whim and I have been very pleased with my decision. This music is very provacative and at times mystical. Each track sends the listner to a place far away and lives out a certain senario. I usually listen to this creation when I am flying across the country. Track 4, ""Fragments of You,"" is my favorite place to visit. The vocals are hauntingly ancient yet very familiar. The music is very moving and stunning.I recommend this work to enhance your own private collection and to take you on a journey to places you have never been to"
4,your results may vary,"Signal reception is the real shortfall of this type of radio, it pretty much must have a view of the sky to get signal but the long antenna cord makes it easier. I have found that the radio must sit near a window or at least get the antenna over to one and you will be fine. Bass response isn't all that great but for a carry around radio for working outside, beach, etc. it is just fine. It does have a faint hum in the audio which seems to be a common complaint."
4,Solid but could be better,"Does what it needs to do but trying to find the proper placement for the satellite to get a signal can be a chore, otherwise works well"
5,Its a classic Kenny Album,"Now don't get scared by the young Kenny Chesney. He may look young, but his songs aren't so immature. He has a few great hits on this CD including the title track, ""Me and You"". This song is Timeless and is played at weddings all the time. How fitting is the song though... absolutely. And then his fan favorite is found on this album... which is my absolute favorite KC song ever.. ""Back Where I Come From"" and this is the studio version... which I happen to like more. The song about growing up in the country.. ""Some say it's a backwards place, narrow minds on a narrow way.. but i make it a point to say that's where I come from"". If you get a chance to see Kenny Live.. this is one of the greatest parts of the show.. he has clips of when he was younger. It is a great show. The rest of the cd has some great songs... pick it up.. I promise you won't be dissapointed."
4,Can't wait,"I really have not had time to dig into this book and learn all I can with Photoshop, but I am hoping to real soon. I have glanced at it, and it does seem to be pretty well written and in depth."
5,Little seen but VERY HARD HITTING!,"This ultra-violent, scary yarn of LA cops drifting out of control (and then some) offers great work from actor Scott Glenn and director Mark Lester. Glenn plays the leader of the secret hunter/tracker police unit who would much rather exterminate than incarcerate. Lester found a cold, clear-eye for the material and more than matched his exciting (and otherwise humorous) work on Arnold's Commando. There is very little to laugh at in Extreme Justice; a film that becomes more and more horrifying as it moves along. If you like hard nosed 70-80s cop/action flicks, then this one is probably for you. Extreme Justice is about as brutal & intense as any commercial film I can think of from the era, while the story delivers a real gut punch that haunt me to this day."
3,Poor Quality,"Although the content of this DVD is quite interesting, be forwarned that the quality of production is quite amatuerish. The lighting, framing and achival sources are all incredibly low quality. Also, the copy which was used to transfer to DVD has many video problems.That said, it has some rare interviews with Eldon Shamblin, Johnny Gimble and other Playboys. Most everyone from this legendary band is mentioned . . . . . . . with the BLARING OMISSION of Tiny Moore? Possibly the greatest soloist to perform with the Playboys. Odd. Some great clips, but most can be found on other compilations in higher quality."
3,Sad and scary,"For one reason it's based on a true story and these teens are amazingly stupid, cruel, self centered and amoral...just like in the movie Kids ( by the same director Larry Clark). Bobby is extremely abusive to his ""best friend"" Marty. Marty hates him and did stand up to him once only to be put back in his place as victim by Bobby. Lisa, Marty's girlfriend, decides that they need to get rid of Bobby. She gets her friends and a cousin to come up with a ""plan"" to kill him. They're all a bunch of misfits. The story gets darker and scarier as it moves along. What's frightening is knowing these type of teens are everywhere in America and capable of anything except thinking and caring for others. And it's are collective fault because or lack of parenting and mentoring."
4,about the movie Bully.......,The Story is about an example of a bad society where these people kills when they find that they are unsatisfied with people that they met or having conversation with. Close down of these groups of secret society has been made by government from different country which we can see in the later years that a group of fierce fighter came up so called terrorist. This is the type of problem that are slowly surfacing as years passed by. I hope the recommedation is useful to some whom are interested in this genre of movie.
1,Larry Clark craps again,This movie depicts the said goings on of rich kids with too much time on their hand. Once again Larry Clark delivers a film which is nothing more than for him to see a bunch of teen kids naked. It's Kids but with a murder plot
5,A Spellbinding Masterpiece,"This movie is fantastic in every sense of the word. You get the sense that in real life you can have some financially prosperous families that have some really screwed up offspring. The acting in this film is top notch! Every single person is absolutely believable in this story.Upon watching this film you can really see how someone can be driven to kill and feel vindicated about doing so. But you also see how the feeling of exacting the ultimate revenge can take a toll on your soul. This movie is not only a true story, and a drastic look at very serious issues but it also has a good standing with a comedic and sexual approach throughout. This movie without a doubt gets five stars. I would give ten if I could."
1,Lame.,"I rented this movie a few years ago, because of the fact that Larry Clark did it up (since I enjoyed 'KIDS'). I was highly disappointed. The acting was horrible, though, I like the main two actors in other movies. There was also barely any character development (IMO). I didn't feel compassion for anybody, nor did it make me hate the 'villain', if you will. The movie's based on a true story, but I've seen many better jobs done to True-story movies. Soooo...if you like sub-par acting, some nudity, and nipple-pinching, check it out."
3,kind of an expoitation flick more than anything - thats the good news!,"Firstly I loved KIDS, it was really a groundbraking movie, disturbing,memorable, funny (in a twisted way), thoughtful and had an important social message.Now Bully, based on a true story feels more of an exploitation flick, nothing wrong with those movies, I happen to love them, butwas expecting more of a better ovrall story with more social context, it was believable but gratitious and you wonder why, the hell are we seeing certain scenes (one up a girls legs)Still quite enjoyable, the dvd is adequate but not feature rich by any means, if you like exploitation, and dont expect anything too deep (and can stomach some disturbing imagery) you will LOVE this.If your tastes are weird like mine, go for it! :)"
2,"Gratuitous, shocking...","I enjoyed Kids when I saw it a few years ago, so I rented this because it was a Larry Clark film. I wasn't impressed. I made it through the first twenty minutes before I had to cut it off. It was just ridiculous; full of gratuitous sex scenes that didn't have to be there. Not to mention Rachel Miner's character walked around naked a lot. However, I did see some similarities to some people I remembered from high school. Just shows how it doesn't have to be an innercity...teenage pregnancy, drug use, and violence can happen anywhere."
2,"""Bully""...a silly, voyeuristic fantasy","I have to disagree with the plethora of positive reviews given for this film. I feel that Larry Clark's previous landmark film ""Kids"" used graphic sexual imagery, violence, and rampant drug use to portray characters, a culture, and a story that was very real and very understandable, and for that, ""Kids"" was quite an achievement. Rather in ""Bully"" Clark uses that same shocking imgagery that hes very well known for, but for a story, a culture, and characters that are very unreal, and a plot that is confounding and ridiculous. All this leads me to believe that Clark's supposed obsession with teenage sexuality, which drove him to produce the ingenious ""Kids"", has degenerated to mere voyeurism."
3,Good fun,"Videohound, which I usually trust, gives Gene Autry's movies low ratings. I'm sorry if they're not ""sophisticated"" enough for them. They're missing out. Gene and Smiley transport a British kid to his felon father. Along the way they run into cuties June Storey and Mary Lee. June Storey is beautiful as always and plays one feisty character. This was the first movie I've ever seen Mary in and I was captivated by her. She has such a beautiful voice. The only bad element in this flick was the kid actor. He got on my nerves quick. The song which Smiley and Gene share is so catchy. I played it three times."
2,Predictable,"This book was supposed to be suspenseful, but it was only one thing...predictable. I was able to guess Romeo's identity almost from the start, and the attempts at making just about every character we came across a suspect except the one it turned out to be just enhanced my suspicion. I kept reading more to find out if I was right (and hoping I was wrong) than to find out who did it.I also didn't care for the main character at all. While I understand Sarah had problems and trauma in her childhood, she was totally unlikeable -- to the point I began hoping that they'd catch Romeo, but only after he'd done her in.I also found it annoying how the book fluctuated back and forth between tenses.Quite a disappointment that it was so predictable. Had I turned out to be surprised by the ending, I would've definitely given it more stars."
3,"Good idea, but too short","I love the idea of a DVD (or several) showing old footage of sports events. Wide World of Sports was one of those defining television sports shows of the 1960s and 70s. Why not a 4-hour retrospective, with the opportunity to really show some in-depth highlights? This DVD was fascinating, but with only 1 hour of material it barely had a chance to give us a flavor of the original show."
4,Orion meets Jurrassic Park!,"Damn Ben Bova, you did it yet again! A great read in all genre's. It is like Bova meets Burroughs! A must read for the Godliness in you!"
4,Good enough for Denis Johnson !!!,This book was recommended to me by Denis Johnson at a writers' workshop at the University of Iowa 2l years ago this summer. The book is a great read for the new or fledgling fiction writer which I still am at the age of 76 !!Lynn Naibert
4,Silverware,"Was pleased with quality of tableware. Looks very good on table. Washes well, no streaks or marks and it is a good weight."
2,Rather boring,"I found this movie to be rather boring. Not much character development. Some parts, especially what the children were doing from time to time, were scenes I had to tolerate to get through the movie. Hugh Grant is a fine actor and Mz. Davis was ok, although she looked a good deal older and more world weary than Hugh. I just felt Chopin's transition from avoiding George to loving her was not believable and underplayed."
3,.........different.......................,"ew...... did it have to have so much .......detail..except for all those parts(those of you who have read it, know wht i;m talking about) the book was pretty ok. It wasn't as good as most of RTC's books though."
4,pink cinema,"this is '70's pink cinema and the previous reviewer defined the genre exactly ...""The three stars are mostly for production deficiencies and, at times, half-baked direction and a low-budget production."". so i differ with his review because those qualities are what defined pink cinema in japan's '70's era. if you don't like pink cinema than of course you will not like this. otherwise, his review seems to review the existing circumstances in japan society at the time rather than the movie itself. consequently, it is an unfair review of the movie itself. this movie is one of the notable movies of the time primarily because of the director and the beautiful actress."
2,5 stars for Snooks ..,This is a compilation of New Orleans tunes gleaned from other Blacktop releases .. not a very exciting listen .Blacktop is out of business but Cd's still available on Amazon like 'Out Of Nowhere' convey Snooks eclectic-ness better .
3,A cute book.,I liked this book. It's a Readers Digest kind of trip aroundthe world. Amusing and cute.
4,Good Book,This is a great book on the basics of the law for consumers. It's easy to read and understand. Highly recommend!!
1,awful,"I have been a goldfinger fan since 1996 with their first self-titled album. So of course when i heard that this new cd was coming out i was excited. I just purchased it earlier today expecting good things, seein as how their last cd, open your eyes is one of their best cds. I put this cd in, and i was appalled. Only one word can describe this cd, terrible. I hate it. It is a waste of my money and of my time...Goldfinger has clearly gone down hill with this sad sack effort. If anyone wants to buy this go right ahead. But anyone who is a real Goldfinger fan cannot say that this cd is good."
2,Only for those who don't want really play,"This book is not for people that want to play, cause it uses only the single-finger technique, limiting the student and, worse, giving a bad initial education"
1,Thought I'd give them a try,Nothing to brag about. If you're starving they'd probably appeal more. Pretty dry and HARD. I guess I thought it was going to be more like a cheese cracker.
3,his aaaaaahhhh is distracting,"I liked what I read and I liked his technique okay. He tells you to make the AAAAHHHHH sound. His reason behind it makes sense, but it's not relaxing to me at all. Too much work and it makes my throat dry. What is worse is that he too makes the aaaaahhhhh. I felt that I could of, or maybe did go into the gap but his aaaahhhh pulled me right out.I tried his technique of focusing on the gap between his words which works until he AAAAHHH's. ANd doing the techniqe by myself requires too much thinking, which defeats the purpose of meditating all together."
5,Fast read and great CD for meditation,"Book and CD in the condition advertised. The book arrived as scheduled, and it was packaged well. The CD new and unused, and works wonderfully. I have read the book an I am using the meditation CD in my daily routine. Thanks so much."
4,Excellent Love Ballads,"I would just like to say that ""Valentine"" is the best love song ever. And, ""Happy Girl"" is inspiration for all of us to improve our attitudes. Martina showcaases her vocal abilities so well that she could probably outsing Celine or Mariah. However, the songs get trite and syrupy after to much listening. I put it in every two weeks so."
5,Martina's voice should not be restricted by genre labels!,"Martina's fourth disc applies her formidable pipes to a well-picked selection of songs. While she's marketed as a country singer, everyone I've recommended this disc to has raved about it, whether or not they like country music. Martina is not afraid to evoke strong emotions or address controversial topics in her music. Among the many standouts on this wonderful disc are ""A Broken Wing"", ""Whatever You Say"", ""Keeping My Distance,"" ""I Won't Close My Eyes"", and ""Valentine (her collaboration with new-age pianist Jim Brickman). Buy this disc!!!!!!!!"
4,"A little rough, but great for a history book","Let me set the record straight. This is not an engaging story about the rise and fall of videogames. This is more a historical account of the rise and fall of videogames. Which is a good thing. Chock full of good, reliable information, and broken down by year. This is a fast and enjoyable read, with a great balance of wit and facts. If you can get your hands on a copy, I highly suggest picking one up."
2,Trochanter belt,"Belt itself has not held up well. Approximately 1 month of use and it looks years old. For a short term use, this inexpensive belt is good, but I would recomend paying for a higher quality brace."
5,A beautiful album...from a true country gentleman!,"This album is so smooth and comfortable, you'll want to kick off your old boots, lean back, relax and put your feet up! It's easy to see that this smooth yet down-to-earth country artist once again has a real winner in ""High Mileage"". But, be warned!....the soft, beautiful love ballads and foot-stompin' guitar classics will make you RUN to his next concert! Alan's rich voice is sweet, sexy and hard to resist....and his well-written (and sometimes tongue-in-cheek) lyrics are sure to tug at your heart-strings and make you smile. Buy this CD...and all his others too!"
1,Title Misleads,"I Found This Book Misleading From Its Title. But As They Say And In This Case Its The Truth ""Never Judge A Book By Its Cover"". I expected weird wild and wacky sites that cater to dark vampyric horrorish or possibly sexual sites, weird sites etc. And the weirdest site I saw was pretty mild a wicca site oooh. All I Can Say Is Im Glad I Got My Copy At A Dollar Store. The links are so boring I couldnt even read the site descriptions. Id pass on this one if I were you"
1,The Second Worse Popcorn in the World,"The second worst popcorn in the world! The only thing worse is the Double Cheddar Gourmet Popcorn. Same stale goo covered alien space food. Tried to contact Cornzapoppin no response again! Better stuff available, Garrett's of Chicago is a far better product that arrives with crunch, and at a better price."
3,meh,"My wife and I watch Killers on Blu-ray just this last week and were mildly unimpressed with it. I'm hesitant to say it sucks and so forth, but it really wasn't as good as we were hoping (espcially for the price).I know I'm a nitpicker, but it had gaping plot holes that really didn't make sense.That said, the cast did a good job with what was handed to them.We enjoyed it, but not much."
2,Blah,"Ashton Kutcher is not so great of an actor. Katherine Heigl compliments him being average. The movie was something you watch if there is nothing better on. Not a total waste of time, but something you will leave saying, ""It was okay"""
2,The Killers,terrrrrrible!if you have to watch it - i get it - i did too - but - it just didn't work.
4,Better than expected,"Great characters. Quirky down-home spy is a great character for AK. Sure it was silly, but it was very entertaining."
4,Great workout,"I would call myself an intermediate to advance exerciser. While I still have some weight to lose I've lost 30+ lbs using exercise DVDS. What I liked about this is, it is just as challenging as you make it. It definitely can serve as a beginner DVD (it does have a section that shows you all the moves slowly so you can be familiar with them prior to the workout) but if you put more into it, it can go beyond. I love the punches which is why I thought I'd like this but the biggest suprise was the AB sequence, I didn't think on a beginner workout it would be that intense. True my abs were sore so that might have played a part but I thought the AB section was definitely solid. I enjoyed my workout and worked up a good sweat. I haven't tried the Heavyweight workout yet but I'm thinking it might be a little faster paced which I'm sure I'll love too. This is definitely a workout DVD worth checking out."
1,Completely USELESS.,"I picked this book up out of interest in this subject but knew going in that books on this topic are often hit or miss. File this under the miss column.This book details different personality types while reaffirming to the reader that people don't often 100% fall into any of these categories (to which I agree). It provides insight (albeit limited) into the underlying causes for different personality types but is soooo generic that it really has no real world applicability. With the time it takes you to read this book, you could spend with people and pick up on more subtleties and personality quirks that have some practical merit. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.P.S. - This is the first book I've ever thrown out into the garbage. Its that bad."
4,My 2 year old son loves it!,"A great investment! My 2 year old son must have watchedit 50 times already! I find it pretty silly, but he doesn't!"
3,"yesterday, today, tomorrow ~ who cares?","well this book took a while to finish. i tried to enjoy it, but i could not. the story is about three women, their ""mama pearl"" and a man who spent quite a deal of time together in their youth. mama pearl ""protected and loved everyone"". okay, so we get more than 3/4 of the way through this book (because everybody was busy remembering stuff) and then it is decided that one of the characters is selfish etc. we get everything wrapped up, neat and tidy at the end. what kind of story was this? some kind of feel good, you get what you deserve story. only it was so far off base, there was nothing realistic about it and as an escape clause for a novel it fell way way short. okay enuf for now. i want my money back (but the spine was broken, so it will go to the used book store for a teenager who needs imagination to read)."
2,unbelievalbe,"Unbelievable, I mean that literally. From the very beginning I was wondering, is this just me or is this a really silly story. I had a very hard time believing thirteen and fourteen year olds could support a home and people in it with a newspaper route. The dialogue between the friends was very unrealistic, and so was there behavior. I really don't think a top cop, who is now FBI, would go around threatening to use her gun every time she didn't get her way. I could go on and on with the strange behavior, but all in all I was very disappointed."
4,BOOKS & AUTHORS,"I am very predjuiced in favor of everything that Fern Michaels writes. She is a very fast read, keeps you interested page after page and her characters are very compelling. (Be sure to check out her Sisterhood series--I hope it never ends)"
4,Two for one.,"This is a hardcover book published for the Science Fiction Book Club in 1973. It contains the sixth and seventh books in Edgar Rice Burroughs' ""Mars"" series. The book has a great painted cover by Frank Frazetta.The Mastermind of Mars is about an American soldier in WWII who gets transported to Mars. He ends up as the assistant to a Martian mad scientist. He falls in love with a beautiful girl whose body was stolen by an old hag. Naturally, he goes on a quest to get her rightful body back for her.A Fighting Man of Mars is about a native Martian who goes on a quest to rescue a beautiful kindnapped woman that he loves. That is a typical Burroughs plot, but there are a few twists here that keep it from getting too formulaic. The most intriguing variation on the plot is that he meets a different woman along the way, who may be a better match for him than the woman he set out to save.These are both good examples of pulp fiction that should appeal to fans of ERB."
5,Her best one!,"This CD has a great mix of different styles, and each song has an excellent message. The good thing is that the message doesn't get ""lost"" in the music. And LT has such a powerful voice, you'll love this CD!p.s. Almighty is easily the best song on here, but I guess you can make up your own mind :)"
4,Awesome CD,"I bought this CD for the song ""Almighty"" and every song on it is awesome. I took it to my pastor's wife for her to hear the song since she is fluent in Spanish. She said the Spanish portion of the song was not pronounced correctly and Lauren should have consulted someone knowledgeable in Spanish before she recorded the song."
1,horrifyingly terrible,"This book is completely worthless. Hardly any examples, it mostly just proves a few equations that you might need for some of the homework problems, but even then it doesnt show you how to do most of them. Only giving one star because thats the minimum. would give it zero if i could."
4,One that started it all,This movie is a must for any martial arts video collection. Its Gordon liu's second best movie (Shaolin challeges Ninja # 1). This movie started all the Shaolin monk training movies. You see how this hard headed boy grows up to be a well disciplined Shaolin monk. Even adding a chamber to the Shaolin Temple. This was actually the second movie I got in my collection. If you have not seen this one rent it. But I suggest you buy it for it is a very entertaining movie.
4,It's a classic,This is one of those movies I saw as a kid and had to have on DVD. Like most of the classic kung fuu movies there is an element of comedy mixed in. All in all a very enjoyable movie.The training scenes may be one of the best parts of the movie.
3,"Good movie, so-so DVD","The film presented here on this DVD is really good. Shaolin Master Killer is a Gordon Liu classic, and it's one that fans of the genre should not miss.However, the DVD isn't so great. Non-anamorphic, with a print that wasn't in great shape, the video quality of this disk is just ok. And the audio isn't terrible, but it's nothing special.Recommended for this film."
3,Great beginner's camera,"Small, simple little camera. Great for a first camera. It's very simple but it does have some options if you want to start learning about digital photography, Kodak always makes everything extremely accessible. It's also very durable, I dropped mine a million times, even gotten sand in it and it still works. Batteries don't last very long in it so make sure you get the Kodak Rechargeable ones."
2,Try another,"After taking these prenatal vitamins for a couple of weeks, I'm looking to switch brands. I started getting severely nauseaus. You also have to take 4 of these vitamins daily in order to get the daily dose. I've taken these tablets with food and I've had no relief. I would continue to look for other options if you have morning sickness. There are some prenatals with ginger in order to assuage nauseau."
4,"A nice, refreshing tea","R.C. Bigelow, Inc. was begun in 1945 by Ruth Campbell Bigelow, a tea connoisseur who wanted to offer even more taste opportunities to American tea drinkers. Among the many teas and herbal infusions that are offered by Bigelow is the Cozy Chamomile. Cozy Chamomile has one ingredient - Chamomile flowers. That's it - no fruit, no nuts, just good healthy chamomile.This is a nice, refreshing tea, with that nice chamomile flavor. It's naturally caffeine-free, and is a healthy drink for any time of the day or night - not or iced. I really like this tea and highly recommend it. (By the way, check out the interesting recipes on Bigelow's website!)"
5,Dazzling!,Excellent clarity and sparkle! This is a lovely set that I enjoy wearing. The cut of the stones and the setting set off suits and more formal attire beautifully. Definitely a bargain!
5,So real!,"I loved this book! I loved it! Loved it! Loved it! It was so real that I actually believed everything I was reading. Mr. Rabinowitz left nothing to chance. Everything was explained in such realistic detail, that I even felt as if time travel was really possible. When I put the book down, and came back to reality, I was almost dissapointed that this was, indeed, science fiction. Keep up the good work. I hope you continue using the Alan Gentry character in other stories."
3,Pretty good first attempt,"This album was recorded at home, and sounds it. The production leaves something to be desired. Fortunately, about half the tunes are worth the price. It's not bad as a peek into the beginnings of this band. The songs are curious slices of mundane everyday life: waiting in lines, ironing, etc. Just don't expect it to sound anywhere near as accomplished as Dear 23. Favorite songs? Well, I like ""Paint Me"" and ""The Longest Line."""
1,La Violetera - El Ultimo Cuple,I was unable to watch this movies as they are all Region 1 and I am in the UK - Can you please me know where to return and obtain the refund for this item?ThanksRosa
3,but there's one reason to get it...,"As I recall, this movie is downright awful, and I'm a big FRED WILLIAMSON/Black Action fan... I remember having to force myself to stay awake and to this day can't remember much about the plot beyond ""jewel thief""/""hitman""/made in Italy (?) - - there's two reasons to watch it, however...Funky Soundtrack by the OHIO PLAYERS ! ! !RARE Cameo appearence by the OHIO PLAYERS in their mid-70s peek ! ! !Can't beat that... even if the appearence is only a couple of minutes !"
3,What Do You Expect From a Car Salesman?,"This is a story of a Car Salesman who also scored a lot with the chicks.He visited India for a time and now sings chants for his supper. Though if you buy one of his many CD's, you have heard them all, which is to be expected from a car salesman. OK book though its existance is more to satisfy and soothe the ego (and fatten the wallet) of the author."
3,This movie is so confusing that it is boring,Instead of going from picture to picture they go from picture to blank screen and by the end this movie is so pathetic that it takes a min... just to see what is going to happen next. This movie is a movie that I will say stay away from unless you want a confusing barley intertaning intaresting story. I would have given this movie Two stars but I hate giving movies bad reviews unless they where one of the worst movies I have seen.
5,Best Complete Works of William Shakespeare out there,"It is the most complete, well organized, sized, and bound copy that I could ever find. Being that it is so old, though, and that I am an English major who will inevitably use it all of the time, I plan to have it rebound for the sake of comfort. But, honestly, you won't find a better edition."
5,One of my favorite things,I love this popcorn popper. It makes perfect popcorn and I get to put what I want on it. I use this popper all the time; in fact we're on our 2nd one here. It also makes a nice gift.
4,"Bob Lee Swagger, he's the slyest of them all","Summer entertainment. Much better than the movie and adds much more. Mark Wahlberg did a good job, but too young for the part. Reading the book, had to take his image out of my head.Sum it all up with this and a Jack Daniels""I got a woman who did me good who is now Payne's playtoy. I got a dog that stuck by me when no one else would and ended up in the ground. I got a country that thinks anybody who fought in Vietnam is some kind of crazy sniper who shoots at the president and any man who owns a gun is a crazy man. Those are debts that have to be paid first off.""Looking forward to reading Time to Hunt, which I just ordered next."
2,Snappy - but infantile,"There's no doubt that the pace of this revenge story cracks along, and that the dialogue is smooth and snappy.Unfortunately there is no insight into the psychological effects of murder upon those who are asked to kill. In fact, there is one passage where the dehumanisation of those who are being picked off by the novel's hero is so pronounced, I wondered how he would retain my empathy.This book feeds into the dangerous attitude that addressing the ghosts of one's past demands the use of controlled and effective violence. This is a fantasy which of course lead to sequels for Hunter, but certainly no peace for his hero.I suspect Hunter's an extremely intelligent author and could easily display more insight; but would it bring him as much success?"
2,Abridgement not well done,"If you loved the movie - actually, I should say if you SAW the movie because if you did then you loved it! - and you want to read the book or listen to it, I strongly suggest you stay away from this abridgement. The UNabridged version is better than the movie, and that is saying a LOT, but this audio abridgment is difficult to follow and is way too jumpy due to the details they cut for this abridgment."
2,Why aren't books edited anyone?,"Repairman Jack, in the novel I just finished, grabbed a Stephen Hunter book to read in the airport. I checked Hunter out in Amazon and bough the first four Bob Lee Swagger books. They arrived yesterday evening. I am about halfway though the first one, Point of Impact, and ran across this interesting line on page 290:...the smell of dust and gas filled his ears...Why aren't books edited anyone? This is a Bantam book, not some fly-by-night, publish-on-demand company. I can ignore the grammar errors and comma splices, but this is so bad I laughed aloud and woke my wife. I'll heal, but I won't read this in bed anymore."
5,NAILED BY THIS BOOK!,"This is the only book I have ever read more than twice! This book has captivated me for many years. I am here right now to purchase a copy for a good friend of mine. This is definately something to share and pass on to others. I have read them all Ludlum, Clancy, Grisham, Clavel and many more and this one is the best I have ever read. This book should definately hit the silver screen."
5,Great book!,Excellent book! Kept me on the edge of my seat. One of those book you can't put down. I highly recommend it for thriller readers.
3,Donny Walberg's movie I liked better.,Donny Walberg's movie I liked better. The story is almost the same but the setting is different is all. If you seen the movie I's give this a pass. I would have if I had known it was the same story.
3,Foreign Legion comedy is a typical Laurel & Hardy outing,"Mr. Hardy, disappointed in romance, joins the French Foreign Legion, and takes Mr. Laurel with him! A reworking of an older, similar comedy (BEAU HUNKS), this has more action and a faster pace. Highlights include Stan trying to console Ollie as clumsily as possible, a song-and-dance routine featuring ""Shine On, Harvest Moon,"" and a wild airplane ride. If you like Laurel & Hardy, you'll like this."
3,A COLLECTOR'S ITEM,"Apparently when this film was being made,L&H were both battling serious illnesses.It shows in the film itself.Stan is very thin and sick looking.He looks to be in no condition to make a movie.Oliver is heavier than ever.Three hundred pounds overweight.They both gave me the willies at first glance.However,this being their final film kind of makes it a collector's item for me.I hadn't realised they had been around as long as from the roaring 20s until 1950.Amazing!Another thing that never seems to be mentioned,is the storyline's remarkable simularity to Gilligan's Island."
2,WHAT WENT WRONG??,"Based on the excellent `March of the Wooden Soldiers' from LEGEND films, I was looking forward to this release of `Flying Deuces'. But, I am sad to say that LEGEND has let us down this time round. First of all it was the CUT print they used, and it was very grainy too. To get the best from the colorization I actually had to turn the colour up on my TV!Let hope LEGEND realises they have made an error and do it again with a decent uncut print that does exist.Rob Lewis - The Laurel & Hardy Magazine : [...]"
1,Do not spend your money on this video; not good print quality!,"Do not waste your money on this version by Reel Enterprises! It's not a good quality transfer to video. Instead, watch the Instant Video version by DigiComTV for much better quality transfer to video!"
4,Use care in reading these reviews!,"There is a problem with the way Amazon is lumping reviews together. The review you read is probably not for the product you are looking at in this case.This film is in the Public Domain. Anybody can run off a copy of it. And they DO! You can find prints of varying quality in dollar stores, even.I am writing this under the banner of the Lobster/Kino release, but it will show up on every ""Flying Deuces"" product that Amazon carries. At this time, the only product I can highly recommend IS the Lobster/Kino version. You will read that it is wonderful. You will read that it is awful. The only reason for this nice mess is that review lumping issue.The vast majority of the DVD releases of this film are truly awful. As far as I know, the only one that has actually been restored is the Lobster/Kino disc. Some releases claim to be restored but are not. Please be aware of this before placing your order."
4,Unstoppable,"My 2.5 year old daughter wanted to watch this every day for two months. While she loved the egg hunt episode, she didn't watch the other episodes very much. It's cute and demonstrates that not all Easter eggs have candy inside!"
3,"Improves reception, tho not a lot","This add-on definitely improves reception when used with the base unit, but unfortunately the improvement is not as dramatic as I had hoped. Previously, I had 1-2 bars with the base unit; I now have 2-3 bars. At least I can now make and receive phone calls in my home (which I could not, before). So that's a big plus."
2,"C'mon, Disney! You can do waaay better than this!","My daughter received this as a gift when she turned five. Do not buy this game unless you are willing to spend an hour putting it together and figuring out how to play it. And while you're doing that, your child(ren) will be whining about it taking so long. I was doing okay until it came time to put the two stickers on the spinning wheel. The directions for this part were incredibly confusing, and the directions for how to play the game were about the same. I also couldn't believe that I had to put stickers on the die (first time for everything!). That said, once we FINALLY figured it all out, my daughter loves it. I think it's the ""secret"" aspect of the game she enjoys -- pick three things out of the box without peeking and look for your match to your princess w/o showing anyone else the card to win the game. Still, I had to rate this 2 stars for the poor construction of the game."
1,Don't waste your money!,"My husband and I are both college educated and can't figure this game out for the life of us. Not only are the directions confusing but the game itself is cheap and flimsy. The only time we play it (which is very rare) is when we ""make up"" our own rules. Please don't waste your money."
2,Spinning wishes review,The whole game is very poor quality. The spinner is made of cheap plastic and comes apart when spun. You have to apply number stickers to the die. Instructions too confusing for the age group.Very Disappointed.
3,Mildly Disappointed,"I was sort of disappointed over this game. While it doesn't really have any educational value to it, it does teach the kids how to follow directions and to play along with others. My little sisters who are 4 and 7 loved it, of course because of the princesses. But I was at my wits end trying to explain the concept. The game should be for ages 6 and up. 4 is WAY too young. We played the game one time according to the rules and at the end after taking nearly an hour to get everything set up and explaining it over and over, I had such a headache that I just let them play how they wanted to. My dad and stepmother were not thrilled with me for giving this game. But the girls were happy with it. So, I guess that's all that matters. I would really think about it before I purchased it though, cause its the parents and adults who have to explain it all."
3,Disney Princess Spinning Wishes Board Game,"It's a very cute concept and my little niece sure loved the princesses. She loved putting the little decals on the game pieces. However, the ""spinner"" could have been better designed. It would keep coming off of the game board when you would spin it. Also, the ""aura"" section of the board is hard to see when the ""wishes"" are on the spinner.The rules were pretty complicated for a 4 year old."
3,Keeps a little girl's interest,"I usually go for a game with more educational value but, like many little girls, my daughter loves the princesses. The spinner can be a pain in the butt sometimes with spinning right off the board, but eventually you'll get it. When you first read the directions, they are a little much for a children's game, you will probably have to play the whole game while reading the directions to fully understand what's going on. But, girls love to play it and it keeps their interest with the rolling, spinning, and finding the present at the end. I would recommend it."
2,Not as fun as I'd hoped.,This game is not made well. The spinner in the middle is too loose and the pieces fall out. My 4 yr. old daughter loves the Disney Princess's and I thought this game would be fun for her and it's not much fun nor is it very challenging. I wouldn't recommend it.
1,"Avoid this Bonanza ""collection""!",All these episodes are missing the opening music and introduction of the stars.They start out with the title then go into the opening sequence prior to the Bonanza theme and introduction of the stars and guest star and then continues with the rest of the episodes sans the opening music and star introductions and guest star. If you want the original broadcast episodes don't get this. Each episodes quality differs. You have been warned!
1,Absolutely Nothing,"Used this product twice a day for a month on my Lhasa. It did nothing. No clean hair growing in, No damage control on the stained hair either."
3,Weak but ok,"Ordered this Steadtler pad along with the National version at the same time. The Steadtler version's paper feels lighter and its lines are less sharp. The inch lines (every fifth) are nearly indistinguishable from the others. Not bad, really, but there are better options. i.e. National Brand"
2,Mediocre at best,"Barely reminiscent of D&D, can not max graphics out (3.6Ghz w/HT, 2GRam, Radeon x850 XT)which was disappointing. Looks ok, but game is a real memory hog, and must be played at 1280x1024 unless you have a Ge-Force 7800 (even though ATI logo included on box) Graphics aside, the game is a fun distraction, but not any more noteworthy than that. Not worth initial price, I would wait a year until this one comes down a bit, this is a $25 game at best. Should be mentioned that one of the races is only playable in multi-player, as this was a factor in my shelving the game so early."
1,Dull and UninSpiring,"Very little I have seen of this game so far makes we want to keep playing. In its attempt to be both RTS and RPG is fails. Sound, Graphics, Game Controls just don't do anything for me. Especially the camera control, it has no rotate ability that I have been able to find yet. You are stuck with the basic perspective the game gives you and this gets annoying when you can't rotate the camera to see the bottom of the screen.As the heading says, Dull and Uninspiring. Think I'll uninstall it and get back my disk space.Hail Flavius!"
3,A fine game for the most part.,"When playing offline (not in multiplayer mode), the game is fun with you building your forces and summoning your helpers. But the game play is very short. I hear it is more fun and you have longer game play when you play online. I am not big into online games. Just do not have the time need it to play for hours a day. Am just a weekend/holiday warrior!"
5,A unique story set in a brilliantly contrived world,"PC Hodgell tells the compelling story of a young woman who has lost herself for 10 years and must rediscover who she is amongst the backdrop of Rathilian, a very interesting world surrounded on all sides by the entity known as Perimal Darkling. I thought the Holy City of Tai-Tastigon was very unique, both in its outward appearance and in its internal intrigue. The role of the Kencyrath is vague, but also overwhelming. The whole city of Tai-Tastigon exists, in a sense, because of Jame's people. In unraveling the mysteries that surround the strange city, Jame discovers who and more importantly, what she is. Absolutely brilliant. Read this (and any other books by PC Hodgell) if it is the last thing you do!"
3,Airport Design & Operation,I am not pleased with this particular book for the following reasons:(a) It is expensive and not value for money compared with the other book (Airport Operations) I purchased at the same time for about 60% of the price of this book.(b) The quality of print is poor and it is just like making a photocopy of the original. The background of the table headings is not homogenous and appeared smudgy.(c) The content is not as good as the other book that I purchased and it contained less material. I expected it to be more than the other book.RegardsYeang Goh
5,An extaordinary book,"This reader found Peace's take on conversion to be innovative and helpful. We live in an ""instant age"" (coffee, pudding, credit approval, and even conversion), and Peace reminds us that conversion, like love, is something that is often gradual and needs to be slowly nurtured. The main text and argument are well documented and supported by scripture, and the final section on practical application was a joy to read. Peace gives us back another model of conversion - and one we should not take too lightly. It is after all, the model which brought the original 12 to Christ."
3,Not the 1962 Katharine Hepburn Classic,"For those of you who are thrilled to pieces to have found that this brilliant work will be released on DVD, I might have some bad news for you. I took the liberty to e-mail the President of the studio which is producing this DVD, and he informed me that the version is one from 1973 starring Laurence Olivier. And while Olivier was no slouch as an actor, I think most people will continue to view the 1962 film version to be the superior production. However you feel about it, I thought it would be nice to know what product you are considering. I hope it helps."
3,An uninteresting but educational masterpiece,"After viewing this movie, I thought that it was exactly like any other movie I've viewed in school, boring. While many critics may argue that this was a great piece of art by O'neill, I found it to be three hours of mediocre drama. This is not to say that this film didn't have its interesting parts though. I thought the actors did a wonderful job depicting the lives of the family members and i felt as though this really added to the quality of the movie. Overall I give this movie 3 stars because It was rather boring but it did have its high spots."
4,"Conventions, Cosplaying, Anime, All-ages fun for the family!","For those whose only exposure to anime is through Pokemon and Cartoon Network and those who (especially parents) are left utterly befuddled at why anime is so popular, well here's the comic for you! Breanna, the comic's hero, is not a typical anime fan because she simply isn't a fan! For those wanting to know more about anime and its fandom, this comic delightfully pokes fun at, while not cynically, anime conventions and cosplay; mecha and shoujo genres, all that's chibi and cute, and of course... romantic subplots.For those who are already big anime and manga fans and are looking for a good introductory comic for friends and family, this is it! Seasoned anime fans will appreciate the inside jokes and references of several Japanese names and words used frequently in anime. Plus with good comic direction and artwork reminiscent of Teen Titans, what's not to love about this fun-loving comic for all ages?"
4,Classic Comedy King Fu,"My Young Auntie is very much a shaw brothers kung fu classic. The cinematography and action falls very much in line with these classics. What makes My Young Auntie special is that it stars a woman and is very much a comedy. I can't help but rave about the star. She had a very difficult role, as she had to be both young and insecure, but still a great fighter and strong leader. She did both very well, and the movie was a success. Though I usually don't care too much about special features, I was very impressed with those on this set. They brough back a number of cast and crew, and provided a very good insight into the actual movie. I was very surprised how much fun this movie was, and can't recomend it enough. Give it a try! (And if you do, look for a disguised cameo but kung fu legend Gordon Liu)."
4,lady fighter,Great fighting with alittle comedy it was great i really like her style of fighting it was fast and with class then when the final fight with the dad and uncle was ok
3,"Five stars for the scene, 1 star for the story","Scenes are amazing, history's in the making, grand-grand-parents are so close... Stop! You should realize, that people change with times! People in 17th century were quite different. Period. I understand democracy supporters crying loud over poor guy, but ... I do not believe it at all! Too much flash&fireworks for 17th century, and we never know, why guy was so upset - because of his love, or because he couldn't serve the king. Of course I'm joking, but so it the movie."
1,"Boring, boring, oh so boring...","Half an hour into the movie, I honestly was bored to tears and nearly cringed at this entire film. The only thing that's good about this film is the visuals, but flashy visuals don't mean anything if there's not a story. After just 20 minutes I got tired of watching the actors do nothing more but turn up their noses in snobbery and trying to acquire a French accent, which is not the least bit natural or believable. And Uma Thurman is absolutely boring and lackluster. In general, Vatel was boring. Even if there was an actual story, i wouldn't even care to know."
3,Nice Looking,"Nice looking mugs. They're a bit large though. Coffee cannot be drank quick enough to keep warm due to the large capacity. But, it your a javaa nut and woof down your cup of joe then go for it; you'll like 'em."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"This DVD is nothing more than someone's safari vacation pictures set to music--the home-made type slide show complete with pictures that change into heart shapes, sparkles, etc... between slides. It is very unprofessional--my little girl could do a better job with our vacation pictures and the (very basic) slideshow program on our home computer. There is no action/video footage, no narration, and the music does not even sound like Kenyan music. Do yourself a favor, log onto a travel website where people post trip reports, etc.. and just find some vacation pictures someone has posted there. I have spent several months doing this in research for my upcoming safari trip and not only have I seen pictures as good as and better than the ones on this DVD, but I have learned a lot from the reports and other useful information that other travellers have posted."
4,Rapture in Death,The Dallas series is probably the best ever written by Nora Roberts. I got more enjoyment from these books than I have from any of her others. I can usually take or leave her books. I started this series and had to read them all. When I finished my sister read them all. We can not wait for the new one due out this spring.
1,Awesome,"Loved it!! Just like all of the others, Lieutenant Dallas always comes out ahead! And who doesn't want to be loved the way Roarke loves Eve??"
4,Always a good read,I have never read a Nora Robert's book that was not satisfying. I look forward to reading her books even when all I can get in is a page at a time because life gets busy. Rapture was no exception. I like the way she brings thought provocing ideas into the story; like Nature vs nurture.
2,ok sound but does not fits in ear well,the sound quality is good of this product but it falls so frequently from the ear that i cant use it to listen for a single song while moving or so ...... ll recommend this product if u have big ears...
2,TOO TOO,"Too long, too boring .... who gives a flip about these people? They are stereotyped to the point of ridiculous. Semed like a great deal of filler material. Very disappointing."
2,Don't Go There,"Book clubbers beware! Don't be fooled by the glowing reviews by presumably respectable critics on the inside cover of this supposedly adult book. Going to the Sun is nothing more than a Judy Blume book in disguise, and the disguise is a thin one. Despite a few interesting moments, the best of which is a somewhat graphic account of the lead character's ex-boyfriend being eaten by a bear, the novel concerns itself with the preadolescent preoccupations of a pancreatically-challenged ""woman"" riding her bicycle to Alaska. Her inner-dialogue has all the depth of a diatribe between a 13 year-old and a poster of Leif Garrett. More than one page is devoted to the availability of suitable underwear. I am somewhat ashamed by the fact that I actually finished this book. Perhaps it appealed to the 13 year old girl in me struggling to find a clean pair of panties."
3,Not for Everybody,"If you liked the book, you will probably like the film...If you like golf, you will probably like the film. David O'Hara is a wonderful Chivas Irons..For the naysayers, go watch The Avengers or Battleship.. not everything needs to be non-stop action...and you could probably benefit from a little ""true gravity"". After all, its a solemn and serious matter."
2,Graphics great implementation sucks,"Game eats resources (memory; video;hd), freezes. Multiplayer does not work on any port by 5000, change settings or not. Even there it is impossible to start if you have any kind of network security. I have dual CPU, 1G memory, 256 M video. It does not help performance at all. In fact it display exactly same symptoms as ""Battle of isles"" from UBsoft. I suspect same as BOI they will never make it work - they just do not know how. PS: DVD needs special codex or something; most of the older DVD drives cannot read it."
1,No factory service available after warranty!!!,"14 months after I bought this POS for $279.00 plus tax, it stopped working completely. Okay, I thought I would send it back to Hitachi and they would repair it and charge me for the repair. It turns out that they will not service this product after the 1 year warranty. It says something about their faith in their own product and Hitachi customer support. Three months after I called them I got a call from their customer service department to see if my issue was resolved to my satisfaction. When I told their service rep about their policy, she said that was incredible and she would follow up and get back to me.NEVER HAPPENED.I will never give Hitachi the opportunity to screw me again!NEVER AGAIN will I buy a Hitachi product."
1,"A remake of 1979s ""Birth of the Beatles"" but without the moptop charm.","Thats right, except for a couple of early scenes, this has all been done and better in Dick Clarks view of Beatle begginigs.This film tries to cover too much in too short a time and ends up basically being a collage of 5 minutes each episodes about John and except for a few snippets regarding his father and mother, the Birth of the Beatles covered the same time era and did it with a little more flow and linearity.And just to nitpick, this was the worst looking early Lennon actor ive ever seen. I couldnt even be sure for a few minutes that this was the John Lennon actor, he couldve been anyone."
2,didn't work,"doesn't help much at all for removing my dogs tear stains. understand that it wouldn't keep them away, but it doesn't even remove much."
2,Too much of a hassle..,I have a miniature poodle with a white coat and I have been trying to remove her tear stains with every product out there... I bought this stuff and after the first use I wasn't impressed.. I used it for about three days in a row.. Made a slight difference but.. I'm sorry I just don't have the time to use this regularly and you have to wipe really hard to get the stain to lift and by the time I was done... I could see a lot of redness under her tear stains... I just decided to stop using it because I didn't want to irritate her skin or cause it to burn by continuously using the product. The product smelled medicated... It says you are supposed to use a cotton ball... And it did not work with that at all... So I used a cloth instead.. Ok product if you want to do this everyday to your dog but I don't like it... My search continues.
1,"Good grief, these are nasty!","BLECK! Seriously. Double bleck! Because I apparently have a closed head injury, I ordered the 32 pack of these. Now I have to figure out what to do with 35.5 of them.These taste so burnt that they are inedible. I'm pretty sure they made them, set them on fire, put out the fire and set them on fire again. They leave a disgusting aftertaste and I would rather use them as packing peanuts than eat them. Yes, they are low carb, but I'm pretty sure a rubber tire would be too and I'd rather eat that. Sheesh."
4,i want to buy locally!,why cant we ever find these locally at a grocery store or specialty shop?! why do we always have to add shipping to everything! we should make grocery stores carry items like this. im sick of ordering stuff!
1,SHORYUKEN!!!!!!,"Hardcore streetfighter this is a joke . This is the first six button fighter game to grace the arcade. This game paved the way for games like Killer Instinct, Mortal Kombat,Dead or Alive, and Tekken and many other 2-D game fighters. This movie is a insult to the franchise. If you want the true origin of this movie get the animated version of the movie this is garbage for real."
4,Dumb fun at some of its best,"Despite its lack of attention to the source material it is based on (though it certainly isn't as bad as the Street Fighter cartoon that USA broadcasted for two seasons), this really is just a fun film. So many memorable lines and goofy sequences make it a great party movie for those that like a little cheese in their viewing diet. Plus, it's nice to have an anamorphic transfer of the film with this Blu-ray release, which the super-old DVD release lacked.It's an interesting footnote in the Street Fighter legacy and a fun one to boot."
3,van damme wallop,"Above average for this genre of flick. Story line is better thanmost Van Damme bash ups, but the fight scenes are magic. If you are into this style of movie than this is a must have."
1,Hard to mess up...but they did,"Street Fighter 2 was the ultimate video game at the time of this movies release. The game was simple, you pick a fighter which will challenge other fighters in one on one combat.The game had great characters and simple concept, yet the movie didn't understand that. Instead of hiring great fighters and getting some great fight choreography, they decided to add a ""bad guy trying to take over the world concept.""Street Fighter video game also had many charcters, and instead of just using maybe 8 of the characters, like Mortal Kombat the movie did, they decided to squeeze as many characters into the movie as they could. Then worst of all, the did not have a single street fight in the movie, other than the Guile (Van Damme) vs. Bison (Julia) fight in the end, which is mostly comical, since Raul Julia looks like he can't even through a punch.BAD MOVIE!!!"
1,"Campy, Ordinary, and Surrounded by Tackiness","This movie was at times campy (especially scenes with Bison), the writing was lame (who can forget the line ""I'm going to kick that son of a b**** Bison's a** so hard that the next Bison wannabe will feel it"" which was included in a scene involving a cheap inspirational speech), the action was predictable (there's wasn't enough hand-to-hand combat and when the movie got there, it was ordinary along with the plot which is basically a story about rescuing hostages). To go along with that, the movie is at times surrounded by cheapness. Blanka's make-up work sort of reminded me of the live action Incredible Hulk t.v. series, and somebody must have thought that arcade game controls on Bison's hover craft would be a cheap joke but to me it was just tacky."
1,Its damaged,I Collect DVDs as you will see if you look at my order history. This is a first for Amazon(having damaged product) the two dvds were sliding around in the box an when I opened the box this movie you could hear the dvd slide n around inside with other plastic. I opend the case an the plastic that holds the dvd in place was broken as is the bottem of the dvd case. At this time I havent played it to see what extent of damage is to the dvd as I can see scratches
4,phishtar@hotmail.com,"Once upon a time, there was a bargain-basement black-and-white comic book called ""Eastman and Laird's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."" Part violent adventure, part goofy parody, it spent years at the top of comic book stores' bestseller lists. Then somebody got the bright (and highly profitable) idea to make a cartoon out of it. The movie was an attempt to make both the young cartoon fans and the teenage comic book fans happy, and although this enterprise would seem doomed to fail, for the most part, it works. The Turtles' voices are good, the animatronic bodies by Jim Henson's Creature Shop are frankly incredible, Judith Hoag is good enough and Elias Koteas is very good, and the action scenes are better than some I've seen in 'real' action flicks. A solid and very watchable movie, with some very funny lines. If you like this, you might want to check out some of the collected E & L comic books (which are available through Amazon or your local comic book store)."
5,Still love this from my childhood!,This movie never gets old. Classic. Saw it originally in the theaters with my parents sister and brother. We all loved it and now my children love it!
1,Kaput!,"Worked for a couple of weeks after which it stopped recording. I changed the battery and it worked for about one day after it drained the battery. I contacted the manufacturer to see if it something I was doing wrong and they concluded the sensor was defective. They were kind enough to send me a replacement sensor within days, but unfortunately that one didn't do the trick either. Next time I'll get a different brand."
4,A touching novel,"Someone Else's Son was an unexpected pleasure. It moved me to look more carefully at each of my children, wondering how much of me was in them, or my wife's genes, and how all our efforts to bring them up really mattered. This is a novel for everyone sensitive person to read. Share it with your friends; it has meaning for anyone who ever had a child. It moved my to tears"
3,Mostly drawing instruction,"I wan't as satisfied with this DVD as with other DVDs on quilting that I have purchased. I was expecting to see more examples of finished pieces using pen and ink. I already know how to draw, so I didn't get as much out of this as someone who needs to learn drawing."
4,Decent effort.,"This new - and final - album from the Teen Idols doesn't exactly pack the same punch as ""Pucker Up!"" or ""Full Leather Jacket"", but it's a worthy effort and there are several good songs on here that justifies a purchase. New singer Kevin Sierzega isn't anywhere near Keith Witt's quality harmonic singing, but he does a fine job. Thanks for the punk rock, Teen Idols. RIP."
3,an interesting book with way too many unnecessary details,"hm ... the book is fine - judging by the first 50 pages or so, but it gets boring with too many details, effectively hiding the interesting things.if you skip the boring pages, it's quite fine."
2,Mostly Fiction,"This title should be filed as fiction. Spending several years working in the government section and having intimate knowledge of the inner workings at the NSA a significantly large portion of this book is fantasy.The earlier history portion of the book is very factual but if you are looking to gain insight on how the government ""spies"" on private citizens you won't find it in this title. You can get better entertainment value by watching MI-5."
5,The Puzzle Palace,"Bought this for my Husband and he loved it. He would have rather had a kindle version, but since we only have one and it is MINE.... he settled. [g] It's not a huge book and it's the genre he likes to read. War, military, political, espionage..... It's a ""keeper"". He'll end up reading it several times, then put it on his library shelf to be picked up and read yet again.D"
3,OK,"I wanted to buy the best hits of Teddy. It was hard to find that. I found this CD and is good, although I only found in it 2 or 3 songs that I really liked. Maybe just my personal opinion."
1,Wide-Ranging Information,"What a story! I'm only halfway through this unique journey but must stop long enough to enthusiastically recommend it to everyone - not just nature-lovers. Bruce Stutz has sent me to my dictionary several times (it's fun, learning new words.) He's also entertained me with myths, legends, geography, geology, entomology, etc., and he's challenged me with his deep and important concern for our changing environment. Great book."
1,Why Bother,"If a tech is looking for a book to help guide you through troubleshooting, especially electric heat systems, then continue looking. I'm not sure what level the author was trying to reach, however I was very disappointed. The most use I could find is maybe using it to start a fire in the fireplace."
3,Briefly good,"My kids really enjoyed this game for a couple of days. They were still figuring it out and excited to ""master"" it. The novelty wore off pretty quickly after that. Faster than in many other games they have. They did learn some valuable things from it, but that's where it ended."
4,I never liked her until I saw this movie,Watching this movie made me realize a few things:1) the fact that I never liked her has lot to do with her appearance and certain attitude.2)it must be very hard to be different in this rigid world of classical music.I found myself to examine my prejudices and i find myself actually liking this fine violinist.
4,My Main Man and Trio '64,"This is the first Bill Evans Trio cd I bought-and since then I've listened to moreBill Evans than anyone else;sometimes for a change of scenery,I'll listen to someone else.Actually,this is probably closer to a 5,but I prefer the albums Evans did with say..Scott Lafaro on bass(no,Gary Peacock ain't chopped liver).I'm always impressed by the tunes Evans picks(for example,'Santa Claus is Coming to Town'?);I think...it was on the 'Piano Jazz cd with Marian McPartland that Evans claimed he had like..four rehearsals with his trios over 20 years.In this cd-and in general-it was a practice that brought out the best in Evans and his trios."
2,...quality shows,"This was a quickie put together by a company which could not get liscense to the theme song of the BH. So that snappy little tune we like to sing along to is gone. The DVD menus are terrible and you can barely read the font. However, once you get past all of this and into the actual shows - they are great and uncut. Please know these are all B/W episodes - about 5 on each the discs for a total of 10 shows as I recall. But it if you are a die hard fan and need some hillbilly slapstick - otherwise, with hope the studio will release a quality version of these American treasures."
3,A Good Australian Mini Series,"This package also includes Fields of Fire II & III which almost makes the price justified.Set in the Australian Sugar Cane Fields during the 1940s, this series follows the lives of a group of seasonal cane cutters. Being a TV mini series with a limited budget, the acting, props and special effects are not that great, but the setting and storyline help to make up for these shortfalls. Fields of Fire I is by far the best, with the quality of the others dimishing as the amount of subject matter available reduces. On the positive side, the actors seem to improve as they gain experience (Although, I am not aware of any that have made it to mainstream Australian TV or film). Australian coloquialisms are smeared on thick, and although most of the themes are partly accurate of the times, they should be taken with a grain of salt.In summary, if you are going to purchase an Australian TV mini-series, then this is one of the better ones."
1,Make it stop!!!!!,"there's alot of sickening radio-friendly bulls*it out there and this is probably the worst!!!! Each time I listen to Default i feel like pukeing my guts out!!!!! They sound the same as every Pearl Jam wannabe's out there (Nickelback, Theory of a Deadman).I wish people could appreciate allternitave..."
4,More of the same,"I picked up Default's debut (The Fallout) a few years back and I liked it a lot. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it and saw potential in the band. They can write good basic alternative/rock music. I suppose thats why they're called Default. Its like the medium in rock music. Nothing super special but nothing terrible. Not at all.Today I got their next disc. Their Sophomore effort is more of the same kind of music. I'd say its just as good as ""The Fallout"". As most bands do, this album shows that the band has matured a bit. The music is a bit more ""mature"" than the multi-platinum debut.If you liked their debut, you'll like this as well. Maybe more than their first disc or maybe less. Its worth a look if your a fan of the band. Start with ""The Fallout"" if you're interested in Default but have only heard the singles or any other tracks."
3,Default,"I bought the new Default CD because I loved their debut album. And to say the least, I was very disappointed. Like I said, I loved ""The Fallout,"" but this one just seems to be missing something. So, if you want to save a few bucks......here's an easy way to do it. I wish I had mine back :("
2,Don't Default with Default,"The first album the fall out is the best CD from this band! the new CD Elocation is weak and full of ballady love songs, the first CD had a lot of love songs on it but the whole tone was different giving them a completly new sound as usual Dallas's voice is great but by hearing the first CD you expect better from them!"
4,check out the new defualt,"default has put out a wonderful cd, i love it!! it is a great second record, they mixed up the songs a bit more, there is a more of a contrast in there music, dallas and the boys sound great, i especially love the jeff buckley cover- cruel, and after you listen to the cd, you really need to see the guys play live, they can put on a great show, hope you enjoy this cd like i have"
3,Not What They Said It Was !,"Yeah before I bought the CD it said it was all instrumental but when I received it, the song's were cover tunes, I still like it but it's not my Fav. :~("
2,Nothing Furious about this,"For all long-time Lynch fans who are expecting some great guitar shredding... you won't find it here. Save your money or buy something else. It is a lame collection of cover tunes that George didn't even play rhythm on. He just came in and laid down some solos, and even those solos are boring, uninspired, and lacking the fire that used to make him such an exciting guitarist. Let me say this again: Don't waste your money on this!"
5,My Copy is Not For Sale :),"I came across this book, and noting that it is out of print (How did that happen? This is a wonderful book!), I wanted to say that I think it is not only a wonderful, inspiring book, but that it is also informative, and on the 'must-have' list.It's like catching lightning in a bottle - this is inspiration on paper! :)Toni Donelow Stewart author/illustrator"
3,works okay but difficult to install,I installed the springer on to my trek mt. bike. It fit best onto the frame and would have been perfect except my heel hit ouch. I installed to the seat post but it moved around with the movement of the dog and eventually hit my leg. So I glued it with more and stronger glue it works ok but the seat is now a little to high and might cause problems with my back later we will see. I have a very difficult 60lb mutt who is frightened by everything and this thing freaks her out. She settles down after a few miles but getting her hooked up is a fight. Unfortunately I have been doing a lot of walking avoiding the fight. hope this helps best of luck.
4,Great - in depth and a hard read,Like many really in depth books this is difficult to keep readingexcept between naps. I highly recommend the book and several cups of coffee. The information got me through several projects and was 'just what I needed'. What would be a great follow-on is the 'short attention span' version that more easily indexes the content so I can get directly to the information I want rather than trolling through it 'novel style' to get the story before getting the 'plot'. If it had more indexing then I could find the specific matter more quickly. All that said - it DID have exactly what I needed and wanted and - I recommend the content of this book.
2,Color of the product is deceiving,The color of this skin is really deceiving. I received this case earlier today and the dark shade of red pictured within is far from accurate; the color is more of a dull pink. I really wish that this was depicted more accurately as it seems to be a decent product.
1,"I got Samsung note, not a tablet",I bout it this item for my Samsung note but I get one for a frkn tablet 7inch I am the second customer with the same situation.
2,You can get better for the price,"Paid 10$ for this and I must admit, it's not worth it. For that price, I got a much better and more fuctional case.Received a cheap soft plastic case (probably costs 10 cents to make) and it will simply protect the sides and back of your phone (the less important parts). I don't recommend buying this case."
3,Better options out there,"pros - case looks very nice, i like the red. it is a little lighter red than pictured but it didnt bother me. holes match up nicely. grip on the sides are great and the protection is nice.cons - the edges just dont fit right.. feels like the case is off by a little.. i cant explain it but i wouldnt recommend this product. i will put up pictures if anyone is interested."
3,"Fits well, but seemingly little protection","Goes on easily, fits snugly, and all the holes align correctly. The S-Pen can be removed and inserted with ease. Textured rubber on the sides allows for a firm grip. That all said, this is a very thin polyurethane-like case with very little elasticity. I doubt it provides a lot of shock absorption in the event of a dropped phone. I'm pessimistic that it will offer much protection, but I guess I'll find out."
2,Just ok,"This case is ok , but there are certainly better ones out there for cheaper.I ordered this case with high expectation thinking i was going to recieve a brand name product from Boxwave , instead i recieved a generic case with no branding .There are other cases here on amazon and other sites that are exactly the same thing i recieved for less then half the price this one is being sold for.For some reason my comments doesnt get approved im not sure why , just letting you all know my personal experience with this transaction ."
5,So far so good,Needed a slim case design so my phone would stop slipping out of my hands when taking it out of my pocket. This slim case fits snug and allows all opening on the phone to be accessible. The sides of it have little extra grip grooves. Product is excellent.
3,It works,"It's standard protection, nothing more!! It easily peels off of the phone with the slightest bit of pressure.But it does offer some protection."
3,Hmm...,"There was some valuable information throughout this book in regards to picking up clues and managing your sister circle but other than those little tidbits, I really didn't find this book of any value so I'm going to return it! I give it three stars because it is laid out very well and she gives nice examples. :)"
3,Just ok,"I don't know why but I had high expectations for this book. I read this book in a few hours which is something I rarely do. I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing. If you normally read self-help books for dating, then she's not really saying anything different. I will say that I liked reading it though, just didn't deliver what I thought was going to be delivered.."
5,hilarious look at the world through the eyes of children,Our entire family has delighted in this humorous look at the world through the eyes of Florence's children. Her witty tales made us literally laugh out loud. Our twin daughters saw a little of themselves in each of her richly drawn characters.Forence's insights are obviously gleaned from the experiences of a parent and a keen observation of the tactics that children employ to move mountains of obstacles to their own will. This little book will always be one of our favorites .
5,Get This Book,"Winner's Circle II is an invaluable resource for any new broker starting out. The real life stories and experiences of the most successful stockbrokers in the industry will inspire you to follow in their footsteps. What is especially key about this book are the ideas on servicing your clients the right way. No client wants to feel they have been forgotten or ""sold"". Every broker in the book details how they implement effective communication techniques that keep their clients up-to-date on every aspect of their portfolio so that there are no surprises! There is much more information, just get the book, however I noticed that there are people charging over $138 for this book on amazon. Forget Amazon and buy the book on another site for $20."
3,"Not exactly complete, but extensive... poor translations","The inspiration of Kerouac and Morrison, as well as myself, has never been translated so poorly. Of the works of Rimbaud that I own, this would be my least favorite. Wyatt Mason does no justice to the boy poet who's youth bore the greatest poetry in the last several hundred years.An example (third stanza of the Drunken Boat):""Deafer than a dreaming child, I ranInto winter's furious rippling tides.Penisulas wrenched from shoreHave never know scuh hurly-burly.""Hurly-burly!!!While the tranlator could have been bettered by a first year french student, the amount of work collected in the book is greater than any other volume I own. I especially was excited to see a first draft of ""A Season in Hell."" So if you are looking for a good amount of the french collected in one volume, this books for you, but I wouldn't suggest it if you are looking for a well translated text."
5,Good Product,"I purchased this wheel cover for my Jeep and its great! Of course none of them are ever easy to put on so with my moms hands and myself it was easy as pie! I really like it and the hearts on it are soft and its pretty! Fast Delivery, it really compliments my car"
5,Seizing the Photographic Light,"Overall a great book on the history of photography. VERY comprehensive overview of the evolution of photography. It ties movements in art and social events into photography trends and developments. It also provides insight into how photographers and artists used the medium to express themselves and how experimentation lead to improvements over the years. My only negative comment would be that some of the earlly forms of cameras were not pictured. There were diagrams of early cameras, but after the first hundred years, there is little to no documentation on how they evolved cosmetically/ functionally. It'd be nice to see an example of the various ""groundbreaking"" cameras as they were discussed. Otherwise, a great book."
5,This One Should Receive A Grammy Nomination.....,"I've followed Sherrie' for some time now, and I believe this one is her best to-date. The songs are all great, and Sherrie's songwriting ability really shines. She has the voice of an angel, and this CD really allows her to show it off. As much as I love the title track ""Streets of Heaven"".....her newest single ""Drivin' Into The Sun"" is destined to become her biggest hit yet. You simply can't sit still while listening to this song, and the lyrics deliver a great message. Buy this CD....play this CD....you'll fall in love with it....and with Sherrie'."
3,Beautiful Lamp but Wrong Color,The lamp itself is beautiful and I definitely kept it HOWEVER it is not white it is more of a ivory/tan/yellow/beige family color.
2,Save Your $$$,"I just wasted $21.95!I found this ""book"" to be a huge waste of money. If I could return it, I would!"
5,Inu Yasha Rules!!,"This series is parhaps one of the best series out there. Be sure to pick up this DVD and the rest of them, you will really enjoy this series."
3,RUBY,"AN ABSURD BUT ENJOYABLE EXPLOITATION MIX OF CARRIE, THE EXORCIST,AND THE GODFATHER SET AT A'50S DRIVE-IN SPECIALIZING IN HORROR FILMS[LIKE ATTACK OF THE 50FT WOMAN].IF YOU THOUGHT LAURIE PULLED OUT ALL THE STOPS IN CARRIE WAIT TILL YOU SEE THIS ONE."
1,Not large...medium at best,"Beware!Ad copy says 6""-7"" sponge. The widest point on the sponge I received was 5 3/4"" at the most, and then only measured diagonally across the very widest two points.Very disappointing for the price. Certainly not worth $22.00 plus shipping."
2,Ontrack System Suite 4 is far better for Win XP,"I have both Systemworks 2002 and Ontrack System Suite 4. The latter has many more tools that cleanup, stabilize, and optimize Windows XP. The only Norton programs I find superior are Antivirus and Speed Disk. The rest of the programs are outmatched by the comparable Ontrack programs. The Ontrack registry fixer is amazing, and the cleanup programs are, in my opinion, superior to Norton's Cleansweep. I only purchased Ontrack after discovering that Systemworks 2002 does not have some of the utilities that I liked (e.g, Disk Doctor, Optimize) when running under Windows XP. Ontrack has done a better job of developing a utility suite for XP."
1,Not worth the rebate,"As a PC Technician, I have been using the Norton Utilities since it's start in the DOS days. I have also upgraded to most of the versions. Starting with version 2000, I noticed the lack of control over the software. In other words, the program tries to take over the functions automatically, sometimes making the wrong decision, specially in the case of the Norton System Doctor or Win Doctor.This version is the worst. It almost prevents you from using it manually. In addition, Symantec removed certain features from the previous versions, such as the Benchmark from the System Information module.In my opinion, if you own either version 2000 or 2001, DO NOT GET this version, specially if you are a technician. NOTE: (you will need version 2001 only if you run Windows 2000). If you have never used Norton's before, then you won't notice the differences. However, I recommend making a backup of all you system files before you even install this program. Do not rely on GOBACK alone !"
2,Why didn't I stick with 2001?,"I have always used Symantec products but let me just say I wish I didn't buy this one. I previously ran system works 2001 on a windows 2000 OP with no problems. Unfortunately, the 2002 version does not install properly. Specifically, the Norton Anti Virus drivers and then the subscription issues have left me with a useless computer. I basically had to rebuild the machine thanks to this purchase because the uninstalls went so badly that my PC was left with a mess on it. Usually I would Norton to remove such a mess. You can see the catch 22."
3,Good,"I thought this was good. I have been studying this for a while so there wasn't a lot of new information for me. This is good for starting to understand Angels and Guides. For those who are more advanced, I would recommend Sonia Choquette's, ""Trust Your Vibes"" and ""Ask Your Guides"" She does a very good job of explaining."
5,Exactly What I Was Looking For!,These tapes are great. John is very informative and direct. Explaining chakras and Angel/Guide differences can be confusing! His personal real life stories added in are fun too! John made it all very clear and it made sense too! I am naturally very hyper and it takes a good voice and an interesting speaker to keep me motivated and relaxed. John did it! Thanks John!
1,"Bad examples, NOT clear",The examples are not clear. They only show numbers with no units and do not even explain where the numbers came from. I am a student so I had to buy this book. I would not recomend buying this book unless you absolutly have to. I have seen alot of engineering books and this one is truely one of the worst.
2,"It is ""Beguiling"" That a Film Could Portray Women So Badly","I am giving this movie one star for succeeding in sucking me into the story. I am giving it a second star for the opportunity to watch a young and tender Clint Eastwood.Beyond that....this is one of those movies that ends so badly that I end up feeling resentful for having gotten engrossed in it.This film portrays that a group of women will descend to any and every level, all in the hope of landing a man, and not even a spectacular one at that. I don't think so. This sells women SO short that I don't even know how to adequetely articulate it. Let's just say that The Beguiled is one huge discredit to females everywhere.To the other reviewers that mentioned ""recoiling"" and ""shrieking"" in response to this movie, I say ""spot on""."
5,Excellent Movie!,"Sneaking around spying on eachother....yes thats what females do with one another, especially when theres a man involved..its quite normal..nothing creepy about it....the mere fact that women scorned can be as malicious as this...now thats creepy...but...his character was asking for it. I have a 16 yr old daughter I allowed to watch the movie, considering its an ""old"" movie in her book...suprisingly she enjoyed it, and it kept her interest. GREAT MOVIE."
4,Timeless,This is about a young girl Gail who has been forced to go live with her uncle. Her mother is mentally ill and can't take care of her. Her father has been away for a time.When there is an accident while her uncle is driving Gail decides to run away.She happens upon a family who may be her salvation or not.This book is timeless.I read this years ago in the early 80s and just happen to find it when I was at a used bookstore.
3,lavish 50's film,"This movie introduces two early 60's teen heart throbs,while telling the story of an actress and her black friend/ live in maid.The maid's daughter is very close to white and by pre-civil rights standardsbecomes a problem by wanted to ""pass"" as white.At this time (late 40's early 50's) colored/ black people had to use different bathrooms in the southand weren't allowed in the same schools.So the drama is about the daughters of both mothers and their troubles growing up.By modern standards of color being illegal to discriminateagainst, the film seems strange..."
5,Satisfied Customer,I have always loved this movie ever since I first saw it some 40 yearsago. So when I had a opportunity to make it a part of my permanentmovie collection I jumped at the chance. It is a moving and emotional lookat the status of race relations in America.
3,A Dark Story,This is a sad movie and very much a soap opera. Not one that I could watch very often. That said I enjoyed it. Mainly about a black girl passing as a white girl and her identity problems.
1,Cheap Chinese Version,"The box had Chinese writing all over it, the quality was incredibly poor and the last half hour of the movie did not work at all."
5,True Tear angry Jerker,"I have a lot of classic movies and I thought to myself one day ""Wait I don't have the one classic Imitation of Life"" It's an old classic that will make you upset and confuse as to why in the world this young girl couldn't see how ugly she was in her character, pretty girl but ugly in the inside and yet confused! It's definitely a true classic to have in your collection if you're one to collect great classics. I received this dvd at an economical price and it was in perfect quality so I was well pleased with the merchant who supplied it great job!"
1,Make it stop,"This is truly an example of how Rap music has hit an all time low. The fruit of creative rap has been squeezed dry and the time has come for a change. Typically 3 to 4 years within a new decade the backlash begins and most of us who are fans of originality, creativity and genuine sounds are longing for the new Public Enemy, KRS-ONE, Matronik, Dr. Dre, Whodini, etc. This kid, as strange as it sounds, is the Leif Garret of this generation. Unfortunately, really soon, his career will be relegated to the likes of all those crappy corporate glam rock bands who had their 15 minutes fame. Truly this artist and all copy cats like him have brought shame and the final days to an art form that has run its course. The backlash will force all pop-rap acts like this out of the picture and bring back creative rap artists.Sorry I can't give it zero stars."
5,Lil Bow wow cd,Lil bow wows cd is great to me .If you this so you have very good music things. I know when something is good in music like lil bow wows cd it is off the chaine.Lil bow wow keep up the good work but I got to go so peace out.
4,Lil' Bow Wow Rocks! With A Few Exceptions,"I recently purchased the new Lil' Bow Wow CD, and, hearing from many people that it was horrible, didn't get my hopes up. Unfortunately, I should I have, because this album is just as good as his last one. The only problem with this CD, is that it's SO short. It's only 32 minutes long, and there are two interludes, and an intro which means there are only 9 songs on the whole CD. Although Lil' Bow Wow is one of my favorite rappers couldn't he have put a little more on his CD? Anyhoo, I actually reccomend that you buy this CD if you don't already have it."
5,Stop Hatin,"For all you haters that's talking about lil bow wow's album needs to check themselves just because lil bow wow got it like that. You'll just mad because lil bow wow's talented and you'll wish you were talented so, since you'll ain't got no talent and wish you'll could be like him. In solving this problem all you do is hate so don't get mad just shut the hell up."
2,Disappointing for this Physician,I was hoping to find something that would be more medically related to specific symptoms and treatment options when considering this horrific possibility. The book did a good job of describing the Saran attack in Japan.
3,"weak for barbarians, pretty ok for druids and rangers","This booklet was disappointing. There was very little new information or cool prestige classes for barbarians. If druids or rangers are your thing, they have slightly more interesting content here, so take a look."
2,Production lets Cal down on this one,"Coo Coo Cal is a talented MC, no doubt about it. The first thing that strikes me after listening to this album is however the weak production. Especially the producer Big Hank dissapoints. The beats are boring and sound too simple. One of the few good tracks, ""How does it feel to ya"" is produced by former Naughty by Nature member Kay Gee and this track stands out. Another good track is ""Still ride til we die"". Again the production on this track is a bit dubious but the song sounds good due to the MC skills of Cal and Twista. Except from these tracks the album is boring and will have you sleeping rather than dancing..."
1,Stick with 3M Brand,I just got on here because I was curious of the reviews for this product. We always end up using plastic on windows in the winter because we are suckers for old draft houses. My husband picked this up and Home Depot. And I kept thinking we were doing something wrong. Even though I knew we were not. The tape is HORRIBLE. It pulls away from window itself. Even it is freshly cleaned with no dirt to be found. AND the plastic itself pulls away from the tape. It pulls away when you use the hairdryer to tighten the plastic and as I sit here next to the window we just did it is pulling away with the wind. We will be getting the 3M today. Stay far away from this product!
2,cheap and nasty,"1. The film is cut into pieces that are just too small, I had to really stretch it to cover the whole length of the window. Seems the dimensions refer to the glass, most of us would like to attach the film to the frame...2. Some of the sheets split along the creases when I tried to open them out, rendering them useless3. The tape provided is really not very sticky, so it's tough to get it to stick to the window frames (you really DO need to leave it in place a while and press it down repeatedly). HOpefully this means that it won't pull the paint off the frames come the spring, but I'm not optimistic.COME ON, Frost King, plastic film costs PENNIES. Can't you do better than this?"
1,"Tape doesn't stick if the window sill is cold, yes I'm serious",The title says it all. The product that is designed to make a COLD and drafty window warmer doesn't stick to cold window sills. This product is JUNK.
2,tape doesnt stick,"overall decent product, it shrinks well to look clear when you use the hairdryer...BUT WHY DOES THE TAPE NOT STICK? you dont notice till a few hours or days later, but the tape didnt hold for me. so you get it all done, looks good, and then later the whole thing needs to be redone. i ended up using another layer of tape to secure the plastic."
1,The Tape is Terrible,The two-sided tape is absolute junk. It doesn't stick to much of anything. I had to run painter's tape/masking tap along the entire perimeter of the plastic. I should have gone with the 3M pack.
5,Great DVD player,"My 3yr old son really enjoys this DVD player eEmerson Spongebob Squarepants DVD Player SB329It came with a remote of spongebob as well, it is really great and easy to work. the sound and quality are very good especially since it is refurbished."
5,"Attractive, durable yard ornament","This bird ornament is a nice addition to any yard. It attaches easily to a tree with a nail and resembles an actual bird. I've had one of these for more about 10 years, and the colors are still bright."
3,"Two good stories, and one absolute disaster!","This book contains three stories. The first is When The World Screamed. In this story the formidable Professor Challenger sets out to prove that the Earth itself is a gigantic creature swimming through space. The second story is The Disintegration Machine, wherein Professor Challenger has to deal with a foreign scientist who has created a machine of mass destruction.And now for the unfortunate part: the bulk of this book is taken up by the third story, The Land of Mist. In this story, Edward Malone and subsequently Professor Challenger are introduced to Spiritualism. The story is long (about four times as long as the other two combined), and rambling. A.C. Doyle wrote this story as a polemic, and it makes very poor fiction indeed. If you don't need to read this story, then don't.So, let me sum up by saying that the first two stories warrant 5 stars, and the last warrants one (or zero)."
2,kbaxt,Tried running Scrabble on my new IMAC. Just crashes and freezes.No help from MacSoft. They advised that this version was adapted from the older PC version.
4,Addicted to Scrabble,"I'm wondering why other reviewers have had such a problem with the games on this CD. I use the Scrabble game frequently and have never experienced a crash or any other wierd problems. I'm running the newest OS (10.4.6) on my iBook G4. Maybe others had problems if they were using an older Mac with a slower processer. You may need to have enough memory left on the harddrive in order for the game to run properly. Anyway, I really enjoy this game pack. The only issue I have with the Scrabble game is that their dictionary of allowable words isn't as extensive as the one on my Palm OS. When I've tried to use some offbeat ""legal"" words, it doesn't accept it and I lose my turn! Otherwise, it's a great way to pass the time."
4,"I take it, now my dog does",This seems to help our older dog quite a bit. She is able to get up and down steps by herself most days and no more moaning and groaning.
3,Not enough of the good stuff.,"""Coroner"" is well written and contains some fascinating material. Noguchi was the medical witness to some of the most famous deaths of our time-- including Robert Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, Sharon Tate, and Natalie Wood. Noguchi was also a character covered in controversy-- accused of hogging the spotlight and violating his victim's privacy. Unfortunately for the book, he spends too much time defending himself against those charges and not enough time telling us about his job in greater depth. Given how much time he spent under attack, this is understandable, but it still detracted from the overall book."
3,catchy but i'm not sold,"this cd was catchy, i loved the metal influenced tracks. No One Knows and the Sky Is Falling are my personal favorites. but it didn't manage to stay in my cd player for very long."
2,This One Was Boring!And Too Hyped!,"What a huge let down,I bought Songs For The Deaf because their last release Rated ""R"" was very good!And upon hearing the single""No One Knows""on tv got me thinking maybe this new album would be just as or if not better than their previous effort.But I was wrong!I have listened to the hole cd a few times just to give it a chance.But,I just can't seem to get into it at all.I found most of all the songs to be straight out boring!I only found 3""okay""songs that I found listenable here ""No One Knows""(which is getting played to death already) and""The Sky Is Fallin'""and ""Hangin'Tree"" that's about it.The rest are just straight out boring filler!So don't listen to what Mtv says,their just hyping it up that's all it is,straight out hype nothing more...Just get their last less commercial release Rated ""R"" it is way much better than this boring cd..."
4,"great album, but not innovative","I LOVE this album, it's nothing new; it's just more commercial than their other albums due, largely, to the addition to Dave Grohl on drums. I was not disappointed in this album,it was as I expected. Not as good as their others but still worth a listen.If you're looking for a new sound, pick up Desert Sessions Volumes 7&8. I warn you, though, if you are an MTV enthusiast, you WILL NOT like QOTSA or, mainly, Desert Sessions. Maybe you'd rather pick up a Korn cd or something else largely consumed by 12 year-olds."
4,If It's Too Loud,"Those who fail to find value in this record only validate its title. Queens of the Stone Age has done nothing other than set the benchmark for rock and roll since their self-titled debut. What QOTSA doesn't to do is meet the standard format of radio friendly Fred Bizkit & Co. Queens of the Stone Age isn't about thirty-years-olds pretending to be filled with juvenile angst or faux Satan homage; these boys are straight amphetamines and coffee. Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri, since their days in Kyuss, have been making nothing but great rock'n'roll on their own terms. If you think you love the rawk and you don't own this record, think again. Pure and simple; it's time to embrace the love of QOTSA. The addition of Mark Lanegan (Screaming Trees) and Dave Grohl (Scream/Nirvana/Foo Fighters) only makes ""Songs for the Deaf"" that much more untouchable. Definitely one of the best records of 2002."
2,Okay album for fans,"What in the whole wide world is there about this album that inspires such wild outpourings of praise?This is a collection of middling, forgettable pop tunes broken up by hard guitar breaks and a bunch of disc jockey parodies that get old the second time you hear them.You might call the mix ""experimental"", but there really isn't anything here that hasn't been done before and usually with a good deal more intensity."
1,I tried to like it,"I tried and tried and tried. No matter how many times i listened to this I thought it sounded like a drunk singing!! the songs were boring, not catchy and down right droll!! Only good song is the one m-tv is beating to death. There is way better new bands out there than this, if yea like light new rock, try the Donnas!"
4,don't listen to the haters,"i've never written a review for an album before...but after reading a guy saying this ablum is overhyped i had to chime in. i too bought into the hype after waiting months for a friend to mail me the cd...i couldn't wait any longer. i was afraid because i think dave grohl IS overhyped and predictible and so i figured it was going to be very foo. its not foo. but the haters are right, these guys aren't taking a lot of chances or breaking a lot of rules. and i like rule breaking. but they have a right to be cocky, they are better than the ... that is on mainstream radio. they do hard and catchy SO GOOD. if you want rock n roll to die or you refuse to listen to anything that you didn't know about the day it came out DON'T BUY THIS. otherwise, crank up songs for the deaf ITS STILL OK TO ROCK ! ! !"
2,My little boy was scared of it,"My little boy apparently doesn't like dolls. When we first showed it to him, he wanted it put back in the box. We ended up to potty training the old fashion way."
1,wheel locks,The part number 71631n is listed for a 2012 F150 The lug nuts inside the package are 12 mm.My 2012 F150 has 14mm lug nuts.Amazon is to blame for the mistake.The correct part number for 2012 F150 14mm Gorilla wheel locks is 71601N.Very disappointed.
2,Not what I expected,"I think this book should have been entitled Over 60 and Gettin' Stronger. I'm 46 and I was really looking forward to getting this book in the mail. I think it is more geared to people over 60. Quite a few of the models were much older. I won't get a lot out of this book as far as exercises go. Quite a lot of the exercises weren't using dumbbells. You get the impression from the cover that the exercises will be heavily geared to using dumbbells but this isn't the case. I was disappointed with this book. I recommend Weight Training For Dummies which gives you excellent information and exercises to do. And also, Smart Girls Do Dumbbels by Judith Sherman-Wolin. That book is loaded with dumbbell exercise."
4,Good so far,I brought this phone six months back. So far the phone has been working great. Set up was very easy. Speaker phone works great. Panasonic phones battery life is short. I have to wait and see how long the battery works. So far it has been a great phone with no complaints.Definitely recommend this product.
2,Not So Hot,"I pulled this out of the CD collection for another look a couple of years after I had written it off. Occasionally I do this with albums and kick myself for ""missing it."" Not so with this album, it just doesn't do it for me. It lacks soul, and not because of a lack of blackness as a previous reviewer had stated. It's just uninspired, to hear the likes of Herbie Hancock and James Brown mentioned in comparison to this disc is blasphemy. No really deep funky grooves here, and a borderline smooth jazz feel comes through. Soulive has put out some great material and I have seen some excellent live shows. Check them out if you haven't already. I wouldn't recommend this one though."
2,Not so much...,"I was so disapointed in this little music box. It plays a mini-MINI part of ""Jingle Bells"". It seems to start in the middle of the song somewhere. My young grandkids like it for the little figures but the song is not familiar to them- Duh! Who sings just the middle part :-("
2,Not my favorite.,"1991's ""True Love"" #37, is Pat's take on the Blues. It started out good with ""Bloodshot Eyes"" and ""Payin' The Cost To Be The Boss"", #17 mainstream rock, but after this nothing really stuck to the wall. This album has sat on the shelf now for about 20 years collecting dust. Pat returned to her sound on 1993's ""Gravity's Rainbow""."
5,great blues with pop edge,"as a teenager, i was fan of Pat Benatar's music for it's raw pop power. i bought this cd back in 1991 as a young adult to see what she could do with the blues genre. i liked it then, and love it now. unlike her pop-rock of the '80s this cd has stayed the test of time for me. now that it's in heavy rotation in my cd library, i've come to see what other cd gems i've missed over the years from her."
4,Pat for grown-ups,"Pat Benatar provided the soundtrack to my adolescence - I still have the original, well-worn vinyl release of In the Heat of the Night. Now that I've grown up a little, it's nice to settle into the couch with a scotch and enjoy this album, a respectable foray into the blues by one of the best vocalists of my generation."
2,A honeymoon loser...,"I appreciate her efforts to sing different songs, but this album is the worst PB album I've heard. I agree with the reviewer who said the ""Wide awake in dreamland"" is MUCH better. These songs are not really listenable. I bought this CD on my honeymoon and within a year I had sold it to a thrift store. Luckily, my interest in my wife has lasted longer than my interest in this CD."
4,definetly not for the hardcore.,"don't get me wrong, I like the ataris. but if you are a person who likes hardcore music at all, you will definetly not like this album. the ataris fall somewhere between emo and punk.. leaning more towards emo. if you are going through any kind of relationship chances are the ataris probably wrote a song to describe your feelings. and so I like them because all of there songs are about personal experiences they've had.on another note, the ataris switch to colombia does bother me a bit. but as long as I don't see them on mtv, they don't change their sound, and the cheerleaders at school don't listen to them just because they think kris roe is hot, I'll be okay with it."
3,Flow but slow,"This CD is not officially released and it is not in stores. This is 50 Cent's interscope mix with his G-Unit crew I guess. The beats are not original and are either sampled or taken straight out of other songs. The quality sounds like he did it in a freestyle booth while the DJ played the instrumental. They all got flow, Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo both sound great but the quality is really bad.Delivery: BLyrics: B+Production: COverall: C+"
3,Mediocre Eddy/MacDonald Fare,"The wonderful voices of and personal chemistry between Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald always makes a movie worthwhile.The story revolves around Sarah Millick (Jeanette), a young English woman who on the eve of her arranged wedding, abandons her wealth & social position to elope with Karl Linden (Nelson), her Viennese music instructor and a struggling composer.Living on love alone proves a challenge to the couple and provides both the humor and the tragedy of the story. Bitter Sweet provides several fine songs for both singers and they make the most of them. However, the script is weak and the unsatisfactory ending, which includes the shortest duel in history, spoils the enjoyment of the rest of the movie and leaves the viewer with a feeling of emptiness.If you are a fan of Nelson and Jeanette, don't pass on this one, but you'll find the story isn't up to their talents."
3,"3 stars, 1/2,as for some weak old productions resumed here!!","To me this is an excellent excursion into the remarkable career regarding the activity of K.Emerson as a musician. Since the early sixties He passed through interesting collaborations, as long as He became the most famous keyboards' wizard within the Progressive scene in the UK. it's difficult to choose a particular track here, but I think of his most recent tracks, whose production is very good..instead the old ones are weak from this point of view..it neverminds, this album can follow you, through your car travels all over the world, because it's very relaxing and of course very well performed too!!Good listen!!"
5,New and Improved!,"If you are looking for a great price guide to price out your comicbook collection, then this is the book for you! Fair, realistic pricing, and fine editorial content as well"
4,Great!,"First of all, yes, this is the guy from Blues Clues. No, he didn't die of a drug overdose. Instead, he got together with members of the Flaming Lips and made this great CD. The first track, ""Mighty Little Man,"" sets the tone for the whole album: it's an innocent, uplifting song about a man who likes to watch TV, then gets super-powers. It has crashing cymbals, booming drums, and a fuzzy bass. If you like the Flaming Lips, you'll like this. As the CD continues, Steve sings some beautiful harmonies with Steven Drozd, plays some laid-back acoustic indie-rock songs, and muses about such things as micro-gears and superstrings. This CD isn't aimed at kids, but Steve's childlike enthusiasm is evident throughout, as lyrics about Spider-man and G.I. Joe abound. Don't be put off by the fact that Steve Burns used to be the host of a popular children's television show; this CD is the real deal."
5,What A Surprse!,I didn't know what to expect when I placed this CD into my player. I was really surprised at how well written the songs are and the music is great. Steve Burns sings all the songs and has a great voice. I really enjoyed this CD. Teens and adults would love it.
4,Darn impressive!,"Sorry, no duets with salt shakers here, but Mr. Burns has put out a really really good album. Newsweek even called it ""surprisingly good,"" but it's only surprising if you've never seen ""Blue's Big Musical,"" in which Mr. Burns turned in a terrific a musical/comedy performance. In ""Songs for Dustmites,"" Steve opens with the awesomely crunchy alt rocker ""Mighty Little Man,"" then segues into a more or less mid-tempo journey with some nifty, thoughtful lyrics that somehow winds up coming off Beatles-esque (in a good way.) Throw in some moody ballads that oddly soothe the soul and bear repeated listenings, and you have a disc that merits a permanent slot in your 10-disc changer. A real treat."
5,Wonderful Stuff,"Totally thought Steve rocked as a children's host- he was smart, talented, and entertaining.Better yet, HE STILL IS!I found this album by chance when I was looking around on the internet for info about what happened to Steve after BC. How happy am I that I did!His songs are deceptively simple. They are pleasant to listen to but not so simple that they bore this seasoned musician.You can definately see that Steve has some seriously good influences in his music. Some songs are remniscent of other musicians, but none are carbon copies.You can see the tons of tapped and untapped potential he has and I hope he keeps making music- I'll keep listening!"
4,Satisfied,"Although Panasonic KX-TG5652M 5.8 GHz is not the best cordless phone out there, its performance is quite solid, and considering the diferrence in price between this model and some of the higher end cordless phones out there, I feel satisfied in knowing that I got a very good phone for the price I paid."
3,"Pretty, but doesn't work as well as other options","I purchased two Staple Removers in the same order, this one because it looked nice, and a Stanley Bostitch Professional Magnetic Staple Remover because of it's high Amazon reviews.This unit looks nice, but the other unit costs less and works better. If you need Chrome and don't pull a lot of staples, this unit will work just fine."
1,Misleading,"Showed picture of complete album in picture, It came with no booklet. I love the album but I bought it for the whole thing not just the album, I wanted the booklet!Very misleading to show the booklet in the item description then to not send it... poor service."
3,Updated??,"I didn't have a chance to view this version, but did the author include Hugh Laurie and Richard Branson as guest stars? And she didn't even mention Bob Newhart Alum (and John Carroll University graduate) Jack Reilly and Peter Bonerz! And what about the episodes directed by Robbie Benson? Yes, that Robbie Benson!"
2,Meh....,"I was under the impression that the item would be in better condition than it actually was. The binding was very worn and there are spots on the fron cover where it looks like someone had folded over the corner and left it like that. I don't think that I will be buy another product from them, because not only was I not satisfied with the book but it also took a week longer for them to ship than what I was told."
1,King kool lounge deceptive,This item is deceptive I thought I was getting two lounger but it's only one. I was not happy about that I could have gotten two for just a few dollars more!!
2,King Kool Lounge,"I revceived the 2 lounges I ordered very quickly. thank you. During the first day of use, I noticed that one had a slow leak. I did not return it since I had already disposed of the box. Check your mechandise first. I was floating with my friends when my lounged slowly descended into the depths of the water."
4,great pool float!,"The size is perfectly fine for an adult. You can have your knees bent or hang your legs over the end and the width is very accomodating. Can't beat the price for a lounger, cheaper than at a local store for me. So far has been quite durable and I would order another!"
1,broke,came in with holes in 2 places right form the box.. :( and it was a gift so I cannot return it. I was really hoping to use it!
2,not what I expected,Fast service and delivery. Product not that good and very uncomfortable to Lay on in the pool. Does not hold air very long. So give it a 2 star rating
2,Fun But SHORT,"I made sure to check the size for this before I bought it and at 63 inches (I'm 64 inches) I figured it'd be perfect (esp while sitting up). It is NOT 63 inches. I measured it right before completing this review and it's 55 inches only. So, yes, I can fit on it while sitting but my legs have to be bent. It also claims to be 33.5 inches wide and just now measuring it's about 27 inches (when inflated). The cup holder is completely non-functional. It's low to the water (when you're in it) and it fills with water, so there really is no point. That said, I didn't buy it because it had a cup holder, I just wanted something I could relax in. That it does. It's so far been sturdy and I let my 4 yr old play on it and don't worry that she'll fall out (unless flipped by another child). Hope this helps anyone out there who's taller than I!"
2,"Funky, but not for long","I really liked these earrings when I first got them. With each wear, though, the finish comes off a little more and silver just disappears, leaving chunks of just clear plastic intermixed with the silver color. They're very cute for the first few wears, but be aware they won't stay new-looking for long."
4,Planning and Organizing a High Tech Startup,"I liked this book because it helped me be better at my work which uses technological innovation to develop new products. The book is also helpful in planning a successful high tech startup company or project inside a company because it outlines the factors that contribute to success and failure of new companies and new ideas. For example, having a specific product in mind versus ""I have a cool technology so lets start a company"". Also, it emphasizes thinking about the whole enterprise, not just technology, but how to make a company ""tick"" such as having formal marketing/financing part as well as innovation development part."
2,Mostly Disappointing,"This book should have been called Northern California Camping rather than California Camping. I started reading reviews about places up north, and it gives plenty of descriptions and commentary. They're much longer than the ones in Los Angeles. I don't think he's camped down here. Just compiled a list of campsites here. Also, his rating scale is very questionable. One campground I know to be a virtual parking lot, he gave a 9 out of 10 rating for. I should have bought a different book.This book will be helpful if I decide to take a camping trip up north. otherwise, thumbs down :("
3,"Good book, rotten title...","This is a good book with a ill-conceived title. The implication is that strong women are slim--therefore weak women are fat?? Come on folks, Aren't we beyond such negative stereo-typing? Especially in this day and age, when we know that perhaps the major contributor to 'slim-ness' is a person's genetic make-up? Think."
1,"Guess I Misread This Film, But I Can't Re-View It....","Wow. I just read the six previous reviews--all favorable, most with solid evidence. However--I thought it was simply, and only, a tedious, cheaped-out, boring sequence of ""bad guys chasing each other upstairs and downstairs, upstairs and downstairs, all within the cost-efficient setting of an old warehouse."" After reading the other reviews here, I still can't understand how I could have been so mistaken....."
3,It's OK,"There are a few good songs here. The production gets a bit tedious. There could be a bit more fire in the playing. Nothing really inventive going on here. I differ from the earlier reviewer who claims that Juliana's stuff sounds different with every CD. It's quite similiar. If you're a fan, you'll like it; buy it. If not, you may tire of it quickly. It's worth a shot, though."
1,Characters poorly developed plus too boring to finish,"I only got about 1/3 through this book because it was written in the first person and I couldn't relate at all to the weird narrator or any of the other unrealistic characters, plus it was boring."
1,I wish I hadn't read it!,"It looked like from the reviews that people either loved it or hated it. Since I already had the book & have liked other BTB I decided to chance & read it. Most of the book was OK. The ending however was totally ridiculous! For those of you who want to take a chance & read it, it is a fast, easy read. Maybe you will be one of those lucky ones who loved it. For me, I wish I hadn't wasted my time."
5,Waiting for the next one to come out!,"I have both Jazz-a-Bye Lullabye Classics and Jazz-a-Bye Christmas. I love them, my god son loves them and my nephews love them! I heard rumor that they were releasing another CD in mid Jan. 2002. I can't wait!"
4,Very helpful and detailed,"Prima's book is a must for Zelda. It has all the locations of extra hearts, Gold Skulltlas, and magic beans. The book also has detailed dungeon maps and gives you a lot of help wih the bosses."
1,Music for Hive Dwellers,"Star Trek fan since original series here. Soundtrack does support film's unfolding. Goldsmith IS a gift to mankind generally. Credentials being given, let me state that this is one of the most unlistenable CDs ever. Not designed for the HUMAN ear, the you-know-what must have commissioned it. 90% totally a wreck giving headaches when attempted to endure it several times. Goldsmith must have been in need of quick cash to lend his name to anti-music here, despite what anyone may propagandize he could not have been the true auteur. Western and Eastern modalities seldomly appear, listen to MPs VERY CAREFULLY before shelling out on it. Mood music for bad acid trippers, or maybe suicide bombers, ants, nanobots."
4,DK Books: Car,"Gave this to my 10 year old nephew, he loves it. Great pictures! Lots of information about the history of cars, how they work, how an engine works, even his Dad (who is a diesel mechanic) learned something."
4,Great Martial Arts Movie,"We reviewed One Armed Swordsman for our podcast Flying DVDs Of Death. While both my co-host Jeff and I enjoyed this movie, we did disagree a bit on just how good it is. Jeff maintains that this is a classic martial arts movie with great fights, interesting characters and a real story. While I agree, I feel that the movie had a few pacing and storyline issues (albeit minor ones) and that Wang Yu is essentially doing an impersonation of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti western characters. This also may be the first of the ""special weapon"" films featuring odd devices created for the movies.All in all, though, it is a worthy addition to any kung fu or action movie collection. The Dragon Dynasty edition is a beautiful version of the film, even if it is not HD, and features excellent English dubbing."
2,Did we all watch the same movie?,"I'm a huge martial arts fans. I purchased the One-Armed Swordsman after reading many of the great reviews on Amazon.com. Lo and behold, for me, it was a total flop. There were no real fight scenes. Cold molasses moves faster than the pace of this movie. There were no surprises. The storyline was sub-par, the few fight scenes were horrible. Amazon must have sent me the wrong movie; this one was a totally flop.Do yourself a favor, don't believe the hype of the four and five stars given to this movie. Watch Ip Man or Ong Bak 2 or True Legend-------fight scenes galore."
5,absolution,"One of cinema history's most tragic examples of a filmmaker who never lived up to his promise, Yanagimachi's ""Himatsuri"" is a burning, haunting experience. Combining obscure imagery and Shinto references along with odd, bold leaps in tone the director crafts a singular and astounding work illuminating the disasterous results of man's severing his ties with nature. Taking a true life inexplicable murder/suicide in a remote Japanese fishing community as its platform, Yanamiguchi creates a fusion of image, sound and montage (coupled with Toru Takemitsu's chillingly primal score) that shows a real mastery of film form. But ""Himatsuri"" is not just form without content: beneath it all lies a message that is still very relevant as society progresses forward towards its digital future. A bonified masterpiece, there's never been anything quite like it."
1,Mouth Care Essentials (4 Heads),The only one of the 4 heads that I can use is the interdental cleaner which I like very much. I just don't like to have to purchase the other three items along with the interdental cleaners. Could these be sold separately? Thanks
3,"Warning, Unregulated","If you need a power adapter that has to be exactly 6VDC, I would not purchase this one. This one measured 10.2VDC. I had to rewind the transformer in order to drop the output down to the appropriate level so the frequency would match on my project. I used to build transformers so I know how to do this but I would not recommend anyone who has no experience to even attempt this. I was able to get it to work but I had to do about 3 hours of work. If you do not require exact voltage and you have a constant current draw the draw down action of the circuit will lower the voltage to most likely an acceptable level."
1,An Apalling Matter,"This book is tedious, has little direction, and is badly written. Entitled ""An Explosive Matter"" the book briefly summarizes fuel tank explosions. Drawing facts from earlier aircraft accidents, the authors offer little analysis beyond `there was an empty fuel tank, a spark, and then an explosion - empty fuel tanks are hazardous'. After this `analysis', the authors go on to criticize recent advances in aviation such as ETOPS, and the reduced 2-pilot cockpit arrangement in more recent airliners. The two-sentence justifications made in support such criticisms are total garbage. The extensive use of capitals and exclamation marks do nothing to improve the appeal of the book which is plagued by frequent factual inaccuracies (e.g. KAL 007 being shot down in 1996, and the combined death toll of SR111 and TWA #800 being 659 deaths) and both spelling and grammatical errors; I still find it hard to believe that NTSB is spelt wrong over 5 times!"
5,What a Friend We Have in Jesus,"Not quite as gritty as Ashley Cleveland's other work, but if you like singing along to CDs, this will give your throat a real work-out. I hurt after a couple days of owning my copy, and even missed a turn while driving my library delivery route while belting out ""What a Friend We Have in Jesus"" --a duet with Ashley Cleveland, so to speak. She probably would have quit, had she heard me. If you like your rock with a good bluesy/countryish flavor, this hymn collection is for you."
2,God Is Closer Than You Think,"I believe I was mislead. I ordered the material. The description described that I would get the DVD, the Participant's guide and the hardcover book for the price of the item. When just the DVD arrived I felt disappointed."
4,Nice cold-war flick,"I wasn't alive during the era, so I don't really no what the nation was feeling at the time. But this movie does a good job of bringing the viewer into a tense, delicate atmosphere. Costner has an interesting part of being JFKs advisor...but of course he steals the picture away from the president...that makes sense, right? Because we all know it was the white house aides that saved the day. That, and the constant allusions to The Guns of August were the only things I disliked about the movie. I've owned it for a long time now, and I still watch it occasionally."
1,Thirteen Days,The copy of the DVD of Thirteen Days that I recieved was blank. It was useless. I was so mad I just threw it out. I doubt I'll ever do business with you again.
1,Bootleg cop??!,"When I tried to play this movie, I could not. The message said I was in the wrong ""region"". I had to choose ""region 2"" to play the video, which was not the US. I had to choose region 2 through Belgium. TThis looks like a bootleg copy to me. I asked for a new copy like I have purchased in the past. I want my money back!!!"
1,13 Days Film Budget Issues,The actual movie was a drag and some times in the film if you watch the top part of the screen you could see the microphones and the accent that one guy had was annoying. It needed more action to grab my attention.
1,Thirteen Days.long and boring.....,"Sadly I don't know what Kevin Costner was thinking. But I am not surprised Liberal Hollywood would make a movie Glorifying the Kennedy Camelot Myth and guess ? ....Make the Military look trigger happy as usual. And then if it's based on Kenny's ""View of Events"",Aldai Stevenson,etc.Basically anyone who served under that admin(any liberal admin for that Matter)then your reading Revisionist history to redeem Kennedy's Many MANY Faults. He was no Cold Warrior but a Softie.Half the books you read and movies you see sadly feed this and other big lies in history written by those who want to slant it their way,From Stalin/FDR To Jfk To LBJ and Vietnam to Bay of Pigs and probably to anything to the left for that matter you will always have Fallacies for stories. If your a Kennedyite or Lib maybe you will enjoy the movie,sure good acting,good fiction,but boston accents is the least troublesome of this propaganda film."
5,Accurate and thought provoking,"A nice reconstruction of the hectic days of autumn 1962, when the US and USSR reached the edge of the abyss of massive military confrontation due to the missiles in Cuba. The era is presented with accuracy and the desperate meetings of the US military and political leadership give a feeling of the extremely heavy burden that JFK had to shoulder. Thanks to his magnificent leadership and coolness (but also to his good advisers the movie suggests) the world avoided a nuclear war. It is a film from which world leaders of today should learn many valuable lessons on crisis management."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!,"Please stay away from this over-hyped, lopsided skewering of history. It's pure Hollywood. This movie claims that the real drama lies with presidential aid Kenneth O'Donnell (Kevin Costner, in yet another forgettable role) and his nurse-maiding of the Kennedy boys through the pifalls of Cold War diplomacy. I don't think so. Take a look instead at 1974's ""The Missiles of October,"" and watch William Devane (JFK) and Howard DaSilva (Kruschev) square off in a chilling chess match of nuclear proliferation. No hype. No distortion of facts. No cartoonish special effects to jar you back to consciousness from insipid dialogue, spoken blandly. Just good, accurate drama."
4,A really great film.,"I saw this film the week it premiered in theaters and I enjoyed it immediately. I had read books about the Cuban Missile Crisis and how Kennedy was under pressure from the Joint Chiefs to either invade Cuba or attack the missile sites. This film was well-presented. It explains how the Cuban Missile Crisis got started and how Kennedy ended the crisis without starting World War III with the Soviet Union. The film had a lot of action, suspense and drama which kept me entertained throughout the movie which I enjoyed. I also thought that the film had a great cast that gave convincing, effective performances. I don't think that this film was weak, depressing or boring at all. I really enjoyed the film and I think that it's worth going to see."
4,Good for teaching the suspense of the Cuban Missile Crisis!,"I found the movie to be very good and although there are some historical inaccuracies, the movie still portrayed the suspense of the situation."
1,"Direction, Costner's Accent the Real Disastah","Maybe I just can't stand Kevin Costner. But the favorable reviews for this movie really surprised me. The only emotion I felt through the film was embarrasment -- for Costner and his on-camera wife's attempt at Boston accents. The story is pretty good, but the mushroom cloud scenes and random black & white sequences seemed amateurish and out of place. The direction pales in comparison to ""Traffic,"" which uses similar techniques with actual purpose and effect. Also, the Costner-family storyline was about as hackneyed as it comes... if you've seen either of the two recent meteor movies you know what I'm talking about. One star for teaching history (even if it's not 100% accurate)... and hey, the JFK lookalike was fun."
4,Season 1 rating,I definitely got a new show to watch. I love how they mix the characters with serious and humorous attitudes. Makes the show more fun to watch.
3,Good but not great,"Whilst LJ Smith's books are a good read, I do get narked with the characters sometimes. Most of the lead characters are too nice and any 'bad' characters are always gothy and into heavy metal. Goodie is sickly sweet and oh so nice blonde, baddie is hot but very nasty brunette (see how easy it is to follow the plot read the secret circle if you don't believe me) But back to this, this had a great starting point, but lost the plot slighty. LJS seemed to be really hitting us on the head with how 'bad' Gabriel was and how nice everyone else was, and of course the main female is so understanding and desired by all. Liked it but not as much as the Forbidden Game."
4,Good book!,I really enjoyed reading dark visions! I loved Gabriel! I wish the ending had a bit more to it.. It ended the way I wanted it to but it didn't elaborate on what happened to all the characters after.. All in all good book go read it! :)
4,5ive Days to Midnight,"Hi! This is another one of those TV movies that slipped under the radar. I didn't know about it until a friend told me of it. The story is intersting with those wonderful sci-fi twists. While not a true time travel tale where characters go on the trip, the storyline does have intrigue. Other reviewers have covered the plot well enough. I just want to let you who love ""time"" stories know you should give this one a chance. Ain't earth shattering or precedent setting, but is a fun watch. Enjoy! }:o)"
5,Better than expected,"Timothy Hutton's performance makes this miniseries. For a time travel movie, the plot was plausible with few logic disconnects. Value for the money."
3,Good not great.,"The picture does not equate with the reality. The book is an Easton Press volume which is much lighter in color than the picture. Book is okay. Shipping was fine from company that sold it, and the condition of the book as described was accurate. But had I seen an accurate picture of what the book looks like vis a vis coloring, I wouldn't have bought it."
5,For the Wife,My wife teaches ballroom dance in China and she really likes this set of combinations. I see her working this at least once a week.
5,this book is well written,Learn what it's like on the rez.written well with humor and feeling. Received book quickly.
2,Weight loss gimmick!,"When I read the ingredients in the slenderizing cream, I did my homework. While this product might be great for smoothing & toning skin, it is NOT intended for weight loss...especially those of us who need to lose more than a few inches. I followed the instructions exactly as indicated in the booklet provided & lost 0 inches! Rubbing a clay and oil mix followed by using wraps to compress your skin has nothing to do with removing waste surrounding your cells. It's simple biology; only your liver & blood have the ability to perform that process. Only diet & exercise helps you lose those unwanted inches ladies! Do not waste your money! Trust me, if you want to spend $100 on body wraps, go to a spa! Than at least you don't have to do the work!"
5,A great novel by a great woman,"Some may say that I am biased because the author is a relative, but that is not the case. Ruth Miriam Garnett is a great author who made the women in this book really come to life. When reading this book, you will likely come across a character that reminds you of someone you know."
4,A good book on Evaluation,This book covers a lot of different evaluation topics and is a great book for someone new to the topic or as a reference book for people experienced in evaluation. I wish they'd included more on how to calculate certain formulas in excel.
4,A lush synthpop gem,"Chris Ianuzzi's solo debut recalls many turn-of-the'-80s influences, but not the ones that have been done to death these last few years. Instead of dry, primitivist electro, he's created polished, cerebral singer/songwriter synthpop a la Thomas Dolby. His gritty voice -- edged with the rasp of Peter Gabriel and the wail of David Byrne -- guides you through the dense, burbling production, telling stories of sci-fi romance and danger."
3,Ok,These are ok. I didnt realize that they were made out of wood which is probaly the only negative. Someone said they were short I think they are actually long for sit down shooting sticks but could easily be shortned if needed.
1,A sickening excuse for an action movie,"About 20 minutes into this film, you will wonder if it has any intention of slowing down from the continuous chase scene. Then it does and you realize how bad it gets without the action. You want to stick your leg over from the passenger seat and step on the accelerator yourself.Perhaps the highest praise I can muster for this film is how carefully it metered it's sucking while providing a wide variety to the sucking."
3,WHY IT HAD TO BE LOW BUDGET!!!!???? WHY!!!!!!??????,"This movie had the chance of being perfect but they WASTE IT!!!!!I only gave it 3 stars because is an anime tribute, is action-packed and the action scenes were SOO COOOOL!!! (best action scenes since Equilibrium) BUT:* CG animation and special effects were SOO CHEAP!!!* The destructions and gun fightings looked SOO FAKE!!!!* The movie itself is SOO LIGHTY that you can hardly see it.* The settings, cars and stufs of the movie are pure CG graphics and they were VERY UNREALISTIC.Ultraviolet could have been the next Matrix or something if only had a better quality.P.S: I saw Guyver 2 (low budget anime tribute movie) and it was MUCH BETTER than this one.Adios."
2,I think I missed something,"Well, I went into this movie expecting nothing more than a silly action movie, however I came out with some very important life lessons.1. When ever surrounded by a circle of enemies, up to 700, ducking and spinning will cause them to all shoot and/or stab each other.2. If the end of a movie is lacking in luster or tension, simply turn off the lights and light your sword on fire. This will immediately cancel out any previous flaws in the movie.3. If you look good naked in the beginning of the movie, there is no need to act for the rest of the film.4. You know that it is a quality film when it takes almost half of the movie for you to figure out that the main characters are vampires, as evidenced by showing their protruding fangs a lot.Hope this helps you make up your mind about this movie. Was this based on a comic book or something? I got the feeling that there was a whole bunch of back story that I was missing."
1,"Boring, Bad acting and Storyline!!","The only redeeming feature of this flick are the special effects and costuming!The rest of this movie sucked. The acting was bad, monotone, and one dimensional..... No depth of character.The fight scenes were badly choreographed, phony looking and fake. Too many of the fight scenes in ""Ultraviolet"" were poorly reminscent of ""The Matrix"" and ""Aeon Flux"", and made this movie feel like a shoddy imitation in comparison. Both ""The Matrix"" and ""Aeon Flux"" were far superior movies in in terms of plot, acting, special effects, fight sequences and more.Ending of this movie wasn't great either, nor very creative. Found it difficult to want to watch this movie through it's end result.Don't waste money or time renting or buying this movies!"
1,Ultracrap,"Every now and then the critics get one right. Ultraviolet is not a movie, but merely an excuse for a lot of CGI effects. What plot there is is so convoluted when you unpack it you won't care because it's contrived and unoriginal. The acting is terrible. Then again, the only thing worse is the dialog the actors are forced to say. All fight scenes in movies are choreographed but the good ones are seamless so you can't tell. The fight scenes in Ultraviolet are a ballet with every move telegraphed so you never believe any of it for a second. I'm sure a lot of money was wasted making this film as was the money I spent to watch it. If you want to watch Milla Jovovich rent The Fifth Element or The Messenger."
1,OH MY GOD !!!,THIS WAS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!! I WENT TO SEE IT AT THE MOVIES AND I COULDN'T TAKE IT AFTER THE FIRST HALF HOUR!!! IT IS BADDD ...IT IS NOT EVEN WORTH TRYING TO SEE IT...
1,Ultraviolet,"This is a great old movie (Sci Fi) However, I do not own it.If in fact I did purchase it, I never received it."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Slightly redeemed only by the fact that the director's tongue is in his cheek for most of the movie (I hope), Ultraviolet is a thoroughly unimpressive sci-fi action movie with an uninteresting performance by Jovovich in the lead and no real story to speak of: look elsewhere."
3,Amazing Blu-Ray transfer....really bad movie,"Not much more to say, the video (best PQ I've seen on Blu-Ray so far), audio (uncompressed PCM 5.1) and some cool menus make this a great disc to show off the capabilities of Blu-Ray but the movie is really, really bad.5 Stars for the transfer, 1 star for the actual movie."
1,Ultra-Bad!,"This film was astounding....ly bad. In the list of things that might make a film good, this film had non.Dialog - laughablePlot - undeterminablePhotography - abysmal, the director could not make up his mind whether to soft-focus Milla or give her an ultra-gleam.The violence in this was so repetitive that I almost fell asleep.Do yourself a favor, if you want Matrix style chop-sockey, rent the Matrix, and view the original thing.In a nutshell - YUCK!"
2,BEAUTIFUL MOVIE THAT NEEDED A PLOT,"It is a shame that this movie wasn't great. It is a beautifully directed movie. It has characters that are good in their roles and create depth with little to work with. It has some incredible action sequences. Milla Jovovich may be the most believable actress in an action role along side Carrie Anne Moss. She looks athletic, like she can fight and she is a good actress. The character of Ultraviolet is such a cool character that this movie should have told itself. However, the plot is so bad that it makes you not care about any of these other factors as you watch this movie. The plot is not easy to follow, and once you do follow it the motives behind the characters in their actions make litle sense. Rent it, don't buy it."
2,"Good Action Movie, but thats all",CONTAINS SPOLIERS.This movie had alot of action which is good. But thats all that wuz good about this movie. This movie made no sense. It had no main point because it wuz starting 2 to make one but it just threw off into another path. It didnt explain how violet survived being shot. they said that she had to go through 3 hours of surgery. and plus shes a vampire and she got shot IN THE HEART. if a vampire gets hit by anything in the heart then its not gonna live. This movie wuz too long as well. It could have been 45 mins and still would have been horrible. Do see this movie if you were a fan of the comic books but if not wait to rent it.
2,Ultraviolet is off the spectrum.,"This movie has excellent cgi, excellent fight sequences, and excellent actors. Unfortunately, it doesn't have an excellent script. The dialogue and story were clunky at best and the movie had difficulty in its continuity. Was it the script or was it the editing? I don't know but this movie proved that you can't just throw money at something and expect it to be good. Sorry Mila. I've loved you in everything else that I've seen you in but this one was UltraBLEEP."
3,Good Movie,This was a great original idea. Plenty of good fight scenes. Plus Milla Jovovich is very easy on the eyes.
5,Ultraviolet Ultra-fabulous Action,Love this flick! Great Action! Great Hair! Love the fight scenes!!!
1,Complete waste of time,"This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. I didn't care anything about any of the characters, and the special effects were laughably bad. Even Milla didn't look that hot in this movie as her previous ones, but she was still the only reason to see this waste of time. ""What are you mental?"" Blah!"
1,"Good Transfer, Who Cares?","This is easily one of the worst movies I've ever been unforsightful enough to endure. Why does it matter if it is a perfect transfer or not? If they had a ferfect Blu-Ray transfer in glorious 1080p of a pile of crap, would that warrant 4 stars? I hope not. Well, it is the same situation here, unfortunately. Do yourself a favor, don't waste your time with this embarrassment of cinema."
2,Can't recommend,Not an easy read. The style of the writing didn't flow well. And the type was incredibly small.
4,The Original Warren Barfield,"Not as good as the followup CD, Reach, but still a great title from Warren Barfield. Any fan of his later work should appreciate this collection as well. ""Beautiful Broken World"" and ""10 Hours"" are both amazing songs, probably the 2 standouts on the album. If for no other reason, this CD is worthy for those 2 tracks. If you're not sure about this CD, pick up a copy of Barfield's ""Reach"" instead."
4,"Great writer, great story","I bought this book on Kindle a few weeks ago but just recently decided to read it. It didn't sound appealing from some of the reviews. I thought it would be to heavy (emotionally) and felt I needed to be ready for such a story. Boy, was I wrong. This is a really well-done book; great writing in the first person and a compelling two-in-one love story that gives you a really complete, multidimensional sense of the main character. This is a talented writer. If I had to be critical, there are two things I would point out that could have made the book a little better. I thought the character development of the other two characters (the love interests) suffered and was not nearly as fleshed out as the main character. Second, the book ended way too abruptly. This latter critique is, unfortunately, somewhat typical for the genre. Nevertheless, it would have been nice to take us a little beyond the happy-ever-after ending."
2,Mush Cords in a Big Barrel,"I have Baez's first album. It has been played over and over on a dozen machines over 40 years. You can imagine what it sounds like now. And, that is what ""Dark Chord on a Big Guitar"" sounds like. Absolutely wonderful songs, great voice and the worst recording since Big Brother and the Holding Company's first album. I hope Koch can re-engineer a fix. Its too good an album to lay there unheard."
4,tres bon livre pour modèle injection,"Ce livre est très claire et précis, le seul point qui ma déu c'est qu'il parle seulement des modèles injection. Mais pour le reste pas un mots a dire, j'ai adoré."
3,So-so,"This CD starts out promising. The first 5 songs are perfect for a long drive (the true test of a CD), but after that all the promise fades. Somehow McNally completely changes gear from mellow, smooth and groovy to laborious and odd. Bolder than Paradise and Bury my Heart try to re-capture the early groove, but sound a little too Sheryl Crowe ...[like]. In summary, if you can get through a couple downer songs like Could've been me or the weirdness of Jukebox Sparrows and enjoy a Sheryl Crowe-like imitation, you'll probably like this disc."
