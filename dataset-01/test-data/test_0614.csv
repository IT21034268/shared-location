3,There are nicer handles,"I have been using this for a month and it does everything it is suppose to do and seems well made. However, I was replacing one I had left at a relatives house and this one is not as nice as the one I used to own. I prefer a padded handle for more comfort and less slipping (I have large hands and it is much more comfortable for me to have the larger, padded handle). I should have looked closer at this one, my fault, but just letting others know that if it matters to you, the handle on this one is hard, cold plastic and without the pad is not as easy for me to grip. For the price, I was expecting the nicer grip."
3,An average product,"Unless you are very weak or just started to work out, don't buy this. It is very light. Not that this company is bad, it just have very light resistance bands. You should try the purple bands because they are pretty good"
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"I have to give this product 3 stars. It does not seem very strong from tubing to the handles, and I'll be surprised if it lasts long. Granted, it is the light weight (yellow) band, but I have several others weights from SPRI Xertube that just appear to be made from better materials. I do appreciate the door attachment."
4,Not bad for the Price,I got the band and it does what is says! The tension was good for my level of strength and I am able to get a good workout from them. I would highly recommend this product!
4,Great,This was shipped VERY fast! I got it within a few days of ordering it! It works well - I bought it to use with P90X and it is working out well.
3,Medium Exercise Tube with Door Attachment,"Haven't used the door attachment. Use tube with video exercise, great for upper body toning."
2,"Fine band, but bad for Wii Active use","Trying to use this as a replacement for Wii Active, and unless you have HUGE hands the handles are too big to hold both the bands and the Wii remotes. I'm a 6' guy so it's not like I don't have decently large hands to hold everything, but I keep getting errors trying to do the exercises.I'm going to try another flat band instead, similar to the one that came w/ the game originally.For anyone using it for it's ""normal"" use, this should be fine. Seems to be of good quality."
4,Good for the extra workout,"I would classify myself as a weekend warrior. I play ball with the friends, mountain bike, go hiking, etc. I mainly use this resistance band to help stretch and do low resistance workouts to get rid of the soreness. Overall it helps me get back into the game quickly.Nate"
5,Just like having regular weights!,"This is a perfect item if you don't have enough space to have a weights set, it makes everything work as good and hard as having weights... Bigger loops, the heavier it gets!! Perfect!!"
2,not at all very heavy,"I really find this band too weak, and I'm not a regular weight builder. On the ground I can loop it and step on it, but with the door attachment, I have to stand 10 feet away to even start to feel resistance. Can anyone recommend a good stronger band?"
5,"Xertube (Green, light)",Great product. Easy to use and lightweight. Great to pack into a suitcase - no reason not to exercise! I love it.
1,Terrible handles,"SPRI yellow xertubes come with either rigid or flexible handles per the SPRI website, with the rigid ones being provided unless the flexible ones are explicitly ordered.So,I ordered a set from Amazon, and what came was a yellow xertube with flexible handles. I complained that I did not want the flexible handles, and Amazon sent out a replacement without checking. The replacement had the same horrible flexible handles.Amazon needs to state on each of their four websites for SPRI yellow xertubes whether the handles are rigid or flexible. And then they need to provide what they state they are providing.Both sets have been returned to Amazon"
4,"Good, but...","This is a nice set of resistance bands. I don't know if it's just me but for th second most resistant bands of the lot (purple ones offer more resistance) I was expecting a bit more.They are good, but not enough for me. I'm around 5'11"", so you can't say I'm short, and for me it would have been better if it were a little tighter. There is obviously a work around this, by using both handles on one arm at a time and switch to the other after, just increases exercise time.The small exercise guide is nice, but it would be nicer with detail showing of the muscle group (not just the name) worked. I guess that's a bit personal.All in all it seems well built door attachment is great, plus you can just adjust the height of your arms and work different muscles.Even though I would of liked a bit more I'm sure this will do the job for a lot of people."
2,"A bit too many ""exercises""","While this book has some great ideas, it basically takes 40+ pages of repetitive information to get to the basics. This book is targeted more at those individuals who would like to have long discussions or memory sharing activities with family members. Text includes several discussion topics with specific questions on learning more about your family memories including topics that maybe you didn't think to ask about. Good for ""generation sharing"". If you just want to get some ideas on how to distribute items or how to ""value"" sentimental items, you will likely only take 10-15 minutes to browse the text."
4,a nice book for teen girls,"I read this book because I love mysteries, and I love books set in various periods of England. I was able to predict who the murderer was, even though I am usually unsuccessful at doing so in the many murder mysteries I read. But I decided that was to be expected in a book geared toward a younger audience. I enjoyed the diary format and the relationship that she had with the queen. One reviewer wrote that the relationship seems unrealistic, but even if it is, it IS a fiction book, after all. I certainly recommend this book to young ladies."
5,its just a great scent women love it and it never gets old ....,"its just a good scent you defenetly get your moneys worth ...the bottle i received was well packaged on time fast delivery and it was the real thing nothing like the waterdown versions you might receive somewere eles , overall good product ..."
1,parece que no es original,la colonia que compre el olor no dura nada parece que fuera imitación por favor quiero solución y mi dineroThe colony that buys the smell does not last nothing seems that it was an imitation please I want solution and my money
3,anyone own this pair of shoes yet?,"Hello fellow shoppers,The shoes look really cute but for $100? Hm...Does anyone know about the comfort of these shoes? I've never heard of this brand before.If anyone has any experience with these shoes, please let us know.Thanks in advance!"
2,"Fun, but I'd only recommend to beginners.","I bought this as a beginner, and because of that I think it's a lot of fun. That being said, don't buy this if you're expecting a fabulous instrument. If you're just starting out and not willing to pay a lot of money for a better instrument, I recommend it, but be aware that it may have some problems. There is glue visible on mine, for one. It also feels like it is made out of pretty cheap materials. The thing that bothers me the most, though, is that I cannot get it to stay in tune. I have to tune it way more often than I should have to. I am unsure if this is a problem with the tuning pegs or if it's a problem with the strings, but it's a complete pain either way. Next time I buy a uke, I plan on spending a little more for something of better quality."
5,love this,I love this cd it is one of the most romantic cds i have ever purchased.The seller shipped it on time and it all was packaged neatly.
5,Delicious low cal treat,"Baxters soups are usually very nice, but the lobster bisque is especially good. It tastes authentic, it has a good flavour, is creamy, and has just enough lobster bits to make it interesting. Add some fresh black pepper and a dash of brandy or sherry and it rivals soup served in a very good restaurant.It's also surprisingly low calorie. Though the nutrition info here says 130 calories for 8oz, the label actually says 120 calories, so even if you ate the whole can for lunch you would consume only about 220 calories."
2,Navman Pin100 forget it,"I have a Navman Pin 100 and the latest software SmartST 2005 and it still sucks as a GPS unit. The new software offers very little if any improvement over the old. The Tech support is poor also, they know the problems but can't offer any real solutions for you. I put my address in and it told me that there was not enought info. Would not recommend this unit to anyone looking for a GPS solution. If they would improve the address location there may be some hope for the thing. Battery life isn't very good either. I've tryed putting address in every way possible and it is still a crap shoot."
5,A new comer to pilates,"This is the first book I have bought on the Pilates method - and it was a good choice. Emily Kelly covers both pilates techniques as well as practical advice on how to make pilates part of your life - and your exercise schedule. The phtographs and instructions are very clear and the feature I like best is the diagram of the muscle groups being worked with each exercise. Emily then puts everything together by giving her readers two sample programmes to work through - a long session and a short one. There are also exercises one can do at the office and as a warm up for aerobic forms of exercise. I thoroughly reccomend this book as one which delivers what ir promsises... a common sense approach to exercise and healthy living.... Emily, when is your second book coming out??"
1,Unfortunately not well built,"I got this item for Christmas and was extremely pleased with it for the first day or so. However, after 3 or 4 movies, it acts up now and will not finish a movie. If it does manage to start the movie (which is increasingly rare) it may get through 5 minutes or 30 minutes, but it will freeze up and you simply have to turn off the machine.The picture and sound quality are beyond what I was expecting, and the size is great for toting around. I am about to go out of the country for 6 months and was looking forward to taking this with. Unfortunately, it didn't last beyond 6 hours let alone 6 months. I will take it back and try another, but I am not getting my hopes up after seeing the problems others had with the durability of the player.If the next one I get works like it is supposed to, I would give it 5 stars without hesitation....IF it works."
3,Does the job,I bought this to have something a little more advanced than a self test model. This works well for what I needed it for. It is easy to read and the book is helpful. I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars for a professional caliper that I am using on cliens only few times a month. Worth the money.
5,A must-have tool !,Its the best skinfold caliper ever created .....all i can say it >accumeasure caliper big time!You dont need to worry about pressing the right fold anymore ...slim guide caliper works like auto pilot once u learn where the right places to take the measure from....it takes lil practice but it worth having it if u wanna gain lean mass or tracking ur fat loss on a weekly basis.
5,This is a great movie!,"If you are a music fan or a father this movie is for you. This movie is all about the family unit, fatherhood and responsibilities. Some language issues but nothing your kid hasnt heard before.I highly recommend this movie if you are between the ages of 30 and 50."
4,"Nice, relaxing","Good pregnancy workout! I can feel that I've worked my muscles after doing this and it keeps me flexible. I like that Desi is actually pregnant. Some if the stretches are too hard on my body and I wish she gave modifications, besides child's pose."
3,just ok,"I rented this based on the good reviews. I have to say, although it was a decent enough video, I was fairly bored. I suppose that's because I'm only doing yoga right now because my doctor recommended it for my pregnancy. I usually do Zumba, so this is a major change in pace. I've done yoga before and wasn't as bored as I was with this one, so I don't think it's because I'm a complete novice and don't know what to expect. That being said, I just finished the video and I feel very relaxed and thoroughly stretched out. If your goal is to get some relaxation and stretch sore muscles, then I would recommend it. I just don't think I'll be buying the video to use every day..."
2,Sad,"I was disappointed in this book. Although Mr. Innes' elegant use of language is as good as ever, the book is too much the maunderings of an old man. It made me sad. If you're an autobiography nut it may appeal to you more."
1,"Right minded, but dated information and not detailed enough.",In my search for instructional material on how to get the most from fasting I grabbed this titled as at first glance it looked like a quick read and to the point. Upon reading it I was disappointed as it seems that it was written for a much earlier and unenlightened audience (1930's) when little may have been know about dietary practices. Most of the text is spent on promting the benefits of fasting and specificially Prof. Ehret's approach. Guidance on fasting itself is not very in-depth.Marcus Abundis
5,a little book of hugs for sisters,This book will touch the hearts of all sisters at any age. I gave it to my sister with a note of love on the title page. The book is especially precious to me as the little girls on the cover are my granddaughters. They are ages 3 and 5 while my sister and I are 55 and 62 and although the years pass and our faces have changed....the love in our heart and the bond between us will endure forever.
1,"Wooden characters, simplistic plot","This novel was surprisingly and disappointingly bad. [...] These characters were wooden and stilted, and never came to life as real people talking in real dialogue. Everyone came across as fairly idiotic, frankly. If you want to read a good legal thriller, try anything by Steve Martini. Don't waste your time with this."
2,Disappointing.,"I truly looked forward to reading this book .... good reviews, interesting plot,- murder of a judge in Washington D.C., the inner workings of the second highest court in the U.S., scandal, corruption & conspiracy, balance of power, the Oval Office, ... well I think you get the point. The story outline is truly inspiring - unfortunately the characters, their dialog and the story line itself falls short. The ending, resolution and point of the story, (at least what I could glean), was - hey - guess what - A SEQUEL! Previous reviews aside - didn't like this one."
1,Short lifespan,I got several hours of use from my player before the screen went black. I tried to revive the system for several more hours and gave it up for dead. Very disappointing.
1,2 Bad experiences,"I bought one unit and was very happy with it for a while. The power cord was flimsily attached and eventually required holding it just so to get the movies to play. Even with that, it would cut out for no reason, so back it went. I paid the $50. repair fee (the three month parts and labor warrantee was over).I just got the new unit (or probably refurb) two days ago. I had one happy day then the unit went black. It plays the DVD, because you can hear it, but the screen is too dim to see. I believe that this had been an infrequent problem on my first unit. Back this unit goes. The technician was friendly and Initial is paying the shipping this time, but I have to wait another 4 weeks, and hope that I don't have problems again.Yes this is a good price for a portable DVD, but I wish I had paid more and gotten better quality. No matter how little money you pay, you might be wasting it."
1,PLEASE DO NOT BUY,"I'm only giving this piece of junk 1 star because the rating scale is from 1 to 5. I wish I could give it a -10 !!!!Unfortunately I did not read all the reviews of this product. I was in a hurry to buy a portable DVD player and saw the screen size for the price. BAD move. I too have the problem with the black screen. I was at home watching a DVD on battery when it flashed the ""low battery"" warning. So I plugged in the adapter. The screen went black! I tried removing the battery and running on adapter. BLACK SCREEN! I tried replacing the battery and having the adapter plugged in. BLACK SCREEN! I charged the battery and removed the adapter. Tried running on battery. BLACK SCREEN! I guess I'm now stuck with a $300 paper weight!DO NOT.......I REPEAT..........DO NOT BUY THIS DVD PLAYER!!!!!!!!I wish I hadn't!"
3,No fast forward on the unit,"I have tried to find a portable DVD with a fast forward on the unit, to no avail. I don't want to carry a remote with me to simply fast forward. Typical scenario: Watch DVD in terminal, board plane and shut off DVD player, plane takes off, turn on DVD player, wait up to 15 minutes!!! for the scene to catch up to where you left off (invariably you have left off right near the end of a chapter). Repeat when the plane is landing, repeat on your next connection, repeat when you arrive at your destination.I called the manufacturer and they said that fast forward is being removed by all portable DVD manufacturers because people got upset when they confused the FF with chapter skip. Come on, we all have to suffer because of stupid people? How does putting it on the remote help the stupid people?Harold Roberts"
2,This one needs a rewrite.,I've purchased other Magic Lantern Guides in the past have been satisfied with their content. The Nikon F5 guide falls short of the mark - I would guess the author was pushed to get it written quickly and didn't have time to go into any great detail about the controls. The book needs a rewrite to cover in IN DETAIL all of the controls and the reasons why you might choose one over the other. The book should also expand it's coverage of the Nikon Photo Secretary Software. Considering the cost of my F5 I would GLADLY pay 3 times as much money for an F5 guide with the kind of detail I've suggested.
3,"Worth reading, but not indispensable.","For a book that supposedly covers the F5 it spends too much time, (approx 50% of the book), talking about other Nikon equipment. If you buy an F5 I assume that you know there are bellows units and data backs etc. available for the camera. Can't help but feel that here large chunks of the previous Nikon F4/F4s manual were used. More impressed with Mr Peterson's web site than I am with this version of his book."
1,A Book not worthy of the Camera,"If your looking for in depth coverage on the F5 give this book a miss. The users manual covers all that is in it, and even that which it covers in not clear. I bought the book looking for deeper answers and descriptions of this great camera and was sorely disappointed in what I found. It seemed more of a general description of the camera and Nikon products, almost a sales book for Nikon!! I wish someone would write something worthy of this greatest of cameras."
1,Worst Guide Ever,"This book is nothing but a cut and paste of the Nikon F5 Manual. Don't waste your money. If you did not have the manual, you can order it from NIKON for must less."
2,better to read the manual than spend time on the book.,"author is pushy to write this book and no new news compared with the old F4 series. it is better to read the manufacturer's manual (cost only 10 u.s. bucks) than spend time on this appears F5 manual, lot of new F5 features are not covered. Also peterson's web site is very helpful."
4,The FIRST BOOK ABOUT THE PLAYERS AS PEOPLE IN THE NFL.,"This book is fantastic. It is not just a book about football. It is a story of people. You don't have to be a Satints fan or football fanatic to love this book. My wife and 15 year old non-football fan daughter truly enjoyed this book. If you love stories about people and real life, this is the book for you. I was actually a fan in attendance at most of the events in the book and the skillfull story telling had me back there reliving those wonderfull moments. Great Job!!!!!"
5,"Tough, stylish, and practical.","This is the coolest computer carrying case I've seen. I am glad I bought it. One of my favorite features is the three ways to carry it. This bag can be carried over the shoulder, on the back, or with one hand. Also, it is very comfortable to carry; the straps are wide and cushioned. The other great feature is the organized and spacious compartments that hold (besides the computer and peripherals), files, disks, pens, keys, cell phone, and plane tickets for easy access (a must when traveling). However, don't let the stylish look fool you. This bag is tough. The materials are high quality. If you are looking for a versatile computer case for traveling, buy this one."
5,Revolution by Simplicity!,"Einstein once lamented that his work ""changed everything but the way we think."" If you are attached to a dog-eat-dog existence, and change is just too...bothersome, Metapatterns is probably not for you. Science is rapidly changing, and Dr. Tyler Volk generously invites us all to be in on it. If you would like some cobwebs tenderly removed, and would like a window on the new disciplines being born and old ones coming alive, just sit back and watch this guy go. With a flood of vivid images, taken from mainstream culture, everyday life, essential Science laid bare, the banquet shared of one man's experience, Tyler Volk empties by filling. If you believe that meaningful relatedness is essential, read this book. You will learn lots of nourishing stuff and it won't even hurt."
5,Enjoyed It,"There were probably things that could have been done better. The movie got pretty long at the end, kept thinking that was it but there was still more, and to be honest the more wasn't really that special. But the scenery, music and acting were all quite good. The story was okay. The fact that it was long really wasn't bad because it is one of those epic type movies that tells a whole story, in this case about a man named Arn, and not just a great victory he had. This was much better than expected and both myself and my teenage son really enjoyed it."
2,so close...yet so far away.,This movie is filmed rather well with a good story line. The problem is that it fails when it comes to a making well connected scenes. It leaves so much unsaid that it fails to make it clear as to what is going on. The conversation between Arn and the opposing king is so comical I had to laugh. It wasn't meant to be funny. I think they tried to make a great movie and just couldn't do it. It was a valiant try. It also has many subtitles as the English is only spoken some of the time. It was not what I hoped it would be.
2,Save Your Money,"I enjoy good historical films on most any topic, particularly one which promises adventure. I purchased Arn, based on some of the reviews in this section.I was very much disappointed. The film is poorly edited and rather tedious. It looks and plays out much for what it is, a television production (although many made for tv films can be excellent).Anyone interested in the Crusades period would be well advised to buy or rent Kingdom of Heaven which is immensely entertaining and very well done.Arn, on the other hand, looks like a budget film, and its story could be told in half the time.Best performance in the Mother Abbess--the onkly good thing to look for in this film.Like I say, save your money--Arn is not worth buying. I would never watch it again, so it will collect dust in my dvd library.One very excellent historical film made in 2010 is worth mentioning--Agora---by all means watch or buy that one, not Arn."
5,Perfect fit for HP Pavilion ze5300,"I have an HP Pavilion ze5385us (ze5300 series) and this thing fits my laptop perfectly. The front pocket can fit the power supply, an infrared mouse, an infrared transmitter, and a headphone just fine. There is another large pocket inside that I use to store my CDROMs (it can hold up to 8 CDROM covers). Another inside raised pocket is large enough to hold my box of business cards and a 100-tablet migraine-heache bottle. The back-side pocket is slimmer but is big enough to hold my composition notebook & a newspaper. It's perfect for my needs and it looks quite decent. I would highly recommend it."
4,it truly is a good buy,"when i saw the 2 glowing reviews for this product i was skeptical but i proceeded to purchase it out of necessity. i must say that this bag is an excellent buy. the price is fantastic and the actual bag is worth the money. it is large enough to just fit my sony vaio pcg-430. the inside is padded and there is a compartment in which physical files and documents can be placed and useful zipper pockets in which other paraphanalia can be placed. once closed, the bag is sleek and actually a good-looking accessory for the traveller. i gave it 4 out of 5 stars only because it is a working-class accessory and obviously the higher end carrying cases would prove to be more industrious, elegant, and fun to own."
3,"Fine for light use, thicker laptops","This case looks nice and has plenty of pockets for all the other stuff you have to carry around. But, if you're using it for something other than back and forth to the office or have a thinner laptop, there is just not enough padding in here to protect the computer from scratching and rubbing. We bought this for my son for school this past Fall. He has one of those thinner laptops and the cover was soon dented and scratched and the constant rubbing of the screen on the touchpad controls left little white marks on the display. While you can blame the computer design some, after we added more padding in the case, we had no more problems. On the plus side, the case is durable - nothing has yet ripped or torn off - and it's easy to spot clean."
3,Don't be fooled,"This is a great song and I got it for my friend who is a BT fanatic. He loves this type of trance, stuff like ATB and other melody driven stuff. And I got this thinking it was going to have the original mix on it, but it doesn't. It has a Timo Mass mix which is house and a Hybrid mix which is break beat (the better of the two mixes, but only half of it is good.) So just be careful when ordering, as you may not get all that you expected. Big up to all the Garage Massive world wide.And if anyone has a copy of 3d Crew ""Forget about Dre."" Please hook a brother up!!"
4,Too little,"I used to LOVE the classic Shalom Sesame, so I was excited to buy this for my friend's 2-year-old. The kid stared raptly at the TV, so from her perspective it was probably very good, but I was underwhelmed.- Several filler sketches (repeats from other episodes) with no connection to Israel, Hebrew, Judaism, or any of the Rechov Sumsum cast- The entire DVD has only one 20-min episode (my friend said: ""I hope you didn't spend too much on this."" I didn't, but still.)- It was a fairly soft intro to 'Shalom', falafel, counting, and not much else.- Fairly long intro adI'll probably still try to get the others at some point, but maybe I'll rent or borrow them instead of buying each episode separately."
3,Great little massager,I've always wanted one of these. It feels great on my head for about 5 mins but after that the novelty of the sensation is gone and it's not as pleasurable. But I'm still glad I bought it since it feels good for that first few mins. Not bad for the price.
2,Not the greates,"I wish I could say this is a great product, but it isn't. It scratches your head, but has very very sharp edges at the end of the copper prongs. It hurts on the way up and is not comfortable."
1,"Wires loose their shape, sharp edges that can cut skin","Wires loose their shape, sharp edges that can cut skin, copper wire always need adjustments"
2,Tingler knockoff isn't quite as tingly!,"What's the deal with the rough-hewn copper balls on the end of the copper wires? They are scratchy. The ends of the Tingler are lacquer-dipped and sliiiiiiiide through your hair.I knew I should've gone with the Tingler, but I thought, how different can two head massagers be? Apparently, pretty different.Oh, here's a simple trick to determine whether you would like a head massager. Are you one of those people who loves having their hair played with? You will love having a (properly constructed) head massager. If not, don't bother leaving a bad review, because we told you you wouldn't like it..."
3,scalp massauger,"The massauger works as I want it to, but the direct scratchy contact of the copper or whatever alloy of metal the finger like thin rods are, Iwish that they had (plastic tips) like the first one that I bought 2 or3 years ago at the Natural Foods store in my town."
1,Don't waste your money!,Piece of junk. This product is so poorly constructed I consider it completely defective and hazardous to use.
1,not worth the money,not even worth returning. i will end up loosing money to return it. hurt my head. will work great as a lettuce holder.
2,Not a good buy,"Though this is a very inexpensive item, the ends on this thing are sharp, and will gouge the hell out of your scalp. I recommend getting something else."
2,"Ouch, this hurts!","it may just have been me and not knowing how to use this but I found that this was not a relaxing experience. The massager came compacted and you have to manually seperate each metal arm, and then when I tried to use this it jabbed into my head. I tried adjusting the arms a little and it still was very uncomfortable. I would, and do stay away from this now. Not the best purchase I have ever made."
2,Pretty basic...,"The yoga asanas Shiva Rea uses here are pretty basic and can be found through just about any DVD or local yoga studio hour-long practice. The yoga part of this is nothing special in my opinion. However, the DVD is superior in that you can tailor your yoga workout/practice with a special menu where you point-click ala carte style, choosing between several different flows, to build your own custom practice. This is a great concept for differing requirements.I'm giving this two stars, however, because every time I try to turn off the music it crashes my laptop and I've had to restart the whole thing. This happens on both my Mac and my roommates PC."
1,Received wrong book,"This is just a fair warning to anyone interested in buying this edition: The copy I received looked normal (it had the right cover) but after opening it up I found that the text inside was the book ""The Hunger But Mostly Death Games""Another person has posted a review describing the same problem. I ended up having to spend $3 to return the book to Amazon because they only supply a portion of the return shipping, I was very annoyed by this and I highly suggest not buying the mass-market edition if you decide on this translation.In addition to this, I highly recommend getting a copy translated by Sverre Lyngstad, which just came out in 1996. I browsed through both copies (Sverre & Egerton) and the difference in how the prose is rendered is quite significant. Egerton seems to follow the classic British style of translation where emphasis is placed on exactitude and misses out on some of the nuance and wit that is more apparent in the Sverre translation."
4,Amazing Book.,"I loved this book. It's a very good second book in the guardians of time trilogy. I did find this book to go by more slowly than the other two books. This maybe the worst book of the guardians of time trilogy.. but if you read it you'll realise that man, if this is the worst book in the guardians of time trilogy I gotta read the rest.The Guardians Of Time Trilogy is a really suspenseful type of trilogy mainly suited for young adults. It has a really unique type of excitement in it. In the end you will want to read the next book, The Key, and continue your journey through this exciting trilogy called The Guardians Of Time."
1,Disappointing,"This movie was recommended to me by some academics, who set some pretty lofty expectations. But to me, this movie was nothing but disappointing. The aim of the director is obvious--to use an interweaving of speeches/poems as a way to argue against the Bush doctrine. But the director fails miserably at this. The movie's choice of main character is quite questionable as well. It's a bum who is definitely not worthy of being heard. The rise of corporation power? So what? Most importantly, this movie misses the bull's-eye in its persuasive power; it's clearly intended for those who've already formed their opinions. The movie's aesthetics may be quite pleasing, but pretty much everything else sucks."
4,Great case,"Case quality and design is excellent but the glossy screen protectors have blotchy white spots, I had some boxwave anti glare protectors for my pda phone that worked perfect.This company is a touchy lot; I posted a positive review about their company in the feedback section but stated my reservations about the screen protector. Multiple emails and a phone call later I agreed to removed said feedback since in fairness I didn't bother installing the splotchy screen protector which they insist looses its spots when installed. It may very well be entirely transparent when installed but since I round filed the supplied screen protectors on sight of the glare and splotches I can not confirm this.Beyond this the case stands on its own merits and IMO an anti-glare screen protector is almost a requirement in this unit's intended environments.All considered still by far the best case for my GPSMAP 76CSX that I have seen. Only reason for the 4 stars is the pest factor."
3,Hamilton Beach- no picnic,"I purchased this juicer because I lost my previous juicer (Braun 1972??!!) in my divorce a few years ago.This machine works. It makes juice. Especially my morning celery, cucumber, lemon, apple, ginger, garlic surprise. It is so good!The previous suggestions of placing a plastic bag in the large section to catch the pulp, that is helpful. But the machine when locked into place, and then turned on, blows the top almost off. The mouth where you place your juicibles spits back something fierce. One morning the plastic bag SOMEHOW jumped into the juicer and I got plastic bag slivers in the grates. Gross!Overall, I get my juice and that is awesome. But this machine is not great. In fact this morning, one of the metal latches FELL OFF.Thank god I received a bday gift certificate so didn't spend my own $$ on it. I will be asking Santa for a Breville JE900 Juice Fountain Professional Juice Extractor."
4,Better than expected,"I am happy with my purchase. Its easy 2 clean as long as u clean it immediately after use. It does make some noise but its 2b expectd. The pulp comes out decently dry. If yours doesnt, its because you're forcing the items thru 2 fast. Allow them 2 use its own weight 2 juice. No complaints."
1,The worst juicer I've ever encountered...,"I really wanted to love this juicer. My husband very sweetly surprised me with it after my old Juiceman Jr. died. I thought it would be awesome since it's bigger, costs more (that means better, right?), and I no longer needed to cut up fruit and veges before putting them through the shoot. Unfortunately there was as much, if not more, juice in the pulp than in my cup. This was not operator malfunction; I was feeding the apples and carrots in very slowly, but it was to no avail. My husband bought this based on glowing reviews about a powerful machine producing sawdust dry pulp. Either that person got an unusually fabulous machine or we got a bum one. Whatever the case, buyer beware!"
2,wasteful juicer,"I was very excited about receiving this juicer for Christmas but after getting it I am very unhappy. It's to large to leave out on the counter, very loud when turned on and wastes the pulp that you need to have in your diet. Would like to get my money back but don't want to upset my husband after he tried hard to suprise me with a juicer."
4,Does a good job,"It's easy to clean and use. It juices vegetables very well. It gets most of the juice from fruit. I've had it for about a month now and use it every day, I'm pretty happy with it."
5,Love this juicer,"I bought this as a gift for my health-conscious husband about 3 months ago, but I ended up using it. It makes great juice, but as others have reported, it's a bit tedious to clean. Placing a plastic grocery bag in the pulp catch does save time. You cannot juice all of a large grapefruit or orange at once because that amount liquid overflows from the grinder area before it can get out of the drain spout. You don't notice it until you clean it and then you find the mess inside. It's not a big deal, but it can be easily avoided by grinding slowly. I don't think it's too loud. It's just as loud as my KitchenAide blender. Overall the clean up time is worth it for this juicer, especially at this price."
1,Great for price,Great juicer for the price. Yes I'm sure you get more juice from one of the higher end machines if you want to spend the money. Nice wide mouth easy to insert fruits and vegetables and easy to clean with brush included if you clean it right after use.Three months later this thing has completely burned up making apple juice. Inside plastic melted to motor. Too ate to return to amazon but gonna try to getmy money back directly from Hamilton beach.
4,Can be annoying,"Juices well but the clean up is gross. In the instruction manual it says to put a plastic bag in the pulp 'collector' (wtf?).If you don't, then you're pretty much stuck cleaning orange, kale, apple or whatever the hell you put in the juicer out of the big brown base. Other than that it does it's job it's just messy and I wish they at least sold bags that are fitted to prevent the mess."
3,Not simply a juicer,"NO PROBLEMS WITH THE MACHINE- JUST MY OWN MISCONCEPTION ON WHAT THIS ITEM ACTUALLY DOESWhen I purchased this item, I wanted a simple juicer. Something I could put an orange or lemon into and get the juice out. This item is more of an emulsifier. When I put the fruits in, it made a more frothy beverage, not just the juice. Had I wanted an emulsifier, this would have been a good one. The setup was simple as was cleaning. I didn't find the noise it made to be a big deal. I put a plastic shopping bag into the back to catch all the pulp to help with clean-up. Returning it was easy. I printed the label, put it into its box, took it to UPS, and sent it to Amazon. I had a refund in a few days."
5,Hamilton Beach Juicer Review,"Juicer is great! I get great reaults and I didn't pay three hundred dollars for it : ) I would recommend this guy to anyone, especially those wanting to start juicing but are reluctant to shell out the three bones most comparable juicers are priced at. If you read the reviews and consumer reports, the Big Mouth Pro is right up there with the best of them. Happy juicing!"
1,manufacturing mishap,"ordered and received intact. Upon opening the box which was very well packaged, i noticed something loose. It was the on/off switch. I thought it was an assembly part. I realized also that something was shaking inside; it was the on/off switch screw or nut --- and i realized that the switch was not attached when compared to the picture!!Manufacturing quality control defect. Did not want to take another chance and returned --- will try another brand."
1,stay away,"I bought this juicer based on positive reviews and I am very disappointed, and will be sending it back. I've seen other juicers before, and have never seen so much waste and pulp left behind as this one. I will be buying Jack Lalanne's juicer, it's only a few bucks more but my friend owns one and it leaves much less pulp behind."
4,great juicer for the money,"i like how fast this cleans up. i like how fast it juices and how much juice you get. i dont like how loud it is. and that like with all centrifugal juicers, the juice doesnt keep you have to drink now and cant save it. great price."
4,Hamilton Beach Juice Extractor (Juicer),"Works fine, although a little messy to clean up (as they all probably are). Didn't get as much juice from apples as I'd expected, but that may be due to my inexperience. No juice at all from bananas (must be mostly pulp). Overall, I'm satisfied with it, and its cost was reasonable."
1,Broke after 2 months!,Juicer broke after two months of daily use! No warranty and the 30 day return window is closed! I will never recommend this product!
2,Great until...,"When I bought this juicer I loved it! It worked wonderfully- I could juice hard veggies and leafy greens if I wadded them up. It was also relatively easy to clean up- the only difficulty getting the spout clean. Now, all was fine and dandy until one day it suddenly wouldn't turn on anymore. There had never been an indication of a motor problem or issues, just one day, it would no longer turn on at all even after I checked different outlets. And of course this happened about a month after the warranty went up.While this juicer may be a good price and a product that works well for a period of time it certainly doesn't seem to last well!"
4,Very good juicer,"I've never owned a juice extrator before, and have only used this one once now, but I'm really happy with it. It does a very good job of extracting the juice. The juice to food ratio was a lot better than I thought it would be and the remaining solids have about the consistency of cookie dough. The only thing I don't like is that it kind of spits at you a little everytime you take the handle out to add more fruit or vegetables. Not very much, but you don't want to get any little dots of beets on your shirt. I don't know if other juicers do this, but I'm guessing thats the price you pay for getting the big mouth. We just threw a bunch of stuff in there that we had in the fridge: beets, kiwi, apples, pears, oranges, carrots, celery, then taste it and a little more sweet fruits, or a little more lemon and vegetables for tartness to get the taste right."
4,Everything I expected,"Man of few words - This juicer does all I want it to do - highly recommended. Easy assembly, easy cleanup and easy to store - what more is there?"
3,This was our first juicer,We purchased this juicer around 5 months ago. It works great with a new blade and filter. Once that blade starts to get worn the juice becomes fairly thick. Also I did not find the replacement parts easy to find. Once they were back in stock I purchased two of the blade/filters from Hamilton Beach as this was the only place I could find them. I felt they were a bit pricy and the shipping cost was high in my opinion. We have very hard water which may have contributed to the fact that I had to replace this part after 4 months.
4,Good for the beginning juicer,"I've read through some of the bad reviews on this, and noticed they were mostly a few years old. We purchased this juicer last summer/fall to see if we could and would make juice and drink it. I notice others complained about pulp spilling over into the cup and the unit dieing (sp?). We have had no such problems. I have used it probably 50 times and no pulp whatsoever in the juice. Unit is still operating as it did when I unpackaged it. It does produce a lot of wet pulp, and I can see us buying a more expensive model that will extract more from things like spinach, but for an entry-level juicer, I think it's hard to beat."
5,Works great.,"The product works very well. As promised, it has a big mouth which makes it very easy to use. Clean up is very easy. I am very happy with the product."
1,Broke after 5 days.,"Bought this juicer to do a juice fast and it broke after 5 days. Currently, sending back for refund and don't know if Amazon will grant that or not. I'm not happy. It tends to make a mess. I wouldn't buy this product again. Spend more money for a quality juicer."
3,Good and Bad - Was hoping for more.,"First things first - cover the vent with tape or you may end up with a carrot volcano in your kitchen like I did. Still dont know why they'd design it like that. What an awful idea.This thing juices carrots well, but fails miserably with almost everything else that I've tried.All fruits, harder or softer, create a wet paste in the extraction bin (like apple sauce) and I'm losing a lot of juice to that. Apple skins go through whole like the machine cant handle them. Third juicer in the past 10 years and never seen that.Since there are good and bad reviews for all juicers, I guess I would have more buyer's remorse if I had similar gripes with one that cost me a couple of hundred bucks, so I'm satisfied and that's as far as I'll go on this one. If it lasts a few years, I'll say I got my money's worth."
4,Worth every penny,Gave this as a gift to my wife and she said it is a great juicer and real easy to clean. Make sure you clean the mesh screen right away but other than that the price is right and could not ask for more. Definitely worth buying versus the more expensive units.
3,It was as advertised,It is easy to disassemble.It is easy to clean.Noise level is as you would expect with such a device.
4,Very good juice extractor!!!,"We had it for around 4 yours, it was good run. Recently the handle got broke when it fall from Kitchen Top. We do have work around holding the handle it works."
3,Just Ok...,"This product does do its job, but it could be much better. Cleaning is rather easy (rinses out quickly) except for the fliter. You're gonna have to scrub that for a while. It is kind of loud though. Overall its a good product, but I would try one thats quieter and gives a little more juice!"
4,does what it is supposed to do,"for the proce this is a good juicer. I've had it for a few weeks and so far have only used apples with it. It can juice an entire apple and produce about 1/2 cup of juice. The pulp is easy to extract from the machine and has very little juice left to it. I took the advice of the other reviewers and used a grocery bag in the pulp container. Makes cleaning much easier. the only hard part to clean is the strainer, but they provide a nifty little brush in the box that cleans it nicely. everything wlse is easily rinsed/ washed. It's easy to assemble and disassemble for the dishwasher. Overall I think it's a good product, especially for the price."
3,It was working great until.....,"Less than a month of use, and not daily, and one of the latches fell off. There is a pressed-fit bearing that holds on the the metal latch and this fell out and the handle off. You can't just put it back together. Disappointed to say the least. It is easy to use and clean and does a fair job on everything I have put through it."
2,"Okay, for about a month...","This juicer is pretty much what you get for the price. After about one month, the filter cannot handle anything really fibrous (it starts to vibrate all over like its getting ready to explode) and you have to clean it out after each item is put through the juicer...very annoying. Also, somehow the pulp flies through the cracks in the catching basket and spews pulp all over your kitchen...that is not cool either. All in all, I guess you pay what you get for. I am upgrading to something decent. It is just a ""starter juicer"" for someone on a budget."
5,Heck of a Juicer,Very pleased- Fast and easy to clean. Great tip in putting empty grocery bag in waste bin as essentially all you have to do is toss it. Well worth the money.
2,Not what I expected,I used the juicer on carrots. It was my main reason for getting it. There was a lot of juice in the pulp enough so that I could squeeze it out and there was also a lot of pulp in the juice. I ended up returning it cause I was too disappointed in it.
4,"Nice Juicer, But.......","This really is a nice, heavy , well built juicer. However, it's really a nightmare to clean (the screen is really difficult to clean). It does remove all the pulp, so if you want pulp in your juice, this one is not for you.I used it a few times and put it in the garage in it's box. I'll sell it at a yard sale. I'm buying a Vitamix."
1,waste of money if you plan to juice,"Its unfortunate. Two day after starting to use it i had to buy a new one. It is way too loud and does not juice properly, the new one i bought yielded over 50% more juice. Spend more money to get quality"
1,The worst juicer ever!,"This juicer is a nightmare. I was so excited to use this as my last juicer died a few months ago. This juicer has a small vent towards the back of the discharge hood. That little vent sprayed carrot pulp all over my brand new kitchen. I shouldn't have to put a piece of tape on a brand new product. The pulp was also pretty wet, which means it's wasting lots of yummy juice!When I was packing it up to return it a little spring came flying out from one of the side arms...what a piece of garbage. Just another lesson for me on why not to cheap out. I will be buying a champion juicer instead."
1,Arrived Broken,The on/off switch was at the bottom of the box when it arrived. This is such a small thing and the box was well shipped so it couldn't have been because of damage during shipment. The box seemed re-taped also. Very disappointed that they would knowingly send something damaged.
3,Works well,"It works well but you wast a lot using this kind of Juicer, after i got this one, I found out they have some at Sam's that you get a lot more joice out of."
5,professional model at discounted price,The only drawback to this machine is it's noise factor and pulp collection in the hood. For the price you can't beat it. shipped sooner then promised. Very satisfied.
3,Works fine.,"Bought this to try a new ""juicing"" diet...the machine worked well, but was a hassle to clean, especially the pulp!"
1,Great dissapointment,Had this six days....Particles occasionally slipped out the vent during use. Feet on this caused black marks on counter-top which were difficult to clean up. Item seemed to juice well and on the sixth day the motor failed and stopped properly juicing.
4,Great juicer for the price,"Bought the juicer because my husband wanted to be healthier. We chose this juicer because 1) I wasn't sure how long my husband would want to ""juice"" for and I didn't want another expensive appliance sitting in my cupboard. The price of this one seemed reasonable. 2) This juicer seemed to have easier clean up. 3) I have other HB products and have been happy with them.I used the juicer regularly for a little over 2 months. Some tips on using this juicer:-To get more juice from the vegetables, wash the metal mesh strainer after every full ""cup"" of juice produced.-It's a bit messy even though there's a cover. You have to wipe down the counter and back splash surrounding the juicer of vege dust.FYI if you're thinking about ""juicing""...Juicing is a lot of clean up. You have to wash every single piece of the machine."
4,Juicer,"This juicer works adequately but despite being called a big mouth, it certainly could use a larger mouth. We have to cut up some of the fruits and veggies to fit them in. It is somewhat messy with the pulp and the amount of juice extracted seems small. Overall it's a good buy for the money but if you're interested in juicing often, you will likely need to spend more money for a better unit."
5,Completely satisfied!,extremely pleased with this book! no rips or damage or wear on it and there was even a book mark with it! looks just like mine did when I got mine as a little girl. My daughter loves it!
5,In-depth and complete,"As a student interested in Mesoamerica, I found this book very well written and very in-depth. The maps and pictures are excellent and help the reader to relate to the areas that are discussed in the book."
1,TOTALLY UNBALANCED. DISAPPOINTING ...,"This book lost almost all his credibility. Why ? How, in a book called ""FRENCH ACES OF WW II"", the writer dedicates only five lines ( that's right, five lines !! )to the greatest of them all, Pierre Clostermann of the RAF ?!! ( according to French official sources quoted by the author himself ). It seems that the writer want to avoid the controversy surrounding Clostermann scores: the British ( for whom he flew during all his career in WW II ) credit him with between 11 and 15 air victories, and the French give him 33 !! Ohter than this, the book doesn't even mention Rene Mouchotte, a great leader of the first Free French squadrons in RAF - numbers 340 and 341 ( although he was not an ace ). Weird distribution of topics, because Frenchmen in the RAF have only six pages to their credit ...It seem the writer got completely lost in the vast ammount of information he probably had, and the result was this catastrophic, disappointing book !!!"
2,VERY WEAK,I have read about twelve books in the Oxprey Aircraft of The Aces series. I can state for sure: this is the worst I've read so far.
5,git it,"The mans a Spirit insighted,Spiritually led interpretating... we have most of his books and share them.People who have read these books are ministers,prison ministers,Theophostic ministers.LIKE!"
2,A fair guide but honestly I expected more...,"A fair guide but honestly I expected more. As a new surfer, I found surfing much more physical than I expected. I bought this book for help. The strength ie weight-lifting excerises that ddominate the bulk of the book seem excessive for a young surfer. This seems more like a coach training guide for team surfers. To each their own but I expected more and prob wont use this book much."
5,Excellent source for surfers,"Rocky has written a very accessible book that helps me, a formerly regular, and now infrequent surfer to stay fit for those few sessions a month. His routine really pays off for those of us who are weekend warriors, and don't keep our surf fitness up like we used to....by surfing everyday(and will help those looking to simply improve thier surfing). I found the explanations and photos to be great reminders for me to use proper form during the exercises and stretches. I have had the pleasure of watching Rocky in action, his routine works...try to out paddle the guy!"
2,Disappointing...,"There is very little in this book that the average fitness-minded person does not already know. Granted, it does provide some ideas how to properly structure your training, and also a few exercises (esp. plyometrics) that are unique to this book, but on the overall does not have detailed enough information on surf-specific workouts. Also, the instructions for some of the more complex strength exercises such as the squat are dangerously inadequate. While such exercises may be highly productive if performed with correct form, the description in this book does not include even basic aspects of the right technique, and may so set you up for injury. Even though this was one of the first, there are better books on this topic!"
5,GREAT STORY.WOULD MAKE AN EXCELLENT MOVIE.,THIS WAS A VERY CAPTIVATING STORY.I WAS REALLY DRAWN IN BY THE CHARACTERS.I HOPE THAT THERE IS A SEQUEL.
3,Could be better,"Great States #815-18 18"" Deluxe Reel MowerThis mower could have had a better design. The wing nuts with which it was assembled might sound like a good idea, but in fact they do not hold the frame securely, resulting in way too much give. We had to replace all the wing nuts (except for two) with lock nuts so that the frame would be sturdy enough to use. We would return it except for the hassle of doing so, but would NOT recommend the product as is. Great States is a good brand, but this is not a good tool."
4,Great States is Great,"This product was easy to assemble and no tools are needed. It is already adjusted for optimal performance right out of the box. Putting the handle together and then attaching it to the actual mower is as simple as putting a few bolts in and hand tightening a few wing-nuts.I was overall pleased with the way the mower worked, other then the fact that stalky plants are not always cut and just fold under the mower. Hit the tops of these when you are weed-eating and it's really not that big of a problem.4/5"
2,not a good quality device,the handle assembly is flimsy and unstable. i pushed the mower several times for short distances across a well maintained bermuda lawn with the blade set to only trim the top of the grass. the handle wobbled and torqued
4,"Green, but not for those who want ""manicured""","This mower cuts grass. Tall, strong weeds can be missed, which encourages you to dig them out, not merely mow over them. I've heard that mowing faster will be more effective, but at the speed I like to mow at, sometimes I need to go back and go over a weed a few times. It's green, it's light, it's not noisy --- it makes a light whirring sound --- but if you're thinking it's going to do the same job a power mower does, you'll be disappointed. This is an older technology that disappeared when power mowers became cheap. There's a reason for that.I'm happy with my purchase. I hate the noise and smell of gas mowers and the cords of electric. And, of course, a battery operated mower is only as green as your electricity and the battery disposal.It mows my lawn to a standard I am content with."
4,Works great!,"I have had this mower for a couple of weeks now, I use it to mow my almost quarter acre of lawn every 4-5 days and it has been working wonderfully. Cuts the grass well - leaves a nice smooth finished look. I got this one to replace my 3-4 year old Scott's mower that used to work just great (I had it tuned up twice but it never worked right again - not blaming the mower, it was used to death!), so I got this one, which was cheaper on Amazon. If this lasts me 3-4 years I will have gotten my money's worth and more."
3,It is about data management.,"Nothing ground breaking here. If you have the slightest idea of how databases work then move along. If you are interested in the field and have no idea....well then why the hell are you interested. Great book to start with. Seems to take a long time to get to the point though. I suppose they needed something to fill all those pages with, and make you feel like you got your money's worth."
4,"Good, but dull","Not a book that will ""make learning fun"" but it's a thorough introduction to terminology and concepts with lots of examples of MS Access Queries, SQL statements, design normalization, and more advanced topics. Charts, charts, charts on nearly every page, useful stuff but still, kinda boring."
3,Normal text book,Just a normal text book. I felt that some of the stuff was very well explained and some wasn't.I think they did a real good job of explaining normalization but I disagree that Fourth Normal Form is a necessary thing. Third Normal ought to get you where you ought to be in a database.The code examples did not work with my version of Access. This needs to be addressed. Maybe put a note on code examples which work and which don't work with Access 2000. I suspect they also did not work with Access 2003 and 2007.
5,Funniest Film ever!!!,"Of course,I've seen the Film first in 1994 running on a german TV-Channel called ""Kabelkanal"".A friend of mine told me some scenes about it and I had to lough and lough.One Day later,I switched through the Channels,and saw the first scene!I couldn't believe:It runs at 15.00!I switched on the VCR and wondered,watching the film,""How could this be?"".I had to lough and lough and lough and... in a short way:I saw the film about a hundred and fifty times (every time expecting a new joke!),untill I lost the video...That was in 1998,since then I'm searching for it..."
5,Demi at her best,"I bought this for ""Butcher's Wife"" because I think I have watched this movie at least 10 times. I love the idea that there are people that are meant to be together."
1,Pauley's 5 But The movie's a 1,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this is a terrible movie but thats where the agreement ends because I disagree with him that Pauley Shore is a shame to the acting community! I really like Pauley Shore and think he has made some darn funny movies and he was very good in them especially Encino Man, Biodome and son in Law. What I didn't like about Jury Duty wasn't Pauley Shore, I thought he was good but it was what he had to work with that wasn't good like a terrible script and humor that just wasn't very humorous so the 1 star is for the movie but Pauley Shore himself would get a 5!"
1,Lame and annoying,"1) Not only is the program core so old that it is a 640x480 pixel graphic, it will only run in full screen mode on XP. If your note book has a 1028x768 display, the fonts are all jagged and *very* difficult to read.2) The credits role at the end of every session and lock up your computer for over a minute. The only way around it is to Ctrl-Alt-Del and click on End Task. REALLY ANNOYING.3) You have to have the CD in your drive every time you start up. If you are on the road, have a spare minute to practice, and have left the CD at home, you are out of luck with MavisMake your voice count in the battle for decent software. Don't buy this program."
2,A Poor Typing Tutor Program,"I was very disappointed with this program. Problems:1) You have to put in the cdrom each time you run the program.2) You have to watch the intro credits and exit credits each time you run it - there is no way to bypass them. This adds almost two minutes of useless fluff to every session.3) The graphics and sound are distracting, and are not helpful in any way. There are 3D graphics showing finger placement that I found confusing. I just couldn't tell which finger was doing what. The program pauses every so often to give fairly useless comments.After a few lessons I gave up. I've tried other typing tutor programs in the past, and I'll go back to them."
3,none,This book is alright if you want a general idea of what the terms are for adoption. But as a foster mother and soon to be adoptive mother this did not give me to much new information about things that you wont learn on your own. It is very entertaining at times and very easy to understand.
2,Probably a good book in 1998,"The year was 1998. Bill Clinton was president and financial prosperity was enjoyed throughout the nation. And the Idiot's Guide to Adoption was written. It includes helpful charts from 1997, text about the tax credits, as they existed in 1997, and an enjoyably retro celebration of AOL. I was frustrated by this book after assuming, admittedly foolishly, that the book would be updated to its 2005 republishing date. I have not read the entire book, but the first five chapters appear untouched from its original version. The only advantage of this is the irony of the paragraph explaining to the reader that when it comes to adoption, you must purchase the most recent book you can, a few year old if necessary, but never more than a decade old."
4,guitar method in the style of,"there are 2 van halen dvds, in the style of collection. most guitarist do what they can to mimic the riffs created. by using the dvd you can see axactly how its done loop it watch it and play along till you master the cords,riffs,hammerdowns and pullups. by far the 1st van halen dvd is the best. ive never learned so much so fast. its a grat help to me and im sure others will fing it a great tool beyond a beginners book. it will inspire many to experment and create their own style and material. good luck frostie(bass) group""gangsters"" city/state jax fla"
1,Not Good For Me,"I only took this product twice. The first time I got a headache and head pressure. I didn't see any improvement in energy or alertness. The second time I took it the same thing again happened and, in addition, I got sick to my stomach and had to throw up. I consume caffeinated beverages and other guarana products often with no issues. For me this product was not good and ultimately ended up in the trash."
2,"Not ""Adult"" Enough For Me","Before purchasing this, I read the reviews and I read the software description. Unfortunately, the content wasn't 'adult' enough. This is good for kids to teenagers. The games are like video games. The music drove me nuts & I turned it off, but then when the lesson went to a game, I had no music. One of the games is to type with rhythm - couldn't hear the music. Turned sound back on; couldn't figure out rhythm & I'm not musically challenged. Also, we have a large monitor & I found the system's onscreen font difficult to read; it was not all that clear. I was ""bleeped"" for typing a 'one' when the 'l' looked the same. Drove me crazy. But, like I said, this would be a good program for the younger set & the beginning typist. My goal is to maintain my 65wpm and possibly increase."
1,BAD...,"This tape is the worst tape in the world! I bought one pack, but all of them were defects. I used them to tape my trips, but at every end of the tape, it always messes up (the last five minutes). Low quailty. Don't buy it!"
1,Promoting Animal Cruelty!,"We adopted a pound puppy twelve years ago. She passed away this week. Our one regret is that we read this abominable book when she was a pup. Thank goodness we saw the damage we were doing to our innocent pet and threw the book in the trash before writing to the publisher.Lew Burke promotes animal cruelty. He suggests using a ""training collar"" which stabs the dog in the neck when he/she does something ""wrong."" He tells you to hide a small whip behind your back while training your dog, and to pull it out and smack the dog with it when the dog misbehaves. Mr. Burke also suggests that, for instance, if your puppy chews plants (as many do), that the owner stuff the dog's mouth full of plantlife and then tie the mouth shut and tie the dog up on the shortest leash possible. And that's only the beginning.Anyone out there who cares about any living creature, especially their pet, will avoid this book like the plague!"
4,axis and allies,"One problem I found in the game was upon opening it and beginning, i found it didn't have a product code to register the game with. I have found several games off the shelves and ordering that have not had this feature. I had to find it off of the internet, which worked and I am now playing the game. The game is fun and interesting. It is a strategic thinking game. I haven't been able to win much on the hard level. Good game otherwise."
4,Go Army!,Game is great - lots of mods to choose from and it's fun being able to choose your opponents!
3,Micro Management,"This game can be played in couple of different modes. If you want to play the old board game, you can. Or, you can can REALLY micro manage each encounter in detail. This can get a little tedious at times and can be frustrating. I felt like something was missing from the game however and it wasn't until I read another review that hit the problem right on the head! No naval involvement at all!! Once I realized this it really took some of the fun away from playing the game. Overall, it's still a pleasant way to kill a few hours and feel as if you can change history with a brilliant strategy. It's like opening your old toy chest and playing Army for a while. Kinda cool."
2,Kinda lame,"I was hoping this game was a direct copy of the classic A&A board game, but it is not. it is an A&A themed knockoff."
1,Missing Adapters on Windows,"I love A&A; and have played it on a computer - loads of fun. This product installs but will not play stating that it is missing the needed adapters. I have tried to go online to find a patch without success. There is no clear phone number or point of contact on the package to help with this. If the game worked, I would probably give it 5 stars. So far I haven't been able to play at all.When I did go online to search for answers, I found that this is a common problem that others have also run into."
2,Good grief this is tiresome.,"This is a one-joke/one-issue movie that isn't clever, nor does it cover any new ground, and the central charater is a whining irritating self-centered dullard who can't accept that someone he loves might not love him back. (It sure wasn't hard for me to imagine.)The supporting characters are dull and lifeless, and one of them proposes to the central character. I had difficulty caring. I kept looking at the time to see whether it was almost finished.I must say that if you're interested in this movie, please do yourself a favor and see ""All Over The Guy."" It's in ENGLISH, it's cute, funny, intelligent, manages to avoid scenes of public urination, and it's much more enjoyable and affecting that this clunker. ""Just One Time"" is also noteworthy, supporting the same basic story line as this movie, and is also far superior in every way.I wouldn't say completely avoid this as a rental, but it's certainly not a ""keeper"" (or even close) for me."
3,a cute romp; not much depth,This is a reasonably amusing flick about a gay man in love with his hetero roommate and contemptuous of said roommate's female love interest. Various misunderstandings and clashes ensue. A wedding finally happens. There is really not much more to it than that.Okay for brief entertainment.
1,No photos,"Quite expensive for no photos- and no indication that there won't be any. Much more expensive than the paper version without photos. Quite disappointed.Other than that, the best translation of one of the best books written. But you know that already."
1,"Waste of time, paper, ink","The genres of chick lit and mystery do not mix well, at least not in this book. I'm quoting a friend when I say that this book was not fluff, it was lint."
4,Surprising,"The blurb on the back of the book, nor the other reviews, prepared me for this book. When I saw a book titled ""Little Bitty Lies"" with a very light looking cover and a blurb that talks about a suburban wife who makes up some lies to keep up with the Jones', I thought it would be a light, typical story with some humor and a traditional happy ending. Little did I know that the story would be far more complicated, dark and deep (all good things). Definitely some unexpected twists and turns in the storyline and in the characters. I would recommend this book as a good read."
4,Little Bitty Lies,Really enjoyed the CD's. I have read the book prior - but its a good one so listening to it while driving was great! I would recommend this to others
2,"'Music""","where is the long version of the single madonna..............Hello! i can re-mix them better than the 9 ""whatever"" re-mixes...........Single is much BETTER!"
1,No stars here...,"If you don't vomit after seeing this piece of garbage you really must be sick. It is absolute filth, plain and simple. No wonder Jennifer Jason Leigh's ""career"" went straight to the toilet."
3,A good starter book for a new rider.,A good book for a new or inexperienced rider. Not for the experienced rider. Too basic and simple. Not too much except maybe reminders of what a rider may have forgot or something he is doing wrong. Slowride5
5,Street Strategies : A Survival Guide for Motorcyclists,"Hough does it again!This follow-on to his previous book ""Proficient Motorcycling"" (also quite good) is very readable and specifically designed to highlight specific hazards and how to spot/avoid them.The chapters are actually just long paragraphs that are brief and to the point.I'm a new biker so I really need this kind of info. Even so, I bet that experienced hands would find the topics covered a helpful refresher. They are presented in alphabetical order so the reader can specifically find and focus on a specific situation.Highly recommended."
4,Nice!,I ordered these for my bridesmaids to wear the day of the wedding and they are nice. All the bridesmaids liked them too!
5,Lovely,"Product shipped was exactly as pictured. Quick shipping. Given as a Christmas gift, and they loved it!"
5,Outstanding,"Such beautiful memories of when my folks played music like this.It was a time whem life was so simple, laid back, and easy going.."
1,Beautfiul but keeps horrible time for a Seiko,"I loved Seiko watches years and this one was so beautiful I decided to go back one. My only issue is that it gains about 6-10 seconds every day! My $15 digital Timex keeps more accurate time than this watch. I'm totally shocked because I thought Seiko watches (even the automatic ones like this one that are wound by just the movement of just wearing the watch) kept time accuracy to within seconds PER MONTH. Oh well, no idea what I'm going to do with it at this point...."
4,Great deals for old classic shows,Very pleased with the ease of making this purchase and how fast it came to my house. My mom will be thrilled with this when she opens it Christmas morning.
4,breath of fresh (albeit nasal) air!,"Season one is very interesting to see,especially how the show progresses and the characters develope.I highly recommend that you check out the special features , Fran's commentary on two of the episodes.It gave me a bit more insight into the creative minds behind the scenes.I look forward to the next installment of the series."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The first time I saw the Nanny, I was hooked. It was the hilarious wit and sense of humor everyone on the show had that sparked my attention. Ever since I started watching the show 2 years ago, I watch it every night at 5 and 5:30. I can't get enough of the Nanny."
4,it works,"Received the umbrella stand quickly, but poorly packaged. Plastic grips on the bolts to tighten the umbrella were cracked and came off. Stand also had some rust. Received replacement within a week and was in much better condition. Stand is heavy, but a medium wind will tip over an open umbrella - we used a small bungie cord to strap the center part of the umbrella to the deck railing - no problems now."
4,One of the better ones,"Tucker O'Doyle is simply a fun book! As a fan of Harry Potter I am always looking for good fantasy alternatives since the last book is nearly out. I read many, some are good others not so great. HAving said that, I really enjoyed Tucker, there is less to remember as far as names and such go- but the journey itself is very interesting (with a big surprise in the end). You can't help but fall in love with characters such as Mr. Harvey and Curious. I love the magic system, Tucker is a wizard but its not what we see again and again in fantasy. My favorite part of this book is that it doesn't borrow from everything else like most fantasy books do. Great job!"
4,It's definitely a good adventure,"I got this book when my school librarian recommended it because I said I liked Eragon and Eldest. It's like Harry Potter in that we're dealing with a regular kid who winds up getting himself involved in a world of magic (and actually becomes quite powerful by the end).. The Hobbit comparison (at least what I think) must stem from the nature of the quest. It's mission based, kind of linear.It's a good book, it flows along really nice and has a few cool twists. Both my 12 year old sister and myself definitely enjoyed Tucker O'Doyle."
3,incompatibility,I bought a pioneer cd recorder and tried the maxell blank cds.I took some recorded ones that were made to work and tried thems on several brands of cd players.Out of 7 players it would play on 4.I switched to tdk and had much better results
5,"For a reflective afternoon,","I have had this cd for awhile now and I'm still moved by it. If you are unfamiliar with Youssou N'Dour his talent is immense. If you are simply unfamiliar with this album this is for quiet reflective afternoon, this doesn't mean the songs are sad and sappy, its just that they have an energy all their own.Mr. N'Dour is the Sengalise singing sensation. It has an African, Cuban, Caribbean sort of vibe sung in either the West African dialect, French or English. The cd booklet is translated into English.He brought popular music to Senegal. The music and the voice togther make for a haunting and enchanting sound."
4,Not bad....,I just finished this one. Good read and good follow up if you have read 'Donnie Brasco'. This book ties up alot of loose ends (especially w/ the murder of the three Bonnano captains). I rated this one a four because it went into detail in some areas and glossed over some others. I would like to have seen some org chart (like in Roemer's book about the Outfit) with the various caporegimes and soldati. I thought the court excerpts interwoven with the storyline was a bit distracting.
3,not bad,"This is a pretty good rundown of the whole Bonanno soap opera. NOt much of this will be new to anyone who has been following the melodrama closely as it has played out over the past five or so years, but casual readers should be enthralled. I was looking for more info about Vincent Basciano, who is only mentioned briefly toward the end. Also, the lack of an index is a big minus; why do so many true crime books lack indexes? Damn, that's annoying.Ivan Rorick"
4,The real heroes are revealed,"Finally the story is told about how civilians helped to rescue so many of their fellow workers on that terrible day. Days after 9/11, we were led to believe that the only heroes were the NYFD and the NYPD. Now we see that there were other heroes, the office workers who risked their lives to save others, who stayed when they could have run, who died because they didn't want to leave others alone. I would love for someone to tell me why a man paralyzed from the neck down was left to die on the 27th floor? Over and over it was written how firefighters stopped at that floor, spoke to the man, told the man's co-worker to leave and then walked off. Why wasn't this man carried to safety?"
4,A Harrowing Account of What Happened,"The book makes you think about what the people trapped in the building really went through - more in depth than the news reports. It shows the sacrifice the police officers and firefighers shown in trying to save victims. The only thing I didn't like was the technical jargon after segments of person's accounts - like what the building code was when it was built, floor descriptions, etc. I think this should have had it separate chapter in the back. It kind of thrown me off as it jumped right back into personal accounts after explaining something about the building."
5,Intense,This book certainly showed true courage on the part of everyday Americans who helped each other on such a horrific day. It was inspiring and heartbreaking. I will definately reccomend this to my friends.
1,Routine,"I wanted to like this book, but it is little more than a thorough feature story for a newspaper. Very little sense of drama or horror. The event is somehow rendered flat and boring. No small feat."
4,Kindle Version of 102 Minutes,"I did enjoy the book, however one can enjoy a book about something so devastating. I think more could have been done to enhance the pictures that were included in the story. You could not enlarge the pictures, so if you're not an eagle, you probably will not like this either. Otherwise, the story was well told, so well, that I could actually visualize the devastation."
5,"A dramatic, important chronicle","This book dramatically relates what was going on in the towers that morning in New York, with an occasional look at activities outside. Periodically the story breaks away to talk about the buildings themselves: the design, engineering, peculiarities, mistakes, and so on, presented in a manner suitable for a novice like me. The authors are writers at the New York Times and the discourse is very straightforward journalism--my favorite kind. I did have to break away from my reading a few times because of the trauma, but I recommend this book for adults and many teens.I had finished my Christmas shopping but impulsively went out and bought copies for my children and their families."
3,A beautiful and inspiring recording,"Actually, I was hoping for more when I ordered this recording. I have read the book numbers of times and years ago purchased a cassette recording of this classic spiritual masterpiece. I nearly wore out the cassette from use, but somehow misplaced it during a move, so ordered this recording to replace the older one. However, this is a different recording and perhaps I am too used to the voice on my older version because I was not impressed with the intonation and feeling of the reader's voice on this recording. Perhaps some will enjoy this version for what it is and find inspiration from it. I hope so, because the words are truly beautiful. However, IMHO the earlier recording (not sure who voiced it or produced it) is vastly more inspirational. This one is better than nothing however!"
4,Cuba+Puerto Rico=WIN,"""La Sonora y El Nino"" as well as ""Que Bendicion"" are two very good songs showing off Cuba's finest music along side ""El Niño Bonito"". This includes a couple of boleros, nothing really special there. ""Borracho Yo"" is a good song about how he drinks because simply likes to drink. This is a very good collaboration between the two. The musical performance is solid, just as la Sonora Matancera's storied lengthy career. The chorus singers to me make this album a lot more enjoyable, something similar to when Pacheco sang chorus in this albums. The standout of the album has to be ""Vamonos Pa' La Rumba"" a very fast paced song with nice bongo playing. My only issue is sound quality which should be better if Codigo decides to remaster it. Overall, a solid album."
1,Poor customer support.,"Purchased a mechanical water temp gauge about a year before I found an alternate use for it. During the installation process I discovered that there was no sensor nut on the capillary tube. Apparently the nut was not installed during gauge assembly. This tube is filled with ether gas and is pressurized and sealed. In order to install this piece, the tube must be disassembled from the gauge. Needless to say there is no way of installing the nut without breaking the seal and loosing the gas. I wrote to the their customer support about this situation and have yet to receive a response. I am now going to toss the gauge into the trash and buy another from one of their competitors. Can not be any worse regarding their quality control and lack of customer service."
2,typical,"I agree with that other guy's advice: The Melody At Night, With You--Keith Jarrett. As soon as I heard it, I knew that it was what I wanted to hear. I am surprised, however, being that it was made within the last five years.As far as ""Places"", and others by Brad, I think too many players today try too hard and lose the soul in their playing. Don't compare this to Bill Evans, please. This reminds me of Tuck Andress--sorry, I mean I know the guy definitely has chops, but at what cost?"
2,A Bit of Cacophony,"First, let me say that I'm a jazz lover, but have a definite preference for the more soothing variety. I cannot relax to the sounds of an orchestra tuning up or anything similarly discordant. Prior to this purchase, I had read a favorable review of Brad Mehldau's recordings in Time Magazine, so I was excited when this CD arrived in the mail. Certainly it isn't a totally unpleasant listening experience, but I am not ready to order another CD by this same artist. I would rather play something by The Rippingtons or Diana Krall."
4,Charanga at its best at the end of the 80's,i gave it four stars because its a pretty good album. Similiar to there early work in the 80's. But this album to 89' is a smoking charanga album. for those that crave the cuban/puerto rican style charanga this is it. It is worth the money.Every track is dancable and feels very 70's. Very pleased with this album
3,It really didn't taste all that great. It ...,"It really didn't taste all that great. It was best when it was ice cold, but I really didn't enjoy drinking this at all and probably wouldn't buy it again."
3,flash takes too long to get ready in between shots,So far the camera works fine. But I am finding that the flash takes much longer to get ready in between shots than other digital cameras I've had. This is the first one I've purchased that uses AA batteries instead of a special rechargable battery that is specifically for cameras.
5,mhufty,I recently upgraded from a Canon PowerShot A310 to this PowerShot A570IS. I wanted a quality camera that would do everything I could possibly want a camera to do. This camera has been awesome. The price was $40 less than Best Buy's sale price and I got free shipping from Amazon. You can't beat that. I researched cameras for two weeks before deciding to purchase this one. I'm just a dad with two young ones who will probably be in 99% of my pictures. The video quality of this camera is very good. You will want to purchase a carrying case and a better memory card. I'd suggest 2 GB if you plan on using the video feature very often. One other feature I liked with this camera is the fact that it takes AA batteries. Simple to replace and cheaper.
4,Good with Good Batteries,We are rather happy with this digital camera as the pictures are of much better quality than that that we were able to get with our previous dig cam. The only knock on it is that you have to be particulary careful about the batteries you put in. They must be brand new and never have touched human (i.e. greasy) hands. The instructions for the batteries are given in the maual and are verbose. But I just have never used a device that was so particular concerning the batteries. Now that we follow the'rules' we are able to get almost 200 pictures per set of batteries. Disobeying the rules means that you maybe get thirty. Big difference.
1,Horrible Outdoor Camera,I purchased this camera on march 14 or so. I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon on how it was such a great camera for the price. I went to Italy ( Venice and Rome ) for my 5 Year Anniversary. 1st day in venice it worked fine during the day. Next day it showed a big yellow blur during the daytime photos. I tried every setting on the camera and still nothing. Needless to say I had to buy Intant Kodak cameras all over venice and Rome because my camera wouldn't take daytime photos. I was very upset and ready to just throw the camera in the Trevi Fountain.I will never buy another Canon Camera again !!!
4,"Excellent Features, Poor Battery","Frankly, I think the A570IS hits the sweet spot. Great photo quality, excellent feature set (from full auto to full manual) and a good quality optical zoom.My only complaint is that it seems to go through batteries incredibly quickly, so buy a good set (or 4) of rechargeable AA's. Oh, and set up the stabilizer to only work when you shoot, not when you frame.Other than that, a great toss-it-in-your-bag-and-go camera (pretty tough too - my son left it out all night and it got filled with sprinkler water - we dried it out on the dash of a car, and it works as good as new. Really)."
2,a570is slow on flash recovery,"The a570is was replacing my Canon A80. Currently I use new Ni-Mh 2500 mAh batteries in the a570is. The A80 holds 4 batteries and the a570is only holds 2 batteries. It seems like the flash along with the battery power does not complement the digics III processor, the camera is ready for the next shot before the flash is, resulting in underexposed photos. I understand you can adjust the shutter and aperture, and films speed settings, but in my opinion the camera is underpowered. I have missed lots of shots waiting on the flash to recharge, or the second shot will shoot, but with no flash, but will be really grainy. I tested this out with the two cameras side by side, the a80 has a much better flash recycle rate than the a570is. However, the a570is does take great shots on the first take, but might be problematic on continuous shooting where a flash is needed."
4,Worth for money spent.. Good Deal..,I bought this camera only due to its IS (Image Stabilization) feature and it works perfect. The only other camera with IS is Canon S3 IS which is costly and not your pocket friendly. So i bought this small camera which i can carry in my pocket and which does not gives shaky/blurred images in low light or when your hand is not steady.
2,Battery sensor bad,"I bought this camera for all the obvious features. It's a good camera, but it will very quickly give a light that says the batteries are low, then it will keep taking pictures a while. It was sent back to the factory, and was not fixed. Same problem. Just wanted to report this. Not happy with this particular camera."
1,Terrible Battery Life,"It started exhibiting problems with battery life a few months after purchase... Turns out that it is a common problem related to some factory defect with the battery compartment and many people are having it. I threw away mine, it was so annoying to be out of juice after taking 20 pictures or so.BTW, I tried several different batteries with same results."
1,Nice Camera but eats batteries!,I bought this camera two years ago but have never really used it because of the battery life. I can only take 10 pics before the low battery signal comes on. Really?? What a waste of money! I would stay far away from this camera as it will cause you much frustration and aggravation.
3,good camera for digital camera newbie,"This camera has met my expectations so far in terms of my being able to start using it quickly even though I am new to digital cameras. I haven't attempted taking pics to computer yet... The only thing I don't like so far (and I think several reviews mentioned this but I guess I wasn't understanding them) is that it takes longer than I expect from the time I push the button (down completely) to the time the image is captured, so I often miss the exact picture I want (the moment has passed). Maybe this is something I can work with (?) as I learn more about the camera."
1,Flawed power circuitry,"I had one of these for just over one year when the power circuitry failed. The symptom is that the camera will power down after less than a minute even with new or fully charged batteries. From my research, this is a wide-spread failure mode for this camera. Communicated with Canon. No joy. I loved the camera while it lasted but I won't do business with a company that will not support their product. I've had six Canon's over the past few years. But unlikely to buy another."
2,Broke in 5 days,Well my daughter (22) loved it as a Christmas present. 5 days later the lens would not deploy. The camera would therefore not work at all. Amazon is replacing it. We'll see how well the replacement is built.
1,Always running out of battery power,Takes decent pictures. But there seems to be a problem with the batteries running out after about 20-50 shots. Others have been having the same problem (just google this).
5,Love this camera!,"I really like this camera, it takes fantastic pictures. The zoom is incredible as well as the quality of the photos. Easy to use. Thank goodness we received it before we left for our fabulous vacation in Brazil - we have many great memories now."
2,Tabloid gossip!,"Cutsey title. But I'll agree with one reviewer saying this is gossipy tabloid stuff. Wertheim must have scoured the sewers scouting out dish on these players. Most notably under his trashing are Richard Wlliams who is quoted and re-quoted and made to sound certifiable. Every negative comment on the Willams' made in the last few years, culled from TV and other media, must be included here.And being a good herd journalist, Anna comes in for a good share of the juicy abuse. But really not much we haven't already read. I hate this kind of writing. There is little that is edifying or uplifting in the whole book. But gossip sells.One bright note is that Seles is given her proper due, described as the awesome, dominating player she was in 1993 (winning 7 of the past 8 Grand Slams) and on her way to becoming perhaps the greatest of all time."
3,"Interesting content, but who edited this book?","The content of this book is really interesting. It presents the story of a year on the women's tennis tour in chronological order, introducting detailed profiled of individual players at appropriate points. I very much enjoyed reading about life ""behind the scenes"" on the WTA.I couldn't help wondering, however, whether anyone at the publishing house took time to proofread the manuscript. There were many more errors of spelling, syntax, and word usage than I would expect from a mass-market hardcover. I wasn't even looking for errors, and yet I found plenty of them as I read the book. Hmmm...maybe Harper Collins has an opening for a copy editor..."
4,Sensational Season... 2 years ago,"This was a great, fascinating book for anyone with even a passing interest in women's tennis. Wertheim managed to correctly peg a lot of the top players by presenting their positive and negative qualities. The only problem, however, is that by the time this book came out another tennis season had just about come and gone, and new names and faces were replacing the ones mentioned in his book. For anyone who's read his book and liked it, I would also recommend his tennis mailbag at ...."
5,Top Notch; Top-Quality,This single features several hot NYC-style dance mixes; definitely worth having in your collection.
5,What a Great Story,"I just watched this great movie about two young men who travel (and experience to the hilt) across America on a Segway, the 12 mph Human Transporter. Not only is the scenery great but the happiness and frustration are intertwined to deliver a warm and innocent movie. I thought the music was great too. All of this makes you want to go out and do what they do, make the trip of a lifetime and at a pace you can ""smell the roses"" at."
4,Going back to the basics--or: less is more,"I found the material in this book to be extremely helpful. I first practiced the 26 Rudiments for a week or so, then began working on the excercises daily. Honestly, I discovered that by going back to the basics (the rudiments) I was able to play more efficiently, maintain a beter groove, and provide a great deal more feeling when playing."
3,OK.,"This book is ok. It has SOME Rudiment based grooves, but not nearly as much as I had hoped for. Most of the book deals with fills more than it does grooves or beats. The number of rudiments applied is also sort of limited.As an intermediate drummer looking to take it up a notch, the book fell short for me."
1,Does not work with Thinkpad t60p and docking station,"I have been trying to get ATI and Levono to fix a problem with the Thinkpad BIOS for 2 months. ATI has determined that the Thinkpad BIOS does not have enough ""extra space"".DO NOT BUY this if you have a Thinkpad T60p!!!From the ATI support: After further testing, it was determined that this issue is a result of a lock of option ROM apace that is reserved by the BIOS of the notebook and not a result of a problem in the video cards BIOS. The last conversation I had with IBM indicated that Levono needed to fix this (SOMEDAY). I have spent about $4000 to get a system that will support 4 video units, and have yet to be able to achieve that goal."
3,Cheap; get what you pay for.,"Not bad for the price I guess, but very cheap. The backs nearly bent off after wearing them twice. If you're extra careful, they do look nice, just not great quality."
1,NOT A BOOK,I ordered this Item thinking it was a book and I got a vhs. I was sent to this page when I was looking for a book. I already have the dvd and the vhs. Was very unhappy when I got it in the mail.
5,Great henna!,"I love it. It smells so sweet and it was delivered right on time! I love the color it turned out to be, and the applicator bottle works wonderfully!"
2,wouldnt buy again..,1st off. the product is orange. i thought it would dry up and be black. it looks like an orange sharpie on my skin.2nd. its very messy to put into the bottle which is not that big of a deal but whatever.3rd. the price for it is kinda overpriced
1,A VERY Bad Product,Bought this kit and had it express-shjipped so we could use it while we were still on vacation. Followed the instructions to the letter. Henna ink was thick and too congealed to apply (probably old). Nobody should have to pay for junk like this. No way to get a refund - only thick gunk left.STRONGLY RECOMMEND that nobody buy this kit!!
1,Keys fell off day one,"It was easy enough to put the keys onto the clips. However, the clips didn't stay secure to their bracket for even an hour. My car key and its clip fell on the floor at a store minutes after setting up the case. Glad I noticed. You get the idea. The base that holds the clips is soft and weak. The barb on the end of the clips meant to secure them into the bracket are tiny and inadequate. The leather, eelskin, however, is a delight. Too bad it's a useless item."
4,I love Michael Chabon,I love this writer and his books and being able to see his characters in action was a real treat.
3,Yanni writes a Musical,"I was pretty disappointed by this album. It may make a good show, but it is quite odd in that its tunes are either too simplistic or down right annoying. I am going to keep trying to like it, but buyer beware. If you are looking for what sounds like a weak attempt at a stage version of Yanni, go for it!"
3,poor performance on full frame,"I put this on a 135 f/2L lens on a full-frame Canon, and the result is pretty mediocre. There is a huge amount of vignetting, even stopped down to f/8. Looks like the vignetting might not show up much at f/8 if cropped to match a smaller sensor. Exposure is off by 1.5ev or so, and images have a soft look with a fair amount of chromic aberration.In the box was a little warning from Tamron that says ""This teleconverter is not designed for digital use."""
2,Doesn't do the job,"The item worked with my Canon lenses but I wasn't able to get any clear pictures. The view finder was fuzzy and hard to get a clear focus on anything, maybe one out of every ten pictures would just be acceptable but not really what I wanted. I was hoping this would be a cheap fix so I could avoid buying a more expensive lens but now I know; to get the pictures I want I'll have to not go cheap. I tried the item with a Canon T3i and a Canon EF 70-300mm IS USM lensI gave it two stars because I think if you’re not picky about your photos you may want to give it a try."
4,For younger readers,"This is a look at the emotional life of George Washington -- it tells Washington's biography, and suggests his responses to the events in his life. Younger readers will enjoy it; the illustrations make this book very worthwhile."
1,Poorly Written,"As a writer, Cheryl Harness desperately needs an editor for omissions, unity, logic & coherence. Shock value is found useful on computer games, but injures the understanding and imagines that children need a low thought standard. That is disparaging."
5,Post Avant Garde Jazz firmly rooted in the Blues,"Some free jazz floats off into the cosmos, never to return to earth. This remarkable CD keeps its feet firmly rooted in the blues, while taking off into the stratos. Side trips to Texas, the Mississippi Delta and Appalachia are also included in this musical adventure. A CD you will be playing in heavy rotation in ten years."
4,good history of fall of Saigon,Factual history of the fall of South Vietnam. Excellent video footage of the last hours at the American Embassy and the departure of American military and Vietnamese civilians.
3,"Would be a great game, but software flaky and untested","This would be a great game, but on the Mac it freezes up the whole machine after one or two minutes of play, and on the PC it loses sound intermittently. Also some of the activities evidently have not been properly play tested - e.g. the crane game requires far too much precision for a young child, otherwise it would be a great ""fine motor"" activity. I would say spend the extra $$$ and get Tonka Digs 'n' Rigs, which is very similar, is much more reliable, and comes with add on controls for the PC. [NB: since I originally wrote this review, we've had more success running this on the PC, and if we avoid the frustrating activities such as the crane, my 4 year old actually does get a lot of enjoyment from some of the other activities. I'll now upgrade my rating from 1 star to 3 stars, but I'd still recommend Digs 'n' Rigs over this title.]"
5,Easy to use,"Works perfectly. I have never had a cookie press before so I read other reviews and decided on this one. Great decision. It is very easy to use and works perfectly. I turned out a perfect batch of cookies very quickly. However, unless everything in your kitchen is in the metric system, get a recipe online. I couldn't believe how fast I turned out a beautiful batch of cookies. Well worth it's price."
1,Disappointed,The trigger was Impossible to control. The cookie shape quality was inconsistent. Tried a few recipes and cookie temp and texture - nothing worked.
2,falls short,"Normally, I love double cd's since it's two good albums for the price of one, but I have to say these two cds barely equate to one decent cd. These guys just aren't that great in my opinion. They're good compared to most people, but don't spend the cash if you can buy anything else from sasha or digweed. The dido remix is trash and the rest just doesn't seem to keep my attention. Falls seriously short of what I expected after hearing reviews."
3,New box and not the same tea,Ahmad tea has been my favorite for years but they have changed their flavored teas to be just like everybody elses instead the great tea it has been. The flavor and aroma used to be outstanding but it is now difficult even to detect. It is still a good tea but why buy a flavored tea if it isn't flavored? I hope I can find another tea that is worth looking forward to drinking.
3,"Overall this is a very good product, but ...","Overall this is a very good product, but it was a hassle to use this product every time I ate. I would have liked one pill to use just once a day. I did like the pill form, though; it was nice to not taste some nasty medicine."
5,"""I like it.. I love it..I want some more of it!!!!!""","This movie is a Comedic masterpiece, full of wit and charm that is rarely seen in today's ""Waterboy"" like pitiful comedies. Kudo's to Diane Cannon. WHAT A LADY!!!!!!"
1,Problems,I ran this software and it crashed my hard drive and deleted half of the data on my computer! It was a nightmare. All Mac users are now recommending Disk Warrier due to having the exact same problem as I did with Norton Utilities. Avoid!
3,Not bad....,"I bought these silk liners to wear under motorcycle gloves in cold-weather riding. I'm a Texan, so my definition of cold-weather riding is around 40 degrees.The gloves are thin enough that they can easily be worn under a pair of heavy gloves without discomfort, or without causing finger immobility. And, they're soft and comfortable - not a bad thing.The big question, though, is do they work - do they keep my hands warmer? The answer is yes, but don't expect miracles. I'd say they give me an extra 5-6 degrees of protection. In other words, a pair of gloves that couldn't keep my fingers warm below 45 degrees can now be used down to about 40 degrees. That definitely helps. But like I said, don't expect miracles."
3,They help some,They do help some. They are comfortable. If your hands get really cold and you are looking for something to keep them warm these are not the fix. In such case they are more likely to change your cold numb hands to cold hands.
1,WARNING: VERBATIM CD-RWs WILL NOT PLAY IN CAR STEREO!!!,"I bought a set of Verbatim 700MB Cool Color CD-RWs at my local computer store and was surprised to find that they do not play in my car stereo or home theather system. They will only play on a computer, and why do you need to burn a CD for that when you can listen to MP3 files? The rep at the computer store confirmed that some CD-RWs aren't compatible with regular stereos. Luckily, the computer store has agreed to return them but don't make the same mistake..."
5,An awesome joint compilation.,"As mentioned by the review's title, this album is a compilation of both artist's careers. Not sure why this was done, still music wise the album is absolutely fantastic despite the fact I'm not too fond of compilations. Willie's tunes include less popular, but good Lavoe songs like ""Te Estan Buscando"" and ""Guisando."" Tito Puente on the other hand, has several of his most popular tracks such as the forever great ""Ran Kan Kan"", ""Oye Como Va"" and ""Para Los Rumberos."" If you have Willie Colon's albums with Lavoe, you are in no need of this album. Content wise it's still a stellar display of musicianship."
4,"Jeanette Angell's ""The Illusionist""","When Julie Gower's father is accused of crimes against humanity, Julie's calm and ordered world is turned upside down. Jeanette Angell's latest novel explores the effect of the devastating revelations on Julie and her family as they struggle to come to terms with Albert Gower's hidden past. Readers of Jeanette Angell's previous novels will know to expect some interesting twists and turns and will not be disappointed with her latest offering. The characters are well drawn and credible and the combination of psychological insight and page turning drama will keep you reading and wondering until the very end."
4,"Lots of work to install, but worth the effort","My wives Honda CRV had terrible road noise. Upon removing the door panel we found there was only a small sheet of plastic between the door and the outer frame of the door. I applied almost the whole nine sheets to the doors of her car and it made a big difference. Now when we are driving we hear road noise coming from the rear of the car, so I am going to order another package of dynamat to do the rear of her car. It was a very time consuming process, but worth the effort."
4,dynamat,"I installed the dynamat in my 1996 camry. I did the front doors, most of the roof and half of the trunk. I didn't realize how quickly I would run through the product. I don't have a stereo installed yet, I decided to do this first, also just to try and make my daily drive that much quieter. It is a little quieter but it didn't make as much of a difference as I thought it would. But to be fair, I still have the floor to do, which is definitely where most of the noise is coming from.I didn't buy/use the wooden roller thing that is recommended. And I don't think it's needed, but might make it a little easier when doing large open areas like the roof, floor, and trunk but would be useless in cramped spots like inside the door panel. I warmed it up with a blow dryer, and my hands and did ok."
5,Dynamat extreme,"I drive a Scion TC with after market exhaust. Was looking for something to help cut down road noise and exhaust drone. One box basically covered the floor and inner fenders from the rear shock towers to the back of the car. I'm guessing I'll need 3-4 more boxes to do the entire interior. The stuff works though, with just the back end of my car done, it did quiet down the drone a bit and definitely less road noise coming from the rear of the vehicle. I was careful installing the stuff and only ended up with a couple small scratches, though I can see how so many where able to cut themselves on this stuff. It is very sharp as well as sticky. You will definitely want to wear some sort of work clothes for installing Dynamat. Also I would recommend the roller they sell for installing it, makes it a lot easier to work with."
4,Can't tell if it worked in my Fit,"I put this in my 2007 Honda Fit Sport and I honestly can't tell if it made a real difference. Sure it seems like the road noise is duller. The wind sound isn't as harsh but did it actually improve anything? It sounds like it got rid of some of the higher pitched road noise but the low dull roar still gets through, which might just be because of the tires. I put it in my two front doors (doubled on the outer and inner panel) and the rear hatch door. I still have a bunch left so I might do more but it takes so long I don't know if it's worth it. The first door took like 3 hours until I got the hang of how to do it and how to get the doors off. I can't say this isn't a good product, it obviously does make a difference in the sound but I don't know if it really works in my car. I probably won't know until I get new tires since I still have the stock, which have been said to be obnoxiously loud."
3,Durable as they say,"I used a box cutter to trim this product and it worked great.,I stuck it ontop of cardboard when I was cutting it because on the ground, my blade was hitting the dirt underneath. I was expecting the glue to gum up the blade quickly, but surprisingly it didnt, even when I did it extra fast.The 9 sheets included in this kit wasnt enough to do an entire car if youre going for lots of coverage. I used all 9 sheets on the inside of the suv of my explorfer. Cutting them was nice and easy."
4,Great Price & Value,"This model is superior to the of about a year ago. Works fine. However, its grout cleaning ability is questionable"
2,Save your Money,"Very disappointed in this product. Wet pickup is pretty good, but floor scrubbing leaves a lot to be desired. I usually have to do at least 3 passes in the same area to get it clean, leaving residual dirt marks on the floor. I'm working with a tile floor so this may be the problem since folks with pergo floors rave about this. I have better luck with a swifter wet-jet.Hoover floormate= $159.00Swifter= $24.95You do the math."
2,Not that good,"I purchased this floor cleaner 4 months ago. The first time I used it, the time spent cleaning my kitchen linoleum was excessive. The brushes do not contact the floor well enough to ""scrub"" it. They just sort of whisk the floor. The second time I used it, some stains were removed, but the vast majority of the black marks and food droppings stayed on the floor. It cannot remove a black mark from your floor.My solution? It is too late for me to return this item, so I will use it to vacuum up the water left over from the 12-inch floor scrubber that I will be renting from Lowes or Home Depot.The Hoover Floormate is designed for light-duty only."
2,Floormate H3000 is MUCH better than SpinScrub 500,"I have had an H3000 for over a year, and I have been very happy with it. It scrubs reasonably, and leaves the floors nicely dry when done.So, when the opportunity presented itself to get a newer model at a great price, I figured I'd give the old one to my sister, and keep the updated one.Well, no matter what I do, the NEW SpinScrub 500 simply does not pick up water as well as the original H3000. It leaves streaks and a fair bit of liquid on the floor. The original gets things almost completely dry with no special effort, but this one is just not up to the job. The scrubbing part seems about the same, and they improved the wastewater tank so it's easier to clean, and I do like the fold down handle. However, none of that matters since it really doesn't work as well as the original.....My advice: Get the H3000. It's a really great product. Avoid this one like the plague."
4,Tiled floors,"We have only had this a month but it appears to do the job on our expanse of white tile. We had the tile professionally cleaned and grout sealed before we bought this.It is a little loud, but tile echos a lot also. No complaints so far."
1,Disappointed,"When a friend raved about the used Floormate she had purchased at a garage sale, I decided to order a new one for myself. As I assembled it, I noticed a crack in the plastic on the main body of the unit, near where the nozzle clipped on. The piece of the plastic later broke off completely. At the nearest authorized service center, I found out that the part would take at least three weeks to arrive. So, instead I ended up returning it to Amazon and asking for a refund (the return process was very easy by the way and the refund promptly given). Never did have the opportunity to try it out. Haven't decided on whether I will try a similar product from another company."
4,adequate cleaning - easier than hand scrubbing,"While I will admit nothing will clean a floor like getting down on your hands and knees with a scrub brush, I find the floormate to do a decent job and it is easy enough that you can do it weekly or even more often if you choose. The best feature is the ability to suck up the dirty water versus just spreading it around with a mop. When I empty my water it is dirty and brown and the floor didn't even look that bad. At least you know some dirt came off! I find it best if you use really hot water, go a little slower to give the water/cleaner time to loosen dirt in the deeper grooves. My biggest disappointment with this product is that the scrub brushes seem to barely skim the surface. I wish hoover would offer alternate brushes to be purchased separately that go a bit deeper. Overall, I would still rather use this product more frequently than try to scrub by hand. It makes cleaning the floor a bit more exciting!"
4,Happy with it...,"We have laminate floors in most of our house, but we used to have carpets where there's laminate today. So we've gradually gone from needing to vaccum to needing to use brooms and cleaning tools like the Swiffer. Those that have tried it know that the Swiffer can become quite an expense with its supplies (pads and liquid). So we decided to sell our good ole Roomba robot (since we officially had little use for it any more) and decided to take this Floor Cleaner out for a ride.I can't speak about long term use with it yet (it's been a little less than two months since we got it), but so far I can say it does a pretty good job and we are happy with it. There's no ""free lunch"" and so is the case with this product, meaning it still needs to use a cleaning product to do its job, but at least it doesn't require a change of pads and it does a visibly better job than the Swiffer!"
3,FloorMate SpinScrub,This floor cleaner probably works great on a lot of floors but it didn't work for mine. The grout on my tile floor is too deep I guess because it doesn't clean them or the ridge marks in my tile. The brushes are just not strong enough (they are made of very soft fibers to prevent scratching I'm sure) or long enough to clean out the grout and ridges. I contacted the company to see if they made any different set of brushes and they don't. I love how it works and I'm sure it does a great job on a lot of floors. It just didn't work on mine.
3,Floormate,On/Off button needs to be held for a couple of seconds before it starts. Scrubber brushes don't clean the grout that good.
2,POOR ON DEEP DIRT,"I HAVE SOME TEXTURED TILES WITH PRETTY DEEP DIRT AND THIS DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH IT. HAD TO GO OVER GROUT BY HAND AND BRUSH. IF YOU PUSH IT VERRRRY SLOWWWLY OVER ONE TILE AT A TIME AND GO OVER EACH TILE FIVE OR SIX TIMES IT GETS ABOUT 70% OF DIRT OFF. ALSO THE CLEANER THAT COMES WITH IT SAYS ""CARCINOGENIC IN CALIFORNIA"" SO WHAT IT'S NOT CARCINOGENIC IN COLORADO? (JUST KIDDING) I USED REGULAR FLOOR CLEANER NO PROBLEM."
4,hoover h3030 fm,Used the Floor Mate within 2 days of receipt. It did a very good job on cleaning the grout in my kitchen and hallway. There was no need for me to get on my hands and knees to clean and dry the laundry room floor. Would highly recommend this product.
4,I don't like to do titles!,"I've tried all the flavors of Slim Fast powders and decided I like this one the best. The chocolate reminds me too much of what I'm supposed to be avoiding! This vanilla has a nice creamy texture and doesn't leave any after-taste in my mouth. I've been drinking it for 3 years, twice a day. Great product. I'm saving $1.70 per can buying it here, which is also a good thing."
4,Trudeau Gravy/fat separator,"Glad I purchased it. Does the job I wanted. When pouring, it doesn't get 100 % of fat out of the gravy, but close. Wish the holes in the top container were smaller. Holds up well in dishwasher."
5,GREAT PRODUCT-review from a kitchen gadget lover,"I love the Trudeau Gravy/Fat Separator. I like that it withstands heat from the HOT juices and washes beautifully in the dishwasher. It's supposed to be microwave safe, but I haven't tried that yet. In the past, I naively assumed that fat separators were meant to handle hot liquids--the separators cracked from the heat. The shape, size, and strainer on this Separator are terrific. I've given them as Christmas presents. I cook a lot and love kitchen gadgets--the Trudeau is truly a winner."
4,Great For Everyone!!,"I went into this book thinking that it would be talking about how I could be different in the office and be a better business-woman. Well, it did alot more than that. With the info that Allyson Lewis put in this book, it's good for anybody, from stay-at-home Mom to businesswoman!! Her personal experiences and small steps will help anyone going through any situation. This book helps you to create an action plan to support change in your life, make changes and keep the want of them going, helps you map out your goals and organize your work & home life to acheive greater efficiency. Great book!!"
5,My favorite GU,"In the end, for me this is the only GU release that holds together all the way through. It's just a solid, damn good album and one of a very small number of examples of house music that I would ever actually call ""beautiful"". The melodies, chord progressions, dubbed voices, everything are very dark and at the same time invigorating, almost contemplative but very energized. I think that that's the best characteristic of trance there can be. With this one it's hard to say which disc is better, though I think I might have to lean towards 2. But it doesn't really matter, because either one will contain something you really like and enjoy. Anyway, if you've heard of GU but haven't been convinced yet that it's a series that produces actually beautiful music, buy this CD. You'll be a convert after hearing it."
5,Dave on Deep Dish,"Well its good to see that Ali and Sharim have finally released a mix on the prestigious Global Underground label. It may be slightly darker than their previous yoshiesque releases but still is classic Deep Dish. As usual they have redited tracks to the subtle upmost to blend together a smooth constantly grooved seemless journey that sifts through mellow soul and funkey Progessive house with a trible edge. Never quite hitting a clamax but keeps on building trying to keep the dance floor simmering rather than boiling over.This must have definatly been a night out in Moscow to remember, for those of us who unfortunatly weren't there, all the best bits are on this mix, chosen by Ali and sharim themselves."
1,bands,"I ordered these bands thinking they had stirrups like pictured. Instead I got three wide bands (no stirrups) that you have to put around your legs, which isn't easy to do. They keep slipping off, I have to have the kind that you can stand on and pull up with stirrups."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have to say the product does look good, especially on a de-chromed truck. That is the only good thing I have to say about them. 2 of the 5 lights did not work, the LEDs are of obviously poor quality and I have doubts about how long they will last. The lights came with no instructions, and I did not see where in the product description that these are replacements for existing cab roof lights, not a kit for a truck which previously had none. Pass this brand by, Recon Lighting, and buy a different brand. Anything would be an improvement..EW"
4,Birbigs is the best in comedy!,"Having heard Mike on the radio several times, owning (and repeatedly listening to) his CD ""Dog Years,"" and seeing him live I can honestly say - Mike Birbiglia is the funniest comedian out there! The Secret Public Journal is just the latest of the greatest comedy you are sure to enjoy. The only down side: you can't fit all of the best jokes into one DVD! Love you Gerbigaboo!"
3,Buyer Beware--,I bought this set thinking it was new stuff---no wonder the old set is no longer being manufactured because Acorn has re-packaged Simisola/Road Rage with new picture on cover--I was so disappointed when I went to play and saw that I already had these stories--to be fair--did not play...Maybe Acorn inproved something.--I bought this set in MARCH BEFORE Amazon finally showed the episodes included ---my star rating is NOT for the stories or even QUALITY of the tapes but to make YOU AWARE of what is being offered--NEW COVER does not mean NEW STORIES..
1,Horrendous interference,"I couldn't afford to replace my broken Sony headphones (not grandchild proof, apparently) so I bought these. They are awful. The hissing was annoying because I just wasn't expecting it, as the Sonys had none. Then, in the middle of a program there would come a horrible, repetitive popping noise. I have always believed you get what you pay for. These should have been free. Do yourself a favor and save up for the Sony."
2,Didn't work properly.,The the right stereo channel didn't work. Sound came thru part of the time with popping sound and no sound part of the time but with a popping sound- perhaps a loose connection.Plugged into another TV to make sure but it still did the same.
2,wireless headphone,The quality of the product in regards to sound met my expectations for the price. The problem I encountered is the headset is not adjustable for smaller than exta large. I can not make them small enough to stay on my head when I am moving about.
1,RCA WHP141B 900MHZ Wireless Stereo Headphones,Battery life is ridiculously short in the RCA WHP 141B headphones -- on both conventional and Li batteries. The signal has turned to noise with no warning after two evenings of use.
3,"Ordered 3, 1 has stopped working within 1 1/2 months.","They are ok, but very staticy if you are not in the same room as the transmitter (Not a problem as I got these for TV watching purposes). I have 2 grandparents that use 2 sets and I bought a 3rd for my GREAT grandmother. One of the three has quit working and it is 20 days or so past the thirty day return policy, and the warranty from RCA is nearly worthless. Gonna buy another despite the bad set, since all three work off the same transmitter. For the price, they aren't too shabby."
2,Picked wrong headset,"Didn't know headset had to be connected and disconnected each time it was used. My Dad is 87 and the connector was too small for him to deal with. Other headset we purchased is just placed on charger, not manually connected."
5,tv headphones,"This is the best idea we had. Due to work, my husband goes to bed by 7pm. I would always wake him with the tv. It works great at a good price."
3,Good for the price,"If you're looking for an inexpensive set these are for you. I'm certain the more expensive sets have better sound quality but these definitely work for my purpose of listening to the TV in bed without disturbing my other half. You will need to turn the TV volume all the way down and the cable volume all the way up to get the best quality, there is minor hissing but nothing that really interferes with programing. The only benefit to this set vs a $10 set is you can recharge these, which is nice. My old $10 set ran through AAA batteries about every 3 weeks, and I only used them maybe 2 hours a day if that."
1,"Junk, Battery Holder Metltown, Don't Buy! Junk",A little noisy at times as long as it works. Battery holder slightly melted and it no longer works after less than 90 days of light use. I have a video on Youtube showing this product and its defects. Just search for RCA Cordless Headphones.
3,good it's okay~,it is very cheap and nice sound quality. I used this for one monthI satisfied with this and I recommend it to others!!!
3,Not as good as it could be,"My major complaint about this headset is its inability to be adjusted for optimum fit. It seems it was designed for people with HUGE heads. (Mine has been characterized as large and it fits too loosely for my taste). Secondarily, its effective range is far less than advertized. Pops and hisses are frequent even when source sound (HD TV) is set high and it seems very prone to RF interference."
2,Wireless Headphone by RCA.,Very disappointed. Had to buy an adaptor from Radio Shack for $16.00. Owners Manuel did not tell me that I had to plug it into the cable box for it to work. Now that I have it working I still get a shot of static occasionally which is irritating. Headphone is not adjustable.
2,Noisy wireless headphones,These are a lot noisier than the IR headphones I was going to replace. The sound quality is not good and there are a lot of Pops and Hisses.
1,Not good,Very cheap and uncomfortable on the ears. The sound leaves a lot to be desired. I sent them back.
4,Wireless Stereo Headphones 900MHZ,My remote headphones purchased fromamazon has worked very well for me.I use them for listening to the TV.My hearing is poor especially in thehigh frequiency ranges & with this headphones I hear most everything now. Theonly improvement I would suggest isan improved way to access the batterycompartment. I sometimes have difficultygetting the cover removed.
3,Works but has a lot of noise,The headphones produce decent sound but there is a definite hiss in the background regardless of the channel. I haven't tested the range but for close to my computer it works well
4,Exactly what I wanted!,"This is the second time I have purchased this headphone. They are simple, easy to set up and work perfect for what I need. I like the all over headpiece and it fits quite comfortably. I can walk upstairs to the kitchen to get something and I can still hear my program clearly. Great product for the price!!! thanks"
5,Love it!,"The product works just as I hoped. I feel a little like an airplane pilot wearing them, but they are awesome! I can wander all over the house and they come through loud and clear."
2,Non-adjustable head strap,"Pros: cheap headphones, look good on paper/ screenCons: headstrap is non-adjustable and set for a large head. These would fit neither my wife, nor I, nor a friend of mine with a larger head.pity, we really wanted them to work out. You get what you pay for, and these are at the lower end of the market."
4,A problem with certain Televisions,"This headphone set seemed to work well on one flat panel TV and not at all on another. My Samsung 46"" plasma produced a IFR signal that the headphones picked up as a hiss that drowned out the audio signal. They worked fine behind the TV which made them somewhat useless. They worked with a slight hiss with another smaller 36"" flat pannel TV but I already have a headphone set for that TV."
1,RCA WHP141 900MHZ Wireless Stereo Headphones,"I received these on January 25, 2012 when I opened the box nothing had plastic on it except the batteries that came with them. After putting the batteries into the headphones it didn't work than I tried a brand new pack of batteries it still didn't work. Then I the charger into the wall it didn't work either. I believe this product was used & this is the worst product I brought from Amazon. I am sending them back."
1,"Better than nothing, but not by much.","These headphones have a whine in them. Even with the TV on maximum volume, as other reviewers say. I could live with that for the price, if they also weren't so awkward and uncomfortable. They do not sit on my head well, keep falling off. I am wearing them because I watch TV late at night and try to avoid disturbing my daughter across the hall. So while I am trying to knit, the headphones are falling down. Not cool. I will be sending these back."
2,to much static very poor sound,"Too much static , very poor soundI have to keep my head still to hear.Have tried differ setting or channels but with luck"
5,great hearing without being tied down,got these for a neighbor who is hard of haring. He likes to stay up and his wife eas having difficulty sleeping with the Television on. . . a perfect solution for them !!
4,love them,"I have had them for about 4 years and love them, I love to do my yard work while my jazz is playing."
2,not ready to use,This product can be used if you only want to hear TV yourself. We have had this thing a month and have not been able to find a connector so other people can hear the TV. If the connector is not readily available (and it's not)it should be included in the original purchase.
1,Transmitter did not power on,Transmitter did not power on. The instructions on the manual are not very clear. Had to spend another 17 bucks because my TV does not have analog audio out. I had to bye a 3.55 MM hosa cable and F/F adapter.
5,Worth its money.,My second purchase of RCA WHP141B. The first phones developed static & occasional cutoffs. They originally priced at $99. My second priced at $49. Powered by two AA nicads that can last 8-10 hours on a single charge. Batteries easy to replace if damaged i.e. leaving the charger stand unplugged for too long. Only problem is the loss of audio in one channel Only During long extended music i.e. concerts or loud explosions. It's hardly noticeable & quickly returns channel in a few milliseconds. Best to use pre-amplified fixed audio level from the back of tv or dvd quality power player. In tech terms 1-3 volt peak to peak. Very good wireless transmission range for 900 MHZ. December 2012
1,Didn't work for me,"So I received the package and it seemed like the headphones were repacked. I followed the instructions to the letter and waited more than 24 hours for the batteries to charge. To hear the headphones, the volume on both the headphones and my TV had to be almost completely maximized. In addition, the sound was affected by a hissing feedback. The instruction manual looked very old, ripped, and used."
1,Unbelievably bad,"I've used headphones for years and have owned approximately 4 different brand sets and they've all worked pretty good. This is the first set that I found to be unbelievably bad. I may have simply purchased a bad set because there is alot of static, cracking and popping. The popping is extremely annoying and sometimes painful on the eardrums. Also, the headset sits very loose which is very unusual from all other sets previously owned."
3,Head phones,The head phones did not fit my ears very well and seemed awkward.The sound was OK. but I ended up buying another brand.
3,headphones,first set did not work at all. second set had to much static should have sent them back.would not recommend
2,Hope you have flat ears,"the title kinda says it all, their is no real padding in the ring around the speakers so they're very uncomfortable"
1,Logo Design Studio Pro is worthless,"If I could give it a negative star, I would. I have never purchased a more useless software. There are often problems with the program closing at the most inconvenient times, features not working properly if at all, and problems exporting to other file types.When I finally figured it out enough to design a logo, and believe me, that was no picnic since their support is a two-page-waste-of-paper-and-time piece of instruction, I tried to export to file in order to download for print. The program saved the file in low resolution, regardless of the fact I put higher resolution in the dialog box.I wrote a letter to the company, asking for my money back. Yeah right! No response from them to date. Don't waste your time...even if you could get it free!"
1,This ripoff does not deserve even 1 star,This software is the worst I've ever used. Error messages constantly. Does not export in high resolution for print. Logo designs have dirty backgrounds that are barely usable on web let alone print. No support whatsoever. I've wasted hours trying to get this loser to work. Not even a decent reference online. Total waste of money.
3,Doesn't show very well.,"I took all the measures for best results but it really doesn't show and it starts to fade only a few days after. The ""14"" days that it will take, is a lie. Only remnants of it last that long. The color is very light and takes HOURS for it to have any effect and you have to be extremely careful or it chips off. Really not worth it. Just get a real tattoo or a kids' tattoo. Either of those would do better."
3,Good,"I ordered this just to experiment because it was my first time using henna ever. Overall I like the product the instructions are easy to follow and the designs it comes with are simple but useful if you're a beginner. The only thing I didn't like much was that it doesn't last for a couple weeks in my case it only lasted about 1 week and it fades out very quickly, meaning it only looks good for about 3 or 4 days. I think its a cheap product and you get what you're paying for but if you're looking to do a design for a special event or you want good quality definitely try something else."
4,Good : ),It arrived promptly. It was brand new and very useful. I would definitely recommend it for first time henna users
5,Fantastic!,The kit is incredibly easy to use! My friends and I have had a blast using it. The shipping was very fast too!
4,"Easy to Use, Great Results","This kit simplifies the process of mixing and applying henna tattoos. This particular kit requires no lemon juice or sugar! You pour the bottle of solution into the bag of henna powder, mix it thoroughly, let it sit for 2 hours, then apply. The kit comes with an applicator bottle and tip. I allowed the henna to remain on my skin for 6 hours, which is the minimum recommended time, and it developed into a medium to deep reddish-brown color. This is the darkest color I've ever gotten from using henna kits. The reason I did not give the product a full 5 stars is because the applicator bottle can become tiring for your hands when using it for long periods of time. But the positives of this product outweighs the negatives, and you can always use a different applicator."
4,Very helpful for UK markets,"Comparable to the U.S. ""Writer's Market."" Wish it were available online, though.For UK markets, NOT U.S."
4,It's OK...,"I like most of the songs on this CD. My 5 favorites are: 'Sandstorm', 'Touch Me', 'Better Off Alone', the remix to 'Fill Me In', and 'Silence'. 'Lady', 'Blue', and '9 PM' are really good too. The mixing on this CD is awesome. I gave it a four is because some of the songs on here aren't too hot, nd I dislike Sash and Moloko. The rest of these club classics are good though."
3,Lockhart did not make it seem like an intro text.,"Lockhart is a wonderful researcher, but he may have forgot how to organize content so that introductory students can follow his words. I would not recommend this book for intr classes."
4,a soundtrack for one of those days....,"this film is great - full of quirky smart ass people who just seek to destroy each other, criticize each other, take advantage of each other, and, in their own twisted ways, love each other. the soundtrack perfectly matches the strange, winding story. with songs by nick cave to go along with the main character's strange nick cave look and attitude, lounge music, aussie native snog's background music, and of course, ""the passenger"", this is a great soundtrack that anyone who has ever had a strange, bad day could love...."
2,Great Customer Service!,I received the battery a day or two before it was expected. The battery however failed to work with my laptop even though it was one of the models listed. I informed the company of this and they offered to send out a new one or to issue a refund. I opted for the refund and they sent the cost-free packaging in which I could return the battery and issued the refund soon after. This battery may work for other brands or models but based on my experience I think I'll stick to the original manufacturer.
4,"""When there's Nothing Else to Breathe""","This is NOT the book on Poul Anderson you were looking for. It's not Joshi on Lovecrqaft or Shippey on Tolkien. Anderson's life is only sketched in, and various of his major works not touched upon. (Despite the title, THE HIGH CRUSADE isn't mentioned, for instance.) It's more or less a pamphlet on Anderson's approach to stasis and entropy, which is not a bad way to seeing some of Anderson, but it's not his only theme. Slightly trimmed, I'd have been very pleased to see this in some larger anthology of Poul Anderson criticism.But there is no such anthology. If this theme in early Poul Anderson intrigues you, grab this and wait for better times."
3,Not Swift as a Wolf,The 600 pages contain a lot of boring stuff about the politics and genealogy of mythical kingdoms. In places the sentence structure is shaky. The parts about the wolf are interesting and believeable. If only the good stuff wasn't buried.
2,Badly needs editing and focus,"I'm a fan of Lindskold's earlier books, and expected this 550+-page to be perfect long-weekend reading material. But it's without focus (too many charactors and plotlines and you never know which ones the story is really about), without rythmn (the author stops action near the very end of the book to detail a tertiary charactor's genealogy for several pages) and without specific detail (behaviour, morality, religion, architecture, you name it) that would make anyone believe they are in another world (aside from very general, this is a vaguely medieval court stuff.)I expected a book focused on a feral child learning human ways. I got a sub-standard monarchy-succession intrigue.With a tight edit, this could have been turned into an ok-enough book on any one of the many characters. Without it, it's a messy bore."
2,Promising concept poorly executed,"The book description drew me to the Firekeeper series but sadly after finishing Through Wolf's Eyes and half of Wolf's Head, Wolf's Heart I must say that it has disappointed me. I found most of the characters shallow, unengaging and difficult to empathize with. I just couldn't get the drawn in feeling that I look for in a fantasy novel. My favorite fantasy authors are George Martin, Robert Jordan and Robin Hobb. After having spent most of the last year reading their work this series felt like a nosedive."
3,"Promising Author, Disappointing Book","I am always excited to find a new scifi/fantasy author, and had high hopes when I picked up THROUGH WOLF'S EYES. It is a big, fat novel I hoped to lose myself in.However, I was disappointed. Perhaps THROUGH WOLF'S EYES would have been better if a good editor had cut this down considerably. I found that thr book slowed down considerably about halfway through. The intrigue, once Firekeeper arrives at court, just seemed ponderous to me. It was not badly written, but the book kept getting left on my bedside table while I went to find something more engaging to read. The intrigue in THROUGH WOLF'S EYES just did not have the page-turning quality required when the plot and cast get so large and convoluted.Perhaps I should try the novel again sometime, and I may do so. There was enough promise in THROUGH WOLF'S EYES that I will almost certainly try another book by Lindskold."
1,you've got to be kidding,"This is not about the product, but about the vendor, and AMAZONs lack of customer service/satisfaction. The product was ordered correctly, as shown, yet we recieved the wrong color. In trying to return the product, and exchange, etc... we hit brick wall after brick wall. No one would step up and fix this. We finally contacted our credit card company to get our money back. This whole experience has left me with an extreamly sour taste for Amazon, and I will most likely not purchase anything from them again."
2,Should have listened to the reviews not the author,"Although there is a lot of great information in this book along with a plethora of schematics (Which I cannot read), I found the other reviews to be spot on. The book is a thrown together outline of the Fender revolution and then there is a copy of the Trainwreck manual thrown in the middle of the book (which looks photo copied) and it ends with a guide to buying what else, but Kendrick amps. Therefore I agree it with the other post that the book is disorganized and thrown together. Furthermore it does not get into the basic of what and amp is and the architecture of the stages."
2,Bead chain Necklace review,"Overall I am not staisfied with this product.Pros:Shipped promptly from vendorMade of silver as advertised.Cons:Clasp is junk, bad design and poorly made broke the first time used.Vendor would not exchange or refund."
5,Awesome game.,This game is an awesome WW2 game. This game is very fun to play. I probably like medal of honor better though.
5,A Great WW2 Game!,"I bought this a few weeks ago and I've loved every minute of playing it. Some people may argue that it has crappy graphics, but having Playstation I have learned to live with it, even though the graphics are fine with me. I love when you hit someone with a grenade, you see limbs flying everywhere. Wait! Hidden and Dangerous is calling me. I have to go!"
1,Couldn't grind Air,"One of the biggest wastes of money this year. Bought this to grind fresh corn grown in my garden. Attempted using this and it does not work. Finally ended up using coffee grinder to get the job done. 70 bucks down the drain.. trust the negative reviews on this one, the positive ones are probably from the vendor."
5,grain mill,So far I have thouroughly enjoyed the grain mill and it works wonderfully. The company that I deealt with was excellent as well though I don't remember which it was they were very professional.
1,grain mill broke after 6 months,I really enjoyed this grain mill for the short time it was in service. It broke after 6 months and spun around uselessly but would not mill the grain. I can't recommend this device.
3,"Prepares you for the test, but very dry","I want to start off by saying that I did not pass the test on the first try. It was more difficult than I expected and the book definately led me in the right direction. But it was hard to read the book. No graphics, no real font change and sometimes far too technical for someone who does not know Linux itself all that well.In conclusion, it will help out if you have a firm grasp of how Linux works 'under the hood' already, because the book does not do such a good job there, but the details on what to expect in the exam, it does a better job. Give this book a shot if you study alongside Steve Shah's Linux Administration. Both together do more justice.With this book alone, I failed the exam of with 58 points."
3,"Fair, but not great book.","This book covers many of the basics that you need for the test, but far more information is needed to pass the test. This book, like many of the Sair books follows the Test Matrix for chapter layout, Which tend to make the book jump around and repeat itself."
1,lost in space,"An ultramontanist friend gave me a copy of this to read, apparently in the hope that it would quell all the questions I have about the Magisterium's long, dreadful retreat from Vatican II.It didn't. Frankly, I find it almost impossible to read.I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer who says the book shows a clear disconnect with reality.A much better book, in my opinion, is Philip S. Kaufman's ""Why You Can Disagree--And Remain a Faithful Catholic""."
4,great for moving freely around office,"I really like using this wireless, handset it allows me to be wherever I need to be in the office and still pick up the phone, i have a small buzz sound on my end but i'm sure it is some little adj i have overlooked, will probably buy one for others in the office in future."
4,HeaDSET,"The price was incredible. I has used this product at a prior job and was the first thing I purchased for my new position. I find them indispensable.Fast delivery, great product...what more is there to say."
5,What the other guy said... But shorter...,"I got this book the other night. Having seen Hilmann speak at several events I had been anticipating the arrival for some time. I wasn't disappointed.The goals set out at the beginning of the book are admirably achieved, taking you on a journey through your own mind on the way. Probably the most well written book on the elusive subject of new media processes, inspiration and project management (in the literal sense). I totally recommend this book for anyone who has ever considered what and why we do the things we do in this strange business we call Interactive design.A serious book for professionals."
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"Do we really need another book on how this guy designs things? Do we really need the constant name dropping of all the people he has worked with, met, or is inspired by? For someone who claims they are influenced by a variety of sources, why can I immediately pick out a work by Hillman Curtis? The purpose of good design is to give your client an identity of THEIR OWN. This rule also applies for Juxt Interactive. (Just one of the many names dropped throughout the book.) Save your money and time. Self serving, self congratulatory, name dropping books like this will hardly make you a better designer. Hard work, innovative thinking, and books by the masters of design will put you on the right path."
1,Worthless!,Self appointed maestro trys to teach common sense! If you don't inherently know this then you probably have no business being in this business!
4,"Very recommended, lots of insight about creative practice","I'm just starting to learn about design, reading online and checking some books at the library of my college. This book is a great help because it does tell you the key fact that all ideas are there, borrowing is ok to transform something into a new well crafted thing,and you can find inspiration in many, many ways. Many useful information, tips, quotes, in general, I'm gonna buy this book for my collection."
2,Good for a Gravy!,"The main ingredient should be SALT! 750mg per serving and there are 2 servings per can. Come on, we usually sweat or need more salt in the Summer, but we tend to eat more soup in the Winter. My first impression was ""boy this is salty"". It would be great as a gravy but so is a much cheaper Cambell's cream of mushroom."
1,Hannibal: Master of the Beast,"At first I was hopefull that the game would have some potential. I found out from testing the game battle system that it was poorly designed and got the same results every time, I lost half my army every time! I had double number of troops and my Cavalry was 10 times there number plus 58 elephants. Very very disappointed after the test results! Some one tried to sell me this game for $25.00 plus shipping on E-Bay,!I'm luck to have found the game on Amazon the same game which I purchased it for alot less. :-) The game was in good shape so no complate there and it arrieved in a timely manner."
1,This Game is a waste of $,"It was a waste of time, after you hook the fish they dont try to escape, they sit there so you can reel them in. You will quickly get bored with this game."
5,Apartment House Wrestling in HUGE pictures!,"Even though Theo Eret may not appreciate his own photos, they formed the foundation of what would become known as Apartment House Wrestling, an idea and a look that took hold of me and never let me go. If you have fond memories of those matches from the pages of Sports Review Wresting, or liked to buy from Triumph Studios, this is an absolute treasure trove of images. Strangely, a bunch of pro-wrestling images are also included, seemingly at random. Plus, without the text of the matches or showing images in progression, a lot of the emotional impact is lost. (They truly had an amazing writer coming up with those matches in SRW!) But those are the only downsides. This book is the best piece of apartment house wrestling I've ever purchased, and I am thrilled to have found it."
4,QUE BUENO,LES RECOMIENDO ESTE DISCO YA QUE LO ESCUCHE POR MEDIO DE UN AMIGO Y ESTA GENIAL COMO TODO LO QUE HACE LAURA......
5,"Finally, a good rock band...","Mustasch is the type of band that somehow manages to fly under the radar of most rock fans. A well oiled and seasoned rock machine that knows how to create a music both heavy and rockin' without sounding like no one else. Their main influence must be Black Sabbath, some of their riffs sound like Iommi's melodic bests yet their sound is original yet familiar.Songs like Life on Earth sound doomy yet compelling and both Frosty White and Powerhouse start hard turning melodic during the chorus but never missing their heaviness. Singles Dogwash and I'm Alright will make you grab your air guitar to shred like crazy.Overall a great hard hittin' rock record by an amazing band, be sure to check all of their albums if you like me miss a good rocking band."
2,Lame,"This is a pretty lame album. The tune about jazz musicians, ""Jazz Guy,"" is a slam against jazz musicians, not a salute to jazz musicians, as the Amazon review states.This album pales in comparison to their other albums."
3,It's OK,"I was a little disappointed, it wasn't made very well. However, for the price it's pretty good."
4,Great for Grandma!,"I bought this for my mom and put pictures of her 4 grandchildren, and 2 daughters in it. She loves it! The pictures are very small... I recommend using a very close-up shot of a face."
5,Number One Read for this Child Psychiatrist MOM of Preschoolers,"Fabulous Read, with most Awesome and Engaging pictures...as you can hunt for words and 'the hidden' in the very beautiful, colorful well-depicted illustrations!!!! Loved by both my 2 yr. old and 4 yr. old sons...most repetitively read now as their ""fav"" request...and to think that not too long ago it was ""Goodnight Moon""--but not anymore!!!! As a Child Psychiatrist and a Mom it is hard to find a great book that holds the attention span like this awesome book does so very well..... & the most colorful, bold illustrations have been so special for my slightly visually impaired 2 yr. old in bifocals...and the 4 yr. old is fascinated by ""the hidden words"" and is trying to learn some Hawaiian words........A TRUE MUST HAVE BOOK FOR THE PRE-SCHOOL AND EARLY ELEMENTARY SET"
2,Not the Best,"This screen does not offer enough privacy. This is more of a blur screen. It easy to discern what is on the screen. Although peeping eyes may not be able to read the screen, they can definitely tell what is on the screen- work or play. This is not the best privacy screen; However the price from Amazon Merchant, Discount Office Supplies, was the lowest I've EVER seen for a privacy screen. And shipping was so fast, less than two days."
4,Titleist Pro V1 AAA Recycled Golf Balls,Great value. I play 3-4 times a week and have always used Titleist golf balls. Even the logo balls were in good shape.
3,Good but there are better options,I purchased the 36 ball pack. What I thought would be 2010 Pro V1's were more like 2008 or older pro v1's. There were some good ones but most were not grade B in my opinion. Knetgolf.com has a better selection of used pro v1's.
3,Okay,These balls are a little more scuffed than I would prefer. They are not repainted so they show some discoloration. I think I can do better for my money.
3,Pro Vi AAA Recycled Golf Balls,I have enjoyed playing with the balls that I ordered but some of the balls do not have the oomph that others have. Maybe they are older or have been through some difficult temperatures. Newer balls have better distance.
2,Crap,"I'd say only about half are what I'd call AAA mint balls, the rest were practice balls at best. Won't buy again."
5,Pretty Willie is Suella,"The first song I heard from his CD was ""Designer Love,"" and it was when my cousin bumped it in his car. I was curious who sang it and my cousin said that it was Pretty Willie. I was like the hell is that. But I love the song so much that I went out and copped the entire CD just for that song. Little did I know this guy had an entire collection of songs that I felt should of been hits. Pretty Willie deserves much more attention in the music industry. This guy is tight with his smooth rhymes and beats. All I can say is buy this CD and tell your friends about 'um because they'll like him too!"
3,Pretty Willie Concert,"I had never heard of Pretty Willie before I moved to Jackson, MS. My boyfriend took me to see him in concert on Valentine's Day 2004 at Freelon's. I really enjoyed his performance and now I play his songs all day. I have even told some of my friends about him in Memphis and they have starting listening to his songs."
4,A must have for trance lovers and oakenfold fans!!,"i thought that this cd was awesome! i like it better than tranceport and it sounds a bit newer. the first cd is great; especially towards the end, starting with ""everytime"" by lustral. there is a little dreamy breakbeat on the second disk, and it is just as good as the first one. if you want to hear music so good your body can barely handle it, this is it. the only thing better would be to hear it spun live! i've listened to it over and over again."
3,mediocre sound quality and a battery eater,"They are weak in the high frequency range.They require a lot of power to drive them. I have to change the batteries on my Rio500 MP3 player every 6 hours instead of the 13 hours advertised. I know it's the headphones because I have to turn my MP3 player's volume almost to the max when using them, but need only 25% of the volume for other headphones.The volume control is very handy though."
2,Fits well but sound is well....,"Ok the thing is is that they really do fit well. BUT! The sound is reversed, the instromentals (spelling?) are put louder and the vocals are bearly there. and i know that the tape was working so... don't get it though it's not very good at all."
1,Waste of Postage,"If you're looking for a good pair of headphones, look elsewhere. Not only are these uncomfortable wear, the sound quality isn't all that great either. Plus they broke within a month of first use."
1,misleading product,The battery I ordered was different than the one I received. I bought this battery thinking I would receive a battery that matched the product numbers and picture. It did not. The battery I received was totally different than the picture and the numbers that were described. Amazon told me to return it and reorder it and it would be right. I did and it was not. Dekcell is sending the wrong battery and Amazon is not correcting the problem.
2,Grass Hopper,"Somehow I missed the debut of this book, even though Ruth Rendell is one of my most favorite writers. This book was a big disappointment. Mostly I resent that it led me along by the nose, leaking tiny whiffs of intrigue without ever delivering in a satisfactory style. Manipulation of the reader does not a good mystery make! Is B. Vine losing her touch after so many wonderful, unique plots under either name? This one seemed to be an attempt at a formula without any passion. I completed it but was relieved to close the cover. The final page is the only reason I rate it as a 2 instead of a 1! I'll be cautious and read lots of reviews before picking up another B. Vine book!"
2,Disappointing introduction to Barbara Vine,"This is my first Barbara Vine book. I struggled to read it to the end although I early on lost interest in the characters and the story. I had hoped it would pick up as I went along, but it didn't. I don't know if I'll attempt to read another of her books or not."
1,Unrealistic and totally boring,"What happened to Barbara Vine? None of the characters in Grasshopper ring true and the climbing episodes are so repetitive that you feel like throwing this book thru your window, far over the roofs, never to see it again."
2,A true rarity...a dull Barbara Vine novel,"Do not, and I repeat, do not judge Barbara Vine/Ruth Rendell by this novel. Under both names, she has created truly superior mystery and suspense fiction. She writes an average of two books a year and hardly ever misfires. Unfortunately, this one is a misfire. The characters are not interesting and at times are even annoying. The story proceeds slowly with a lot of foreshadowing that fails to be fulfilled. I repeat, this author is one of the absolute best. This book just plain is not representative."
2,The Strawberry Tea,"This Tea is just the best ever. I originally bought this tea in London, I struggled to find it here. Until I found it on Amazon. I have had a subscription for about a year now. The only problem is that the last 2 shipments have been for Strawberry Sensation and not for the Original Strawberry they are both good but I prefer the Strawberry. DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO CONTACT AMAZON REGARDING THIS CONCERN? I wouldn't mind having a subscription for both, but amazon.com doesn't have the option for the Strawberry Sensation and it's shipping me the wrong type of tea. DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO CONTACT AMAZON REGARDING THIS CONCERN?"
4,Top notch Cheesecloth,"Every year, we end up with an excess of bees wax pieces and cuttings from our hives. We found wrapping these bits and pieces of wax (and an assortment of bee parts) in cheesecloth. Heating this these up in a microwave melts the wax and it flows out through the cheesecloth - leaving behind the bug parts.This particular cheesecloth fit the bill quite nicely."
3,"it is intuitive, but beware - there is no manual","It is pretty easy to use, so you probably won't need one. I called them to assist me in finding it on the program disk, and they confirmed that it wasn't there. The help tips can be a little frustrating because navigating through all the stuff you don't need takes time, and I prefer to read the book first and attack later. The program is solid however for making sub-professional looking labels and importing graphics from scanners, DV fire wire, or the Internet."
3,Killer...,Used in class to illustrate the power of volcanoes and the uncertainty associated with predictions. The video is good - but a bit too long and over done in the dramatics.
3,Disappointing,"I felt that Naomi Wolf's book was an autobiography, not a deep analysis of the ""secret struggle"" of women. Her attempts at some historical analysis of women's sexuality seemed to be misplaced in the book. If she was trying to make a comparison to her friends' sexual lives to history, she should have had more historical analysis included throughout her book. I feel thatauthors such as Susie Bright, Carol Queen, and Pat Califia write much better on women's sexuality issues from a feminist standpoint."
5,"A great value, if you have enough RAM and a fast hard disk","I had none of the problems described in some of the reviews, although the frame grabbing tool wouldn't work consistently. I am happy to say that Pinnacle fixed this issue and others with release 1.05, which you can download as a patch from their website. With this issue resolved, I can say that this product is quite a bargain and has helped me create simple, high-quality videos very easily. HOWEVER, firewire video editing only works well when you have plenty of RAM (128mb seems about right) and a fast hard disk (most newer UDMA's work just fine)."
2,Item not as described,"Was excited to receive this item just in time for my dinner party, but much to my disappointment, there was a dent in the lower rim which impeded the removable bottom from seating properly. On top of that, it was only 9.5 inches, not the 10.25 they claim it to be. I did read that this happened to someone else, but hoped I would get the correct item. I was very disappointed and returned the item. Beware this seller."
3,History in History,"Saw how great the reviews were for the entire trilogy and decided to start here. It gets funny because at some point while you're reading you realize its a non fiction history book about writing a non fiction history book, if that makes any sense. However, the themes and overall scope of the book is very unique and refreshing. Lots of mystery with not a whole lot of action."
5,One to read and re-read,"The first McDevitt book I read was ""Engines of God""; the second was ""A Talent for War."" Like Hrinwar (if you read ""Talent"" you'll know where his post name comes from), this is a book to be read and re-read every year or so. Personally, I've worn through several volumes or lost them as loaners and am now getting this book on Kindle to go to whenever I desire.Even if you're not a science fiction devotee, this book is special.The telling of this story from an archeologist's point of view doesn't convey its power and a summary of the plot or criticism of his characters doesn't do this book justice. The history that Alex Benedict discovers and the characters that come through most strongly are all dead in Alex Benedict's time. The discovery that Alex Benedict finally makes will haunt you as it does him."
3,Eh,"Having read most of McDevitt's books and seeing good reviews of this one, I expected a lot more. The basic mystery is exceedingly drawn out, and in the end the resolution is lost in the shuffle of the tediously described travels of the main character. A good premise poorly executed. Not a bad book, but overrated and a disappointment."
3,A Talent For Being A Bit Dated,"This is the first book that I've just finished by Mr. McDevitt, and I was feeling that it's internal structure feels a bit dated. Luckily I'm reading his ""Engines Of God"" and that book is much better. I'm unsure if I should read the second book of this series."
1,P-U,"This ball stinks, literally! I kept this ball inflated and OUTSIDE for at least a week and a half and I washed it as well and it still stinks! Plus I got it in grey--you should give the customer the choice of color. I was thinking I was getting the color blue, which is pictured on the box, upon ordering."
2,Flimsy ball,"I was looking for an exercise ball to add to my trampoline workout. SPRI was a good brand that I have purchased several other items from to get professional quality products. I was very disappointed with how flimsy this ball is. It is a soft, lightweight gauge that doesn't feel sturdy enough to support any weight and it squishes down too much."
1,Be careful! This may not be what you need!,"This book does NOT include the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005! This book was not right for my Debtor-Creditor class. This book only covers current law before the new Act takes affect on Oct. 17th, 2005. Ask your professor to be sure. In my opinion, the 2005 year on the cover of the book seemed misleading."
2,MR DOCTOR SOLD OUT !!,"I was very dissapointed when I first heard this cd !!! I'm a big mr. doc fan for years now, but this album has nothin to do with the mr. doc I know !!! His beats sound like commercial eastcoast beats and the features of 50cent and Jay-Z are just for tha chedda !!! my opinion mr. doc sold out !!!"
2,disappointing,"I found this product to be overpriced. 108 pie weights are not as many as you would think -- they barely covered a 9"" pie dish. Perhaps it was my mistake but I was very disappointed."
1,GOT MOLDY!,"The first few times I used them, they were fine.The container was worthless to store them in but not a big deal. However, I used them at Christmas, washed/cleaned afterwards per instructions and then I took them out to use today and noticed they were fuzzy. On closer inspection they had GROWN MOLD on their ceramic surfaces! We don't even live in a humid area. I would say don't buy these, invest in something more expensive, like a pie chain. Lesson learned."
5,Ingenious Knowledge,"In this small book Szekely gave me a method of study that I wish I had learnt a long time ago. He provided very important knowledge on the relationship between thought, feelings, and actions (as well as memory) with Creative Imagination providing the link between thoughts and feelings. The approach that he recommends is an active and engaging approach."
4,A Great Golf Game,"This is a very fun golf game. If you own a NGPC and like golf, I would definitely recommend this game. The only thing that I find frustrating is at times it can be difficult to read the greens when putting. Aside from this, the game is very enjoyable and will keep you coming back for more to win the tripple crown and collect your special prize."
4,a great golf game,"I found turf masters to be very entertaining if you like golf. the controls are easy, the graphics are nice, and you'll probably find yourself playing it for hours. It has several levels of difficulty from easy to very hard. It also keeps records of all your players stats. My only complaint is the number of courses, although three courses are satisfying I would like to have seen more. This game is a must have for the golfer in you."
4,Good value,"Ease of use 10, Sound 9, Transport 8, Look 8, Feel 9, Features 9, Mechanical functions are very noisey."
2,Mixed,"Arrives timely but some bottles have capsules that are broken open and have the herb powder ""leaking"" out, I have even had an empty capsule in one bottle."
5,Good for Uromastyx,"I have a 12-year-old Uromastyx Ornata. 2-3 times a week he gets fresh food (greens, peas, etc.) The other days he has a bowl of this Rep-Cal Iguana Food.I can't comment on the taste, but for some reason he likes the red food best. He'll pick all of the red kibble out and only eat the other colors when the red is gone. I use this as ""proof"" that he can see colors.Recommended for Uromastyx. I don't know about Iguanas."
1,Severely Disappointed,I just returned this item. I began to notice it skipping. It seems to skip after the first couple of tracks. At first I thought it was one particular CD but it happens on all sorts of discs. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to it.I'm getting the Yamaha 5-disc unit instead. I had a Yamaha and was always impressed with the sound. You get CD's because of the nice sound so why settle for less. The sound quality of the JVC wasn't up to the Yamaha's (it sounded a bit muddy) but for $100 less I was willing to live with it. Now I'm going back for both quality and sound.
1,It came BROKEN!,"We bought this new off Amazon and when it arrived it wouldn't read CDs. It's been in the shop for a few weeks now and I have no idea when we'll get it fixed. It is under warranty, but this is ridiculous!"
1,Horrible!!!!,"This is by far the worst MFP I have ever owned. As mentioned by many others it's loud. The printing is average at best. Worst of all the ink is expensive. You can't refill the cartridges with ink because it will not recognize the cartridge as being full. So basically, you are buying a disposable printer. When the ink runs out buy a new printer--it's cheaper."
5,Mick Farren,"Buy this book and all other Mick Farren novels. You will not be disappointed. From the time I first picked up an out of print copy of ""Feelies"" in a used book store a dozen years ago, I have found Mick Farren to be the most creative, original, and unique writer since Jerzy Kozinski. This novel is another great read. Given the talent of this writer, I am in shock that in all these years I have never seen any main stream bookstores carry even a single copy of his work. I don't know how he got blacklisted, but I will buy every book Mick Farren writes. ""Conflagration"" is as fresh and entertaining as it gets. Thank you Mick."
1,"Reviewer:Fred Dickmann - ""70 Ounces Of Gold""","I am extremely disappointed with this CD. This piece is misrepresented on the cover as containing ""the original tracks"", but only two or three cuts are the original recordings. If you're into RE-RECORDINGS, you will accept this album-otherwise don't waste your time."
3,"Good for history, not really a ""How To"" book.","I purchased this book used. This little book has some very good examples of middle age and later wood engravings and covers the history of the wood engraving well. Good color plates too. It has some pictorial info about how wood engravings are made, but is not really a detailed how to book. If you want to know the history of wood engravings and are interested in knowing how they are made, this is a great book, however if you are looking for a how to book or guide on making your own wood engravings, this is not the one."
4,Did it's job-sort of,"I have a lot of 9 inch pie pans and this was a little big for them....but it covered most of the crust. It does smoosh the crust, so if you want a ""pretty"" crust, this will not work for you. Overall, if left on the entire baking time the crust comes out only a little darker than the rest of the pie crust."
5,Perfect Crust Every time,This is SO much easier to use than tin foil and keeps my pie crusts from getting burnt every time! It is a MUST have!
3,Size matters!,"This is a nice aluminium shield and i liked how it looks and feels (somehow reminds the oldfashioned foil shield). However, the size information is not precise. It is NOT 10.5 inch, as the product discription has it. So it didn't fit my 10.2 inch pie pan. Actually the exact size of this shield IS 10.2 inch. It almost fits, but it doesn't. Wish i could ask before and didn't rely upon product info"
4,Excellent leadership tool,Mr. Cottrell leads us on a stimulating journey through our team members world. This book has had a profound impact on our organization!
3,I liked the ReNu Multi-Purpose Solution but only ...,I liked the ReNu Multi-Purpose Solution but only as a reserve if I don't have my regular solution on hand. The advantage over similar products is that my eyes don't sting after inserting my contacts like they do with some solutions. The disadvantage is that I felt my contacts weren't as clean and my vision wasn't as sharp as when using another brand. I would recommend buying a small bottle to try out first before spending extra money on the larger size.
1,Beware when using this foot.,"I thought I would like this as opposed the typical universal style Free Motion(FM) foot with the springs and such that hops all over the place. And honestly, I did! When I first used it instead of my usual FM foot, I loved how much easier it was to see and maneuver my quilt while working. However after using this foot to FMQ one twin sized quilt, I discovered that the bar on the foot rubbed my needleclamp so badly that it actually wore a deep groove into it!!!! I was astonished and disappointed to say the least! Beware of the way this foot rubs on the needleclamp of your machine as it goes up and down, you will end up with a groove in it that isn't supposed to be there!"
2,The tape transport is a piece of junk.,"This is a nice sounding deck, but the tape transport is cheap and unreliable. I had mine for about a year, and the left well started eating tapes. I finally took it to a repair shop. When I got it back it worked for a week then it ate one of my favorite tapes. I would not recommend this deck."
1,TOTALLY DISSATSFIED,"I had previously owned a Teac dual casset player/recorder for twenty years and was very satisfied with it. When it finally broke I decided to purchase another. Upon reciept of the new recorder I proceeded to try all functions of the machine. When I tried to record from a CD or another casset the results was garbled noise. I'm sure that this was not the norm for Teac equipment,but I returned the merchandise and ordered the more expensive Denon. Hopefully this recorder will last far more than twenty years."
2,LCD screen cracked.,"I had this camera for about a month and the first time it broke, I don't know why it broke. I set it down and when I turned it back on, it had cracked. I then bought another LCD screen and repaired it myself, but two weeks later, I had a CASE for it, and put it in my purse. I carried my purse around and had not set my purse down. When I took it out, it had cracked again. I would not recommend getting this camera."
4,Decent starter digital camera,"Pretty good digital camera for basic point-and-shoot and family/party photographs. It is small and cute, but equally fragile .Expect a large drop in picture quality when the flash is removed."
3,Detective light,"This is an agreeable enough mystery series but by no means on the level of Gently, Morse, Frost, or Foyle. The budget is low, the moving transportation scenes are obvious padding, the wit is very slight, and the major character, fat enough to sink a ship, is unconvincing as a policeman. Perhaps foodies would enjoy this series more than anyone else.In short, not bad. Okay. Mediocre. Beats watching game shows."
1,I found it absolutely impossible to use this ...,"I found it absolutely impossible to use this cream. It was very difficult to control the amount that came out. When it finally did come out, it snaked around the nozzle of the tube, and was almost impossible to get off the tube and into my eye. It was essentially a lump of Vaseline. All in all, a total bust. I asked my husband to try it since he also uses drops for dry eyes, but he found it so impossible to use, he gave up before actually using it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
5,Health! Health! Health!,"Who said exercise is easy? I've just finished the workout and I feel great! I had a hip operation 7 weeks ago and haven't had any aerobics since. Before my surgery I was swimming for 40-60 minutes a day. So I was starting to feel yucky, depressed. Nikki is a good teacher, energetic, and easy to follow.Sometimes I couldn't keep up with her. No problem. I just did what I could. Nevertheless I got a good workout and am ready to face the day with energy."
3,I goofed. I thought I was getting chair yoga.,"I am not a fan of aerobics, It seems more about co ordination than exercise. If you like aerobics you might like this. It is for those who want to get their heart pumping, but for some reason can not stand very long. I only did this for 15 min and it got very repetitive for me.She has a man and an older lady do the workout with her. I had to laugh at the expression on the older ladies face during one exercise . She was obviously having a struggle with it. I also got amused because they moved into the shade."
2,Don't use if you are recovering from injury,"This dvd was not meant for those just starting to get into shape or trying to get back in shape after recovering from something like knee injuries. On the modified movements, you really cannot see them very well. If you are confined to a chair, you cannot do a lot of the exercises. After trying this video once, you may be want to give up. Not very inspiring if you cannot do the standing exercises. Read the dvd descriptions carefully if you are seeking seated only exercises. There are other dvds in this series (Chair Aerobics for Everyone) that are completed seated."
3,Not for those completely confined to a chair!!!,"I bought this DVD so I could do some kind of activity after my foot surgery--not a good idea. Although it made me work up a sweat, it hurt my foot and some of the exercising has you standing. I don't think ""chair aerobics"" is an appropriate name for it. It's a bit misleading. I'm unable to flex or point my foot and the instructor in this video is VERY high energy. The gentleman and the senior lady in the video both seem to have a tough time keeping up with her."
3,Good workout,"The exercises work pretty well for my wife since she has bad knees and hips. The presentation in not very exciting, but the exercises provide a good workout."
4,Good value,Takes some care and caution to get good results. Instructions could be a little better. It does though result in a good edge
5,Wonderful!,"This is a wonderful knife sharpener; I'm very impressed. I've been a stickler for sharp knives all my life, yet had fallen by the wayside due to the ""no time!"" syndrome.A few minutes per knife with this thing returned them all to razor sharpness, and 60 seconds per knife keeps them sharp. It even made our one cheapo knive, normally relegated to the back of the drawer, masquerade as a surgical instrument ready to tackle tough-skinned tomatoes.Highly recommended."
5,chef's choice 110 knife sharpener,We got the product in a timely manner. When we got it we immediately tried it out. My husband is a chef and all of his knives are professional grade. They were really dull since we hadn't had them sharpened in awhile. It didn't take long to figure out how the sharpener worked with the information that was with it. Now we have to watch our fingers the sharpener is the best. It is easy to use and it only takes moments to sharpen our knives I would recommend this product to anybody that is looking for a great shapener and does a great job.
4,Good Job,"This knife sharpener is very nice, it does sharpen knives as good as advertised, I am happy with the results."
1,"Hated it, threw it away and learned how to use real hones","Get a couple of good hones instead and learn to use them. I got one of these a couple of years ago. I figured I would now enter ""easy sharp knife heaven"", but it ruined all my knives. They are sharp, but only kind of sharp. It ground the bevels to flat and I never managed to get anything that was remotely razor sharp, and trust me, I have tried. Anyhone who says razor sharp, doesn't really mean razor razor sharp or may never have seen a really sharp knife. If it isn't as sharp as that scalpel you used in biology class, it is not razor sharp.I recently bought the book Razor Edge sharpening, and a couple of Razor Edge hones and hand reground all the knives I had ruined (doesn't take long if you do it right, even form a destroyed edge). Now I finally have the ultra scalpel sharp knives I always wanted. So sharp it is almost scary. Good hones aren't cheap either, but you can use them for your other tools too, like chisels, etc."
3,Adequate but I've bought better,"I bought one a little while ago (2/06). It does the job but seems chintzy, compared to the Sony I had before. The right hand well is noisy which is a drag since the deck is right next to me as I listen/record. I do like that it has a pitch control (on deck 1 only) but wish it had a time counter rather than an index counter. It also has rotating heads which is just plain bad engineering. There is no need for that. I don't expect this unit to last long with rotating heads but there are so few dual well decks that record on both wells, this will have to do for now. It is also noisy as it reverses direction (heads rotating) and as it plays/records."
3,missing part,just to let you know I was not a happy customer. There was a part missing. My son had to go to bike shop and purchase it. I did not want to send it back because we didn't know how long the process would take. It was a piece to secure the back tire on. well you wanted to know Thanks
2,Trailer Dolly - Made in China - Not as functional as I had hoped,"Made in China. Bolts/nuts would not tighten without stripping. Had to use my own bolts & nuts instead. Also, Cotter Pins to hold wheels on were omitted. Had to use own. Ball was low to ground. Had to jack trailer down to it. Not very manageable in grass. CVF did, however, take it back and give me a full refund, including original and return shipping costs. Great Customer Service."
4,Informative and Interesting,"'The Road from Coorain' was a very interesting book and I thought it was well written. I found Jill Ker Conway's account of Australia's outback, cities, schooling and history very interesting and informative. I learned much from this book. It was intriguing to see how British history and the influence of the British formed the dynamics of Australia. There are areas in this book that are on the dry side and I did skim a few parts, but overall this book is very interesting."
4,colonial / immigrant worldview parallels,"This book delivers a fascinating account of a fragile ecosystem and an equally fragile human society dependent on it. Jill Ker's coming of age is put into a societal and ecological context, which stimulates my curiosity about Australia and her other works. Her outside look at the ""colonial mentality"" resonates with my own immigrant's view of the cultures where I have lived, and raises interesting societal questions applicable not only to Australia. ""The Road from Coorain"" is a fast read despite longer descriptive passages, and I highly recommend it."
4,Enjoyed it beginning to end,"I found her story interesting and well written. I was interested in the culture and geography of Australia, as well as her story of finding her way in life. I quickly connected with her, and found her writing to be clear and honest. Contrary to what others may have said about this author, she had a tough childhood and adolescence, but thrived in spite of it."
1,My mother's dead so I can trash the old broad!,"If the poor woman isn't dead yet, then reading this ditty of a book will surely kill her. The first part describing the outback was great. As the book progresses it gets boring. I haven't skipped through so many pages in a book since I had to read about the Phoenicians in high school! This is a fine example of academic reading, ie has no direct practical application."
3,Part I Interesting. Part II Boring,Jill Conway's childhood in Outback Australia is interesting and unique - what other autobiography can you remember with this topic? However when her family relocates back into civilization her story is conventional and frequently tedius.
5,Best one since Trials of Death,I really liked this book in the series. Darren Shan is living with Harkat Mulds and Mr Crepsly in a town where there is a (or maybe more than one) vampaneze killing the people in the town.I liked it because Darren has to go back to school and also because three charactors from earlier books in the series returned so it had a similar feel to the first few books in the series. One of the best so far in my opinion.
3,This album doesn't show off Steve's usual electricity,"For the most part I was disappointed by this album. I wanted another Natural Timbre and got a less that thrilling work by a man who usually delivers. It's true this album has many styles, as Steve Howe says in the album liner, ""combining...rock and roll, the blues and later jazz... to explore how progressive rock developed its own personality."" however I don't think he was very successful at conveying how wonderful these Elements can be."
5,Beautiful desserts the easy way,This pan is so easy to use and produces gorgeous results. I just spray it with Pam and everything I bake comes out easily. The shape makes for very easy slicing. A favorite recipe is a healthy graham cracker crust with yogurt cheese filling and fresh berries - looks so beautiful the family has no idea they're eating healthy. I wasn't sure I'd use it much but have been using it at least once or twice a week and even ordered a second pan to accommodate larger groups. A reasonably priced great addition to my bakeware.
2,Mech Tommy 20 Dart Blaster,My son really wanted this from Santa. It is pretty much a flop. The darts get jammed and there is a lot of time needed to reset the system.
4,Tommy 20 Review overal,"Well, i haven't gotton this gun yet, but plan on for Christmas, and trust me on this review, i have done my research. Cons, this gun is noisy because of the motor, so u can forget about stealth, but who wants to do that when u have a fully auto?? Also,this gun holds 20 darts, so when your barrel is empty, RUn for cover!!!! The good things, r that you can either single-shot this gun, in other words, however fast u can pull the trigger, and has an rapid-fire action, so u will win the War. I will write back when i get this weapon, and look forward to the future wars i shall conquer with my Mech Tommy 20!!! =)"
1,unsatisfied,I was so happy to see it when it got to my house and when I tried to shoot it it wouldn't fire at all.overall I woudn't recommend buying this toy.I would recommend the auto tommy 20.I once tried it at my friend's house and it had no problems.Buzz Bee Auto Tommy 20 Dart Blaster
3,Informative,"This book gives a rare chronological history of how important the beaver was to relationships between France, Spain, England and the United States from the early 1600's of eastern Canada up to the last mountain rendezvous of 1840 in Wyoming. Although very informative, the writing style is oftentimes difficult to grasp, (especially in the first half of the book), and leaves one somewhat mentally handcuffed. I did enjoy the historical information, but reading the same sentence or paragraph several times to comprehend the subject matter was simply aggravating."
3,Boring beyond belief,"Who is next in the 'Special Forces' book onslaught, could it be their Grandmothers, the local chip shop owner or someone they sat next to on the way to school?The special forces books have proven one thing to me and that is they arent so special after all."
1,Dont get pulled by your nose like me!,"This is a simple trick. By: Frances Nicholson, Andy McNab. As I see it the bit.. will only try to make money on her ex's name. Bad publisher....."
5,Excellent by.,"Excellent sound and clarity. A good choice for monitors for the budget musician. Very nice styling, excellent quality. Unless your ears are destroyed, and you need very high volumes, this is a great buy."
4,Study of Amber,"The Amber Book, by Dahlstrom and Brost makes for good reading by anyone interested in amber. The book is well written, there are many beautiful pictures and drawings. What I found most enjoyable about the book are the little anecdots along the margin of the book which are filled with facts and lore. The authors discuss primarily amber found in the baltic region. I wished the authors had given more coverage to amber found in other parts of the world. All in all a nice book and an easy read."
3,headphone's ok,"this headphone was not what I expected which was a headphone with 2 ear pieces, but should have read the specs more closely. Because of this, it is a bit uncomfortable with one end pressing into your head and there is only one option to wear this. however, otherwise the sound is clear, the audio is clear and you can just connect it with ease."
3,ok headset,quality is a little lacking but functions ok - people on the other end have mentioned that there is a slight metallic sound...
4,"Cheap, but it works well enouph",I bought this headset because it was one of the cheapest that I could find. When it arrived it was simple to plug and play. I use it for playing games online. Quality is not bad at all considering how cheap this item is. For those looking for a cheap solution to communication online this is a great deal.
1,"Microphone not working, no answer from seller","the mic does not work, and the seller did not answer my email.i'm still wondering what to do, bc it would cost me more to send it back than to get a new one."
1,I wouldn't buy again,I bought one of these inexpensive headsets and the audio is horrible. I guess that is what I get for buying a mono headset. Using a standard stereo headset and a built in microphone is a much better route.
4,Great item but sound can be scratchy,"All-in-all, this has been a great purchase. I use the headset both with Skype and for my online classes.My only complaint is that the sound comes out a bit 'funny', like there's a little feedback going on and can also sound a little scratchy, especially if I move my head while listening/talking.Other than that, which is a minor complaint for me (I don't use it all the time), this headset has been an excellent value for the money."
5,Simply the best show on television?,"""Intelligence"" is a show by Chris Haddock, the same guy who brought us the equally obscure Da Vinci's Inquest. It's about the myriad characters in a Canadian Crime Intelligence unit and an organized crime family. The many stories, plots, and calamitous events just keep coming and intertwining into a dizzying mosaic of personal and professional disaster. The show hits the ground at a full run, challenging the viewer to keep up, and maintains that pace until it pours it on even more for the nail-biting season cliffhangers!"
4,Not as cool as it could be,"I was a big fan of the original NES Baseball Stars. This is the primary reason I decided to purchase Baseball Stars for the NGPC. This game is pretty fun, don't get me wrong, but the controls can be a bit frustrating. The biggest problem I have is sending the runners back on a line drive or pop-up, especially with the bases loaded. Also, I was hoping the game would keep stats, a huge factor in why the original was so fun. I would recommend getting this game if you're a baseball fan and willing to put in a little practice, but otherwise go ahead and grab Sonic."
3,The Burrowerseneath,"I was first introduced to Lovecraft when I was 9 years old. The story was the Dunwich Horror. I was hooked. The characters the landscapes and the Ancient Ones came alive and stayed alive. I read all of Lovecraft's stories. I found August Derleth, Clark Ashton Smith. All great writers.I would suggest reading at least Lovecraft before reading Lumley. He refers to all the Elder Gods and Ancient Ones as if everyone knows about them. Crow is the Indiana Jones of the Cthulu mythos. I don't feel the same horror as Lovecraft was able to inspire. Crow's stories are more adventures. Well written,but not Lovecraft by any stretch of the imagination."
2,Dont waste the money,"You can tell just by the writing style that this this collection of work is written before the Necroscope series, in which the author has solified his writing technique and become a horror writter icon. I am and have been a fan of the author since the original release of Necroscope, in which the author matches horror and action quite well. Now the whole Titus Crow series is by far the one of the worst endeavors to be undertaken and is a crime for it to be called Lovecraftian horror. It should be titled Action/Horror. The author does give a pretty good decription of wierd fantasy that is key to Lovecraftian horror, but hints at it thus when you finish with this book you readily want to read the next."
1,"unintentionally funny, otherwise garbage","I wanted to like this book. The cover was nice, I had friends who said very nice things about it, I enjoy the Cthulu mythos. Unfortunately, everything about this book annoyed me. The characters were unconvincing, the monsters read like something from a twelve year olds Dungeons and Dragons game, the dialog was horrible and the stories plodded along at a snails pace. It was a struggle to stay awake through the leaden prose that made up these novellas. I only hope that Lumley was trying to be humorous when we wrote this garbage. Save your money and reread your old Lovecraft"
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in what was on the tape.I expected more dance moves, but I should have known by the length of the tape."
5,Works well as an adaptor,"For some devices, such as PVRs, you need a wireless adaptor that works with an ethernet connection. This is great for that application.I use one with a ReplayTV and am able to stream video to/from my PVR w/ no problems."
1,very bad,"this stereo is really bad because it doesnt have an antena to make the sound good, it always will say it has all the pieces when it is missing a few- or more like 10 pieces thta are either broken or missing. i recomend not buying this stereo! :) :) :) :)"
2,Cooking the Greek Way,"While the 18 recipes in this cookbook (yes, you read correctly, 18) do represent traditional Greek cooking well, most of the recipes would be difficult for a young cook to make without adult supervision and assistance. Traditional favorites such as baklava, spanikopita and stuffed grape leaves are included among the recipes. The beginning of the book has cultural information about Greece and safe cooking tips. This book would be helpful for a school project about Greece, but it is disappointingly short."
2,Machine Error 41,"I had this printer for 13 months. I loved it because it is very flexible, with decent print quality and great features. I particularly liked the network option and the copy quality.However, just go online and search for BROTHER ERROR 41 and you will find the reason why I do not recommend it.After 13 months it stopped working with the dreaded Machine Error 41. I read up on it and called a service center. As soon as I mentioned that I had a Brother printer, the guys said, ""Let me guess, Machine Error 41."" He gets hundreds of these repairs, each time having to replace the print head. In fact Brother extended the 12 month warranty to 24 months (for error 41 only).I seen other people who continue to get this error even after replacing the head. I would avoid this printer and Brother printers in the same class."
4,this local band is indeed the real deal,"as a chicagoan transplanted from michigan, i can tell you that this chicago based band is the real deal. not a usual fan of world music, i was hooked the first time i heard funkadesi at a local suburban summer fest near my alma matter, northwestern u. funkadesi does an incredible job of blending genres into a cohesive sound. they are the antithesis of angst-filled rock and mindless pop, and make live audiences feel positivity as they groove to their ecclectic beats and harmonies. i love countless artists and bands, many angst filled and poppy, but i can certainly make room in my repetoire for this genuinely talented group."
2,Pilate Flop,"The SPRI Pilate Power Ring is a good concept, but I was disappointed in the low level of resistance. The video offers little variety and has poor sound and video quality."
3,"Good Movie, But Sad","Being a fan of Japanese actors, I saw this movie when it was originally released in Japan. It's worth watching, but there are extremely sad parts that I definitely wasn't prepared for from the initial blurb. If you can't handle movies like that, I wouldn't recommend it. Otherwise, it's a great film for the genre."
2,Not upto Scratch,"I am a 'foreigner' who has spent a lot of time in Perth and Western Australia. Initially I had a copy of rough guide Australia, but thought it was not detailed enough on Western Australia (purely because of quantity not quality).This book is simply not upto scratch. My final straw using this book was going to a restaurant in Northam, recommended by this book, which had been shut for several years! If Rough Guide does not cover something, it is because there is no need for it to be covered!My advice would be to purchase Rough Guide Australia. It covers everything in the depth it needs to be covered."
2,Science fiction without the science,"Esau was an O.K. adventure yarn about search for the Yeti in the Himalayas and had enough action to keep you awake. However, I firstly have to say that if all intelligence agents were as stupid as they are depicted in books such as this, America would have been finished a long time ago. Secondly and more importantly, many of us who actually went into the sciences did so because of our fascination with science fiction. Good science fiction starts out with(then goes beyond) real science. This book tossed around outdated as well as patently stupid ideas that no biologist or geologist(or even a grammer school student who watches the Discover Channel)could listen to without shaking his head. Also, the little bit about the swami at the end was about as silly as it comes. It has action, but nothing more...."
2,"Predictable, Formulaic, Disappointing","Went to my local used bookstore looking for ""A Philosophical Investigation"" by Kerr; unable to find it I picked this up as it looked intriguing. Unfortunately I found this novel quite disappointing. I hesitate to complain about predictability, because so many seem to do that, but in this case the shoe fits. There are no surprises to be found here, the action unfolds exactly as you expect it would: e.g, the bad guy turns out to be who you think he will be, his fate is what you expect it to be, the explorers discover what you expect them to find, etc. This wouldn't be horrible if the novel had other things going for it, but the characters are unengaging, the action is unexciting, and there really just isn't much going for this book."
4,Far better than Darton's Neanderthal,"Great writers, like great movies, have my ocasional permission to recur to cheap thrills. Philip Kerr is such a writer. If you're interested in a flowing, imaginative, superbly researched, Indiana Jones like adventure, you've found heaven. Skip John Darton's boring Neanderthal and come where adventure (and the real Yeti) really is. Esau is his name."
3,A little disappointing,Kerr has written some excellent novels (Berlin Noir etc.) but the characters were rather wooden and the plot took a while to get going in this story. Nevertheless the premise was a good one and the last half certainly improved
1,Please...............poor science fiction!,"This book begins as preposterous, entices with some scientific information and a brief romance and then quickly becomes ridiculous science fiction. I did give it 220 pages hoping to jumar out of the crevasse called absurd. The writer has obviously never spent a day climbing. Falling off cliffs in an avalanche thousands of feet and arriving unscathed in a deep cave with a skull. Please! And then the crevasse journey to Shangrila and Lost World......well I'll stop now so as not to upset anyone naive enough to read this book. The Himalayas deserve better. I seldom write reviews but this one obviously ""wasted my precious time"" (thanks Bob Dylan). Don't let it waste yours."
1,Michael Crichton he ain't,"I was interested in the story, but put off by the author's lame writing. This book would have been more exciting had it been about half as long. The mountain climbing scenes were great, but the main characters were stereotypes from Steven Spielberg and not done nearly as well."
1,Bargin bin book,"I picked up this book in the bargin a bin and decided to give it a try. 30 pages in, I was thinking of cutting my losses and tossing it aside. I chose to wade through the technical mombo jumbo of rock climbing and the very thin plot. What I ended up with was a better understanding of climbing. Is that what I wanted to get from this book? No. I will give Mr. Kerr another try but not for awhile."
3,Kerr: Writer or Know-It-All?,"I suppose the sarcasm of the title and the relatively low numerical score given reflect some of the disapointment I feel in the progression of Kerr's work. There were moments in A Philosophical Investigation when it occured to me that Kerr might actually be able to twist the mystery genre to his own ends. There's no sign of this in Esau. The story seems driven more by Kerr's desire to show us he knows more than most about a wide range of things than by its own internal logic and force. In this, he resembles our own loveable bore, Tom Clancy. Still, unlike Clancy, the man can write and the story moves at a decent clip and wraps up with a surprise. Always some things to be grateful for."

2,Quanity over quality,I love callaway golf balls. I am a long hitter and the hx hots explode off of my club face. I saw this deal and thought it was to sweet to pass up. Sadly I should have. The balls were in poor condition and looked like they had seen many rounds. I think my expectations may have been to high. None of the balls are cut or unplayable but all of them are faded and most have scuffs on them. I would say none of the balls are A quality. Few are Bs and C quality. If you like the feeling of teeing up and smashing a shiny new condition ball look elsewhere for a good deal. They are playable and I will most likely use them as shag balls.
1,There are better recycled balls out there,"Just a word of caution....you might be disappointed with these balls. While the photo shows ""A"" quality recycled balls, when I opened the packing I found that all ball were ""C"" or ""D"" quality balls at best. Back they went. I believe in buying recycled balls but not these. There are better quality recycled balls for the same price elsewhere."
1,A terrible book,"After I read other people's review, I bought the book. But after I read the book, I feel disappointed. You can not learn much from the book. If you follow the book, you will lose, especially some pirc lines."
3,Good for complete novices,"First, I must say I was disappointed in how *thin* the book is--big print, not many pages. If you are really a newbie in terms of thinking about evolution and genetics, this book *might* be a useful introduction. For me, I'd read most of the materials he cited and I was hoping for something that would suggest more how selfish gene thinking connects to postmodern theory. This book is not what I was looking for. It works nicely as a sort of ""cheat sheet"" if you want a quick introduction or a quick reminder that doesn't badly oversimplify the ideas. But if you've been thinking about the issues, I'm not sure this book will advance your thinking much."
2,Phone seems not able to handle alot of use,"I am on my fourth Pebl within a year. It seems it either can not take the use or does not liked to be unlocked. I use the phone everyday text/Im/email very often. The picture/voice/video messaging jams when sending so you never know if the other person receives it, and to delete the phone has to be turned off/on. The battery life does not last a full day, thats without talking. The pebl has a good look and the clam shell opening is great. The keyboard is nice, except it always want abort my messages when I type to fast."
4,Called a pebl but made like a rock!,"I've only had this first for about a week, but so far I LOVE IT!!!! I've had many many cell phones, a new one every 4-6 months, and so far this is my fav! I like the rubber like shell of the phone. It was alittle weird at first but play with it for 30mins and you'll love it too!"
4,Bad promotion will keep a good artist unknown.,"For the most part music from the year 2002 with R & B has not impressed me. However, I was pleasantly surprise with Lathun's CD. I brought the CD because a friend sent the BBQ video to my email. If you like Neo Soul you must pick up this CD. I never heard of this artist and it's obvious to me that bad promotion will keep a good artist unknown."
1,awkening the silence,"Well written, fast paced narrative in the style of Sue Grafton, ( A is for Alibi). All the verve and action with insightful views into the psyche of a troubled teen with a supportive family. Touches of Tony Hillerman's Navajo history lessons woven into a quilt of discovery."
4,Inside a protest,"If you want to know what goes on behind the scenes of a protest movement, this novel is for you."
5,excellent service,My product was shipped same day I ordered and recieved it very fast.Will use again very satisfied
5,most amazing perfume ever!,"I am 21 years old. Since I was 15, I have been in love with Irish culture. I found my way into an Irish gift shop in Victoria, BC and smelled this amazing perfume. I fell in love with it in a way that I never before loved a scent. I remembered it and then found in on here. I have been ordering it and reordering it ever since I discovered it. I get numerous compliments on it and simply love the smell myself. It's fresh and clean and mingles nicely with your own body chemistry. It's supposedly unisex but it seems too feminine to me to be so. If you're looking for a new scent and want something unique but not overpowering, this is the one for you. I loooove it."
3,"Careful, it's sharp!","This is a decent quiche pan at a good price that works as it's supposed to. However, the first time I washed it I got a HUGE gash in my hand just from holding it while I washed it. The thing is as sharp as a knife. It's probably not the best pan to buy if you have kids who do the dishes."
5,From Amazon.com. A classic book for lapidary,This book is a classic work - giving tips on cutting and polishing a huge amount of rough - well worth reading and having as an important resource if you want to work with stones.
2,Alert! Only works with Canon professional cameras - description lacking,"I bought this to use with my Canon Rebel XT. The connector in the picture is somewhat obscured by the Adorama watermark and the description simply did not state what cameras it worked with. I finally figured out that it only works with the pro models. Considering this product has been listed for years, I'm puzzled by this lack of information.I contacted Adorama but they did not reply. I simply returned the unit and they deducted the typical amount for what they incurred to ship the product in the first place. So I was out about $6 total and some time for a product that had its description been up to par I would not have purchased.Please correct your description/details, vendor."
2,Not a good book for experienced programmers,"I know that many people love this book, but I'm not one of them. I'm an experienced programmer and this book was not helpful to me. The way the book generalizes about programming concepts, databases and PHP itself makes me think that it is perhaps intended for beginners. Within the zillion pages that this book contains, I'm sure there is useful information. But the book rambles, it doesn't teach. Another book -- ""PHP and MySQL Web Development"" by Welling and Thomson -- takes an approach focused on real-world examples. That book works a lot better for me."
5,It is a wonderful book ever I read.,"this is a great PHP book for beginner since the codes is very clear and its easy to read. besides, there has explanation of the codes so that I know what is going on. However, when I have questions, the author will help me through the E-mail, She helps me alot and I can work better for the PHP. Really thanks for her help."
1,OH how Gurdjieffs teachings have fallen like Sophia into matter,"Im no follower of gurdjieff but i know a little of his work and this to me seems absolutely absurd.and to even use the sufi quote in the beginning is to me insulting.BE warned this book has nothing to do with sufism or any spirituality .The authors do not understand the enneagram ( not that i do as well. but i don't claim to ) so instead this book should be called how to reduce the world into easily understandable pre thought out dead knowledge for fun and profit .im sure they sold a lot of books and made a lot of money off people .Remember those who say they know , know not.if you want to understand the ennegram look up J.G. bennetts book ennegram studies is the best."
2,Re-record is NEVER the same,"These are re-recorded versions and, of course, the excitement and energy is completely gone in these songs. Sometimes it's just best to leave original art alone. These are horrible and not worth the money. Get the originals and feel the energy, the art, the passion and the excitement of what it was really like back in the day and not the loathing of an artist 25/30 years later. Sorry we lost Andrea True (November 2011) but her best was 1976/1977."
3,So Fun!!!,"This games is one the entire family has grown to love. We have had many fun filled days centered around this product. That being said the durability of this set is limited. The center cup on my set and several of our friends sets detaches, it only glued in place. After many uses the center cup WILL detach. The game of washers is a awesome game, but would recommend a better quality set."
5,The Family Game!,"This is a game I learned about through a friend and fell in love with it immediately. This is truly a great family game that everyone can enjoy. It teaches strategy, hand / eye coordination, teamwork, etc... Plus it is fun! Easily transportable, compact, and has brightly colored pieces to find if you miss the boards. The best part, if you lose a washer, just run down to the local harware store and buy one! A must for every picnic or get together."
4,Bulls Eye Washers,"We had seen this game being played while camping. My husband loves to play horseshoes so I purchased this game for him. It is very portable in it's own wooden carrying case, and does not take as much room. We love it for camping entertainment."
4,This mouse is OK,"I didn't experience tracking and long wake up time problem as other user has reviewed. I tried some different types of mouse pad and I think it's doing fine.However I think this mouse is too small, I'm used to use large mouse. When I use it I feel more tired than use large mouse, and I'm not used to the back/forward button position."
4,"tastes great, but too brown","This pan is very functional--makes wonderful mini-madeleines that are almost perfect--spongy, delicate, comes off in one piece easily thanks to the nonstick coating, heats evenly, etc. My only complaint is that the shell-surface is too brown, instead of that nice yellow-golden appearance. This seems to be a problem with nonstick pans in general. Other than this, excellent pan."
3,Not what I expected,This is a low budget video that is not meant for moms that just had a baby. I found many of the exercises too intense to do just weeks after having a baby and found it difficult to do the workout at home in my living room.
4,Lamp shade cracked,I didnt like this. Its a cheap lamp and the lamp shade fell apart shortly after I got it
5,Great contribution to American history!,I believe that this is a very important book for American history because it tackles difficult issues of slavery and suffering of the people of color. The strength of Kim's analysis is that he takes a creative approach to the examination. Narrative analysis and literary criticism are employed in a symbiotic creation of significant text. This idea makes a lot of sense in light of current advanced research on the topic of signifying of scripture.
5,Cute!,Needed a cute little set of leaf cutters for pie crust. A little larger than I wanted but they are great!
3,smaller than I expected,I often forget that I should read every detail before ordering. I really expected these leaves to be bigger from looking at the picture. Next time I will read and think carefully about what it says in the details. I doubt I will ever use this prduct.
2,Rusts...,"These are cute tiny cookie cutters- I planned to use them for tiny shortbread cookies. I hand-washed them, put them on my dish rack to dry, and the next day there was rust creeping out of the folded metal tops. I don't like rust in my cookies...I gave them two stars instead of one because they are unique shapes and feel sturdy. If it wasn't for the rust, these would be great."
1,no new sidney,This book offered no new insight on sid vicious--in fact-it seemed it was hardly about sid. I myself could have written a better book about him.
3,"Been There, Done That...","Robert Dvorak's insights into selling art are not bad, but not new, either. Much of what is in this book repeats ""tried and true"" techniques for artists interested in making contacts, extending visibility and taking advantages of opportunities.However, effective marketing is not the same thing as selling. Marketing involves a thoughful understanding of your core purpose, a sense of values, and a sense of precisely what the intended consumer of your product might reasonably expect to get from your work.In this case, very little is said about this necessary activity. Instead, much is assumed about the artist's self-knowledge as it relates to whoever might buy the work, and this assumption is not the most effective.It's a good book, but there is still a great, gaping need for more in this field - where sales and marketing might still be perceived as ""evil."""
1,Don't expect hot coffee for very long,"I have one of these mugs, and I found it's ability to keep coffee hot is rather limited. Within 2 hours, hot coffee is lukewarm. But it's ok if you like your coffee so it won't burn your lips.When you take the solid lid off, to replace with the sipper lid, the condensation leaks all over you. And it means you have to keep a second lid around the mug.The base will not fit in a car cup holder, so it's usage is limited."
4,"Great Thermos, with one thing to watch out for","This really keeps hot things hot, cold things cold, just like it ought to. I have a 45 minute walk to work every morning, I fill this with hot tea before I set out, and the tea is still hot by the time I finish the mug full, about 30 minutes later, even on mornings when the air tempature is in the low 30s (F). The only thing to watch out for is the sipper lid is very, very easy to mis-thread. It seems to go on fine, but it isn't a tight seal, whereupon it becomes a dandy dribble cup, which drips not on your chin where you would notice it, but farther down. One cold morning I suddenly realized the cup had soaked my right pants leg. Funny to read about, I know, but embaressing at that particular moment."
4,Gotta love that 70's soft rock.,"I have always been a fan of Gino Vannelli, but all but forgot about him till I saw a parody of him on SCTV, recently. The very next day, I logged on and found this particular CD, which had all the songs of his that I loved. Needless to say, I was stoked, and bought it as a b-day present to myself. While I was thrilled that the songs were great and his biggest hits are on here, the tracks get a bit more obscure and boring the closer the disc gets to the end. Don't get me wrong, I love it, but the excitement wears off towards the last half of the cd. Still, if you are a fan of this man you will love this. Even if the songs just chill you out towards the end you will love listening to his voice and the amazing range it has."
1,Very disappointed:(,"For those that may follow my reviews, I almost never give a negative review. It may be due to the fact I really try to research the items before I purchase. This item will be an exception. I don't know where to start. Let's just say the design of the tube is the worst I ever loaded in a calking gun. BOTH tubes I got crumpled under the slightest pressure. I had to MacGyver the content out. So, I really never got to evaluate the contents for the delivery system was so badly flawed. It took me hour to un-jam one of my deluxe caulking guns and the other tube destroyed my everyday gun. Until a better deliver system is presented, I will stay far away from this product. I am so disgusted, I will not even attempt to seek resolution. I will chalk it up to lessen learned."
1,Cheaply-manufactured junk.,"I've bought two of these - and ill never buy anything made by Polder again.The first one was a bit hard to assemble - not all the holes for bolts/screws lined up, so it took a lot of muscle power to bend/warp the whole thing into place.The second one was even worse. Literally, it's physically impossible to align the holes for the last bolt. And, to top it all off ... the bolts are getting stripped. I carefully picked a screwhead for my electric driver that EXACTLY fit the bolts. Nonetheless, driving them in half-stripped them. Trying to get them back out, so I could disassemble the unit and return it for a refun, stripped them completely ... WITHOUT taking them out enough for disassembly.So now I'm stuck with a worthless P.O.S. that cost me nearly half a hundred bucks, just so I can take it to the town dump.Yep: quality Chinese engineering!GRRR."
3,Wait and See,"I have used the USB phone twice and callees noted some loss of quality compared to a regular lined phone. However, they both noted it was a slight loss and the quality entirely acceptable. Time, and use, will tell."
4,from the heart and soul,"that's what i'm talkin about ... take with heart and soul til you can't let it go... feel the music thru your body, mind & let it spiritually fill your inner soul"
4,Hmm Pink Golf Balls,The golf balls were all pink; however the shades vary widely. Some are light light pink others were dark dark pink (almost red). This wide variety of the spectrum was nice.
2,MapQuest on steroids...but nothing more.,"I got this for the sole reason that the software would work with BOTH my laptop and my PocketPC. Boy was I wrong. The functionality of the PocketPC is basically to install Mapquest-like maps and directions on your PPC from S&T; 2k5. No PPC GPS support whatsoever. I have yet to use this with the laptop and my GPS receiver but I'm already disgusted with it. The maps look nice, but with the apparent lacking in GPS support, this package is basically an overpriced trip to MapQuest or maps.yahoo.com.Do not buy this as your primary navigation tool. It would work good to replace the TripTicks from AAA..."
3,Need a Fast PC,"I installed Streets and Trips and the GPS Locator on my old laptop (750Mhz, 192MB RAM, Win 2000) and it ran really really slow. I did not give this product a lower score because I liked the software. It did a nice job mapping routes, but the GPS part left a lot to be desired. I'm going to upgrade my computer soon so I'll update this post when that's done."
2,Software is Garbage,"Software offers no audible turn by turn directions. Software is also garbage! GPS Unit offers weak signal and personally the Bluetooth iPAQ Navigation System has probably been the BEST thing I've ever used... At least w/ that I could be in my basement and still get A GPS signal out! Over all, dont' waste your money... Software is definitely GARBAGE."
5,Streets and Trips,Streets and Trips has been a significant help in making our travel plans. We use it in conjunction with our Garmin 2720 GPS system and they are very complementary. The Garmin system doesn't use downloads from the laptop and Streets and Trips therefore allows us to do trip planning on a braosder scale at home. This is a very good program for trip planning.
2,Headache (as usual) with Microsoft software,"I bought this product, along with Route 66 Europe, just before a trip to Germany and the Netherlands.Route 66 worked GREAT with the GPS receiver, and allowed us to go almost anywhere we wanted to with no difficulty (except for one way streets!). This software was so well thought out that we used it without even reading any of the instructions.When we got back, I tried to use the Microsoft software and am totally stymied because MS's OWN PRODUCT is too stupid to find the GPS receiver on COM 7 (even though Windows Device Manager knows it's there, and Route 66 used it without any trouble). It shows only COM's3 & 4 are available, and doesn't offer any way to connect to the correct port.Isn't it sad that the receiver works so well (MS doesn't manufacture this) but Microsoft's software is, as usual, full of problems?Route 66 needs to make their software available with a GPS device, and then there'd be no reason whatsoever to consider Microsoft."
3,"My husband loves our Black Lab, but is less than thrilled with this cover...","I bought this for my husband to replace his Hybrid cover he lost on the golf course. It's really cute and actually works for some of the smaller hybrid heads, but the larger hybrid heads proved problematic. The head of this cover actually seems overstuffed. When you get it situated on the club, it tends to lean at an awkward angle like it wants to fall off. But, like I said, this was only a problem for the larger hybrids and drivers. Otherwise, the product is decently made and seems fairly durable. Happy Golfing!"
5,Pastry Cloth and Rolling Pin Cover,This is the best pastry cloth I have ever used. Made scones today with no problem of sticking. Constructed so it can be scraped and used without washing every time.
2,Poor battery life and faulty cars,"The McQueen car went first. Motor sounds worked but no voice and rear wheel activation. This, after about two weeks of play.Then the King car stopped working. Same thing, no voice or rear wheel activation. The cars that came with the Shake 'N Go race track are holding up but go through the batterys. The cars have a tough plastic shell and alot of thought has gone into the details. One gets the impression of a quality toy when handeling it and they look good just sitting still. But, that is not what we get them for."
2,I hate these cars!,"1st I mus say I HATE loud toys and expecially loud toys that play for the kids. I prefer old fashoned emagination!My parents bought my boys an assortment of 4 of these stupid cars and my heart sunk when I heard how loud they are. it's obnoxious! They rev and vroom and talk.As to the mechanics they do seem to work fine and look rater durable.If you don't mind loud toys and your kids like Cars than go for it. But if you have a aversion to loud electronic toys... avoid these!NOrmally when a toy is to loud I can tape over the voice box to quite them a bit but these are so loud not even that will help!I can't wait for the bateries to die and they get ""lost"".Besides, my boys enjoyed their playdough and play food so much more!"
3,Showing its age...,While this book charmed many when if first came out. The current generation of suburbanites getting in touch with their place really leaves many older generation books in the dust. The quality of the writing and the purity of information is much more robust in today's writing. Look for something newer to wet your appetite if you wish to learn to think ecologically.
2,Noah's Garden: Restoring the Ecology of Our Own Backyards,"This book is absolutely wonderful, it should be required reading for every lawn fanatic out there. An ecological viewpoint presented in an easy to understand and engrossing style. I would recommend this book to everyone. I am giving copies of this book as presents and loaning my copy to friends. This would be the perfect book to donate to your local or school library."
4,A book worth a look,"I am a greeting card designer and writer. Molly's book sometimes states the obvious in her suggestions for creating greeting cards, but when are looking for the millioneth way of wishing someone a happy birthday, that can be helpful. She walks you through brainstorming and I have to say has enabled me a very fresh thought process for coming up with card copy. It's as though she is happy to share the ""secrets"" of the trade for creating cards. This is one funky business to learn about. It's not like there are college courses on how to succeed in the card business. It's all about observing what's out there and really searching for professinals who are willing to share insights, tips and suggestions and hard facts for succeeding and I think this book does all of that!"
5,best travel mug,"I have purchased several of these travel mugs over the years because they really keep my coffee hot...and for a very long time. Other travel mugs, even the stainless steel ones are not insulated so within a short time period, my coffee is cold and undrinkable. This mug keeps my coffee hot all morning so I can sip it slowly while I work and it stays hot like I like it. I put it in the dishwasher (top rack) and it does OK. After a few years, the bottom rubber cover will come un-glued because of that, but it is still a very usable product. I still have my very first purchase of Nissan Travel tumbler. I was so happy when I found it on Amazon -- and cheaper than I paid for the first one I bought.Thermos Nissan 14-Ounce Stainless-Steel Insulated Travel Tumbler"
2,not worth the price,For the price of this product it should keep the beverage hot longer. But from my experience its only a little more than an hour. I bought my previous tumbler at Menard's for half the price and it keeps coffee hot much longer than this one.
3,Leaks,"Nice design, finish, comfortable and fits in the hand well. But if it falls over, it's going to leak. Returned mine."
3,"good mug, disappointing lid","As mentioned above this mug is very good at keeping your coffee/tea hot and doesn't leak. But I was really disappointed with the lid. It's that kind of shiny softer plastic that I think imparts an off taste your beverage - not the hard, matte plastic lids I really liked on my previous mugs. Also, the edges of the sip hole are pretty jagged, and when you're trying to sip your hot drink very slowly, the liquid gets caught up on surface tension and doesn't get to your mouth. You have to tip the cup up more to break the tension, and wind up with a faceful of scalding liquid. It sucks such an otherwise good design is ruined by a cheap, ill-thought-out lid."
2,No tumbler part about it,"It has great insulation, that's all. It is not even leak resistant. Even a simple movement will bring up hot coffee all over the lid and your hand. If your looking for a tumbler, look somewhere else."
5,One of the Best Books I'v Ever Read!!!,"This book is amazing. It starts off in the past when there used to be magical stuff and dragons. But most of the dragons have been killed by a evil ruler who seized controll long ago. This ruler is crule and very harsh trawds his people. So when Eragon, a teenager living in a remote town, finds a dragon egg, everthing gets stired up. Soon, strange people come to find this mysterious egg. But they dont find it, so they burn down Eragon's house and kill his last relatives. this forces Eragon to go somewhere else. Im not going tell you about the whole book, because, this is a reveiw, not a essay. I give the book 20 stars,and not 5."
5,Great books.,They make the Harry Potter books seem like child's play. These are just two great books and I would recommend anyone who enjoys fantasy to read them. Can't wait for the last one.
3,"Predictable, but enjoyable","Eragon contains the best bits of every other fantasy novel or movie in the list of ""must sees"" and ""must reads."" It's enjoyable because it does what every other good book does. While that does not make it unique or fresh, it does make it a good read. Most people who enjoy fantasy will enjoy this book---but if you've read lots of fantasy, you'll end up thinking, ""Hey, I've read THIS before!!"" or ""Hey, this is just like this scene where...""Not original, but not bad."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I found much of the plot rather predictable with little originality. I will say that the book is much better than the movie, which used maybe 20% of the book, if that, and was an even bigger disappointment. While enjoyable, I would not consider this a great work like Tolkien or Ursula LeGuin or other great authors. Perhaps with more time and experience the author will improve, adding more subtlety and less certainty in the characters.All in all, I'd rate this book as average."
4,Inheritance Probate Court,"While Christopher Paolini's writing is listed as juvenile fantasy, I would tend to disagree. I was first introduced to Mr. Paolini's Inheritance series last year when I picked up a copy of Eragon. I will admit that I picked it up more to see what the mind of a 15 year old could create that would be of interest; I had trouble putting it down. I then loaned my copy to my nephew, and can't get it back. So when Eldest came out I went ahead and purchased the boxed set so I would have both. I am finding Eldest to be the same fascinating read as Eragon. Mr. Paolini has a readable style and an imagination that creates a world complete with interactive characters with life like dramas of their own; he has a future full of possibilities ahead."
1,Are you kidding me?,"I'm outraged over this book especially seeing an appeal to let kids read it if it gets them away from their playstations. Please!! There are thousands of good books getting kids away from their playstations and there's no reason whatsoever to let any kid read this poorly written monstrosity.Grow a backbone, send this junk book back!"
3,eh',"the wording isnt the best, and he uses a lot of choppy sentences, but after the first couple of chapters, you kinda get drawn into it"
4,Shake Hands with George Strait,"This ""Best of"" set from the Millennium Collection is a good introduction to George Strait. His delivery is expressive. His strength is in finding good material. Sentimental songs like ""Love Without End, Amen"" about a father & son that Strait nails tug at the heartstrings, ""Let me tell you a secret about a father's love..."" ""I've Come to Expect It From You"" has an addictive tune filled with romantic disappointment, ""I guess I should thank my unlucky stars that I'm alive & that you're the way you are."" ""Easy Come, Easy Go"" is another Dean Dillon-penned track (""I've Come to Expect It From You"" & ""Famous Last Words"") whose swaying melody fits like a glove. ""If You Ain't Lovin' (You Ain't Livin')"" is Texas swing that sounds like Hank Williams' little brother. The liner notes in the booklet indicate that all of these selections were #1 Country hits. While there is obviously a lot more Strait music out there, but this is a good way to shake hands with George Strait. Enjoy!"
2,ok song,I hear this song all the time&I never really been into Tom Jones at all but I respect How He Macks on Stage with the Ladies.so He gets Player Points for that but musically He has had one to many hits of the cheese for my taste&this song follows that formula.
4,The Trimmer Works Good,"The trimmer works well, holds a charge well, and it follows the contours of your face well. I would give it 5 stars except for the vacuum part. The vacuum chamber is small and clogs up after about half a minute, and then the beard hair goes all over the sink as usual. Has to be cleaned and blown out frequently to work. However, it's still the best trimmer I've ever used."
3,Better than my old trimmer,"I like the trimmer, and would give it 3-1/2 stars. It cuts nicely and is relatively quiet.However, the vacuum works poorly, and is not a worthwhile feature. It captures a little more than half of the trimmings. So you not only have to clean up the bathroom counter, but also empty the vacuum receptacle.Compared to my old Remington, it is an improvement. It has a rotary motor which is much quieter than the Remington's reciprocating motor. It cuts easier and holds its length setting better. However, the Remington's pop-up mustache trimmer was more convenient, because this trimmer requires changing out the cutting head to convert to mustache mode. But since you have to brush out the area under the cutting heads anyway, I guess that's not a big minus."
1,A dog of a shaver/trimmer,"The T970 from NORELCO is the sorriest trimmer i ever ran across.The writeup of this product gets one to think that this is a real great product, but it turns out to be a ""dog"".When I turned it on, after charging the battery, I thought the thing would fall appart in my hands. It does not hold a charge and all around is not what I expected for NORELCO to put on the market.recommed not to purchase this thing."
4,Norelco makes a great product!,"Over all this beard and moustache trimmer are great. The Accu-Vac is a definite improvement over my previous Norelco beard and moustache trimmer. I feel that compared to reviews I read before purchasing the Norelco T970, the Accu-Control settings are a little loose. I enjoy my trimmer and like the added attachements."
3,Norelco Beard Trimmer Good & Bad,I've used a number of beard trimmers over the years. This one is as good as I've experienced. I bought this one for my father who is in his eighties. The various height adjustments are excellent for creative trimming. The only problem with this unit is a battery with apparent memory. The instructions offer all the cautions about how and when to recharge. Failure to abide by the instructions may shorten the battery life or cause it not to recharge...hard to explain to old folks.
1,Defective,"I received mine today, and the on/off button wouldn't work. The only way to get it to work was to squeeze and twist the base. The only problem is that the beard adjustment has to be twisted, too. You can probably guess what happened. What was supposed to be a level 5 shave suddenly and irreparably became a level 2 ""stubble mode"" shave. That just sucks. I used Norelco's live chat to complain and hopefully to get a little sympathy and apology. What I got was a rep telling me that I need to read the manual from now on. Thanks. And thanks for the apology that finally came at the very end of the conversation. I hope you didn't sprain anything.Plus, instead of the vacuum system sucking the hair into the storage chamber, it blew it all over my shirt and the sink. That was sweet, too.Anyway, it's probably just a defective unit, but it still ruined my beard. Actually, I ruined it, but its defectiveness should get most of the credit. The end."
1,John,"Unfortunately, I am unable to review the product. When I received the trimmer it was damaged. Instead of contacting Amazon (my mistake)I called Norelco. It is now four weeks and I still have not been able to resolve the problem. After two weeks and three phone calls I received a pre-paid return label from Norelco. I then shipped back the defective trimmer which they subsequently received. After two more weeks and two more calls I received a replacement. Unfortunately they then sent the wrong item. Instead of the beard trimmer they sent an electric razor. I am, once again, waiting for the appropriate replacement."
2,Unfortunate,"I've been using the Norelco series for about 5 years now. My original still works in fact. I upgraded for new features, etc. That's why I bought this one (for the vacuum.) Well, it does NOT trim as evenly as my previous model (as another viewer noted.) It does make less mess (but still a bit if you've got some growth.) It won't run plugged in. I have to charge it daily (before I can use it.) It's really really really loud and hurts my poor ears. Unlike previous models, the internall AA NiCad battery is no longer accessible, so once it runs out of recharge life I guess they expect us to buy a whole new unit. I'm really sad.........."
2,Not bad while it lasted,Enjoyed it while it worked although I wouldn't call it amazing. After about 18 months it would not get thru 1 trim on a full charge. I took proper care of the battery. My previous Norelco lasted 5 years!
2,not that great of a clipper,This clipper has some design flaws that make it a poor choice for trimming. My main complaint is that is has 7 settings to choose from but the settings are adjustable by a dial ring on the handle and it is easy to set the trimmer on one setting but have it slip to another setting while trimming giving an uneven cut and closer trim than was desired. This trimmer needs to have a setting lock or the dial in a different location than right where you grip it.
4,The best so far (4.4),"...despite knowing all along that the ending will be bittersweet. Eric's lost his memory, and as a result, becomes a delicious guy rather than an amoral one. With Bill out of the picture, Sookie & Eric hook up. Add to that unrelenting intrigue, a dangerous coven of witches, a missing brother, and a variety of shapeshifters, and you have a completely engrossing story. More, it definitely makes the reader wait eagerly and impatiently for the next installment.You'll enjoy this one more if you've read the rest of the series so that you know all the backstory, but I think it can be enjoyed on its own merit."
3,Team Bill,"This was my least favorite Sookie book so far. I really love the first 3 and I'm really into the HBO series. I don't care for Eric, although this pseudo and amnesia Eric was alright, it still was not *really* Eric. Even after the last book I'm still obviously Team Bill, can't you tell? I really really disliked where the author took Jason's character. This is also the first book I read after watching the HBO series, I had read the first three before it aired, and this book just kinda made the series look better. I really want to get caught up on the rest of the books but after this one, eh, I'm not in any rush."
5,"Charlene Harris brings these creatures to life, and in short order.","I have run out of the true blood series at this time, and have ordered the last episode that will be available in May. I have loved every book in this series, and hope they will never end. I would recommend this book to anyone over sixteen."
3,Better than the first three...,"As I have said in my last three reviews on the previous books the only reason I putting myself through the time consuming cloud of these novels is because I love the show on HBO and don't want to wait years to find out what happens (even though the show seems like a different story at times). I was surprised though that this book was actually better then the first three. The story wasn't as choppy and Sookie seems to be acting her age and not like a baby. I am also surprised at how much I like Eric. The producers of the ""True Blood"" series didn't in my opinion choose the right man for the role. Here's hoping that every book in the series improves like this one did!"
4,"Eric, Eric and more Eric............","Charlaine Harris has done it again! A successful installment in the Sookie Stackhouse series, Dead to the World. After a long night at work Sookie finds Eric of all vampires running naked on the side of the road. You know it's going to get even better from there! Witches have moved into Bon Temps territory and this stirs up quite a frenzy in the supernatual community. Of course Sookie is at center of the action whether she wants to be or not. Harris manages to bring back all the familiar characters and the reader gets to see a whole new side of everybody. I really enjoyed that. It's creative and fun and it adds to the development of the main and secondary characters. These books are entertaining and fun, I give kudo's to Harris for making each installment interesting, exciting and sexy!"
2,Pretty poor,"I started reading this series because I am addicted to ""TrueBlood"" on HBO. I have to say after reading the other books at lightening speed and truly enjoying the others, this one is terrible. I do hope the rest of the series picks up. Here is my summation. Sookie= loose woman, crybaby who can't seem to stop making terrible decisions and getting badly beaten up over them. Sookie Stackhouse= Harry Potter all grown up with a libido. One more pet peeve Sookie pointing out the ""word of the day"" randomly throughout this book is totally unbelievable, and not in a good way. Not my favorite, but I am hoping the series will pick up again."
2,An off day for Harris?,"I enjoyed the first three books in this series very much--they were funny and light-hearted, great beach books. This time, however, I gave up halfway through. The Eric of the previous novels was such a delightful scamp, here he is simply a male presence. There are too many minor characters to keep up with, and Sookie seems to have lost some of her sharp wit. I'll just re-read the first 3 books and wait for the fifth to come out."
2,Mediocre,"The modern vampire genre is largely one intended for light and entertaining reading, and fans do not often make the mistake of ""expecting too much"" from such fiction. To this end, Harris delivers - she presents readers with quick easy reads without requiring much engagement or consideration.As the series continues, her skills and confidence as an author continue to improve. However, her established setting is increasingly problematic - though a small town is certainly a charming setting for a novel or two, the height to which Harris has taken the supernatural has likewise increased the absurdity of her books, and becomes a detracting factor."
2,Bring Bill Back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I started watching the show on HBO and like everyone else; I fell in love with it. It made me want to read the books. The first 2 I devoured. The 3rd was okay. I was hoping that the Sookie Bill relationship would resolve. But this book was ridiculously horrible. I hated Eric's character in it. Sookie was off her game. And no Bill!!!! I miss Bill. I am going to read the others, but I am hoping that they get better and that Bill is back in the picture. I know that that show is not following the 1st book exactly and I am happy about that. I hope the show continues on this path because if we loose Bill in the show, I'm gonna stop watching!"
5,books are fun,This was an awesome series so far book 3 continues that tradition I have ordered the next 4 books & hope they are just as good.
3,What's the Catch?,This food coloring kit sounds great except that they do not give the ounce sizes of the bottles. What's up with that? It would be nice to know how much product you are getting for your dollar.
3,duplicate color,"I got these today, and though I cannot comment on their performance, I should note that instead of getting a bottle of black which was supposed to be in the set, I got two bottles of brown. Brown is a color I rarely use so this is quite disappointing."
1,Not a good purchase!,"I purchased this item thinking that it would be the perfect solution for pies that drip over the edge of the pie pan when cooking. This product is very flimsy and arrived completely bent. The seller indicated that it is intended to be bent into different shapes, which makes no sense (and was certainly not part of the product description). There is no way a pie pan can be placed on this oven guard in a way that is level."
5,Necessary if you have the wheel,"This is the add on for the Logitech wheel and includes the pedals(2) and a lap attachment that really helps anchor the wheel. I don't have a table/chair that I can clamp the wheel to so this was nice. Though in the excitement of great games we started using a bungee cord to attach it firmly around our legs. The pedals have a nice realistic feel and respond great in the games. Gamecube games that are a blast to play with the wheel are Need for Speed II, Dakar, and Burnout 2. I've also heard that the Nascar is great. Really makes the games more realistic than ever. A little creativity and someone could build a nice comfortable cockpit with the wheel and these pedals."
4,"Gritty, In-Your-Face style","Mystery-thrillers are not usually my first choice when I browse for a new book, but Richard Jones has crafted a good one in Cocaine Alley. Jones has a flare for the gritty simile (""...my mouth tasted like the contents of Love Canal befor superfund..."") and delivers his story in an in-your-face style. A well researched background, colored by details of Vietnam combat experience (which seemed to come from the writer's own life) and the inner workings of the DEA, give Cocaine Alley the depth and color that kept me turning pages. Cocaine Alley left me hoping Jones decides to write another one soon.I applaud iUniverse, which is a comparatively new company, for getting books like this one into print. My only reservation about this publisher is that their production processes apparently do not presently include copy ediiting or proofreading. I hope as they grow as a company, they resolve this glitch to better showcase excellent stories like this one."
2,Crappy video not worthy of RUSH name,"The band ought to sue the makers of this video for what a crappy job they did on it. And to think that RUSH allowed them to use their band name on the front cover. I have never seen video production this bad. These guys need to go back to school and re-take ""DVD 101"" all over again. It's simply disgraceful. Then, they use stock music (monotonous, bad stock music) throughout all five hours. Uggh! No Rush music. It's cool if you want to see what it takes to get a rock show up and running (although this documentary could have been about ANY band), but that's about it. I wanted desperately to give this only one star, but gave it two only because it has something to do with RUSH! Do yourself a favor: DON'T waste your money on this horribly produced monstrosity. Save the cash and go see RUSH this summer!"
3,Backstage secrets,"As a big Rush fan it is amazing to see what goes on behind the band, and the team work that puts together a great show. I only gave a 3 star rate because the dvd quality was not great.(Been spoilt with blu-ray)all together worth having. A must for any Rush fan. :-)"
3,Do Not Buy this CD!!,"Buy the DVD instead. It's only a couple of bucks more, and it has a lot more songs. I can't believe how many great songs they chopped off the CD. That's my only complaint - otherwise the music is incredible, an absolute must have. I give the concert itself five stars and the cd 1 star."
5,Flawless,"I bought this for college, knowing that I would need a fair amount of caffeine to get me through the all-nighters. The difference is, this thermos will also get me through the day after. As in the entire day. often I will fill it up with tea one morning, and not finish for a full two days, but it's always warm to the last. Absolutely incredible engineering. It is also pretty easy to use: the pouring method is simple, reliable, and effective, as long as you're alright with having to pour into a separate cup (which is important for letting the liquid cool) and it seems quite sturdy (although I did dent the top slightly). Lastly, this thing is gorgeous, a classic modern design and superb materials. I bought this because my dad has had a similar thermos for a very long time and I always admired it, but I didn't think they made stuff like this anymore, it's a simply flawless product."
1,Poorly designed lid leaks,"I purchased one of these new in 12/2007 and the cap leaks no matter how tightly it is screwed on. This cap is designed to allow liquid to be poured when it is partly unscrewed so that one does not have to entirely remove it. However, if one tries to pour this way it just makes a mess and dribbles down the side. More importantly it never forms a proper seal when completely screwed. This unit is a complete waste of money and I suggest buying a different brand/model."
2,It's not the Nissan that I remember.,"I have enjoyed several Nissan products in the past 10 years and was looking for the same quality but with more capacity. I specifically choose this item because I thought that I was getting a Nissan insulated bottle, well I should have looked deeper at the details as it is a Nissan bottle made by Thermos. Right a way I felt the difference and soon found out that it is not the same Nissan that I remember. The biggest difference from my past Nissan items is the material, they're cheep, the stainless steel is thinner and the plastic plug is also a lesser quality. Already after a short drop the bottle has dented. While it does keep my coffee hot for a long time I can't say that I would buy it again."
5,"After I figured it out I think it is a very, very good idea","When I received this thermos, at first I thought there was something wrong with it. For some reason I had the idea that to pour you had to flip up the top. Finally I went to the Amazon.com website and read about it again, it said to twist and pour. So I put some water in it to try it, and voila it poured like a charm. Whoever thought of the idea to leave the cap on (thus retaining most of the heat, which would escape otherwise) had a very, very good idea. The only thing I would change is there would be more specific directions so dummies like me understand better how it works. After I figured it out there is no way this would not be a very good thermos, if not the best! :)"
3,"Thermos does it's job fine, but came damaged","Thermos came with a pretty decent sized dent in the top. I need it for work (bronchitis, tea helps) so I don't want to return it for a cosmetic reason and have to wait, but I'm disappointed because this is already more than I would've preferred to spend. The box it came in was fine and it was packed well so I can only assume it was like this when it was sent out."
1,Not Happy,"I bought this a year ago based on the positive reviews. I have yet to get the bad rubbery taste out of the container. I have tried everything. Sadly, this makes me rather suspect of all positive reviews on Amazon."
5,Does all advertized,"I've had this thermos for about 4 months now. It holds just about 2.5 large cups of coffee and just slightly less than the entire contents of my french press. I use it every weekday and it has saved me it's total expense in coffee purchases within 2 weeks.If you're wondering about if you want this model or another, go with this one. It's a good size, not too heavy, holds enough coffee for a pretty voracious coffee drinker and I've made a pot at 6am and poured it out of this thermos, steaming hot, at 4pm the same day. I can only say good things about it. Well worth the money and a solid product."
5,Better than I thought,This thermos is better that the one I had for several years from LLBean. The Bean one had a push-in type cap that was hard to clean and often got clogged with black yucky stuff which prevented easy pouring. I love the screw top because it is simple in design and easy to use and clean. Keeps coffee hot for several hours and longer if you preheat it with hot water for a few minutes. A great buy and convenient item.
3,Best alternative to plastics.,"Unless you carry your potable water in any plastic other than HDPE 2, 4 or 5 you risk contaminated leakage. This is especially true for the hard plastic-type bottle and the grocery store variety (which should only be used once). Stainless steel is best. Just like grandfather's thermos that he took to lunch every day, the old school way wins out. Unfortunately, the Nissan bottles (I now own two) leak. The stopper is a bit difficult to secure and the ""pour"" and ""closed"" areas don't appear to do much. I'm told Stanley makes a better product."
2,Mac User beware,"Is Norton Antivirus reliable? I think that can be answered with a yes. Well, there are not so many Mac viruses around, so that statement is not validated in my own experience. What neither Amazon nor Symantec really tell you on first glance is that Antivirus 9.0 is NOT compatible with OSX 10.4. So I ended up buying Systemworks (for a steeper price then the Windows products no less) and it did not work. Two lengthy conversations with Symantec's service center in India later I knew that I had to dish otu another $40 for the upgrade to Antivirus 10.0 - you can get reimbuirsed for your purchase but it seems to take a lifetime. The Utilities package was unable to repair one of my disks wken I needed it... who knows why. Otherwise it seems to function OK under 10.4. Overall, my recommendation is if you have OSX 10.4 or plan to upgrade soon, look for another product."
1,It deserves a zero,"I had an older version on my Mac computer that worked with an older version of OSX. When I bought my new iMac it had Tiger installed, and all of the sudden my Norton would not work. I tried to upgrade since what I read on the website said it would work, but I was wrong. The web site was very confusing, maybe I should have called first. Norton needs to come clean and put disclaimers everywhere. Waste of money."
1,Bad Enough to Make Me Angry,"I like the Matter of Britain. I probably will name my first son Arthur. I looked forward to this book. Now I am angry at myself for my habit of finishing books once I start them; this tripe wasted my time. It was written for the sort of stupid people who cannot tell apart Sidney Sheldon and E. M. Forster. The characters are the worst sort of cartoons of human beings, the historical content is aggressively ignorant, and the witlessness of its moral content is exemplified by a character's demonstrating his ""nobility"" by letting a known sociopathic murderer go free."
4,History Repeats Itself,"The Forever King can best be summarized as a historical legend incorporated into a modern day plot. The characters constantly waver back and forth from the present to their lives in different times in the past. The narration changes throughout the novel, going from one character to another, so the reader must stay abreast of the situation to keep well informed of where the plot is headed. This novel's many explainations of historical Camelot and the legend surrounding it can be fully appreciated when put into perspective with these charming modern- day characters."
1,A Legend in His Own Mind,"This writer is the source of the 1964, ""Leo Frank Dental X-Ray Hoax"" and ""Mary Phagan Flesh Bite Mark Hoax""."
1,Not as shown,"The item is not sour patch as the description and picture suggests. After I eagerly awaited for the order to arrive it instead turned out to be Haribo fruit salad, total disappointment. Even better no return Label."
3,Was there a piano in there somewhere?,"I'm still trying to answer the question, ""does anybody in themusic industry have a clue as to how to mike a piano?"" Thisdisk proves the answer is still no. The piano was so in thebackground, it may as well have been behind the second cellos.A number of times, you can see the pianist pressing keys, butnothing is heard. Much of the complex tonal combinations usedin the piano line are simply not heard. Not only that, butthe camera on the pianist's hands had only a fixed view, andthat was blocked much of the time by the wood skirt at the endof the keyboard. The orchestra was great, however, in all threepieces, and the pianist is flamboyant and very talented. Toobad the recording was so bad you couldn't really tell."
2,Not spill proof : Thermos Nissan Travel Tumbler,"After I bought the Thermos Travel Tumbler, I tested it. I observed that it dripped when inverted over a sink, but figured it would never be in that position in real life so I went ahead and used it. Unfortunately, the second time I had it in the car, the tumbler flew out of the car's cup holder when I was parking and a great deal of coffee, not just a few drops, splashed across the passenger seat. (Could this be due to the top-heavy design?) I'm very disappointed with the product and annoyed with myself for not getting the 'spill proof' item I needed."
5,It's everything everyone says it is!,"Without doubt, it is the best designed and workable travel mug I've ever used. I have taken to using mine at home as well. Just bought four more, two for my wife and me, the other two as a gift for someone who was kind enough to return my mug to me after I had left it in his car when on a business trip to another city. That's right, I even take it with me when I fly on business trips and vacations!"
5,nissan ultimate,"I love these mugs. If it is tipped over, only a very little escapes. Stainless constructions makes them sturdy."
2,Leaks,"Keeps beverage hot/cold, but leaks. It worked without leaking for about 2 days, then for some reason started leaking. Disappointed."
1,worse than pirated DVDs,"What a disappointment! I thought I got a pirated DVD. It's even worse.The camera angle was too high, often cutting the toes/feet of the dancers and leaving a huge empty room above the dancers. The swans dancing/standing on both sides were often partially cut off the screen.I had recorded another Kirov version (laser disk or LD, not a live performance, by different principals) before. It was much better. Too bad it's not available on DVD."
3,Disappointed in colors....,"Bought it because the picture showed blue balls. I know it said ""Colors May Vary"", but not a single one was in the bag. Lots of white, quite a few pink of varying shades, couple of yellow, and a few orange balls. I didn't get blue balls. This man came here for blue balls."
2,Chamomile is Not Whole.,"I purchased this brand because it was one of very few Organic whole leaf Chamomile teas Amazon carries that appeared to be good quality. The packaging and bags themselves are wasteful, especially given how few tea bags there are. There is just too much going on with the design of these bags and they dont even stay on your cup well when pouring water. I also wonder about the glue they are using to attach the paperboard holders to the tea bags. The tea bags come flattened out in the tin box, crushing all the chamomile flowers inside. I think I will stick to Traditional Medicinals brand for now, at least the design is more practical and the box can be put in the compost, even though they are not whole. These are for the infrequent tea drinker."
1,NOT appropriate for young viewers!!!!,A couple of the movies are not appropriate for young viewers! One scene had a girl being sexually attacked!!! NOT what I want my family watching!!!
5,Kicked my butt!,"Recommended by a colleague. I didn't even know Photoshop 5 before I went through this book, even after using the Adobe tutorials. Now I understand more about brush control, light and shadows and how to maximize the use of Layers. I feel like I'm armed and ready to tackle my next web design project! I can't wait to see if Jeff Foster does another Photoshop book!"
5,The Dress Code,"Great movie. May be hard for some individuals to get into at first, and it doesn't turn out the way most people would expect. My husband was mad at me until Shirley MacLaine came into the story, and he realized he had misjudged what the movie was actually about. Once he reached that point, he was glad he had stayed around to watch it."
1,It's a piece of junk,"paper jams every min, error 41 everytime, must be unplugged, eats lots of ink, i print about 50 pages and need new expensive ink. It's not worth a penny/ Had it replaced 2 times and serviced twice, but still garbage."
5,This one 'hooked' me on Opera for good!,"This production is a sheer delight. I remember saying ""No wonder opera won't go away after 400 years"" when experiencing this for the first time. Mozart's penchant for making all the characters, no matter what side of the conflict they are on, completely irresistable. You'll want all these delightful folks to get their way. (except, perhaps, the Count!) Very well photographed, in a simple, yet elegant set. Szymtka, while not a natural beauty, aces the two suductive arias. And, her 'letter duet' with the Contessa will melt you into a puddle. I have seen 3 other versions of her role that don't come close. Furlanetto, as Figaro, is exceptionally fun to watch and hear. The rest of the well-balanced cast fills in nicely, to fill the 3 hours with more comedy, poignant moments, drama, and great music than seems possible. Out of about 80 versions of various operas I have seen so far, this is still my favorite."
2,Figaro a Mess,"Mozart's best opera is done almost no justice with this poorly staged, boring mess. The set is sparse and uninteresting and the perfmormers lack the spontenaeity and vim that Mozart/DaPonte's characters require. Furlanetto is terrific as Figaro, and Szymtka is a charming Susanna, but neither the countess (played like an amateur) nor the count (simply boring) hold our attention. The actual blocking looks as if it were done by a first-year directing student. It is often imbalanced and, again, because it rarely enhances the dramatic tension of the (admittedly tense) situation, it is boring. Simply put, this opera needs to be put up by a cast of talented actors (singing isn't enough for -Figaro-) and a director sensitive to the subtlties of Mozart's complex and emotionally nuanced score."
5,So happy to find this!,"Years ago I had soft bound copies on the individual museums. These were collected in this beautiful, hard cover edition. I was so happy to find it."
5,the best advise i could ever get,"Hi,I came across this book thrice and finally decided to buy it... but again God's hand worked fast. My Pastor's wife offered to lend it to me. The book has been a blessing to me in the line of praying for a Spouse. I am in the 'Indian-single-woman-in-late-20's' Group and has been under tremendous pressure. God has been wonderful and faithful leading me to this book and changing my entire perspective. I have learnt to pray for infants so that they can marry a person that God has kept in store for them... and for all my single friends both with and not with the Lord so that they marry a person who is chosen for them by the Lord.... Thanking the Lord for my spouse who is already there for me at the altar! Amen"
3,"Not Too Bad, Not Too Good, Fairly Cheap Microphone","The Cyber Acoustics Lapel Microphone is just OK for casual use. This is a handy mic that can connected to your monitor and used to make quick voice notes in video editing software or Sound Recorder.The sound quality is fairly poor, but certainly usable for most applications that do not require hi-fi reproduction.This is an inexpensive mic and performs as such."
5,Great for the price,"It's still working!Pros:Should have a long life, as it is not thrashed around - being mounted.A 'holster' with a stick pad on the bottom, to mount it where you want. I put it on my desk above the keyboard.Great price!Small size.Long cable.Cons:Being a desktop microphone, it's going to pick up more background noise.Does it come in black?Would I buy it again? Definately, definately!"
5,Great tool,"Used to lay almost 48 10oz tubes worth of Liquid Nails construction adhesive. Worked well, didn't drip. Found it worked best around 50 PSI. I consider it a better value than batter operated units, but then I have an air compressor..."
3,Not Natural Food Coloring.,"I did a search for Natural (non chemical) food coloring. This is the first thing that shows up on the list of items. However, they are NOT natural food coloring. Loads of Red40, which my daughter can't have due to ADHD. More of a fault with Amazon listings than the product or description, but I thought others should be forewarned."
1,This printer sucks!,"I have never been so disappointed with a piece of electronics. This printer will make you pull your hair out. It will mangle your originals, spill ink all over your printouts, and take an eternity to install, all while costing a fortune to keep in ink. The PC faxing software is soewhere in the same genre as the Atari 2600. Do not buy this printer."
5,"While at the eye doctor's last week, I ...","While at the eye doctor's last week, I asked him about trying the Supra Clens daily cleaner. It turns out this is one of the products that he includes in his """"new user"""" kits. This product is so convenient to use -- just put a single drop in each side of the contact case and you're done. I'd recommend it highly because it does a great job of keeping my contacts clean."
2,Check items before advertising them!,"If a person is selling films on Amazon, it should be the responsibility of the seller to properly advertise the merchandise. My Bloody Valentine is being sold in two versions--one is unedited, the other a version where ALL of what a slasher-horror fan wants from a movie has been cut out. The movie was not advertised as the edited version but that is exactly what I received. If I had known this I would not have wasted my money. I just hope other potential buyers realize that this seller is not checking out the for-sale items before putting them on Amazon."
3,"good, but finicky","I have owned these headphones for around 6 months now. The tuning is really finicky and the sound is limited to a very narrow band of tuning. Distance available is household, but can go up to over 300 feet on very good days. I do have problems even sitting next to the transponder. Since the antenna is in the earpiece, turning your head can cause static spots. While thse are decent headphones, they can get your ears hot and the top of the headphones stand up about 2 inches above your head. So, if you don't mind looking like you are wearing a helmet and listening to occasional static along with a constant background humming, then these are ok to get."
1,If you are actually on-the-go this is NOT the mug for you.,"At least in my experience a travel mug with a tea strainer is intended to make it easier than waiting for loose leaf tea to steep at home. This product does not allow for that, the loose leaf tea basket must be removed in order to drink. Once removed you have to carry it around with you some where. What is the point? you might as well steep the tea at home and put it in a mug you already own. Don't buy this product if your intentions were to speed up your daily routine or have less to lug around with you."
3,An almost great idea,"As a travel mug, this is a great item. As a tea infuser, it is incredibly poorly designed. The mesh of the diffuser is too large causing tea leaves to either fall directly into the tea or stick in the mesh making cleanup a nightmare. I had to buy an separate diffuser to simply use the travel mug."
2,Not very mobile.,"For whatever reason, I had thought that the infuser head was drinkable-from. Instead, this product has two heads - the infuser and the drinking one. As a result, that's one more thing I have to carry in my bag and might lose. Definitely pretty unhappy about that.Another small problem: rooibus tea ended up escaping through the infuser into the water.Otherwise, probably a solid device. Too bad I won't be using it outside the house much."
3,not practical,"the only good thing about it was it holds up heat very well. but the fact that there are two separet lids is not conveinent for on the go becase after the tea is brewed, and if you are on the go, you would have to find something to put the tea filter in. Then switch to the sipping cup."
3,good but not great,This mug is good and them I found the JOEmo tea brew from Highwave which is great. This mug holds 11 ounces and JOEmo teabrew holds 14 oz with a nicer open close system that can be turned off and on preserving heat and a much finer mesh for tea. Even works for my very fine Rooibos tea unlike the Nissan's wide mesh filter and the Highwave mug has a better price. Both mugs keep it hot a long time which is nice for my crazy life.
4,Great mug,"Convenient size, works best if you fill with boiling water first (for about 5 minutes-will stay hot for about 2 hours).....otherwise, the beverage will stay warm for about 45 minutes. I really like the fact that you can use it for tea too !"
3,Not as good as I hoped,"I purchased this model because I needed a small size thermos for coffee. This is a well made thermos of good quality stainless steel. My problem is that it doesn't stay hot long enough. I warmed up the thermos beforehand, but my coffee was already lukewarm after 3 hours. It also tasted a bit unpleasant too, like plastic. I never tried the tea part, so I can't comment on it."
3,Nice tumbler but not what I wanted,"I thought this would be a perfect tumbler gift but I noticed it was too small. It looks very sturdy and looks leak-proof. Never tried it though, I had to return it -- unfortunately it wasn't what I wanted. I wish they had it with a bigger size."
1,Terrible,"The one thing that this cup is supposed to do well is be leak proof... After the 3rd time it leaked inside of my bag, it's garbage. It's a interesting concept, but definitely flawed. Don't waste your money like i did."
2,"Not that ""vacuum""","I don't know if this is the case only for what I got from Amazon.com, or all of them are like this, but mine was not a good insulator at all. I previously had a Thermos 16-oz Travel Tumbler which had an excellent vacuum insulation though would leak through the lid. So I chose this Thermos Nissan model according to the ratings and reviews. Although it is really leak-proof, I am disappointed with the insulation. The outer surface gets sensibly warm when containing hot liquid, which means noticeable THERMAL LEAKAGE.Thinking of returning it."
2,Not a 12-ounce thermos.,"Buyer beware, this 12 oz. thermos will only hold 10 oz. MAX. So if you need a thermos that holds 12, go elsewhere."
2,"Great idea, not practical","1. The mesh on the strainer is too small. Pieces of the tea end up getting into the water and eventually your mouth. I'm not a fan of eating tea. I also have a similar item from Teavana and thought this might be an inexpensive alternative. It's worth spending the extra few bucks for a better experience.2. The lid is two separate pieces and has to be stored. From what I've seen, all similar items have this problem. You have half a lid for the tea and the other half for sipping. When you are done steeping, you have to have to put the tea and strainer somewhere. If you go anywhere you have to carry that along.3. Not dishwasher safe.Everything else about it is nice and seems to work well (the seals don't leak and the water stays hot for hours)."
3,Nice design but leak the heat through the lid area,"This is my second one & I received it yesterday. I put boiling water at 8 pm yesterday & check the water 8am this morning. After 12 hours, the water is not hot but warm. I am surprised to find out the quality is not as good as Thermos' other products.( I own 2 other Thermos' cup & bottle)I knew its temperature-keeping would not be good after I put boiling water into to it yesterday because I felt the warmness around the plastic lid area."
5,Perfect gift!,It was just what I was looking for! A great stocking stuffer! Gives people enough time during their busy schedule to make their tea and enjoy it too when they're on the go!
4,"Very nice product - rock solid, highly functional","This thermos is well made and well insulated. I make tea with it daily. The volume of the thermos matches well with a tea I get from Amazon. This tea, Pu-ehr, is a black tea from China, and comes in compressed pellets that look like little bird nests. I put one pellet in the strainer, and fill it with boiling water. The tea that results is quite stiff and yields a sturdy jolt. Here is information about the tea:Rishi Tea Organic Pu-erh Tuo Cha Loose Tea, 5-Ounce Tin (Pack of 2)My only complaint about this thermos is that it tends to cross-thread easily. When cross-threaded, leakage will occur. However, when the lids is correctly installed, it does not leak."
1,"Avoid this, it ought to be burned!","While Domingo certainly knows this opera, he could no possibly know what he was getting involved in.The producers present an unbalanced and distorted view of the themes of Parsifal, especially Redemption through Compassion, by obsessing over Hitler's response to Wagner's works. No one here bothers to mention that the Nazis BANNED Parsifal from all German opera houses, including Bayreuth, in 1939 because they couldn't reconcile its message with their own. But there is an awful lot of blather about purity and blood which I dare you to show me in the opera's text. I've translated every word myself, including the stage directions. Even if you can't read German, there are plenty of good translations available, and a few good books, too, about this opera. Read something, and leave VHS taped garbage like this to the landfills."
4,Let's be fair,"I take exception to the reviewer who said this book was a ripoff. ""The Race to Save the Lord God Bird"" is an excellent children's book, and it's not fair to judge it side-by-side with books written for adults. I thought Mr. Hoose's earlier book ""It's our World, Too!"" is a classic, and ""Hey, Little Ant"" was one of my daughter's favorite books in kindergarten. Ivory-bill enthusiasts will also enjoy ""In Search of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker"" by Jerome Jackson, a dedicated scientist who refused against all odds to declare this species extinct. I recommend it."
1,Who is Johnny Patrick? A shiny and happy ashamed person.,"This collection is fine for happy people, with one great song for everyone.When I think Hammond Organ I think cool, suave, somber, and NOT happy-skippety as all of the songs on this album are except ONE. These musician's even ruined the soulful searching mood of ""Girl from Ipanema"" with bouncy smiley chords.The one exception is a delicious and funkadelic version of ""Amazing Grace"" that is excellent with an attention grabbing intro a most groovy interlude and a final amazing postlude. If the cd cost $7 it would be worth the cost of the cd, but it probably costs more and the other songs ruin it.I ask if Johnny Patrick is an ashamed person, because I bought this thinking he was proud to be associated with his work, but when I search the liner notes and the back of the cd I see his name no where on it. I don't know where Amazon got his name. I was dissapointed by the collection, and I am guessing Johnny was too."
3,Use with caution,"I bought three as I have 3 dogs-one extra large, one large and a puppy. They certainly don't pull as much as they used to. They just seem a bit flimsy so hopefully they hold up."
4,Staying Power ...,"This is a fine addition to anyone's library especially if you happen to be an Eric Carmen fan.The title track ""I Was Born To Love You"" is simply beautiful and presented in typical Eric Carmen fashion(this will be a great wedding song !).The best upbeat song by far is ""Top Down Summer"" ... Beach Boys flavour and all.I must also give kudos for his rendition of ""Walk Away Rene"" which is actually better than the original version."
5,Still mellow & smooth,"This CD contains some of Eddy Arnold's top hits over his vast career. His voice is warm, rich & mellow. He has 2 lady guest vocalists that were nice additions; however, one of them did a duet to ""Cattle Call"" that just wasn't the same as Eddy's original. I did not care for the multi-versed ""Happy Birthday"", but not enough to slight this wonderful CD."
4,These drops were very refreshing and soothing for ...,"These drops were very refreshing and soothing for my dry, itchy eyes. This is a good product for allergy sufferers who need over-the-counter treatments, but don't want to take something that causes drowsiness. It relieves my itchy, red eyes without the use of antihistamines."
4,Good but not very unstable,"I've wanted one of these things for ever after seeing it used in lots of good exercises on the interwebs. I got the Elite because I wanted something large enough to squat on but it's not quite that big and I'm not that big (5'9""). They make an even larger one that I would get in retrospect.As far as instability devices go it is not as unstable as I imagined. Wobble disks are far more unstable. I find it is useful for unilateral stuff, especially with your shoes off.If you have to sit at a desk a lot, like I do, it works well as a pad to kneel on to get you out of a sitting position sometimes. Although you could probably get a gardening pad for much cheaper to do the same thing."
1,Broken Pizza stone,"I have bought 6 of these stones. They are wonderful because of the lip that is built in. Pizza sauce and cheese does not melt all over my stove.BUT, all 6 of them have broken after only 4 or 5 uses. This is really disappointing. Can I get a new one this time??? Or does this company make a better one that does not break so easily???So far I have spent more than $[$$] for the stones. I could buy a lot of pizza with $[$$]. Not sure if I should try again?"
3,Some good advice here,"The author includes detailed charts and drawings, which are indeed helpful. My problem with the book is the rigid categories for body types. My type is almost a Picasso, but deviates from some of the Picasso's key characteristics -- rendering most of the advice for this type useless. I'm somewhat of a Pop Art, too, and the advice for this type contradicted much of that for the Picasso, so I ended up feeling confused. I suggest checking for this book in your local library to determine if it's a worthwhile purchase for you."
4,Hard to find Movie,Both of these movies have been around for a long time. We esp. like Leap of faith. It shows a lot of will power and soul searching thru out the movie!
5,PERFECT,"IT HAS ALL YOU NEED TO BRING A COMPLETE LUNCH TO WORK. It is also durable, and insulated. The quality is superior to anything brand X that you would buy on impulse at a store. Good price."
2,NOT FOR EVERYONE!,"I really enjoyed this book when I read it. I applied all the running mechanic suggestions, and my knees and hips felt immensely better during and after runs.However, the midfoot strike took a toll on my body. I developed a stress fracture in a sesamoid bone (near the ball of my foot) in my left foot. This was in August 2009. I have seen 3 doctors and been on crutches. The latest MRI I got showed that the fracture healed improperly. I am still in pain. I do not run anymore, nor do I even walk properly. I just spent $500 on prescription orthotics. If they do not work, I will have to have the bone surgically removed.I'm sure this book can do a lot of good for people, but it did a LOT of bad for me. I am miserable not being able to run and not being able to bear weight properly.Change your footstrike with caution."
3,"The Big Book of Angels: Angelic Encounters, etc.","This book was a little disappointing. It has wonderful illustrations, but not what I expected in the way of communicating with one's angels. There was too much information on Biblical angels and Bible references to angelic occurrences. Still the book is worth perusing, especially the last half. I would recommend it to anyone new to the ""angel"" world."
1,MIght have loved this when I was ten.,"But as an adult, I can't believe that other adults find this funny or clever or anything but juvenile and ridiculously rude. If it matters, I'm not a religious person, and I've even gotten into (polite) arguments with fundamentalists who wanted to convert me. If you're a fan of Mad Magazine, this might be for you. If you're a grown-up, steer clear."
5,Just what I needed,"I ordered a used copy and received a brand new one!!Human Kinetics has put together another great book. I needed an assessment book to help me understand about muscle dysfunctions as I work towards gaining my massage license.Chapters include: Joint basics, range of motions, physiological limits, postures and gait, neurology, palpation's and clinical syndromes.This book is easy to follow and use, and would recommend it to anyone."
1,Baking Stones are fragile.,"Cooks beautifully - but cracked in less than a month. Yes, I followed all care directions. Buy tile for less money that does the same job."
4,Amy on Conan,"Yes, that was her on Conan, and she performed ""Gin"". That's my favorite song from the album, but there are several great tracks."
1,Where is the Silk??,"Again this states to be a silk reed grass arrangement, it is plastic. The plant is plastic, states created from durable silk. the plant part is not silk, it is plastic. plastic plastic plastic, I dont care what the cost of shipping is, its going back. I will never order another thing from this company."
4,Two stories in one book,Both stories were well written and spicy. The men were well rounded characters you actually liked. I'm not sure which of the two stories I liked better... I do like the idea of a thirty something woman going back in time and ending up in the body of a slender blond eighteen-year-old. Perhaps that is the yummiest fantasy of them all- if only we could all do that! ;)My one complaint though is that the stories were not longer...
1,Only posers & jocks enjoy this garbage...,"I dont see how any one besides straight edge p*ssies can find this crap ""brutal"" because trust me... Its far from that!Hatebreed's ""perseverance"" is pure crap.Anyways,i quess im too old but i rather enjoy my death collection or possessed or morbid angel collectuion more then this garbage. I'll say tho you want brutal ? Listing to disgorge, dyingfetus,devourment, severe torture, internal suffering ,cryptopsy, necrophagist because hatebreed isnt brutal or nearly brutal but insted they sound like posers that have a winp sound."
5,HATEBREED,"they have longer songs, better lyrics. This is really good. It even has Kerry King(Slayer) on it. This is the best from hatebreed in my opinion. The best songs woould have to be: Perseverance, I Will Be Heard, A Call For Blood, Below The Bottom, Final Prayer, and Healing To Suffer Again. Also check out Satisfaction Is The Death Of Desire."
2,Pretty Boring,"I'm sorry but Hatebreed just make me wanna reach for my old Black Flag albums and listen to hardcore that was actually hard and thoughtful. If you like monotone screaming accompanied by repetive, harmonically retarded guitar riffs and forgetable drums and bass, this cd is for you. Some of the lyrics aspire to a greater level than a drunken, spoiled frat boy on a date rape binge, which is good and why this album gets 2 stars instead of one. However I get the feeling that most of the singers experiences come from playing too many video games and watching TV news. I like my metal evil, not just brutal and screw the self-help lyrics, I forgave whatever crimes my parents commited against me a long time ago. Very teenage. No art to it and ultimately dull."
2,Would have been better as an instrumental album,"As I look through the other reviews of this album, I am glad to see that I am not the only person who thinks the lyrics on this album are about as bad as you'll find. I do like the actual music on this album, the guitars and drums sound really good. However, this CD is ruined by singer Jamey Jasta's corny lyrics. Not only are his lyrics forgettable, they drown out the guitars and drums, which, unfortunately for Hatebreed, are the only reasons to even listen to this album. Avoid this album unless you can find an instrumental version, which probably does not exist."
5,Wonderful Work,"This book gives excellent first hand insight on all aspects of being a ranch property owner. The book's authors did an very thorough job in clearly identifing the key elements of aquiring land, raising cattle, and growing pecans. It motivates one to ""Cowboy UP"" and buy some property."
1,Is there something lower than 1 star?,"With all due respect to previous reviewers, I feel compelled to say that this was one of the most ridiculous books I've ever read. Totally unbelievable plot based on little more than astounding coincidences, simpering heroines, and interactions that belie the known patterns of human behavior. I kept reading, thinking surely this will get better, the reviews were good, but honestly, I just don't know how or why people liked this book."
4,Light airy and comfortable,"Very nice crepe silk blouse, light airy and comfortable. The star is deducted because it's a bit tight and runs slightly small in the bust - had they indicated it might run slightly small I'd have given it 5 stars - always remembering it might not be designed for a DD, but that was allowed for when sizing, not too sure of the rather interesting fashion fringe in front, but for the price it will do nicely for later summer evenings."
1,It's not soup yet,"I've been looking for a small thermos and was excited to see that Nissan had a 9.5 oz wide mouth jar. I own one of their thermal coffee mugs and it's keeps my coffee & tea hot for hours. This little thermos does not. The lip burning hot soup placed in it at 8:00am was stone cold by 11:00am. The packaging did recommend it be used for hot & cold items, it mentioned soup. This is not the case. What a big waste of money. I haven't used it since."
2,Where's Mark Mancina?!,"I personally do not like this CD. I am sure if I loved rap, this CD would deffinetly do it for me. But there's loads of swearing and none of the music from the film that I wanted on it. I want Mark Mancina's score. I think they should have at least featured 1 score track one here. This CD is aimed more for the rap fans.Clay G."
2,"good, but narrow at times","this was a good book which interestingly brought up many good issues such as infertility issues, but got very technical and dry with those issues. at the same time, a chapter focused on reproductive rights issues in the workplace and only focused on one of many aspects that could have been interestingly presented. this was used as a book in my women's studies class. i do not strongly reccomend."
1,192 pp of fabricated nonsense best suited for wrapping fish,"There are other books on Phish -- skip this one. Amazon's doing you a HUGE favor including a review that slight's somethign they're trying to sell, but they're right to do so - this book in nonsense. The author clearly doesn't know much about Phish, and many are under the impression that he just made up most of it. Check on the Usenet newsgroup rec.music.phish for daily ridiculing of this 192-page piece of nonsense. Save your nickels. Phish will attract the writing of many books, and this ain't the one you want."
1,Trees actually gave their lives for this trash...,"Total garbage. This book is factually and historically inaccurate, and parts of it make me wonder if the author even KNOWS who Phish is. It isn't even entertaining as a fictional piece. Better off going with ""The Phishing Manual"", which is accurate and contains many Phish tidbits that even hardcore Phish fans may not be aware of. Or check the rec.music.phish newsgroup."
4,"Modern bluegrass gospel with a rustic, old-time edge","A nice, understated bluegrass gospel album, with down-to-earth, unflashy picking, and good group vocals. (Stephenson's voice may take a little getting used to, though -- he's got one of those high, nasal hillbilly voices, like Little Jimmy Dickens or some of the scragglier old-time singers from the Depression era had... But that ain't necesarily such a bad thing, now, is it?) Heartfelt and unpretentious."
2,Murder On The Ears (2 Stars),"I've always liked Anti-Pop Consortium. They may not be my favorites, but I've always showed them love and checked for their material. But I have to ask if these other reviewers have the same album that I have. It's virtually impossible to look past these beats. I'm not feeling this. Whoever programmed these drums and thought these quirky synth patterns were hot ought to be fired.In short: the album is one huge mismatch. The songs with wack beats have tight rhymes and the songs with tight beats have wack rhymes. There are no tight songs. I know I'll get a ton of unhelpful votes, but I call it like I see it (or in this case, how I hear it). And what I heard on this disc was wack.Standout Tracks: None"
3,"The 2nd best ""Antipop"" cd","I would say this is the 2nd best Anti-pop Consortium related CD after ""Arrythmia"". Maybe it's tied with Beans' ""Shock City Maverick"". They have a unique electronic style focusing mainly on trippy yet tight synthesizer sounds, without so many samples. There are some great moments of bizarre yet funky rhythms with clever raps, but there are also plenty of embarrassing awkward moments that should've been left out. These include pointless skits, falsetto singing parts, and one segment in which someone is simply saying ""hello hello"" through a series of pitch changing effects and delays on his voice. I really do like Priest and Sayyid as both producers and rappers. I've been hoping that they would finally put out an album together, but after hearing some excellent material from them this outing is a little disappointing."
3,"Decent, but it comes with a broken wire","The wire is installed and riding in the groove of the board when the unit is boxed and shipped. Movement during shipping can bang the operating handle, which is connected to the installed wire. In my case, that caused the wire, which is restrained in the board's groove, to break (during shipping). I opened the box to find my new board in useless conditions, since the wire was broken and no spares are included. The wire should be shipped loose in the box and installed by the owner after opening. Spares should also be included. Ordering new wires from the manufacturer(I ordered 5)was simple, the wires were cheap and installation is easy. Still, the shipping/packaging people need to resolve the broken wire issue. Aside from that, the unit itself is pretty neat and receives a surprising number of compliments."
5,nice gift,"I bought this for my parents who had one for years, LOVED IT and used it regularly. The cheese cutting wire wasn't functioning properly on the original so I turned it over and found a sticker with Prodyne listed. To my amazement, I found them on Amazon and purchased the cheese cutter/tray for my folks. It was less than $20 (if I recall correctly), makes an excellent hostess gift, birthday gift, gift for someone that like to entertain or someone that is hard to find the right gift for. Great purchase"
2,"Decent shred, poor design","The search for a decent shredder is more dreadful than finding a good fitting shoe! This product was purchased based on my reading others reviews and not wanting to spend $300+ for a small office shredder. The design of the unit is quite poor because the shredder unit sits on the basket in such a way that it is unstable and appears to want to fall over. I would not buy it again, although my home ""11 sheet"" Fellowes shredder bought for less than $50 a couple of years ago is much better..."
3,"Some QC Issues, but good if it works","The first shredder that I received worked well, except for the major issue that the shredder unit did not fit in the bin properly. This meant that the shredder would only run if I pushed down on it to make the safety catch engage. I exchanged it with no hassle through Amazon, and the second one I got works great. It seems to run pretty efficiently, and the safety features are pretty reassuring in a house with two little kids running around. I try to keep the shredder unplugged, but there is always the chance I would forget..."
4,Great Product,"I bought this item about a month ago. It was delivered promptly, it was easy to set up and it seems very sturdy. Another plus is that it doesn't take up too much space!! I like it a lot.[...]"
1,Does not work because improper alignment,"There is a problem with the safety switch located under the top. The machine will not work unless the switch is activated by the lower collector bin. I purchased the shredder and spend 20 minutes trying to get it to work, then notified Amazon and had a replacement sent out only to find the same problem. I found the safety switch and discovered the machine would work when the switch was pressed. However the bottom does not fit correctly to activate the switch. Tape or pressure on the top will get the unit working. Once working I find the motor weak with difficulty with more that 4 sheets of paper. Buyer be warned!!!"
3,good shredder,"Great. Works well. Has main off and on switch on top and another power switch on side which makes me happy for safety. (Have 5 year old in house, he knows not to touch the shredder without me being right there). For small home office realize a smaller one would have been fine, but happy with this one, works great. Also checked consumer reports, I think this was rated best for size. I also realize most mail goes in garbage, less to shred than I thought, but still nice to have."
2,shredder,"delivery-standard shipping,arrived as scheduledproduct-I had to tamper with it to get it to work-so far so good..."
4,works great!,no problems so far. keep it to 5 or less pages that you load in at once and it works perfectly
3,It's OK for Home use,"I bought this for home use over a year ago. The selling point for me was the sensor that stops shredding if touched. That was a plus for me with a toddler in the house and it works well. Sometimes the paper folds and touches the sensor and it stops.The shredder itself is for light to medium use. It is not a confetti shredder and jams if you place 4 or more sheets at the same time. Other than that it works. If you have mission critical documents at home;buy something else. Otherwise, this works well."
4,Looks beefy enough,For some reason I go through shredders like a knif through butter. I never overload them and regularly oil the teeth. This one looks like it may last more than 12 months. Very heavy mechanism and a satisfying smooth loud purr from the shredder teeth. I think it might last!
1,Very Disappointed,"I am very disappointed with this product. Within one month of buying the product it started to occasionally turn on by itself. I ended up unplugging it when it was not in use. Now, less than a year after buying it, it has stopped working completely. It was a waste of money."
4,Work Well......,"I had a lot of papers that I wanted to shred and this machine did a great Job in shredding all of the them. It worked very well. It only got clogged once and I had to try to phisically remove the papers. After that, all I did was try to avoid reaching its limit of 8 papers. Some what noisy but at its price and performance, it was definitely worth the buy."
3,"Decent, Home-Use Shredder","I had a 12-year-old Fellowes shredder, which had given superb service, die recently, so I decided to stick with same brand as a replacement. Am not disappointed with the 57Cs unit, per se, but it is definitely a light-duty, occasional-use shredder. If I had it to do over again, I would definitely spend a little extra for a unit that was a bit heavier duty (look for ability to shred CDs/DVDs, which this unit will not do, as a tip-off).All in all, I got my money's worth, I just wish I had spent a bit more of it for a little bit more shredder."
4,good value for the price,So far this little guy is holding up really well to my barrage! It's really sturdy and I haven't had any problems with overheating. The only thing is they're not kidding about that 8-page limit! I accidentally jammed it when there were some of those doggone statement stuffers in between some bank statement pages and it was REALLY hard to clear it out. I spent about a half hour plucking chunks of paper out of the teeth with tweezers. It's worked fine since then though so if you're a little more careful than me you shouldn't have any problems! :)
4,"Excellent home shredder, quick yet quiet",We bought this model based on reviews here on this site. Our previous shredder finally gave up the ghost. It is much quieter than previous shredders we've owned and munches up the paper very quickly. It may not have the same horsepower of some others we've had but will handle 6 pages at a time and eat up single staples without complaint.
2,NOISE!,Just received this item and it is by far the noisiest machine I've ever owned! Don't know how it will work but will never buy another one!
5,Works as advertised,"Like the ad says, it chomps up several pages of paper with staples at once and can even chomp up credit cards. Since I use this mainly to shred mails that have my ID/bank data on it, I didn't need an industrial monster shredder, so this machine fits my bill. The top is designed for easy removal of shredded confetti and the reversal switch allows for easy ""un-jamming"" of the paper, should you put in too much stuff. I'm satisfied. I also bought the shredder oil so that this may last a loooong time."
3,Decent Home Shredder,"If you want a decent, reliable shredder for home use, this is a good buy for the price. Just don't expect that it will perform as stated-- none of them do.They'll usually shred at an adequate speed, but not as fast as mfg claims-- or shred as many pieces of paper, credit cards, etc without slowing down.Wish the catch bin was larger. I need to empty is too often. Unit would get a 4 star if there was more capacity.Overall, would consider another fellowes home shredder in future if the need arose."
3,Not as Pictured,This is a good product ... but confusing ... in the Photo it looks like it comes with the stand but in reality its just the post and handle ... beware! and if you need the whole pictured system make sure you order the stand as well ...
1,Cloche - not happy with it,"My complaint was, since it has broken and been thrown out, with quality and customer service. I noticed right away that if you set the lid on a flat surface the whole rim wouldn't touch the flat surface. That meant there were gaps when the top was set on the base. I called to talk to their customer service and my concerns fell on deaf ears. I used it anyway since I felt lucky to have gotten mine in one piece because of the packaging.After mine broke I purchased a large terra cotta pot as a lid that fits on a pizza stone. :)"
1,La Cloche Brick Oven,I was disappointed in this product. It didn't help my Sourdough French Bread at all. I wish I could return this product.
3,Received in one piece but no warranty ?,"I was holding my breath because of so many reviews which received the La Cloche in pieces, some two or three times. It arrived extremely well packaged without a scratch. HOWEVER, is there a warranty for this baker ? I did not see one enclosed.Please share your information. Thank you. Anna"
1,I should have listened.,"I thought I would get lucky and not have my La Cloche arrive in pieces. Quite an number of reviewers claimed to have had that problem. But it was not to be. In pieces it was. However, Amazon was very good about crediting my account. Amazon needs to package these things better. It gets bounced around alot in transit and they need more bubble wrap or popcorn in the box that they stick the La Cloche box in. Please be aware that something this fragile needs to be handled with more care.Labeling the outside of the box FRAGILE wouldn't be a bad idea either."
5,nice bread,"received mine in the mail as a birthday gift. packed very well. bakes beautiful bread using the ""5 minute"" recipe that I have also used with great success in Lodge cast iron and on a pizza stone. Liked it so well that I ordered the loaf shape La Cloche. I store them in their boxes on a shelf in my basement with my bread machine and stand mixer since they are too large to keep in my small kitchen. Buy a good long blade, 10-12"",bread knife (under $10 at a pro kitchen supply store) and you are good to go."
2,Sassafras La Cloche Brick Oven,"Received my Sassafras La Cloche Brick Oven yesterday with the idea that I'd be trying it out this weekend. Unfortunately,I discovered that the thin clay handle was broken off the cover. Now I'm in the process of trying to get it returned and replaced.The only reason I'm looking for a replacement and not a refund is due to the good results folks are claiming to get. After looking at the product design, I can see why there are so many that seem to have trouble with handles and cracking.The item is not of a robust design, and seems to be on the delicate and thin side. It does appear that if you can get one delivered unbroken, that it will require some special and gentle care in using and storage thereafter."
3,Nissan Thermos,"This is my fourth Nissan Thermos which is a bit strange in that it is supposed to have a life guarantee. Problem is the cap--plunger does not last as long as the container. It no longer pushes all the coffee grounds to the bottom, thus a new Thermos. Still, it keeps coffee hot, can be carried around and is great for one or two people."
3,Works great. Easy to use. Could be better insulated.,"This is my first non glass French Press. I got tired of cleaning up coffee grounds which is something that I'm convinced if there is a hell they must make you clean up hot, wet coffee grounds every day. My last glass French Press actually exploded with scalding coffee and grounds going everywhere. I will NEVER use a glass press ever again. I like this press. It makes a good amount of coffee, it's easy to clean and use. I haven't put it in the dishwasher, and I don't remember if it said not to or not, but it's easy to hand clean. I like the look with the black plastic handle. I does keep the coffee warmer longer than a glass press, but ""warm"" is definitely the word to use. The temp doesn't drop to unacceptable for me until after around an hour. So it's good for up to an hour's worth of no hassle coffee drinking for me... which works just fine."
4,Coffee Press,Makes good coffee but I still have to run the result through a coffee filter. I believe that is a small price to pay for not having to replace carfes. It doesn't keep coffee hot for long but my Alladin stainless steel thermos does an superd job of that.
1,Poor product,"I am really at a loss as to how others have rated this a 5. Perhaps I just have a faulty model. This is not my first coffee press, I know how to use it. The problem I have is the volume of escape of coffee grounds into the coffee as the plunger is pressed. Sure, we expect a small amount but this is easily much more than that. I've checked and re-checked the unit without success. I am wholly dissatisfied with this relatively expensive carafe...."
4,Great press,"Great little press. This is the only one I've found that combines insulation and a French press. As an added bonus, it isn't glass and therefore doesn't break.With coarse grind coffee, I haven't had much of a problem with ""grounds leak."" Those few bits that do sneak through aren't especially unpleasant... think of them as added fiber...It's as fast as a regular coffee machine and makes much better coffee."
3,"Which is worse, coffee cold or coffee grounds?","I love pressed coffee. And this thing leaks more grounds than any press I've used. But my biggest gripe with coffee presses, until now, is that the coffee goes cold faster than you can drink it.The 3-hour-hot-coffee claim is a stretch. But with wired and shaky hands I can pour that last hot cup, upto an hour or more after the brew.I'm giving this thing 3 stars. I'll take a hot cup of coffee with sludge in the bottom over a perfectly filtered cold cup, any day. Staying warm and wired. JJ"
2,"Sounds great, but actions speak louder than words.","I have been using a French Press for years and when I saw this I thought it would be nice to be able to keep the coffee warm for longer periods of time. It does do that well, but when pushing down the plunger, it almost always forces grounds past the filter screen as well as air which often, even when used very cautiously, comes bubbling out of the spout (Yes, even when it is not totally filled). So if you don't mind cleaning, and you are not apposed to swallowing some grounds, this is the product for you. I occasionally use it to keep coffee warm that I make in my glass French Press, since this does a very nice job of maintaining the heat."
1,these guys suck,Never got the productthey refunded my money a month later after many emails from meIt was supposed to be a christmas present for my husband but it never got here.Will never order from them again
2,Hot? I Think Not!,"I bought this press strictly because I needed the capability of keeping the coffee hot for 2 to 3 hours. Following the directions to the letter, I still cannot get the Thermos to seal completely; and I can pour coffee no matter where the ""tear drop"" is positioned. I'm very disappointed."
3,"Thermos Coffee Press Great, packaging poor","I received the Thermos by Nissan Coffee Press and I am thrilled with the taste of the coffee and the time I can take enjoying each cup without the coffee becoming cold.Unfortunately the screen and spring on the plunger were damaged due to the packaging, even more unfortunate is that to get the press replaced it would take spending more in shipping than the screen and spring plate cost so I will find an outlet for the screen and spring plate and replace it so that I can have a perfect coffee press that I can enjoy the coffee from without having to strain out the grounds."
2,not so much,Reasonbly priced-not well designed. Major flaw is loose fitting cover. If pot is tipped past horizontal cover leaks hot coffee. But it does make good coffee!
3,Too much to clean,To begin with the product broke the second time I used it but it still is a quality carafe so I'll keep it. I guess it is a true press but with no filter you have grounds at the bottom that even if contained in the brewing still must be flushed from the carafe after use. Too much work for me
5,nice french press,"Nice to have a French press that keeps the coffee hot! Not blazing hot, but better than anything else we have tried.We bought it for camping, but are using it every day at home.Made well, pours nicely, we love it!"
2,Not what I expected,"I didn,t realize you made the coffee in the pot. What I was expecting was an insulated coffee keeper that you poured the coffee into after you brewed in a regular coffee pot. Doesn,t stay warm that long, maybe about hours if you are lucky. I tryed making coffee in it a couple times and am not all that impressed. Coffee didn,t taste right, kind of tinny and had grounds in the coffee cup. I am trying to conserve on electric as I have a solar electric system with free gas. Next move is to buy a coleman coffee pot that you make coffee on the stove. I think they should have had in the description that you made the coffee in the pot. To me it is a waste of money and I don,t recomend it. Maybe I might give it as a gift or try to resell it."
4,Good value for a large press,"I have the much more expensive insulated Bodum pressBodum Columbia Thermal 51-Ounce Stainless-Steel Coffee Pressat home and love it, but this works perfectly and keeps the coffee at a good drinking temp for hours. We will see how this one stands up to daily use at work by the whole department, but after a few weeks, it is great."
2,Can't get the smell out,This french press lasted about a year before a foul smell started to cling to the inside. I have tried everything and have never been able to get the smell out. I had to throw it out.
3,Thermos Nissan 1.0 L/34 oz. A bit too big,"This thermos makes really good coffee but it is much larger than I expected. If you want to make a few cups for sitting around the house and have it stay hot, but it. If you want coffee to go, the thing is just too big and bulky to bring with. Also, it's not a mug from which you can drink out of. You have to poor the coffee into a cup or mug and the top doesn't seal so if you stick it in a briefcase it will spill."
4,Finally some real help!,"Between juggling the schedules and workloads of twelve student employees, keeping my two kids on track, and managing a state-of-the-art computer lab, thinking about time management is the last thing I have time to do, but probably one of the most important. Ms. Reno's ""Unofficial Guide"" presented me with some quick and easy tips to cut down on the amount of time I've been spending on unimportant things, and has helped me set aside some of those precious minutes for the little enjoyments of life--like reading more books!"
1,Not at all helpful. Totally useless,"I have a family, work part-time, do charity work, try to squeeze in a few minutes for my wonderful friends.I don't have spare time aplenty. I thought this book would be helpful, but it wasn't.The ideas recommended were common sense, and worse the writing was wordy, dry and not at all engaging.I realize this book is nonfiction, but even nonfiction should offer interesting language, and words, and delightful anecdotes.This book had none of that.In my opinion this tome should have been called THE UNOFFICIAL GUIDE TO WASTING TIME."
2,WAY Over Hyped,I love video games but this is a big WASTE OF MONEY. I usually stick to Nintendo but thought I'd go play it. It's just like Playstation. I'm sure you should wait for the X-Box or especially the Dolphin.
2,I am poor.,"I am really poor. I could only afford the playstation 2 but no games. i dont have enought money to rent the games anymore. i have played battle arena toshinden from the playstation 1 on it and the graphics are worse. the dvd player only has a few options and no surround sound support(even though i cant afford it). do not buy this. the dreamcast is better and has good games like nfl2k1, crazy taxi, sonic and many many more."
1,Playstation-Shmaystation,"All of folks who are so into this PS2 need to wake up. The Nintendo Dolphin is coming, with an IBM Coppermine chip(gold .18 leads inside) that runs at a way faster clock than the Emotion Engine. You think PS2 is the next level? Wait until you play the Dolphin."
2,What I think of the PS2,"I have had the PS2 for about 3 months. I have the games ridge racer & tekken tag. The system has very shoddy graphics and dreamcast blows it away. Maybe in time the games will get better so well have to see. Another thing to note is that dvd-rom is loud as hell, and the reset switch doesn't work all the time!"
3,Worried Words from Japan,"I just returned from visiting the game console capital of the world, Japan, and I want to share my experience seeing the new playstations there. The games are terribly incomplete, released too early. Remember when all there was for the dreamcast was virtua fighter? Yuck. All 14 games released thus far in japan are well below dreamcast quality, most obviously with the graphics. Hope the extra time yields a gem or two for the u.s. release."
5,The Playstation2 is.......,"I remember playing nintendo with my sister, it was hard and fun. I was only five years old at the time. Then sega came out and I wanted to get it for my birthday so I did. Then Sony Playstation1 came out and I didn't wan't to buy it because all my friends wanted the Nintendo 64. So I got N64 because my frinds thought it was so cool. Finally PS2 came out and the graphics were pretty nice. I couldn't belive that it came with a DVD slot. The first time I started playing I was blown away by the graphics. It's not cheap but I would buy it. I give the new Sony Playstation2 5 stars......."
5,Choose Carefully!,":)First, I want to state that the Playstation 2 is fantastic!If you are comparing it to the PSone, it is amazing. It's compatibility is one of it's best features. If you already own PSone games or don't have a DVD player outside of your computer and want one, I highly reccomend it. The X-box has some great games and is bound to have more, however, Microsoft hasn't proven itself very reliable. I believe the Nintendo Game Cube is the best system out there in terms of quality construction.If you can afford all three of the systems get 'em, and the Gameboy Advance too. If you can't afford all that choose carefully... Good Luck!:)"
5,News about X Box & Gameboy Advanced,"Dolphin is now X- Box, and it's games are also 3 and a half inch disks, which run at an incredible speed. The all new, ""Gameboy Advanced"" will be able to be hooked up to X-Box. The old Gameboy Color will be no match for Gabeboy Advanced, generating 36,000 color pixels at once, compared to Gameboy Color, generating a mere 11,500 color pixels. Also, Gameboy Advanced will be in the shape of Sega's Gamegear, and will be able to play both old and new games. Altough all of this info is true, I still believe the upcoming Playstation 2 sales will be much higher than X-Box's or Gameboy Advanced's sales. (I'm a sucker for Sony!)"
2,"OK to take orally, not for topical use","I'm super dry and as I'm sensitive to soy products, I searched for a vitamin E which was not soy-based. Harder than it sounds but, eventually I found this one. I really wanted to use it topically but it's a deep brownish yellow like Betadine and stains everything near it. Took a lot of soaking to get it out of plain cotton. Orally, I didn't see much benefit from it after a few weeks so, I stopped taking it. Too expensive to just keep taking it with no reward. Hope that helps someone else."
2,Don't buy this kit!,"I received this as a gift from a well-meaning person. But I had the same problem as just about every other reviewer here...the stone broke in two after maybe half a dozen uses.I agree with the reviewer who criticized the quality of the pizza cutter. It is very cheaply made, and that soon went into the trash along with the broken stone.I still have the peel and the rack, though. The peel is actually very good quality, and the company does sell that by itself...right here on Amazon. If you want a pizza peel, just buy that, and get a stone from some other manufacturer.I recommend the Lodge Logic cast iron pizza pan as a *stone*...I have had mine for a few years now, and I use it not only as a pizza stone, but for bread baking and other things. It's also sold here on Amazon, do a search and you'll find it.So...buy your pizza supplies separately, rather than waste your money on a kit of which half you'll end up throwing away!"
1,Not Worthy of the Free Gift That Is Was,"Much like MANY of the other reviewers have noted, this product is VERY cheaply made. It is too thin for a pizza stone and as others have written, the pizza cutter is cheaply made as well. My wife and I received ours as a wedding gift and kept it in the box for several years. When I finally opened it, thoroughly read and followed the directions and used it for the FIRST TIME, it cracked down the middle just like other reviewers have noted. Frankly, I'm surprised this company is still in business making garbage like this."
1,"Fair try, but...","Had similar experience with mine...""stone"" broke after about 10 pizzas (even with following the instructions! ), rendering the kit useless! And the cutting wheel is one of the cheapest versions you'll ever see! NOT worth more than $10."
1,Good While it Lasts,"The pizza stone does an excellent job with breads, pizza, rolls, casseroles... Basically anything you want to cook the stone will help cook evenly, and quickly. It's easy to clean, easy to remove from the oven especially with the metal rack/handles that it is set in to. The reason why I gave it one star, even though it does a superb job cooking is because it will crack. I read the reviews when I was buying it, and I doubted that I would have as bad of luck as everyone else. I was wrong. The stone lasted me about 6 months and then just as everyone predicted, it cracked right down the middle.If you're looking for a quality stone that will cook well and you only need to use it a couple times, this is your stone. But if you want something more long term, look elsewhere because sassafras doesn't make it to last."
3,Lester Hortons Advanced Beginners Class,"This is a good DVD. I am always looking for ways to challenge my body, and at the same time learn new dance technique as well. I am intrigued by Hortons Technique because it encourages full range of motion with the body. And it is challenging. The DVD is 90minutes. It is an actual class. There are several dancers that are from the Aileys dance company that are taking the class. I feel the teachers were very thorough with making sure that they were clear in what they wanted the dancers to do and they were very good at demonstrating how they wanted things to be done, by using other dancers that had the correct form of the technique. If you have never done Hortons Technique (like me) I recommend purchasing The Warm Up before this DVD. Because they take more time in explaining the different moves."
2,needs better handle,I had this cheese slicer for six months and it worked fine until the cheap plastic handle that holds the wire cracked and broke. It is now useless.
5,"Amazing book, my 18 months old loves it.","I bought this book reading the customer reviews, and I made the right decision. This is an amazing book with super simple pictures and everyday things of a baby's ife. They can relate with this book easily. This is my daughter's favorite book, she always brings it to me to read for her. The character is realy cute and colors are nice. Every penney worth this book by Leslie is a MUST BUY for every parent."
5,Great Book!,"My 15-month old daughter loves this book! I find myself reading it to her a few times a day; she never grows tired of it. The book holds her attention the entire time while I'm reading it to her. The pictures are colorful and eye-catching. I checked it out from the Library to see if she would like it, I guess now I need to purchase it and add it to our home library. I would defiantly suggest this book to read to infants and toddlers."
4,Top of the Top 25,"Great literature names , Great stories behind names But need more names. This book is really by CArol MCD Wallace. She has another book out The Penguin Classic Baby name book. Be careful that is a reprint of this book don't buy 2."
3,Nothing to write home about.,"Nothing to write home about. Fairly detached with no new information, quite tight-lipped, no elaboration. The most interesting parts were the insights into the Oliver family i.e Jamie."
3,Airex Workout Mat,"Airex is a top brand in mats, but I am a little disappointed at how thin the mat is. My back needs more cushion on a hard floor when exercising. The manufacturer should do a better job of pointing that out--the thinness, that is."
5,The writer LIVES his life,Great book. Funny stories. Not much more to say. I picked it up and never put it down. The poetry is more like little stories or advice. Wonderfully wierd guy I'd like to hang out with.
5,Superb,"I would say this is my favorite album - but then it would be part of a list of 20 of my other ""favorites"". This is truly a classic, and a must have for any collection."
2,Rehashed,"I'm surprised by the comments of people that didn't read the first that things made no sense. I read the 1st book when it was first published and LOVED it then again right before I read this one (and still LOVED it). But then when I was reading this book I feel a lot of the parts were exact repeats of the first! In some places I could almost point to places where cut and paste must have occurred between the two books!While I did enjoy the ending, this book was bogged down with so many repeats of the 1st that I feel I should have read one or the other and been satisfied."
3,Sassafras Superstone Covered Baker,"The Sassafras baker does a very nice job of containing moisture to make a wonderful chewey crust. The problem is, that by the time you get your bread loaf out of the pan, it is mangeled. It sticks so badly that I had to practically cut it out of the pan. I seasoned it with oil and dusted it with corn meal as instructed, but it turned out horribly. I would hate to have seen it without the oil. I was useing sourdough, and I realize that it is naturally a little more sticky. I will try it with regular yeast next time. Hope that does better. If it doesn't, I am very dissapointed."
4,Makes a crunchy crust,"I purchased the Sassafras Covered French Bread Baker after a few months of owning the bell-shaped version aka La Cloche. Both of these unglazed dishes make a significant difference in the texture of the bread's crust. I find the rectangular version to be more practical on a day to day basis, as you can make a large loaf that can be sliced up to make sandwiches. It's also a little easier to store."
1,Not worth the money...,"I am returning this, today!My first of signs this might not work was that it is made in Taiwan. Not the USA like another reveiwer indicates. They may have made Pampered Chef but this is imported.Second, the lid was not a good fit for the base. Since I have never seen one of these, I thought to give it a try.Third, and final break the bank, was that dough came out the edges and created a burned seal beteween the lid and base!I tried two different bread recipes. Both had burned edges and were far too hard on the outer crust. The top was ok, but the sides and bottom were garbage.Yes, I followed the directions provided. Used the appropriate size dough recipe. And still had poor results.I was so hoping this would work. I will try another method for getting a better loaf. Oh, and yes I bake all the time, at least two loaves a week."
5,Worth every dollar!,"Well, I must say that you get every dollars worth and more. The set list goes on and on,(literally) and this 2DVD set is a must have for any guitar fan, not just a Satriani fan.Great closeups of Joe playing, helps you figure out what he's doing etc. Fantastic sound quality for a live performance (one of the best I've heard). Cool extra features, different camera angles on a few tracks lets you be the ""director"".My ONLY disappointment is that there was no ""insert"" or ""booklet"" inside the DVD case, but that is a very Minor issue. The quality of quantity of the music itself, outweighs this 100-1. I say grab this disc set now (and I'm a Van Halen fan!!!)Cheers"
2,Mediocre derivative record,One doesn't need to have a personal vendetta to recognize that this is a weak and derivative record. After reading the last reviews I bought this CD through the Amazon.com used sales to make up my own mind. There is nothing special or particularly interesting about this CD. The vocals are passable if uninspired. If you like Stereolab and St. Etienne I suggest you buy a Stereolab CD.
2,Witchs broom real bristles,Broom fell apart before Hallowen had to put back together.Fell apart again didn't last long would not recommend.Bad construction.
3,It's OK,"I bought this for the headset and case really. the case works well for me and at first i thought the headset wasn't for the phone but if you look on other headset, the inputs look all the same. those little silver things push in you just have to line up the input to the phone silver things down and push. overall it's good for the price."
2,wrong item shipped,"This is the second time I ordered the combo package. The first time the shipment was complete and everthing worked, and you can't beat the price.This second time I ordered the same combo, the wrong AC charger was sent and the plug was too big to fit in my phone, rendering the charger useless to me. It seems like too big of a hassel and costly to ship the item back or to ask them to just replace the one item."
2,"No hands free ear bud,charger is good.",I bought 2 packs recently.One pack came WITHOUT hands free ear bud.I dont know how come it got lost.Charger looks good.This is my first ever complaint on onlineshopping.
1,Over three weeks to ship,I ordered this item over three weeks ago and it still has not even been shipped and the company for the last two weeks will not allow a cancelation. Beware or ordering from this company. I ordered another item from this company on the same day and have not received it yet either. Worst service I've seen in years.
2,Cheap... you get what you pay for.. maybe.,"I was hesitate to buy the ""cheap"" items on eBay so I thought this might be a good deal. Well I finally got the items (after 2 weeks).The case is cheap and doesn't completely cover the big LCD screen. The cutout for the headset doesn't line up with the phone. Of course this is kind of what I expected so I wasn't too bummed about it.The headset is what I wanted. It is almost impossible to get plugged into the phone. Once you do get it, I could hear fine with me. I was told my callers could hear a lot of static though. It does have an answer button on the cord. I just have problems plugging it in and taking it out. I'm really afraid I'm going to break something.I've not tried the car charger yet. Hopefully it will work okay.I guess you get what you pay for so I shouldn't complain too much but maybe I should have risked it with eBay."
5,"Fun, Fun, Fun!","My six year old daughter received this game for Christmas. We have had to tear her away from it for the past three days. She enjoys the different levels and, while she has had some difficulty completing them she enjoys the challenges! She doesn't have any trouble reading the dialogue and genuinely enjoys the game! A great buy at any price!"
1,Beware of counterfeits,"There's clearly something wrong - the ""indicator"" bristles haven't changed after a few weeks, ""indicating"" to me that I've been had. The heads were a little loose on the actual device, too, but I shrugged it off at the time. Google ""Oral-b flexisoft counterfeit"" and check out the results. It would seem that our friends overseas have found a new product to copy. If the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. I'd love to trust everyone, but gone are the days when you could buy stuff from sellers without a little research."
1,Very bad quality,The brushes dont fit wellI couldn't use them and had to go to the store and buy original ones
1,Defective,"I bought a lot of them from this seller.The items didn't work for me, either.The brush is supposed to rotate or revolve.They didn't. They just vibrate a little bit.I still don't know what's wrong with the product.But I feel I have wasted my money."
1,Get the metal one,A little displeased with this. Bread doesn't slide off. I ended up pushing it off and ruining the shape. It was well coated with cornmeal too.
2,"Nice size and shape, but started to split apart after first use.","Like many large wood surfaces, a peel is made from several strips of wood laminated together. However, this peel developed a split after just one use. The instructions indicate maintenance is achieved by wiping with mineral oil, so perhaps you should do this before using the first time. I imagine there are heavier peels available which may be worth checking out.I was rather dissapointed."
2,Loved It - Prior to Warping!,"Loved this pizza peel. However, after using it once, I washed it with soap and water and it warped significantly. It no longer sits flat. I did not submerge it in water and did not put it in the dishwasher, so I was surprised when it happened. For the price, it's not worth the trouble to send back."
1,You get what you pay for - sometimes you get less.....,"A buddy has this - it's cheap asian ""rubber wood.""It's heavy, thick and not very attractive. His is about a year old and warped. I'm not very surprised. We had a Sassafras pizza stone and it cracked after perhaps a dozen uses.I recommend either an aluminum peel which costs less, or if you're willing to splurge, the ""Epicurean"" peel which is what we have."
1,It broke in half after only a few months!,"I bought this. Used it. Liked it. Then, a few months on, for no apparent reason, it snapped in half along the wood grain. Maybe I just got a defective one..."
2,cheese slicer,I am disappointed in this cheese slicer. I had a similar one manufactured by the same company. It lasted for about 15 years! This cheese slicer does not cut all the way through the cheese because the slot in which the wire sits is uneven.
5,Perfect simplicity,"Bought this item for a friend of mine. I own two already. Perfectly simple and atractive design, gets the work done every time. Cleans easy. Excellent value."
2,Not so perfect slice...,"I received the product on time but when i opened it and went to use it, it didn't cut right. the wire was off center and didn't land in the notch that it was supossed to. This always leads to a un-even cut."
5,Cheese cutter,"This one was purchased by request of our daughter for her birthday, but we all ready own one and use it all the time. I have never used a nicer cheese cutter. We love it. It really works and we have owned ours for a couple of years and so far knock on wood have not broken the wire and it has cut a lot of cheese."
4,slicing made easy,Having been promised that a particular cheese cutter would cut hard cheeses it was refreshing to find a product that lived up to the hype.The Prodyne 805B Thick Beech wood Cheese Slicer made cutting my favorite cheeses a breeze.I recommend this product without reservation.
1,Poor reproduction,"I bought this thinking it was a nice little print I could frame and use for decoration. Turns out it's a photo print of the sort you see at Cost Plus or Target in their ""art"" sections for $4-5. Colors aren't very saturated and it lacks contrast and sharpness. I should have realized that you pretty much get what you pay for."
5,topz presta valve cap stems,i use these types of caps for art or craft projects. i thought they would work in what iam trying trying to make.
2,Special size!,It was not clear in the description that these fit only special valves - certainly not motorcycle!!
2,Could've been better,"Wonder why some songs which were there in the movie aren't there on the soundtrack ... Strange that even Switch is not on the OST!! Guess the songs on the OST are sort of ""situational"" which means one would probably enjoy them while watching the movie not while driving ... And Astro Jr, the name of the song in the club when Will Smith meets Eva Mendes for the first time is Five Fathoms (Love More) by Everything But the Girl ..."
3,"Bit ott, don't ya think!","What you said about John Legend's cover of Stevie Wonder's ""don't cha worry bout a thing"", was a bit pathetic and a slight over reaction!! John Legend is a very talented guy and he's done it pretty well, and Will Smith would not of chosen this song to go on the soundtrack if he thought it was THAT bad, which it really isn't! The rest of the soundtrack has a feel good thing going on, just like the film, but not really my cuppa tea!"
2,Not the movie,I was very disappointed that the songs on this album were not a comprehensive list of the songs that I saw in the movie. It's a compilation of mediocre songs. Big disappointment.
2,Uneven,"If you like to read a story where the author is so in love with big, fancy-pants words and spinning his tires without getting anywhere then this is the book for you. This guy has a great command of vocabulary and language and often writes beautiful sentences THAT GO NOWHERE!. To say that these stories are slow in developing would be an insult to slow. The first story is great, I will say that, but the others meander and meander and describe and describe and finally you get a hint of true plot and action without endless description and the story is over. The stories are overlong, overblown and self-congratulatory.Yes he is like China Melville but I actually like China and feel bad saying that. They both have a similar feel to the universe they create and they both have astounding vocabularies but China also incorporates some meat with all the potatoes.This guy had a good idea and then got lost in a thesauras."
5,Ever Heard of Texas Swing?,"The late Don Walser was an incredible musician and showman. I think he is the best yodler. Better than Gene Autry, Roy Rodgers, Marty Robbins, et al. If you are not familiar with Western Swing, try it, you just might like it. He's better'n Kinky Friedman and the Texas Jewboys. Not joking, Kinky's band members were, Little Jewford, Big Nig, Panama Red, Wichita Culpepper, Sky Cap Adams, Rainbow Colours, and Snakebite Jacobs. FOR REAL! Texas Swing is a 'Whole Nother World', it's fun.Steeve-E Crackerboy"
3,Like wow...,"Product is great, nice how it adjust angle of light with less minimum head movement. But after a 4th time use one of LED went out wish it had replacement. For price an quality i rate a 3 star."
3,Kinda Boring,I watched this one 1 time and put it away. It was quite boring. Who ever shoots these doesn't seem to like these types of women very much.
5,Brie is talented,"Brie is a talented singer, and her single ""She Said"" just rocks! She REALLY can sing unlike some other singers out there in the industry. You should REALLY buy her single and her CD in March!"
5,My New Favorite Song!,"Brie Larson's first single off of her album ""Finally Out of PE"" coming out this summer is ""She Said."" The song is amazing <3 Brie is completely original and unlike anyone else. She writes her own lyrics, plays guitar, and has a great voice. Buy this single! You won't regret it!"
3,Catholicism taken too seriously,"Linker's thesis is that the Catholicism represented by Father Richard Neuhaus and his periodical FIRST THINGS is a danger to American liberty. Fortunately this is not the case. This kind of Catholicism, historically called Integrism, has been dangerous in countries with a strong Right Wing Catholic population, where it was the forerunner of Fascism, as in Austria, Croatia, and Vichy France. But in America and among American Catholics it is generally ignored.Still it is good to have these fanatics exposed and kudos to Linker for doing so. I am gratified to report that the Barnes and Noble in my town has taken FIRST THINGS off its shelf -- I guess because there is little interest in it."
5,Any Badfinger is a win-win,"I'll take virtually any Badfinger compilation. This one is pretty good, but as a big fan, there are some of my own personal tastes that would influence my own personal favorites into a ""best of"" collection. When music is this old, which songs are your favorites are often based upon what you were listening to at pivotal points in your personal development. I recommend buying older Badfinger music and deciding for yourself which songs should go into any ""best of"". You'll be presently surprised at some great songs you never heard. Funny - when I named 8 tracks I liked that should've gone into a 15 track best of - another big Badfinger fan crossed off 6 - and replaced them with songs I was lukewarm to.That said - my 2 all-time favorite Badfinger songs are 1) Name of the Game 2) We're for the Dark....and they're both on this CD.RIP - Pete Ham, Tom Evans - you are still remembered and missed."
4,A Great Collection of HIts,"Although I have most of their Albums and CD's its nice to have probably some of their best songs on one disc. A tragic history for such a great band! Most of their albums are represented well from ""Magic Christian"" to ""Wish you were here"".The liner notes are great also. Paul McCartney played on ""Rock of all ages""!The only miss would be ""I'll be the one"". But a great buy for a great bunch of songs."
5,A very informative book,"As an investor, I feel that the information provided in this book was well thought out by the author. He gives a lot of excellent advice for new and experienced investors. I highly recommend all investors read it. Once I started reading, it was hard to put down."
4,"Naked, honest emotions","I applaud DeKok for the naked, honest emotions her characters displayed. She didn't try to soften Jonica's railing at God, nor Stacie's self-centeredness. I found Jonica's faith to be very real and practical. Her journey to healing and Stacie's path to faith were both believable, and not something manipulated by the author. They are women from different backgrounds and belief systems when they meet. And yet, I believed the friendship that grew between them. I came to love Stacie as much as Jonica.Rain Dance is truly a prodigious book. It bears healing within its pages for hurting women, whether they are scarred by post abortion syndrome or infertility, Rain Dance is a must read. But be sure to have a hankie handy. I give it a high recommendation."
2,Patronizing,"I found this book to be both patronizing and oversimplistic. I am not an expert on Islam or any religion, but I know that, especially in these times, one cannot afford to make unfounded assumptions about any faith. And perhaps this was the wrong book to read, but I was expecting (hoping for) an academic treatment of the subject -- that is, an account as unbiased as humanly possible. Of course every author is biased. But I did not expect to be so consistently confronted with this bias. I would hope that any book that purports to help you ""teach"" yourself anything would be honest about the subject and not paint everything up to look perfect. Because a religion can be valid and spiritual and deeply beautiful and still be deeply flawed. God is God, but religion is human. I will look elsewhere for an honest treatment of the subject."
2,PARAMONT / LIONGATE SCREW IT ALL,"I am from China, a fan of P.Ann Miller. I saw the movie RELIC 10 years ago here and it stunned me. So now when I knew the DVD is available I decided to take one. When I received the DVD from AMAZON and put the disc into the player for watching, it really STUNNED me again. Firstly,it is a D10 format,each movie is on one side so you cannot expect the bonus or multi audio track something like that, and the second thing what made me really piss off is for the movie RELIC, there is no MENU at the start( I have watching DVD for more than 7 years this is the first DVD I know without a MENU for choosing chapter, language and substitle.,etc, only get the icon PLAY to press in ) and the picture quality is as bad as the old VHS.What have they done to this movie? No such thing like remaster or improvement? Come on!This DVD was released in 2008!"
5,Best Liquid Bandage,This is the best liquid bandage out there. I have tried every brand I can get my hands on. My skin is very dry and cracks so bad they bleed. This is the only one that takes care of and heals the bleeding cracks. It lasts about 10 days through numerous hand washings and daily showers.After it disappears it takes several weeks before I need to use it again. Really Really good product.
1,Please disclose the limited license up front,Purchased it then immediately returned it once I found the license INSIDE the CD case that indicated that this was a time limited license. Once the license expires the database can no longer be used. It would have been nice to know that up front as I would have ordered hard bound instead of this item.
5,Good to teach children about money!,"This is a great book to read to children to make them more money-wise. It's a bit wordy, so it is not the best with real young children or onces who cannot sit still for long!"
1,Crash Twinsanity,"I received the cartoon but not the game, am very upset as my emails have gone unanswered- will never buy from big gamez again"
2,"WORST CRASH GAME, WORST GAME EVER!","What was once a very good series of games has now become one of the year's biggest disappointments?The game is short, very short in fact 3 hours of gameplay and too many cut-scenes that drag on far too long.Graphics are a bit retro, the game could easily be mistaken for something that could be a Playstation One game or Dreamcast, but an ugly game for any console.The gameplay is very boring and lacks any real design or reward. The levels are bland and un-inspiring.Overall a very poor quality game that should have been much better."
2,utterly disappointing,i miss the classic crash bandicoot games (1-3 and even 4 though it had load screens that would drive you crazy) this one starts a new wave of a crash meets jak and daxter type of gameplay instead of the level at a time play that the classics we know and love had
4,A crazy funny game,This game is the most crazy and funny story line of all the Crash Bandicoot serie.The graphic is beautiful.The sound and music are good.The game play is the same from the other game (for the Playstation version).For a game with vast exploring area is new and fun for a Crash game.
4,Compelling,"Even though you know from the first page that Naomi murdered Peter, you want to get all the details, and you can't stop until you find out. The whole town was so out-of-this-world and mysterious. The book is well-written and keeps you wondering."
3,disappointing,I didn't like the main character. Still left me disappointed in the end. Title of the book was not representable of the story.
2,After Life - No Life,This book is not at all as expected. The main character is pathetic. The book is depressing to say the least. I will continue to try and get through it but so far it is a big disappointment.
4,Shockingly Good Read,"I am most likely to write a review when a book is so bad that I feel the need to warn potential readers from wasting their hard earned money or a trip to the library on it, but this case is very different. This novel tugged me into its web from the very first page. I found myself identifying to a frightening degree with the heroine, wondering what I'd do in the same situation, worrying about her and her loved ones well-being. A fascinating read that makes people simultaneously fascinating, dull and normal, no matter what their outcome in life."
4,Not a ghost story,This book is EXTREMELY well written. The words Rhian Ellis used are beautiful and I had no problem imagining the things that were described. I enjoyed the book very much while I was reading it but now that I am done I feel like nothing happened in the book. If it werent for Ellis's fantastic writing I probably would have given it one star.This is not a ghost story even though it is a story chock full of mediums. It isn't even really a mystery either. I dont know what genre to put this into but it is a good rainy day book!!
1,Doesn't work with Windows Vista,"I bought a new computer with Windows Vista and the the Zio reader that came with the camera didn't work. After talking with on Olympus rep, he suggested buying this product. After working with it for half a day, it became obvious that it doesn't work with Windows Vista. So I sent it back. I had to pay shipping which was expensive. If anyone buys one used and finds an xD card in it, it's mine - I forgot to take it out before I sent the thing back!"
1,BUYER BE VERY AWARE!,"Incredibly, I am told that Olympus camera software is not compatible with Microsoft PCs. So, to read my Olympus media card, I had to purchase a media card reader. No big deal if it works...but it DOES NOT! I installed the software on two different PCs, rebooted both computers and NOTHING! Neither computer can even find the device let alone read it. On top of that, every time I try to find the reader, my computer wants to reinstall the reader software. If you have an older Olympus camera like I do, don't spend your money on this reader; it is a waste."
2,Get the Opus Kura,This issue of the great Furtwangler Fidelio has woefully anemic sound and is outrageously overpriced. Avoid this and get the full-sounding Opus Kura set.
3,Zbus matrix methods superceded by Ybus methods,The methods of Zbus matrix calculation described in this book is now of historical interests only. These methodologies have been replaced by sparse Ybus techniques.
2,2000 Dyno Runs? Am I missing 1200 pages?,"While I think this book has some good information, I think anyone who regularly reads Muscle Mustang and Fast Fords will have read most of this already. It states there are 2000 dyno runs, I counted, and came up with around 180. While this is a lot, most of this was already in MM & FF magazine. They didn't even test a vortech/paxton centrifugal supercharger on a stock engine. They did this test for a Kenne Bell, but it would be a great comparison to test the KB against a centrifugal supercharger. Overall, I am dissapointed, I think most of this is regurgitated material."
3,nice little product.,i like the product . its very handy and good looking. the bad is one of the utensils was broken. the tongs or whatever their called. i guess they just use cheap glue. for the price though i repaired it myself.
2,bamboo splits,"This is a handsome set that feels good in the hand and is nice to use. However, the bamboo holder split open all the way down one side and across the bottom. It's only held together by the black straps. Disappointing."
3,"cute set, but some pieces arrived cracked",I returned these and then bought a nice large set in a chain store for less money with no cracks.
2,Music review,CD is just ok. Not high quality recording. My fault for assuming it was original Andrew Lloyd Weber music. Will be more careful in the future. Quality equal to the low price I paid.
4,Card's 2nd Published Novel,"I first read ""Treason"" a couple of decades ago and loved it. I just finished re-reading it and I still love it. Even though the book is only his 2nd one published, it's amazingly well done. It's interesting that this early work is more ""cerebral"" than his later ones. In the newer books, he drags you into the situation more by your emotions than by your intellect. In this one, his methodology is reversed.The only reason I give this book 4 stars out of 5 instead of 5 stars out of 5 is because there are a couple of situations where the main character behaves just flat-out stupidly. Of course, Card needs those brain-freeze moments to carry out the plot. But, they're disconcerting. A minor quibble in such a work, but definitely noticeable. Still, an excellent book. Highly recommended."
5,Great and easy read for OSC fans.,"I have read almost everything Orson Scott Card has written. In between Ender's Game releases, I decided to read other stand alone novels by Card. This book is a nice and quick read. It will keep you reading up until the end. I do, however, recommend that most readers who have NOT read any Card before, read the Ender's Game series first."
2,Treason by Orson Scott Card: Very strange.,"I didn't even want to finish this book and I'm a big Card fan. I will say it was very imaginative but all in all, just weird."
3,An early attempt by a great speculative fiction writer,Orson Scott Card is one of my favourite writers and this novel had definite potential with a fascinating premise. However about halfway through it started meandering very seriously and by two thirds through I didn't even care how it ended. It felt as though Card forgot the plot. I wouldn't recommend this book to fans of Card's other better works.
5,great product,"This is really a great product!You can cut the pieces to the exact length for your needs, and there is no damage to the plant, as when I've used twist ties or string, to shore up my plants"
1,What a Joke,"As someone who has been involved in the e-learning/training industry for over ten years I cannot believe that I even persisted in reading this junk. It appears that the author is far more interested in creating celebrity for himself than he is in writing a credible and informative book.I would definitely pass on this garbage since there are better books from real experts, not those masquerading as such."
2,"Not suitable for C-5500, despite Olympus's recommendation","This Deluxe Digital Imaging kit is featured on the Olympus website as a recommended accessory to the Olympus C-5500 digital camera. Unfortunately the camera case is much too large to be suitable for the C-5500. (The other included items are fine.)Actually this camera case is too large for just about any point-and-shoot camera on the market. I suppose the idea is they make it big to allow room for you to pack in your accessories, but if the purpose of a camera case is to protect the camera, it doesn't help much to have it rattling around with extra batteries, cables, and card-readers.I recommend you stay away from this kit. Go to a local store and pick out a small camera case that fits your camera."
2,NOT FOR BEGINNERS,"What I was really looking for was a basic German instructional CD to play in my car and hopefully learn German. This does not go over the pronounciation, and it also doesn't follow the instructional manual that it comes with. It moves too quick for someone who is trying to learn Basic German. Not a good buy. It came in perfect condition, the seller listed it well, but the content of the product is not what it promised."
3,Frills and flowers,"Style is definitely middle age, traditional New England. The ""grace notes"" sections have some useful tidbits. Otherwsie book sounds like an old Martha Stewart. Needs more on creating your own style, as well as the basics of how to arrange a room."
3,"Love the product, hate the tip","I've had severe dry eye for 6+years now. I've used preservative-free thera tears this whole time. They started out with a sturdy little vial that had a resealable tip. Now they've extended the tip with a long ""neck"". When I open the vial it is sometimes still sealed shut. Other times it just squirts everywhere. It's such a waste. Many people are complaining but Advance Research isn't doing a thing about it. I guess we need to log more complaints. E-mail address: info@theratears.com"
4,TheraTears,Keeps my eyes moist. Do not like the small opening at the top. Hard to squeeze out the drops with arthritic fingers.
2,Too Preachy!,"I was excited to receive this book last week. I'm engaged and am working on ways to make sure we start off on the right foot. We're both Christian, but I couldn't stomach this! It's definately not written for people that live in the modern world. Its barely a step ahead of advising women to dedicate themselves to the home and be subserviant to their husbands. If you are looking for a 1950's marriage, this is the book for you. If you live in the modern world, keep looking."
5,THIS CD ROCKS!,"These songs are so witty and the melodies so catchy that you will be humming along as well as your children. It really takes rather dry subjects and makes them lively and memorable for young children. Just as Sesame Street updated old ways of teaching basic skills to a young audience, this CD teaches the traditional subjects in new ways that kids can relate to, enjoy and learn from. I hope these two sisters write more CD's so that other grade school kids can enjoy them..."
4,Beautiful,"Jane Siberry is a refreshingly unique, singular and true to herself artist. That makes her worth her weight in gold to me. ""Hush"" is a gorgeous take on spirituals and folk songs. ""The Water is Wide"" is as perfect a recording of a song as I've ever heard anywhere - sumptuous vocals and a deeply moving arrangement. It is as powerful as Mary Chapin Carpenter's ""10,000 Miles"". Put it this way - it's the best ninety-nine cents you'll ever spend. For some reason this current listing is out of order, so if you want to hear ""The Water is Wide"" click on ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot."" I know. Bizarre. But worth tracking down and buying."
3,Are many voices better than one?,"As a longtime fan of Jane Siberry, it's always nice to hear a new album of hers. That said, I do agree somewhat with Amazon's review. I wish she had chosen not to layer nearly every song on the CD with vocals. If any of you remember the song ""Love is Everything"" from her earlier CD, she presented that song in both layered and solo voice form. I preferrred the solo voice and would think that the songs here could benefit from that, too.Still, Jane's voice is beautiful so I will give this three stars."
2,Someone should have stopped her,"I like Jane Siberry and I love some of her music. ""Hush,"" though, is an indulgent mess. There are one or two pieces that I like, but they're not enough to justify purchasing the CD. Because, sadly, at least 50% of the cuts are so unbearable I can hardly sit through them. To be precise, they're INTERMINABLE. I have tried to appreciate them, but all I can do is yell at the CD player, ""End already!""The repetition, the layered vocals, the largely absent music...I appreciate minimalism and modernism but this is ridiculous. There is a point where the producer has to step in and say, ""Whoa."" That didn't happen here."
4,Ms Siberry does it again,"There's no getting around it: Jane Siberry is an artist unto herself. ""Hush"" is the kind of left field release that leaves admirers like me agog at her daring. After challenging ""new age"" music paradigms with ""When I Was A Boy"", then subsequently delivering jazz and then juvenilia albums, she releases an album of reinvigorated spirituals. Granted, her multi-tracked voice and minimal accompaniment lends the songs a certain sameness, but it lends the work cohesion and she's smart enough to arrange and deliver them in sublimely good taste. Although I can't say it's my favourite release of hers, I'm sure it will remain a cherished work I'll return to again and again."
2,Cool Phone- If it always worked,"This is a very cool phone, unfortunately it crashes every couple days and in order to get it going again I have to remove the battery, replace it and restart it. I will be exchanging it for something better. So sad."
1,Do not under any circumstances buy this phone,"I wish I could give no stars for this phone. I have had two Nokia 6682s in my possession since October and both of them had serious, but different, flaws. Since I bought the phone from Cingular, I tried to get the issues resolved there, but Cingular refused to replace the 6682 with a similar device, despite the fact that I pay a premium every month for this very service. Next I tried Nokia, who directed me to send my phone to the wrong service facility. Long story short, Nokia has had my phone for 24 days and does not expect to return it to me for another two weeks. Don't be tempted - it looks cool and it would be cool if cool if it actually worked, but it doesn't. You'll be stuck paying Cingular for a service you can't use!"
1,Does Not Work,"I so much wanted Enviro-Magic to work, but it did not. I tried it in a shower, and nothing, absolutely nothing happened even though I scrubbed with a sponge. Same thing with my refrigerator that had grown black mildew in the folds of the sealer. In this case, I managed to scrub the mildew away with a sponge, but the same thing occurs when I only use soap and water. Also, this product does not prevent mildew from coming back. I hate to use bleach, and I wish there was a safe product out there that got rid of mildew, but this is not it."
2,Good on your boat,"Since a boat sits week after week on the water, it develops mildew. As I didn't want to ruin the fabric or vinyl with bleach, it wasn't until I found this that I was able to get rid of the mildew. It works fine, has a pleasant odor, and doesn't harm fabric. I have also used it on the shower curtains with excellent results. When mildew develops on house interior walls, I reach for this. With further information (see below) I will be very sparing in any usage and try to avoid using it whenever possible."
5,A Review of Nahuatl Literature,"Burkhart's book is a collection of Nahuatl manuscripts with English translations that deal with the Virgin Mary prior to the development of the Guadalupe cult. Burkhart provides an interesting introduction and postscript to place matters in context. The book does not, however, really contain much information on the development of the Guadalupe cult. The reason for this is that there were virtually no Nahuatl materials dealing with Guadalupe until the mid seventeenth century. For the full story on Guadalupe, see Stafford Poole's book ""Our Lady of Guadalupe."""
3,imperfections in clear plastic,"I agree with most of the above reviews. In my opinion, it does scratch too easily, and they should use a more scratch resistant plastic or coating. I have kept it out of harms way in my computer bag, and it still gets tiny scatches in the screen protector. But at $19, I might try to polish them out, or buy a new one when it gets too bad. Also, I was disappointed to find tiny bumps on the inside of the clear plastic. These seem to be manufacturing defects, and one of them is above the screen and degrades the view of the image a bit."
5,"Unknown, but great...","I first ran into Osibisa when I was in high school back in the early 70's. I was thumbing through the used bin at my local record store and the cover of ""Osibisa"" caught my eye because it was a Roger Dean cover and I was into ""Yes"" at the time. Was I in for a surprise!This album turned my head around and I haven't stopped listening to world music (and especially African music) since. The beats are danceable and infectious and the joy in the music here is just great! Osibisa was a great introduction to sounds beyond rock 'n roll and this should be a great intro for anyone who hasn't really listened to African pop. Glad to see it available on CD, I'm buying it right now."
5,Totally Relaxing,"Since Moodswings first album Moodfood, I've been a fan. But, I must say that this album Horizontal is the most unique of all their albums and the most relaxing. This album totally relaxes me and even calms me down during streessful times. Disc 2 is my most favorite since it also incorporates a little more rhythm and beat into the music. Overall, this is by far an excellent album to relax too. A true Aural Medication For Tired Minds. Purchase this album, you won't regret it."
2,Worked well... briefly.,"The screen protector fit nicely, but I was never able to get it completely ""tight"". Around the edges of the protector it did not make solid contact. After a couple weeks it started to gather dust under the edges, which made even more of the protector ""loose"". (I was constantly pressing down on the loose edges to get them to stick, briefly) After 2 MONTHS, the screen protector would not even adhere to the screen any longer.It did what it was supposed to do-- protect the screen. And since it stopped clinging to the screen, I've gotten several scratches. The problem is that for $13 (plus S&H;), I would certainly expect it to last a bit longer!!"
2,Horable story of mans inhumanity to man,"This is a story that needs to be told. Unfortunately in the movie the statistics are slim, photographs are foggy (an having been to Dachau and Auschwitz I know there are better pictures. Anyone with a heart will know what was done was totally inhuman, but the movies hinted and quoted the doctors who felt it ""WAS NECESSARY WORK"". I was also surprised that the movie pointed out that ""we in the USA and some 22 states were the inspiration"" for both the sterilization and even some euthanasia back in the 20's and up to the 40's. This story needs to be done BIG BUDGET and showing the actual but horrible picture of the atrocities. THE MOVIE FELL SHORT showing only a few of the medical ""experiments"" and only talked about a few others understating what was actually done."
4,How can you resist Jimmy Reed?,"I am too young to remember Jimmy Reed when he was famous, but I love this album. He is the most relaxing blues musician I can think of."
4,Wonderful Book!,"Although it is nothing like the Little House series, it is very interesting to continue to follow Laura's life and see the World's Fair through her eyes."
5,Rediscovered treasure,"It is wonderful that the folks at Sourcebooks, who I know most for their reissue of most of Georgette Heyer's works, have turned their attention to the works of D. E. Stevenson.Miss Buncle's Book is one of her earliest books, and one of her funniest. I love the characters and the descriptions of the English Village of the 30's. I first read this book in a Grosset and Dunlap edition from the 30's, which has fallen to pieces, so I am happy to be able to get a new copy, printed on nice acid free paper and ready to last me for many more years of re-reading enjoyment. And now this story of a woman who wrote a book about her neighbors and how she changed not only her life but the lives of the entire village is available to new generations of readers.I hope that Sourcebooks plans to reissue many more books by D. E. Stevenson!!"
2,Junk,"These catches are so lightweight and flimsy, I can't imagine them holding anything shut. Of the 4 I ordered, one was defective; it would bind so that the catch did not spring back into place. The only good thing about these catches is they are cheap. So cheap, in fact, that it's not worth the trouble and expense to send them back."
2,not impressed,"I thought this was overdone and outdone. It's a concept that has been used over and over in other novels, on T.V. and in movies. Frankly, I've heard it before and enjoyed it more with other authors. I read a little over half of the book then got just too bored to continue so I scanned to the end. I don't think I missed much."
5,Very Nice Purifier,"Nice air purifier. I had a fancier one that did ionic and stuff, but that put out small amount of Ozone which bothered me. I got this one instead, simple and elegant. Absolutely no Ozone smell, just clean air. Some people say it is too loud, but I don't think it is loud enough. I would have liked more white noise for sleeping."
5,This product works and is inexpensive...,"I purchased this product 2 years ago. It is still does its job...My ideal of air purifier is something work and is not too expensive, so I decided to purchase this one. Why I give this product a 5 stars because it is very quiet unit and does its job of reducing my sneeze problem in my allergy season. It works so well, so when I am at home I don't sneeze, once I go outside I start to sneeze non-stop. So I know this unit works..."
3,It's ok,"Received quickly and it is ok, it states for very large rooms but is just able to maintain a 120 sq ft room. I dont consider that large."
1,Please Don't Buy,"I purchased this product to eliminate dust in my home, as well as smoke odor. The ratings showed high in both areas. Air Purifier is close to two glass top tables and there has been no change in removal of dust. (Tables are dusted weekly.) For some strange reason larger white particles are on my tables coming from the machine. I truly don't understand how this product has such a high CADR rating when it does not clean the air in any way. If you are an allergy sufferer definitely stay away from this air purifier. My allergies are worst since using the machine...obviously because it is not cleaning the air, nor taking in particles mentioned in their description."
2,DUD!!!!!!,This product did absolutely nothing at all!!!! It runs O.K and thats it...I still have allergies no relief whatsoever and my nose still runs like crazy!!!!! BOOO!!! on you
3,"Large, had best consumer rating for the price","I chose this air cleaner because it was one of the top rated by Consumers Union. I was surprised to see how large it was when it arrived. It is definitely not something you'd put on a desktop. It also uses 3 HEPA filters that cost about $15 each, plus three carbon filters. But the HEPA filters only have to be replaced about once a year. It's quiet on the low setting, noisy on the high. But I sleep well with white noise, so that's actually a plus when I can hear it. Does it work? I assume so, but have no real way of testing the air coming out. We put it in the kitchen once after burning something and it worked very quickly to remove the smoke. One concern is that it puts off an odor when first turned on that quickly seems to disappear. That is a bit disconcerting because you want nothing in the air it puts out but cleaner air than went into it. Overall, it may be better than average except for that particular unanswered question."
3,Nice but could be better...,"I started out using the coverlet brand for my 4yr old who is the size of a 2yr old. They stuck really well but the junior size is not available in any store near us so I went to search online and found these Nexcare pads and decided to try them out. They do fit my daughter (ideal for 2yrs and under) and they do stay on for the most part; however, the coverlets stick MUCH better and I also found a new brand called ORTOPAD that is really cool with cool designs and sticks a little better than the Nexcare but still not as well as the Coverlets but is for sure nicer and in my opinion, a better deal for the price. The ortopad's come in boxes of 50 vrs 20 and have a varity of styles to choose from. Hope this helps someone."
2,works but...,"I tried this and it is okay-ish, but what I really found good is the one from Ortopad. Would be good if Amazon could have that..."
2,Not as great as expected....,"We bought these after a suggestion from a friend who's daughter also had worn an eye patch. We were using the COVERLET brand but they were making the skin around his eye red and irritated. So we bought these at wal-mart to see if they would help and they made it worse and actually tore the skin and made a scab by his eye. Our pediatric opthamologist suggested the ORTOPADS. Plus now we don't have to place stickers on his patches, since they come in fun designs."
2,poor quality reproduction,"The posters are made to order - which makes sense.what doesn't make sense is that they use a sub-standard low res scan of a folded and damaged poster.furthermore the color palette is faded (unintentionally no doubt)so what you get is a nice new poster that looks old and beat up, but in an unconvincing way, as it's new and crisp.anyway, it's now up in the back of my closet where you can't really even see it. not the intention when I ordered it - but it's not $$ enough to bother returning, either.don't even consider a frame for this one - not worth it."
2,Karate Rip-off,"I was not expecting this very old movie that you have to work hard to keep up with. When you want to see Jet Li its from the beginning not him as a child then years later in the movie he's a boy and then finally Jet Li. And where's the collection, there is no collection."
3,...average erotica with some little flaws...,there are some hot girls in this feature and I love Teanna Kai she is stunningly beautiful in the nude as are most of the other girls...it is pretty average erotica with the camera work being the only flaw... I would have loved a little more close ups and longer sessions with some of the girls... all in all its not a bad dvd if beautiful naked women are what you're looking for... there are a few beautiful vulva shots even tho' the camera is a bit too far to appreciate it fully...
2,Soory at best I can only give it a 2 star,"Beautiful women, I'm sure in my teen yeras and early early twenties this cauld have excited me, But all of the ""Peach"" DVDproductions that I've seen are the same and none rate high with me. Just seeing a Gal strip that is just a OK stripper after you've been around the world with many women, these don't excite a seasoned guy much."
5,The True Meaning of Christmas,"The message of SILENT NIGHT is the meaning of Christmas itself: compassion and caring overcoming hatred and hostility. As a history teacher and a human being I highly recommend this movie.The plot is riveting, the characters are real, the setting is wonderful, and the theme will touch your heart to a depth that no sugary-sweet traditional Christmas film can.The producers, director, actors and crew created a movie that you will remember for years after you watch it. It is well worth your time and money."
4,A holiday classic,"Silent Night holds to the high expectations of a Hallmark movie. Well filmed and scripted. I remember enjoying ""Truce in the Forest"" when I was younger; but since that is not yet available on DVD (hope it will be someday) I opted to purchase Silent Night and was not disappointed. The one caveat I have was there is no subtitles/closed captioning, and no other special features to speak of. This film will be a regular watch during the Christmas season, and enjoyable any time of the year."
5,"A Christmas Holiday ""Must See"".","I first learned of this true story over 25 years ago when seeing a brief low-budget 35mm version produced by a religious organization. Though the quality of the movie was very poor, the inspiration of the true event was wonderful!In this more current remake, Linda Hamilton portrays Elizabeth Venkin who host an unlikely household of Christmas Eve guest at the end of war-torn World War II Germany. Every person who I have shared this movie with have the same feeling of warmth and encouragement as they view this movie for the first time.This is a must-see Christmas Season movie! One that if I don't have the opportunity to see it every coming year, my Christmas season will not be complete. The world would be in a different position today if it were filled with morally courageous individuals like Elizabeth Venkin!"
4,Silent Night,Silent Night is a terrific movie for the entire family. LInda Hamilton doe a great job as a mother in WWII Germany attempting to save her only son from a war should does not believe in. This movie shows the human aspects of the soldiers on both sides of the conflict.
5,Just Plain Old Logic,"This is a book definitely worth reading. While the concepts can be second nature to someone who considers themselves a strategic thinker, the way Dr. McGahan defines the different types of competitive environments and they ways to achieve success within them is simple and yet insightful. Any business person should put this on their must read list."
5,Pretty Good Modem,"This is the onle modem I have owned and had for 2 years now. Don't know much about modems or if there are better. I am statisfied with this. I had few problems though, but it was not entirely the Modems fault. I had tried to hook a wireless phone line in my house. While the wireless phone line was hooked my dsl would not work. Since the Wireless phonline was a cheap one, they cost near a hundred or more, it is likely to be the problem. I did not use it. Another problem I had was with my Lynskys wireless router. It needed to be installed and the DSL will not work if it is and I had lost the installation CD of the router so hooking up my new computer, I had to call SBC to help, and they did. They had helped me hook up the Lynksys and I did not have buy another wireless rouer or Order the CD, which Im sure they will charge me."
3,Additional handsets for the BCLD10 handset,"I am happy but very disappointed customer. Yes, I like my handset that fits on the Brother MFC 845CW multi-purpose equipment. It appears to be a very expensive phone for a one unit phone. I have not been able to find additional handsets to place in other parts of my home/office. I do not like having to run back to the equipment to pick up the phone. I would prefer a set where I can have extension phones throughout my home/office.A couple of good attributes includes a high quality easy to use speaker phone which is great when I employ my hands to do other things besides holding the phone. It also seems to have a good range of use as I was able to carry it outside my home and continue the conversation without any real loss of reception."
4,Brother Cordless Phone,"I originally bought the Brother Intellifax 1960C for the office functions of copying, faxing and printing, but when the cordless phone in my kitchen died, I decided to purchase the extensions for the rest of the house. We're happy with the way the system works. The ringer is quite soft, but I confess, I haven't yet looked up in the directions whether or not I can control that."
3,Speakerphone died after about 2 years. Otherwise it's fantastic.,Very durable. Caller id works great. Battery lasted over 3 years! Would definitely buy again. Mine came with the all in one printer
5,Great replacement,"I bought this as a replacement handset for my Brother MFC-845CW machine. Works great, made me realize how much the older handset (7 years old?) had gotten cranky. The old one had a button that was really hard to push and this one is easy, like it should be, and answers when I pick up, without me having to hit any buttons.You can also use this as an extra handset in another room, so I may purchase another. Great phone."
2,I don't like it,"I've been playing DDR for about 2 months now and I've started with this dance mat. Mine isn't wireless, but it's the same model that I got from Toys R' Us. I played this game for about an hour for 3 days until this pad started getting bad and sluggish. The first day it was maximumly great, but it got dull and by now the up button doesn't work very well and I get it down if I'm lucky. Would you rather depend on your luck or go with your skill? So I really don't like this product and feel that it's cheap, and hope that a different dance pad will be better."
2,Boring,"This book was so boring. It seems like the author is focusing more on Conner and Alanna lately than Elizabeth or Jessica. I want to read more about both twins. This book mostly focuses on Alanna and her problems. I think that Alanna is boring and she has low self-esteem, it just makes it hard to read. Conner and Alanna fight then get back together, then fight some more, basically you get the idea. Then there was Andy, his storyline was so predictable in this book, he does stand-up comedy and basically even this storyline was boring. The only part I found interesting was the Melissa/Aaron/Will storyline, and even that part doesn't get interesting until near the end of the book. I also agree with the other reviewer about the models that they use for the cover of these books, the models don't match the character descriptions in these books."
3,Eh,"""You Know Better"" by Tina Ansa is about three generations of women: Lily, Sandra and LaShawndra. The story focuses on LaShawndra and her mischevious behavior as a young teen.For the bulk of the story, LaShawndra ran away from home. She was trying to get to Freak Nik in Atlanta. She was a teen who thought she was grown based on her foul language and promiscuos activity. She does not listen to the counsel that her grandmother gives her. She want to run the streets and be popular. When she runs away, her grandmother tries hard to find her. She finally finds her. Her grandmother seemed to care more about her than her mother. LaShawndra's mother was not really prominent in the story.I don't recommend this book. It was a difficult book to finish because she dragged this story on for way too long. Skip right on over this one. I gave it 3 stars because it wasn't horrible, it just wasn't anything to write home about."
2,YOU KNOW BETTER,This story had a lot of negative energy. There could have been a better way of telling this story. You Know Better was poorly written and boring. It takes you way to the very end to get to the good part which really wasn't. Though I got the message. This is just an opinon. You might like it.
2,Couldn't get into it,"First of all, I need to be honest, and say that I did not finish this book. I read the first two parts about Lily and the other one was about Sandra, and that was it. I could not take it any more. The chapters were way longer than they had to be to get what the author was trying to get over to her audience. It seem to go over and over the same things way to many times before it actually got to the point. I do not recommend reading this book at all."
4,late 2-day shipping,I was very dissapointed that my 2 day shipping (ordered on Wednesday) did not arrive until Monday. Friday would have two-day in my counting. Please advice and refund extra shipping charge.
1,Not your average quality build SOG. Feels like a $20 or less knife.,"So I received this knife about 10 minutes ago and well.. I'm not happy at all. I should have listened to David M. LePage Sr.'s review. He was right on about the quality of the knife. I was hoping that he maybe he received a bad unit. Not so or maybe, I received his return as it does appear this knife is ""used"". I will be posting some pictures before i send it back tomorrow. I also ownSOG Specialty Knives & Tools TFSA-98 Flash II 1/2 Serrated, Black TiNiAnd it's a far superior knife."
5,Best Knife I own,"You wont regret this knife, buy one for yourself. Semper Fi. do or die. Gung ho! Gung Ho! Gung Ho!"
5,Weight falls off,"I got this directly from the old Gilad website...I saw an infomercial about it. Very well done, if you follow the small books (easy to follow) and actually watch the DVDs, you will lose weight. I reccomend it."
4,I liked it.,"""The Best of Wrestling Gold, Vol. 1"" is a pretty cool video. It gives you a chance to see some of the great superstars of yesteryear in their primes. You see things like Hulk Hogan (before he was Hulk Hogan) arm wrestle a young Andre the Giant, Jerry Lawler take on former WCW commisioner Nick Bockwinkel, and a rare piece of footage of a man wrestling a bear. This was back in the days of wrestling being a novelty act or a carnival act, and men wrestling bears was a very common event. This video shows the way wrestling used to be, before it was such a show. It's a great video for people who are into nostalgia, or young fans who want to see some wrestling in it's ""glory days"". Although it should be longer than an hour, ""The Best of Wrestling Gold, Vol. 1"" is overall a great wrestling video."
3,Family Limitation,This book is definitely for people over 21 although it was written in the 1920's. I explains how people in that era used birth control.
2,not Putney's best,"I know I am in the minor opinion on this book, but I didn't like it. The middle of the story really dragged for me and I kept asking myself why I was finishing the book."
4,"At Last, A Mature Heroine!","Having grown tired of heroines being written as weak and mainly dependent on the hero to carry the story, Clare, the heroine in this story was refreshing. Ok, given she is a bit naive, innocent, almost an old maid (in her century) and religious, the 'woman' uses her brains! A fact the Hero was smart enough to appreciate. She is intelligent enough to read Nicholas's intends and respond accordingly... and he does have a hard time getting what he wants. If you are a fan of Billards, there is an intresting variation of the game, if not, you'll certainly want to learn the game.. ( Please note, I'm not giving away the story.. Enjoy!)"
4,Bottled Live,"I would have to say that this CD comes about as close as possible to being at their concert without being there. The first CD in this double-CD offering is pure magic. The second CD has some missteps (for me that is) and mostly those are the songs from AudioLessonover, but it ends really strong. Highlights for me have to be the live versions of 'History Maker' and 'Hang on to You'."
4,I think that Opti-Free Rewetting Drops is a ...,"I think that Opti-Free Rewetting Drops is a good product. I have very sensitive eyes and some drops that I've used sting and irritate, but I didn't have any problems with this product in that area. Although I did find that I had to keep using them in order for my eyes to remain lubricated."
2,good book but differnt age group,i bought this book and i though it would be good for an 11 year old because all of my friend were going to a differnt school so i wanted good advice on that but this has a bunch of crafts and advice for a girl 5 and up but that is just me areally cute book just not for an 11 year old.
2,terrible but enjoyable,"Personally, I agree with the other reviewers about this movie being terrible and actually very frustrating to watch. But if you're like me, and you love horribly made, but entertaining films, this ones for you. I'm sorry to say I had a great time watching this, basically because I love seeing bad films and having a great time laughing at them. But if you want to see a good horror film, or some good acting, please, please, do not watch this. You will be very disapointed. I just have to note I don't know where in the hell Full Moon finds these actors."
1,This really is a poorly realized attempt at an SF novel,"I feel compelled to review this book in a public forum. Katheryn Lasky is an excellent writer, and YAs should read all of her other books. This book, however, is a mess. The author obviously understands and has strong feelings about the moral implications of cloning. She does not understand the science of genetics. The book is rife with misconceptions and the worst kind of pseudoscience. Good science fiction is grounded in science; it is an extrapolation from what we know today. The characters are flimsy and the plot is ludicrous. It falls into the all usual traps that SF novels by non SF readers do. The society of 3038 is exactly like society today. Her characters read the newspaper and watch television in the year 3038! Television and newspapers will change drastically by 2038...they will be unrecognizable by 3038."
3,Not bad for the price,This is a decent lapel mic for the price but it has a few down sides. It works fine for micing one person speaking but other than that it gets muddy.Pros: It's cheap. It's light. The clip is sturdy and strong. Decent signal strength if not obscured.Cons: It's a condenser mic so it picks up the strongest sound in the room. Don't try to record more than one sound source or you'll lose them both. Proximity effect is pronounced (too close and it gets muddy with too much bass)
3,OMNIdirectional Mic is OK,"It should be noted that this mic is OMNIdirectional, meaning it's intended to pick up everything. The quality of the mic is very good, sound is very great, BUT it will pick up background noise. Don't get me wrong, it's A LOT better than the mic that comes on your DSLR or your Camcorder.This mic would be best used for interviews where your subject is stationary and in a quite room. If you intend to move around you will have SOME sounds of movement, not too bad, however, if you're outside, you'll pick up some wind (again, not horrible, but not perfect).Overall, it's a GREAT value for the price, but it's definitely not the final purchase in the direction of professional audio. It's nice for an amateur, and maybe a back up mic as you become semi-professional.zk"
5,Pair it with a Tascam and You're Gold,"I’m pretty amazed at how effective this is with a Tascam DR-05. I bought this lav because a reviewer said it worked really well with the Tascam. He was spot on. As a matter of fact, it’s much better than several high end setups I’ve tested. If you want great sound, buy this and a DR-05 and you’re off. You have to turn the power to “On” on the Tascam under the recording menu. Additionally, if you’re using Premiere Pro, you’ll need to duplicate the left audio channel. Drop the audio onto the timeline, then select the effects panel, choose Audio Effects and then “Fill Left.” It’s pretty amazing. I’ll be buying another Tascam and several more of these. My only issue was the length it took to ship this. (almost 3 weeks, unacceptable) However, that has nothing to do with the quality of the mic. Just be cautious when selecting a shipper."
5,This Suit ROCKS!,"We've all had lives that sometimes are a bit different. Bob Paris has written about his, and how he was able to accomplish his achievements in his personal life as well as in the bodybuilding world. When it became clear that because of Bob's sexual preferance he would never be allowed to reign in the bodybuilding world, the man still had enough awareness of himself to not hide his beliefs. Yes, it cost him in the competitive world of sports but, as this book proves, it made him a better person for acknowledging his beliefs and not trying to hide them and become what everyone in the sport wanted him to be. So many have hidden what they believe. Paris had the guts (and he paid the cost) of not jumping on the bandwagon, but, instead, sticking with his beliefs for himself."
2,"This is not the original version, only the meditation book.","I was sent the softback Meditation book rather than the hard back Technology of the Soul; so I have another order in hoping to recieve the original ""72 Names of God; Techology of the soul"" rather than the abreviated version."
2,Ethiopia up Close,"This profile of Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia is fascinating, questionable, riveting, interesting, challenging, and readable. I've added it to my reference shelf along with other books on the subject."
2,"Long wait, little pay off","I needed a copy of this book for a Child Development class. I knew it wouldn't be perfect but it took too long to get here and it was torn and not bound any more. Fortunately, it was only a penny!"
2,Bluegrass Confederate,"Though not devoid of some human interest value, this is not an especially useful source for the historian. Guerrant saw little action, and writes scantily about what he did see. I can't imagine that most of his sojourns in West Virginia and Kentucky will be of interest to most scholars; there is an account of the Battle of Saltville, but that's about it. Eloquent, not to say melodramatic, jeremiads on the weather make up a good deal of the text.On the other hand, Guerrant was the kind of diarist who thinks that posterity may read his diary someday, and he writes with verve and emotion -- multiple exclamation points, parenthetical clever remarks, and so on. After hundreds of pages -- for a Civil War diary this is exceedingly long -- that gets old, but he undeniably has his moments."
1,Got jagged with feathers all night- not a good pad!,"We got jagged with feathers all night after putting this on my bed.That freaking mattress pad is only 5% down and 95% waterfowl feathers, which are the ones that came out and went thru my regular mattress pad, thru the sheet and into my skin. This is a horrible pad. We had to take it off because it was keeping us awake. I hope I can still send it back.Definitely not recommended!!!No wonder it was such a ""deal"" at $40 instead of $200 Not much of a deal after all.I guess you get what you pay for.Definitely not recommended!!!"
3,"Blue Ridge 2"" Baffle Box Feather Bed, Full","This product slides all over the bed, causing it to have to be remade daily. Also the covering could be better, I have feathers everywhere. On the up side it is very comfortable."
1,Wish I had read the reviews!,"This is the worse thing I've ever bought from Amazon!It's like sleeping on a bed of nails with the feathers, many large, poking through. I put a thick mattress pad over it and the feathers still stuck through.No wonder there's a steep discount. Warning: stay away even if it's free."
1,Terrible Product,"From the dates on the reviews below, it seems we all got suckered by the low price--but this product it HORRIBLE. The package labeling says it has a 210 count ""Down and Feather Proof"" shell.But if you want to experience this product without buying it, just throw a handfull of straight pins in your bed.This stupid thing has drawn BLOOD. I am requesting full refunds from amazon for both sizes that I ordered."
1,Pokey poke poke,"As almost everyone else has already mentioned...the feathers poke through and stab you everywhere, and then you have to vacuum every day to get rid of all the stuff that came out! I bought this as a Gold Box Deal before there were many reviews to read, which was a big mistake. I thought it might get better over time...if enough feathers poked through, it might exhaust its ability to lose feathers, but after a few months it hasn't gotten any better and now it's too late to return it and get my money back. *Sigh*"
4,This Fly Rocks,"Mr. Boston's colloquial style is at once engaging and poignant...True to his nature, he holds nothing back: his triumphs, disappointmentsand even embarassing moments are recounted with wit and humor.Mr. Boston deserves his role as pioneer: not only as a Black man,but also as Chronicler of a crucial moment in Advertising where Social Consciousnessmarried Visual Communications and laid the foundationfor activism today. Too often Graphic Design literature focuses on the work, and by inference on the client, and not enough onthe people behind the work..."
3,hard work,the key for the ab work is the diet. this book is a great guide for what situps to do but you must have a good diet. if your not a beginner than you will read what you already know. however if your not familiar with situps than i would reccomend this for you.
3,Old Silverberg and really a short story,"This is a very old Silverberg and allthough the story reads easily it is a ""childish"" plot. Does not compare to later Silverbergs which to me can very well be classified as literature. This really should not be sold as a book, it is a short story and as such rather expensive for its price."
5,Angels in Pink: Holly's Story,"Very good book it's the 3rd book of the serials. 1st book is Kathleen's Story and the 2nd book is Raina's Story. They are very good books, if you like Lurlene Mcdaniel's books you will like this book. I don't like to read books, but Lurlene Mcdaniel's books I like. Once I start I like to keep reading until it's done."
3,NO NO NO,I am not sure I liked this book all that much. I love Lurlene McDaniel's work but she really killed a perfectly good series with her 2 awful twists that left me in complete shock. I really dont think any of the characters benifited from these two tradigies. Personally I think she could have done a better job with the twists and not have made it so dramatic. I think I will keep to the first and second one because I am jsut so dissapointed!
2,Awesome! But VERY Fragile!!! Not for kids!,"This toy is awesome FOR 15 minuets! However I think that the age specification for this toy is way wrong. This toy is more for collectors or ""Big"" boys! You know ""look but not touch type"" of toy! My son received this for his 5th birthday & he ""LOVES"" all of his trucks & is VERY careful with the construction toys! The boom or arm of the excavator broke after about 20 minutes of play time & it can no longer lift anything! The rubber tracks do fall off VERY easy as well! We have taken the toy apart & it's a little plastic toothed disc that moves the arm (plastic gear I guess), well it's shattered. The box did not come with a parts list or a place where to get replacement parts. Now I have a sad 5 year old who cannot play with this huge & COSTLY toy! Very dissapointed even though ""REAL"" CAT equipment is durable, this ""CAT"" is not!"
5,One of the Best Jewish Cookbooks,"This book brings me back to my mother's kitchen. It brings back memories and even the smells of the Gefilte Fish and the Challah baking in the oven.I made her Artichoke Dip and the people who tasted it,cried.I've been cooking for many years and never have I read such a nostalgic Jewish cookbook.I am waiting with baited breath for her next cookbook."
4,Respectable Regency,"The Rake's Reward has a fairly common story line, one that I have found in several other books recently. Girl is sensible, intelligent and due to progressive-thinking parents, uncommonly well-educated for a 19th century miss. And girl is an accurate description of her age. Man is older, worldlier (and world-weary), and excels as a 19th century version of 007, under the cover of a frivolous playboy. All that aside, the hero and heroine are likeable characters, and the insertion of the evil Marquess element enlivens a what would have otherwise been a dull and routine first half.I can't say I'd consider this book a must-have, but it was an enjoyable and entertaining read. This was my first foray into Mary Kingsley, but I don't think it will be my last."
2,Good Concept -Bad Business,"This group has a great concept and its members are talented; I have no problem with that. My concern is that what makes the concept is the choice of samples. However,there're no credits given for the samples. The members give credits to everybody except the creators of the music that they used. Hopefully they,at least,got the proper clearance to use them. Concept and talent is good but business is business; and this appears to be bad business."
2,"Alot of scenarios, but no good advice","I have this book, and thought by the online reviews it would help. NOT SO! It did have many familiar scenarios in it, but it gave no advice on how to talk to the dreded evil mother- in- law."
5,Very Helpful!,"My husband and I have both struggled with our relationship with his parents. We have stood strong in our union as a couple, but continue to have problems with them. The four of us are seeking counseling now, but this book helped me see their point of view on a lot of issues. It can help good relationships get even better."
3,Good but not what I thought,"I thought this would be more about the callers that don't make it to tv. It was more about the people behind the scenes. I enjoyed it, but it was not what it sounds like."
3,Only used it once,"It works fine and does what it is supposed to do, but I've only used it once. Find a friend that has it and borrow it."
3,good if you want it,it is exactly what i wanted but it didn't come with a cord. lucky for me i dont throw out cords so i had one spare!
5,Great product,"I used it to move my ps3 virtual ps2 saves (which i got from the internet)to my ps2 memory card, and every thing is working even mortal kombat deception save file which is copy protected."
3,too much,"The memory card adapter, while useful, was too much for something with really only a one time use.But it did work well for what I needed it for."
2,PS3 Memory card adaptor,"The PS3 is suppose to be backwards compatible yet in order for me to play a ps2 game (god of war for example) I need a Ps2-USB Controller adapter, just to play the stupid game because it wont read the PS3 wireless controller when you start the game up. Then you need to hook in this memory card adapter just to save ps2 data to the HDD Drive of the PS3 or else you cant save...So now just to play ps2 games I had to buy 2 adaptors and have 3 things dangling from my PS3's USB ports and it looks really trashy. Sony should have thought this out better if it wanted the ps3 to be fully backward compatible and easier to acess for the consumer."
3,Necessity that should of been in the system.,"Basically, if you want to get your saves from your old ps2 and ps1 memory cards, you have to buy one of these. It really should of been included in the ps3, but sony decided not to put it there(probably for more money).The thing is easy to use though. You plug in your memory cards and upload them. No problems with it."
3,Why not GH2?,This adaptor works fine with the Guitar Hero 1 series game but will not work at all with the Guitar Hero 2 series. Real disappointing since that's why I got it in the first place. That is why I give it a 3 star. Other than that it works fine and it is what it is.
3,if you have a ps3..you need this,this should have been included in the system .. if you plan to import all of your ps2 files...you need this....its a no brainer
5,Great single serving product,"Wow this thing works amazing, I only used it once and I will never use it again, there is nothing bad to say about it. I'm going to pass it around to all my friends with PS2s that have backwards compatable PS3s and maybe even return it to the store when I'm done. I didn't get it from Amazon and I wouldn't, cuz really it's easier to take it back to the mall...Ask a friend and borrow theres, really don't buy this Great single serving product...yes it works perfect for about 1 min, thats the time it takes to unpackage it, run and get your old 8mg card plug it in and copy your saves, no joke 1 full minute, I timed it.............o_OIt's a very well made product."
4,Served It's Purpose,"The product itself works fine. No problems there. What bothered me was the cost. After shipping it was about $20 (yeah, I know, I could have saved money by buying it at the store or used). Basically, I paid $20 to transfer my saves over to the PS3 (which took a couple of minutes) and I now have no use for it.Sony should have built a slot in the PS3 for save cards."
4,One time use,"I hate that this was a one time use for me because I just wanted my saved games moved over. I will say though, it worked perfectly and I had no issues with it at all. I am sure it would still work if I needed it!"
3,Not a die hard coffee maker!,We received this coffee maker for Christmas and by mid-June it was brewing so slowly that it would take almost thirty minutes for it to brew half a pot of coffee. We would pour in a full pot and after about an hour get about half a pot of coffee made. It was leaking onto the counter from the underside and who knows where the rest of the water went. We cleaned it and cleaned it and nothing improved. It's in the trash now and we are shopping for a new one.
1,Not such a good cup of coffee,Ok loved this coffee maker at first. But then it stared leaking a bit. So after a few months of that and learning just to put the maker by the sink. Now it has died on me and the pump went out. I only had this maker for 6 months. Gee my last one that still works and I gave away was over 15 yrs old. I should of kept it. Now I am out $50 and I need a new maker.
5,Mindless fun!,"I imported this game and am glad I did. Who cares that I can not read the cut scenes, you don't play a game like this for the story. This game has an unlock feature that grants you secrets the more you play. You get 2 extra fighters, 4 extra colors for outfits, level select, and up to 9 lives. These unlock very quickly and are not much of a challenge to get. Controls are tight and graphics are very good. Great color use, but might be too dark. I'd say this is my fav GBA game. Like I said mindless fun. It also has muliple difficulty settings, easy, normal, hard, very hard and super hard."
2,Decent but not worth (the money),"Final Fight One is one decent game that plays well on the GBA. Each of the characters packs his own punches (pun intended) and there is enough stuff to keep you addicted for a few hours. In the end, unfortunately, it gets boring as you make the same moves over and over again. So you might want to rent it instead of shelling out (money) for a game you won't play many times."
1,What is this crap!!,Someone tell tai to go jump in a lake. Digimon is crap time 1000000000000000000000. Watch pokemon it's worth the money!
1,Just end It!,"Its hard to follow up from season one, before you were excited about every new episode, now it just drags on. You can predict each episode and I swear that veemon gets on my last nerve. I stopped being a pokemon fan when digimon came out, but now, I may go back to my favorite pocket monsters. Minus 4 stars if you think that digimon should just end already."
5,Governing America,Excellent insight into the origins of our government. Some new ways of looking into the hows and whys of our founding fathers. It gives new perspectives and reads much more like a conversation than a textbook. Highly recommended
1,SUCKS,This was the most boring and inane book I have ever read. Are you kidding me with this garbage?
3,Nissan Patrol/Safari,"Limited use, good general book covering essentials. Fails to cover minor model changes adequately. Note seperate books for diesel and petrol versions are available. Manufacturers manual available and worth considering, again there are suppliments depending on the year."
3,A good assortment of SB hikes,"There are several books out there about SB hikes, and this is one of the better for all around ones available in the county. the drawback is that some of them are not really ""hikes"" persee, but rather ""walks"". For instance there are several walks that are about a mile long, on flat terrain, near the city. These are OK to explore, but by no means worthy of an afternoon's hike. However it does have some new takes on some of the old classic hikes such as Seven Falls, Rattlesnake Trail, etc. It is very detailed on how to get to the trails, and how to make the proper turns on the trial. It even throws in some historical or natural facts that are interesting. All in all, a good guide, and very well rounded, but not neccesarily for the regular SB hiker. If you are new or a visitor, it is perfect."
5,Great watch!,If you're even considering this watch...waste no more time and buy it...Does so much for you in terms of exercise and heart rate monitoring to keep you in your zone....the directions are easy to understand. It looks and feels terrific!
1,Disappointing,"I'm not one to post reviews but I was so disappointed with this book. The idea of medical records causing mistakes, deaths, etc. sounded interesting so I gave Deadly Errors a try. But it turned into a farce. The main character is so bland that I just couldn't believe that he'd be the one to take down the forces of evil. The last couple of scenes border on ridiculous as the cardboard Dr. turns into a superhero. Save your $$."
2,Down the chute. . .,"The episode is one of the ""darkest"" of the Voyager series. Harry & Tom are in a prison where no one escapes and the inmates are left to administer their own punishments to each other. This is one of my least favorite although I like the interplay between Harry and Tom."
5,Great Shoe Horn,Great shoe horn. I am currently recovering from knee surgery and cannot bend to put my shoes on my feet. This device makes it so easy. You will not be dissapointed in this item's performance.
1,Sega employees wrote the previous reviews,"This game is nothing like Spawn. This game is garbage. I own Powerstone, and Spawn for the DC, and they are both waaaaaaaay beter than Heavy Metal Geomatrix!!!!First of all, there is no cpu controlled partner. This makes it extremely difficult to beat it on one player. On the last 2 levels, the boss has a partner and you have to beat both of them by yourself. In order to beat the game, I had to force a friend to unwillingly play with me.The arenas for this game are very samll, each stage is just a flat plane. There are no hidden rooms, caves, allyways etc.The characters move very slowly, and they have a small variety of weapons. There are no power ups for speed or weapon damage.I am a fan of Heavy Metal magazine so I expected a great game. This just turned out to be a big disoppintment. Shame on you Sega."
4,A must if you love 4HIM,"Great new cd by the lead singer of 4HIM. Has the classic sounds of 4HIM. Especially loved ""Complete"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Debt of Gratitude"", and the cd ends great with ""King Above All""."
3,Low grade,"I gave 3 stars because this harness does make it a neat and clean install, but it's very low grade, especially for the application of a relay that's rated for 30/40 amps. The wiring strand is of very fine strands with an extremely thick and pliable insulation. Not necessarily bad, but the wire I use has thicker, sturdier strands with tougher, albeit thinner insulation. The terminal ends are the real weak point in this setup. They are very thin and I had to remove each lead and smoosh it so that it would fit tight on the relay blades. I bent one slightly and it cracked the metal where the blade meets the wire crimp. Soldered that to fix. I put it all together, but am wary that it will stand up. Since most wiring is hidden anyway, I may be better off using the usual terminal ends you find at advance auto parts, autozone, home depot, etc. and plugging each one in individually. I bought it though, so I'll use it and will definitely keep checking that connector for any issues."
5,Really Good!,A great little light for quick under the hood jobs when pulling out the drop light is just too much trouble. Support keeps it from rolling away (unlike a flashlight) and adjusts to put light where you want it. Also the little pop up hook is real handy. Cool little product at a good price.
2,disappointing performance of the title role,"I am fond of the Chandos opera in english series; even though my Italian is fluent and my French passable, hearing old favorites in english is often fun--providing a startling immediacy to the drama. But this one really disappointed me with the oddly colorless singing and general coolness of the Rigoletto. That's too bad since we're unlikely to hear an english version again anytime soon."
3,Not for knitting,"I got this light to give a little illumination while knitting in my living room. I find that the angle of the beam falls directly at your lap, which is wonderful for book reading but not so much for knitting. I tend to hold my knitting up a little higher, about 10"" above my lap, and no matter how I pointed the thing it would naturally fall back into position directly into my lap.That being said, the light is nice and strong and the batteries last a long time. It's great for reading books. During the 5 days we were without power due to Hurricane Sandy, I used this in place of a nightlight in my kids room and it lasted through 5 nights and is still going strong."
4,Beam & Read,"I really like my light and use it every night, BUT I wish the neck cord was a little longer- AND I wish the light opened more to shine straight out instead of downward. I use it mostly to knit in bed and have to constantly adjust it to get it focused in the right spot. If I am reading it stays better, but it shifts with the motions of knitting. The concept is great, the price good and I am happier than I have been with any other ""book light."""
3,Earnest but not what I expected.,"I am a riding instructor and am continually looking for more ideas to keep my teaching fresh and interesting. This book is more about teaching techniques than lesson plan ideas. I think that there is definitely a place for a book of this kind, just not what I expected. If you are looking for a book that would be like a college textbook to learn to be a teacher and specifically a riding teacher this would be helpful."
3,Humorous but dated,"After hearing about this album for years, I decided to take the plunge and pick up a copy. While I'm glad I did, I don't see myself listening to it often. It's funny for those that were fans of glam/hair metal in the late 80's, but it sounds dated. It's a good parody, but the songs don't stand on their own."
2,Lace not great,Really pretty bra but the lace is very delicate and I tore it on the first wearing. The lace is also a little scratchy.
4,"Everything you need, unless you're tall","I'm very happy with this purchase. All the exercises and ""weight"" choices allow easy progression from starter conditioning to advanced. The only problem I've had involves my height, 6'5"". I had to buy cable extenders to do any of the stand-up exercises and the seat rail is slightly shorter than optimum for my long legs. These are not great problems and can be overcome but it's something to keep in mind when purchasing. My 5'4"" wife has no difficulties whatsoever."
2,Good if your not serious about lifting.,"I bought this piece of junk for $1000 after shipping. The concept of the machine is a good idea, but the non-linear weight drives me crazy. If your serious about lifting I would get the bowflex dumbbells only (50lbs), an adjustable bench that can hold weight and a barbell with some weights. You can even throw in a pull up bar and you still won't come up to the total of the bowflex. You want a bowflex still? Go to a place like craigslist where people almost give them away free because it's just a bulky clothes rack. I bought this because of the reviews, but obviously nautilus (the parent company) dumped a bunch of money into marketing for this. I think half of these reviews are probably people that are paid to do it. 1 star for sturdy product and another star for concept."
4,need to heat the water,"Polar Pure Water Disinfectant review:Used this product on a 5-day backpacking trip and didn't get sick. Seems to work as described.It does leave the water tasting like iodine, but I found that after about a day I didn't even notice it.The temperature-indicating dot is very faint green, but if you turn the bottle just right you can see it and get the correct dose.One complaint: the bottle states that ""To destroy Giardia cysts, the water must be 20C (68F) minimum"". So... if you're taking your drinking water from cold mountain streams or lakes (or just about any natural source that's not a hot spring) you'll have to fire up the stove each time you want to refill your bottles. It would be nice if this information was in the Amazon product description."
4,Be careful!,"Iodine crystals in a small bottle produce a saturated solution of iodine, which is what you add to a vessel of contaminated water to kill contaminants. It works well, and we used it for many years with great success while visiting 3rd-world countries. Best of all, its footprint in your suitcase is very small compared to a filtration pump.But, beware.Once in Kathmandu, I added it to the filled water pitcher in my hotel room. After walking around the city, I returned to the hotel, poured and drank a glass of ""purified"" water only to realize, after I'd finished it, that the water had no iodine taste. You guessed it. In my absence the maid had refilled the water pitcher and replaced my treated water with tap water. Yes, I came down with a bad case of diarrhea.With water filter pumps, one usually pumps into your own container, and this kind of mistake doesn't happen!Bottom line: it's not the purification process that can get you; it can be where you store the product."
3,have not used it yet..how do I use this?,"I would like to use this, but do not really know how to. Is there a specific bottle I need in order to use this properly?"
5,Great product!!!!,"One bottle can treat up to 2000 liters!!! look at any other product on the market, they dont come close to treating that amount."
3,good...but boil it after,"it gets most of the bad stuff out, but i like to put this in and then boil it for ten minutes to get more bad stuff out. i recommend you do the same."
2,CAUTION - Will NOT function with a PALM T5 !!!!!,"Such a shame - This unit will NOT function with the PalmOne Tungsten T5! I reviewed their website information before my purchase. I did not click on the ""Support"" tab to find a compatibility table deeply buried within... Mea Culpa I guess!I am VERY impressed with the complete package, and included materials. It is truly a shame that now I am left with three choices - 1) Return the unit. 2) Wait for their upgrade (Not likely I'm told by their support people). 3) Buy a used T2 or T3 to complete the package. (I am leaning toward #3 - I really like this unit and its features.....)"
5,Definitive Pickford Biography,"Eileen Whitfield's research and writing make this book a standout. This obviously took years to compile, write, and edit, but the result is a complete, fascinating look at this legendary actress and woman. As I read it, I kept wondering why she hasn't followed up with another Hollywood biography. She's that good."
2,I've had bad luck with this mobile,"The first mobile I brought home was great. It held my 6 week old daughters attention for a long time. The toys are colorful and the music is very pleasnat. After five days of use, the music would stop after a minute. I took it back to TRU in exchange for another one. This time, one of the arms to the mobile is broken. I'm off now for the third time to exchange it, but am not sure if I will try the same one again, or just get another one."
3,Baby loves except for AWFUL SQUEAL SOUND...,"I bought this item for my daughter right after she was born. She loves to look at it and enjoys the music. I like how it pauses for her to focus on and has interchangable toys, HOWEVER.. the white noise sounds awful!! It sounds like t.v. static. She cries anytime it is turned on. ALSO... AFTER ONLY THREE WEEKS OF USE, it developed a terrible high pitched squeak as it spins. THE SQUEAKING NOISE IS SO LOUD that it can be heard from anywhere in our house. We have tried everything imaginable to fix the squeal and nothing helps. It gets worse each time the mobile is used. For this brand name and amount of money, I expected it to last for more than a few weeks!!.....UPDATE: I contacted sassybaby.com and told them about this problem. They are shipping out a replacement arm. SO we will see if this solves the problem. *** I received the new arm and after only one week of use, it has the same awful squeal! Obviously it is made poorly."
3,"Baby loves it, but I can't get all the toys to stay on.","Music is nice, good volume, good timing. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars: the ""stuffed animal"" toys kept falling down and landed on baby. Of course they didn't hurt her (they are very soft and light), but they surprised her and that didn't help her relax! I threw them away and put the plastic toys back on, which is fine because she loves to watch them."
1,Mobile doesn't fit on our crib,"Unfortunately, we never got a chance to try out the mobile -- it didn't fit on our crib. We have a standard Bambino brand crib (one that converts into a youth bed and then into a full-size bed) and the top edge of the crib is too wide to allow the mobile to be attached to it. There is no additional adjustment capability for the mobile, so we simply can't use it.We even considered the wall mount option, but only the mobile's arm gets mounted to the wall, not the music unit -- that means there is no electric source so there's no movement from the mobile -- not really a good substitute.I've written Sassy to see if they have a workaround for this issue. Will update if I find out anything."
2,Doesn't fit on Crib,"We got this mobile as a shower gift and was excited about it. It has classical music, a remote control, and colorful shape and faces we were sure our new baby would enjoy. Come to find out she won't enjoy this mobile at all because it does not fit on her crib. the mobile is designed with a lip to rest on the top of the rail which it is placed and creates a slot for the rail with the beveled screw receptical. The problem is that all the rail on our crib were wider than the slot. So if you have a crib with thick or wide rails be warned that mobile might not work for you."
2,Caution! May not fit your crib,"I registered for this wonderful mobile and received it as a shower gift. When we tried to install it, we found it does not fit our crib. Major disappointment! Be forewarned, if you don't have a standard crib with a very thin top rail, this mobile won't work for you. And the wall mount is pretty much useless since the mobile won't spin when it's not attached to the power unit. I guess we'll be looking for a new mobile."
5,Newborn loves it!,"My newborn loves it and has been enjoying since 1 week old. However, she doesn't like the soft animals yet but I think I'll introduce them to her when she's a little bit older. I do have to say that the toys rattle a bit as they are turning and it gives the feeling that one could fall off. The music plays for a long time and the volume is good. I haven't used the remote yet.I would highly recommend this mobile and am glad that I purchased it."
2,SADLY DISAPPOINTED,"I have to say that I found this book a very slow read. The plot seemed contrived and lacking in focus.I forced myself to keep reading, but at the half-way mark, and STILL feeling no emotional attachment for Tony and Lulu -- not even caring what happened to them, I stopped reading.I realize this is not Ms. Glad's first book, and maybe some of her others are better, but for me IMPERIAL ENGINEER was disappointing."
4,A BEST BETTE!,"Charlotte Chandler --- whose biographical takes on Groucho, Fellini and Hitchcock are considered some of the best --- now takes on Mother Goddamn herself, Miss Bette Davis. What makes the book stand out from the surfeit of other Bette bios are Chandler's candid conversations she had with the actress during the last decade of her life. Riddled with never-before-told stories of intrigues with various actors, producers and directors, they offer a glimpse into the valiant side of Miss D, instead of simply an extension of the parts Davis played. Chandler's talent lie in using her subject's own words, supplemented by recollections of others who knew her, to make an often-told story fluid and fascinating. And the photos ain't bad either. A best Bette!"
2,Been Done Before and Better!!,"I agree with the reviewer below who said there is nothing new here. The author breezes through Davis' life with Davis interjecting here and there. Its been done before and a lot better (notably Whitney Stine's book 'Mother Goddam'). The author writes very poorly as well and the book is labyrinthical and very confusing. One doesn't know when Davis is talking, when the author is talking, or when one of the people whom the author interviewed is talking. Skip this one. Davis deserves better."
2,The Rising,"Not a bad read but the ending is such a train wreck that the rest of the story becomes meaningless. Having to adjust to zombie animals and thinking zombies was bad enough, but this story is leaning toward the fact that these zombies are not zombies at all. Save your money and get something eles"
1,Not True Zombie,"Ok, while the book had good action, I could not get over the fact that this book's zombies were intelligent. That fact alone, ruins this book. Zombies are not intelligent. Try again, author, but with real zombies."
2,The Rising Paperback,"The shipping on this book was fine. However, this book has the smallest print of any book I have ever tried to read. It is literrally a miniature version of a book. It is impossible to read."
2,Mixed feelings.,Some of it was over the top. I really wanted to like this book but I cannot recommend it.
1,A disappointment,"After reading all the glowing reviews on this page I thought I was in for a real treat. Instead I got a plodding, dull, lackluster waste of time. The characters might as well have been stick figures, from the stereotypical hillbilly murderers to the stereotypical bloodthirsty military left-overs. The whole thing ham-handedly staggers to an unsatisfying non-climax that was clearly slapped together to sucker you in to buying the sequel. Frankly I don't care enough about the characters to buy the sequel only to find out if it ended the way it properly should have. If I could give this book less than one star, I would. By all means, save your money and go out and get your hands on ""The Dead"" by Mark Rogers. It is everything this book was not - in other words, a great read."
2,Odd Even for the Zombie Genre,"This is a strange book. The book lost me when they experimented with a tropical fish that became undead and began talking. If you're looking for light reading, superficial characters, and a rather bizarre plot, this book is for you. There is a lot of action in this book but you really have to leave your brain at the door. If you're looking for a thoughtful and provocative look at the zombie phenomenon, I wouldn't recommend it. Take a look at Dying to Live instead."
2,the rising sunk,"While I am a huge fan of all things undead this book was really not that great. The zombies were not very zombie like. Inteligent zombies are an interesting idea, but read I am Legend by Richard Mathewson, okay Mathewson didn't go for zombies per se but close enough. It was silly."
5,Outstanding,"The previous reviewer is obviously illiterate. He not only got the basic plot wrong, but doesn't understand things that were clearly explained in detail in the book, or even grasp what the book was about.This is not a zombie novel for those who grew up on 70's zombies. This is a zombie novel for the new generation: better, stronger, faster."
2,Great Book...crappy ending....there wasn't one!,I found the book to be a real page turner...I got down to the last page...heart raced..held my breath at the ending.......and.....nothing....I flipped the pages....nothing but ads for more books...did I miss something?? Are you kidding me...maybe a page had been torn from the end of my new book....umm..no...you have to buy the next book....man..that one thing ruined...I mean ruinnnned the whole entire book...went from 5 stars to maybe 2 at best before the rug gets pulled out from under you. I WILL NEVER buy one his or the publishing companies books again...I wouldn't even waste my time if I found one laying around at a 2nd hand store for .25 cents.
5,Outstanding Quality,"Kangol products are all made with the highest of quality and style materials. I have been wearing Manhole products for the past thirty years. Kangol is like wine, in that they get better with age in style and quality."
2,Ok !,"It wasnt what I expected, also they sent me the wrong color, considering that it was sent to a APO address, I went ahead and kept it because if I would of mailed it back it would of took forever to get to them. But I did receive it, in less than 2 weeks which is exellent."
5,Very happy,"I am an advanced beginner, and I thhink this book is very good. I learned a lot, and I highly recommend this book to intermediate&+ learners."
5,Long time family favorite,"I think I bought my first copy of this cd when it was released. Great music, and it introduced my kids to music they might not have heard otherwise (John Mitchum? Singing??) Unfortunately, someone else decided they liked it more than we did (they were wrong, by the way, and I don't know who they are, either), and ran off with it when my vehicle was at the car dealership being serviced.Amazon to the rescue! I love this place more and more each day. Reunited my family with the golden favorites, and now there is peace in the valley. Thanks, amazon!"
1,How do you market a third-rate band?,"How do you market a third-rate bar-mitzvah band playing simplistic bubblegum euro-trash with cheesy keyboard generated horns and a drum machine? But wait! Are they not singing in Portuguese, the official language of Brazil, the land of sensuous, infectious, brilliant music by prodigies like Jobim, Buarque, Veloso, Gilberto, Nascimento, Lins? Call the band the name of a chic en vogue party town in Brazil and call the CD ""Brazil Is for Lovers."" And if that does not work, re-release under ""Musical Tour of Brazil."" Am I being too harsh?"
2,Very over priced,Ity is as it looks in the picture but does not make enough of a difference under a dress to make it worth the money.
2,Dont buy them...,"unless you want them to come damaged. The packaging of these was so bad that the larger pan came with 2 dents in it. Also, the quality does not seem to be as good as others I have ordered."
3,Digital music just doesn't do it for us old-timers!,"We listened to the CDs and felt a little cheated, we miss the truer sound you get from vinyl! My guy said he doubted it was really Billy singing...and I bought the CDs for his birthday. Good luck, it was still good to hear the songs anyway."
4,great and full of energy,"This album is great to listen to. Beats are raw. I like the entire album. If you can, you should get it if you like some older stuff."
4,Beware if you have Viking 128MB CF memory,"Everything works... Panasonic 16MB/ Lexar 128 MS, Canon 16MB CF, 8MB SmartMedia. Except the 128 CF by Viking.I email Sandisk support, but has not hear anything back yet."
1,Sandisk 6 in1 has it's limits,"I have tried it with a 512 Sandisk SD memory card. 1st on a win98SE laptop platform, & subsequently on a WinXP desktop w/ USB 2.0In both cases the process starts OK & then stall @ about 15 Second left when copying to the HD on the pc with files over 1MB.The PC then locks up.In win98, a newer driver must be downloaded from Sandisk's website.In Win Xp no driver required.Each port shows up as a different drive letter to allow copying from one type card to another.When the disc copy option is selected only options for other media in this device are listed, along with floppie ( Not HD's )."
2,Looks Good ---- Doesn't work well...............,"I had high hopes for this reader. The specs are great, and the look, feel, and quality are high. This is a nice package. Unfortunately, for the first time in the last 3 or 4 years that I've been using CF cards and all sorts of readers, THIS reader would only recognize 2 out of 6 of my CF cards. It did recognize my one Memory Stick I had.(I'm running XP, by the way.) Going to the Sandisk site and using their instructions for uninstalling/reinstalling the drivers (which involves editing your Registry!) didn't change a thing. I was extremely disappointed, and have returned the unit for a refund. I'm looking now for another brand's USB 2.0 reader to replace it."
2,If only it worked...,"I bought this after reading a few reviews and decided to take a chance. This product was a definite waste of my time. The look and quality of this reader is substantial for the price. The only problem I had was that it only worked occasionally. I have a 256mb lexar 12x compact flash for my digital camera and it seemed to work w/out any problems on my Windows XP. I have a 128mb Sandisk memory stickwhich I use for my clie nx70v and my system froze each time. I used a lexar memory stick and it worked half the time w/out crashing. I emailed Sandisk support and they were very responsive, but unfortunately had no helpful conclusions. I finally had to return this reader and purchased a Dazzle 6 in 1 reader and every card I had worked fine w/out any problems-even though it isn't a usb 2.0 reader."
1,"Let's just say ""no""","I can't say that the publisher-provided information for this item is at all heartening!Tell yourself, ""Hey! I could make a good buck assembling short-run books for other people!"" then buy yourself a copy of Dan Poynter's ""The Self-Publishing Manual."" You'll get information that is more complete, more up-to-date, & substantially cheaper.Incidentally, Poynter never mentions a ""franchise fee"" -- maybe I'll have to ask him what the heck *that* is."
1,Terrible,This is a lack luster book. If you want to read a really great fictional story about the black dahlia case then read Ellroys The Black Dahlia. Collins should stick to Dick Tracy.
1,Come on!!!!!!,I never really liked Nfl Blitz on anything but this is gotten so bad. I agree with pretty much everybody who wrote reviews for this item.This game is just plain awful.
4,Psychology Textbook Review,"This is a decent psychology text book. The information is presented clearly. The chapter starts with a quick story about the information, then info is presented clearly, then a review, then study guide and practice test. Overall an excellent book.The only problem is there are a series of practice test included in the back of the book and they would be very very helpful, but the answers are sold in a workbook that must be purchased separately."
2,Useless unless you are in junior high,"This was the required book for an intro psychology class I took in college. It was a terrible book because it only touches broadly on each subject. The explanations are so broad that there is almost no point in reading them. Even for an introduction class, I was not satisfied. I ended up using a different book entirely, just to understand the real significance of simple concepts."
2,Mastering the World of Psychology,"This was an instructor book in which I did not know when I ordered it. The words ""instructor manual"" was taped over. I was still able to use the book for my course, however, I would have liked to have known this before I purchased it."
1,do not order from textbooks r us.,"I never received my textbook I ordered from this site and its carrier, textbooks r us. The company claims they shipped it out to the post office and the post office claims they never received it. I don't know who is lying but either way I paid expedited shipping for an expensive textbook I needed for class and never received it. All associates I talked to at amazon and textbooks r us were very unhelpful and clueless as to what was going on. Do not order from either site. Try a new book ordering site."
4,Highly entertaining Roy Rogers!,"If you love Roy Rogers and Roy Rogers films this is one of the greatest. Lots of action, shooting and fighting and lots of humour. Mary Hart ( aka Lynne Roberts ) is wonderful, Frank Jaquet is a mean villain, and the else so distinguished Stanley Andrews is a scene stealing sloppy and funny bandit leader. The showdown fight with him and Rogers is fantastic. William Farnum has a touching and moving part wearing the outfit in which we so often have admired him: Black shirt, black trousers, cuffs and an old authentic hat. Lots of ""realibles"" among others Jack Rockwell, Loyd Ingraham, Jack Ingram and Jack Kirk. Why don't I give all five stars? Because the picture quality is acceptable and now and then a little more than acceptable but never quite sharp."
4,OK for the late songs - Good for the early songs,"The Dichterliebe (Opus 48) and the Eichendorff (Opus 39) cycles are both from the 1977 set on Deutsche Grammophon, with Christoph Eschenbach (6 CDs). The rest of the set is from the early 1960s, with Jorg Demus. For those of us who perfer Fischer-Dieskau's earlier performances, I wish they would have used earlier performances throughout the set. There was a period during the sixties where he recorded Dichterliebe alone, three or four times in as many years, for Deutsche Grammophon, so they have plenty of material in archive (you can read reviews in old High-Fidelity magazines). Needless to say, all these songs are in the bigger set and make an interesting comparison. For the most part he is slower here and more sensitive throughout. This set contains no translations."
3,Great recipes,I just hate that the book doesn't have ANY pictures. I think it would be richer if they increased it with at least a few of them. I'd rather pay more and see what the food looks like than opening the book and not feeling like preparing things from it just because I don't really know what it is all about.
2,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,EVERY SONG SOUNDS THE SAME. SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN ABOUT 2 DAYS. DOESNT EVEN COMPARE TO BLACK ARIA I. GUESS ITS TIME FOR GLEN TO RETIRE.
1,Falls flat........,"Listening to this, it's obvious that Danzig is in a decline. Circle of Snakes was rather weak, and this is the icing on the cake.Nowhere near as moving or powerful as Black Aria I, this piece is uninspiring and totally lackluster. Sounds like Era One of Mortiis. Only Mortiis did it better."
5,All I really needed.,"When I get into a new application or technology, I usually just hit Amazon and pick up the majority of books I find. I do this because you usually have to read several books on a topic to get the whole picture. Well, I did the same thing with IIS, but have found that the only one I really needed was this book. It contains full product reference and scripting techniques, along with Internet technologies and how they apply to Enterprise applications. Excellent book!"
1,No useful information,I'm a webmaster who is dealing with IIS for the first time and I found this book to be utterly useless. Doesn't give much information about how or why things are done. It is basically a bunch of screen shots with shallow explainations of the different options. A waste of time and money.
3,Not for very long walks,"I bought this toy as an alternative to my stroller for taking walks around the neighborhood. My son (I bought this for him at 17 months) would get bored in the stroller, so I thought this would be fun. Well, he does really like this car, but there are some issues with it. First, there is no safety belt, so your child can attempt to stand whenever the desire moves them. Second, when pushing him on cement it is extremely loud (my husband wanted me to stop using it for this reason alone--I cannot overemphasize how loud this thing is! We were concerned with hearing loss). Last, although there is a cup holder on the inside for baby, it would be nice to have some type of holder on the exterior for the parents--to hold a beverage, or keys or something. If the wheels were redesigned to make this toy quieter, an exterior cup holder added, and especially a safety belt added I would give this 5 stars. For now, I give it 3."
4,Great toy but no seat belt: i found a solution!,I bought this for my son when he was 9 months old. He too got bored with the stroller. I loved the built in cup holder! The only problem was that since the floorboard was in he would try to stand up. There was no seat belt to secure him in. We found a way to fix the problem: We cut off the staps off an old grocery shopping cart and bolted them into the back of the car. This completely worked and was a life safer. So if anyone needs a seat belt try that.
2,A disappointing read as something was amiss...,Catherine is one of my favorite authors but this book of hers was disappointing as the story was powerful but the execution was poor. Something was seriously missing from the story that kind of left me feeling like it was incomplete..but do read her other books they r amazing...:)
4,Very good struts,"I replaced my factory struts at 100,000 miles. The Monroe struts ride and handle just like the factory struts did when new. I would have given them five stars but I don't know how well they'll hold up. Hopefully, they'll make it to 100,000 with some left to go, just like the factory struts."
3,"Nice size, sturdy, but tough to clean","This is a great wok to use when cooking for many, as it's a good size and the second handle makes even heavier meals manageable. However it's tough to clean, as food sticks quickly when trying to cook healthier (i.e. using less oil). Clean it right away, with some elbow grease, and don't let it soak! Rust will form, which can be scrubbed off, but it makes cleaning that much harder. Overall I've found electric woks to be MUCH easier to clean, more temperature consistent, and a nicer product in general."
5,Just Awesome,"This is just a really nice wok, heavy construction, durable, could probably bang in 16 penny nails with it if you had too. Already seasoned and cooking away, was impressed by the product so far."
4,Lou Costello book,"A good read but surely a few photographes could have been included, especially in a family memoir. Apart from the cover shot, not one!"
2,Overpriced and lacking in details,"This thin ""magazine"" was disappointing in that for less money you can get simillar descriptions of training, along with far more reference type material and general information (it is only 50 pages). The authors clearly think they are the ultimate llama trainers, and you have to tolerate this attitude throughout the book."
1,Awful!,"My husband was crazy about the ""Opie's Funeral"" song heard on Sons of Anarchy. Only place we could find to get the song was this CD. Let me just say that is one expensive song, because it is the ONLY song on the CD worth listening to! Absolutely AWFUL!"
2,"To put it plain and simple, I could ...","To put it plain and simple, I could see nothing that Summer's Eve Feminine Wash did that a regular shower gel cannot do just as well, if not better! The first time I used it, I thought, """"Why would anyone want another huge bottle crowding up their shower!"""" The product smelled relatively good, but my shower gel smells much better! I could see no deodorizing features that would set it apart from my other products. I used it twice, and then retired the bottle to my linen closet where it will probably sit for the next three years. Stick with shower gel. It's not only one less step, but better!"
3,"The Summer's Eve Feminine Wash was okay, but ...","The Summer's Eve Feminine Wash was okay, but I wonder, how necessary is it really? I mean, it smelled nice, and I didn't mind using it, but I thought the same thing could be accomplished with my regular soap. This product did have a fresh scent, and a good lather, but I doubt I would buy the product again. It just seems a little unnecessary."
4,passion,"Synopsis They say her name is Remy Jardin and that she belongs to one of the wealthiest families in New Orleans. That she should forget the masked man that ruthlessly took her past away from her when he struck her unconscious that night at the carnival in Nice. Al her memories gone... just like that. They say it probably will come back, in fragments and quick flashes, like a pussle that needs to be put together. She should just not worry about it. It will happen. It will come back. But among her memories lies a dark secret, information someone could kill for... even a beloved."
3,Wrong photo or wrong part,"The illustration does not look like a PCV valve to me. There are some Ford Taurus models that have a particular plastic PCV valve which screws in and is difficult to access without removing the intake manifold and fuel injector rail block. Typing in Motorcraft EV-243 to a search engine gives varying results. That this photo illustration looks like to me is a special tool to remove the PCV valve, perhaps limiting the amount of removal work to access the valve."
1,Hated It!,This is not a beginner dvd set. She moves way too fast. I should have gotten Pilates instead of this foolishness.
3,Yoga for Beginners Boxed set,"I am very much a beginner in Yoga. I ordered this Yoga for Beginners Boxed set and find it to be great, but slightly slow pace."
4,Good for Beginners,This yoga set is really good for beginners! I had never done yoga before and really wanted to try and hopefully relieve some stress in my life. I really do love and appreciate the Am-Pm yoga for beginners. Its a really good set that I will use often. The background sounds of the waves are also really relaxing and soothing!
4,Good stuff,"I have some trouble playing one the DVDs. It just skips around and won't go to the menu, so I have to skip forward until the DVD player finds a chapter to play. So that's annoying. The other DVDs in the case work great without any problems and the courses are nice."
2,Choppy,"I just got this DVD set yesterday. This morning I did it for the first time and it was very choppy. She gets you to sit up from a pose then there's no transition to her laying down for the next one. There is no actual routine to it. There was no warm up, and I felt more tense then when I started. I would not recommend this set to anyone."
3,"It was ok, but not the best",Each 'workout' is various segments put together and does't flow very well. Was not what I was wanting or looking for.
5,Varied and easy to follow,This set has several sequences that can be combined in a multitude of ways.It is presented in a way that all Yoga practicers can appreciate. It can reach a wide audience.Sometimes it is a bit repetitive. (I lent it to my son and haven't seen it since!)
5,Great for Yoga Newbies....Like Me!,"Since I can only attend one yoga class a week, I wanted to add at least one additional session at home. This set really helped me. There are so many programs on the set, I don't think I will ever get bored. The sessions are carefully demonstrated and explained, and I was able to keep up with the poses even though much of this is quite new to me. I'm really happy with this purchase."
3,only,changed my mind on this series. The language got to me. I no longer read this series. May try it again but not soon.
3,Compelling page-turner with less-than satisfactory ending,"Lilah Brecht, the daughter of a famous actress is assaulted and raped at home while her mother's jewels and some important papers are stolen from her safe. She clings to investigator Peter Decker in a way that makes both him and his wife uneasy. As he delves into Lilah's life, Peter discovers a complex and dysfunctional pattern of behaviour between Lilah's mother and her children. Revelation follows revelation until Peter and his partner Marge finally put all of the pieces together.It a compelling page-turner but somewhat ruined by a less-than satisfactory ending."
4,An Amazing CD,"Let me start out by saying that halifax is one of my absolute favorite bands and in my opinion the are amazing. This album(ep) is very well done.It's filled with guitar riffs and songs that will have you on your feet dancing and singing along. The first track, ""Sydney,"" has a very catchy melody and well written lyrics. My favorite track is ""Broken Glass Syndrome"". It is indeed the best Halifax song I have ever heard. If you are thinking about checking this out... do it. It will be money well spent."
3,"Good Socket, but......","Bought several of these as extreme use 12vdc sockets in my toyota FJ cruiser. These are good heavy duty sockets, but the weather or dust covers, slightly shrink in the heat and loose their ability to seal in time. You eventually find your sockets unprotected and the cover flopped open and loose fitting. This is an easy fix with some electrical tape or a careful bead of silicon. The Socket is tougher than the cover, so keep that in mind."
4,wet friendly,"great for boats in cocpit, deck, or cabin more and more devices are being made for use with dc plugs i keep adding power sourse in my vehicles and boats"
3,An interesting release of an over-released concert,"Yes, this is that same 1969 Toronto concert recording that's been endlessly released (usually under the title ""Freak Out Song""). The song titles are wrong, the performance was poor, the quality's bad and two of the songs aren't even performed by Alice (""Goin' to the River"" and ""Ain't That Just Like a Woman""), they're by Ronnie Hawkins. This is, however, one of the more interesting releases.The ninth track is a re-edited medley (which includes the two Hawkins songs). Also notable, the cover folds out into a two-panel mini poster, which is reminiscent of the one in the ""Hey Stoopid"" CD, with the picture on the cover. I gave it two extra stars for these extras which set it apart from the other (infinite) releases of the concert."
5,Best Soup Pot EVER!,"I bought this pot about 3 years ago - it looks just as good now as it did when I bought it. It's really well made and the best stone pot I've found for this price. Very hardy, too - stands the test of time!"
2,La Stupida (good one) tsk tsk,"Sills is a far better soprano. Sutherland has a cloudy, fuzzy voice and poor diction. Sills' trill is the BEST in the ENTIRE WORLD. Sutherland's voice in the aria ""Poveri fiori"" reminds me of the recently deceased Celia Cruz' raspy voice."
4,This game is fun,"This game is really fun to play and is pretty challenging. The further you go the harder the levels. This game had pretty good graphics and you can do lots of different stuff. The levels are really fun, especially in the second area. I would reccomend this game."
4,Very good compilation for a presixties work on a subject,"Not that broad compilation, but fun to read and the provided sources are well chosen. Unfortunately, interesting part ends with Memphis."
2,This particular product wasn't absorbent enough for my ...,This particular product wasn't absorbent enough for my needs. While I liked the comfortable plastic applicator more than my usual cardboard type I'll have to stick with my current choice as it's more absorbent.
5,"Excellent - Beautiful, very soft leather",Gruppo Italiano Women's Cashmere Lined Leather GloveVery pleased with purchase. Super quick shipping and the glove are exactly as described. Very soft and good quality.
1,Gruppo Itliano Women's Cashmere Gloves,The gloves had to be returned due to improper packaging. I ordered size 6.5 and received gloves that were received in a package marked as 6.5 but were actually size 8.5. The gloves were returned and the cost refunded.
1,it looks nice but the leather quality is...,"I bought one pair for my friend's birhtday day, but the leather is not good. It looks like there are some small holes. It looks like the leather was scrathed by some sharp thing. I had to return them.Also the fingers are extremely long."
1,I wouldn't pay it again!,I usually use clear blue test which is the best but I saw first response test on sale and decided to give it a try. The results are not to be trusted!!
5,CBE Early Test,"I found this product to be a reliable test. It was very clear, and easy to use. I did not use it early, but when I tested a few days late the line was VERY dark, when with other tests I have a light line up to a week late."
2,"I hate alien teachers, their just stupid","This is one of the worst series ever. The plot is very infantile and sadly unfunny. It gets boring after three episodes, as the characters repeat the same sentences all over again. Nothing moves they just sit and think. The whole relationship with an alien teacher seem so weird and untrue. Love hina has more comedy moments. I have better things to do then watch this show, let-along buying the collection DVD."
3,recipes,"I choose this rating because I found this cookbook didn't have as many good recipes as I thought it would. I use it, but not as often as I thought. I was hoping to replace some of my cookbooks, but this was not to be."
1,Does not work,"After getting airbag codes for months,i decided to finally tackle the clockspring replacement.First off,im driving a 1995 ford e-350 club wagon,with the 4.9l engine and c6 transmission.Amazon states this is a direct fit,however after installation the airbag was totally disabled again,along with the horn not working.So after reinstalling the old one everything went back to before the new part install,and diagnosed the new clockspring as being broken.Will never buy another car part on amazon ever again,due to all 3 parts ordered at different times through the year all were non-working upon arrival.I DO NOT recommend buying this product."
4,Good product but faulty instructions,"The exercise bike is fine -- good quality and everything seems to function exactly as expected. My only complaint is that the box contained the assembly instructions for the AD4 model rather than for the Evo, making assembly a bit of a challenge at first. Fortunately, the correct instructions were easily downloadable from the Schwinn web page. The outside of the shipping box did take a little bit of a beating -- not entirely surprising, given the weight and configuration of the device. But the device itself was fine and seemed adequately protected. All in all, I am happy with the purchase and would do it again."
1,Directions are a joke,"I have just received this item and am in the process of putting it together. I'm 59 and have so many assembled gas grills, etc. in my past that I can't keep count. This is the worst experience I've ever had, the more shocking because it's at the hands of a reputable company like Schwinn. The directions are a joke....the text is confusing and uninformative. The drawings are unbelievable.....very small....way too small to give any clue what most of the parts really look like. You just have to take an educated guess. This may be a good product once I get it together, but I'll never buy anything else from Schwinn unless it's already assembled."
3,A GREAT PEICE OF EQUIPMENT AND A FEW PROBLEMS,"The bike is great. The assembly instructions are poor. Amazon customer service could be alot better. I received the bike damaged, either Amazon or UPS is to blame. Don't buy a big item like this from Amazon. Buy local and have them set it up and make sure everything works properly. Once this item is delivered it is your problem.Update: 6 months later and alot of parts, bearings... I have a few of these and love the exercise they provide. Chinese manufatcuring is to blame I'm sure. Some parts are very cheap. Wish I could rerate it to 2 stars."
2,Confusing,"After using this test, I suggest getting testers that show the results in words. This test uses shades of pink. I don't understand why it uses shades of the same color but it's confusing and difficult to be certain that the test is being read correctly. It requires you to carefully match up the test with the instructions and make a determination whether one of the lines is a similar or darker shade of pink than the other line. This becomes annoying when you're testing for several days."
3,CAREFUL THIS IS NOT A UPT!,"I was dissappointed when this came in the mail because the tag on the item that I thought that I bought was for a Urine Pregnancy Test. This is an ovulation test. Much less useful, in fact, I don't care and won't use them. I am NOT trying to get pregnant. I think the information on the product website when you place your order should be more informative."
4,Easy to use,"Although I didn't get pregnant while using this product, it was easy to read and use. I don't blame the product for no pregnancy. It can help, not guarantee a pregnancy. If you are wondering when you ovulate, I would recommend it. I'm pregnant now, about 4 months after trying the First Response Test Kit."
